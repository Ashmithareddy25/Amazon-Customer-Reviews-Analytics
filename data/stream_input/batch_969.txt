B002W6Z0UK|5.0|this simple 8 track album/EP is the best album i've bought all year.  gaga is revolutionary and avant garde.  i didn't get what she was about until i saw her perform live on t.v.  gaga is about music/fashion/performance art.  she has taken musical influences from the '70s, '80s, '90s, and '00s and made a style all her own.  these aren't just catchy dance/pop songs.  this is a master class in creative expression.  i can't wait to see what her next album is like.
B002HNA95E|4.0|Amazon.com    I have serious problems listening the cd number one, track 2, sounds awful, the original version of \\"Music\\" wasn't this. I don't know what to do. I need to know if someone else have the same problem. I am very disappointed bacause I bought the cd's from Chile. How I can register a claim? Thank you!
B002MW50KO|4.0|I really enjoyed this album.  Been listening to Dylan since I was a kid and I'm 62 now.  This is the most un-Dylan like album I've ever heard and I enjoyed every song on it.  The \\"Must Be Santa\\" song keeps popping into one's head throughtout the day.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|My own Blu-ray didn't come from Amazon so I can't address those specific issues, but my version had almost flawless picture (I have a Pioneer plasma which has exceptional black level and I noticed some night time scenes that were a little gray) and the score which embodies so much of the film doesn't drown out the dialogue (I have a 5.1 system, not sure if there is a 7.1 surround track).    As far as the movie goes, obviously without Daniel Day Lewis as the titular role there really is no movie. To say that he embodies the character of Daniel Plainview would be a heavy understatement. The musical score is such a huge part of the film and truly sets the tone for the whole movie, that combined with the gorgeous cinematography I can only wait impatiently for Paul Thomas Anderson's next movie.    For those that have a problem with the ending it's easy to see why you didn't like the movie. The ending pretty much encapsulates the entire point of the movie, a great bloody exclamation as one evil monstrous blood-sucking misquito squashes one of its lesser kin.    But yes, this is the sort of person we all want to see as the steward of our companies, profits before all, greed financing the American dream and all that good stuff. Or maybe we do want some regulation mixed with our capitalism?
0307269981|5.0|I wasn't sure with the first book if the author was slightly twisted, given the content and plot twists. Now with this second book by Larsson, I realize that he is (was--so sad he's dead and won't write anymore beyond on the new one coming out in March) \\"just\\" a gifted ...storyteller.<br /><br />These books are not easy to read with the violence and misogyny perpetrated on some of the characters. Nontheless, the story themselves are interesting and include in this one: trafficking, corruption and so much more. I can't wait for the new book, he left us with the Lissbeth passing out and the responders being called for help. I wish these books were available via Amazon Kindle. And, Lisbeth Sander might be one of my favorite new favorite fictional heroes. Awww, Katniss you have some great company. It's refreshing to see more positive (albeit flawed and human) women characters.
B002HREKCI|5.0|13 Reasons Why, by Jay Asher, is one of the most original books I have ever read (and I've read a lot of books).  It starts off with the main character, Clay, getting a set of cassettes with the voice of the dead girl, Hannah Baker, recorded on them.  Throughout the novel, Hannah explains why she committed suicide, and Clay barely follows along as he learns how he, and others, affected her decision.     Jay Asher does a great job adding twists and turns into the story, and connecting dots in ways you wouldn't have thought possible.  The story is incredibly believable, which is starting to become uncommon in YA, and hauntingly accurate.  He also does a great job in the portrayal of Hannah, showing her sorrow and desperation only through monologue.  The reactions of Clay and the others who have heard the tapes make sense, and are not overly dramatic.  Also, I still can't believe how well thought out and intricate the plot is. It's breathtaking.     There's really nothing wrong with this book, except for the fact that it is a definite tear-jerker.  I recommend reading this, if you're at least 14. It has some elements and themes that are definitely not appropriate for kids.     -EB
B002YIHO7I|5.0|listening to the astounding music on this album made me realize how healing and uplifting sade's music is.  i have missed these guys!  this album is beautiful from beginning to end, and so mesmerizing it was over before i realized it!  if you're a long time fan, like me, you won't be disappointed.  this album is going to be HUGE.  welcome back, sade!!!
B002QVBP5U|5.0|If you like John's lyrics, if you like his playing style, you will enjoy this offering.
0307269981|5.0|I did not particularly like \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. After the first 100 pages of \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" I thought not again, this is boring. Trivial details on what furniture Lisbeth furnishes her apartment with, food she buys. Then something happened, the book took off, and kept on going. I could not put it down. I could not understand what Lisbeth saw in Blomkvist, as he was written very one dimensional in \\"Dragon-Tattoo. This time out you can almost feel the intensity as he sifts though a mountain of leads to get to the truth. Lisbeth was also very one dimensional to me, which could not have been further from the truth. A lean mean fighting machine, she will go the distance with anybody who abuses woman. I also liked the secondary characters on the police force. Bublanski and his female partner Modig complemented each other and the storyline. I guess I still do not see Lisbeth and Blomkvist as the the romantic couple some reviewers have made them out to be. Difficult to get to know, a women of few words/willing to share very little, probably on the autistic spectrum, Lisbeth still touched the lives of many around her. Blomkvist, Armansky, Paolo Roberto, in the midst of overwhelming evidence against her, trusted their instincts and had \\"Lisbeth's back\\". That to me was the essence of the story. This book is highly recommended.
B000ZELISO|5.0|My son got this for Christmas.  Great idea to include Blu-ray and DVD in the same package.  Now we can watch it anywhere in the house as well as on a computer.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is set in futuristic North America in a country called Panem.  Life in North America is over as we know it.  Panem has a center of operations called The Capitol and twelve outlying districts that are titled merely by number.  Each year the Capitol requires two tributes, or sacrifices, from each district to participate in the Hunger Games.  Every name of every boy and girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen are put into a lottery, and one boy and one girl is chosen at random to participate in the annual televised fight to the death.    The story is told from the perspective of Katniss, a sixteen year old girl living with her mother and twelve-year-old sister in District 12.  Her father was killed in a coal mining accident several years ago, and Katniss is now the sole provider for her family.  She feeds her family by hunting illegally in the woods beyond the wire fence that keeps residents from escaping from the District.  When her sister's name is drawn in the lottery, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place.    I first heard about this book from a friend who clipped a review about The Hunger Games and the sequel book, Catching Fire, from Time Magazine.  The idea that struck me most in that review was the last three lines: \\"Kids are physical creatures, and they're not stupid. They know all about violence and power and raw emotions. What's really scary is when adults pretend that such things don't exist.\\"    In this incredible novel, violence and power are central in the lives of all citizens.  The Capitol holds all the power and the citizens of each District live within the prisons of their cities.  People are left to starve to death or are routinely killed for such actions as killing a deer for food or trying to run away.  Medicine is scarce and even the baker's family eats the stale food that doesn't sell.  Children in District 12 live in fear of losing a parent in the coal mines, because without a provider they are doomed to starvation.    When Katniss volunteers to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games, she is joined by Peeta, a boy who she barely knows.  Within a few days of the lottery drawing, Peeta declares to the world that he has always loved Katniss, and suddenly the fight to survive the Killing Arena becomes a game of cunning, violence, love, power, and skill.    Ms. Collins takes us into a world where things are exactly as they seem; corrupt, unfair, destitute and violent.  Nothing is sugar-coated and at least everyone knows where they stand.  Through Katniss, the reader discovers that there is a piece of personal power that can be wielded in a world that seems bent on the destruction of dignity, friendship, compassion, justice, and love.    I wasn't sure if this story would be difficult to stomach and hesitated to begin reading once I bought it from the bookstore.  After several weeks of psyching myself up, I quickly discovered that I couldn't put this book down, and read it even during meal times.  The on-screen romance that Peeta and Katniss purport is strangely non-erotic and entirely believable.  They realized that romance was what the viewers in the Capitol wanted, and they conspired to deliver, realizing that their performance bought them good-will and gifts from sponsors.    I hesitate to categorize this book.  Is it Adventure?  Romance?  Suspense?  Young-Adult?  Truthfully, it is all those things, which is what makes this such a good read.  Young adults will love this, but adults will enjoy this as much as they enjoyed the Harry Potter and Twilight series.  Suzanne Collins joins the ranks of J.K. Rowling and Stephanie Meyer in understanding what kids innately know; the world is a scary, violent place, and no amount of reassurance from parents will change that fact.  She dives head-long into this post-Apocalyptic world, and invites the reader to experience the raw human emotions of greed, violence, power and will to survive.  The world is just as it seems; bent on destruction.  The question is; who will be the winner?
B002W1HBN4|5.0|anyone who's been a fan of whitney's over the past 25 years will appreciate this newly remastered and reissued debut album.  this album brings back so many memories for me.  the remastering is flawless.  they restored the original version of Greatest Love of All.  i was thrilled to have the jellybean remix of How Will I Know.  the best part is the dvd, with the videos, rare live footage, and recent whitney/clive interview.  thanks, whitney/clive!  i hope they do the same for her 2nd and 3rd album (celebrating it's 20th anniversary this year).
0756405890|5.0|This book, for lack of a more descriptive word, is completely amazing. No contest the best book I have ever read. Some reviewers gave this book a less than five star rating... they have no soul, no culture, no grasp of how amazing this book really is. When at the bookstore, about two years ago, I stumbled upon the book. I read the inside summary and thought it sounded kind of odd, but definitely different from other books I've read before. I purchased the book on a whim, with no expectations, never having heard of Patrick Rothfuss. As it was his first published book, I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a completely in depth world, dynamic and believable characters, and a 100% original storyline. I hate spoilers so I'm not going to directly comment on the book, but the book is a story about a man named Kvothe and how he became a legend. The story is told by Kvothe later in his life to a wandering scribe. Kvothe was a legend in his time, almost godlike, and the story explains how he attained his status as a legend throughout his ever changing life. Kvothe is a traveling bard(Musician, actor, etc), a street rat, a thief, a mage, a student, an orphan, an assassin, a king killer. All of the things he is and experiences are so real and emotion inspiring. Nothing in this book is unoriginal, or boring; there are absolutely no slow parts in this book. This book is truly a flawless masterpiece.
B0036EH3TS|1.0|When that crappy Aerosmith came on during the movie, I would have left but was oddly compelled to see if the movie could get any worse.  This movie was on par with Weekend at Bernies II. As they say in Team America, \\"Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?\\"
0780631684|4.0|I couldn't help quoting Sue Sylvester (pun intended) on this one.<br /><br />I'm such a gLeek!<br /><br />Anyways, onto the movie in question...I can't really recommend any of the ludicrous sequels (all of which feel stale and blatantly uninspired in comparison), but I can and will say that the original 2000 `Final Destination', while flawed, is a lot of fun, if by fun you mean a creepy, disturbing frightfest.<br /><br />Yes, that's what I mean.<br /><br />The story is pretty basic, if a little (or a lot) far fetched.  A kid has a paranormal vision of the plane he is on going down in flames.  When he wakes he panics and soon he, and seven others, is ushered off the plane.  Then the Paris bound aircraft takes off, and then explodes.  These lucky individuals have just cheated death, but death doesn't like being cheated and so, one by one, each of the survivors are picked off in eerily mysterious (and painfully manipulated) ways.  Soon, the kid with the vision (his name in the movie is Alex) starts putting two and two together and realizes that they are being killed off in the order they would have died on the plane (really?) and so they have to work together to continually cheat death and start the cycle over again.<br /><br />The cast is decent, but rather uninspired when you consider the genre and the casts of other films of this nature.  None of these `stars' went on to a noteworthy career.  Sawa all but disappeared (well, he did disappear) and Ali Larter may have done `Heroes', but then she did Beyonce, or Beyonce's husband (\\"I'll show you crazy\\") so, I mean, you get my point.  The cast is mediocre at best.<br /><br />When your most successful star is that pervert from the `American Pie' movies then you know you're in trouble.<br /><br />The film is propelled by the elaborately and ridiculously intense death scenes that layer the film.  Whether a boy is getting ready to take a shower or a teacher is preparing some hot tea, this film knows how to layer on the tension.  The deaths are all different, come textured, some shockingly sporadic (that bus came out of nowhere!) and they all hit their mark effortlessly.<br /><br />That's why you watch these `slasher' movies anyways, right...for the diverse death scenes.<br /><br />The ending (in the cabin) gets rather sloppy and a tad overdone, but for the most part this film is slick and unique.  I hate what it turned into (the sequel was decent, but the third and fourth films just feel like cheap reenactments of this film, with no real life to them), but I'm happy with this film as a whole.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it.  If you are a fan of the genre (this is no `Scream', but it's on par with `Urban Legend' or the original `I Know What You Did Last Summer') then this is one you won't want to miss.shockingly sporadic (that bus came out of nowhere!) and they all hit their mark effortlessly.

B001KL3GWM|5.0|Had the album for awhile before I really got into it. Have enjoyed Derek Trucks Band from the first time I heard them. I enjoy the variety of influences. Trucks could have chosen to stick to his Alman Brothers roots and I probably would have bought his albums anyway. One of my favorite guitarists. Agree that vocalist isn't one of my favorites but I have learned to appreciate what he brings to the album.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|It's been a decade since Sade released her last studio LP, \\"Lovers Rock.\\" which was seem by some to be her weakest album (albeit good in its own way; it had to grow on me. But I enjoy it dearly today.)    Her new album \\"Soldier of Love\\", the 1st studio LP in 10 years & only the 6th in the band's 25+ year history is a mixture of the classic Sade sound along with them exploring new sounds. Nonetheless it's still Sade & it's great her voice hasn't changed since her last recordings.    The opener, \\"The Moon & the Sky\\" starts with guitars, giving it a sight Latin/Spanish favor. Later on strings are brought in. It's a wonderful song which sets the mood for the rest of the album.     Soldier of Love: The 1st single. Unless one's been living in a cave, most of us have heard this song by now. The very 1st time I heard this on The Wave (KTWV 94.7 FM) I was worried when she started singing low in the vocal octave. It took only a 2nd listening to really hook me to this song with its military beat (& wonderful music video too!)    Morning Bird: A song with hints of classic Sade. With piano, strings & castanets as accompaniment, she sings in a mournful way that would make Lady Day (Billie Holiday) proud. A song that deserves to be longer than its under 4 minute length.    Babyfather: A song with a touch of reggae. Lyrics tell the story the story of a woman who sees a man at a bus stop as the potential father of her child. Very enjoyable & thankfully not like the rest of the \\"baby daddy\\" songs that came out in the past 15 of so years.    Long Hard Road: A very simple song with guitar & strings in which Sade continues her journey as a warrior of love. A tune that quickly grows on you & short at just over 3 minutes.    Be That Easy: A blues with a touch of Western. It's listenable although those who dislike country music may have an issue with it.    Bring Me Home: One of my favorite songs here with good lyrics. The drums are like a heartbeat & the trance-like guitar gives this onea trip hop sound.    In Another Time: A ballad with hints of classic soul. Kind of reminds me of \\"Jezebel\\" from yesteryear. Love the present of the saxophone here.    Skin: The most contemporary R&B track on the album, with live instruments giving way to drum machines & other in-studio production. While not classic Sade, this is a very enjoyable song with a mini tribute to the late MJ.    The Safest Place: A great closer. It's a wonderful ballad- one that deserves to be longer than its actual length: the shortest song on the album.    All in all, this album is what I expected from Sade & I also believe that most of her fans will also enjoy it, as will most conservative R&B listeners. My only real issue with this is the length-at approximately 42 minutes, it's even shorter than \\"Lovers Rock\\" & the fact that some songs like \\"Morning Bird\\" & the closer deserve to be longer in length.    That said, I only hope we don't have to wait `til 2020 for another album to come out!
B00319ECHE|5.0|THANK YOU!!! This is exactly what I'd hoped for and then some.  From listenting to powershifter for God knows how long, I was a little nervous if the rest of the album would do it justice.  Simply if you love the foundational fear factory sound, YOU WILL LOVE THIS ALBUM. Personally, Fear Factory is everything I could ask for in a band.  If I had the power to create a band, it wouldn't be necessary.  From the machine gun sound of the guitars/drums to the polictally/revolutionary anti NWO lyrics that are so important to our times. I knew before I even heard the tracks and saw Orwell and Jefferson quotes in the cd book, that this was going to be unbelievable.     I actually purchased this twice. Best Buy only had ONE copy of the regular edition and couldn't find the extra tracks on itunes, so I had to buy the special edition on amazon (cause I needed more). For those who love what fear factory is, this will definitely not dissapoint. This will be another ff album that I'll actually think I'd pay 4x for the amount of entertainment it provides.

B002UXRH10|3.0|I'm totally `Team Rihanna' and have been a fan of hers since her debut album.  She has always delivered catchy pop music with an edge and cultural flare that has kept me entertained and kept her `current'.  With recent happenings between her and that ex of hers (utter his name I shall not) her new album carries a much darker aura, and she fuses new and old influences to give us something different.<br /><br />It works, in parts.<br /><br />While genre bending all over every track, Rihanna suffers from untrained focus and actually serves up some stale (and sloppy) tracks amidst an interesting sea of intriguing and complex diversions.  Songs like `Cold Case Love' and `Russian Roulette', while not perfect, are excellent examples of Rihanna thinking outside of the box and delivering something different and exciting.  Songs like `Wait Your Turn' and `Fire Bomb', on the other hand, seem either overly textured, or simply too simple.<br /><br />It's a little disappointing when the best track on this `departure' is actually the one that hits closest to Rihanna's comfort zone (`Hard').<br /><br />I'll get my disappointment out of the way first.<br /><br />My least favorite tracks on this album are unquestionably `Wait Your Turn' and `Te Amo'.  I'll start with `Wait Your Turn', the albums opener.  The verse structure and vocal styling used here is excellent, but the chorus is so bland and uneventful that I quickly grow tired of that track as a whole.  I have no problem with Rihanna throwing around four-letter words, so that isn't an issue.  Seriously though, she sounds almost bored delivering the chorus (and that whole \\"it's just the way the game is played\\" part is off-putting and awkward.  That said, the way she sings the second verse in particular is stellar.  `Te Amo' is just plain bad.  It feels cheap.  She tries to insert Latin influence, but it's beyond bland.  Even the Spanish guitar work seems standard and nothing special or exciting.<br /><br />There is some good to be found in `Fire Bomb', `Photographs' and `The Last Song', but these tracks fall flat in areas as well.  `Fire Bomb' has a nice idea to it, and I like the alternative rock feel to it, but she fails to elevate it in the chorus, delivering another seemingly lazy vocal.  `Photographs' has a great structure and a great lyrical message and it has Will.i.am, so it should be awesome, but the use of auto-tune is disgusting and it gives the song an awful Kanye West feel that just is SO WRONG.  `The Last Song' is a good song, but sadly that's really all there is to say about it.  It's nice, but it isn't special.  It's forgettable, but when listening to it you will easily enjoy it.<br /><br />`Rockstar 101' does seem to try too hard, but it's well constructed and fun to listen to.  This is the edgy, dark and pained Rihanna, and this song kind of nails that.  She's aggressive and in your face, and Slash helps out in making that statement for her.  The lyrical content is a little, 101, but it's forgivable.  Speaking of `trying too hard', `G4L' is one of those songs that is oddly entertaining.  Listening to Rihanna spit about being all gangsta' and killing people and stuff is a little strange, but she actually comes off convincing, sort of.<br /><br />`Russian Roulette' has grown on me.  I didn't like it at all when I first heard it, but I think that may have to do with the fact that I first heard it when the video was premiered, and the video was so consuming it took away from the song for me.  Listening to it separated from the video it starts to make a deeper impact.  Her vocals are forced in areas, but it works with the flow and direction of the album and shows promise in Rihanna's decision to switch things up.  `Cold Case Love' is far too long, but it is probably the most stunning of all the songs when placed in context.  When you consider what she was trying to do with this album, this song instantly captures that with unflinching realism and emotional honesty.  Sure, it doesn't work on all fronts (that whole \\"I needed a witness\\" part is kind of...corny) but it does more than a lot of the other tracks can lay claim to.<br /><br />For me, the best tracks here are easily `Hard' and `Stupid in Love'.  `Hard' is just that, a hard hitting hip-hop influenced track that identifies Rihanna's new `edge' but allows her to slink around in her comfort zone, lacing up the track with her ethnic vocals and booming club beats.  `Stupid in Love' is the stark opposite, tender and fragile and effortlessly moving.  Rihanna sounds impeccable here, and that adds to the strength of this beautifully haunting track.<br /><br />And then there is the tacky awesomeness of `Rude Boy' (Beany, I didn't know Rihanna wrote a song about me!).  Straight out of the islands, this jam recalls Rihanna's first album yet with the mature (well, more adult themed) lyrical content that comes with age in this industry.  It's shameless, but it's a whole lot of fun.<br /><br />In the end this is a work in progress.  I commend Rihanna for trying something so far out of the norm for her, but she still has some more bugs to work out in order to make this work for her.s kind of...corny) but it does more than a lot of the other tracks can lay claim to.

B002JVWR4U|5.0|When will network executives understand that science fiction is not the kiss of death?  The kind of acting and story telling in DOLLHOUSE is what great entertainment is all about.  The abrupt cancellation of FIREFLY is another example.  Why is a series that was only allowed to film a portion of the single season episode a continuing bestseller on the DVD sales charts?  Because the acting and the story telling was so great.  This is going to happen with DOLLHOUSE.  DOLLHOUSE was totally engrossing, involving and fantastic television.  The actors were incredible.  The story lines thought provoking and engaging.  Never a dull moment, never a \\"filler\\" episode.  You do not need to be a science fiction nerd or geek to understand and appreciate what the writers were writing about in DOLLHOUSE.  Good vs. Evil.  Love vs. hate.  Man vs. machine.  Mortality and immortality.  What it means to be human.  Loyalty vs. betrayal.  Epic, epic themes and ideas week after week.  Just because no one understands what Topher says when he is inventing another gadget, just like Mr. Spock on STAR TREK, doesn't mean that the average person can't enjoy the story.  ARGGHHHH!  Bring back DOLLHOUSE!

1400032717|4.0|I was surprised at how much I loved this book, and how engaging it was. Full disclosure: I am sick to death of all the books about autism out there, and I'm tired of having it crammed down my throat. To find this book, though, was a pleasant surprise. Couldn't put it down, and it gave me insight into an autistic mind. Thorougly enjoyable, and humorous, too.     Spoiler alert: 2 things I didn't like: 1) The main character was annoying by the end, and truly \\"only thinks about himself,\\" as one character points out. 2) The mother really shouldn't have been allowed back into Christopher's life.     Highly recommend this book.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|The strong arm of the Law:    The Shield... is a hard hitting and unforgettable \\"Ride Along\\" with one of the toughest COPS ever to hit the \\"Beat\\" on one of Americas toughest city's...  Los Angeles. Ladies and Gentlemen meet Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis, The Commish 1991) and his entire \\"Gang\\" appropriately called \\"The Strike Team\\" an Anti-Gang and Drug Task Force Unit.  The series begins with an introduction to the Men and Women of the Law (who mostly Protect and Serve)  stationed inside a building dubbed \\"The Barn\\" Farmington Districts newest addition (originally concieved to be a deterant for criminals) located in the shell of a former church.  Here the fight against crime begins. Only trouble is Capt. David Aceveda (Benito Martinez, Saw 1) strives to become the first \\"Latino Mayor\\" of the City and he will need the support of the \\"Peoples Vote\\". He concludes the best way to achieve that would be to take down corrupt Cops from inside his own Dept. Who might you suppose his first targets will be? That's right Vic Mackey and \\"The Strike Team\\".  This as you can imagine will not be a smooth transition, 95% of \\"The Barns\\" Very Helpful arrests are made by Vic and his \\"Strike Team\\". Aceveda has gathered some pretty incriminating \\"Intel\\" against Vic and has deployed an undercover officer to join the ranks of \\"The Strike Team\\" in the hopes of capturing the evidence needed to \\"Shut Vic down\\", thus opening the door for Aceveda's \\"Political campaign\\".   Seven seasons of \\"The Shield\\" dictate that Vic will not go down without a fight and it is this premise that will keep the \\"COP Drama Junkie\\" coming back for just \\"One more Hit\\" from this highly addictive T.V. Series \\"The Shield\\".        The Setup:     This Box Set contains all 7 Seasons of the Emmy-Winning (Groundbreaking) Series from Writer Shawn Ryan (Nash Bridges). It is stored in a collectible 34-page bound anthology book filled with photos, quotes and a special letter from Shawn Ryan.   The 28 DVD's included have all 88 episodes including a bonus disc with two never-before-seen featurettes. There are 63 hours of amazing special features from all seven seasons including Commentary tracks from the cast and crew, deleted scenes and much more.        The word on the street:     I had heard allot of rumors from people about this Box Set being poorly put together... The discs were supposedly smashed in between the pages of the 34-page Collector book and pulling them out was known to scratch the discs horribly along with some other packaging issues, a thin plastic layer incasing each DVD to protect the surface of the discs.   The issue (I heard) was that the plastic sleeve would stick to the surface of the discs and leave traces of the plastic behind rendering certain discs unplayable, and you might have to tear apart your book to place them in your own individual Jewel Cases.         The Evidence:       I ordered my set from Amazon for $107 and was surprised when I felt the weight of the Package, a heavy 5 lbs (?). I opened my package and carefully pulled out this coffee table style book that was sleeved in its own plastic casing showing you what is inside and explaining the contents.   I slid out the book (that looks leather bound) and opened up what was the most beautiful collection of quotes and photos from the desks of the more prominent characters from the series, (depicting each of their individual personalities). As promised I found this highly collectible and was more than satisfied.   Not only were the discs placed neatly between the pages (that are actually about a quarter of an inch thick) I did not have much difficulty pulling them out, however I always treat my most valuable collections with \\"TLC\\" and this would be recommended here.   The thin plastic layer reported on was actually what you would find on the screen of a brand new cell phone and it clings to the discs to avoid scratching and I did not find any adhesive issues from the sleeve... In fact it folds in half where theDVD can easily be returned before placing it back in its own slot located on top of its corresponding page (season 1, disc 1 etc...) my advice would be \\"Treat this with kid gloves\\".   The special features were a blast and I felt like I got to \\"Kick it\\" with the \\"Gang\\" of my most beloved and not so beloved, characters from the series...  I personally could not find anything that could make me unhappy with this set and I am more pleased with this product from Amazon than I have been with any of my other (satisfactory) purchases.          Meet The Gang:    THE STRIKE TEAM:  Vic (Michael Chiklis)   Shane (Walton Goggins)   Ronnie (David Rees Snell) and Lemon Head (Kenneth Johnson).    The barn: Dutch (Jay Karnes)  Claudette (CCH Pounder)  Danny (Catherine Dent)  Julien (Michael Jace)      The others: David Aceveda (Benito Martinez)  Kavanaugh (Forest Whitaker)  and Glen Close as Captain Rawling.

0441013597|4.0|Long before \\"Star Wars\\" presented us with a desert world of adventure and intrigue (and for some reason cute creatures who can make a living salvaging robots for scrap on a world that doesn't seem to have much industry and therefore need of robots...), Frank Herbert gave us \\"Dune.\\" It's considered a classic, and \\"Dune\\" is definitely a triumph in world-building, with giant worms and clever bodysuits that capture precious water, the most valuable commodity in such a place. It's also got an intricate plot filled with political machinations that keep the reader on their toes; you can't just breeze through this one and expect all the answers to fall into your lap.    The sole weakness in \\"Dune,\\" at least for me, lay in its characterization. There are far too many two-dimensional characters in this novel, and far too few gray three-dimensional ones (Dr. Yueh was the only one I took any real interest in). This hampers the novel's story, since it limits how much each character can grow and develop. I suppose this is why I can remember Arrakis as a place so clearly, while Paul Atredies is only a blur. I did enjoy the references to family-owned nuclear weapons, though.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|With no expectations going in, I came out thoroughly impressed not only with the artistic styling of this war dramedy, but with the writing. It has such sharp, witty, terse dialogue, like every line was carefully crafted. Each scene (chapter, as it's called in this movie) could stand alone as a minimovie. It deserves every award it gets.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  It does my soul good to know that Sade has not sold out to mass produced garbage.  The album is simply soul satisfying!  My only complaint is having to wait so long for her new music....but well worth the wait.
B00007AJGH|5.0|4.7 stars<br /><br />Roger Rabbit was one of the great eye candy surprises of my life when I saw it in the theatre in '88; it truly deserves to be seen on a big screen. Soooo, it really needs a great blu-ray transfer. Hello, Bob Zemeckis and studio...<br /><br />One thing many fans of this film miss is that it is in fact a very cleverly-disguised conspiracy film; if you know anything about the history of L.A. and its streetcars, etc, you know what I mean. Won't say more for those who haven't seen it yet.<br /><br />But no one misses how perfectly constructed the script and plot are, and how fine Hoskins and Lloyd are in bringing it all to life. Hoskins's work is even more impressive when you watch the extra that shows him acting to the blank bluescreen; the guy hits his marks like a true pro, and his believable conversations with the toons are some amazing acting in every way. The man has imagination!<br /><br />As did the makers of this gem. It's all about Bugs Bunny and friends, of course, and they could never make this now; they got rights to use almost every old toon, and they never would these days, so rejoice that corporate greed was only halfway home in the late 80s (and we thought then it could never get worse, hoho!). Seeing all these characters together only brings home what fabulous art the classic toon makers created. This is made for adults, but kids can watch it with much joy as well. It's both very funny and very clean, no mean feat.<br /><br />The mixed live action/toons are done to near-perfection, and the way the toons slide around the screen adds to the feeling. The first time you see this is a real trip; be prepared and watch it on a big screen if you can.<br /><br />There are some extras here, and they're not bad, but what really matters is we get to see the letterboxed original version, which really matters in a film shot with this much love and care.<br /><br />A true work of art in most every way, the Wabbit deserves a perfect blu-ray transfer, with tons of new extras!!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I just watched this tonight....if you are a fan of Michael's music, this is a must see! His concert tour would have been fabulous, and you get an inside peek at what it would have been.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this album. There are slow/beautiful songs, and fast/powerful songs. There are stories of life, love, loss, and death. Some you can fall deep into and others that you can rock to. All of them are blended together in one coherent album.<br /><br />This is one of the few albums that I listen to straight through. I am addicted to it.<br /><br />Buy this album.
B002XTBE6K|3.0|Austen, of course, loved irony, but she might not appreciate 21st century directors who say how well she connects with people 200 years later, then \\"modernize\\" her books in their productions--to improve the connection. This latest screen presentation, alas, continually reminds us how perfect Miss Garai COULD have been, had this been Austen's Emma--which it is not.      Why? Because, in the 18th and 19th centuries, people at the age of 20 were considered adults and deported themselves with some dignity--especially if they occupied positions of social prominence and responsibility. This is the brilliance of Austen's Emma, the calm, cool, poised Mistress of Hartfield, whom we see grow through her calm, cool, poised--and calamitous--mistakes. Yet, especially in the interactions with Knightly, restrained emotion here is replaced with raised voices and waving gestures, even shouting; and at Box Hill, Emma and Churchill practically roll over the edge of the grassy precipice locked together.     Sadly, this has all the subtlety and none of the impact of a sledgehammer. The best (or worst) example? When Emma crashes, unannounced, into Knightly's library, hysterically slobbers out a relunctant refusal, then lopes off through the field, chased by Mr. Knightly. Good Lord. It's as bad as the scene in the recent production of Persuasion, where Anne Elliot races through Bath, coatless, hatless, heaving and gasping, to catch up with Wentworth.    Sorry, folks, this simply would not have happend in Austen-land, at least not without the author's laugher. Her brilliance was in revealing the emotions behind the outward decorum, not in ripping them out to the exterior (which was the technique of the later Romantic writers).    ALL of these brilliant actors could have delivered on a more understated and accurate portrayal. Had there even been a decent historian on the set, some mistakes could have been avoided--such as Churchill grabbing Emma's waist and watzing her down the empty Assembly Rooms: the waltz was still 25 years in the future, and he would have been cut by every family in town afterwards (especially by a justifiably smug Knightly--who, by the way, did not look to be Emma's elder by 16 months, let alone 16 years).    Having said all that, these great actors pull it off, despite (not because of) the directing, and the production entertains more than it annoys--just. The Eltons were perfect, as was Harriet, whose gentle humility convinces Emma that Knightly finds the young girl appealing. (Miss Bates, however, seems to lack the bustling energy that sparked her endless comments and which Prunella Scales nailed brilliantly.) And to see Miss Garai REALLY radiate, check out Daniel Deronda--where the scriptwriter and director are sensible enough to realize that they do not have more genius than the author.

B002UNMWAG|4.0|Don't get me wrong. I am a huge fan of both movies, but the second one only gets my vote because it receives forgiveness from the first one being so awesome. It is exactly what any BDS fan should have expected. It was corny, cheesy, and an all-around guilty pleasures movie. The acting wasn't great, but EVERYONE in the movie delivered lines better than Channing Tatum could ever dream to. There were a lot of great one liners and frequent BDS(original) references to keep the fans happy. Overall I would give it a 3.5 standalone rating, but (again) because I loved the first one I'd give it a 4.5.    My advice to anyone who hasn't, but would like to see it is don't go in with high expectations. Here is what you should expect. Entertaining one-liners, lots of BDS-references, and simple entertainment. It won't knock your socks off, but if you have an open mind you won't feel that you've wasted your time.
1934030198|3.0|I bought this book because I was completing my first triathlon (done) and heard that this was a great book for triathletes. Its a big text - almost like a phone book, and the content is similarly weighty. There were some bits here and there that I found accessible and useful (but struggled to find them again buried between reams of complicated schedules). The author is no doubt knowledgeable but I think that this is more for a coach or someone who really likes a lot of rules and structure - for example the general training plans are centered around periods broken into \\"Pre Base 1 2 3 Build 1 2 Prep Race Tran\\", each with variable mixes of \\"endurance force speed muscular-endurance anaerobic-endurance power testing\\" - do we really need this level of complexity? I'll stick with something a little more relaxed.  Edited- OK having now been in the sport a couple of years, I have to admit I still go back to the bible a fair bit, and I'm adding a star.  I still think for beginners, Friel's Your First Triathlon would be a better choice.  At the other end, if planning an Ironman, I think his other book, Going Long, which I just purchased, is superior, more accessible and more focused.
B0030MM68O|5.0|I think this was an  awesome movie. We do not see enough of what is going on in Iraq and Afghanistan.. This was well written and very well portrayed.
B002NUULNG|1.0|Ghost in the Shell 2.0 (blu ray) won't play on my Panasonic DMP-BD35 blu ray player (profile 2.0).  It freezes at 00:04 into the movie, and then the player has to be power-reset.  It also freezes if I go through scene selection and choose to start on a later scene.  There is no problem with any of the special features, and the player has no problems with any of my other ~20 blu ray discs.<br /><br />I exchanged one copy of this disc, thinking it was defective.  Amazon sent me a replacement, and it's defective in exactly the same way.
B002LL13BQ|5.0|I have now viewed each (Scotto-Pavarotti and Stratas-Carreras versions)....too many times... and while I know its not a competition- here is what I wish could happen (and can never in reality be).  Teresa Stratas as Mimi, Jose Carreras as Rodolfo (but with Pavarotti's' voice) Keep Maralin Niska as Musetta and Ingvar Wixell as Marcello.  Teresa Stratas acting is matched only by her exquisite voice, a voice that is quite unbelievable, really.  Even as Musetta, Scotto's voice seems a bit harsh and lacking in timbre, for me anyway.  Carreras' acting is rich, measured and full of emotion, much better, I think, than Pavarotti.  His voice is wonderful but seems to me a step down from Luciano's.  Oh well, I highly recommend this DVD for all the right reasons... especially Teresa Stratas!
0312945973|5.0|Other Reviewers-WAWAWA! It's not historically accurate enough. So unbelievable.     WHO CARES? These things should be overlooked because of how stinkin entertaining this book is.
B00007E7K0|3.0|Lens caps were not OEM,although Amazon display implies that they were. Although they do fit the lens, they are even more easily dislodged than the already substandard OEM E85 lens caps, which is a low hurdle indeed! Only positive comment is that the replacement price better matches the poor quality of the replacement compared to the(Canon's) very over-priced originals (by a factor of 2.5X) Even with care bordering on the paranoid , I have managed to have 3 caps lost with only weekend usage over an 8 month period.(And, that refers to the original poorly designed Canon caps. Don't expect much protection from these replacements either)<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP: I was immediately contacted by the vendor( fivestarexperience) after this negative review with an offered postage-paid refund for the items if returned , or simple credit for order minus S/H. This is a very inexpensive product, not worth the trouble to do either.  But the offer did change my opinion/estimation of the vendor! Thank You.! I'd recommend the vendor and would use again. My review of all E58 lens caps and pricing is rather \\"glum\\", however.<br /><br />This is a complex evaluation that mixes both product quality as advertised and vendor...so draw your own conclusion: Product - , Vendor ++ .
B00000J7A2|5.0|Eclectic flavored L.A. worked to make Captain Beefheart an Electric Hit.  1967 and the zeal for the youth market misled many to think that Beefheart magic could be a POP sensation if only shaped and delivered appropriately.  The original tracks cover a wide range of POP factory styles trying to present Vliet as a POP genius of a vocalist.  Didn't work.  Did record a dozen clever and creative POP flights of fancy and nightmarish gleams.  Vliet putting on many different suits and L.A.'s best filling in suitable sounds around the desert blues aficionados allied with Vliet.      Rooted in the blues, that was the base for nearly all things Beefheart, but on this initial outing the management wanted a POP star.  Thought they could get a POP star (starting with the Rolling Stones and the Animals to less resilient in sales US contenders Blues Magoos and Blue Cheer, many other youth market successes had started as blue eyed blues bands).  Vliet wanted it, thought it possible, too (he likes big flashy cars).  Hence L.A.'s best. Hence the trippy POP residuals we find in the originally issued tracks reissued for continued generations to hear.     Most interesting and new to me, having long ago near memorized each guitar slide glissando, doo-wop trill and Therimin swoop of the original release, is to hear the recordings that made Buddah records decide to let CB go where ever else he might be wanted, as they gave up on POPPING the 4 and a half octave voice.  The material canned?  Clearly recorded blues derived psychedelic age guitar glides and Drumbo-matic blues desert tribal pounding.  Listening to these unfinished tracks it finally dawns on me the \\"could have been\\" for the album Strictly Personal.  The echo and phasing did obscure craft that even later supposedly higher tech recording did not capture either.  The extras here reveal the craft within.
B001GCUO52|1.0|I oredered this BluRay when it was advertised as The Final Destination in 3D but when it arrived it was only a @D version and Amazon said there was nothing they could do about recieving the wrong product as the copies they now have are only 2D. After my complaint Amazon changed the Advertised BluRay with the note underneath that early copies were in 3D but now they only stock 2D. Well Amazon you should advertise what your selling not advertise a 3D version and send a 2D version. After many years of using Amazon that is a poor excuse why they sent the wrong version. Stop False advertising Amazon.
B000PHOY0A|4.0|Food.  Plants.  Animals. Geography. Climate.  Politics. Technology.  These are the seven key areas that the author attempts to tie together in his quest  to explain the unequal development of civilizations in different areas of the world from the beginning of mankind to the present.      Diamond starts at the epicenter of human origins, and then proceeds to show how human populations spread over the globe, and then how one civilization  advanced, spread,  and subsequently conquered or extinguished  a lesser civilization in another geographical area in order to absorb it.  There are a vast number of interesting facts of human history interspersed in this chronology.  Near the end, it will become evident why the author presented his sequence of hypothesized events in such a manner.    When the book was written, Jared Diamond  was a professor of physiology at UCLA School of Medicine.  He was trained as a geographer and has spent much of his research  time studying the most primitive, present day humans, the natives of New Guinea.  In this book, he wears many hats, among them being that of a botanist, animal husbandrist, military strategist, epidemiologist, and cultural and physical anthropologist.    There are a lot of fascinating questions about early human civilizations that are answered in this treatise.  Here are several:  When did human history begin? Which country has the most languages?  Which geographical axis is most conducive to the advancement of a civilization?    How did climate changes affect civilizations?  What is the relationship of food, population stability, and political leadership in the advancement of a civilization?  Why was 95% of the Native American population of 20,000,000 decimated in 1492?  Why did 80% of the big, wild mammals in North America become extinct 13,000 years ago?  How did Africa become black, and why is Africa the most diverse human continent?    Any reader of this book will come away with a plethora of knowledge about human history and an appreciation of which forces drove its destiny.  In order to gain this understanding, the reader will have to plod through a very long treatise by the author, which at times the reader will undoubtedly feel is laden with unnecessary technical knowledge.  Some of these topics would include plant and animal species, nutrition, and language development.       This is an excellent and well elucidated account of the history of  human development.  In the epilogue and 2003 update of the original  book, the author attempts to correlate his conclusion of which forces are responsible for the inequalities of human development with the present inequalities in the global, business climate.  Diamond also reveals at the end his conclusion whether environmental or human biological differences make one group of people superior to another.  In that conclusion, he is bound to encounter a lot of resistance.
B001E45XT4|4.0|It really depends what you plan to do with these headphones (obviously aside from the fact your going to listen to some sort of audio thru it):]  But I mean, in terms of gaming (which is what I bought it for), its okay/good.  It really boils down to the person, if your all about high def sound and you want to hear every step from every angle, this isn't for you..  If your someone that doesn't care about that and want a nice pair of headphones for a good price, this is the perfect choice.  Plus, they look nice and it is definitely comfortable on the ears.  My personal favorite part about these headphones is how you can tuck the mic back in once your done, you don't have to worry about it wobbling around on the outer end of the headphones or hanging loose.  At the price this comes for, these are the best headphones you can find, if your willing to spend another $20 for a better headset, I'd definitely advise that
B0000CDL93|5.0|Amazing screenplay put on screen. A three hour journey back into the JFK controversy which shook up America and the world. Costner in rare form gives an unbelievable performance. A must see.
B001GCUO16|4.0|I have always enjoyed the X-Men cartoons and movies, however only occasionally read the comics.  I had fun watching this movie and enjoyed the action, no it isn't going to win awards, but it provided enough entertainment that I will watch it again.  As far as the transfer goes, the quality of the Blu-ray is great for both the video and audio quality.  Additionally, I like these Blu-ray movies that come with the Digital Copy as it lets me take the movie with me when I travel to have my own entertainment instead of paying at a hotel or watching a movie I don't enjoy on a flight.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I will admit that I am a Star trek fan.  I will also be the first to admit that almost all of the previous \\"Star Trek\\" movies didn't have a tremendous amount to offer non-fans.  This movie is the MAJOR exception.  By any name this is a great action movie.  The 2-hours fly by as you enjoy not just a great Star Trek movie, but a great action movie.  Unlike the other Star Treks, no previous knowledge is required to enjoy this one.  Since the movie is a \\"reboot\\" the characters are introduced just like they would be in any other movie.  The actors do a superb job of playing their characters.  The pacing is intense and full of great adventure.  The special effects are top notch.  There is a ton of humor and none of it will come off as an \\"inside joke\\".    For those who were fans of the original series who might have avoided it you don't know what you are missing.  As usual the trio of Kirk, Spock, and Bones get a majority of the face time.  Uhura gets elevated to almost a \\"fourth\\" member of the trio.  She is given a much more important part than just sitting at communications.  Sulu, Pavel, and Mr. Scott have lesser roles but they are all excellent characters.  Personally, I think Bones should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  He is just that good.    As for the script, the movie starts extremely strong before slowing to the normal \\" Rebel without a cause\\" scenes including the perfunctory bar fight.  Once past that ten minutes or so the movie jumps to warp speed and rarely slows.  There is one part that I thought was silly but I guess was needed to advance the plot.  I am intentionally trying to be ambiguous because I don't like people ruining important movie parts for me.    To conclude:    Action A  Story  B+  Acting A  Special Effects A  Music A+    This movie completely captures the \\"action-western in space\\" that Gene Roddenbury had in mind when he first created Star Trek.    One last thing, for those who have long debated who the best Star Trek Captainis this Kirk wins it hands down.
0810983915|4.0|Awkward adolescent Greg Heffley stumbles into more trouble in this, the fourth book in the \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" series.    I didn't get quite as many outright laughs out of this one as I did the first two, but \\"Dog Days\\" is still quite entertaining, with funny and clever twists on Greg's summer-gone-wrong. Worth a read.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Pixar has done it again.  This along with the Incredibles are probably my two favorite Pixar movies.  The first 15 minutes or so could have been a movie all by itself and would have been a fabulous short.  Having Ed Asner as the voice was beautiful, his voice fit the role perfectly.  The interaction between the characters was funny and touching.  Our daughter who was 7 at the time of the movie did find a couple of scenes with the dogs and chases that were a bit too intense for her, however she did find some of the other scenes funny.  She didn't enjoy the 3D quite as much due to having to wear the glasses.    I saw it in 3D at the theater and loved the sense of immersion that provided rather than an \\"in you face\\" 3D experience.  The Blu-ray quality is fabulous and having the digital copy and DVD for use on the go are great.      If you haven't seen this movie it is definitely worth seeing!
B00001ODGR|5.0|My husband plays this dvd daily. He was blown away by the music. I had seen the concert on PBS and was a little disappointed that the dvd was missing three songs from the concert and cd. Besides that, it is great.
B002UD56I6|5.0|This DVD was awesome. It truely shows the talent of Michael Jackson. Wow did he still have it. He danced and sang as if he was a much younger Michael. What I really enjoyed was to see how nice he was to everyone. There were times you could see he could get frustrated, but never once did he take it out on the crew. It was just great. Brillant man he was when it came to music and what people wanted to see. This concert would have been insane. It's sad it never got to happen. Oh yeah.... The dancers in this DVD are excellant as well. Great job. They seemed like kids in a candy store dancing and watching Michael.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|There are a few great tracks on this CD and a few clunkers as well. In all, it's quite listenable and enjoyable and the production value is of high quality. I was however not totally wowed by the album as a whole, just by a few of the songs.<br /><br />That said, I like this album better than the previous one, Lover's Rock. It's more introverted and dark which I dig.
B002QW7AJY|1.0|I'm pretty disappointed I paid $1 to rent this from the local Redbox. That should give you an idea of how bad this is. I was expecting some kind of sci fi plot, but this movie failed to deliver it. It failed to deliver any plot, really. I'd say roughly the first half of the movie you have no idea what's going on, which in some cases would be acceptable, but in a sci fi movie it's bad because you get little or no plot development, making the movie fall flat. There's nothing interesting about sci fi movies that don't include at least some kind of plot development, be it a simple \\"we're going to outer space\\", \\"there are some aliens over there\\" or on the other end of the spectrum, a full-blown, detailed mini-universe like Frank Herbert's Dune. This movie lacks any sort of interesting plot. You know they're on a spaceship and there are these creatures that want to kill them. That's all you get for plot until the last 3 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />The horror element never gets fully developed either; it's a very simple, one-dimensional type of horror that is only scary because there are creatures on the ship that want to kill them. It never gets any more scary than the characters thinking \\"we might die.\\" I won't give away any plot, but after 10 minutes it's not even remotely scary anymore and you really just want to know why the plot is not advancing. It was a bunch of random things going on and you have no idea what to make of all of it. This was beyond frustrating. I kept watching and waiting, hoping it would get interesting. It did not. This movie never advances beyond \\"there are things that want to kill us.\\" That would be fine if they could make it interesting, but this is a short intro, an hour and 15 mins of that, and a quick anti-climactic ending.<br /><br />Finally when we the audience find out what really was going on, it was so incredibly anti-climactic that I really wanted to shout at the tv. This is not a good sci fi movie. This is not a good horror movie. I couldn't think of anything about it that I liked except the first few minutes were interesting. There wasn't even any gratuitous female nudity (a la Starship Troopers) to at least add some redemptive, albeit superficial, value. The fight scenes were pathetic, and technology isn't emphasized as being important. All you get is a spaceship that isn't working like it's supposed to.<br /><br />This movie was not worth the $1 I spent to rent it. I've seen hundreds of movies, and I'm a huge science fiction fan, and this was one of the worst ever. I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed. The depressing thing is that the first 10-15 minutes are actually fairly good, but it just never goes anywhere. If you like being frustrated for an hour and a half and then having an abrupt and anti-climatic finish with no resolution, this is your movie.<br /><br />Update: I'm a big fan of real science fiction: Herbert, Clarke, Heinlein, and Asimov to name a few. They created mini-universes and had real plot in their writing. Movies should have some sort of depth to them or they're boring. Sure it's fun to watch a goofy action/scifi film like Starship Troopers, but even that one had probably ten times as much plot development as Pandorum. This movie does not make you stop and think. It doesn't make you want to watch it again.<br /><br />I see that a lot of people don't find my review helpful. I guess more people need to be exposed to real science fiction, because honestly, this movie is trash. It's not a good action film. It's not a good horror film. It's not a good science fiction film. It's a mash up of various elements that really have no cohesion once you get to the end. This wouldn't even have mattered if it had been entertaining, but it was not. This movie deserves 1 star, so that's how I'm rating it.<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />There are no aliens, they're mutated humans. The movie tag is wrong.<br />The ship landed on the alien planet and was on the ocean floorfor 800 years, so humans who had been given experimental drugs mutated and became these bloodthirsty creatures that somehow were able to mutate and survive on the ship for 800 years. You find all this out in the last few minutes. The movie wraps up quickly and that's it. Boring.
B0000CDL93|1.0|Dear Oliver Stone,    JFK got shot?  You're kidding!  Is he all right?      (Geez, you miss the news one lousy day and you're out of touch.)    Seriously though, I, Yasha J. Banana -- at 96 years-old, the oldest living Amazon movie reviewer (if you call this living) -- personally, I didn't care for the flicker.      Not enough sex.     Okay, so it was about the murder of JFK.  I realize that, Oliver.  But what about all those groovy cheerleaders who were in \\"On Any Given Sunday\\"?  A couple of them couldn't have played the doctors who did the autopsy?  Or maybe one of them could have played the hooker JFK had sex with the night before.         Not many people know this but I, Yasha J. Banana -- nonagenarian, hat blocker and one-time delicatessen manager in Mooseballs, Texas -- I almost got a part in \\"JFK.\\"      Oh yeah!       Your assistant director wanted me to audition for one of the bullets.  But I said, \\"Listen, boychick, let's face it, I'm not as fast as I used to be.  Besides, I'm a Democrat.\\"    Meanwhile, where was Jackie Kennedy in this movie?  You know, the wife.  After all, she saw the whole thing, didn't she?  And yet there wasn't a part for her in the  entire movie?  How come?  What, there weren't any shiksa actresses available at the time?      Nothing personal, Oliver, and don't take this the wrong way but if it was up to me, I'd go against type and cast Joan Rivers as Jackie Kennedy.     Joan Rivers, Jackie Kennedy -- could those gals shop!  But Joan has Jackie beat by a mile.  Reminds me of my fourth wife.  One time she lost her credit card.  But I didn't report it -- why should I -- the person who stole it bought less than she did.  (~Ba-da bing-bing!~)    And Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison.  A nice Gentile fellow; but, honestly, not my cup of tea; I would have preferred Henny Youngman in the role.  (\\"Take my case, please!\\")    Here's Jim Garrison, a beleagured district attorney with a nearly impossible case to prove, and what do you do, Oliver, youget Kevin Costner, a goyische cup, to play the part.  Putz!      If Henny Youngman wasn't available you could have hired *my* lawyer to play the part.  Belongs to a big law firm, \\"Ganef, Ganef, Ganef and Aquinas.\\"  Owns his own ambulance.  (Ba-da bing-bang-bing!)    Meanwhile, what about Jack Ruby, there's another brainstorm of yours.  You get Brian-Doyle Murray, an Irishman, to play the part!  *Jan* Murray would have been more like it.        Oliver, my boy, what were you thinking -- Jack Ruby was Jewish, not Irish.  What was the casting of this movie, restricted?    The only intriguing part of the movie for me was the scene where John Candy is eating in a restaurant.  I'm thinking to myself: did the guy who owned this restaurant take in a partner? -- the place was packed! it looked like it was a gold mine!      Oy, the money I could have made in Mooseballs, Texas with my \\"GENTILES WELCOME\\" concept delicatessan.      If only my \\"Sheep Dip Surprise\\" had caught on.  But who knew?    Anyway, call me sentimental but I felt sorry for that skinny little guy, what's his name, Leo Harvey Oswinkle.  The poor schnook.      Hunted, arrested, taken into custody and questioned, and what? not one policeman gave him a cup coffee, a piece pie?  Okay, so they could have gotten it from the store, but he had to eat, didn't he?      Where's the realism, Oliver Stone?  Where's the versimilitude?  All those newsmen questioning Leon Harvey Oswinkle and not one of them gave him a cookie or an orange to nosh on?  I doubt it.    Okay, Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby was Jewish.  This we know.  He changed his name from Rubenstein to Ruby.  This is an historic fact; and far be it from me, Yasha J. Banana, to suggest that your movie be intentionally inaccurate (ahem!) but what?, you couldn't have changed Jack Ruby's name to Art Linkletter?  Or, better yet, Jack Armstrong.  You know, blame it on the goyim for a change.      Either that or else make Jack Ruby a nebbish, a Woody Allen type.  So that instead of shooting the gun, he drops it.  Big deal, so you change the story around a little bit.  You changed so much, you couldn't have done that?      Historic license!  That's it, that's the ticket, my boy!      You've already got everybody and their brother-in-law in on the plot to kill JFK, so you take a little more license, what's it gonna hurt?  What's JFK gonna do, rise from the dead and sue you, serve you a paper?          Ahhh! but why cry over spilt milk, kosher or otherwise.  You made your movie, you made your millions, so what are you going to do now: from a a 96-year-old man on a fixed income you're going to take advice?  I don't think so.      For when you listen to me, my breath I'm not holding.      But let me just say one more thing so that I can finish this bombastic review and give myself an enema before I go to bed. ... I'm sorry about President Kennedy.  He was a fine man, a regular prince of a fellow.  For weeks I couldn't digest properly, I was so upset.  As far as a normal bowel movement was concerned, forget about it.      A couple hours before he got shot, I ate a pastrami sandwich.  Heard the news, couldn't pass that goddamn pastrami sandwich for three weeks.  A lump the size of Rhode Island in my kishkas.      What a tragedy; the nation suffered, I suffered.  Eventually we found relief.      You know, I have my own conspiracy theory.  Personally I think the pastrami sandwich I ate was a plot.  A plot by the Italians who live down the hall.  From the day I told them Alan Alda was half Jewish, they hated my guts.     Anyway, like I said, it was a shame President Kennedy got shot.  I feel worse about him than about that skinny Jew Abraham Lincoln, when he got shot in the temple.     If only, if only. ... If only JFK had ducked.  Would have been a different story altogether.  Less messy.  If nothing else, he could have gotten an allowance on the upholstery in the car.        But, that aside, let's face it, let's tell thetruth, Ollie baby, you know as well as I do that JFK would have been much better off married to Joan Rivers.  Because if JFK was married to Joan Rivers, when the plane landed in Dallas, forget about Dealey Plaza, she would have dragged him to Nieman-Marcus and they would have shopped all day.  End of story.        Your pal,     Yash    P.S.  Before I go, so that this stupendous review should end with a bang, here's a peppy-perky little ditty I wrote in honor of JFK.     Maestro, if you please ...    ~ My name is Yasha Banana, a fan of JFK. ~  ~ If he had ducked instead of stood he'd be 93-years-old today. ~    ~ He'd be my pal I'd take him to a dance so he could shtup a shiksa. ~  ~ There's still a lot of young gals I know and that's no b.s., mistah. ~    ~ I hear he was an athlete, they say he loved touch football. ~  ~ My only exercise nowadays is keeping track of my sto-ol. ~    ~ Speaking of football, here's a cheer, I hope you find it moving. ~  ~ I'll give it a try, I'll holler real loud, so you won't be disapproving. ~       ~ TWO BITS, FOUR BITS, SIX BITS A DOLLAH! ~  ~ I HAVE MOTZAH BALLS IN MY LOCKER. ~    ~ GOOOOOOOO GOYIM! ~
0307270807|5.0|John LeCarre, said that this was the greatest novel written about war and men. I have to agree; the harrowing grit of each line pulled me from start to finish. This was truly an experience worth the pulling feeling I had from stomach to stern while realizing the subtle ferocity hidden behind each word.     I recomend, 'The Short Timers' by Hasford and 'Johnny Got His Gun' by Dalton Trumbo.

B002YIHO7I|3.0|Sade's sixth studio album, \\"Soldier of Love\\" is here just in time for Valentine's Day.  It very much meets, but doesn't exceed expectations.  If you are a Sade fan, grab this up.  Why do we like this band after so many years?  I would say it's a combination of carefully crafted music, the fine musicians, the consistency, and of course, Ms. Adu.  The band backs up a bit on this one, letting Adu's vocals float over somewhat contemporary production that mostly involves hypnotic backbeats.  It has an electronica quality that prior Sade work did not utilize.  Sadly, the truth even us fans have to acknowledge, is that Adu is a vocalist of limited range.  Her voice hasn't aged one iota, and that's good news to some.  However, it's dangerous to let most of the songs ride on her vocals and the occasionally goofy lyrics alone.  But hey, I'm still listening!    Best tracks : \\"The Moon And The Sky\\", \\"Soldier of Love\\" (which will kick your butt, maybe the most intense song Sade ever recorded!), \\"Bring Me Home\\".    Recommended to all Sade fans, thanks for coming back to us and delivering the goods.  Everyone else, download \\"Soldier of Love\\" if you have never experienced this band or are a doubter.  Like it, but the band has done better work.
B002QW7AJY|5.0|this is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my time here on the planet we call earth i HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone and everyone EXCELLENT just epic
B002YIHO7I|2.0|Sade's newest release is the first one with the boys- Matthewman, Hale and Denman- since Lover's Rock, with a somewhat different vibe.  Going in new directions for artists can be good for them, but now it's time to either take another fork in the road or circle back.  When I first heard the cd, I assumed that she was still working without the fellas.  Once I discovered they were together again, it only added to the disappointment.<br /><br />The music is not cohesive and sometimes feels like they're trying to find the groove.  Remember the show \\"Name That Tune\\"?  Whereas once upon a time you could identify a Sade song in three seconds, now you'd be hard pressed to name any of these after a listen-through, nevermind in three bars or less.  There's a couple of tracks that remind you of the glory days, but they only serve to make the rest seem even more un-Sade like in comparison.<br /><br />Someone once said songs are bad poetry set to music, and this cd is proof of that.  Too many times the lyrics are rambling and repetitive, or else just badly looped clips dropped in like a demo tape.  Sadly her voice suffers also; too many times that sensual, feminine-husky caress feels as rough as sandpaper.<br /><br />As a longtime fan, I'm willing to admit maybe I miss the old glory too much, but after listening to it twice, not one single track caught my attention.  Put it this way: does anyone remember Annie Lennox's Songs Of Mass Destruction? (Anyone?) Well, this is the Sade version.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|So glad to see another release from Sade...hard to believe that I have new music by her on my ipod after 10 years.  After Lovers Rock I was hoping her next album would shy away from the heavy handed percussive 'time keeping' that ran through many of the tracks.  That said my favorite Sade songs deal with love, such as 'Stronger Than Pride' and 'Like A Tattoo'  so I was also hoping for a few slow burn ballads about love and heartache.  The production on this album is much lighter here and  \\"In Another Time' is wonderful there is even some great sax work and the album ends with 'The Safest Place' which will remind you of 'Pearls'-- my only criticism would be the lyrics--sometimes they dont reveal as much as you would like them to and that this is not the romantic follow up to Love Deluxe that I have waited for,  but still enjoyable and  I am happy that we finally have new music.
B0000714BP|5.0|To Wong Foo is a fantastically funny, endearing, lesson of life movie that will make you laugh and cry and feel great about the heroines in this film. Patrick Swayze is phenomenal in this role as a winning contest Drag Queen with Wesley Snipes. His graceful, fluid movements as a beauty drag queen completely denote his skills as a dancer. This movie is worth watching over and over again. It stands the test of time.

B002YIHO7I|2.0|Sorry to end the lovefest that Amazon Reviews so far have produced for this CD, but it's time for a reality check. Undoubtedly, there are those people who are with Sade like I am with Celine Dion, i.e. anything she puts out they will near-automatically love it. Then there are those people will genuinely like Sade's \\"Soldier of Love\\" release. I fall into neither category, just to give you perspective on my objectivity level. Still, I was very excited to learn Sade was coming out with something new as I have grown to really love her music over the past few years, and I was looking forward to this release, as was my father who loves Sade.    I find this CD to be a departure from the sound Sade normally comes with, and that's unfortunate, in my opinion. A few songs maintain her smooth R&B sound, such as \\"The Moon and The Sky,\\" \\"Bring Me Home\\" and \\"Skin.\\" A few more songs like this, and like the title track \\"Soldier of Love,\\" would have resulted in a better rating for this CD for me. It wouldn't have made the CD stand out at all (except \\"Soldier of Love\\"-type tracks), but it would have been a better and more enjoyable final result. However, almost all the other songs are a bit too...how to put it...soft adult pop/rock-ish. A lot of the songs are easy to forget. In fact, \\"Soldier of Love\\" and \\"The Moon and The Sky\\" are the only ones that stood out to me upon first listen and might be the only two songs I'd add to my iPod Touch to ever again play (actually, \\"Soldier of Love\\" has been there for a few weeks prior to the CD release). \\"Soldier of Love\\" does not at all reflect the sound of the CD, either. Although Sade comes with a different sound, in my opinion, on the CD than her usual sound, it's not in the same direction at all as her title track release.     Another disappointing aspect, to me--which is less disappointing than it was at first glance, considering the quality of the CD--is that there are only 10 tracks.     --    Conclusion: for fans of smooth jazz and/or R&B-based music, I think this CD would be a waste of your time and money. I like the, for lack of a better phrase, \\"white\\" Adult Contemporary sound, but not on Sade...it's just not what we've come to look forward to from her. Her voice is as fine as ever, but the music is what will disappoint you unless, as mentioned, you're just someone who will like a Sade release no matter what or you're not expecting more urban sounds from her.

B000PWQPAC|3.0|As the Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex TV series achieved a level of popularity not seen in the franchise since the original GITS anime, a movie followup to the series was a no-brainer. Like some films that act as conclusions to an anime TV series like Fullmetal Alchemist, Ghost Sweeper Mikami, and Nadesico, this brings the entire original cast back together for one last ride.<br /><br />About two years after the second season of the series(2nd Gig), Matoko has left Section 9 to go work on her own. Since then, Togusa has stopped bleaching his hair and become field commander, while Batou is off being picky about which cases he takes. A foreign colonel kills himself on Togusa's watch for fear of a master hacker called the Puppeteer. The colonel's father is an exiled aging dictator under Japanese asylum, who is soon found to be dead by a micromachine virus. Batou goes to arrest someone connected to the virus, but runs into Matoko. He keeps this a secret from the other Section 9 members because he thinks she might actually be the Puppeteer. The investivagation leads into something called the Solid State Society, which is a secret government orginization running under a project titled Noble Rot. where abandonned or orphened children are left to take care of eldery citizens with no one left to leave their inheritence to. The Solid State was actually brainwashing these children and grooming them to be a docile next generation, with the wealth and power coming from their foster parents. They're also responsible for kidnapping thousands of children from abused families. The true Puppeteer turns out to be an individual A.I. that emerged from the collected consciousness of all the puppet personas that Matoka herself used through prosthetic bodies she controlled over the last few years. The children are then sent back to their families, and Matoko rejoins Section 9.<br /><br />Solid State Society was a fine continuation of Stand Alone Complex, it however was a little lacking in the kind of production seen in a theatrical release. The quality was too similar to the that of the TV show, and when you're taking an animated series and turning it into a movie, it has to be a better than the original format. Considering how realistic some of the shots in GITS: Innocence and the recent GITS 2.0 reproduction, SSS should've been more polished than it was. The story fits well together, but anyone who hasn't seen the original SAC series will be pretty lost on some of the nuiances of the plot(like what the hell happened to the Tachikomas!). Unless there's going to be anything more from the GITS anime world in the next few years, this was a fitting finale to Shirow's cyberpunk saga.d of production seen in a theatrical release.

B0026J8LHM|2.0|I had high hopes for this album. The first single, \\"A Rite of Passage\\", rocked solidly and I hoped the rest of the CD would follow suit. Instead, it turned out to be the best of a shaky collection of tracks. Musically, it's all still Dream Theater, but nothing really stands out here like \\"These Walls\\" and \\"Never Enough\\" did on Octavarium, \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" and \\"Vacant/Stream of Consciousness\\" on Train of Thought, or pretty much any track on Awake. As many reviewers here have stated, the weakness is the lyric writing. Maybe some DT fans can excuse it and concentrate on the instrumental bits, but I take my music as a whole, and if the lyrics are weak, it drags the entire song down (see: \\"Nightmare to Remember\\", \\"Count of Tuscany\\").<br /><br />I gather John Petrucci had a bout of writer's block when this album was written (see \\"Wither\\"), to which I say: if you can't write anything good, DON'T WRITE! I'd rather listen to instrumental tracks than Petrucci grasping at straws with stories about a non-fatal car crash and a creepy European gentleman. Next time, let James Labrie and John Myung write some lyrics. I read in an interview that John & Mike stopped taking lyrics from Myung because he didn't approach them with a substantial song to go with them. I advise them to work with him, because even if it took longer to put music to his words, Myung's written some of the most poetic material in the DT catalogue. There's little poetry here.<br /><br />I feel that Dream Theater's been on auto-pilot for the last five years or more, with John & Mike writing and producing the bulk of the material. I wasn't impressed with Systematic Chaos and I'm downright disappointed with Black Clouds. It's time they listened to someone outside their two-man clique. Bands need outside producers because they challenge artists, rein in excess and refine the whole production. My favorite DT album remains Awake, and while having someone else produce may have made the recording process less fun, ityielded a classic album. John & Mike brought Dream Theater back to form with Scenes from a Memory, Six Degrees... and Train of Thought. The last three albums have been a mixed bag. It's time to check their egos at the door and let someone else run the show.

B002TVQ4HG|5.0|WOW! This movie is one incredible experience that is essential viewing for true horror fans as well as those who are starving for an original concept / storyline. Christopher Smith is quickly becoming one of my favorite new writer/directors. He's the creator behind the impressive subway horrorfest 'Creep' and it looks like he's aiming high with this mind-twisting shocker that is completely unpredictable all the way until the satisfying conclusion! This is a movie you won't want to miss! It has a great plot, excellent cast, a strong and confident pace, multiple twists, awesome brutal & bloody attacks, and derives its greatest power from having the viewer empathize with the protagonist's very tough decisions. Seriously, ignore the negative reviews and avoid spoilers at all costs! This is one of those movies you MUST check out! If you wait too long you're sure to hear about it and have the plot twists ruined for you. 'Triangle' is a modern classic.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|I highly recommend this movie. It has a great story line which switches the roles of the invading alians and has a great love story.     If that is not enough there is great cinimatogrpy which combines live actors with a new advaced technology. This makes the film more realistic. It is one of those must see films,which one can not describe and do it justice.    Go see, Or in this case buy it.
B002TVQ4HG|2.0|this is an awful movie. around the 50 minute mark it started to give me a headache. the same actions are repeated over and over again with no explanations (or a lick of sense). finally (and inexplicably) the movie seems to end then start all over again. which i guess is the movie's point, HELL (or maybe life) is a bad movie on a loop. melissa george's good looks and ragged shirt are the movie's only redeeming features.

B0015519VS|4.0|Considering not only his lack of ability to create a consistantly well flowing album but his becomming a father this album actually finds Usher in a very good musical place following his hugely successful [[ASIN:B0002ZYDKQ Confessions]]. There are a number of songs that have this contemporary hip-hop/R&B epic kind of sound that's a little overdone in his case and of course that provided him with the single \\"Love In This Club\\". Now I realize that Usher is having to compete in an R&B world that's heavily populated with a lot of people mining the exact same style to get onto the Top 10 but by this time it's growing a little tired frankly. It's within the album tracks,what some might call \\"filler\\" that the best moments of this album reveal themselves to me. \\"This Ain't Sex\\" is a really strong disco-funk jam that is married to strong writing,really strong singing and a great direction for Usher. \\"What's Your Name\\" with Will I AM provides a heavier electro dance flavor again in keeping with a good direction musically. \\"Something Special\\" has this kind of hooky soulful shuffle to it and strong midtempo rhythm. Interestingly enough this entire album focuses on the subject of Usher wanting to be a good family man and not give into the temptations around him. Because of the strong edge to his lyrical attack he doesn't come off at all as emmasculated and somewhat wimpy the way a lot of male R&B stars have become when tackling the same subject matter. One of the best songs here not only musically but in this same lyrical concept is \\"His Mistakes\\" where Usher assures a lady that he loves her and not to place him in the same catagory as her unfaithful ex because of her past resentment. It showcases that blend of sensitivity and self assuradness that is a necessity with both partners in any romantic coupling. \\"Lifetime\\" is not only sensual and sensative but Usher provides it with a beautifully and somewhat darkly chorded sound that only does the best for what the song is trying to say. The closing title is an equally passionate ballad again with a great mix of intensity,passion and heart. This album has enough strong moments to indicate a positive musical future for Usher. So even if some of it's more contemporary elements that made it a hit aren't it's strongest to me there's more than enough to please pretty much any kind of R&B fan here.for what the song is trying to say.

0385504225|5.0|I figured the next book about Robert Langdon would be more along the lines of Angels and Demons, mostly because the DaVinci Code was just a perfect storm of a wonderful story. But I was pleased with this story, it's background and what I was able to learn about the Nation's capital in a manner that was entertaining.  My husband didn't care for the book because it was full of anxiety and conflict, and he was reading it on vacation where he was looking for rest and relaxation. I enjoyed the the page turning desire it created!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|As a long-time fan of this series, I really enjoyed the newest addition to the movies. My son and I have been reading and now watching all about Harry Potter. 10 years ago, I used Harry Potter to help bond with my son after my husband's death. It was such a wonderful way to introduce my son to the world of reading books. He had always enjoyed being read to but Harry Potter helped him get on the path to reading. Thanks J.K. Rowling!!
B001RTP48Q|4.0|Yes being Pet Shop Boys 10th studio album and 2009 release and is a mix of synthpop and pop. The album has spawned 4 singles. These being \\"Love etc\\", \\"Did you see me coming\\", \\"Beautiful people\\" and \\"All over the world\\". The album was a world wide smash hit and peaked in the top ten in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and the UK. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with a list for each track of whom plays what. Allmusic gave this release 3.5/5 and Rolling Stone 3/5. I think it is slightly better and give it a 4. 4/5.

B002YIHO7I|3.0|I feel about as disappointed with \\"Solider of Love\\", as I was when \\"Lovers Rock\\" was released 9.5 years ago. Sade and Sony are trying to get another one over on us. They did it with Lovers Rock and now this one. Although I must admit Lovers Live was rather nice. My suggestion is MAYSA, A WOMAN IN LOVE, instead of this one. I've been a fan of Sade since 1984 and though disappointed I'm still a fan. The fact of the matter is that all artist have a creative window, which if lucky will be open for about 8 or 9 years. Sade and Sweetback's windows have officially closed!     I was a senior in high school when, Smooth Operator, hit the airwaves. I was known as the tape king, because I practically had the entire high school (including teachers and staff)enrolled in Columbia House record and tape club under me. When you would enroll or \\"introduce\\" someone to the club, you'd receive three free cassettes tapes or albums. I would always suggest \\"Diamond Life\\", to my new inductees, and they would raved about it, once they'd put ear it.     The key word above was cassette tapes and albums. You see back in those days, an artist was confined to the time limitations of cassettes and albums. Artist or groups that really wanted to give a gift to their fans would release double cassettes or double albums. Why couldn't she release a double Cd, with this being her 26th year in the business?  I mean with the release cycle that she's used, we only have 6 studio albums over a 26 year period.    The point that I'm attempting to convey in this space is this; With the advances in technology recording format, IE (Cd)which has the capability of holding at least 72 minutes of music, but most will hold 80 minutes and with the mp3 format being limitless there is no excuse. That being said, I feel a bit slighted when an artist who hasn't released any music in almost 10 years, give me less than 42 minutes of music and this is supposed to be a major release. And more-so not all of the songs are quality songs.    The deal is that the poor blinded fans are going to buy the music simply because it's Sade and you long to hear her voice. Even though the music is sub-par, it doesn't matter to the blinded fan, who just wants to hear Sade.    I've always been of the mind set to demand more from the artist. If the artist is only going to release 10 tracks, at least give me 5 and a half or 6 minutes of quality music per track. Though disappointed, I'm still a fan, but I desire and deserve more. The only reason I'm purchasing the Cd is because I have a gift card, other than that, I'd download it for free.     A $1.29 per song for a mp3 download is still too much, for sub-par music if you ask me. The longer the industry gives me sub par releases the more, I'll download for free.     An artist of Sade's caliber could release a quality song or two a year from her website and I'm confident fans will BUY the music downloads. That's going to be the new model of future.     Lil Louis said it best, in 1992 on I NEED A NEW DANCE BEAT, from his CLUB LONELY release. \\"They use to laugh at me, but I saw the future, dance floor boredom, record company recession and copy machines spit out song after song\\"     I'm wondering if Sade, Sweetback and Sony are laughing at us for purchasing this sub par recording. And before anyone says, it'll grow on me, I'll understanding it later, allow me to say, NO! I understand it now! What I understand is that her most creative years are behind her and the window has closed.
0439023483|5.0|My Thoughts: (Please stand back for an inarticulate gush-fest.)<br /><br />Um, wow. First of all, why did I wait so long to read this?! And second, WHY DID NO ONE FORCE ME TO READ IT SOONER?!<br /><br />I was absolutely stunned by this novel. What's weird is that this story was exactly what I was expecting, yet not what I was expecting at all. Does that make sense? I knew it was dystopian, so I was prepared for the post-apocalyptic state of the world, or Panem to be exact. I knew there was a love triangle, but what a nice twist! And I knew there would be action. That's where I was a bit wary. I'm not huge on books that center around this one piece of action for the whole story. I am raising my white flag and surrendering. If this is the type of action I have been missing, my heart just broke.<br /><br />Suzanne has created the world, or the districts, of Panem so that they crawl off the page with this desolate, clawing motion that just grabs a hold of your heart and doesn't let go. At least, that's what it felt like. I had this huge bout of sympathy for the citizens of District 12, namely Katniss, Prim, and Gale. However, as paragraphs passed, my sympathy turned to fierce encouragement. I was reminded how strong they were, how resourceful. Few books have caused me to have this strong of an emotion, let alone an emotion spurred by a setting.<br /><br />Once in the Arena, my heart turned wholly to the characters. Katniss is a strong, stubborn, sometimes stupid girl, and by far one of favorite female characters in the YA world. I'm seeing an upswing in strong girls as main characters and it absolutely makes my heart sing. Peeta. Oh Peeta. I love him, I hated him, I loved him again. He balanced Katniss perfectly. The other players in the Games were perfect as well. They had just enough back story for me to know whether I should hate them or love them. There was no unnecessary information, and nothing lacking either.<br /><br />The Verdict: On my shelf of favorites, that's for sure. No book has tugged at my heart strings, made me scream, made me cry, or made me laugh as The Hunger Games did.art strings, made me scream, made me cry, or made me laugh as The Hunger Games did.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|\\" Recollection\\" is an impeccably perfect collection of KD Lang songs that brilliantly showcases her boundless vocal range, eclecticism and enrapturing splendor. She can master country, ballads, torch, jazz and light rock. Her vocals can be tender, upbeat, sad, inspiring, enthralling and invariably awesome. \\"Trail Of Broken Hearts\\" is a melancholic marvel. \\"Constant Craving\\" resonates with yearning and will always be a hit. KD's dynamic rendition of \\"The Air That I Breathe\\" is majestic. She transforms Neil Young's \\"Helpless\\" into a song that is equally poignant and assuaging.\\"You're OK\\" is another compelling  vocal performance that literally sends pleasurable audio sensations to your psyche and soul. \\"In The Valley\\" is incredibly emotive and heavenly to listen to. \\"Crying\\" with Ray Orbison is one of the most tremendous songs in music history. Last but not least is her peerless rendition of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" which is beyond amazing.    Each track on this CD is remarkable. There are a few rare tunes and covers that are also exemplary. KD Lang can frequently perform another artist's song better than the original. Ms. Lang is also a proud Lesbian, a humane vegetarian and a peaceful Buddhist. God and/or a Higher Power certainly bestowed such a pleasant person with a celestial and luminous voice that is peerlessly phenomenal.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I've never read a romance novel, but my wife got me to watch The Notebook and I thought it was a pretty decent movie. I decided to get this book for my Kindle and, after the somewhat slow start, I got into it. It's a really good story with a great ending. Of course the ending is debatable by some, but I enjoyed it. My wife and I are going to watch the movie tonight. I have a feeling I will be let down by the movie, as it always is when you read the book first. I already see certain things I don't like, such as the fact that the actor doesn't have any tattoos or muscles and he seems like much more of a \\"pretty boy\\" than Sparks describes him. I am still curious to see how it is. 4 stars only because I'm still not sold on romance novels.

1416594787|5.0|Famous evolutionary biologist and popular science writer Richard Dawkins FRS, FRSL has written this book as the crown upon his work. It finishes his work as Charles Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, a position he is now retiring from. All of Dawkins' books are known for their accessible style and engaging tone while at the same time maintaining a remarkably high level of scientific detail and precision, which is a feat not to be underestimated.<br /><br />This book, \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\", is no exception to that rule. In it, Dawkins sets out to show the scientific evidence for evolution by means of natural selection, in as thorough and engaging a manner as possible. This might seem redundant based on his earlier works, but as he points out, this is not actually the case. In his prior publications, he had pointed to the effects of evolution on other modes of thought, the processes by which it works, and philosophized on its implications. He had however not yet made the case for evolution as such, and he does so now, convincingly and with vigor. Setting out the case, he goes into all the necessary detail about domestication, artificial selection, geological evidence, radiation clocks, DNA and RNA, the tree of life, isolation and speciation, nonadaptive evolution and so forth. Much of this is handled in perhaps more detail than the average person, even if of open mind and good will, can be expected to process in a short time. Nonetheless, the overall effect is clear and unmistakable: evolution by means of natural selection is one of the best proven and documented theories in natural science, and even the pedantic wrangling about the exact meaning of 'theory' and its analogy in gravity etc. is dealt with by Dawkins.<br /><br />As usual with Dawkins' books, the content is unimpeachable - scientific, precise, sufficiently well written, intuitive and accessible. It must be noted that over time his publications show increasing traces of pedantry and Oxford donnishness: he occasionally adds footnotes when he uses 'unusual' words to pre-emptively alert the reader to their meaning, and he bloviates about uninteresting and unrelated topics such as his preference for 'Peking' over 'Beijing'. But this does not seriously obstruct the reading of the book, and on the other side of the coin, this book has been lavishly illustrated with beautiful color pictures enabling one to engage with the beauty of scientific biology even better. Equally as always with Dawkins, one does wonder what sort of person is likely to be wholly against evolution being true, yet at the same time open-minded, intellectually honest and intelligent enough buy the book and follow to the end the often fairly complicated scientific results and statistical reasonings.<br /><br />Notwithstanding that problem, something Dawkins can't do anything about anyway, it is excellent that there be some clear and readable books for the intelligent layman that show once and for all how and why evolution by means of natural selection is simply as true as the fact of the earth revolving around the sun. \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" was written to do this, and it fulfills that purpose admirably.f pedantry and Oxford donnishness: he occasionally adds footnotes when he uses 'unusual' words to pre-emptively alert the reader to their meaning, and he bloviates about uninteresting and unrelated topics such as his preference for 'Peking' over 'Beijing'.

1421527618|5.0|It's too bad the English edition didn't keep the interior artwork from the original Japanese light novel. Even without it, this is an excellent book. Without giving away more than is on the back cover: Private Keiji is a green recruit, about to face his first battle against an implacable and incomprehensible alien foe. He dies, only to wake up and do it all over again. And again. And again. How many painful deaths can he face? Is he trapped alone in a personal hell, or is there a way out? The ending works quite well; like most good war novels, it refuses to allow an easy \\"and they all lived happily ever after!\\" cop-out.<br /><br />Really, the point of the book is about suffering, and how people face it. The old saying is that \\"a coward dies a thousand deaths, a hero dies only once\\". But not poor Keiji: whether a hero or a coward, he dies over and over and over...

When he opened it on Christmas day he was delighted with his present.    Be very aware that this is not a subtle watch in any way shape or form !    Saying all of this it seems to be very good quality with loads of buttons and dials, he loves it and that is what matters really isn't it?
B002I6251G|5.0|In a word, wow. This may be a departure from Editors' previous sound, but boy does it hit the spot. I haven't changed playlists since downloading ITLAOTE a week ago. The sound reminds me of late 80's/early 90's goth (ala Sisters of Mercy, The Cult and Bauhaus), but with an updated, richer blend of synths, guitars and vocals. Oh, yeah, the vocals. The genius of this release (along with some haunting hooks, melodies and lyrics) is Tom Smith's ooey, gooey vocals. He could read the phonebook to me, and I'd still melt.
0060723513|4.0|Midway through reading this book, which to me was very readable, I learned about the controversy that has surrounded it. Simultaneously, I was also struck by how similar it was in some ways to the message of the movie, \\"Avatar\\". If anything, Ms. Morgan is guilty of simply trying to make the story \\"too real\\" by couching it as though she actually did walk across Australia under the direction and tutelage of real \\"Real People\\". The unbridled success of \\"Avatar\\" demonstrates that an openness to this type of message is broad-based, and Ms. Morgan's story predated that movie by long enough to have \\"scooped\\" it if she hadn't run afoul of the Aboriginal sticklers for accuracy.    If those Aboriginals who are so upset would look at the history they so fiercely defend, they might also do well to ask what their ancient culture has accomplished in their very long time in existence. Has their culture given rise to a timeless spiritual and holy tradition that lifts people up and will last for many generations to come? Going by what the critics have written, the real Aborigines have never reached the spiritual status of that small isolated tribe that Ms. Morgan called the \\"Real People\\". Oh, but the Dumbartung did raise an issue about Aboriginal law, that if men learn \\"women's business\\", or women learn \\"men's business\\", they should be put to death! Coming from such a human-rights low point, what moral position do they have, that they could criticize someone who portrayed them as so much more?  Such a display of incredible barbarism - and what gall they have, that the real Aborigines should be so upset that someone portrayed them as having gotten way beyond such primitive customs, even if only in a fictional story. I guess they are proud to be primitive!    After completing the book and studying the controversy surrounding it, I was truly disappointed to learn that the real Aborigines are, apparently, nothing like the ones portrayed in the book, and their culture no more enduring than that of thousands of other cultures, now extinct. The Real People portrayed in the book are so much more interesting and worthy of admiration, IMHO.

This movie was awful and was not really his movie based on screentime. I dont expect to see Van Damme around much longer and he turned down a chance at a big screen comeback with Expendables. Seagal is almost a decade older than him and is back on the big screen in April in Machete and also has a tv series. I've heard that VD will also be in a reality tv show publicising his little fight against that featherweight hasbeen. Is there any doubt that VD will wipe the floor with him and try to make himself look like a real martial artist on the series. Its almost like a saturday morning cartoon.

1932100660|4.0|Let's be honest:  Dr. Colin Campbell is not a great writer.  His book is sprawling with ideas and information, and a good professional editor would have toned down his rhetoric, made simple and concise his language, and structured and organized the chapters more effectively.  One metaphor that he used -- the spread of cancer as though it were infesting a lawn -- I strenuously objected to, and would have instead explained cancer in this manner:  a body is a complex nation where, because of bad policies and bad government, a general level of disaffectation arises to the level that certain organs declare open rebellion against the kingdom.  And some readers will find it dissatisfying and bewildering how Dr. Campbell violently jumps from one topic to the next.  There is no denying that Dr. Campbell is not a good writer, but there's also no denying that Dr. Campbell is a great scientist.     Having achieved a formidable amount of success and fame and wealth Dr. Campbell, at age 70 when he wrote this book, has decided, because it's the right and necessary thing for him to do as a doctor, to challenge the profession, the industry, and the society that has conferred such success, fame, and wealth on him.  Powerfully persuasive and relentlessly committed, Dr. Campbell explains why a plant-based diet is far more nutritious than an animal-based diet.  In fact, an animal-based diet is, according to Dr. Campbell, the main reason why obesity and cancer are so prevalent and pervasive in North America.  Baseball is quintessentially American and so is apple pie and so is heart disease, writes Dr. Campbell in anger and frustration.      The evidence is overwhelming:  vegetarians live a healthier, happier, and longer life than non-vegetarians.  In fact, Dr. Campbell himslf converted from a good farm-boy who drank two quarts of milk a day to a staunch vegetarian who raised his boys as vegetarians.  He cites the example of the Phillipines where the affluent are ironically unhealthier than the poor because they consume so much protein.  Then there is the massive China study where Dr. Campbell and his research team discovered that Chinese consume more calories but are much thinner than Americans.  Chinese are much more likely to die from diseases of poverty (for example, tuberculosis), but Americans are much more likely to die from diseases of affluence (for example, heart disease).    But despite the overwhelming evidence -- in fact, as Dr. Campbell asserts quite convincingly, a lot of this is obvious, common sense, and have been known in Western culture at least since Socrates -- Americans are still choosing to live unhealthy lives.  There's that macho culture that insists that eating meat is manly, but there's also a silent conspiracy among healthcare practitioners, the United States government (especially those in charge of food and nutrition), and the food industry to keep Americans eating meat and drinking milk, no matter what the long-term individual and social costs are.  In fact, Dr. Campbell even gives examples of researchers and doctors who are paid to spy on and sabotage unfavorable (in other words, objective and unbiased) nutrition research.  Then there are those doctors who have been black-listed because they dared speak the truth.     \\"The China Study\\" is a powerfully persuasive book that should be mandatory reading in schools all around the world.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Being a product of the end of the \\"Baby Boomers\\" PINK FLOYD was the music of my formative years.  Unlike most people, I think that \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is the best album of Pink Floyd.  \\"Pulse\\" is a really good compilation of most of the greatest music from the group.  From the beginning track of \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" to the next to last \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (and the last track is good, too!) I throughly love this album/dvd.  With overcomming the personal issues that permeate among the band, it was great to see them come together and do a spectacular concert.  I would recommend this to any fan of Pink Floyd as they will have a fantastic set of music from one of the greatest groups of the 60's-90's!

0689865384|5.0|Uglies had been on my To Read list for a very long time. It just was not very high up on my list. Lately I have had a fascination with all things dystopian and the box set was cheap on Amazon so I thought, Why Not? I'm so happy I bought them!<br /><br />The book seemed a little slow at first. We jumped right into the world without much explanation or background but it didn't take long to figure things out. After that I had a very hard time setting this book down.<br />The whole concept of the story and the world is completely genius! And completely frightening at the same time. This seems like something that could actually happen! I guess that's true for a lot of dystopian books. That's probably why I like them so much too. Westerfeld's world building is incredibly done.<br /><br />All the characters were easy to connect to and well written. At times I wanted to shake Tally but I think that is a natural reaction and one that the author wanted us to have. I felt the fear, distrust and horror that these characters felt at their situation.<br /><br />All in all Uglies was a fantastic read. I can't wait to devour all of the series and Westerfeld's other books as well.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|Often disjointed, and filmed in documentary style, District 9 is a parable, a cautionary tale, and great sci-fi.  As the story unfolds, the very worst of human nature is revealed through the character of Wikas, an Everyman, whose powerful father in law runs the organization known as MUA.  Wikas is in charge of relocating the alien residents of the shantytown known as District 9 to a 'better' ghetto known as District 8, farther from Johannesburg.  Wikas is very proud of his new responsibility and hams it up for the documentary camera as it follows him around his office, in the vehicle en route to District 9, and as he and his team knock on doors, alternately cajoling and threatening the 'prawns' into signing the eviction order.  Wikas stumbles onto the prawns' secret though his patronizing paternalism leaves him blind as to its significance.<br /><br />Things begin to deteriorate for Wikas, and in a lesser movie, his misfortunes would cause his evolution into a hero.  Instead, he's so hapless, MUA and Wikas' father-in-law seem twice as evil as they move to crush him and the prawns. There are lots of bad guys in this movie, and very few good guys.  Wikas runs afoul of everyone, and finds out firsthand about the life he so cavalierly imposed on the prawns. I don't think revealing this much of the plot will spoil the movie for anyone.<br /><br />District 9 is thought provoking, stark and cynical.  According to the filmmakers, mankind has learned nothing from history, and will continue to marginalize and mistreat the powerless until they rebel.  It's a brilliant movie, difficult to watch. It took me two tries to get through it, but it's haunted me ever since.  THAT'S a good movie!
0451228731|2.0|I found this book both good and bad.  There is a lot of interesting information on state-of-the-art (and beyond) computer capabilities.  It starts off being very clever with some intriguing situations and characters.  Unfortunately most of these characters are not well-developed and one begins to lose interest in them.  The plot quickly goes from intriguing technological possibilities to implausible and mindless butchery.  The philosophical musings are shallow. As for the ending, I think that a book ought to be able to stand on its own and not end without resolution in a very obvious attempt to get readers to purchase the author's next work.
B002ZG4Q5W|1.0|After the cancellation of Criterion's Blu-ray last year, I was hopeful that Studio Canal would have the sense to use their new transfer.  Alas, this is the work of amateurs!

This is a rarity for me, I shuffel cds and go to Itunes looking for new music like a junkie and now I have my fix, thank you Mars.     This is War, Vox Populi, Search and Destroy hits to the core making you want to fight, to change things, with Stranger in a Strange Land, L490 leaving chills up your spine. Alibi and Hurricane bringing tears to your eyes, and Night of the Hunter and Closer to the Edge you want to dance to, even though you know the lyrics are wrenching at your heart. Kings and Queens is us Americans living way beyond our means and now paying the price.     Mars Army backs up Jared's seductive whispers and heartwrenching vocals, Shananimal's drums vibrates thru your soul and Tomo's chords bring you to a new dimension. Jared said at the Hive this week that we were not consistant with voting on the next new single, that the votes changed rapidly the only consistant one being \\"This Is War\\" the title (not his exact words). Well the reason for that Jared, is each song is for a different mood, sooooooo it changes daily, and if we love them all, it is really hard to pick the best if they are all good!

The extras that involve the cast from TOS are really well done.     The only thing about the \\"pc / mobile device digital version\\" is that you have to download it and get the DRM involved. If apple has taught us anything, it's that DRM is to be avoided at all costs.

0385504225|2.0|The Lost Symbol might as well have been called The Albrecht Durer Code (though that doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well).  It follows the same tired and true formula that made Dan Brown filthy rich with his previous thriller---including many of the same flaws, but often even worse.<br /><br />There are too many such flaws to go into specifics, so I'll just discuss a few in general terms.  For starters, the plot is surprisingly predictable, despite some glaring holes calculated to accommodate what are supposed to be shocking twists.  Also, despite having obviously done loads of research, Brown sometimes gets his facts wrong---whether he deliberately distorts them to suit his purposes and hopes the reader won't notice, or whether he just flubbed it, it's difficult to tell.<br /><br />Then there is the ridiculous pseudo-scientific premise, which is far more wildly implausible than that of The Da Vinci Code.  Brown basically buys into, and propagandizes for, a New Age interpretation of every brand of mysticism in history he comes across---faith healing, astral projection, the Deepak Chopra interpretation of quantum mechanics, and on and on.

B000I0QL82|5.0|One of our favorite Christmas classics; we watch this every year.  A great family film with great values, we can now watch year round.
B002TSIMEC|2.0|The Lost Symbol might as well have been called The Albrecht Durer Code (though that doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well).

For starters, the plot is surprisingly predictable, despite some glaring holes calculated to accommodate what are supposed to be shocking twists.

B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|Henry Roth lives in a Hawaiian paradise with the company of endless women with no strings attached. This is until he meets Lucy Whitmore. Both Henry and Lucy enjoy the company of each other and feels the start of a serious relationship occurring. Approaching Lucy the next day, Henry is confused when Lucy fails to recognise him. This is the moment Henry discovers that Lucy actually suffers from short term memory loss and can't remember each individual day. Henry won't let this stop him and is prepared to make her fall in love with him all over again, each and every day. The plot, even if somewhat contrived, is clever and in the context of the movie believable: there is a good beginning, middle and surprisingly satisfying end. This is quite simply a very enjoyable movie. It's not, perhaps, a great movie, but it is fun and leave you feeling pleasantly content.

B00003CXBK|5.0|I just watched the DVD today, I probably not the first person to mentioned this, so here goes. 25 minutes into the movie, I said to myself, haven't I seen this movie like in the last 6 weeks, OH YEAH!!, It's AVATAR ! the story line, the characters, the overt themes, the forest background, the little faires. Enough said, I still enjoyed both films. By the way I just found out that James Cameron is a huge J-Anime fan. Thank you.
B00063F8B2|5.0|i am very happy with this purchase, it is nice music to play during the holiday season
0451450523|2.0|I was not very impressed with this book.  The characters were not very likeable and they didn't even seem to like each other.  I came very close to not finishing the book after the scene with the butterfly.  This book appears to be written in medieval times, yet the butterfly is talking about a \\"sale\\" and \\"all things must go\\" and singing \\"won't you come home Bill Bailey...\\"  I sort of got the feeling that the butterfly was on drugs - or maybe it was the author...  I thought at the beginning that the Unicorn would be a character I could enjoy, but she turned out to be not very nice either.  I don't think there were any happy people or animals in this book at all, come to think of it...but, to each his own.  You should give the book a try if you are interested.
B001FB55H6|3.0|It's so frustraiting to purchase a product because you love it and want to support it to have the stuido/company release the \\"ultimate\\" version just months later.  The move was very enjoyable, but now this product is basically worthless since it's lacking so many more things that are in the ultimate edition.  It reminds me of what they did with Sin-City.  Either you buy the newest edition and support the idea that they can keep doing this to the fans and getting even more out of us, or stand your ground and miss out on the extras!

0060531053|5.0|The title says enough.  If you're new to brewing, or would like a stronger foundation then using online resources this is the book for you.  I have heard great things about John Palmers How to Brew as well.  This has been my go to book when I started years ago and is the book that I buy for/loan to others interested in homebrewing.  No point in wasting more time writing this review...I need to get back to brewing!  Cheers!
0061703257|5.0|Written as a supernatural thriller told from a Private Investigator's perspective, \\"Shutter Island\\" is a suspenseful edge-of-the-seat story.  A brisk pace helps heighten the tension, as U. S. Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule are sent to Shutter Island, an Alcatraz Island for the criminally insane, to investigate the mysterious - and seemingly impossible - disappearance/escape of a beautiful female patient from Ashcliffe Hospital.  As the two uncover further clues and interview the physicians and staff, they quickly realize Shutter Island has skeletons in the closet, a possible background of illegal and experimental treatments on patients, and the misleading facts about the facility are hindered by hospital medical personal who are not telling the whole truth.<br /><br />Wedged between clues and misdirection, the suspense in this novel stretches until novel completion.  Parallels can be drawn to various other suspense thrillers - most notably Sixth Sense - but they're not so obvious as belie the paranoia or to minimize the success of the intricately twisted psychological storyline.  Determining the villains and truths is the primary enjoyment while reading Dennis Lehane's great follow-up to Mystic River, and the absence of ostentatious verbiage makes it an easy, quick read.<br /><br />This book is great, and I eagerly await the movie adaptation.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|The era depicted in the film is the turbulent 1960's. Like FORREST GUMP, the film lightly hits on the major events of the decade. The Vietnam War, rise of FOLKIES in SOHO, and Teenagers falling in love.    The film, like the sixties, metaphorically uses the music of the BEATLES as a soundtrack. The major characters are named for persons mentioned in BEATLES SONGS (i.e. Prudence, JoJo, Sexy Sadie, Dr. Robert, etc.)    The film is (SGT?) Peppered with Cameos, BONO, Eddie Izzard, Joe Cocker, etc.) and uses the most amazing visuals to tie in the sometimes Psychedelic lyrics of the BEATLES very smoothly into the events of the basic storyline:  \\"A Boy from Liverpool journey's to America to meet his biological father, only to feels stranded, and eventually meets a GIRL, who he falls in love with at first sight. Sadly, She's taken, and her boyfriend is due to head for Vietnam. NUFF SAID...the tender love story is even more touching than...well, LOVE STORY.

THE SAME GOES FOR THE BIG BANG BOXED SET AND I ONLY PAID $[...] BUCKS USED FOR THAT ONE. IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE DISCS ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT'S WORTH IT, BUT I ALSO HATE ALL THOSE BLASTED PRESEQUENCING MENU ITEMS BECAUSE OF THE LAYERS OF THE DISCS, SOMETIMES I JUST WANT TO SEE THE CONCERT STRAIT UP WITH NO INTERUPTIONS.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video aftering trying a few others that I felt silly doing the more dance type dvds that you don't want to do infront of others. After watching the DVD first to get a view of the moves I was eager to start. I found that even though this DVD is only 20 minutes it's a workout. I use to go to the gym 5 days a week and never got the results I wanted. Now after 2 short weeks I can already tell this is working. I have lost a lot of fat off of my body mostly my thighs and tummy area and feel great. I am now starting level 3 so we will see what happens. All together so far I have lost 6lbs with only using this DVD and diet. I consume around 1300 calories a day. I love this DVD so much that once I am confortable doing level 3 I'm just going to start doing two level at one time. Oh yes and my husband is now working out with me as well and he loves it too.
142313494X|5.0|I bought this book for my 10 year old son and he LOVED it!  He read every book in the series, and would re-read The Lightning Thief again as he waited for the new books to  come out.  I bet he has read it at least 5 times cover to cover.  I highly recommend these books!
B00000DI06|5.0|I have been affiliated with the South Hills Chorale in Pittsburgh, PA, for many, many years.  The first time we sang Rutter's Magnificat, a number of years ago, it was unavailable via CD in our local record stores (we wished to use it as a practice vehicle).  The Chorale sang it this past Christmas (2009), and I was overjoyed to find it via Amazon, directed by Rutter, and sung by the Cambridge Singers.  The piece is exciting, energetic, melodic, and incredibly beautiful, with a Spanish flavor.  I enjoyed very much turning up the volume, absorbing the dynamics and energy, and practicing while listening to the CD.  Rutter's music is inspirational, and this particular CD showcasing this particular piece of music is very well done.  In my opinion, people who do not readily accept (or admit to) any sort of leaning toward classical music would be able to (indeed would be eager to) grasp this work with enthusiasm, joy, and understanding.  Magical.  Excellent CD.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|This new album \\"Soldier of Love\\" is really great.  how could anyone not like it.  Some people don't have good taste and don't know a good artist when they hear one, music is not about the trashy lyrics, not about the graphicness of things or the Misogyny of women.    the old people have to teach the new about the quality.  :)    this new album speaks volumes of greatness, the group has taken years off, the live life to the fullest, and write and sing about the battlefield of love.  they sing about loss and pain.  the highlights of the Cd is   \\"The Moon & The SKy\\" so thought provoking, Sade seem to singing only you, so beautifully written and sang.  \\"Morning Bird\\", you sang me into life, so emotional, so intense.  \\"IN Another TIme\\", I Love Stuart on the Sax, great job.  \\"The Safest Place\\" just lovely, not words to describe it.    Sade has long been missed, yet cherished over the years, so wise beyond her years.  I recommend this album for 2010 album collectors.
0517548232|4.0|I am glad I read this.  It has taught me that if the free market thinkers of today were to have their way (that of absolutely no government intervention or regulation of the markets or trade), the US would turn into one giant sweat shop over night.  I've had discussions with these types of people who will argue till their face turns blue about how Wal-Mart has actually INCREASED Americans' living standards!      Think if there was no minimum wage and no social security or medicare/medicaid.  It would be a disaster!  1/2 the population's income would be cut in half, PLUS they'd have to take care of their elderly AND buy their medications!  What on earth would they have left to live off of?      Even John Keynes said, \\"Capitalism is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone.\\"  Personally, I would replace \\"astounding\\" with \\"ridiculous\\".      This book seems also to be a bible of types to international capitalists such as Peter Schiff.  These people have no allegiances to any country.  Peter Schiff, for all the honesty and sincerity he exudes, is playing a big part in the capital flight from the US that will prove to play a huge part in our eventual demise.  They're bailing out on us!  They're jumping ship, these excessively wealthy international capitalists.  They're jumping on the next boat -China.  And they're leaving us here to drown.  I would say \\"shame on them\\"... but that doesn't quite cut it.      This is an important read.  But read it critically.
B002IVLH60|1.0|Backspacer is really just a regular rock album that may draw all the Nickelback, Sevendust, and Kid Rock fans to its corner. If you want to listen to some great Pearl Jam music,than may i suggest their bootleg albums?<br />Pearl Jam's strength has always been live concert recordings anyway. Only true Die-hard PJ fans know this. If you haven't heard any live stuff yet, then I recommend going to their web site and purchasing one of their 2-disk live albums instead of the hum-drum Backspacer.<br /><br />I fear that Pearl Jam has put out a cd that was desinged to attract a more main stream audience rather than just their fans. I know people who could care less about Pearl Jam and bought this latest record because it was trendy. Wow! Pearl Jam Records were never trendy before this one. It may have paid off for the band as far as sales are concerned, but there is a huge contrast between the \\"Backspacer\\" album and their 2006 release of their self titled cd which was alot more guttural and original. I would hate to see them striving for the U2 type of notoriety.
B00009MGR6|4.0|I just listened to this lost AC/DC album today out of the blue, really I had forgotten just how good these songs sound now. It's been about a 8-9 year period since I last listened to AC/DC's 88' spinner \\"Blow Up Your Video\\". Man, what a trip and what fun. I don't know why but it always found it's way into my stereo when I first got it before falling to the wayside amongst other competing CD's. People argue that this album sounded horribly dated but to me it has aged well and is just ear candy.<br /><br />It's been fairly bashed by many AC/DC fans along with Fly On The Wall (hell, the whole post Back In Black era) as their worst effort. Complaints of lackluster songs, a \\"boxed\\" sounding production, too 80's sounding for AC/DC, poor mixing, $ hitty lyrics, Brian Johnson's ailing vocals, ect abound by the bucket load when people mention 80s and AC/DC in the same sentence. I don't care. Blow Up Your Video was great fun. I don't understand why this album got panned when it came out? I thought that this had some of the band's strongest and most criminally neglected songs. I mean, who can't be addicted to songs like \\"Mean streak\\" or \\"Kissin' Dynamite\\"? What about the classic \\"That's the way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll\\"? \\"Go Zone\\"? Or my personal favorite \\"Two's Up\\". But of course it's the weakest song on the album that gets the video  (Heat seeker, which I honestly don't care for) and the only number from BUYV that has been played live, go figure. I have yet to see(ahem, hear) them play ANYTHING else found here. Angus and Malcolm brothers Young really stepped it up and churned out some killer @ssed riffs on this one. You can tell they boys wanted to go \\"back to basics\\" by doing more blues based songs and getting big brother George back behind the knobs.The production does sound dated but it's solid although Brian's voice does have this weird reverb effect...<br /><br />While it's not in the same realm as AC/DC's glory days, Blow Up Your Video is still packs a powerful jolt, especially since they were way past their prime here. The Back In Black fan core babies can trash this all they want, I will be rocking out to this lost AC/DC gem on road trips. Just because it failed on a commercial level doesn't mean you can't get serious volts to this beast. Defiantly a recommended buy and breath of fresh air if your sick of their FM RaDio HiTz.ey were way past their prime here.

0307454541|5.0|Mystery, suspense, great dialog, and intriguing analysis of personal relationships are just some of reasons why you will find yourself immersed in Stieg Larson's first novel.<br /><br />This fast paced exciting novel centers around an investigation being conducted by Mikael Blomkvist, a somewhat burnt out journalist, who is on self imposed exile from his editorial duties at Millenium magazine due to an ongoing trumped up libel suit.  Blomkvist is hired by an elderly, emotionally plagued, rich industrialist, to use his investigative skillset in trying to solve the 35 year old mystery of his missing 16 year old niece.<br /><br />Larsen's description of his characters are vivid.  It appears each member of the secluded Vanger clan sports some type of phobia, depression, or anxiety disorder.  Wait to you meet Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood, tattooed, computer geek who assists Blomkvist in the investigation.<br /><br />This nearly 600 page fiction is a quick read due to the literary prowness of Larsen.  You will not be disappointed.  5 stars

B00164KYV4|5.0|First of all, what's not to like about Jennifer Aniston. Secondly, this is a movie about why men don't commit (although by the end of the movie most do) and has value beyond its entertainment value. Its an easy watch with the right amount of humor and plot that keeps you interested.
B002VECLVO|1.0|Fashion mogul Tom Ford, in his film directing debut, turns Christopher Isherwood's sharp little \\"day in the life\\" novel into a \\"last day in the life\\" film. Isherwood's George goes about his day, a day like any other, filled with the thousand little indignities and annoyances that flesh is heir to. Annoying children from next door, condescending neighbors, (mostly) uncomprehending students in his literature class, etc. George's Englishness and his homosexuality give him an outsider's view on life in Los Angeles, and Isherwood acts as an invisible nameless narrator, supplying some good observation about George and his milieu. Isherwood's George isn't having the best day; he seems to be aware that he's just going through the motions, almost on auto-pilot, and it seems to have something to do with his recently deceased partner of 16 years, Jim.     In short, there isn't much plot in Isherwood's novel, and Ford can't be blamed for making George's seeming depression over the loss of his partner the focus of his film. Ford's George (played by Colin Firth, doing the best he can) is more than just bummed, he's actually preparing to kill himself. He leaves out the clothes he wants to be buried in, he prepares a series of Last Notes to assorted people, buys ammunition for the gun he keeps in his desk, and is shown throughout the day getting ready to check out once and for all.     Okay, well and good, not necessarily a bad notion in and of itself. The problem is Ford's need to make each scene, each shot, each bloody frame even, into a big display of every known cinematic technique, ranging from simple things like slow motion to the more advanced gimmick of manipulating the color saturation in the image to convey George's emotional state. One of the most tasteless moments in the film occurs in a bar when George is approached by a young man, cuing the color to go from muted but natural tones (George is Sad) to bright vibrant full color (George is Horny). It comes off less as aninstance of an interesting use of color than as an instance of Directorial Authority Run Amuck. Clearly, this film is an expression of STYLE over anything as mundane as mere Life. Ford can't bear to show any disorder in the world he brings to the screen, every image is faultlessly composed and immaculately lit, hermetically created for maximum glossy photo-spread effect. Even a display of plastic pencil sharpeners in college bookstore is carefully arranged, with the little plastic items arrayed in precise color-specific rows. A scene of George unable to pull the trigger of the gun he has in his mouth, evidently out of concern for the damage he'll do to his surroundings, at first comes off as just a spectcularly ill-advised bit of black comedy, but unexpectely winds up being emblematic of the entire film. Suicide is one thing, but mess will simply not be tolerated.     There's more. It isn't enough for George to strike up an impromptu chat with one of his neighbor's children, whom he has unexpectedly met at the bank. The little girl has to have a stylish entrance, glimpsed in the reflection of an impossibly over-polished floor, followed by a slow shot travelling up her body from bottom to top, with music clearly inspired by Bernard Herrmann's score to VERTIGO on the soundtrack, yet. The entire movie is nothing but this kind of flourish, over and over and over, little nudges from Ford so we can applaud how \\"cinematic\\" his film is. The nudges start to bruise, before long, and the urge to nudge back can't be denied. The film feels completely unnatural and mechanical, so composed and created and finally phony that AVATAR comes off as a gay lark tossed off as an afternoon's merry diversion in comparison. It is difficult to give a damn about anyone in the film when they're just a bunch of carefully pretty immaculately groomed and dressed (and undressed) puppets. That this is true of even George's relationship with the late Jim (played by the pretty but useless Matthew Goode, who last annoyed as Ozymandias in WATCHMEN) is a particularly grave failing. The flashbacks we get of George and Jim together (reading in cozy domesticity, or sitting in carefully composed and overly styled B/W Bruce Weber-esque splendor on a picturesque outcropping of rock) are pretty standard romance novel stuff. There's no accounting for soul mates, I guess, but I think I'd have preferred not seeing Jim at all to the overly posed scenes we get here, which seem to have been cribbed out of an upscale gay magazine all-male resort ad.     It all just thuds and plods along, with a ponderous funereal air that really gets oppressive. The film hasn't gotten the complaints that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN got, that it offers too negative a view of Homosexuality As Misery, but I doubt that A SINGLE MAN will get enough popular attention to warrant many complaints. I'm tempted to dismiss the film as TERMS OF ENDEARMENT for the Project Runway crowd. I have to admit that I was glad to see an actor of Colin Firth's abilities being allowed to carry a film, one at least nominally intended for grown ups. To be fair, Firth's scene where he gets the Awful Phone Call about Jim's passing is most impressive, by far the most memorable thing in the film. But even Firth's performance falls into the black hole of Ford's style, as closeup after closeup of George displaying Subtle Emotions become as cloying as the film they had, up until then, been the best part of.

B002JODV3S|4.0|Great overall production, overflowing with talent. If you're a Steve Vai fan, you'll love it. If you're new to Steve, it's a good intoduction to where he's coming from musically. My only complaint is that the Blu-ray doesn't have Blu-ray audio... (Dolby Tru HD, or DTS Master Audio). That said, the Dolby 5.1 sounds really good on my system, but lossless Blu-Ray audio is a major reason to choose the BD over DVD.

Yum, yum, yum all mine.  My husband can't have bananas and my son doesn't like nuts so these are all mine.  I think I'll make them buttered rum meltaways tomorrow.  Way to go, Martha.  I love this book.

B002YIHO7I|2.0|Sad to say but this album is an entirely sub-par effort from a group that should rightfully have been able to tower above any of today's \\"artists.\\"  But instead of getting three or four more classics to add to our Sade collection we get a mediocre set of blase tracks that lack any of the elements that originally made the band successful in the 80's... namely killer melodies, sophisticated instrumentation, and a smokey cool vibe.  Every song in Soldier Of Love plods along in a monochromatically dull and uninspired fashion almost as if the songwriter(s) had no original ideas to share.  In 2000 Lovers Rock at least had one worthwhile track, \\"By your side,\\" but this album has nothing that even come close.  Looking for smooth sax work by Stuart Mathhewman?  It's not here.  Looking for strong melodies that will stick in your head?  You'll have trouble humming any of these songs or even telling some of them apart.  Looking for insightful lyrics about love, life, and growth?  Forget about it, the songwriting is completely pedestrian.  Sade have officially lost the plot!  But I guess this is what happens to all artists when they get comfortable, lazy, amd start families... art suffers in the absence of hunger.

For anyone who wants to read the legendary work for themselves, \\"Origin of Species\\" is a fine update and well worth checking out.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie it had him against 3 villians tons of good action scenes, good story twist.(SPOILER ALERT) He fights against his friend Harry(new goblin) seeking revenge on his friend for murdering his father, the sandman (Flint Marko) who is a convict who escapes from prison for the murder of Ben Parker (Peters uncle) which is revealed that he was the one who killed his uncle instead of his partner and last but not least the evil alien symbiote Venom which it lands on earth and sneaks a ride on Peters scooter to invade his body and reveals Peters darkside but eventually Peter is able to fight the symbiote and remove it. It starts to take over Eddie Brock which he starts to use his new evil power to kill Peter for humiliating him. This spider man movie was really good but I wish they could of had venom more screen time. This upcoming reboot is a very stupid idea, I don't know why they are starting the series over, i really enjoyed this cast and all the sequels. Tobey Maguire was a perfect spider man. I don't know who they will pick again and what the plot and the villians will be. Lets boycott this reboot it doesn't need one.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|Finally!!! A whole generation will be able to go back to a time when the world felt smarter in many ways and when teenagers were the hope of the future rather than oversexed, immature, corporate packaged fad followers (Or maybe we were but the corporations had to be less obvious about it?). Ironically, MTV, the channel that originally broadcast this brilliant show about Daria and her witty friend Jane to a mostly likeminded audience have now begun to cater to, or some would say go out of their way to create and perpetuate, an immature drama addicted generation of Britneys and Kevins who only want shows like The Hills or Jersey Shore. Ah, look how far we've come.    This 8-Disc set contains all five seasons and both TV Movies:    Season 1    Esteemsters  The Invitation  College Bored  Cafe Disaffecto  Malled  This Year's Model  The Lab Brat  Pinch Sitter  Too Cute  The Big House  Road Worrier  The Teaching of Don Jake  The Misery Chick    Season 2    Arts n Crass  The Daria Hunter  Quinn The Brain  I Don't  That Was Then, This Is Dumb  Monster  The New Kid  Gifted  Ill  Fair Enough  See Jane Run  Pierce Me  Write Where It Hurts    Season 3    Daria!

That's 65 episodes and 2 TV Movies which adds up to 1606minutes, or over 26 hours, of Daria!    Special Features For The Set Are:    Original Pilot: Sealed With A Kick (10 Minutes Long)  Music Video: Mystik Spiral Music Video \\"Freakin' Friends\\"  Daria Day Intros  Top Ten Video Countdown Hosted by, who else, Daria & Jane  Cast & Crew Interviews!!!   Never Before Seen Mystik Spiral Spin-off Script      All in all this set is great for us fans who have waited so long, even if it can't live up to being entirely worth the wait. Firstly, I am thankful that they released the entire series at once so we never had to worry about poor sales or stupid executives only allowing partial release of the series. Secondly, I did enjoy the special features but wish they'd had more, maybe some commentaries, to make up for the absence of proper music. There is also a paper inside the set telling us, in Daria fashion, to be happy we got the set at all and I found it funny and in tone with the show. That said it would have been nice to have a proper booklet with episode summaries and show facts to go along with it.    Watching the show with the music changes I will say it's still a funny and enjoyable show, but even to those who say they didn't pay much attention to the music, I think you'll still sense an absence. It's not enough to ruin my enjoyment of this great series but I can best describe it by saying when I watch the show without proper music it feels as though one of the main characters is missing. I still enjoy it but in the back of my mind I keep wondering when and if that main character will return. At any rate getting the complete series with a few special features for this price is more than worth it.     To sum up this show is great regardless but it does suck that songs inevitably had to be changed and left out since the late 90's and early millenium music is a character of the show. I personally say five stars for this series but I have to give this set 4 stars because I do miss the music and wish there had at least been somemore in depth special features to make up for it or even a book with proper episode listings. Still, this is a great buy for any Daria fans - just remember to only get as excited about it as you imagine Daria would have been and you should be fine.    *Kind of upset that the Looking Back In Annoyance Special wasn't included on this set yet the Jane and Daria Top Ten Countdown was. Oh well, still 4 stars from me.

B000002AZ8|4.0|'Vitalogy' is probably a bit too inconsistent to be Pearl Jam's best album, but in my opinion it is their most important. It captures the group in transition from their grungy roots to their more experimental later work, and so it provides a snapshot of everything Pearl Jam were about. There's really something for everyone on this album; enough post-grunge rockers to please fans of 'Ten', but also plenty of pointers to the more ambitious 'No Code' and 'Binaural'.     The album is front-loaded to an extent, with most of the older-school Pearl Jam songs appearing in the first half; 'Last Exit', 'Not For You', 'Tremor Christ', 'Corduroy'. There are also some more introspective pieces such as 'Nothingman', 'Better Man' and 'Immortality'. Elsewhere, Pearl Jam branch out significantly; the frenetic punk of 'Spin The Black Circle', the funky mantra-like 'Aye Davanita', the Tom-Waits-meets-Weird-Al-Yankovic of 'Bugs', and the closer 'Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me', which wouldn't be out of place on a 60's avante-garde record.     Despite the diversity, most of the songs are memorable and catchy. Pearl Jam certainly haven't sacrificed big riffs and melodies, and it's actually a bit surprising that it didn't throw off more successful singles. 'Better Man' was a big hit, but I'd have thought 'Corduroy', 'Nothingman', 'Last Exit', 'Not For You', 'Spin The Black Circle' and 'Tremor Christ' would have become FM staples too.     Note that the production on 'Vitalogy' is quite dry and sparse compared to other Pearl Jam releases, giving the album a very direct and immediate feel. This works well in two ways; it gives the more straightforward songs a heavier kick (musically and lyrically), and also helps highlight just how experimental some of the ambitious tracks are. A heavy, glossy production wouldn't have done that.     Not everything works as well as it could. I never really got the point of 'Bugs', while 'Hey...' drags on a bit too long. But for the most part this album holds together really well. Perhaps they could have changed the sequencing to mix up the accessible and experimental songs a bit better (I imagine 'Ten' fans listening to the first five songs then skipping through the second half), but that's a minor criticism. Pearl Jam are brave enough to spread their wings and talented enough to (mostly) pull it off. And that's a great achievement.
B002WY65VU|5.0|What is with zombies that people get attracted to them? George Romero made a career because if them, and even Michael Jackson jumped into the wagon. So it was matter of time before a funny and original - if there is such thing with zombies - movie about the living dead would make it to the big screen. \\"Zombieland\\" will certainly give you that, and, provided that you can stand a good dose of guts and blood, you'll have a great time.    Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) appears to be the only survivor in a world in which a deadly virus wiped out mankind. He describes the country as \\"The United States of Zombieland,\\" because the virus transformed people into zombies that will kill and eat any human that they come across with. We find Columbus wondering in a Texan town, trying to find his way to his hometown in Columbus, Ohio, so that he can find out his parents' fate. For this purpose he has developed a series of techniques to survive zombies, including \\"cardio\\", \\"seatbealts\\", \\"double tap,\\" and others (you need to see the film to understand this terminology). On his way to Ohio, he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a tough-looking character, who has also been able to survive the infection, and who would kill for a Twinkie. Along the way, they unwillingly hook up with Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), two no-nonsense, experienced girls that have also been able to stay human. Together, as you might expect, they find and fight more zombies, meet Bill Murray (in a surprising and weird appearance), and even find time for love.    \\"Zombieland\\" has as much gore as you can imagine, but it provides for good fun. After so many movies that you might think are directed to sick, perverse minds - I can't believe that there is an audience for this-, it is healthy that somebody took a comedic look at it. And that's all we want. The DVD includes deleted scenes; commentaries by Harrelson, Eisenberg, director Ruben Fleischer, and writers Rhett Resse and Paul Wernick; making-of documentary; and more.

B00337KM2S|2.0|\\"Up in the Air\\" is primarily a long advertisement for American Airlines, Hertz Rent-A-Car, and Hilton Hotels. It also wasn't funny watching a sophomoric approach to firing people - especially by gutless managers that couldn't do it themselves. (I've never heard of that in reality.) Finally, the movie would have been more credible if George Clooney had been fired in the end, after his associates' \\"Go To Meeting\\" Internet no-travel approach had been institutionalized. At least she had the sense to move on with her life, leaving Clooney to return to being a lonely drag on society. I can't believe this movie is being considered for an award!
B001C08RHA|5.0|I am not the biggest fan of action movies, although my husband is slowly turning me around to being open-minded about them. This one is funny and has a great cast. The story is not complicated but sophisticated enough for an adult to get involved. The actions scenes are great and Bob Downey Jr is really a wonderful actor. Props to Terrence Howard and Gweneth Paltrow too!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I bought it just before the movie came out.  I waited to finish the book before I saw the movie and I am glad I did.  The book is GREAT!  The movie was so far off the book, it was hard for me to watch.  I wish the movie would have stayed more true to the book.  There is nothing more aggravating for me than a great book that is butchered by the movie.

I am glad that he inserted some lighthearted humor alongside some of the most heartbreaking stories of people struggling to live their lives with the broken system that we have.

1580176941|5.0|As an avid baker I am thrilled to have found this book! I won't repeat the other fabulous reviews (of which I predominantly agree), but I will say that the dough recipes, information about how to roll out and chill the dough between paper parchment sheets, and the gorgeous photos/details to inspire the most reluctant baker are more than worth the price of this book!<br /><br />That said, I have three minor issues with the book:<br /><br />1) The authors don't mention bringing the cut cookies to room temperature before baking (unless I missed that part of the book). That allows the cookies to rise as much as possible. When I didn't do that with two batches, the cookies were denser and harder upon drying.<br /><br />2) The royal icing flood recipe using powdered egg white produced icing that was WAY too runny. I used half of the water in a subsequent batch and it came out better. I prefer the Wilton website royal icing or color flow icing recipes. Note: Color flow produces icing that dries shinier than royal icing.<br /><br />3) Parchment paper is incredibly expensive if you buy it on the roll...so a quick Google search produced several sites that sold them by the sheets. The authors briefly mention precut parchment sheets in the book; I think that they are indispensable now that I've used them. I was previously devoted to my four Silpat mats but have since retired them. The Webstaurantstore website produced the best value - I purchased 1,000 16 x 24 Quilon parchment sheets (enough for several years of frequent baking), 1 dozen small plastic squeeze bottles with caps, 3 sizes of Vollrath silicone spatulas, baker's hats (for my kids), and aprons for each of us for a relatively nominal fee. The parchment sheets alone were an amazing find! I fold them in half to roll out the dough between the two halves then run a knife along the folded edge to use 1/2 on each of my two 12 x 16 baking pans.<br /><br />For environmental reasons I didn't use the authors' suggestion of using a plastic disposable table cloth. My kids (ages 10-13) made a bit of a mess during our several decorating sessions but it wasn't anything that a few wet sponges or towels couldn't take care of. Decorating with younger kids may need more preventative strategies. ;-) I used paper plates and/or cafeteria-like trays with my kids when they were younger.<br /><br />One last note: I tried baking a single sheet of cookies in the middle of the oven and compared it to using two baking sheets spaced evenly in the oven (rotating them halfway through baking as the authors describe). While the single sheet did come out a bit better, it was only marginally better. If you need cookies that are done precisely, then a single batch is better. If you can live with a bit of variability, baking two simultaneously won't dramatically alter the finished product.<br /><br />Happy Baking!!!y kids (ages 10-13) made a bit of a mess during our several decorating sessions but it wasn't anything that a few wet sponges or towels couldn't take care of.

B00337KM2S|3.0|It's useless to state this year will not been reminded precisely as a fruitful one in which concerns the movies that have been nominated for the Academy awards. Moreover, if you take a glimpse around the last sixty years, you will be notice how modest has been this season in which the originality and creativity glitter for their absence.<br /><br />The personal record of this executive has been reached: Ten millions miles in the air. But beneath the curious anecdote, there's a lonely man who has wrought a peculiar life philosophy: to live without hindrances or emotional ties.<br /><br />Meanwhile, three facts will make its appearance in order to alterate his habitual way of life: he will meet another female executive who lives a similar life, on the other hand, a young woman tries to follow his steps as executive (but fails in her attempt) and besides, his own sister is going to be married and he is invited for her wedding.<br /><br />The emotional impact of this marriage will make think and reflect about his existential profile, far beyond all the successes and achieved goal.<br /><br />Two previous films have remarked and inspired this one: Lost in Tokyo and Amelie.<br /><br />In sum, a dramatic comedy that in honor to the truth has been overrated, due the proposed idea promised much more. To be honest, the film doesn't match the status to be nominated as Best Film.<br /><br />It's a pleasant movie but nothing else.
B00009Z576|5.0|It doesn't really sound like Yes, but it's sure not The Buggles either.  It's unlike any other Yes album, but that's somewhat true of all Yes albums.

B002YIHO7I|4.0|The mere fact that Soldier of Love is Sade's first album in nearly a decade demanded my attention.  Add in the mostly very positive reviews (ex., A- from EW, A from Mojo), and it promises to be a real treat for Sade fans.  The album starts really strong, with an elegantly melancholic song called \\"The Moon and the Sky,\\" featuring a deluxe yet understated arrangement and backing from the Sweetback guys (her band).  Then comes the highlight of Soldier, the excellent title track with its martial rhythms and aggro electric guitar riffs.  (The video for the tune is good too, a striking piece of art, although it seems ripe for parody.)  From there, the album slowly slides into some kind of a lovely trance state.  The songs are nearly all down-tempo ballads, to the point of near drowsiness, but Ms Adu's silky vocals and the smooth backing band give it all a sheen of beauty and light.  Beyond the title track nothing really stood out for me, but if you like hearing Sade sing - and I really do - these songs are well suited to showcase her singing style.  I kept thinking of the phrase \\"languid and bittersweet\\" from Steely Dan; I think that's a good description of Sade's music.  By the way, if you want to challenge my description of the sleepy quality of these songs, try listening to just these two songs back to back, by themselves - \\"Long Hard Road\\" and \\"Be That Easy\\" - and just see if your mind doesn't begin to drift off a bit.  It's a good kind of sleepiness, though - I'm not complaining!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I really liked this movie, though I found it not to be in the full essence of the Sherlock Holmes novels I read in high school.  Guy Ritchie's version is highly vamped up, raw and a bit edgy.  Jude Law's and Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayals of their respective literary counterparts are super action hero like which make the the film a bit silly if you grew up reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original versions or saw the early 1930s, 1940s and 1950s (very subdued) cinematic versions with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.<br /><br />Still, it was a fun movie and Jude Law and Robery Downey Jr. have a chemistry together that I have not seen matched in a very long time!  Overall, this is definitely worth seeing/buying if you are ok with this \\"new agey\\" take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's super sleuth.  If you are a traditional Sherlock Holmes snob or an old school English teacher... beware! lol

B001AQUR7O|5.0|This truly is the best of the wonderful Nigerian songstress. This is the one you put on when you just want to listen to Sade. There is an amazingly smooth flow to this collection. You never want to skip around as you would on another artist's \\"Best Of\\" effort because you would miss a great song. The exotic blend of the band's rhythms and the smooth stylings of Sade Adu come together to form a unique musical experience like no other.<br /><br />First came the jazz flavored \\"Diamond Life.\\" \\"Smooth Operator\\" burst from the radio like a tidal wave, her fresh, clean sound washing over us and immediately garnering millions of loyal fans who couldn't wait for the next release.<br /><br />Blue was the color Sade's second album, \\"Promise.\\" Her music has always been an eclectic mix of light jazz and blues, and in her follow up to the more jazz oriented \\"Diamond Life\\" she colored this one with the blues. Fast and rhythmic tunes such as \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\" were mixed in with the blues like a sudden rain shower.<br /><br />Sade and her band gave \\"Stronger Than Pride\\" a lighter tone than the bluesy \\"Promise\\" which preceded it. It had the feel of sandy shores at twilight and the nightlife of palm trees and exotic drinks with flowers in them. It was a lush but spare production of rythms and vocals blending perfectly to create a special atmosphere. No matter where you were, or what you were doing, once it was playing you were somewhere else. And it was a good place to be. Songs like \\"Stronger Than Pride\\" and \\"Paradise\\" conjured thoughts of exotic beaches and sandy shores.<br /><br />Love Deluxe was Sade's concept album on love. It was filled with the euphoria of loving and being loved romantically. Even the love of a mother desperately trying to feed her daughter was touched upon. Soulful and deeply moving efforts like \\"Pearls\\" and \\"Like a Tattoo\\" alternated between sensual and happy songs such as \\"Kiss of Life\\" and \\"Cherish the Day\\" It was a magical CD that you never tired of listening to.<br /><br />Sade would be absent for a long time after this was released, with only this \\"Best Of Sade\\" released before she returned several years later. Maybe only she knew how long it would be this time and decided to leave something wonderous to tide us over. This collection is soothing and beautiful, the vocals artistry in motion. Sade reaches into her soul and lays bare both the joy and misery love can bring upon us.<br /><br />This is an exquisite CD with almost a spiritual feel to it. Sade's fans are loving and loyal and that feeling has always been returned from Sade. This is everything that is good about music, a rich and rewarding journey into the heart. In a career filled with wonderful moments, these are some of her finest. Don't miss this basket of potpouri given as a gift from the lovely, talented Sade Adu.

B001JQTSG6|4.0|Martin Scorsese is unquestionably a great director, and this is a fine film. I used to think it was a great film, but since the last time I watched, I've seen \\"GoodFellas\\". And the latter casts a bad light on the former. Hang on as I try to explain.<br /><br />\\"GoodFellas\\" has an iconic scene, largely improvised, in which Joe Pesci's paranoid-psychotic character takes objection to another mobster's innocent comment that he finds Pesci \\"funny\\". Pesci pesters him about this -- \\"What do you mean, I'm funny?\\" -- amping up the lethal tension until it's suddenly released, for no obvious reason. We don't know why Pesci is acting the way he does. But we are very much aware that we're watching stupid, illiterate, insane people argue for no good reason. And it works.<br /><br />In crafting a biography of Jake LaMotta (who, as I write this, is still alive at the age of 89), Scorsese tried to get away from the clich&eacute;s of Hollywood bopics, and succeeded. There are no portentous scenes, no \\"we have to sum up everthing that happened up to now\\" dialog. The film seems almost documentary, as if we're watching the events unfold in real time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in order to get this casual, unpretentious effect, Scorsese had the actors ad-lib some of the dialog -- and it just doesn't work, particularly in scenes where one character confronts another. It's hard enough for a screenwriter to pen high-quality dialog -- it's almost impossible for any actor to come up with merely /appropriate/ dialog on the spur of the moment.<br /><br />\\"Did you f*** my wife?\\" \\"What do you mean by that?\\" \\"I mean, did you f*** my wife?\\" \\"I ain't gonna answer that.\\" \\"You're my brother, I expect you to.\\" \\"That's a crazy question, I ain't gonna answer.\\" And so on, and so on, until you want to throttle both the characters and the actors playing them. As bad as it sounds \\"on paper\\", it's many times worse in the film.<br /><br />And it doesn't happen just once, but in scene after scene, until it becomes an irritation. It seemed novel in 1980, but in 2010 it's a clich&eacute;. Scorsese should have used the ad-libs as a starting point and written \\"believable\\" dialog that came closer to the way the characters would likely have spoken in real life. (He could have gotten LaMotta's view, as he was an advisor.) As it is, we're not seeing the charactrers, but the actor ad-libbing.<br /><br />This is the only reason I dislike \\"Raging Bull\\". It is otherwise a magnificent movie, with beautiful B&W cinematography that anyone who says \\"I don't like B&W films\\" has to see. If you're not bothered by (in my view) the poor improvised dialog, you will doubtless find it a masterpiece.in 2010 it's a cliché.

I found his approach totally absorbing. As well researched, well written and entertaining as popular history gets. It is well worth ordering the UK edition unless you can confirm if this will be published in the US soon.<br />Churchill's faults are not overlooked but his accomplishments are given full credit as well. He is presented here as the right man for the challenges faced by a Britain at war and who can really argue with that. Hastings reminds us that early in the war the forces of appeasement were very strong and Churchill's rhetoric did much to force an ultimate outcome that could not have been foreseen at the outset. Rich in anecdotes as well as evidence this book really gives the reader the sense that you are in the room during some of the historically significant discussions and moments that Churchill participated in during the war.<br />Hastings concluding chapter and his summary of Churchill's place in history is required reading. It represents a valuable and balanced summary of his achievements and contributions.
0810983915|5.0|This book and the whole series is a blast to read. I takes me back to my youth and experiences in school. I think it is a blast to read.
0553573411|5.0|It took me a while after reading George RR Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" (thus far) to find another fantasy series that measured up.  Now after completing \\"Royal Assassin\\" I feel confident in saying that Robin Hobb has more than lived up to the task.    I don't consider myself a qualified judge as to what makes fine literature, aside from its ability to entertain and inspire emotion.  I don't really analyze writing style, I often miss metaphors and alliteration, and my knowledge of the \\"classics\\" is limitted at best.  What I can say is, no one since GRRM has grabbed my attention and strung me along the way Hobb does.  No character in literature has ever made me feel such a vested interest in their well-being as Fitz.  These books make me angry, sad, excited, fearful...basically every emotion that a figment of someone else's imagination can possible imbue.    In order for this series to not become my favorite, book 3 would have to take a massive step backward.  So far I wouldn't change a thing.
0316017922|5.0|Fascinating! It really puts the spotlight on critical reasons for success, whereby it's not just hard work and skill, but often \\"right place, right time\\". Thoroughly recommended.
0385737947|5.0|*Possible Spoilers*    I actually just finished the book this morning. Enough time for the book to digest. The Maze Runner Is an amazing book. I can feel ounce for ounce with Thomas. I was talking about the book earlier with a friends, i suggested that she read it, she's said something about it not being her style, then asked me if there was any romance in it, shes a big romance reader,. Not sure if you can call it \\"romance\\" after all it is an odd 50 guys and then 1 girl comes alojng. But its clear from the writing that Thomas and Teresa have a connection. My reply then was kinda, but then i said she prob wouldn't like it because she doesn't like the dystopian apocalypse theme.    So i recommend it to anybody with a desire for a good book. It was pretty short though so you might watn another book with it. If only we had a sequel.    My Recommendation:  Buy it, It is worth it 100% of the way. The action will not let you put the book down and there isn't enough drama to bog you down between it.
B0029LHX1W|5.0|This is a great debut novel. It is well researched, I liked how the author wove actual Soviet history into the story.<br /><br />Yes, people were actually forced to live their lives like this. The story is believable and real amidst all this chaos.  Life was strange in this country where the leader, Stalin, said that no one could be trusted. Wrong!<br /><br />The story becomes an unexpected story of love and hope.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|After the embarrassing release of the 2 disc Criterion Collection Directors Cut (they spent all their time putting every possible documentary on there that they forgot the most basic and essential feature which is to format the discs for an anamorphic output on 16x9 screens.)  That's almost as embarassing as releasing \\"Waterworld\\" on Blu-ray but only putting the extended version on the DVD.  For Armageddon, they need to put everything on this disc as well but be sure to proof edit cause this is too good a movie to screw up.

0670021652|4.0|I finished this book in pretty much one go. The subject is interesting and the material well composed. She's witty as before and kept a keen eye on her surroundings, both physical and emotional. And I share many of the same thoughts as the author on the theme of marriage, love and being-a-woman-in-this-day-and-age. Glad to see I'm not alone and certainly there are people (smart ones too!) share these views.    Having said that, I must admit I could not get over the fact that she used the term 'moreover' 5 times a page. There are also passages that are repetitive and scattered. Where is the good editor when you need one? Hope it's not because she had to rush the book out so that nobody else read it before the final print!
0375413405|5.0|This is a great book! I especially appreciate the basic guidance on meat cuts, pots and other cooking tips in easy to understand verbiage. I find myself wanting to cook with creamy butter more often. :) And I generally find I am learning more about cooking techniques in general whether or not following a specific receipe. I did  however, recently complete my first recipe from this book - Beef Bourguignon.<br /><br />Well...I decided I had procrastinated long enough and set out to make Beef Bourguignon as the Big Blizzard of 2010 (the first one on 2/6 - not the second that is on the way here now on 2/8...<br />:-0!) and the Super Bowl swept down upon us here in Virginia and metro D.C. area. I had been putting it off because I have never been very confident in following recipes - especially not those where making my own marinade (with wine), and several steps of sauteeing, browning, tossing etc. were in the directions. In a word...I was terrified. My recent bravery was induced by the fact that backup crab cakes had been purchased at Whole Foods on Friday before the snow really got started. (Hard to mess up crab cakes...) These went into the freezer in case of disaster with the Beef Bourguignon. I had never even made a beef stew before though I love to eat it when its cold outside - even though I am not a big beef eater - not at all. Anyway...the thing is...I followed the recipe pretty closely. Julia gives little tips on how to embellish and recover from small errors which helped when the sauce was thinner than I thought it should be. The Beef Bourguignon turned out absolutely DIVINE!! And that is saying a lot because believe me - I was SURE it would come out too bland or worse - just unpalatable. I mean - I have never cooked with that much wine and the spice and flavoring combinations weren't all familiar to me. In any case - I stayed pretty much on target with the recipe and OMG! It was SO delicious!! I didn't know I had it in me! It was perfect to eat while watching the Saints win their first ever Super Bowl.<br />:-)<br /><br />Great book - even for an average cook like me!<br />Bon Apetit! :-Ds win their first ever Super Bowl.   :-)     Great book - even for an average cook like me!   Bon Apetit! :-D

B000002IP1|4.0|I have heard a couple of Phil Collins albums that came before this, the 'Face Value' album, which is good, but not consistent, and the very patchy 'hello, I must be going'. This is, for the most part, much more melodic. I particularly like 'that's just the way it is', very nice harmony vocals by Crosby, and 'colours' has a beautiful opening section and a memorable next part, one of the best songs of his career, that is really long, but doesn't feel like that.   'Another day in paradise' is a fantastic, meaningful song with touching lyrics and a good harmony vocal again from Crosby. 'Father and son' is a touching ballad, one of the best songs he has done.  Recommended.
0670021652|4.0|I would recommend this selection to anyone also who read Eat, Pray, Love.  I read it over my 25th wedding anniversary and decided 25 more years would be great!!!!
B00288KNJU|5.0|Film (of it's kind) of all time. So much better than The Nightmare Before Christmas. To be honest that movie is kind of overrated. But this one has such a great story line and the colors and animation are fantastic. Plus it looks even better when you watch it in 3D which this includes. It even includes 4 pairs of 3D glasses. You won't be sorry when you buy this movie. It is kind of a creepy movie so I wouldn't recommend little kids watching this movie.
0446567329|4.0|Dear John is an excellent book and well written. I've never read a book by Sparks, but I can safely say that I am a fan. It was a page turner and left you eager to find out what happens next between Savannah and John. I read 145 pages in one day. I'm so glad I read this book. I feel that it really demonstrates what true love is. I've never had the desire to see a movie so bad until I saw the trailer. I hope the movie does this book justice. This book was well worth my money. I hate buying a book and it be a total bore. Hope my review helps. :)
B0011UF79C|5.0|Most Science Fiction seen in movies is actually Fantasy and Romantic fiction given a very thin gloss of scientific speculation. This is a completely different affair. Based in scientific speculation only a few decades beyond our current capabilities, Gattacca makes a concerted effort to discuss and understand how scientific advancement will effect our society. Added to that is a wonderful story, detailed and believable characters, and enough suspense for any film. As a true expression of what Hard Science Fiction, in the vein of Clarke of Asimov, is supposed to be I can not suggest a better film.
B000ZELISO|5.0|It´s one of the most fantastic movies of Harry Potter. Seeing it in BluRay it´s a fantastic experience. High definition and an incredible sound!!
006621131X|5.0|Patti Smith was broke and hungry when she met Robert Mapplethorpe, high on LSD, at a park in the summer of 1967. Smith would become the \\"Godmother of Punk\\" and the rebel poet and rocker. Mapplethorpe would become a world-famous, often hated,  photographer of sadomasochistic images and self-portraits with bull-whips.<br /><br /> Almost immediately the two became lovers and the closest of friends. Smith writes, \\"we had mutually surrendered our loneliness and replaced it with trust.\\" They went through poverty, obscurity, drugs, fame and the AIDS that would kill Mapplethorpe.<br /><br />When Smith was a young girl, the sight of a swan produced a transcendent moment of being: \\"The swan became one with the sky . . . and I felt a twinge, a curious yearning, imperceptible to passersby, my mother, the trees, or the clouds.\\" This is the way Smith would think and why she was so good at what she did.<br /><br />This is a real human love story and certainly worth reading -- especially for those of us who were young and eager to change the world in those days.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />- Susanna K. Hutcheson
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|Thanks god season 6 is beggining right now!! I have a lot of question and this never finish answer me... It´s incredible all the features that BluRay gives... It has a lot of new releases in entertaiment... I would never be so proud of my purchase...
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Sade is back. She has always had a sensual quality to her music.  This album continues that trend.  She has a excellent band of musicians that enhance the music on this disc.  Stuart Matthewman plays a smooth sax.  Ian Burdge plays the somber cello. Juan Janes plays the romantic guitar on one track.  All three musicians contribute their talents to make this Sade's best effort in years.  I love this new disc.  My favorite track is the title cut.  I love the tight beat of the drums on this track.  This song lifts my spirit. \\"In Another Time\\" is my other favorite track  here.  It is a song with lovely musical arrangements. I can feel the purity in her voice here. I love the piano playing and saxophone featured on this track. \\"Babyfather\\" leaves me feeling very calm. It has a nice regaae sound.  \\"The Safest Place\\" is a very romantic song. The cello playing is beautiful on this track. \\"The Moon And The Sky\\" is a lovely song about trying to cling to a relationship.  \\"Long Hard Road\\" is a reminder for me to never give up.  The guitar playing sounds pretty here.  \\"Be That Easy\\" is a song that puts my mind at ease. This song is very soothing.  I love this new music from Sade.
B001QOGYFO|3.0|First of all, I should say that Alex O'Loughlin is the main reason I wanted to see this movie.  I am a huge fan of his from Moonlight enough to want to see other projects he's doing.  The fact that Kate Beckinsale is in this movie is another bonus.  I love her in the Underworld movies.  I just wish Alex would have played a bigger part in the movie.  Although hearing him use his true accent was a bonus.<br /><br />The movie is not one of my favorites; my favorites leave me saying wow at the end and still trying to sort through some key details after the movie is over.  It is a simple plot that Kate's character unravels rather quickly, but it does leave you wondering which one of the characters is going to turn out to be the villian in the end.  This is probably one of the biggest mysteries of the movie.  The writer does a good job of pointing you in several directions, using the main character's uncertainty from her past, and leaving you wondering which character is trustworthy enough to be her trusted companion clear to the end.  Then there is still a nifty little twist.<br /><br />DVD is the way to go with this movie.
B002XTBE6K|3.0|Having read the novel and watched both the Gwyneth Paltrow version and the Kate Beckinsale version, I must say that this BBC version is the most dissapointing of the bunch. I am an avid Period Piece lover and was simply over the moon when I heard this was coming out. Again, what a dissapointment!    The movie looks lovely and picturesque with great locations, props and architecture. The soundtrack is also pleasant and fits really well. The problem lies entirely with the portrayal of the characters. Almost every last one had me cringing at times.     To start: I have always pictured Emma as put together, collected, well spoken and for the most part, well-mannered. This version's Emma came off as immature at times, as well as goofy and appearance-wise- almost frumpy in certain scenes. Some of the costumes seemed ill-fitted which doesn't suit the character of Emma at all. Her actions and behavior came off a bit modernized and out of place.    Next, Mr Knightly, who should have been the epitome of suave and sophistication-instead looked stiff, unsure and almost out of place at times. Even as he scolded Emma, it was without the proper passion that could easily be felt from reading the book or even watching the great Jeremy Northam. Very dissapointed by his portrayal.    Mrs. Weston, I have always envisioned as almost regal, genteel and astute. But here, she comes off as a smiley, goofy lady who barely has any influence over Emma. I found her to be very odd here.    Frank Churchill was rude and pompous moreso than I ever imagined him to be and quite annoying. While hiding his love for Jane Fairfax, he goes off and completely insults and makes fun of her? The complete opposite of a gentleman who should have been brought up much better than that. Again, his character was not at all how I perceived him to be.    Speaking of J. Fairfax: Skittish, awkward and constantly wide-eyed here. Did not like her character at all.    I could list every single character's faults but as this would take forever, I shall stop with the main players. I know everyone has their opinion, but as an avid Jane Austen lover, I was deeply confused by the odd portrayals and again, dissapointed by the whole thing.    This isn't a bad adaptation, just a more modernized take, which isn't to my liking. For me, the 1996 feature version will remain my favorite and most accurate.
B002XTBE6K|3.0|I recently watched this series on PBS's Masterpiece Classics.  I was reasonably entertained but did not enjoy this production as much as the 1996 film starring Gwyneth Paltrow ([[ASIN:B00000G3AZ Emma]]) which is, by far, the best.<br /><br />I really wanted to like Romola Garai as Emma.  She's very pretty but, as someone else mentioned, her eyes tend to bug out a little to often for someone who is supposed to be a genteel young lady and her mouth is always hanging open, which I found distracting.  Also, some of the choices that she (or possibly the director) made did not suit the part she was playing.  Overall, I thought she was very sweet and charming but lacked the refinement needed for this role.<br /><br />I really disliked the portrayal of Mr. Woodhouse.  Instead of being the lovable worrywart, he was just a depressed old man who seemed to take no pleasure in anything.  I thought Mr. Knightly was fairly well done by Johnny Lee Miller but still no comparison to Jeremy Northam, who was the ultimate gentleman.  The rest of the characters were reasonably cast, if not exactly perfect.  This film's Miss Bates seemed to be copy-catting Sophie Thompson's portrayal of the same character.<br /><br />The worst part is that they changed much of the dialogue, which I can't understand, because it stands well enough on its own merit.  They took something which could have been very good and made a so-so production.  It was entertaining enough to watch on TV but I definitely will not be purchasing this series.  I'll stick with Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This HBO miniseries documents the adventures of a Marine platoon during the first phase of the Iraq War in 2003 as they rumble around the desert in unarmored humvees looking for the bad guys.  The large cast and the density of military jargon in the dialogue can make the story difficult to follow for civilians like me, but the resulting texture and authenticity more than makes up for it.  A rather clear picture of the muddled tactical situation and the platoon's variety of reactions to it gradually emerges, and repeated viewings are bound to reveal additional insights.  This exceptional film mostly eschews politics in the interest of showing us what the war looks like from the front lines.    The entire cast is outstanding, but special mention goes to the actors who portray the crew of Bravo Company's lead vehicle, who come closest to being the stars of the show.  Alexander Skarsgard (who should have been cast in the upcoming Thor movie) portrays the cool, dependable Brad \\"Iceman\\" Colbert.  James Ransome is Corporal Josh Ray Person, the mouth-mouthed driver who has some really funny monologues.  Billy Lush is the chillingly dim-witted Lance Corporal Trombley, who gets off on the violence.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|In a word, GreAwesoAmazIncrediBrilliant! Note that I am a fan of Mraz. And by fan I mean I buy his albums so this review may seem favorable but I'm always totally honest. This concert DVD was a Wonderful ride through Mraz's musical brilliance. He came with his musician friends to share with his fan friends and what a 'Show and Tell' it was. His total comfort presenting his art submerges you in the festive fun as his vocal talent and the bands impressive energy transports you to a musical euphoria. This is my first of Jason Mraz's concert DVDs. I've watched clips of his other concerts on streaming video and I feel this one has the most movie-like appeal, a direction I'm sure he was trying to go in with this project. I could be wrong, but because of my total satisfaction with this DVD, I will find out as I begin purchasing his older recorded works. In conclusion, I recommend this video. 5 Stars for me.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|Sade (the singer and band) has finally returned to the realm of music, much to the delight of fans and artists. A return that is sure to be very welcomed and much appreciated by all.  For the purpose of this review I'll just refer to Sade the singer.  Sade is a legend and somewhat of an enigma.  Seeing and hearing Sade is a rare occurrence even though we hear her songs all the time in stores, on the radio, sampled, in movies etc.  That's why its kind of hard to believe she hasn't released an album in over a decade.  There haven't been any random songs, teasers, features or appearances.  There's been no interviews, award show appearances, tours (at least that I know of) either.  Just a disappearance from everything, she hadn't even been spotted shopping or anything.      Around the return of Maxwell, last year, there was chatter of a return of Sade Adu to the music world as well.  I, personally, all but dismissed that notion up until I was on a blog and they confirmed a released date.  I had to pinch myself because I didn't know if this was really happening.  I mean, Sade???  How do you just come with an album out of literally nowhere?  Needless to say anticipation grew everywhere.  I mean who doesn't listen to Sade?  Even the hardest thugs have a soft spot for Ms. Adu.      Nonetheless, the album is here.  The lead single and title track Soldier of Love was nothing short of fantastic.  With it's edgy tone and killer melody, Sade proved that she definitely still had it.  She had successfully updated her sound yet it was still the same classic SADE voice and grooves that fans have come to expect and grown to absolutely love.  However, the 10 track album fails to live up to the unattainable expectations for it.    As other reviewers have stated the album is a little heavy on the molasses.  If you're not familiar with molasses, then a better statement would be that the album moves along at a slow pace.  The groovy sexiness of say Cherish The Day or I Couldn't Love You More; the energy of say Cherry Pie or Hang On To Your Love; and even the thick soul of Bulletproof Soul or King Of Sorrow is just simply not present on the album.  Instead the album is full of songs in the same vein as Pearls or Jezebel as far as tempo.    Now don't get me wrong I'm not comparing this album to her others, I'm just trying to give a point of reference as to what the songs sound like.  Personally, I enjoy Sade more when she is breezing through songs with melody and groove (Paradise, Somebody Already Broke My Heart, etc.).  Her pace is just a little bit too slow for me on Soldier of Love.        With the tone of this review it would seem as though I don't like the album and that's not true.  There are some amazing songs on here.  The aforementioned Soldier of Love is an instant classic.  In Another Time carries on beautifully and we get a hint of jazz (that's not present anywhere else on the album and sorely missing).  Skin, Babyfather and The Moon & The Sky also prove worthy of inclusion.  The rest of the songs are good too they just move along at a snail's pace.    Overall, Sade has returned to music.  Her voice is still as smooth and sweet as ever.  The lyrics remain poignant and classy.  The music itself isn't as engaging and is the only element that causes the cd to suffer.  Sade fans should enjoy the album even if it is somewhat of a departure from her \\"signature sound\\".  Hopefully we won't have to wait another 10 years to enjoy some more music from the legendary Sade.  Soldier of Love is not as great as it should be but it's a good album. 3.5 stars.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|It's not a good thing when the cast outside of the leads outshine and overtake the main event. The two leads are like listening to chalk on a blackboard for two obnoxious hours. The old codger is the cranky fuddy duddy you would shy from checking the mail if he was in the front yard next to yours. I don't want to hear it. The wilderness explorer kid is a slap in the face contrivance to the boy scouts of America that they are a herd of cutsie wootsie beings trying to be a flame of gosh golly gee goodness. Wrong. Boy scouts are a serious bunch of explorers that surround themselves in fun with what they are doing. Learning to be a better American, and not a bothersome kid. The dogs should have taken over production as the short animation extra, Special Mission, proves they were more adorable, original, and could hold their own turf away from the dreary humans. Even the extra Partly Cloudy was a milestone in comparison to the main feature. I mean what is with these features. The artists conjure up some finally drawn character, give them some rather cliche typecast traits and expect the audience to fall in love. Like when the old man tearfully browsed through an old photo album with emotional piano score, I was thinking, the audience never got to know his sweetheart other than the goofy intro to the movie. I fastforwrded that part on the DVD, thank goodness, it was giving me the creeps.
B00319ECHE|5.0|Let me first say that this is an absolute most own but I put a very big [...] on that...Rather than whine and [...] about the legal implications of the Fear Factory brand (to me it will always need to have Herrera, Bell and Cazares) let me say regardless of whatever name they go under- this is still a very tight & heavy record. The last record that Cazares appeared on Digimortal & was a slight disappointment...and lets face facts Transgression wasn't that much better. (Archetype was a great return to basics record however) Mechanize is something of a hybrid between Obsulete & Demanufacture and even a small hint at FF's earlier Death metal leanings. (Soul of a New Machine & Concrete) \\"Industrial Discipline\\" is an example of the old FF meets Obsulete with a guitar solo and something they hinted at on Archetype- blast beats... (granted there's scarce moments of it)lots of Herrera-esque double bass frenzy. Gene Hoglan- a respected name in extreme metal drumming was a smart choice- if anyone is going to compare to Herrera- it's Hoglan. (If you need further proof besides this record- check out Individual Thought Patterns by Death who actually manages to give Sean Reinert a run for his money!) Bell's vocals go between aggressive gutteral yells to melodic passages. Cazares & Straud do the traditional machine gun guitar that has now become trademark. Nothing but good things to say about the actual disc- to spite my misgivings to the name...Powerful stuff- highlights: \\"Industrial Discipline\\", \\"Christploitation\\", \\"Mechanize\\" & \\"Powershifter\\".

0811828697|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo30YDFB87FMAKA]]This hardcover is actually texture-pressed with scale patterns from a creature I can't identify. It has a nice touch.<br /><br />This is a field guide to the wildlife from the Star Wars planets. It's organised by planets and the included ones are Tatooine, Hoth, Dagobah, Naboo, Bespin, Endor, Yavin 4 and Coruscant. There's a short introduction describing each ecosystem -- fiery, freezing, vaporous, etc.<br /><br />The illustrations are sketches drawn with pencils and colour markers, supposedly by a zoologist in the field, but is actually none other than Terryl Whitlatch. They are all wonderfully detailed showing the creatures in their natural habitat, be it hunting, caring for their young, chilling out, or even on sale at some market on Coruscant. The attention to skin textures is very nice. You can almost get a feel just by looking. Beautiful colours also.<br /><br />Besides the paintings are field notes filling in on information like feeding patterns, mating habits, herding instincts and defensive mechanisms of these fascinating beings.<br /><br />I didn't know that the giant space slug is really that huge at 900 metres until I looked up the size of a blue whale for comparison, which is 33 metres. The space slugs gets nutrients from asteroids and you can see how the intestines work. Some of the designs you'll see are inspired by Earth animals. The Opee Sea Killer has characteristics from lobster (shell), frog (long sticky tongue), anglerfish (that glowing forehead tip) and the arowana (breeding little babies in the mouth).<br /><br />Some of the designs might look a bit far fetch but hey, this is Star Wars, this is science fiction. I guess anything goes but many are believable for the most part, in art and concept.<br /><br />This is a very good book for all fans of Star Wars and animal art.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog.

B0017JKEL8|5.0|After seeing the first season of \\"Mad Men\\", it's easy to see why it has won so many awards. The acting is superb. The stories and characters are engaging and interesting; you might not always like them, but they're never boring. The sets and costumes are very authentic. It only took watching one episode to get me hooked. Everything about the show feels authentic, with the characters having attitudes and behavior one would expect in the early 1960s. Many of the characters are seen drinking in the office and smoking everywhere. At times they are also rather sexist and racist. That's not to say these issues don't exist today, but they were even more prevalent then. As a result, the characters aren't always likable. Despite their many flaws, each character is developed enough to give you something to like or feel empathetic toward.    The main character, Don Draper, is the creative director at the Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency on Madison Ave. in New York City. He cheats on his wife, although he still seems to care for her and it's not quite clear why he cheats. Don is a very strong and talented person; besides infidelity, he has other flaws and a somewhat mysterious past. Betty is married to Don and they have 3 kids. She is not quite happy with her life as it is. While she is not weak by any means, Betty plays the obedient wife role to Don and raises the kids with the help of a maid. Peggy Olson (my favorite character) is Don's new secretary. Coming to the big city from a smaller town background is an adjustment for Peggy, who still dresses as a young woman might in school; Miss Holloway, the head secretary, tries to mold Peggy in her image. While Peggy is soft-spoken, she soon shows she has her own talents. Pete Campbell is a young account exec whose family is wealthy and well-known. He's engaged to be married but is attracted to Peggy too. He clashes with Don in his attempts to get ahead in the company. Also working at the agency are many other interesting characters, from the art director Sal Romano to the partners Roger Sterling and Bert Cooper.    The storylines are varied, with the ad agency setting providing interesting client interactions and the diverse characters' lives being anything but dull. With great writing and acting, every episode is different and lead one into the other with a continuing story. Thankfully, missing an episode isn't a problem when you have the show on blu-ray or DVD.

For anyone who likes GaGa you know she makes great music. For those that are curious about what all the fuss is about its all here for you to listen to. This album has songs for everyone on here and its a delight to listen to with artists coming out with lackluster music nowadays its great to hear someone original and fresh.

B001LF347E|5.0|This is by far one of the best TV series I have seen in a very long time. It quickly draws you into the relationship between Merlin and Arthur. You begin to see how one person can influence another for good over the long haul (and Arthur needs it)! The relationship between Merlin and Gaius is also delightful to watch. These three actors are phenomenal and certainly carry the show. The sets are amazingly authentic...you feel like you are right there in the middle of it all. For a TV show it is certainly beyond what I have come to expect and is great family entertainment (except for young children due to some scary themes/scenes).

0451531019|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

159448385X|5.0|I personally enjoyed \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" more so than \\"The Kite Runner.\\"  This could have something to do with the fact that I read his second bestseller first, or maybe that I have some personal experience that linked me to the characters. Either way, there's a lot of people who would disagree with me.   However, many of those who disagree do so because they were semi-expecting \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" to be the same. Clearly, Hosseini's choice of characters in his second book affected the storytelling. Amir's voice is not the same as those of the women in this novel, which I assume would affect the tone and writing. Also, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" tries to develop several characters (Mariam and Laila) in different time periods, unlike  \\"The Kite Runner,\\" where the main focus throughout the entirety of novel is on Amir and Hassan.  Predictable as this book might be, it is far from being cheesy and it truly touches the heartstrings. I began reading this to pass a few hours on a transatlantic flight and I was unable to put the book down it was so good. Needless to say, I arrived at my destination completely sleep-deprived. It as a gripping and depressing story, but in my opinion, a very in-depth glimpse into that type of hardship and the unseen effects of war on the human spirit and on culture.

Not likely, they should have called in an airstrike or artillery  - the crazy taxidriver would have been blown away long before he came close  - walking alone at night in Iraq is a sure way to find yourself in a homevideo getting decapitated    Good story, good acting but I cringed at the action scenes

B00003CX5P|5.0|I am a huge fan of star wars. My top movies are the movies one through six. Mr. Lucas could have not done better in making all these great movies, such as \\"Indiana Jones\\" and \\"American Graffiti\\" and most importantly \\"Star Wars\\" Right now, I am kind of upset about Lucas leaving his movies with Dave Filloni. I personally think Filloni is ruining everything Lucas set out to do.    But enough about that. MOVIE TIME!!! Although this movie is far from the six (A new hope my favoite and The fantom mennace is 3rd) but still even though it seems it belongs with two and three, I like to think of it as a median bettween the first three and the last two. In graphics for example; they are far beyond four five and six. But inferrior to two and three. Also how they made the movie is a similar situation.    The plot is hard to follow, which is a good thing, if you did not see the last two this one sets up Darth Vaders past but it sets you wondering and craving for the next movie. In fact in my oppinon it is the hardest untill two came around. I was four years old when this magnificent movie came out, but I did not understand the whole plot once I was twelve. But don't worry, if you think about it after the movie is over, there is allot more going on than it appears.     The trade Federation is blockaded by the greedy nemodians and the Suppreme chanselor of the glactic republic sends two Jedi's (obi-wan kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn) to investigate the matter and hopefully come to a diplomatic end. That is as far as I go. But there is much more to come. Lucas did a phenominal job.     As for the disc itself, it comes with a bonus disc with at least three hours of bonus material. Both discs came in without a scratch. There is an easter egg as well. When you hit \\"play movie\\" the twentieth century fox logo comes right away. There, hit the skip button (not fast forward) twice in a row. Then it has blopers of the movie. This trick works as well for the other two newer movies.    May the forcebe with you.

B001GSTOAM|5.0|If you're a programmer, then you know that most time is spent on maintaining code from existing projects, rather than starting fresh on new ones.  And you know that writing good code is sort of an unwritten rule among good programmers, aptly stated by Robert Martin as the \\"boy scout rule\\".       If you've ever inherited a project which had lots of bad code, you know the pain and frustration one feels trying to understand it.  And of course you'll want to make sure that whoever takes over your source code doesn't feel the same way about your code.  To do so, you should get this book.  And you should read it and re-read it and keep it as a reference whenever you feel the urge to rewrite your code a little bit better, a little bit cleaner.      There are other books of course that cover some aspects of clean code in various ways, but I feel this book had the most focus and coverage of detailed examples on how to write \\"clean\\" object oriented code.  For me, it was the equivalent \\"how to write good code\\" book for programmers, that \\"Elements of Style\\" or \\"Writing That Works\\" was for writers in general or writers in business.   And the fact that it has some detailed examples on even well known open source code projects, illustrates that there's always room for improvement in writing clean code.

962634394X|5.0|EMMA, Jane Austen's fourth novel was published in 1815 and dedicated to the Prince Regent, later King George IV.  Austen privately abhorred the Regent for the treatment of his wife Princess Caroline and his dissipated lifestyle. In 1813 she wrote to her friend Martha Lloyd, \\"I suppose all the World is sitting in Judgement upon the Princess of Wales's Letter. Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman, & because I hate her Husband.\\" She did however recognize the value of his name and agreed to the dedication. Upon publication EMMA also had its own share of critics. What impressed early readers was not that it lacked energy and style, but that its story was dull and uneventful. Even Austen's famous publisher John Murray thought it lacked \\"incident and romance\\" and Maria Edgeworth, a contemporary author so greatly admired by Austen that she sent her one of the twelve presentation copies allotted by her publisher, could not read past the first volume and thought \\"there was no story in it.\\" Ironically, what these two prominent and well read individuals attributed as a weakness is actually EMMA'S greatest strength.<br /><br />If one looks beyond the surface, EMMA is an intricate story focused on the astute characterization and social reproof which Austen is famous for. Emma Woodhouse is a complex character that on first acquaintance is rather a pill. Austen gave herself a great challenge in creating \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like.\\"  In contrast with her other heroines, Miss Woodhouse does not have any social or financial concerns and thus no compelling need to marry. Therein lives the rub. We have no sympathy for her whatsoever. She's rich, she's spoiled and she's stuck up. Who indeed could possibly like such a \\"troublesome creature\\"? During the course of the novel we witness her exerting her superior notions of who is suitable for whom as she match makes for her friends with disastrous results. It is no wonder that Maria Edgeworth gave up reading EMMA after the first volume. At that point we have met most of the characters in Emma's insular world and are coming to fully understand her ignorance and misguided perceptions in relation to them. She is truly exasperating. Austen tests our endurance fully as the novel progresses and her heroine continues to make mistakes. It is a testament to her skill as a writer and deft comedian that she holds our fascination with the \\"busy nothings\\" of every-day country life in Highbury, a small village filled with endearingly flawed characters. The transformation of the heroine from spoiled and insufferable into a contrite, mature and likeable young lady that you want to root for, is nothing less than remarkable. It is truly a shame that Edgeworth could not recognize the genius of Austen's sly sashay of characterization into a world that could be your own neighborhood. We can only account that, \\"One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\"<br /><br />If you liked the new BBC/PBS miniseries Emma (2009), enjoy the original novel with all of Austen's resplendent language in this expertly produced audio recording. Read by acclaimed British actress Juliet Stevenson, viewers of the 1996 movie adaptation of EMMA will remember her superb portrayal of the vulgar a vacuous Mrs. Elton and know you are in for a treat. Adding equal measure of energy and humor to each of the characters, Stevenson's perfect blending of a classic novel and a sensitive interpretation enhanced my enjoyment greatly. Pop this one into your CD player or iPod during your commute to work. I highly recommend it. \\"It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do.\\" Ch 21<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenproseup reading EMMA after the first volume.

B001TD1XWG|1.0|Absurdly miserable auditory experience.  Horrid, schmaltzy guitar riffs with poor production value.  Slopped together songs with little to no binding thread.  Terrible song crafting and even worse execution.  And the worst thing, the very worst thing, is the one thing Wayne has - the one skill - rhyming: non-existent!  His rhymes on this album are completely absurd!  A 10-year-old Lil' Bow Wow brought more to the table.  Yikes, this one will never get a repeat spin.  Worse than Chris Cornell's hip hop album.
0062511408|1.0|DESACUERDO.  Que me gusta la tema general- la de seguir los sueños- pero solamente cumpli leyendo este libro por fe de que no todos podrian estar equivocados sobre El Alquimista.  HACE CONSTAR:   Sí.  Estan Todos Equivocados (menos ellos como \\"Eli\\").  Este libro defina cliché.  La trama no tiene nada que ver con \\"alquimia\\" cualquier significara este termino.  En lugar de algun sentido de magia (como se presenta en libros como Harry Potter) este libro se impregna con un sentido meta-religioso que a veces cita a la Biblia Sacra, pero mas frequente acerca a un nocion de auto-deificacion.  Enfatiza la santidad de la naturaleza y las \\"señas\\" que nos puede dar.  La mezcla resulta absurda.  En manos de un autor mas diestro, quiza podria yo involucrarme mas con esta tipa de espiritualidad, pero Paulo Coelho (por lo menos en su version del libro espanol) no es este autor.  La unica cosa que puedo decir en favor de este libro es que es facilisimo para leer.   De verdad soy hablante primeramente de ingles, y un estudiante EEUU.  No tuve que consultar mi diccionario ingles/espanol ni una vez.  Entonces, verdad que si seas un estudiante nuevo de espanol podras leer El Alquimista con exito pero probablemente con ganas de arrancarse los cabellos tambien. En ingles:  Predictable, Cheesy, Sappy, Cliche!

B001TD1XWG|1.0|There's a scene in the 2009 documentary The Carter where the film's main subject, Lil Wayne, fresh off a cough syrup-fueled, barely coherent recording session, tells the interviewer just how he wants to become king of the music world: \\"To be an ultimate artist, I believe you have to be like me, I try to do everything . . . when you be lookin' for a Lil Wayne album, you gonna be lookin' for the best rap, the best singin', the best songs . . . full of music, I want you to look for that, not just what you look for now . . . I'm re-creating the face of music period . . . that's how I want to be, I do everything good.\\" Throughout much of the documentary, Lil Wayne is incredibly hard to understand, but here the directive is painfully clear. It's the kind of hubris that allows an album like Rebirth to get made, the kind of egomania that causes studio heads to shut their mouths and let the pint-sized New Orleans rapper try to branch out like an overzealous marketer. The Carter shows a man oblivious to the opinions of those around him and confident only in that he is the best there is, wherever, whenever, in whatever. Likewise, Rebirth is the kind of album only the painfully oblivious could make.<br /><br />His so-called \\"rock\\" album, it's clear right off the bat that Lil Wayne is not only deluding himself from everyday reality but also from what constitutes rock `n roll, at least in this day and age. From the hilariously `80s, Guitar Hero-esque solo intro of opener \\"American Star\\" to the obscenely grating breakup anthem \\"The Price Is Wrong,\\" everything here points to Rebirth as a colossal f***up of the highest order, a misjudgment of talent and ideas that any label exec not blinded by Tha Carter III's huge sales should have vetoed within seconds. Listening to the entire twelve tracks, it's nearly impossible to see just how Wayne okayed this; then again, this is the same man who declared that, if he was President, he would \\"make prostitution legal in about five more states [and] put cocaine back in Coca-Cola,\\" among many other revolutionary changes.<br /><br />The rapping, the hilariously generic instruments and beats, the \\"singing;\\" everything here speaks to a man with only the vaguest idea of how rock `n roll really works. Going from an Auto-Tuned, maniacal version of Billy Corgan to his typically unintelligible Louisiana patois, Wayne runs the gamut from pimping drugs to pimping women to moaning over heartbreak to celebrating the rock star lifestyle with the same general speed and fury, shifting only a few degrees in tone over the course of the album and essentially making every vocal performance he puts down sound eerily the same. Needless to say, Wayne's vocals are hardly suitable for singing; listening to him moan out \\"oh no this ain't paradise\\" and squeal out his best pained Nickelback imitation on \\"Paradice\\" or try out nu-metal on \\"Ground Zero\\" is an exercise in grueling, herculean patience.<br /><br />Even discounting Wayne himself, there's precious little to like here, largely due to the producers' insistence to make every track sound as bombastic and outsized as Creed on a stadium tour with absolutely zero attention to subtlety of any kind. Every guitar here screams out vulgar solos, the drums seem miked for an arena regardless of the song, and the unvarying verse-chorus-verse chorus would make Puddle of Mudd cringe in shame. Even the tracks that are mildly listenable succeed simply because Wayne stays away: Eminem's ace guest spot on \\"Drop The World\\" saves a forgettable song, and \\"Knockout\\" is easily the most enjoyable song on the album thanks to Nicki Minaj and not Wayne singing the majority of the verses. Or maybe it's just because the tune rips its riff right off blink-182's \\"Dammit.\\" Hell, I'll take what I can get.<br /><br />Perhaps the most telling line in The Carter comes near the three-quarter mark, when Lil Wayne, in response to a question about the explicit nature of some of his songs, remarks, \\"I don't care aboutno one's thoughts, no one's thoughts matter to me, at all.\\" It's the purest definition of Lil Wayne himself, an enigma who drowns himself in cough syrup but retains the ability to memorize all of his many songs without a single notebook and recreate them flawlessly. In a way, Rebirth is a tragic album for a soon-to-be-tragic figure; now that Lil Wayne is facing numerous drug and weapon charges from the past two years, he will soon have to take responsibility for his increasingly reckless actions. Now if only the music industry could stand up and have him take responsibility for this abortion of a record, there might be some real justice in the world.ughts matter to me, at all.\\" It's the purest definition of Lil Wayne himself, an enigma who drowns himself in cough syrup but retains the ability to memorize all of his many songs without a single notebook and recreate them flawlessly.

1577314808|1.0|I can't believe how much (unnecessary) hype this book has. I agree with several of his ideas, though all already stated before, mostly in Buddhism.<br />Apart from the already existing ideas from other religions, this book has nothing to offer other than what this one guy thinks is \\"the path to enlightenment\\". Although not directly stated, he talks about his ideals as if they are the only way to \\"enlightenment\\".<br /><br />This author is trying to \\"teach us\\" something we already know. He always talks about \\"killing your ego\\". First of all, whether you like it or not, it's IMPOSSIBLE to stop thinking. Our \\"ego\\" is what allows us humans to suppress our instincts. Human evolution isn't only about losing our fur, it's about improving our thinking power. You want to witness how someone would look like without thinking? Go take a look at an animal, most of them act purely based on instinct.<br />Eckhart loves talking about \\"watching the thinker\\" too. If he calls that getting rid of your ego, I say he's tripping balls. The act of watching your thoughts is merely just creating a second ego who is watching your original ego. Watching the thinker is as close to thinking as thinking itself.<br /><br />This guy tries to teach us how to be enlightened and enjoy the Power of Now. According to this book, apparently after you learn how to enjoy the power of now, you'll be happy with your life.<br />Look people, we all know how to enjoy the power of now. Read a book you really like, watch a movie you enjoy, have sex, play some games, eat good food. You notice something similar within all of these activities? Yeah, we all enjoy \\"the power of now\\" doing these activities, we don't need to LEARN that.<br />If you really want to enjoy the power of now, go do stuff you really like. Love someone. Have a hobby for which you are passionate about. Or get laid.<br />You don't need to learn how to enjoy \\"the power of now\\" to be happy, you need to find activities that make you happy, and the power of now will come naturally.<br /><br />I bought this book hoping to learn something new, and all I got was a reminder of all the good ideas Buddhism holds (which you can get ANYWHERE on the internet or a book devoted to Buddhism itself) and useless ramble about how Eckhart is tripping balls on things humans do naturally, like thinking.<br /><br />Here's my theory on why Eckhart believes he is enlightened:<br />He said he was suicidaly depressed. Sounds like he didn't have anything in life he was passionate about, how sad for him. Being depressed all your life (not knowing how it feels to be happy) then suddenly feeling happiness will be overwhelming, but NOT (I repeat, NOT) enlightenment. It may feel like enlightenment to him because he doesn't even know what being happy feels like. But logically speaking his ideas make no sense at all. I'm a very logical person. As I read this book I was trying to fit the pieces together logically and it's IMPOSSIBLE. This book makes no sense at all, it just sounds pretty.<br /><br />How can someone become enlightened overnight while passed out? That's the stupidest part of the book. Good for Eckhart, he learned to be happy in his own weird way of \\"killing his ego\\" (although it's more than obvious his ego is quite huge). Good for him, it doesn't mean his way of thinking applies to everyone. We all find our own ways for being happy.er of now will come naturally.<br /><br />I bought this book hoping to learn something new, and all I got was a reminder of all the good ideas Buddhism holds (which you can get ANYWHERE on the internet or a book devoted to Buddhism itself) and useless ramble about how Eckhart is tripping balls on things humans do naturally, like thinking.<br /><br />Here's my theory on why Eckhart believes he is enlightened:<br />He said he was suicidaly depressed.

B0030BOCEG|5.0|I'm from Europe and I've been a HIM fan since Wicked Game came out over 10 years ago and I really, really like this album! I like the fact that there is a little bit of Depeche Mode and Guns N'Roses in it too. \\"Disarm Me\\", \\"Scared to Death\\", \\"Katherine Wheel\\", \\"Like Saint Valentine\\", and \\"Ode to Solitude\\" are some of the best songs HIM ever made!    For me, this album is a mix of \\"Razorblade Romance\\" and \\"Venus Doom\\". Can't wait to see them in concert again!

1416594787|4.0|This is one of the few biology related texts that I literally could not put down. It is a page turner - a fascinating account of the beauty and simplicity of evolution, coupled with its extraordinary explanatory power. Dawkins covers many areas - biogeography, paleontology, molecular biology, comparitive anatomy, etc. and shows how all add to the mountain of evidence that supports the modern theory of evolution. Writing in a clear, informative style, Dawkins achieves exactly what he set out to do - provide enough evidence from various lines to prove once and for all that life arrived at its present form via descent with modification.    My only quibble is with the manner in which Dawkins dismisses and belittles people of faith. Now, having to deal with creationists on a daily basis must be an incredibly frustating experience. There is nothing worse for an educator than to be presented with the opinions of someone who is not simply ignorant, but is to all intents and purposes *willfully* ignorant. Be that as it may, I suspect that those who take issue with evolution will use Dawkins' obvious frustration as an excuse to dismiss the entire work. I would love to have members of my extended family read this book - but I know that they will reject it out of hand as the work of an atheist who is trying to destroy the basis of their beliefs. That may or may not be true, but it is certainly the perception that comes across. This is sad, becuase creationists could learn so much about the truth of evolution from this book.
B0024396WE|5.0|A wonderful movie about a pianist whose life is ruined by the war and the nazi's and his family is sent to the war camps and how he survised the war. I recommend that everyone see this movie.  Great acting.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|When I´ve seen the actual play on Broadway, I thought nothing could be better than that. And, even now, I still thinking the same way, but this Blu-Ray is the best way to bring home a piece of this classic. I didn´t believe it would be possible to have a quality like this on a remastered movie, but it´s almost perfect. The sound is awesome and images are crystal clear. One of the bet Blu-Rays in my collection!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great Headphones.. they are the first professional ones I got, and it was worth the money..<br />The only thing you have to keep in mind, is that if you are going to use this headphones outdoor, and by that i mean anyplace that is not your house or office, it can get a little bit bulky ( the cord is 3m) .. so you can only imagine they where made for indoor use.. after all, they are monitor headphones.<br />But a part of that..they are great.. it makes the acoustic sound so good.

B0017U7PT6|2.0|This was rated 2-stars only because the scenery and visual effects kept my attention to the end.  The plot is exceptionally trite: Woman stolen by raiders as sex object (Evolet) and chased after by amorous male (D'Le).  The ending falls apart when Evolet is gratuitously killed and brought back to life. The viewer is constantly asked to suspend disbelief when confronted with totally inaccurate representations: slave traders on horseback with saddles and rope stirrups (but then, in the absence of discretely hidden saddle horns and rope stirrups, how could the slavers drag a line of people behind them, let alone one person, without being jerked off their horse), having to travel from Northern Europe, across Africa and the Sahara Dessert to arrive at the Nile from the West (How did they ever walk across the Mediterranean Sea?), having an advanced civilization with a full command of navigation, textiles and metallurgy exist only within the construction sited of the pyramids, having the pyramids at Giza being build by slaves and Woolly Mammoths (there has never been any evidence of slave labor, and, I doubt that Wooly Mammoth bones have never been found at the site), having the pyramids of Giza left unfinished after the slaves destroy the advanced civilization, and, having the Sahara exist as it does today (desert) rather than as it did 12,000 years ago (tropical forest).  One must also ask the question, Why did a small band of slavers travel thousands of mile to the glacial peaks of Northern Europe to capture a handful of slaves when they had all of the Near East and North Africa at their door step?  How could a small band of men walk all the way to Giza and back in such a short period of time?

0307454541|1.0|This was listed as one of my recommendations from Amazon, and because of the reviews I bought it.  I don't get it, what is the hype all about?  I cannot get into the story, the violent sex seems unnecessary and, to be simple, just gross.  I don't have a lot of free time to read, and this wasn't enough to catch my interest at all.
0618154248|4.0|My son likes the books I think mostly because of the size. he is 18 m and it is easy for him to carry. He really likes the rides book and the fishing book, doesnt really care much for the other two.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|I should have listened to the 30 second clips on amazon music to find out that most of the tracks on this cd were NOT to my liking.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|I bought this album originally because I couldn't find one of the greatest Beatle songs ever (in my opinion) on iTunes, John Lennon's version of \\"Rock and Roll Music\\".  His passion and energy on this song is so infectuous, the way he loses his voice at the end!  But in purchasing this album, I also realized a lot of other, lesser-known Beatle songs that still make you take notice \\"all those years ago\\"!  \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" with the cheesy-sounding organ in the background still packs a punch, as does \\"Everybody's Trying to be My Baby\\" and \\"Honey Don't\\" -- two of Carl Perkins' classics!
B00297FEUS|3.0|I was excited when I saw this CD was being released. I'm a HUGE fan of Twisted Sister and Dee Snider, and own all of their original recordings. They helped to pioneer glam metal back in the 80's and they had some of the most rockin' tunes ever created. The original Stay Hungry was, and always will be, a classic. A \\"must own\\" if you're a fan of this style of music. Since I already own the original Stay Hungry, I decided to buy this based on the new, previously unreleased songs on disc 2. I was disappointed when I heard them. The song writing is exceptional, and the songs exemplify the original sound of TS music. And it's awesome to be able to hear the way they sounded back in the early days. But these aren't full songs. Most of them are under 2 minutes. Every time I listen to them I feel like someone unplugged my ipod in mid-song. It leaves me with an empty, unsatiated feeling. So this gets 3 stars on the merits of the original tunes, but nothing more as the songs on disc 2 leave me wanting more...    If you alreayd own the original Stay Hungry album and want to hear Twisted Sister's old stuff from back in the day, I HIGHLY recommend you look into Club Daze, Volume 1: The Studio Sessions. That will rock your socks off!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Movies like this do not come along very often.  This is one of those rare sci-fi films that does not involve aliens trying to take over the world.  This is a very ugly portrait of man in contrast with a rather gullible alien species.  They are almost like a swarm of bees with no queen throughout the movie.I do not want to spoil the whole movie so I will not go into details.  I went to see this in the theater, and almost got so enraged that I got up and walked out.  It is very real and in your face!  It does not play on any of the hokey or campy tricks on you that some sci-fi movies tend to depend on (you know, the ones that you hear someone in the audience slap their forehead and moan over).  This is not a movie for kids at all.  It is very violent and very graphic.  They do that for a reason.  It is to try and bring a more realistic feel to the film.  But, this kind of film is not for everyone.  It is not for those that like happy endings, or for people who can not handle in your face type movies.  But it does lend a different perspective on how we treat outsiders and even each other as a species.  I am sure there are parts of this that have been done in one fashion or another, but not in this combination.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I want to buy this video for everyone I know. You will never shop for meat (beef, pork) or poultry again in the same way, at the same places that you always have. Who knew? This is a real eye opener if you can watch all of it. It's pretty graphic so not for young children. I ask every store I shop in where they buy their meat and poultry. I only shop now at local butchers that buy locally from range free and grass fed animals. This is a must see for everyone. It doesn't say you should become a vegetarian, it's simply an incredible documentary if you will of what we are consuming and how we can make smarter choices. Monsanto and Tyson should be shut down. Watch this! You'll be doing yourself and your family a favor!

1433502399|5.0|I ordered this bible after looking at my husbands NLT study bible and realizing I could really use a study bible.  I really enjoy the beauty of the ESV translation, and decided to get the ESV study bible.  After recieving it, I couldn't be happier with my choice.  The helps far exceed those of the NLT study Bible.  On a theological level, it seems that the publishers tried to keep theological slants out of the mix so those of either Arminian of Calvanist views can read and enjoy this Study Bible.  If you want a Bible that leans entirely one way or the other on those theologies, this may not be for you.  I really enjoy how it gives historical helps to help explain why certain verses are so important, especially in the Old Testament.  I am a petite gal, so I will warn you, that this is by no means a small bible.  In fact, my leather bound ESV Study Bible is thicker than my husband's NLT Study Bible. That said, it is a small package for the wealth of helps it contains.  I would recommend this Bible to anyone who wants to be do in depth scripture study.

B002OB9KPE|4.0|Begin vorig decennium gold Transatlantic  als een all-star united progrock fenomeen, bestaande uit het kwartet Neal Morse (zang, toetsen, gitaar; Spock's Beard), Roine Stolt (gitaar, percussie, toetsen; Flower Kings), Mike Portnoy (drums; Dream Theater) en Pete Trewavas  (bas, zang; Marillion). Toen Neal Morse in 2002 zowel de met zijn broer Alan opgerichte band Spock's Beard als Transatlantic verliet om zich als christen beter te kunnen ontplooien in een solo-carri&egrave;re, verscheen in 2003 nog wel de in 013 Tilburg opgenomen Live In Europe DVD. Na 7 jaar, in 2009, kwam het viertal weer bij elkaar. Morse gaf aan, dat het `goed voelde' weer iets te doen als Transatlantic. De dubbelCD The Whirlwind is het resultaat. Schijf 1 bevat het 12-delige epic der epics (terminologie Morse) The Whirlwind, dat van Overture  tot aan Dancing With Eternal Glory bijna 78 minuten tempowisselingen, solo's op gitaar, toetsen, bas en drums en allerlei melodielijnen uit je speakers stormt. De heren zijn niet vergeten te zingen en textueel is er diepgang zonder aanvankelijk te prekerig over te komen. Illustratief zijn frasen als \\"But listen through the wind you'll hear him now. Working wonders though we know not how. Before we're raised up he's got to break us down.\\" (On The Prowl) en \\"This world is not our home. You can live like a rollin' stone. But you cannot escape with your life. We seek a city on fire. With the trust of a child's desire. We will cross that bridge and enter into life...real life.\\" (Rose Colored Glasses). In deel 12 blijkt er in het oog van de wervelwind toch Iemand die redt, een koninkrijk heeft, ons uitnodigt Hem te zoeken. Wel opvallend hoog gospel gehalte voor een band die naar mijn weten buiten Neal Morse om niet zoveel met het christelijk geloof heeft. Aan de andere kant verbindt de groep wel de naam Transatlantic aan wat voor de meer kritisch ingestelden ook als een volgend Morse album kan doorgaan. Voor de rest strak gespeelde topmuziek, uit de studio, her en der ietwat ingehouden.<br /><br />Na deze lange zit op schijf heeft schijf 2 van de special edition ander materiaal voor je in petto. Het 10 minuten durende Spinning met Beatlesque samenzang is een gezamenlijk geschreven nummer. Lenny Johnson is door Stolt geschreven, terwijl Morse met Trewavas For Such A Time pende. Van Trewavas is Lending A Hand. Dan volgen covers van Genesis` The Return of The Giant Hogweed, Procol Harum's A Salty Dog, America's I Need You en Santana's Soul Sacrifice. De dubbelaar is een aantrekkelijk opstapje naar Transatlantic's concert in 013 Tilburg op 20 mei aanstaande.ietwat ingehouden.

B000E41MS6|4.0|I was never a Doctor Who fan, thinking it was obscure, British, and old. However, I decided to give it a shot and started watching Doctor Who, beginning with this season here. I was hooked! The first episode seems a little silly but after that things pick up quickly. You don't have to know anything about Doctor Who to start watching, since the show was off the air for awhile and it was put back on the air with the idea of catching a whole new audience. However, if you do know about Doctor Who, it's really fun to see old friends and species that reappear. Anyway, as an American girl who had never watched Doctor Who before, I went from watching this one season to watching all of the recent stuff and then going back to watch the old stuff too. I would definitely recommend this show, and this season in particular, to anyone interested in a deep, thought-provoking, adventure-filled ride!
B000B8QG0O|3.0|The video works wonderfully, and it arrived quite quickly.  My only problem was that I wanted to give this as a gift, and it said it was \\"new.\\"  It was not new and it was not in the original packaging.  It seems as though the seller put together the packaging.    Not that big of a deal for me because I kept it for my son, and he loves it.    Looking for a better description I guess.    thank you so much though, and I would buy from you again.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I am not a fan of either non-fiction or history, but a friend of mine convinced me to watch this -- and I am so glad she did!  Historically, they went to great pains to portray the story with a high degree of accuracy both visually (in the background and scenery) and in the story itself.  The actors were well chosen for their roles and it not only kept my interest from the very beginning but actually drew me into the story to the point that I was sorry when it ended!  I actually learned a lot that I had never known about the characters.  Ok, so part of my increased interest was the fact that they're actually ancestors of mine and it was fascinating to see what they might have actually been like.  But even without that, I would have been highly entertained by this and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  In fact, I've already done so!

B0030BOCEG|5.0|As an oldschool HIM fan, they've helped me through rought times (especially in the M.East).  They have so much talent in music and poetry.  People are labeling this as \\"pop\\" just because it's a bit more upbeat, well we can't all live our lives in misery and regret.  I like it, it's refreshing and Ville's lyris are done very well and deep.  A true poet/musician writes what they're feeling in their current life, and if you can't except that, then you should move on... it's called reinventing the wheel, if it was all the same it would be redundant.  They will eventually go back into that Razorblade Romance mode, but he is human after all and writing music that fits his life because that's the way Ville is.

B000O599ZS|4.0|This film is slightly better than most films with John Wayne, but in retrospective. A farm is attacked by some Indians. Everyone is killed except a very young girl who is taken along by the Indian chief. The film is the story of the tracking of this chief and the salvaging, retrieval and liberation of the girl who was made the chief's wife, one of them. It shows how the girl will, when found, ask for her fellow whites to consider her life is set and settled now and that she must be left to her lot. They will fail this first time but they will go on searching for her and they will finally trap the Indian community and they will demonstrate their great generosity by killing all the Indians and only recuperating the white girl by force. At the time when the film came out it was vindicating that genocidal treatment of Indians based on the myth that the whites had the right to take Indian land without even paying for it. Today it is a perfect demonstration how deep that genocidal spirit is engrained in the American consciousness of history. We have to celebrate the very recent decision of Congress to provide some Indians with reparations for the way they were treated, even after having been parked in reservations, as a miracle of faithfulness to the principles of the Declaration of Independence, for whose Founding Fathers there was no doubt that Indians and enslaved or indentured people, mostly Black, were not born equal, because they were not born human. The film shows how the dominant culture in the USA and in Hollywood used the genocide of the Indians as a good conscience builder among the whites who were engaged in so many wars all around the world against \\"minority races\\".<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID

B002T9H2L0|3.0|Inglorious Basterds is a entertaining movie, and it has beautiful cinematography by Richard Richardson, but the movie is uneven mainly because Brad pitt and Eli Roth seem to be in a totally different movie from the rest of the cast.  The opening scene with the Nazi hunter is brilliant and intense, but then they cut to Brad Pitt who, seems to be hamming it up like he's doing a Oceans 11 movie.  His tone and rhythm are out of sync with the rest of the movie I mean like every time I saw Brad Pitt on the screen I couldn't help but laugh.  Even when he was doing acts of violence.  And ELi ROth needs to stick to directing his acting was over the top and he seemed to be in another movie also.  He was supposed be this big bad intense killing machine but when you saw him it seemed like Eli Roth hamming it up for the cameras, who is over joyed to be in a movie with Brad Pitt and Tarrantino at the helm.  I feel if the perfomances by these two actors were toned down just a bit the movie would have been much better and more hard hitting.
B002YIHO7I|3.0|Unless this cd grows on me and quick, this collection of songs by Sade is sounding a bit bland. I even played the cd today on a rainy cloudy day which would be the perfect weather to listen to Sade but there was something \\"off\\" about it.  I wasn't crazy over the cover art either.  Is that the ancient Inca ruins off in the distance?  But back 2 the music, none of the songs have really hit me over the head yet.  The Moon and the Sky is ur meat and potatoes Sade track.  Soldier of Luv is an ok track but did they have to make it so obvious with the military drums?  It also goes on 4 2 long dragging out the instrumental at the end.  Cool lyrics though, we're all soldiers of luv in one way or another, we're all victims.  Morning Bird is my fave track so far but it is also bittersweet to hear it because on January 9th my best friend in the whole world died on my couch right in front of me  of a morphine overdose and he liked 2 sing in the morning, so this song reminds me of him.  I almost had to turn it off.  Anywayz! Babyfather, Long Hard Road and B That Easy seemed like they ran together and practically put me 2 sleep.  How could there b 3 bad songs in a row?!  And the next song Bring Me Home is strange, with a jacked up beat that barely fits the vocals.  It's a negative song about some man or trick rather that won't drive u home after a regretful session of forgetable sex.  At least I think that's what it's about.  In Another Time seems 2 b ok, it's another Sade standard.  I haven't heard Skin or The Safest Place yet, I just hope they can make up 4 the rest of this affair.  Maybe I had 2 high of expectations since it has been 10 years since Sade's last album.  I wish she would just go with the flow and put out music on a regular basis.  I still love her music and style but she needs to go back 2 her more jazzy roots.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|The World at War is the greatest and most accurate documentary of the World War II period of history.  This is a no-holds-barred documentary unencumbered by any political correctness or point of view.  The choice of Lawrence Olivier to narrate is perfect not only because of his fantastic voice but because he was there in the thick of it.    This should be a required course for every high school student in this country (and beyond) because it removes the glory and valor of war and leaves only the grubby details of death and destruction.  It would go far in helping future generations to decide whether going to war is necessary or only a quest for power.    I cannot speak too highly of this series.
0143034901|4.0|Not quite the spectacular dazzler some would have us believe but a very captivating book with great characters, plot twists like a Chinese puzzle, Barcelona in the Fascist 50s as a setting and a nice sprinkling of Catalan proverbs and interesting parallels between our hero in the present and the writer he is investigating in the past. Don't let those comparisons to Borges scare you off. It's more like Reverte and very readable.
B002U6CJCE|3.0|It's hard to believe but it's been 17 years since the first UNIVERSAL SOLDIER film came out. In that time both stars Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren have made a number of pictures, some bad, some good, some in between. Both have gone on to the direct to DVD stature. Oddly enough, some of the direct to DVD films have been better than those released theatrically. The same can be said of those featuring both stars. Does that hold true here?<br /><br />The movie begins with terrorists kidnapping a teenage boy and girl to hold hostage. The children are the offspring of the country where the now famous city of Chernobyl is located. Famed for the accidental nuclear power plant leak, the plant remains to this day thought the city is deserted.<br /><br />Demanding the release of their comrades in arms, the terrorists have placed explosive charges on the power plant and are willing to set them off should their demands not be met. Having the kids on board is sort of icing on the cake in an attempt to force the issue.<br /><br />The U.S. military and that of the locals are brought in with an elite team to try and put an end to this situation. They bring along a four of the old universal soldiers (UniSols) from the past when they discover that one of the main enforcers for these terrorists is the next generation UniSol, the NGU or Next Generation UniSol as portrayed by MMA fighter Andrei \\"The Pitbull\\" Arlovski. These indestructible soldiers are built to withstand anything but the new generation exceeds the previous ones.<br /><br />The NGU can withstand bullets and beatings and is controlled by a scientist who left the UniSol program feeling he wasn't appreciated and now out to earn money as a gun for hire so that he might finish his experiments. Of course the terrorists don't appreciate him any more than his previous employers did. As back up, he's brought along one of the old UniSols, Andrew (Dolph Lundgren).<br /><br />When the elite U.S. team finds themselves shot to pieces and taken out by the one NGU, they make the decision to recruit the best of the best. That would be Luc Deveraux (Jean Claude Van Damme) who is in the middle of re-assimilation into the real world with the help of a psychiatrist. Realizing he is needed, months of work is tossed aside and enhancing drugs are used to bring him back to his full potential so that he might take out the terrorists.<br /><br />Not only are fans of the series treated to Van Damme coming back in a role they loved, they get Lundgren back as his adversary as well. The two face off when Deveraux hits the abandoned power plant/city as Andrew now has a mind of his own and is searching for answers. A non-stop battle royal between the two has them bashing through walls, beating one another and falling from buildings only to get up and continue the battle.<br /><br />Not only does Deveraux face Andrew though, keep in mind the NGU is out there waiting as well. So you get two big action packed face offs in this film for the price of one!<br /><br />Does the movie hold up though? For a direct to DVD film it's not bad. There's plenty of action from start to finish. But on the whole it lacks some of the humor from the first film, some of the humanity, and feels more like people just bashing each other about than anything else.<br /><br />Of the main characters Lundgren's comes off best with Andrew facing his past in his own mind. The questions posed to the UniSol's are one's he asks of his creators, questions about emotions the UniSol's aren't supposed to have and about the universe. Andrew wondered aloud about his place in the world and is tortured by his past. Lundgren, for an actor so many are willing to disregard as an action star, does a great job showing the torment of Andrew.<br /><br />The same can't be said of Van Damme. His performance here displays little or nothing. The character is now devoid of any and all emotion, even during the scenes in which he is supposed to be rehabilitatinghimself. It's nothing more than jump, kick, spin with only sparse dialogue. We see nothing of what is going on inside Deveraux's mind. He returns to the killing machine seen at the beginning of the original film. Even an attempt to see some glimpse at the end offers little.<br /><br />The movie is an action packed film. It does offer some great fight sequences. But for the most part it feels hollow. You're left with a feeling not that it's been done before but that there was no need for this film. Perhaps the words I'm looking for are cookie cutter. One part bad terrorists, one part main bad guy, one part good guy, toss into blender and make sure good guy wins. A simple formula that works, but in this case one that makes you wish for so much more.We see nothing of what is going on inside Deveraux's mind.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Alot of people have already described what this book is about. So I'll skip a breakdown of what it's actually about.    Here's what I really enjoyed about the book.    The writing. The characters.    While reading this book, I wasn't bored once. It had the wonderful balance to keep you involved in what was happening. It described living in District 12 as something that reminded me of what I think would feel like if I lived during the Great Depression. Just that kind of environment where there's not alot of food to go around.    I enjoyed the intro to the last page and was captivated by the story. I did feel a little like it was mature content and what kind of society would allow something like that to happen to children -- but then again, in the olden days, young kids were sent to Mills to work for cheap money until child labor laws came into play so....feasible, but terrible.    I could sympathize why Haymitch was drunk all the time. Not only did Katniss nail it on the head in the book-- having to sponsor children who in all liklihood would be killed -- but .... living through that would be terrible on your conscience. In the game, you would do what you had to do to survive-- but when it was all over, living with yourself, would be very hard I would think.    I felt that the characters were very descriptive and they made the plot of the book work, even as terrible of an idea as children killing each other to survive sounds.     The ending was so abrupt. I sat there, blinking at the last page and wanted to know sooo badly what Katniss' reunion would be like. But I will not break down and buy the next book in hard cover. I still want it for my Kindle. I'm stubborn enough to wait...or to go to the library if I positively can't stand the wait.    Wonderful book and yes, perhaps I should just break down and buy it to show my support for the book in hardcover, but I love my Kindle and that's where I'd like to read the next book. The adjustable font, portability, my carrycase, everything about my Kindle...I love. So that's where I'd like to hold a book that I'd enjoy reading :)
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I've had a total of 3 different Nikon Speedlights over the past 15 years, the last of which was the SB-26. This is by far the best speedlight I've ever purchased! Some complain about it's size... but it's about the same size as my old SB-26. I've had no problems with thermal shutdown on this flash.  I always have the protection enabled.  Perhaps those that have this problem always use bounce flash or use a diffuser box for all their flash shots. These boxes require that the flash more than DOUBLE the power used compared with using no light diffuser or bounce setting (which can more than TRIPLE the power used by the flash!).  Also I only use rechargeable eneloop batteries in an outboard battery pack for fast recycling times when shooting wedding receptions.  Yes, using rechargables in the flash itself will raise the temperature of the flash head becuase the batteries themselves can get very hot when taking a lot of flash shots in a short periond of time. Eneloop batteries provide more current than the old nicad batteries for quicker recycling times.<br /><br />Joseph Nowak<br /><br />Update 10/27/2012<br />I have had this flash unit (two of them) for quite some time now.  The replacement is the SB 910, which I will order (1).  The Creative Lighting System is GREAT!  I used it alot in the Philippines a couple of years back and it works even around corners for indoor shooting.  I have no doubts that the new 910 is just as capable!

B002TYZKIM|3.0|I watched this on DVD this weekend and it appears that Michael was putting together an animated, special effect driven extravaganza to end all animated, special effect driven extravaganzas.  Although these are not the kinds of things that get me excited to see a concert, this looked pretty special.  A couple of observations:  It was reported that Michael was looking great and holding up well.  For the most part, that was true; however, while at times, it was apparent that Michael was holding back (he even says as so), it appeared, on occasion, that he lacked the wear-with-all to bring it 100%.  He also was frighteningly thin, he looked completely disheveled at the press conference announcing this tour.     I don't like him on the old J5 stuff.  He could no longer sing in that key (hasn't for years) and he does the Whitney-Houston-hurry-up-and-sing-the-lyrics-so i-don't-have-to-hit-the-notes-thing that is irritating.  Even when he was in chill mode, his moves out shined his dancers.  Make no mistake about it, even in slow-mo, Michael was the star of this production and deservedly so.    Speaking of dancers, there are a ton of male camel toe on display, with a scene which is solely devoted to the adjustment of said camel toe.  This in itself was a revelation and This Is It should have been nominated for an Oscar based upon this scene alone.    In conclusion, I have to say that once the special effects, animation and almost singing are stripped away Michael's main talents were his dancing, songwriting ability and his sense of the theatrical.

B002PMV9FG|2.0|it was so dark i could barely see. i used to love the harry potter movies but lately they have just been such letdowns. the movie was nothing like the book and was so fast paced and mysterious i could not understand it. it seemed like the whole movie was an introduction. if it was not supposed to be based on a book but just a standalone movie i would rate it 3 stars which is not great. but it was based on a book and left out key points and changed many many things. the first movie was great the second was too the third was when they started to let me down, they  got darker and less like the books i wish they would put alot more thought into it, it would be worth the wait to get a good movie.   my suggestions;  >less darkness,  >less mystery the books were less mysterious explain whats going on make sure the audiance gets what message you are trying to convey,  >slow it down make sure its well paced and doesnt change scenes to quickly and to unrelated things so often,  >make sure the audiance you are aiming for gets the point and can see the purpose in whats happening, in that scene with the weasley house on fire, what was the point of that? it did nothing to move the plot forward.

0446569895|5.0|This is not your normal \\"music bio\\" it's so much more. As you read this book it feels like you are in a room with Ozzy while he tells his life story. I could not stop laughing, not at him, but at his amazing stories, and how well they are told. I was sad when I finished the book, for the stories were told and written perfectly. I never really laugh out loud when reading a book, maybe a few lines here and there in others but I could not stop with Ozzy's great story telling. While reading this book try to keep Ozzy's voice in your head so you get to hear that British accent.   Must read for those needing a laugh and for those who like Ozzy, If you do not like Ozzy I still suggest this book because it's written like a book I have never read before. Ozzy has broken the mold once again.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|We searched High and low to get a DVD version of the Muppets Christmas Carol with that wonderful song \\"The love has gone\\" still in it.    This was Certainly worth getting.  The song is one of the most sentimental parts of the film.  If Ebenezer scrooge ever had a reason for penting up his anger at the world and himself it was when he let Belle leave him.  Sacrificing love for money.    We dont know what Jim Henson was thinking when he edited it out!    The quality of the recording is not super sharp but better then the VHS version we have.

0393327345|4.0|I was tempted to have my review consist of the following: \\"The first rule about Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club. Therefore, I can't tell you what I think of this book.\\" But then I realized that would be a cop-out. As good as this book is, as original and satiric and insightful and artful as Palahniuk's words and vision are, I'm nearly at a loss to specify what it is I like about this book or why I like it. The main narrative gimmick (if you haven't read the book or seen the movie yet--STOP READING NOW)--the unreliable narrator who doesn't realize he has split his personality in two and developed an anarchic identity that seeks to subvert and destroy modern culture--is certainly clever, but it doesn't necessarily make the characters likeable (which, I suspect, Palahniuk was not trying to do in the first place), and the plot isn't especially engaging. The book is humorous in spots, but its description is spartan, and its postmodern tone can be stifling at times. Yet the book works. I'm eager to read Palahniuk's other novels and see his development as a writer. \\"Fight Club\\" is a heck of a first novel, and I'm dying to see what Palahniuk's done next.

B00005JNTX|5.0|SIN CITY is one of those miraculous movies that seems to come along every once in a while. Filled w/ violence, gore, insanity and murder, this is the hideous underbelly of hell on earth! Robert Rodriguez / Frank Miller have fashioned the perfect comic book on film. The overblown characters and impossible action take place in the netherworld of their combined imaginations, leaving us w/ a masterwork of incredible, explosive entertainment. Every evil person is a nightmarish ghoul or demon, embodied so well by the silent, stealthy, cannibalistic Kevin (Elija Wood). Every anti-hero is a darkened, jaded soul w/ one last shot at redemption. Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen are the grand trinity of retribution and cold, hard justice. Their characters dole out the vengeance, and pay dearly for their trouble. Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, and Rosario Dawson are just three of the many idealized, ultra-hot females worth killing and dying for. SIN CITY is a bleak universe soaked in corruption and death. It's police (Benicio Del Toro), it's politicians (Powers Boothe), and it's clergy / church (Rutger Hauer) are all rotting, stinking institutions, held together by greed, perversion, and terror. If you like your stories hard-boiled, bloody, and downright nasty, then SC should be your next destination...

They arrived today and were Express Mailed from CHINA. The package had \\"China Post\\" all over it and had US Customs documentation with it stating it was a \\"Gift\\" and no taxes paid. The green trays use packaging tape as a hinge to hold the trays together like a book and each DVD is in a little plastic bag.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|This is a remake of a Japanese film from 2002 with the same title. The original was directed by Hideo Nakata. This American \\"Dark Water\\" from 2005 is directed by Walter Salles, a Brazilian filmmaker who goes completely Hollywood with this production. I admit I haven't seen the original Japanese Dark Water but I can't imagine it's a better looking film than this.     I originally saw this movie in the theaters while visiting Manhattan in the summer of 2005. It's crazy just how many Hollywood films are set in New York. Don't New Yorkers get sick and tired of seeing their city plastered across the screen in every other movie? Who knows... perhaps they love it. This film doesn't actually take place on Manhattan proper but instead on the residential Roosevelt Island, which is linked to Manhattan by a connecting bridge. In the opening scene of the film we see Jennifer Connelly's character and her daughter crossing from Manhattan to the island via a lift. The visuals are immediately arresting even during the opening credits. I very much appreciate terrific cinematography, even for it's own sake and Dark Water does not disappoint on that front. It's got all the trappings of a glossy Hollywood movie. Connelly, who is frequently a terrific actress, seems to specialize in playing tortured females. Most of the time she's suffering because of the man in her life. In this film, she's a young divorced mother who has found an apartment for her and her daughter on Roosevelt Island, a location I haven't really seen in movies. With it's somewhat dilapidated apartment complexes, this story has a great atmosphere. It's not really a horror film, rather it just envelops the viewer in it's sinister locations.     The plot isn't much and the writing is full of the typical cliches taken from this well worn genre. The new apartment they move into is apparently haunted by some ghostly presence that has a bizarre interaction with water. The young mother begins to lose her mind little by littleuntil the big climax where the viewers get the inevitable revelation of the ghost's motivations for haunting the environment in which the characters reside. I can't recommend Dark Water for anything other than it's cinematography and first rate production design. Jennifer Connelly is always watchable although she's played this suffering female role so many times it's becoming ridiculous. Audiences who like low key ghost stories that go heavy on the atmosphere will get a kick out of Dark Water.

B001AR0D4A|3.0|There have been a lot of special releases on the Blu-ray disc format in recent years and this is one of the most original. Two versions of the same film in one package. One disc is in beautiful color as released in the movie theaters and the other is gorgeous black and white as the director wanted to make available for the home market. The first time I ever saw this movie was on youtube of all places in terrible quality, so talk about a step up viewing it on Blu-ray! The color version of the film is stunning, especially the daylight scenes outdoors with greens that simply leap off the screen. The black and white version is outstanding quality as well. I think most mainstream viewers will prefer the color version while the film buffs will gravitate towards the black and white just for that old school atmosphere.    Granted that this Blu-ray is stunning but technical details aside it still doesn't make an average film great. This is another in the multitude of subpar films based on Stephen King material. In this film bizarre creatures invade a small town after it is enveloped in a heavy mist. An assortment of people led by main star Thomas Jane get trapped inside a supermarket and have to fight for their lives against the strange invading lifeforms. The biggest negative aspect of this movie in my opinion is the lousy C.G.I. ( computer generated imagery ). The special effects are simply not first rate and tend to get goofy. Sure, there is plenty of blood and violence on display but I couldn't get past the underwhelming C.G.I. The black and white version of the film helps out somewhat in the sense that the effects look less intrusive with less color. Anyhow the film has a terrific atmosphere and anytime you have a movie with a bunch of townsfolk trapped in a small environment with bloodthirsty beasts outside you've got some entertainment value for sure. Stephen King usually has some religious or spiritual theme going on in his work and in this film we get a religious loon played by Marcia Gay Harden, one of the best characters in the movie. Little by little the rational people descend into survival mode and then the mayhem truly takes over.    The ending of the movie has caused some controversy as it's quite nihilistic. I personally have not read the story by Stephen King on which this is based so I can't report if the ending there is the same or not. I liked the ending as it's different from the Hollywood norm. The whole mystery of where the mist and it's inhabitants came from is another fascinating plot point which I won't reveal. Granted there haven't been that many outstanding Stephen King adaptations over the years but with \\"The Mist\\" and the recent \\"1408\\", this horror writer has made a welcome return to the screen. I enjoyed the quality of the Blu-ray and the fact they went all out for this release. The movie itself is a pretty decent genre film with solid acting and schlocky flicks like this are always fun to watch late at night.
0756655730|5.0|What really attracted me to this book was the variety of prehistoric life covered in decent detail. Not just the usual dinos and mammoths, but bacteria, algae, mollusks, mosses, ferns, trees, fish, turtles, insects, you get the idea, all sorted chronologically. The illustrations are high-quality, vivid and great eye-candy. Impossible to beat as an all-in-one volume. GREAT for students.
B000VD5I94|3.0|I don't think too much can really be done for Robocop visually as it's never been a really great looking film in whatever format... be it VHS, DVD or now Blu-ray high-definition. It's always looked grainy because of the film print used during that time. Many films from the 1980s have suffered in that respect. I have the Criterion Collection DVD, the Robocop Trilogy set with the MGM remaster and this Blu-ray release as well. This BD is by far the best the film has ever looked in the home market. Don't let anyone fool you into thinking that there's no upgrade from the DVD, those people are out of their minds. There is so much more detail in the film print and scenes that looked dull and two dimensional before have a sparkle and three dimensional life to them now. However all is not rosy as the many reviews on this page can attest to.    There is grain throughout, the colors don't exactly pop off the screen but Robocop is not a very colorful film anyway. The director's cut scenes with the additional violence from the so called X-rated cut always looked really lousy and didn't mesh as well with the rest of the film. This was a problem on the Criterion disc and the MGM releases too. That problem persists on the Blu-ray. Without a big restoration by the studio Robocop won't look much better than this in any format. The sound quality is actually really good, with a solid DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1 track. All the gunfire, explosions, dialogue and of course the fantastic musical score hit all the right marks. This is an impressive sounding Blu-ray for an action film from the 1980s. The extras are non-existent as others have noted and complained about save for the trailer. Not very impressive work by the studio. The Robocop 20th Anniversary DVD release had some good extras and that DVD sports the exact same cover art as this Blu-ray. It was released almost at the same time I believe and yet MGM's home video distributor is Fox Home Entertainment. Fox was at the time notorious for releasing a multitude of Blu-rays stripped of all special features while charging full price. All the DVDs had extras but the Blu-rays were stripped almost completely. Ridiculous is all I have to say about that. Now that this Blu-ray has come down in price, it's a solid deal for the Robocop enthusiast. I haven't heard of any news for a Blu-ray double dip. If you love this film like I do, there's no current better way of seeing it than right here.     Here are my actual thoughts on the movie, taken from my review of the Robocop Trilogy box set.    \\"As for the movie itself, what else can be said? It's a bonafide classic. The film works on so many levels. As science fiction, as satire of capitalist society, as a document of social depravity and immorality, as a human story about a man who loses everything and then regains his soul. Existentialism and all that and the film even works as an action movie, a revenge story for god sakes! Peter Weller gives his greatest contribution to cinema in his noble, dignified performance and this film is not only the best American movie Paul Verhoeven directed, it's the best film he's ever made period. Did I forget to mention the score by Basil Poledouris, wow! Does Hollywood even attempt such multi-layered sci-fi films nowadays? Doesn't seem like it!\\"     One of my favorite films of all time, in my top 10. I saw it for the first time back in the late 80s while I was still a citizen of the Soviet Union. Imagine watching Robocop in a Russian movie theater dubbed into Russian while you're a seven year old kid! Things like that stick with you and I've always found this movie to be fantastic entertainment with a human heart at it's center. That's why it remains a classic. I'm very skeptical of the supposed remake by Darren Aronofsky since I consider this film perfect in it's own unique way.

B000EGFVQS|3.0|When I requested the book it said the book was in excellent condition but it was more like fair condition. The cover was riped and had a couple of coffee stains on the cover. Other then that the book was in good condition.

0316017922|1.0|First, let's start with the obvious. The author of this book is successful, and I am not.  Still, a lot of books have been written about success before (7 Habits, Good to Great, etc.), and what he is trying to do seems way too hard, making things too simple.  Some thoughts about the book:  * More people on the Czech/Canadian Hockey teams were born in the early part of the year is true, but instead of people giving up hockey if people weren't born in the early part of the year as he suggests, some of the all-star players were born in December. (Similarly, according to Gladwell's logic, Obama should have given up trying for President, because all of the people before him were White.)  * He says that 14 of the 75 richest people in the world were born in the United States around 1835, the source given is Wikipedia, but it doesn't even meet their quality standards.  * Also that the best time to be born if you are starting in the computer industry was 1955. But, of the top 10 richest technology people in the United States in 2009 (Forbes), only 4 (Allen, Ballmer, Gates, and Eric Schmidt were born around 1955.) 3 of those 4 people are associated with Microsoft, so it seems to me like the best choice to be rich in the computer industry would be if you knew Bill Gates in high school or college.  * Gladwell says that above an IQ of 120, having a higher IQ doesn't provide any additional advantage, then gives lists of Nobel Prize winners of Chemistry and Medicine from the last 25 years in the United States, and the undergraduate colleges that people attended as evidence. First, it would be more compelling if he had given a list of all the Nobel Prize winners (except Peace) that presumably depend on intelligence. Just because someone went to University of Illinois or Holy Cross doesn't mean their intelligence isn't really high, say 160 or something like that.  If he had provided a list of the IQ scores of the Nobel prize winners, then we could see if what he had claimed was true.  * Gladwell says, not all people with high intelligence are successful, which is true. But is there anything where people have a certain trait that are successful? Are all people that work 10000 hours at golf or programming or being in a band successful? Being physically abused like Chris Langhan was I'm just guessing but likely makes people less successful.  * The author says that Jewish lawyers became the most successful because they were outsiders and were born at the right time , and had family in the garment industry, but wouldn't there have been more Catholics that were outsiders and born around 1935, so be likely they would be as successful as Jewish lawyers were during that period?  * For some reason, the author stereotypes people from appalachia (i.e. a subset of white people), but doesn't stereotype any other american ethnic groups.  * Gladwell claims that Asians are good at math because their ancestors worked on rice fields, and they work harder then Americans do (in general.)  But, if all you need is hard work for success, then why aren't there almost as many prominent law firms run by Asian Americans as there are Jewish Americans?  And if all you need to be successful at math is effort then anyone can be actuaries. (But I couldn't pass the exams and I have math and statistics degrees.)  * As for the KIPP program, if teachers/school employees got paid more based on how many days they taught in school proportionally versus where they are now, then they would probably support it. But, where would the money come from?    So, basically, everyone wants to be successful, right.  It seems to me like if you take risks, and it works out then you're successful, and if it doesn't work out, then you're a failure. A more interesting book on similar lines to this one is C. Wright Mills The Power Elite, which unlike Gladwell's easy, breezy style actually seemed like it actually took a lot of hard work and effort to write.
0307269981|5.0|This book was so good I'm sorry it ended.  One cannot help but like Lispeth Salander she is a wonderful character.  I like the Girl with the Dragon tatoo but I loved The Girl who played with Fire it has so many twists and turns, I can't wait for the last book in this series..one of the best I've read.
B000059GEI|5.0|Yes, the famous crooner of the fifties, in his only movie appearance.<br />Johnnie Ray. This cast has all of your favorites,<br />including Marilyn Monroe. And thankfully, it is widescreen, so you see the whole picture.<br />I watch this over and over and over. Johnnie was my favorite singer in the fifties.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|If you are more traditional when it comes to headsets, then this is for you. It makes FPS, TPS and even single-player more lively.<br /><br />Buy this product! 5/5
B00338QENI|3.0|The premise for this book was so interesting as was about 1/3 of the book.  I found it got tedious and felt that the book could have been written in half the words.  It got pretty boring to me.

B002WY65W4|4.0|Director Ruben Fleischer claimed he was inspired by Shaun of the Dead to make Zombieland, and it shows in spades.  Zombieland may be far from anything original, but the film manages to be an awesomely entertaining blast for its brisk running time, offering up equal parts hilarity and bloody mayhem.  Jesse Eisenberg stars as the nerdy Columbus, who has managed to survive the zombie-ravaged world by following a set of rules.  He meets the booze-swigging, Twinkie-hunting Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), and not before long, they run into double-dealing sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin).  What happens in between and after all that is some just plain hilarious moments, some great gore effects, and one of the absolute best big name cameos you'll ever see in any movie period.  While it doesn't reach that level of greatness that Shaun of the Dead managed to do, Zombieland is plenty enjoyable regardless, even if you're not a fan of zombie movies.  All in all, give Zombieland a look if you haven't already, you'll be happy that you did.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|Hey everybody. Remember my review of the Richard Lester version of Superman II? Well, I just saw the Richard Donner Cut and it was a huge improvement over the theatrical release. The plot is virtually the same. It picks up where the first left off, but is more in-depth in showing what happened to one of the missiles Superman dragged into outer space in the first movie. The explosion frees General Zod, Ursa, and Nod (please see my Lester version review for more details). The effects may sometimes be CGI, but remained similar to the first for the most part. The majority of the dumb gags were omitted in favor of a more serious tone like the first. The only two that remained were that careless kid at Niagara Falls and the scared mother with the baby carriage about to get crushed by debris until Superman saved her. The back-story on Lois searching for Clark Kent's secret identity as Superman is pulled off better. Lois discovers his secret by doodling glasses and a business suit on his newspaper picture. Instead of Superman tripping on a pelt and landing in the fireplace without a scorch (which is stupid), Lois dupes him with a blank in a gun. Big Improvement. For the sake of the continuity with Returns, Superman and Lois slept with each other before he becomes normal instead of the other way around, which is how their son in Returns was conceived, and the process of Superman becoming normal was less freaky. The big fight has improved as well and omitted the overused ice cream gag and the stupid man laughing on the phone while being blown away. The Fortress of Solitude is more detailed. The Marlon Brando footage was restored and showed how Superman restored his powers with Jor-El's help. Instead of using that convoluted mind-scrambling kiss to erase Lois' memory of the whole ordeal, he uses his time travel power again that looks like spinning Earth in reverse which looks more complex than the previous entry, and re-imprisons the depowered Zod, Ursa, and Nod in the PhantomZone forever instead of leaving them to die, as well as fixing everything. Well, almost everything. The only plot hole is that Clark gets back at the bully after spinning Earth backwards, but it would be less confusing if it was the other way around. Nonetheless, it is another worthy addition to the film series, almost on par with the first, and better than the Lester cut or some of the later films I previously reviewed. Check it out.
031606792X|1.0|i saw the first film 3 weeks ago on showtime and became a bit obsessed. i blew through the first three for...this??? what a dreadful book. sm has wonderful stories to tell but in this case it might have helped her to read the first book again to make sure she wasn't totally going back on her own stated rules or character developments. who were these people anyway? they were certainly not the characters i grew to know and love. the only good thing about this is it broke my obsession; i will only ever re-read the first book.
0446560065|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to any cat lover or friend of a cat lover. It's cute & funny and Simon Tofield is a wonderful illustrator. His talent is apparent in this book. If you like his videos-this book is a must have.
0375826726|3.0|I read all 3 back to back and Brisingr is definitely the weakest. I found myself skipping over stuff just to see what happens because this book is full of fluff. This almost never happened in the first 2 books. The details are way overdone and do not add to the plot. Also, the characters are getting weaker in my opinion. The reason I liked the 2nd book the best of the 3 was Roran's plot and the detail felt closer to appropriate. Once I had read the first 2, I \\"had\\" to read the 3rd one, but it was a long read with very little overall progress in the plot. I truly believe this book easily could have been about 300 pages less without sacrificing anything in the story or the visuals formed in my head. This is a book to rent from the library, skim through it for the main plots, and then wait for the final book and hope it goes uphill.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Love this CD just as much as her other CD.  I am not upset at the song versions on the CD.  THey are the same as on the radio.  My 8 and 5 year old like to listen and sing along.  I would rather have them say \\"freak bit\\" rather that \\"freak bitch\\" anyday, considering they do not know the word yet. Lady Gaga is a genious and I love her style.  Careful...the base will blow your speakers.

B000GFKUEK|5.0|Here is a great bargain !<br />Buxtehude at its best. Spang Hansen knows what he is doing with this composer. The choise of the organs are quite nice.<br />The only drawback on this box of CD is the abscence of an explanatory booklet. Nothing about the composer, nor the organist.<br />No background about the recording neither. The only references are on the back of each CD cover, a pity.<br />But overall price/quality can not be beaten !
0823023494|5.0|My husband is a beginning artist and is learning to draw and write in comic style for a hobby.  Since reading this book and using the techniques outlined his drawing has improved ten fold.  He has purchased several other books since beginning his hobby but not one has helped make such an improvement in his art.  I also have looked through the book and enjoyed \\"doodling\\" the unique characters and reading the art tips.  I come from an art background, however of a different medium, and have found this book both entertaining and useful.  This is one of the best \\"how-to\\" books I have read on art.  Easy to read and even easier to use.
0812973992|1.0|Boring, uninspired.  I was shocked to see all the good reviews.  You are constantly waiting for the book to pick up.  The problem?  It never does.  In some spots a light shines through, for just a brief moment, but then is taken away with monotonous lead-ins and poor development.  I finished the book just for the sake of finishing, not because I cared what happened at the end.
0670021652|4.0|I heard the interview with Elizabeth Gilbert on NPR and I thought this sounds great! Well it turned out that it was more like one of those movies where they give out too much in the preview. She basically said everything that was interesting in the interview. When I read the book it was basically just filling in the rest of the story with the timeline of her travels and the long wait for the visa.  I was skeptic about Eat, Pray etc but when I read it I loved it... this one was a little bit disappointing and maybe because my expectations were higher. I would have liked it if she went more in depth on the cultural aspect of marriages. Covering more cultures, more history or basically going more in depth. She does mention some examples here and there, especially her family, her grandparents but that are good examples but they not give you a deep overall understanding of history and cultural development.  Overall, it was still good since I still did get sucked in. Read the whole thing in a couple of days, got some interesting points from it - but I have to say it wasn't excellent.
B002RSDW80|2.0|I loved the Julia story - I so wish it would have been just all about Julia Child. I found nothing remotely likeable about the character of Julie, or her husband or her friends - but I did like her cat:) Cooking her way through a cookbook, Julia Child or not, was just not believable as life changing. And were we suppose to feel sorry for her in her 'dumpy' apartment? I thought it looked pretty good to me - just the whole story line of Julia was irritating.    Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci were pure delight - I can only hope they do another movie - maybe covering the Child's war years together.
039472903X|3.0|I wanted a book that would give me a good insight into the principles of Advertising, so I purchased \\"Ogilvy on Advertising\\"- based on the good reviews it had on Amazon.    Unfortunately I was dissappointed, as the book is very basic and is more a PR for Ogilvy and the AD campaigns his company executed.    This book is definately over rated !!
0439023483|5.0|I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  It was a fast read and I couldn't put it down from start to finish!  The story is set in the future and is about a young girl who is forced to \\"play\\" in these horrible games that were created by the government to remind all of society what will happen if they should rebel.  It is a gripping, and at times, heart wrenching tale and a must read in my opinion.
B00006LLNU|5.0|If you think this album is ambient then you are not fully paying attention to it and are missing everything it really has to offer.  ( ) really is the under appreciated masterpiece.  If you simply listen to this album it will not grab you they way it will when you REALLY get into it.  The thing that makes this album special are the LAYERS OF MUSIC delicately laced in. That is what makes this album unique and it requires multiple listens to find they layers... I listened to this album for over a year and still noticed little things in the music I didn't catch before.  Take for example the first song... not the most interesting song structure in the world, just a simple piano melody.  Yet the thing that makes this song so intresting are the tiny little sounds hidden in there.  The soft echoing, sustained chants that drift softly in and out of the song, the stringed arrangements, ect.  There are so many different and memorable sounds in each song and yet there is not enough to overwhelm you.  Not many people like this album when they compair it to \\"Aqueatis\\" but it is NOT Aqueatis and it is something different and more unique while still sticking to their roots.  Sigur Ros evolved by bringing their music down to a more simple level on this album and thats why I love it so much.    Who cares that the songs don't have names.  I think the point the band was making was that their music is a representation of their souls and the fans souls because people who are big Sigur Ros fans connect with their music on a very deep level... so we don't need lyrics or song titles because they are what they are and it's beautiful!  The music of Sigur Ros connects with certain people in a way few things ever can.  I don't want to bring their music up to a religious platform but I am just trying to say that as people, Sigur Ros \\"gets us\\" and their music represents that.    Get this album but if you don't plan on giving if multiple listens then your really messing out on something special
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|Just what the doctor ordered if you have an old camera or computer.  No problem.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|I'm going to start off by saying that the only reason why I didn't give the album 5 stars was because after waiting 10 long years for Sade to come out with another album, I was hoping for a little more.  A few of the songs didn't grab me right off the back.  There were only a few of the songs that I thought were a little bland, but overall the album is really nice.  It's definitely one of those albums that will soothe and relax you after having a long and hectic day. All of the songs have beautiful lyrics.  The songs Long Hard Road, Bring Me Home and The Safest Place were the ones that I considered a little bland because they sounded too much a like for my taste.  They just didn't do it for me.  I wanted to skip through them, but I wanted to give each song their fair play so I sat through them. They are definitely not my favorite but someone else may think otherwise.<br /><br />My favorite song on the album so far is Babyfather because it is uptempo and sounds a little like Reggae.  The song Be That Easy has a jazzy/blues feel to it. I like how the whistling came in at the end.<br /><br />My top 5 favorites are:<br /><br />1.) Babyfather<br />2.) In Another Time<br />3.) Soldier of Love<br />4.) The Moon and The Sky<br />5.) Skin<br /><br />This will probably be one of those albums that you either hate or love.  If you are use to what Sade has come out with in the past then you may not completely like this album.  It is a little different.  I have all her albums and the band's sound on this album is much different but I like it.

B002ZBT84G|4.0|It's been quite some time now since Gil Scott-Heron's last record ([[ASIN:B000000GRC Spirits]]) came out, long enough to make me question, between the inactivity of recording and his recent legal problems, whether or not Scott-Heron, whose political activist voice we so desperately missed during the Bush presidency, would ever return.  Featuring a modern vibe from producer Richard Russell, Scott-Heron mixes blues covers, originals and spoken word pieces to great effect-- passionate to the point of painful, disarming in its honesty and at times fierce.  In fact, if there was a criticism to make, it's that the record is brief (around 30 minutes).  But brief as it may be, \\"I'm New Here\\" is a powerful record, and certainly one we've been waiting for.    The album has that feel of exorcism to it, whether it's the demons of stereotype (\\"On Coming From a Broken Home\\") or those more recent (the title track).  Sparse instrumentation in a highly modern context-- more modern than you think an elder statesman of music like Scott-Heron could pull off, provide a backdrop for his world weary voice, having lost some of its smooth delivery but still capable of summoning extraordinary depth of emotion.  I never thought I'd hear anyone match the haunted Robert Johnson, but Scott-Heron takes on the blues great on \\"Me and the Devil\\" and matches him.  Likewise, he expresses a pragmatic tenderness on \\"I'll Take Care of You\\" and an odd regretfulness on \\"Running\\".    Something stops me from thinking of this like Scott-Heron's masterpieces of old-- maybe its the lack of political commentary, maybe it's the lack of explosive joy that his previous records all seemed to have-- there's no \\"Red, Black & Green\\" or \\"Your Daddy Loves You\\" or \\"B-Movie\\" on this one.  But look, it's hard to speak of what could have been on an album I never expected to see.  It's a great record on its own merits.  Highly recommended.
0307269760|5.0|Munro lives up to her reputation as the best contemporary writer of short fiction in North America.  A writer of fiction myself, I regard her as a kind of guru.  I marvel at the economy, subtlety, and ease with which her fictions unfold. In Too Much Happiness, the choice and placement of stories keeps the collection's protagonist in the reader's awareness, even when she has only a walk-on part or when her husband is the focal character of a story.  The effect of that is a layering of views and voices that cumulatively expands the reader's sense of the place and space in which the protagonist emerges and the emergence itself -- like watching a picture develop on a photo paper in a tray of developer fluid.  What I am calling \\"the larger story\\" is a mostly unspoken revelation of the many dimensions of the central character, who gradually turns out to be the protagonist of the collection.  But looked at another way, the larger story is better thought of as the drama of the central character's becoming fully alive in the reader's imagination -- an exquisite revelation.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My family has played with Blokus since we bought it for Christmas.  It is a game that all ages can play.  Our 6 year old grandson picked up on it right away and his three year old sister plays very well with just a little assistance.  It is also a great grownup game as my husband and I play often.
1584282584|5.0|Neil is not only an awesome photographer but the undisputed king of onboard flash and the master of the BFT (black foamie thing).

Filled with awesome shots and technical detail.  Highly recommend!
6304884419|5.0|A \\"Bronx Tale\\" is more than just a mob movie. It tells a complete story of growing up in a Bronx neighborhood during the 50's and 60's, and the choices different ethnic backgrounds are forced to make. A great cast combined with a great soundtrack,and location shooting make this a must have film.

B002BW7A58|4.0|I know that a lot of people took the perspective of \\"This is a rock album\\" which Lil' Wayne stated but it's obviously not that.  It's certainly a hip hop record with rock influences.  I love the album.  I ride around rocking it and I would say that 9 of the songs on the album are awesome.  I cannot get enough of this album.    The only thing that pisses me off, not only with this album, is the fact that you buy a CD to support an artist and then they come out with a deluxe album a week after the release.  It's like you get punished for supporting the artist on the day their album comes out.  I'm getting pretty tired of this and will certainly hold off on all albums now which will affect first, second, and third week sales if anyone is thinking like me.    Of course I didn't let this affect my review.  I actually would have given it 4.5 stars if able.    Chris Elliott
B002Q0F6V0|5.0|\\"There's no going back - To the place - We started from\\" ...    Black Gives Way to Blue is more than just a comeback album; it's a journey through all the emotions the band went through since Staley took his own life in 2002.  It's a tribute to Staley and a statement of the bands transition into the new era of AIC without him.  Through this tragedy their energy all comes together to make in my opinion the best AIC album ever.      The album definitely has the AIC sound, but has moved forward and might be called a little more mainstream rock than their alternative roots.  I've been an AIC fan since the beginning, and like most I had my doubts about a comeback album, but after the first listen my mind was changed.  Since then I have listened to it many times and I find the songs so good they haunt me for days after.  What probably impresses me the most is the strength of the vocals on this album and the way the band stayed true to the original sound.    Here is my take on the album tracks:    1) All Secrets Known - If you listen to just one track, listen to this one. It has the classic AIC riffs and strong guitars along with a strong message that they are back and ready to move on.  \\"Hope, a New Beginning\\" is the opening line.  It sets the tone for the rest of this album and all future AIC tracks.  My favorite track.    2) Check My Brain - A great opening riff that carries through the song, this song has a mainstream rock feel to it.  I think it reflects the anguish and anger the band was going through. A great song.    3) Last of My Kind - Another classic hard riff song.  There is a chorus that reminds me of Rob Zombie's sound.  I like it very much.  Describes the bands journey out of depression.    4) Your Decision - Acoustical guitar opening and strong vocals dominate this track which reminds me of Bon Jovi.  A good song but not my favorite on the album but is very strong lyrically, you can hear them playing this one to Layne.       5) A Looking in View - \\"It's whyyou tell never tell me what's on your mind\\".  Back to strong riffs and hard sound.  Parts of this track sounds like early Scott Stapp from Creed.  Again you can hear the emotion in this song, as if they were singing to Layne.  At over 7 minutes, it's the longest track on the album.  I love this song.    6) When the Sun Rose Again - A slower acoustic piece with vocal harmony.  On its own it would not be impressive, but as part of the whole, it fits perfectly.  A message of hope and recovery.    7) Acid Bubble - then back to heavy bass line and classic hard sound.  Awesome.  \\"You never paid attention to all the lines I crossed\\" - I think the band is trying to understand and tell what Staley was going through.  A very powerful song, guitars are perfect, second longest song on the album.  Love it.    8) Lessons Learned - A good solid rock song with great vocals.  \\"In your darkest hour, you strike gold\\" - all about moving on.  I like it very much.     9) Take Her Out - Strong guitar and drum riff on this track.  Hypnotic chorus that gets stuck in your head for days.  Great track but I'm still trying to figure how it fits in with the other tracks on this album.      10) Private Hell - This song has a strong Staley like sound and awesome guitars.  A very emotional song, not sure if it it's about Staley or their journey since he left.  Again haunting sound that sticks with you.  Love this track.      11) Black Gives Way to Blue - \\"Lay down, black gives way to blue. Lay down, I'll remember you\\".  This title track is hard for me to listen to.  Not because it is slow (which it is - strong vocal and piano dominate the track), but the lyrics are very emotional.  It's an ode to Staley and moving on.  Excellent end to the story or this album.
B00330UFQS|3.0|I was introduced to Lady Antebellum by my sister, who is not a country music fan at all, but likes this group.  I love every song on their first album, and was looking forward to the release of \\"Need You Now.\\"  I bought this album from Amazon MP3 for $4 the day it was released.  Even though I was not impressed after hearing the samples, I thought it would not be too big a waste of money if I didn't like it.  This album is not as good as Lady Antebellum's first album, but it has some good songs.  I was not impressed at first, but it is starting to grow on me.  Give it a few weeks, and I might rate it even higher.  My favorites are Our Kind of Love, Perfect Day, When You Got a Good Thing, and Something Bout a Woman.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|I still can't figure out how come after years of disappointing, mind numbing sci-fi movies ( Star Wars new series included), here come District 9 and Moon made almost at the same time!<br />If you are a fan of washed out big budget blockbusters, this is not a movie you will enjoy.<br />If you are looking for an intriguing, thought provoking, well acted, spooky sci-fi you will be delighted!
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Love the music.  Have seen the movie 21 times and am to the point where I listen for the music in the background so when I listen to it in the car I can picture what part of the movie goes with it.  Can you spell OBSSESSED?

B0002W4SWC|5.0|I will start with the fact that I have not read the book.  I understand from some of the fans who love the book, that the movie is a dissapointment.    I love love love this movie.  Bridget is a funny, quirky, endearing girl and she just wants love.  Our villain (the oh so fabulous Hugh Grant) is wonderful in this.  He is charming while being slimey and you understand his motives in the end.  Our hero, oh wait, let me emphasize that - OUR HERO, Mark Darcy played by Colin Firth is perfectly cast.      He actually is doing a version of Mr. Darcy (which he so wonderfully played in Pride & Prejudice), set in modern day England.  He is a stodgy, boring lawyer who eventually falls for the charms of our gal Bridget and they fall in love.      This movie is funny, sweet, romantic and most of us girls with a few extra pounds love that Bridget is unapologetic for it.  We love her and this movie.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This is truly a wonderful story. Nicholas Sparks is a master storyteller. Dear John is positively captivating. It's heartfelt, realistic and bittersweet. The ending was surprising, but fitting. The absolute tale of what anyone that loves, truly loves someone would do. I highly recommend- just as good as A Walk to Remember!
B002ONC9NC|4.0|Life is hard when you're sixteen and smarter than most of the people around you, especially when those people include your parents. You end up restless and bored much of the time and that, in combination with hormones, can cause you to sometimes do some very, very stupid things.    That's the situation Jenny (Oscar-nominated Carey Mulligan, best known to me from her role as Sally Sparrow), is in in An Education, the Oscar-nominated movie from director Lone Scherfig and writer Nick Hornby (known for such works as About a Boy. Watch it and realize that pudgy little boy grew up to be, oh, quite lovely). She's very much fed up with her life and when she meets an older man, David (played by the always reliable Peter Sarsgaard), who gives her the respect and attention no one else does.    From the start it's pretty clear what David wants from her, and it's quite clear Jenny is at least somewhat aware of this. She seems to be willing to go along with that in return for the gifts, the activities and a chance to be around people who are more \\"her sort\\".    David is a charming fellow, even able to get Jenny's parents to accept him and allow her to do things like accompany him to Oxford or Paris. Her father (played by the always reliable Alfred Molina), appears to be completely snowed. Her mother less so, though she's still willing to let her daughter go off with this man in his 30's.    David's charms are somewhat undone when Jenny finds out the various ways he makes a living, which include, but are not limited to, stealing valuable art from old women. Surprisingly, she's willing to go along with this, but eventually finds out something even more dark and unpleasant about David.    The film is intelligent and entertaining and paints David in a surprisingly sympathetic light until towards the very end. I say \\"surprisingly\\" because do let's remember Jenny is a minor and what he does with her is what's described as \\"statutory rape\\" in many places and is even called \\"rape of a child\\" in others. Of course this fact isn't really addressed, but it was always there in the back of my mind.    I also found the character of Jenny to be delightful! Very smart, very charismatic, but also vulnerable and not quite as world-weary as she likes to think of herself as being. Her character, and indeed the entire story, is based on a memoir by journalist Lynn Barber. If there's more about Barber's life that she can turn into stories, I'd enjoy that. I'd like to see Jenny again.    It's somewhat hard to classify this movie. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama. It's certainly not a romantic comedy. It probably fits into that tired non-genre genre of \\"coming of age\\". I think I'll settle for just calling it \\"very good\\" and leave it at that.

B000005IZ8|5.0|I ordered this copy of the sound track to Powaqqatsi because my original was worn out.  I saw the film when it was first released way back when and the DVD is regular viewing in my household.  The Penguin CD guide states that the Stuttgart Opera recording of Glass's Opera Akhenaten contains some of the most powerfull music ever recorded... Powaqqatsi rivals this.  If you like Glass and World music, you will not be dissapointed in Powaqqatsi.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game as a gift for my brother, who has always loved strategy board games.  We have only played once, and it was just a standard \\"practice game\\" but we had fun, and I think it has great potential!  I am looking forward to playing this game again!
0547258305|4.0|I thought that this was a very entertaining fantasy novel - the characters were quite likable and the plot, though straightforward, was exciting. I am looking forward to reading the sequel, as well as the rest of the series. It really reminded me of Maria V. Snyder's series, so I would say that if you finished that series and were looking for a new fantasy series, you would probably really enjoy this one since they both center around strong, independent, female characters.

0743437497|5.0|If you've seen the movie, but never read the book, you are cheating yourself.     The book painstakingly reminds the reader that Jack is an \\"okay\\" guy for the most part. Sure, he screwed up a lot in the past, but he's doing his best to rise above it and save his family.     Unfortunately when he gets to the hotel, he slowly becomes its victim. It twists his mind and fools him into thinking that his family is against him.    Sure, the movie was great, but it was a poor translation of a great novel and the inner workings of Jack Torrence's poor twisted mind.

0439023483|5.0|This is a very good book, and very inspirational for young women. It is written for young adults and teenagers.  The main character Katniss is a strong feminine heroin.    The story is told from Katniss's point of view and the reader is really able to imagine the world through her eyes. Katniss is a 17 year old girl living with her mother and a fragile twelve-year-old sister in District 12. Her father was killed in a coal mining accident several years ago, and now Katniss must be the sole provider for her family. She feeds her family by risking her life on a daily basis, hunting illegally in the woods beyond the wire fence that keeps residents from escaping from the District.       Katniss must choose between life, love, and loyalty in a story that makes you question our views of modern entertainment and society.  Katniss is the warrior that every young woman should strive to be. She is very strong spirit who through circumstances beyond her control must rise to the challenges of a harsh life. Not falling back into a state of weakness, but reaching deep within her self to find the will to survive, and by doing so, she shows the reader the true strength and beauty of the feminine human spirit.
B00005TT77|5.0|I was skeptical of this soundtrack because most people don't do very well with remaking songs, especially songs of great artsits such as the beatles. I've not seen the movie yet but I LOVE the soundtrack.
B000002UB3|5.0|Not that this album needs any introduction... It's a timeless classic and listening to it allows you to discover new things in these songs every time you play it. It's hard to believe this music came out when it did, it sounds way ahead of its time. This issue is excellent sonically, with all the details there, good dynamics and relatively free of \\"digititis\\" (although of course if you are lucky enough to have this on good vinyl that remains the standard). Highly recommended.

0061703257|5.0|This was my first Lehane novel and I wanted to read it because Scorsese deemed the story good enough to turn into a movie.  I must say, not only was this a good read, but a well-crafted, suspenseful story, filled with great setting descriptions, characters and plot.<br /><br />Lehane did his homework and research.  Although a lot of what goes on in Shutter Island comes off as surreal and outright spooky at times, Lehane pulls it off in a way that makes it all believable.  Every detail of this story artfully builds to quite a satisfying climax.<br /><br />None of the scenes are overdone and there are few dull moments.  The length of this novel is also just right.  Lehane is a great storyteller. I look forward to reading more of his novels and I can't wait to watch Scorsese's adaptation of this book on film

6304712936|4.0|I was reminded of the Amadeus movie that I had watched once when it came out in 1984. I wanted to view it again and could not find it at a rental facility. I didn't know if it would still be available and what it would cost to purchase the DVD version. I located a used DVD at a very good price and ordered through Amazon.com. The DVD was shipped and billed from another source, as promised, with a very fast delivery time, and at the ordered price. I was very satisified with the arrangements and enjoyed watching the movie again.  [[ASIN:6304712936 Amadeus]]
B002YIHO7I|2.0|See my title above for what this album really should have been called. I gave it two to help drag it down, it's arguably a three star record, but it gets a two for Amazon's sake.    I have been a huge Sade fan and - unlike some on here - REALLY did dig Lovers Rock - it was daring, it was emotional in a NEW way (not just more \\"I inadvertently and embarassingly mothered much of smooth jazz with far, far superior material that just happened to have slick groove.\\")    It was a killer, daring, brave, bold record, alienating to some and a pleasing revelation of depth to others.     That said, this album is (with the exception of the more-prominent drum machine and a slightly peppier pace on a few songs, and of course the closest thing to \\"sunny\\" on here - Babyfather) and forever will be \\"Lovers Rock II: Electric Boogaloo.\\"     The more insistent, bold, direction-changing flame on Lovers Rock has simply been dragged down the road in a zipped suitcase for ten years, and been unpacked, kinda wrinkled and stale. That flame now looks like the pilot light on an old water heater...small and a little underpowered.    Anyhow, this to me handily takes the \\"worst Sade outing\\" mantle.    - Matt
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I tend to buy these types of gadgets on a whim but I read the reviews and was fairly satisfied that I would be getting a decent GPS watch.  My previous Garmin was so ridiculously large that I have only worn it on two occasions.  Hopefully I can find a man who would like to buy it from me.      Here are my initial thoughts after spending about 20 minutes trying to fix my settings.    - Garmin, please employ some talented female engineers so that you can design something that fits a WOMAN'S wrist.  Did you know that women are quickly becoming the majority gender at races?  We have tiny wrists (my wrist circumference is only 5 1/2 inches), and big hunks of hard plastic and ugly wrist bands do not fit well, nor are they very comfortable.  Either make a woman's watch or design something more flexible!!!    - Take a cue from Apple and design a GPS watch that is intuitive and easy to use even without the manual.  I wanted to throw my watch against the wall when I first started setting it up, and I wondered why the hell I spent $400 on something that sucked out of the box.    I'm taking the watch out for a spin tomorrow (regular run & intervals) so we'll see how it actually works and feels.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is a wonderful movie which I feel must not have received nearly enough publicity when it came out, as I didn't hear about it until two years later. It has stunning visuals, which alone makes the movie worth it for anyone who enjoys good photography or art. It also has an intriguing surrealist story which is fun to try and piece together. The emotions conveyed by the movie are very strong, and it is an experience to watch.     A caution, though: this movie is best when watched in the right mood. It is not extremely fast paced, and requires a measure of patience and willingness to sit back and enjoy the spectacle.
B00319ECHE|3.0|After a large mess and FF being set aside the disc shows it. It's ok, but the same old FF without Chritian and it shows. There is no twist or track that stands out. Sad to say I'm not impressed. It doesn't hold the fire to get your frustrations out as in the past. The lyrics are about basically nothing; Burton is loosing his edge. Good if your a past FF fan and want some background noise to read a book to. If just now being introduced to FF try the previous discs 1st...

Would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone that has a baby.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Our family plays this game with two of the regular games and two 5-6 player extensions. We have also played these two-box games with two additional Seafarers extension. In addition, the game can be played and enjoyed by all the members of your family from around 10 years old up to old (like I am!). The game is easy to learn, and the winner is determined by about 40% luck (dice and card draws) and about 60% strategy. We also have fun setting up the game free style, with the land and sea markers randomly arranged into continents and islands by someone who will be playing the game. These larger games can go on for as long as three hours, though most last about two. Great fun and highly recommended!

0670019925|1.0|As a hearing impaired person, I was struck by two things about this novel: (1) the accurate detail that describes the every day ubiquitous problems that a person with serious hearing impairment faces, and (2) how utterly boring this book was. I struggle through to page 66 and quit, setting this book on a pile that I call \\"Discard as soon as possible.\\"
B002JVWR4U|3.0|While the final episode in the series, \\"Epitaph 2\\", addresses the events and issues raised in the final DVD episode of Season 1 (\\"Epitaph One\\"), many sacrifices to the show's artistic integrity had to (unfortunately) be made.  This was the right choice for the show: to end with a plot that makes sense.  But, it's likely that more seasons would have been required to flesh out this plot outline with a style, finesse, emotional impact, and insight that simply couldn't be done on this short timeline, certainly not with an eye toward care for the characters or themes we'd seen in the first season.  For those who loved season 1, this season was certainly entertaining, but the visions for potential greatness you may have had for season 2 are unlikely to be borne out.  (That being said, there were small moments that were incredible - anything involving Amy Acker in the beginning of the season, for example!)  The pacing of this season was reminiscent of the final season of ALIAS - hurried and plot-driven.  I'm glad that the season was made to wrap up loose ends, but the heart of this series will always remain with the second half of Season 1.        Note: this review is for the show itself, will update review to include product specifics once it is released.

Prog Rock is ever evolving and the current influence of \\"metal\\" if done with \\"restraint\\" is a wonderful thing indeed.  Tightly Unwound is a tribute to its past Prog Rock roots with the influence of Prog Metal.  It begins with a wonderfully soft, mellow acoustic song and proceeds to build in intensity and complexity as any great Prog album should.  Ever aspect of this album is a joy - music and lyrics will keep you rivited to your speakers and as with all great Prog albums the more you listen the better it gets.  If you are a fan of porcupine tree you will love this album

B0033807C2|5.0|This is awesome. Full of action and humor, as always. Percy finally fulfills the prophecy, and Rachel embraces her calling. That was kind of unexpected. Also, the use of more Greek myths was awesome. I'm kind of disappointed, though. Is that it for Pervy and Annabeth? That wasn't very romantic. However, the end of the book suggests a new series. I'm eagerly awaitng its arrival, and I do hope that it will still be about Pervy and Annabeth. Please, Mr. Riordan, don't add anymore children of the Big Three. It's been an awesome journey with Percy. Though the whole &#34;last Olympian&#34; thing was kind of a let down. I was expecting something more. But, hey, it was fantastic. Awesome!

B002SJIO54|4.0|It's strange to call a science-fiction thriller eerily captivating, but first-time feature director Neill Blomkamp has somehow managed to earn that description with a most unexpected twist on the alien invasion genre of films. Based on a six-minute short, \\"Alive in Joburg\\", he made back in 2005, director/co-screenwriter Neill Blomkamp has fashioned a propulsive, corking adventure film that manages to be a thoughtful allegory on xenophobia, corporate greed, and due to its South African location, apartheid. What is most fascinating about the screenplay co-written by Terri Tatchell is that the aliens are not positioned to the viewer as an unknown force ready to destroy mankind, as is usually the case, but rather as an escalating socio-political \\"situation\\" to which the South African government respond by assigning a multinational corporation to transport them from a ramshackle, inner-city shantytown called District 9 to another area outside of Johannesburg.<br /><br />Turning our expectations upside down, Blomkamp reveals an obviously powerful alien species rendered helpless on earth by their refugee status and relegated to criminal acts. In mock-documentary style, the story begins with a series of interviews explaining the back story for the aliens. A gigantic spaceship hovers over Johannesburg in 1982 (shades of Roland Emmerich's 1996 [[ASIN:B00005V9IK Independence Day]]) where an exploratory team discovers over a million malnourished aliens onboard without a leader. They are tall bipeds with insect-like faces and crustacean-like bodies (looking very much like Jeff Goldblum's fully transformed title character in David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of [[ASIN:B0009X768W The Fly]]). Over the next two decades, the aliens conform to their squalid surroundings and engage in destructive behavior that raises the ire of the local residents who call them derogatorily \\"prawns\\". An officious Afrikaan field operative named Wikus Van De Merwe has been assigned the unenviable task of serving eviction notices to the aliens and confiscating their weaponry.<br /><br />On one particular raid, Van De Merwe inadvertently sprays himself with a mysterious liquid that mutates his DNA to take on alien characteristics. He is shunted to District 9 where he relies on a more thoughtful alien named Christopher Johnson to help him reverse the transformation process. Before that can happen, the multinational corporation wants Van De Merwe for his new-found ability to handle alien weaponry (which humans cannot operate). There is also trouble brewing with Nigerian gangs eventually leading to a violent melee that decides the fate of not only Van De Merwe but also the aliens on earth. Blomkamp decided to cast a first-time feature actor, Sharlto Copley, as Van De Merwe, and he is quite effective in the role. At first, he appears to be a geeky corporate lackey married to the boss's daughter and intent on carrying forth his undesirable mission with little trepidation. Copley manages to show his character's arc in not only the manifestation of graphic effects but also through the sinking dejection he experiences as an evolving alien.<br /><br />All the aliens are CGI-generated, and kudos belong to the visual effects team headed by Dan Kaufman, Peter Muyzers, Robert Habros, and Matt Aitken for giving them a scarifying look to contrast their increasingly vulnerable state. Make no mistake that despite the film's grander statements regarding the detrimental impact of social segregation, it turns primarily into a man-on-the-run (or should I say \\"alien-on-the-run\\") B-style thriller with eye-wincing horror elements. There is a robust set of extras with the two-disc 2010 DVD set. The first disc contains 25 minutes of deleted scenes, a strong making-of documentary, and an engaging commentary track from Blomkamp. The second disc is on the light side, offering four featurettes which detail various aspects of the production, but unfortunately, there is no sign of the original short,\\"Alive in Joburg\\".

0545140315|4.0|The Lonely Hearts Club was so addicting! I finished it in about a day, and then I gave it to my friend who finished it in a day. Elizabeth Eulberg is a debut author, and a wonderful one at that. I love that she chose The Beatles to write about. They are a really safe subject, that most people seem to love. Penny Lane was a wonderful character. The transformation she makes throughout the book is amazing.<br />After reading this, all I wanted to do was listen to The Beatles. I found it hilarious that the main character and all her sisters had names relating to The Beatles, yet, her parents names are totally average.<br />Elizabeth Eulberg did an amazing job writing this, I liked it more than I expected to and it is definitely a book I will remember.

B003102JDM|1.0|I have enjoyed every one of the Coen brothers movies, and can sit through just about anything (as this movie once again proved), but this is surely a misfire and I have no idea why this is so highly rated.  All style and no substance, they have taken the approach that way less is more and this movie is the equivalent of watching paint dry.  And then, for good measure, it pulls an oh so artistic ending a-la \\"The Sopranos\\" which leaves you feeling kicked in the gut.  You'll never get this hour and a half back.  \\"The Shipping News\\" for me will always be the worse movie ever made, but this one is close to being the worse of the decade.  Please spare me the \\"you just didn't get it, it's so profound\\" bull.  Whatever existential meaning this carries could have been conveyed on a postage stamp.  I'm just warning you that haven't seen it yet, you may feel enlighted and self important for choosing this one, but you'll hate yourself later.
B0002CHIJW|3.0|I'll keep it simple. This is a hard movie to watch; however, it was a really well made movie. The rape scenes are so realistic, that at times I felt like I was going to be sick. Despite that, the film really draws you in and by the time the woman takes her revenge, your right there with her cheering her on. I only wish her revenge could have been more brutal. Yeah sure, in one scene she removes a guys you no what, however after those rape scenes I think more torture is deserved. WARNING, this movie is not for everyone.
0786178485|5.0|I bought this product as a gift for my mom for Christmas, who loves Jane Austin books. For some audio books, the narrator is boring and drones on and on. Or, they put to much dynamism into their read-aloud, making their story seems over dramatic and almost comical if it wasn't so disappointing. This was not the case for this product. The female narrator reads all of the character's dialogue, but in a way that is easy to listen to. She doesn't overemphasize, nor is she monotone. It's the perfect companion if you are taking a long drive alone, which my mom often does. I recommend this product 100%.
B00005JLKB|5.0|My fiance and I went thru this season in 2 weeks! We  hurried to watch the second season and have just ordered the 3rd,...... it's addicting!
B002WY65VU|5.0|I am not really a huge fan of zombie movies, but this movie looked really funny and I needed a good laugh. This movie delivered. So funny. The casting was awesome and the plot was funny with enough gore to call itself a zombie movie. Loved it! Now this movie is one of my favorites.
B002AT4K9G|3.0|The service I got when ordering this movie was great. It was affordable and I got it quick. The movie itself however was not for me. I bought it for my boyfriend who is a Fast & Furious fan and needed the newest to complete his set. Therefore I cannot really rate this movie.

0893860220|5.0|BOOK BY SRI NISARGADATTA CAME TO MY ATTENTION AT THE RIGHT TIME OF MY LIFE. THE FORMAT OF QUESTION & ANSWERS IS  EXCELLENT . TO GET GOOD ANSWERS YOU MUST POSE A GOOD QUESTION & THAT HAS DEFINITELY BEEN DONE . I AM MORE THAN HALF WAY THROUGH THE BOOK & QUESTIONS SEEM TO BE FOLLOWING THE RIGHT PATH OF PROGRESSION. IT IS A GOOD BOOK TO READ FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS TRAVELLED ON THE ROAD TO SPIRITUALITY BUT STILL HAS SOME QUESTIONS . SRI NISARGADATTA WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Another odd story line with a lot of action. If you like Indiana Jones, you'll like this.
1400063515|3.0|I would say most of this book was just long winded.  There is a lot of talking that doesn't do anything than to distract from the original point and almost make you forget what the author was talking about.  But the central points of the book.... when the author gets to them are really good.  The bell curve is a disaster in the social sciences and any field that moves, but the author spends more time complaining about \\"he said she said\\" sorts of things instead of getting down to the nuts and bolts of the problem.  This leaves his message unclear and painful to get to with all the unnecessary writing.  The book could be two chapters long, clear and concise...and so much better.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Most breathtaking glimpse of the planet we live on that ive ever seen. Anyone who is on the fence about purchasing this series should just go for it. You will not be disappointed. Give it to a young person who is interested in science or animals or to anyone who would like to to be blown away by some of the most beautiful and technically advance cinematography to date. The behind-the-scene featurettes at the end of each episode I found especially interesting.
0345457692|4.0|As a kid, I abolutely loved the [[ASIN:0345331192 Robot Trilogy: The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, The Robots of Dawn]], but I always wanted the story to move along faster.  Altered Carbon reminds of this series but it's more exciting and strikes the right pace.  It's probably less philosophical, but it makes up for it with gravitas.  Great sci-fi noir.
B000002ADT|5.0|I guess this is my first true jazz album. I really enjoy it. MILES DAVIS was really a JAZZ originator and master.
0439023483|4.0|The first comment I'm going to make about this book is that if you're intrigued by the synopsis you should definitely read the book. It took me only 2 days to read because from the opening chapter I didn't want to put the book down. It was well written, the characters were well developed and the story just grabbed my imagination.     I'm not going to waste time with an elaborate description of the story because I'm guessing you've already read it somewhere else. But I will say that the hopelessness of the situation the main character, Katniss, is in really grabbed me. Here's a 16 year old girl who gets thrust into these games where there is virtually no chance of her getting out alive. She's going to a place where there are 23 other competitors who viscously want to kill her because its the only chance at survival. The quality of the writing actually made me anxious myself because I could just imagine being in her shoes. And when the author stuck to the story of Katniss trying to survive the book continued to be intriguing.    The one area of this book that fell short was the subplot between Katniss and the supporting character Peeta. Suzanne Collins tried to add too much of a romantic storyline to a survivalist story and she didn't balance it very well. The result was that it took the anxiety of the situation away, I stopped worrying about the fact that the main character was being hunted by desperate teenagers, many of whom were enjoying themselves. This led to the ending of the book being a bit of a disappointment mainly because the feeling of desperation left me a number of chapters before.    The majority of the book in my opinion was excellent and I have eagerly started reading Book 2 in the trilogy. I'm hoping Collins can bring back the powerful emotions that the first book created but failed to sustain. But like I said at the beginning, if you read the synopsis and were intrigued, definitely read this book.
0446560065|5.0|Great book, with tons of impecable quality drawings with no text. It's a must-have for any Simon's Cat fan!
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|For someone who loves romantic movies, this movie certainly delivers. I loved it, I simply loved it and I can't say it any clearer than that. I wanted to feel good, I wanted to feel joyful, I wanted to feel that magical something that I can't really explain and this movie gave it to me. The plot, the actors, the music, the journey is just right for me.     Here it is nearly 1:00 a.m. and I am so alert. Really I feel energized with that kind of \\"you can do it\\" energy. I love when a movie gives me something positive. It's like a sort of nourishment.     I've just finished watching this movie and I feel like I can watch it all over again. I am uplifted, energized, hopeful, creative, and just filled with something that is inspiring and encouraging. For some, what I say will sound hokey or whatever, but hokey people like me love this kind of movie. The kind that is alright to share with the entire family. Gosh, did this movie make me feel great. I simply loved it.
B00365YVRO|5.0|It is nice to see her come back and the album is great while it has a few fillers the hits outweigh them all! It has been so long since I have heard her and really didn't realize how much of a talent she is and how much her music was missed!
B002WCLG3O|1.0|HALO done in Anime -- FAIL!    I will stick with the games.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Invictus is one of the most effective movies on leadership that I have seen.  Nelson Mandella used his 9,000 days as a political prisoner to develop his character, so that he was ready to unify a deeply divided country as the first black president of South Africa.  He was able to honor his own people, without turning the tables on white South Africans.  I treasure Mandella's modeling of the ability to hold all of those realities at once.  That's my idea of a great leader and I found Invictus to be deeply moving.
B000ZELISO|4.0|Good movie; although you can notice they are stretching the story and making it darker.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This is one of the best tv series.  This show isnt a pro-drug propaganda piece, it shows the downsides to narcotics and what can happen when even the most honest people become desparate.  Very funny and entertaining.  I can't wait for the third season!!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|This was a Christmas gift and seller got it to me in really good condition and at a very fast delivery.

B001G9LVGG|5.0|Item # B001G9LVGG  A Midwinter Night's Dream<br /><br />Some of these songs are completely new to me, but I fell in love with them immediately.<br /><br />\\"Seeds of Love\\"<br />\\"Gloucestershire Wassail\\"<br />\\"Noel Nouvelet\\"<br />\\"Snow\\"<br />\\"The Seven Rejoices of Mary\\"<br /><br />Like all the rest of the album, these each conform to an Loreena Mckennitt experience, classical instruments, sacred chorus choir, her clear sweet voice ringing out between the trickling stream of a fluent harp.  The Abdelli Version of God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen would be considered a belly-dancing rhythm, I believe.<br /><br />Some of my old favorites are performed in a way I've never heard them before, and likely a more authentic flavor beside their origins in medieval Europe.<br />\\"The Holly & The Ivy\\"<br />\\"Emmanuel\\"<br />\\"Coventry Carol\\"<br />\\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" (instrumental)<br />\\"Good King Wenceslas\\"<br /><br />If you enjoy the story of Good King Wenceslas, she has a way of telling it that I'd rate as valuable enough to justify all the songs together.  But then, to some people, a harper is not merely an entertainer.  }:-)
0446567329|5.0|I was very surprised when I read this book just how good it was.  I was totally engrossed in the tale of these two people. It is not your usual romance novel. There is a sensitivity that the author uses to unveil his characters slowly that I don't usually see in romantic novels. This just goes far beyond and is an interesting tale to read with many tangents that are equally interesting.  I can see why they have made a movie of this book, but it is hard to imagine that a movie could give the subtleties of this book what it deserves.  I will be interested to see the movie. However, if I don't, I am very happy with having read this and would love to read more of this author's work.  I believe this is my first book written by him. I am sold on him !
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie really looks great on blu-ray.  You can immediately see how the resolution and clarity of this movie shines.  I've seen this movie at the theater, on dvd and now on blu-ray.  I prefer the blu-ray version as it looks simply the best and the sound is also very good.      Regarding the movie, it's one of the best star treks yet, as of late the next generation movies were becoming more and more like normal episodes of the tv show and you had to really know who the characters were.  I think this put off many viewers since they simply did not keep up to date with the show.  It's too bad I loved the next generation shows/movies but they really were getting old.    Many hard core trekkies hate what they did to the history of trek but they needed a fresh start and this really was a good opportunity to change things around.  Atleast now the stories can live on with new movies.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This movie held my interest throughout. The setting was authentic, no fancy bells or whistles in the form of special effects, but very effective nonetheless!  Not your typical run of the mill Vamp Flick....Highly recommend!!!  Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Great item!  I'm sorry that it took so long to leave you positive feedback.  You are a great seller!  Thank you so much!!
B002YIHO7I|5.0|It takes a few listens of a CD to get to the know the songs, so after about 10 listens, I am now ready to rate the songs on this album:    Songs I rate 5-stars:    The Moon and the Sky  Soldier of Love  Babyfather  Be That Easy  Bring Me Home  In Another Time    Songs I rate 4-stars:    Morning Bird  Long Hard Road  Skin  The Safest Place    Songs I rate 3, 2, or 1 star:    n/a    Overall rating 5:  I believe if some of the other reviewers had waited until they listened a few more times, more would have rated this album 5 stars.      Conclusion:  Another brilliant album from Sade!!!
B000WGWQG8|1.0|Great movie. The problem was that I ordered the disc set off of Amazon and the first cd was scratched up so bad that the movie never functioned once w/o having skipping & disc issues.

B0000029LG|3.0|I ordered this as a result of listening to [...].  The song titles looked great.  As I listen to the CD I realize I'm not that familiar with a lot of the songs.  The CD case keeps falling apart.[[ASIN:B0000029LG HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]
B002ZIAC26|5.0|These tunes can put you in a trance like state, there is a hypnotic wave flowing through them, likely due to the hushed vocals and constant subtle bass riffs in the background. This band is very talented and chose an ironic name in 'Beach House', instead the songs conjure up a dark night in a nice high rise apartment deep in a sprawling city jungle, with ambient lights on low.
B00005QGAT|5.0|This album gives you a first taste of MJ's sound and soul as a solo artist.    I decided to buy the \\"cd\\" version of this because my cassette is coming apart :( haha.    But yes...every MJ fan must have this.    RIP MJ :)
0451228731|5.0|Excellent glimpse into what the future could hold. Also a great platform for ideas about resilient communities.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|This band gets into your blood and the more listens it gets better and better and better!  They are constantly experimenting with their music since the band started recording back 1991.  If you like PT this will be a must have for your collection by this wonderful band!  What will Steven Wilson create next? Musically he his in a league of his own!
0810993139|1.0|Apparently this book turns around at some point, but the beginning of the book does nothing but teach your child how to lie, cheat and steal.  Not a great book for youngsters.  This book gives kids too many ideas about how to cheat and get out of doing things they don't want to.  Kids pick up enough of that on their own, they don't need more ideas from this book.  HORRIBLE!!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|We love Fawlty Towers, and we already had the video collection from several years ago, but this new DVD set is well worth the price to get the new John Cleese commentary for each episode. Since we know the series so well that we can practically quote the dialogue as we view it, we have been watching the episodes with the Cleese commentary running. He shares some fascinating bits of information about the actors, the sets, the direction, and the background. Every time I hear him admire the young Connie Booth (his first wife, I guess!) I get the giggles!
B001AII4RM|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  The depiction of Grendel as a tragic figure who had no choice but to be as he was, and do as he did, added depth and tragedy which made the movie more accessible.  Similarly, the Fire-Dragon's vindictive sentiment and the Water Demon's sad loneliness were all elements that were not conveyed in previous film attempts.  Ray Winstone convincing as Beowulf - pompous, boastful, vulnerable, tragic, loyal, and caring.    The art style's 3D take will either wow you or annoy you.  It gives off, at first, the impression of a very very good-looking video game - but the more you watch the more you realize that this is artistic bend on live-action acting.  It grew on me the more I watched it and it allowed the director to do amazing effects seamlessly and believably.  There is a method to the madness.    The Blu-ray is nothing short of spectacular.  The video pops from the screen, color depth is good and saturated, and detail is plentiful.  The audio is amazing, with excellent surround spacing and depth as well.  The blu-ray also contains some interesting (albeit short) hi-def extras.
B000P0J0DI|4.0|no issues with the disc. The movie image however was in fair quality almost as if it was a pirated copy.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I went on to Amazon to purcahse Season 2 and found that Season 1 was such a great price I had to buy that one as well, even though we had already seen it. Will be collecting all the seasons now.

B002C6K7NU|4.0|Today's version of Lynyrd Skynyrd contains only one member from the classic group of the 70's.  The unfortunate death of keyboard player Billy Powell last year leaves only guitarist Allen Rossington as a remaining member of the band who was once the kings of southern rock.  Along with Rossington are main members vocalist Johnny Van Zandt (original vocalist Ronnie's brother), guitarist Rickey Medlocke (Blackfoot, and Skynyrd member prior to their recording debut), drummer Michael Cartellone (Damn Yankees), Ean Evans and Mark Matejka.  Billy Powell also appears on a few tracks recorded before his death.  The band's last album \\"Vicious Cycle\\" dabbled in modern day country rock and to my ears came across as a bit of a mixed bag.  On \\"God And Guns\\" Skynyrd pretty much stick to rock n roll and I think the results are better for it.   Overall this may not rank up with the band's classics, but there are several really good tunes to be found here.  The leadoff single \\"Still Unbroken\\" is a very strong track to lead off the album and deserving of the airplay the song has received.  \\"Skynyrd Nation\\" will undoubtedly open up the band's live shows on the album's tour.  \\"Floyd\\" is a great swampy southern tale, and \\"Gifted Hands\\", a tribute to the late Billy Powell, is a moving closing track with some nice duel guitar work at the end.  The rest of the album is all fairly solid as well.  The band delve a bit further into right wing southern red neck land than I normally care for in tracks like \\"God And Guns\\" and \\"That Ain't My America\\", but on the other hand the attitude is part of what makes southern rock what it is I guess.  Today's version of Skynyrd may never be able to live up to it's checkered and tragic past, but for modern southern rock this one serves it up quite impressively.
0930289234|1.0|I hated this book with a heated passion. Some of my classmates loved it, but I would have rather burned it.
B001GCUER0|5.0|We got hooked on Season 1 and had to purachase Season 2. Finished that in a few days and now waiting on Season 3. It is very interesting to see what business was like back in the 1960's.
B000000WFU|5.0|i have purchased this CD at least 3 times.  it keeps disappearing from my office!  i have been a massage therapist for 20 years and this has been a staple in my practice since it was released.  some say the repetitiveness is...well...repetitive.  i love that about it.  like chanting...i end up in a world other than our hectic ever changing, over-stimulating modern world!  i emerge from the experience refreshed, relaxed and recharged...every time.  HOW MUCH BETTER CAN IT GET?:)
B00110K62U|5.0|I am VERY HAPPY with this! It arrived VERY quickly, in EXCELLENT condition. Great price.
B000063UR1|4.0|Just saw this again for the first time since I was a kid. It was memorable because of the 3 human-like drones, or robots. And especially the ending , which made me cry and haunted me for days when I was an 8 yr old kid. I felt so sad because the last remaining drone was all alone tending to the plants, and even though he was just following orders you had the feeling he would be lonely all by himself for eternity. The final shot of Huey holding the old battered watering can is unforgettable. This was not a great movie but it was memorable, at least for me. I give it 3 1/2 stars.
B002W6Z0UK|2.0|I absolutely LOVE Lady Gaga but I was very disappointed that this CD was censored.  No where in this listing did it specify that this was a censored CD.  I am 23 years old so I think I can handle the profanity.  I would have given this 5 starts otherwise!

B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Excellent musical, I only wish I had the opportunity of seeing Julie Andrews in the role on Broadway to assess the performance of Audry Hepburn. Rex Harrison is oustanding as the professor. The actor playing \\"Liza's\\" father almost steals those scenes he appears in!

0316287059|5.0|I grew up with five brothers and never learned how to put makeup on correctly. I tried learning from Teen magazine and Vogue only to end up looking like The Bride of Dracula. I gave up until trying because I have really young looking skin and people always told me how nice my skin was. I turned 46 this year and read an article about aging skin and decided to try to figure out this make up stuff again. I went to Dillard's and asked one of the clinicians if she'd show me how to apply it to look natural. When I left there I looked just like her!  Not exactly what I was hoping for. I found Face Forward on Amazon and the reviews were good so I bought it. The book teaches you step by step, everything from face shapes to contouring and how to make your eyes look awake.......since getting this book I've actually turned heads (I am 46 years old......OMG I thought that was a thing of the past!)  I am interviewing for jobs and I feel so good knowing that I am putting my best face forward..........wonderful book!
0439882826|5.0|We lucked out and found this book at a consignment shop for 4 bucks.. OH MY GOOOOODness!  We LOVE it!!  it is incredibly detailed and has numerous pop up scenes from all the movies.. Of course my sons' favorite part is the light up pop ups with the lightsabers.  Im not sure if Id personally pay full price for this, but Id totally recommend it as a gift for any one wanting to please a young star wars fan!

1933308087|5.0|This book is inspirational and the gold standard of quilt blocks. If there is one book for the serious quilter to own, this is that one. Jinny Beyers process for looking at a block and converting it to a pattern is outstanding. The indexes and guides within the book cover just about any type pattern style I have dreamed up. This will keep me happy for years.
0743298039|4.0|Certainly an ode to her love of nineteenth century literature, Setterfield hits the mark with with her debut novel. The plot is well thought out, with a cast of interesting characters, an atmosphere that is a mixture of lush and foreboding settings, and a decent dose of mystery and intrigue to boot. Well worth a read.

1416562605|4.0|Balram Halwai, a Bangalore entrepreneur (of sorts) and a natural philosopher, hears that there is a planned visit from the Chinese leader to India to learn the source of Indian entrepreneurial talent. Balram knows that the story he will be told by the Indian leader will be a long way from the true story of modern Indian life, and so resolves, over the course of seven nights, to write to the Chinese premier with the story of his life and his own journey from a poor son of a rickshaw driver to the head of his own business.    This clever device allows first time author, Aravind Adiga, to move from the general state of India to the specifics of Balram's story. Particularly when Balram is talking about generalisations of modern day India, at his philosophical best, the results are extremely funny (I'm mystified at the reviewers here who claim to have not found any of it funny - all a matter of taste I suppose!). Like most good comedy, the humour comes from being centred in truth. The result is a painful exposé, full of anger, at the injustices, of the underbelly of Indian society. However, when he concentrates on Balram's own story, interesting though it is, I felt that less convinced by the letter to the Chinese premier device.    Balram grew up in `the Darkness' - the poor interior. He is more intelligent than most (he is described by a teacher as a `white tiger' that only appears once in a generation in the wild), but still his prospects are not great until he secures a position as a driver for the family of one of the landlords' families of his home region. Using his wits and taking any opportunity he can to promote his cause, he eventually secures the `number one driver' position affording him the opportunity to drive for one of the landlord's sons when he moves to the `Light' in Delhi.    Yet he is still very much a servant with no prospect of reaching the dizzy heights of `entrepreneur'. In order to get there, something more drastic than quick wits are needed, and it's not giving anything away to reveal that a little murder might also be called for.      The India portrayed is one of bribery, corruption and huge social injustices. I was drawn into the story from the first page and held to the end. Adiga has a wonderfully satirical style. It's more `Slumdog Millionaire' than Salman Rushdie.    `'The White Tiger'` won the Man Booker prize in 2008. In many ways it's an unusual choice for the prize. It's not an overtly literary book, but it is a very good and entertaining read. And you will be left wondering if Balram is a revolutionary idealist or really just another thug in modern India's urban battle. Is that enough to win one of the most prestigious fiction prizes? I'm not so sure. One thing I am sure about though is that for a first novel, this is highly impressive and marks Adiga out as a writer to watch.
B002WCLG3O|2.0|Ok I am not a PS3 guy that hates Halo and everything xbox.  I LOVE Halo, I really do, I read all the books, even the bad ones.  I really don't mind that the stories don't fit with the books and games because lets face it even when they say its supposed to it doesn't ie. some Spartans survive reach in First Strike but I don't get what the point of the series of shorts was about.      The first 2 retellings of the whole Halo storyline was cool and sort of a nice touch for every stoner that went straight to the multiplayer or skipped the cut scenes but the rest of the shorts are just awful. The Duel storyline flat out takes too many liberties by getting rid of the elites split jaw and making them Japanese and boring.  The rest just hit every and I mean every anime cliché in the book.  Even when there should be something cool about the short its ruined by hack unoriginal storytelling.  Prototype is a good example of this, a fun action oriented story ruined by an  intercutting story about a cold hearted guy having a heart to heart with a big softie who is a marine for some reason about him being \\"human\\" and this comes with loads and loads of quivering eye shots leading up to the predictable climax.  In other words if you've seen any anime you've seen this a dozen times, the only thing it was missing was a strained relationship with his father.      I am not against Anime there are loads of good anime and I'm not complaining about the quality of the visuals except for the short \\"the package\\" which was a sub standard CG that felt more like power rangers with the Spartans all posing and yelling \\"lets go!\\" minus that from a technical standpoint these are all well done but then Gili might have had the best lighting and sound of that year but it didn't help it.      Maybe it was just an experiment and they wanted to try something new but the whole thing really misses the mark for me.   It all feels like a knock off bought at a dollar store the writing just doesn't feel like aHalo story and leaves me feeling confused and unsatisfied.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|This show is amazing and one of the things that amazes me the most is how I can root for a serial killer to not be caught by the cops; I still am in shock why I think this. Here is a man who stocks and murders people who have done heinous crimes and then murders them for his enjoyment. Dexter works for the police department in Miami as a blood splatter analysis, he also works with his sister who is trying to be a detective. At night he stocks his prey and in the day he works crime scenes. This is a show to watch, its creative, its original and it keeps the audience engaged throughout the season. A must see, especially on blu-ray.
0307454541|4.0|I'd never heard of Larsson before, but as it turns out he really tells a good story.  The plot is easily followed but at the same time he's included some good twists and turns along the way.  Though I thought the story developed a little slowly in the beginning; personally I had to read a little longer to get to the point of being compelled to keep turning pages.  The two main characters are easy to like, whereas in contrast Larsson definitely managed to get the reader to develop the proper disdain for the dysfunctional, odious Vanger family - the evil family of Freaks.  Glad I read it.  Would definitely read his other stories.  Unfortunate for Sweden and the rest of us that Larsson met with an untimely death.
1420922572|3.0|\\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" has been called a Victorian parable, and it must have been groundbreaking in its time, but Robert Louis Stevenson seems to draw heavily on this passage from the Apostle Paul: \\"I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do...it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.\\" (Romans 7:15&17) He explores this spiritual struggle with unabashed fervor in a tale still talked about over a hundred years later.<br /><br />The story, no longer than a novella, reads quickly. Told through second-hand accounts and letters (similar to Stoker's \\"Dracula\\"), the tale's violence and mayhem are never directly experienced through the eyes of a victim or the perpetrator, which made it more palatable for its original audience, but makes it somewhat distant for those bred on \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" We have no clear protagonist, no clear definition of the next victim of Mr. Hyde's brutality; we have only snippets of letters and glimpses of a broken body. Stevenson manages to create a sense of foreboding, and the good doctor's final confessions are chilling, in that they describe the common struggle that all humans encounter within, fighting for the moral and ethical high ground.<br /><br />Sadly, the story doesn't hold up as well as hoped to the test of time. It lacks true suspense, and there's little mystery to be found. In an era of Victorian virtue, though, it was surely shocking to have a writer admit to that struggle within and portray it in vivid terms.<br /><br />I'm glad to have read the book for myself, and I believe it was foundational in the evolution of psychological suspense.
B001N26GFM|4.0|The book was  the gift of a friend. An easy reading, nothing new, with some slightly tedious bits. However, the rather surprising turn at the end makes up for all of it - makes one empathise and think! It is an excellent choice as a present for teens and adults.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|I don't usually care for many tv shows, but this one I absolutely fell in love with. I highly recommend it!
1401302378|4.0|I found this book to be very enlightening. It offers a wonderful breakdown of various internet retailer's philosophies which can be dated back many years. A lot of it is common sense but it gives you a better understanding into the reasoning as to why things are done the way they are. It has also made me a firm believer in the future of internet retailing, even after the .com bust. Amazon is referrenced several times and I have a greater appreciation for what they do. It is certainly worth your while.
B003102JDM|5.0|With A SERIOUS MAN, the Coen Brothers have crafted a movie that doesn't fully fit with the rest of their work.  Usually, their films can be divided in one of two categories: tragic dramas where most people end up dying; and so-dark-you-need-to-flip-on-the-lights comedy.  A SERIOUS MAN is neither.  It is dark; it is not a feel-good movie, and you walk away from it with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach.  But it isn't wholly serious, either; it's comedy is wry and understated, even by Coen standards.  Nor is there really much of a plot: Larry Gopnik is a middle-aged college professor whose life is slowly spinning out of control.  His cyst-suffering brother Arthur is under investigation for various escalating crimes; his son, a stoner, is getting ready for his bar mitzvah; his position is up for tenure, just as a Korean student is trying to bribe him, and someone is writing nasty letters to the tenure committee; his wife is leaving him for a man who is rather less-than-ideal; and to add to his troubles, Larry is going through a rather strong crisis of faith, which even a string of rabbis can't help with.<br /><br />This is a slow film, heavy on symbolism: it begins with a Yiddish folktale, and ends...well, symbolically.  In between, you will find some above-par performances primarily from a cast of unknowns, led by Michael Stuhlbarg as Larry.  The direction is as solid as ever; the cinematography (from Roger Deakin, frequent Coen collaborator) is beautiful; and the brothers' script well-deserves its Oscar nod.  There's not much here not to love; just remember, as Jessica McManus (who plays Larry's daughter) says in the making of feature: \\"Every day that goes by they depress me more.\\"  This is not a movie for the weak-willed, and is sure to alienate some viewers.  But then, that's the Coen Brothers for you.  A SERIOUS MAN ranks among the best of their work, and will go down as a minor classic of understated film-making.
B002E01LL6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  First of all, it has Channing Tatum... an up and coming actor, who delivers a genuine performance and is totally watchable with his first rate acting.  Secondly, it has a good story line and the actors make their scenes work.
078322804X|5.0|\\"The Blues Brothers\\" is one of those films you wind up watching again and again. In large part this is because of the music-- the film is really a musical at heart, and a chance to showcase the talents of some of the greatest singers of our time. And because it is a musical, the film gets away with taking liberties with reality that even a comedy would hesitate to do.    It helps that this is also Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi at the height of their game. Few comedians could have kept these characters interesting for a solid 2 1/2 hours, sometimes making us laugh with nothing more than a glance. And the car chase scenes are nothing short of inspired, particularly at the end, when the movie slips into an almost surreal armageddon for police cars, with a supporting cast of angry country singers and even the infamous Illinois Nazis for good measure.    A mission from God, indeed.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|I'm a big fan of scary movies.  However, most of the scary movies I watch may make me jump while I'm watching them, or feel nervous or scared while they're on, but after the movie is over, I quickly forget all about them.  Every once in a while, I watch a movie that leaves me feeling unsettled and scared long after the movie is over - Paranormal Activity was one of those movies.    I found this movie genuinely frightening.  Its not the type of movie that makes you jump (with one notable exception) - rather it creates this sense of dread that just gets worse and worse as the movie goes on.  It does not rely on gore or special effects, just on the susceptibility of your imagination.  This is not a movie for everyone.  You need to have an open mind, a good imagination, and be someone who believes that, just maybe, possession and demons can exist in a nice San Diego suburb.    This is a low budget movie that never leaves the house of Micah and Katie.  There is quite a bit of dialogue in this movie and many times where nothing is happening on screen.  This invoked in me a sense of fear and anticipation, however, I can see how other people could find this extremely boring.     The only problem I had with this movie was the shaky cam.  It definitely lent a sense of realism to the movie, however, it gave me a headache.  Anyone prone to motion sickness may need to look away periodically while watching this movie or they may find themselves getting sick instead of scared.    If you like scary movies that leave you with an unsettled feeling that has you looking around nervously every time your house creaks, I think you will really enjoy this movie.  If you prefer your horror gory and action-filled, you won't find those kind of scares here.
B002LFIZDG|4.0|For the most part, \\"Declaration of Dependence\\" sounds like best buddies hanging out at a secluded European beach and playing a few tunes for their closest friends. Kings of Convenience's third album appears to have become the decidedly unplugged creative outlet for Norwegian boy wonder Erlend Oye, who also heads up Whitest Boy Alive, an excellent band in its own right. There is a noticeable lack of drums (and any clever studio trickery) on this album, although one could argue that these fellows strum their guitars with a percussive feel at times. Most of the songs follow the simple formula of one player strumming the percussive rhythmic chords with the other guitar running over the top with a pleasant riff, with an occasional string of violin or piano notes added to the mix.<br /><br />The album starts off with the nostalgic \\"24-25\\" and picks up where \\"Riot on an Empty Street\\", the Kings previous album and magnum opus, left off- a soothing Simon and Garfunkel-esque vocal harmony over two gently plucked guitars.<br /><br />Next up is the super catchy \\"Mrs. Cold,\\" the standout track on the album. The tempo picks up a bit here, and if we were laying out on a chilly Icelandic beach on Track 1, the beach we are laying on here is more like Rio de Janeiro- warm and sunny, despite the title. This track also introduces the violin in the last few seconds, which is used sparsely throughout the album, most noticeably on \\"Boat Behind,\\" another pleasant seaside ditty exploring the themes of independence vs. dependence. Nothing mind-blowing lyrics wise, but something every listener should be able to relate with.<br /><br />\\"Me in You\\", the third track on the album, also introduces a bare bones piano (much less noticeable than it was on \\"Misread\\") and the pleasant female backing vocals we remember from previous albums.<br /><br />\\"Rule My World\\" reminds me of something Oye would have penned in his younger days, and despite its mention \\"moral superiority\\" and of an \\"all-forgiving God / you claim that you believe in,\\" has a slightly humorous feel when the chorus hits and they belt out permission for their female counterparts to rule their worlds.<br /><br />After this track, the album begins to slow down a bit at the middle, and continues until the end, just like \\"Riot\\" did, which eventually closed with the epic \\"Gold in the Air of Summer\\" and \\"The Build Up.\\" Although there is nothing here that rivals those two, and detractors of the album will claim the second half of the album is a bit of a bore, there is still plenty here to appreciate with a bit of patience. \\"Power of Not Knowing\\" will be a treat for fans of Nick Drake and \\"Peacetime Resistance\\" and \\"My Ship Isn't Pretty\\" continues the theme of \\"quiet protests against loneliness.\\" Longtime fans of The Kings will also appreciate \\"Riot on an Empty Street\\", yes, the track title, and not the album, an apparent remnant track from years ago.<br /><br />The Kings aren't breaking any new ground on this album, and perhaps it may have even been a step backwards, but in an era when voiceboxes, autotune and synthesizers are dominating the airwaves, I'm sure this is a welcome direction for many.

B00005JLD4|5.0|Wow... incredible movie with gut wrenching scenes.  The acting is top rate... the movie is based on real life situations... it's hard to watch, at times, but this is life and one is not always exposed to the best things.  A movie that you never forget.

B00006LFGD|4.0|I love this CD.  There are mostly older duets but a few new ones and they are all very good.  When listening to the CD in the car, it makes for a relaxing ride especally this month (February) we have sooooooo much snow.  It was a very good buy and I would highly recommend.

143350393X|5.0|I own a huge number of Bibles, and I especially love Study Bibles, since the footnotes are so helpful. There are a lot of very good study Bibles out there, including my next favorite, the New Interpreter's Bible, but the ESV study Bible is hands down a work of art.<br /><br />The text is done in a single column, which is much easier to read than double column text. The footnotes are extensive- there are at least as many notes as there are passages in the Bible. But the most jaw-dropping feature are the colored maps and illustrations- that are beautifully printed in colored ink- and are right IN the regular pages of text. There is also a section of maps in the back, as many Bibles have, but I have never seen such gorgeous illustrations right in the text- where you can study them as you read.<br /><br />There is a really nice Concordance in the back (I am stunned that some Bibles don't have these at all)! and the Keywords are in large bold capital letters. It is highly readable and easy to find things. You also get a code to have this Bible in the online version. I love this feature because I can do a search for any topic, and paste all the verses I like the most in a word document to study.<br /><br />I bought the Tru-Tone binding. I was told it was real leather, and it is not, but it actually feels much better and softer than most genuine leather Bibles do these days. In fact, it has a very impressive hand-feel to it, and I will not hesitate to buy others. In the past I would ONLY buy genuine (not bonded) leather.<br /><br />I find the ESV text very good and readable, but not as much as the NIV. I hope they issue this Bible with other translations, and with a slightly LARGER font size as I have very poor eyesight. For most readers, the font would probably be fine and very comfortable. An indexed version in leather would also be great.
B002UD56I6|3.0|This Blu-ray (movie) is a thinly discuised way of extracting money from Michael's fans. He looks frail and out of it. He has no lasting energy and looks like the only thing keeping him going (beside the constant \\"stroking\\") is illicit. This is not a fitting tribute to his legacy. I couldn't help but think as I watched... that had he not succumb to a tragic overdose now, he probably wouldn't have survived the exhausting concert tour ahead of him. (another great performer seduced by the dark side)
B000G73U5Y|5.0|This is the perfect CD for anyone who loves Steely Dan.  It has all of their best songs, including Dirty Work which is my personal favorite.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|A great movie, I highly recommend.  Although, I would also recommend watching the Firefly series before you jump into this.  Blu Ray works on my PC with PowerDVD and AnyDVD.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is one of the most innovative and influential albums in alternative rock music.  It's dark and haunting melodies are eerily beautiful, while it's blend of electronic effects and rock instrumentation paved the way for a new trend in music to come.  Definitely a huge leap forward from the already envelope pushing previous album O.K. Computer.  This release features some of the band's best work including the songs Idioteque, Everything in its Right Place, and How to Disappear Completely.
B002GJT4XM|5.0|It was such a pleasure to watch this film with the added scenes.  My favorite addition were the eggs near the beginning.  If you haven't seen it yet...be prepared to be surprised.  I loved it!

B001AVCFK6|4.0|Definitely one of the better, if not the best, Star Trek movies.  Not a real in-depth, though provoking movie, but fun to watch.  I can watch on my PC with PowerDVD, but it lags on AnyDVD.  Still worth seeing, though.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|The first season of Dexter is an absolute gem.  Introducing you to Dexter Morgan, a morally bound serial killer with an intriguing past (who happens to work for the Miami police department), the first season of this show takes you on an addictive journey into the mind of an atypical murderer with a persuasive point of view.  Though dark in nature, the show has a great sense of humor and a cast that grow on you almost instantaneously.  Give this show a chance, you won't be disappointed.
B000YABIQ6|2.0|I have bought a lot of DVD's of movies and TV shows and have never had discs that do not play in the DVD or just play when they feel like it.  It is ridiculous.

1594481938|4.0|One of my biggest fears when I picked up this book was that it would be a cloying depiction of suicide (I want to kill myself, someone tells me life is worth living, then everything works out) or a nihilistic depiction of suicide (I want to kill myself, someone stops  me, things get worse, I kill myself anyway). To Mr. Hornby's great credit, this novel is neither! Nick Hornby tackles the dark subject of suicide with tenderness, comedy, and even sympathy in this interesting novel.  He approaches it honestly, and one of the novel's greatest strengths is that the ending is not a nicely tied up movie plot finale. Many of the issues that drove the four central characters to consider taking their lives have not gotten better, some have even gotten worse, but what has changed is that the characters realize life is what it is. You either take it on its terms, or you get out.<br />Of the four central characters, two are immensely unlikable, but the characters of Maureen and JJ have sincerity to them that I enjoyed. The novel is written from the first person perspective of the four protagonists, and each has a distinct voice and style. The story is told chronologically, with each chapter alternating the first person point of view. Hornby does not fall prey to the usual traits of alternating first person novels. The story progresses with each chapter. We don't get every person's version of the same events, we get a progressing story, with each character picking up and moving the plot points forward.<br />Life does not come to a halt because things get rough. The current keeps rolling along and Hornby's final chapter and sentence is poignant in its simplicity and truth.<br /> I enjoyed this novel. It makes a relevant point, but without the melodrama or preachiness of many novels that tackle the same subject.

0375842209|5.0|I'll cut right to the chase. This book is utterly amazing. Its characters are unforgetable, the atmosphere is better than in Bioshock, and the narrorator is death. How can you go wrong with death? The only thing it doesn't have is an amazing twist at the end. It almost counts, but death tells you mid-way through. Although thats not exactly bad. It makes you fell like death is sitting next to you.

B002W6Z0UK|4.0|I must confess I wasn't too excited about Gaga when I heard her first release.<br />I just figured ok...\\"disco redux\\". I saw her videos and thought \\"WOW\\", this is a serious performer with a lot of \\"thought\\" behind what she does. I read an interview<br />of her whiin which she mentions David Bowie as one of her influences. He had a very theatrical persona in his time. Gaga is a fine video artist and her CD's are<br />candy for the mind. This one is not as good as The Fame, but I LOVE \\"Dance in the Dark\\" and \\"Telephone\\"....She is a very impressive young artist. I hope she<br />is with us for a long time and not a two CD Wonder. BTW, I also ENJOY the remix<br />releases from her. I was a little skeptical of them, but hearing different versions of the songs I love is COOL. Enjoy!

The story is captivating with its meticulous details, wittiness , and gripping words, leaving you wanting more. Hope there is a sequel that will be longer than the first. The book was ideal except one detail, it wasn't long enough.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I own the Mono Box Set, and bought the stereo issue of \\"The Beatles\\" (White Album) to round out my collection.  The sound quality is terrific, and there are enough differences in the mixing of this and the mono version for both to be required.    This has long been my favorite Beatles album, and I have never enjoyed it more than on both the mono and stereo 2009 remasters.    For casual fans, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this and the entire stereo set, but for true fanatics, the mono set is also required.    Most impressive to me were the many sounds and effects on Revolution No. 9 that I had never heard before on the 1987 master, and the sound quality is such these songs could have been recorded yesterday, rather than 42-years-ago.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I love Jillian and this is definitely a great workout. I like that it has three levels that you can advance from. Just be warned that you have to buy hand weights to do it. I didn't realize and had to wait a few days to purchase those before I could start the workouts. I'm overweight and can do all the exercises just fine. It also motivates me to want to advance to the higher level workouts. Great for beginners! I love it!
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The Beatles have never sounded this good.  The bass on \\"Come Together\\" alone is worth the price.
B001FB55I0|4.0|I won't convolute this review for Terminator Salvation with my opinions about the other films in the series, the Terminator mythology, or what have you; I'll simply say that - even as a stand alone film - Terminator Salvation...  is very good.  Sure, it's driven, to a degree, by special effects and action with choice little bits tossed to long-time fans, but I found it to be an entertaining, well-made film.  And the story is good also.  Foretold leader of the resistance against the machines John Connor (Christian Bale) is NOT the main character; though his role is not insignificant (or poorly acted, in my opinion).  The film focuses more on the newly-introduced character Marcus Wright (as portrayed by Sam Worthington); whose part in the film serves as an interesting standard for comparison against the John Connor that survived Judgement Day and has seen war.  I'd say Terminator Salvation is not about metallic, single-minded killing machines, great action, or obligatory explosions; though it certainly is not lacking in these things.  It's ultimately a story about moral responsibility, strength of character, and - humanity.  These subjects play out from the perspective of Marcus as well as Connor, and neither character comes off as one-dimensional.    Really I'm making more of an attempt to avoid spoiling the film than I am to exaggerate its themes; it is, boiled down to basics, a solid action film fueled by great special effects.  The \\"Terminator\\" is still a unique and frightening \\"movie monster,\\" and John Connor is a brave man struggling against seemingly impossible odds.  Add to the mix Marcus Wright, a man with a shameful past and an unexpected second chance, and you have a worthwhile film with characters in which you want to believe and follow throughout the course of the storyline.  Yes, I've been fairly vague, but I encourage anyone that has so much as even considered seeing the film to give it a chance.  And anyone who just plain appreciates well-done action,movie magic, or creepy human-exterminating robots from the future (I know I do) shouldn't pass up Terminator Salvation either.    Now that I've done my best to make a case for this movie, I'll address something else: with the blu-ray version (I can not speak for the DVD version) you get both the PG-13 theatrical version of the film and the R-rated \\"director's cut.\\"  Having watched both, I'll say that the PG-13 version isn't really less-satisfying, and the R-rated version didn't seem to add so much \\"adult\\" content as to even warrant the upped rating.  I'd say that all three of the previous Terminator films were bloodier.  Of course, this film (unlike its predecessors) is more action than thriller, so it makes sense.  And the \\"worst\\" thing added to the R-rated version of Salvation is some brief (and not especially showy) female nudity.
B000063UR1|4.0|3.8 stars<br /><br />I'd never seen this until I heard it mentioned as an inspiration for the recent and decent sci-fi flick, Moon; I was very impressed by SR's opening 20 minutes, but it tapered off a bit and never really regained its full footing.<br /><br />Nonetheless, discounting the mostly good but occasionally mediocre low budget aspects, writer/director Trumbull does a fine job of getting a lot of production value from a million bucks. Above all he gets an excellent, affecting performance from Dern, who is often almost over the top but not quite. He makes this film work.<br /><br />I must admit to some tedium during the bonding-with-droids section, but in general I liked the story and message a whole lot. Dern's speech about real food vs. processed crap rings truer than ever today, as do many other of Trumbull's very intelligent environmental points, well ahead of their time in 1974 and, sadly, even today. There are some very fine defenses of living a natural life here. Trumbull was clearly a man ahead of his time.<br /><br />All in all, SR is well worth watching for any sci-fi, Dern, or nature lover, and is to be commended for having a large heart worn proudly on its sleeve.
B00005QFE5|5.0|This is the first film (not TV) that Zhang Ziyi made (at the age of 19 or 20) playing the part of 16/18. It is not a \\"action\\" film but it is one of her best.  After seeing \\"The Road Home\\" I had to \\"google wikipedia\\" for a list of all her films and am presently working thru all of Zhang Ziyi, Gong Li, Maggie Cheung, and Michelle Yeoh's films. If you want to see a \\"Real Love Story\\" this is the film to see. I only wish that \\"The Road Home\\" film had been longer. I regretted to see it end

B001AVCFK6|5.0|The movie is outstanding, one of the best of the year.  Even friends who actively despise Star Trek had to admit they enjoyed this one.  The blu-ray looks and sounds great.  I haven't watched the special features, but will get around to it eventually.
B002Q9MZF6|4.0|Clearly (from the reviews of this title) there are some opera lovers who like only traditional stage performances of operas. Which is fine, but the virulent criticism of this version seems a bit over the top. It's as if the critics are so concerned with demonstrating the purity of their high-minded regard for the art that they forget how to enjoy it.     Concerns about lip-syncing aside, this seems to me to be a perfectly legitimate creation. I sincerely doubt that Puccini would regard it as a \\"rape\\", to quote a previous reviewer. He was an artist, and therefore open-minded. You may or may not like Anna and Rolando; for me it's much more convincing to see a handsome, slender intense young Rodolfo than a middle aged plumpo. The same applies for the stunning Anna. It does appear that not too many reviewers had complaints about the singing, at least.     Anyway, aren't there enough versions of Boheme around to allow something different and experimental? I bet this film brings a lot more new fans to the genre than any of the more traditional productions. And if you want to see the genre survive, you're going to need new blood in the audience.

B0000DZ3EN|3.0|I love this film...so close to the great books of Baum.  However after finally getting it on DVD, the film quality is not good...the colors and picture are not crisp and clean...not sharp...it almost looks like a video transfer...what a shame!  Such a beautiful production full of color.  Am I crazy or is this a dud transfer? They say this movie is scary...well delve into the books...they are scary and divine!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Colonel Landa has got to be the best movie villian since Chigur from No Country for Old Men.  The movie does its job as a tribute to titles such as \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" and \\"Kelly's Heroes\\".  It's a fun experience with great characters and Pitt pulls off the role as Aldo with great comic effect, it was a role out of his norm and one that should be saluted.  Overall a fun movie that does a great job of creating tension when needed while mixing in humor appropriately.  The dialogue is great as usual when it comes to a Tarantino movie and I can't understand anyone who would come away from this movie entertained so long as they take it for what it is...a fairy tale.
B000002VCW|5.0|I bought this CD because I wanted to learn \\"the Border\\" - a great song about the fine line between tourism and what now call terrorism.  celebrating and bemoaning change in the world.  The other songs are good too, especially \\"Year of the Cat\\".  I'd go to an Al Stewart live show anytime.

B001H122N4|5.0|When one looks at the era from which Pink Floyd sprang, my era musically, it's hard to define the niche occupied by this seminal group. They were above all, a live group, with monster PA systems and on stage special effects that even today's producers are hard pressed to duplicate let alone equal. They were a show band, always socially aware, due in part to the lyrics of Roger Waters (not part of this album) but also musically innovative in ways that are subtle and not always recognized by critics of this newest generation. Their finest album, (arguably, Gilmour thinks so) \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" became the largest selling album of all time until eclipsed by Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\". I suspect and hope that as time goes by, \\"Dark Side\\" will reclaim it's number one status. It was and is a bit of work that appeals to every music lover who comes to that age where peer pressure gives way to personal taste and discrimination.     This album will stand along side of \\"Dark Side\\" like a book end; a career statement. Gilmour, Wright, and Mason with friends Dick Parry and others have set the capstone on the work of this group. Wright is now, sadly, gone too. Following Syd Barret by a couple of years. Roger is off doing his thing. Too bad he didn't have just a touch of Richard's personality. There's no telling where this extraordinary ensemble might have gone. Still my favorite group from my youth, and this album, is a must for Pink Floyd, David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Nick Mason fans. A must have album for any music lover. Get it! You won't be disappointed
0670021652|1.0|Ms. Gilbert needs to find a way to justify marrying a man because it serves her purposes (being able to live in the United States with him).  She takes us on her tedious journey to find a way to do this.      I was surprised that she did not investigate people who like being married and uphold the institution.  She does not present a balanced viewpoint on marriage - only those facts that served her intentions.  She did not go on a quest for the TRUTH... rather for information that could rid her of the guilt of having to go back on her own declaration that marriage does not work.    Ms. Gilbert falls into the category of those people who have a failed marriage and decide that there is something wrong with the institution of marriage - rather than own their own mistakes in attempting marriage.    If a reader really wants to explore the topic of marriage, I would recommend Elizabeth Fox-Genovese's  MARRIAGE - The Dream That Refuses to Die
B00000F14B|5.0|Bought the music and video as my granddaughter is appearing in her school play of the Music Man.  Need the music for practice purposes.  Video gave idea as to character acting. the delivery timing was fast and efficient.  Thank you for such good service.
0805062971|5.0|there's not much to say, Fight Club has been my own personal Bible for ever since the first time i heard about it. it's a great book (and a great movie) so owning a copy of it is something i consider necessary for all those who feel they need a breath of fresh air in today's world of forced comfort, convenience and promoted dumbed-down-to-consuming lifestyle. if you haven't read it  - read it. it will turn your world upside down.   now about the product: again, Amazon holds the number one position in offering the best deals. this was just what i wanted, used but in great condition, travel size and very cheap.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|I actually thought this movie was really good. I don't know why some people think its bad, just depend on what kind of movies people enjoy watching.
B002RSDW80|3.0|It is such a shame that this film, like so many other Hollywood films, couldn't resist making spiteful, hurtful remarks about Republicans. I wish someone like Mr. Tucci or Ms. Adams (both of whom I admire) would have had the character to say, \\"We shouldn't be using this film to take cheap-shots at a whole group of people we don't even know. We have no right to gratuitously insult them like this. We are, or should be, better than that.\\" In short, I wish those who made these decisions would have shown some class and grace. I own, and enjoy watching, Ms. Child's original cooking shows, and she never used them to engage in political posturing. You might have followed her fine example.<br />Having said that, I want to say thank you to those of you who were focused on making the best movie you could about two interesting people. Your hard work is apparent in many aspects of the film. I particularly want to compliment the set dressers and costumers for their outstanding work. I was also very impressed with Jane Lynch's performance as Dorothy McWilliams, Julia Child's sister. From the moment Ms. Lynch appears, the audience sees a complete, distinctive, and engaging character - a really fine job of acting by a very talented actress.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|I have always really loved horror films and giant monster films of any kind are a personal favorite.  The Tremors  films really are great films.  I finally broke down and bought the four pack featuring all four of the films.  while the first and second are my favorites all of them have some good selling points.  These films have already become classics because old and young alike enjoy them and they play at least one of  them on some channel on tv every week so I am not alone in loving these films.    If you love horror and giant worms that pull you underground and eat you and even if you don't you should  still get this pack of classic films.
0143116177|3.0|I certainly hope that Niall Ferguson, a professor of financial history at Oxford and Harvard, wrote his book \\"The Ascent of Money\\" in a flash of fury because it reads and feels like an unedited first draft. The writing is clumsy, silly, and at times offensive and insulting. Consider this sort of lame stupid writing more suited for a pornographic film than for a study of Western financial history: \\"So how did 'Mr. Bond' become so much more powerful than the Mr Bond created by Ian Fleming? Why, indeed, do both kind of bond have a licence to kill?\\" Worse is the reasoning, which is sloppy and too reverential of free market economics.    The first part of the book actually reads decently. Mr. Ferguson promised a popular book that explains the importance of financial innovation in the progress of Western civilization, and that he expertly does. He articulates how the development of bonds was a by-product of the Europeans' need to wage war. Indeed, he points out that Britain defeated Napoleon and the American North defeated the South because the former could finance their war from the international debt markets whereas the former had to rely on taxation and printing money. Mr. Ferguson also explains quite clearly the rise of companies and the stock market in Amsterdam because of the need for Dutch merchants to limit their risk and liability in international trade.     Where the book falls apart is when Mr. Ferguson begins to discuss the current financial crisis. Obviously an adamant admirer of Milton Friedman and the Chicago and Harvard free market school of economics, Mr. Ferguson, like most of his conservative brethren, are still in denial about what happened. He thinks that today's recession is caused by uncertainty, human behavior, and \\"evolution\\" (finance is constantly evolving and progressing, but this is also a chaotic process of \\"creative destruction\\"). Nowhere does he blame the silly utopian economics that justified the wholesale deregulation of American finance that permitted the creation of destructive debt instruments, predatory lending, and corrupt corporate practices that inevitably created this financial meltdown. More than anything today's economic crisis is a product of inadequate government regulation, supervision, and monitoring, especially on the part of the Federal Reserve. But Mr. Ferguson can't possibly admit this (there can be no questioning of the free market model!), and prefers to digress or attack his ideological enemies -- John Perkins who wrote \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,\\" Paul Krugman, and Joseph Stiglitz -- for their shoddy reasoning.     But consider this sort of statement from Mr. Ferguson: \\"The price of rescue by the state is control by the state, and already American banks are finding their freedom of action limited with respect to the compensation of executives and the hiring of foreigners.\\" Mr. Ferguson is clearly indignant that the government, after saving the financial system from its own greed and incompetence, would dare to puts its dirty hands into the market.     All in all, the entire book is a pointless endeavor, and for a more in-depth understanding of today's economic crisis read John Cassidy's \\"How Markets Fail.\\"
B002T9H2L0|5.0|i love this movie. the best example of Tarantino is a masterful writer. teh dialogue sequences are fantasticly suspenseful. if he doesnt win an award for this movie it would be a crime.
B00319ECHE|3.0|Amazing double bass drumming? Check.<br /><br />Downtuned shredding riffs? Check<br /><br />Synthesized background noises courtesy of Rhys Fulber? Double Check.<br /><br />Yep, its Fear Factory alright. You know, I'm not really giving them a hard time. This is a \\"pretty good\\" album, but literally NOTHING you havent already heard on Demanufacture or Obsolete, and those albums are better. I myself like artists to change and grow. I just don't think Fear Factory has the capacity to do that anymore. The genre of Metal is hard to keep fresh because its a very anti-melodic genre. Even with the familiar now trademark melodic break-downs in Fear Factory's songs, you still can't help but feel you are hearing the previously mentioned albums again, with different lyrics.<br /><br />So again, not a bad album, but a bit by-the-numbers. If you don't mind repetition, then this album is for you. Its definitely a step up from Transgression (yuck).
B000KX0IOA|4.0|Joanna Goins  REL-110-E02  Gandhi  Gandhi is a 1982 biographical film based on the life and death of Gandhi, who led the nonviolent resistance movement against British colonial rule in India during the first half of the 20th century. The film begins with Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948, and his funeral. After an evening prayer, Gandhi is helped out for his evening walk to meet greeters and admirers. One of the greeters shoots him point blank in the chest. Dignitaries from around the world attended his funeral. After the funeral the story go back 55 years. In 1983, Gandhi was thrown off a train in Africa for being an Indian. After this experience he begins to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in Africa. The government finally recognizes rights for Indians. Gandhi then went back to India where he became a national hero. Gandhi continued to set up non-violent campaigns. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declared a hunger strike stating that he will not eat until the fighting stops. He becomes widely known as Mahatma, meaning great-souled. The fighting finally stops and the country divides by religion. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring peace between the nations. He begins to anger his dissidents on both sides. Gandhi traveled into troubled areas, conducting prayer vigils and fasts, but on one of these visits in 1948 he was assassinated by a Hindu extremist at the end of the film that recalls the opening of the movie. As the man shoots Gandhi, the film fades to black and Gandhi voice is heard saying \\"Oh God\\". The audience then sees Gandhi's cremation and the film ended with a scene of Gandhi's ashes being scattered on the holy Ganga. After watching the movie I found that Hinduism beliefs played a huge part in this movie. Gandhi was Hindu and he believed in non-violence. He wanted freedom and peace among the different religions. He believed in treating people the way you want to be treated.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|After watching the somewhat decent thirty minutes animated episodes and trying to forget the atrocious five minutes animated episodes we now have what is probably the best selection for the star wars storyline cgi animation.  At first I wasn't sure if I should get this series set or not as I remembered the aforementioned series that came before this one but after seeing a few on cable it made my choice very easy to make, and while it doesn't reach the cgi advertisement cut scenes that Bioware did for the Knights of the old republic computer games it's still pretty decent and action packed enough that most star wars fans will be entertained by the series.  The series gives a nice look of the years of the clone wars and what was happening with the jedi between this time and Episode III,  especially with the background story with Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi as well as a few new characters including a young jedi that is Anakin's apprentice during the war and their connection as well.  It will seem a little funny since with us watching the prequel movies as you listen to the voices of Anakin and Obi-wan throughout the series but surprisingly they voice actors get you into the series with you thinking that they're Anakin and Obi-wan regardless on how they sound(Though the voice for Obi-wan sounded closer to the actor in the movies than the voice for Anakin).  The video and audio for the set is great no distortions to worry yourself about and the extras are pretty good as well but I'm sure many people like myself don't really bother to much with the extras as more to seeing the series itself.  So until the second season comes out on sale and for the price this set is going for a most for any star wars fan...
1594488843|1.0|This book is a waste of money. The big ideas presented with the exception of those ideas from the book \\"Flow\\" which came out in 1990 largely go back to the 1970's. Any well-read individual will be familiar with them. You're better off reading the original material as the author adds very little.
B000SSPL2Q|4.0|I find sound quality good on CD and hopefully DG decided not to offer an hybrid sacd & cd disc.<br /><br />Dynamic range is good enough to offer sonic subtlety on low movements and not compress too much when bigger sound...<br /><br />I give 4 stars to sound quality.
B001DZ9GRE|5.0|[[ASIN:B001DZ9GRE The Annie Lennox Collection (Deluxe Edition) (Incl. 2 CD's + DVD)]]  I found these CD'S really great the music and Artist make these CD'S  DVD well worth purchasing, like the style and Annie Lennox is a longtime favourite, highly recomend to purchase.

B002SJIO4A|1.0|Is it just me ... I don't know - I don't care.  I hated this movie. I don't like movies that do newsreels and reality TV show type.  I am throwing it out - I watched 45 minutes of it and that was enough.  Had I been in the theater I would have walked out.

B001676320|5.0|This is what music DVD's and Blu-Ray discs should be like. Can't think of anything wrong with this release. Even if you aren't a die hard fan of either band (like me), you will appreciate the perfect sound and picture quality, combined with excellent musicianship and stunning performances. I was very much blown away by the quality of this release.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|My girlfriend loves this movie and even though it wasn't expensive, it was the best gift she has ever gotten.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|First thing you should notice is the box the cable comes in.  Excellent packaging amazon.  Then the cable, you'll see, is high quality as far as I can tell.  IT's braided, which feels nice.  And the gold plated HDMI ports look nice too.  I suppose they contribute to the overall quality of the cable, I'm just not sure how.  Picture quality is great.  No slip ups.  All in all very happy with the product.
B002P4VUMQ|4.0|I have been a fan of Mr AZ for quite a while now. This live CD is very enjoyable, I got it as a gift for my partner who is a HUGE fan. We both loved the DVD that accompanied it, as did the entire group of people that watched it with us. I would DEFINITELY recommend this CD to any Jason Mraz fan - new and old.
B00005JOA0|2.0|I am giving this one a low rating because of how far off the story of the movie is from the book. If I had never read [[ASIN:0199207550 The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Oxford World's Classics)]], I might have given this a 3 star rating, but it just doesn't compare to the book at all. The actors are alright, but there were parts about the costumes/hairstyles that got on my nerves. I think they could have done a much better job. I also wish they would have stayed with the real storyline a little better. I understand that movies will always be a little different than the book, but I felt like they really went way off in this one. And it wasn't like it was for lack of time, because it was three hours long...three one hour sections. I would watch it again, so it isn't like I hated it, I just didn't really like it all the much. But I have only seen it once, and sometimes on the second watching you will like it more, so that is why I would watch it again...plus I own it, so might as well watch it again someday right!?!
B002YIHO7I|3.0|Let me start by saying... this is my FIRST review on Amazon and I am a die-hard Sade fan. I want to say I love this CD or even like it, but my love is not blind and the truth is, this CD is simply dull as dust. The single release Soldier of Love blew me out the water and wet all our appetites for what was to come. It never quite delivered. It's the only song with staying power. I'm all for sublime music, but please give us some memorable melodies, perhaps a bridge, a subtle build up, perhaps a song longer than 5 minutes. What's most dumbfounding is that many believed Ms. Adu owes much of her success to her band. In this case, this is the first Sade CD where the band falls short. This is also the first Sade CD where I actually hated certain tracks, and wanted to skip them.  First 3 songs:  Great start, vocally, musically, lyrically.  It's downhill from there. I will applaud them for attempting to go from reggae to country within just 2 tracks (Babyfather, Be That Easy), but the musical quality is just not there.  Elevator music? Independent movie soundtrack? Music for insomniacs? Its a mish mosh of the same boring style that just doesn't seem to fit, nor are the lyrics and hooks captive enough to recall. Those who find this \\"soulful\\" must have souls that are barely living. Life is what's missing from this CD. And perhaps the kiss of life would help now more than ever.  It pains me to give this CD JUST TWO stars, but that's mostly because out of 10 songs, there are only 2 I'm excited about. The Moon and The Sky, Soldier of Love. Morning Bird is interesting, somewhat good, as is Bring Me Home and In Another Time, but by the time we reach these track, its a little too late to resurrect the soldier, who obviously died in battle.  Hopefully, he will rise again like the phoenix from the flame and return as Sade, a lead vocalist, and entire band with a distinct sound we've grown to love and recognize over the years. Please Sade, to quote the lyrics from your song... \\"The small steps you need to take is a mountain, stretched out like a lazy dog...  Bring me home.\\"    =============== UPDATE ============     \I've upgraded my review from 2 stars to stars, since as it turns out, the more I listen to this CD, the more it grew on me, snuck up on me, and captured me. Now instead of 2 songs that I like, there are only 2 songs that I dislike, with some being enjoyable. The problem is the well constructed songs with provocative lyrics have no bridge, no build and are over in less than 3 minutes. I believe in restraint, but this comes of as laziness. Still, I'm convinced I'm a fan since it took some time, but I do appreciate the movie soundtrack score this CD seems to display. Not Sade's best work, but worthy of more than just 2 Stars.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|The actors, especially the main heroin, were adorable. It is an Austen classic, so slow in parts for some people, but if you are an Austen fan I think you will agree they did a great job with it overall. I love all things Austen, and yet had never watched this one before, so I was very happy to get it for Christmas. I watched it on New Years Eve, so I wasted no time getting to it, and I was not disappointed. I think any Austen fan would enjoy this film version of the book. (Although it has been awhile since I read [[ASIN:1593083807 Northanger Abbey (Barnes & Noble Classics)]], so I am not a good judge at how close they stuck to the original work!)
B002LW9ITY|5.0|This gift set has been one of the greatest value for money purchases I have found in a long time,a car each for My boys and the dvd for their play room and the Blueray for Me....cer-chow !
B0000004F9|5.0|These two recordings are absolutely jaw dropping in terms of originality, youthful joy and musicianship.  This is psychedelic rock, leavened with jazz, but infused with an exhuberant love of the pop idom.  This may sound an impossible combination, but the Soft Machine manages to pull it off, song after song.  Indeed, these songs fly into one another with a daffy coherence; and like Zappa, whole albums have been created by other [lesser!]groups based upon a single musical idea thrown off herein.  Buy this album, and let it take over your ears, and excite your mind.  It is that good.  I listen to these two recordings over and over again, and each and every time, it seems like the very first time.  Mind blowing music.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|Christmas break of 1998, second floor living-room of a New Jersey Victorian house, visiting friends; the snow started falling at dusk and now it was well underway, the generous flakes absorbing any sound in the atmosphere. The fireplace radiates a soft glow and the sweet scent of burning pine wood. Tucked in the couch, I am reading a good spy novel. And on the Stereo, Sade's Love Deluxe is playing over and over, making the evening unforgettable, etching every detail to my memory.<br /><br />Since then the deep, magic voice of SADE provided the soundtrack of many evenings of my life. However, LOVE DELUXE remained unsurpassed. SOLDIER OF LOVE though came as close as none other album.<br /><br />SOLDIER OF LOVE is a masterpiece. Every single song is wonderful and yet LONG HARD ROAD and IN ANOTHER TIME are the ones I feel longing for. Both of these songs remind of Sade's signature sounds. The rest of the album though takes well studied steps, dancing around her previous works.<br /><br />Fans will find this album comfortable like an old favorite sweater and fresh like untouched morning snow. If you do not know Sade, this is one of her albums that you must have.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
1604590483|5.0|I  love  this  book  , I keep  read reading this book every time, very positive  and keeps you  focus I  would  recommed this  book to  everyone .
B00005221M|3.0|I love this movie and was excited to find out it was a director's cut until I saw the whole thing.  Several of the steamy and clever one-liners have been edited out: \\"someday you and I are going to have a serious disagreement\\" and some lines from the scene in the glade in particular.  Chingachgook's speech at the end was completely unnecessary, and reeks of Big M Message that the director must think an intelligent viewer won't be able to pick up on independently.  I LOVE this movie, and have watched my VHS edition nearly to death, and am actually so disgusted with this version that I haven't watched it once since I bought it (2 years ago).
B000JQU1VS|4.0|A great compilation of thought provoking and wonderfully entertaining mystery short stories.  It is highly recommended.
006621131X|1.0|As much as I love Patti Smith, I fear she suffers from Lillian Hellman Syndrome: the ability to place yourself right in the middle of every historical event.  While Patti does not seat herself next to Winston Churchill, she certainly does manage to be present for several \\"pop\\" moments with stars of that period, though she was just a bookstore clerk vaguely dreaming of being creative.   Particularly absurd are the moments she supposedly shares with Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin.  It becomes a bit annoying, and just rings of fantasy.    But its the actual prose that was most disturbing.  I had such high expectations for her \\"voice\\"--but she reads like a really pretentious and slightly cliched 19th century romance.      Add to this the fact that she allowed herself to be treated like a doormat by Robert Mapplethorpe (including giving her a dose of VD) and it becomes a disappointing and not very interesting read all the way around.
032147404X|5.0|I already had this book and really enjoyed it.  When my granddaughter became interested in photography I thought she would get a lot out of it.

At last report she was reading the book completely and liked it a lot.<br />Johnny
B0030BOCKK|1.0|HIM is an obsession of mine. Their music is ravishing and mind-altering, climaxing with Venus Doom, in my opinion.  But I don't even want to hock this album in the Amazon Marketplace, it's such a wretched misrepresentation of what the band can do.  Love Metal does not manifest itself in the form of compact, Twilighty 3-minute tracks.  That's Love Pop/Poop.  Every line swells up like a chorus, but all sunshine does not give us just desserts.  I have trouble differentiating one song from the next, aside from \\"Dying Song,\\" which I think is lovely.<br /><br />That is all.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|For the past 10 years or so, I've been a very avid fan of Springsteen's work.  That may not sound like much, considering when he began recording, but consider the fact that that 10 years is half my life, and it's a huge deal.  I'm very familiar with his work, including B-sides and other little bonuses, and this album (\\"Working On A Dream\\") struck me, at first, as a B-side album to \\"Magic.\\"  My opinion has since changed very much.  From the opening 8-minute journey through the life of Outlaw Pete to the musings of a wrestler past his prime, Bruce has once again done what he does best - he's taken the life of an individual person in society, taken their story, and turned it into something fantastic and new, all the while maintaining the accuracy and intricacy of all the little details of that person's story.  Yes, he's done it before, but each time it's something new, and each time, it's fantastic.  This album is no exception.  I've come to love it very much.    The bonus DVD is a nice feature; it gives a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the album, and in one or two cases it shows the music video for a song as well.  The music video to \\"A Night With The Jersey Devil\\" can be found online, but here you have a copy to watch whenever you want, whether you are connected to the internet or not.    The packaging is very nice, though you can't take the lyric booklet out of it.  It's attached to the inside of the front flap of the album cover, while the CD is in a sleeve in the middle section and the DVD is in the right-hand section.    The only negative I have is that the CD case was bent slightly and wrinkled in the corners during shipping.  It's not a huge deal, but it was mildly annoying.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I REALLY liked this album. I think these guys are VERY talented. I love how the sound is VERY dancy, lots of electronic, energetic, upbeat sound, and yet still has a tinge of 70's funk (which I usually do not like, but works great here). They did an awesome job! I recommend to everyone, just to listen or play at clubs, it works both ways!
B00192IV0O|5.0|I love this CD!! It sounds awesome@ Fergie's voice is fabulous! She's way underrated! After listening to this you will feel very up and happy!! Cool!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|the band of brothers is a great movie.  people who are into history and/or just a good action movie will enjoy this.  I had watched it several times on television and i knew someday i would have to buy it.  now i am able to share it with family and friends who enjoy it also.

0307388921|4.0|While I consider Chuck Palahniuk to be one of the better living writers I've come across (I find his writing style to evoke a viscerally lush atmosphere, to be incisively witty, and page-turning-ly easy) I've noticed certain patterns in his stories which have proved to be at least a minor distraction.<br /><br />The frequent use of 12-step groups in his books--most notably 'FIght Club' and 'Choke'--kind of, at least for me, incited a tiny voice in the back of my mind that asked, \\"This.... again....?\\"<br /><br />If someone were to read a number of Palahniuk books, I would recommend breaking up 'Fight Club' and 'Choke' with 'Diary' or one of Palahniuk's other slightly less well-known books.<br /><br />Although, it's worth noting that another \\"formula\\" in Palahniuk's novels is 'the twisted, insightful outsider' (nothing wrong with that), which is the near certain constant main character in all.<br /><br />With Chuck Palahniuk's many gifts as a writer, it's worth picking up this or any of his books on a lazy day.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|This is a very good movie.    The movie is set in South Africa, and it's very easy to fall into the trap of drawing parallels to that country's history in race relations. But that is very lazy and simplistic because, in reality, this story wouldn't have been much different if it had been set in the US, Europe or Asia. The story is about one group's fear and hatred of something or someone perceived as \\"other.\\" It's about how that \\"other\\" can then be degraded into something looked on as inferior, and how that attitude is accepted by the first group to justify the mistreatment and abuse of the second. This was not a phenomenon exclusive to South Africa during apartheid, but a universal issue unfolding in one way or another everywhere in the world. After all, it's very easy to suspect, fear and hate something or someone that can be reduced to a \\"prawn.\\"    The movie does exploit the darker side of humanity, but it does so taking into account thousands of years of well-documented human history. It doesn't require much of a jump of the imagination to visualize the scenario portrayed in \\"District 9\\" when one takes into account the atrocities that humans perpetrate on each other every day with seemingly no end in sight. Therefore, it wasn't difficult for the creative team to imagine how we would treat an alien species that, although highly sophisticated, have suffered a tragedy during their voyage that left them extremely vulnerable.    The film can be difficult to watch because it sets up a mirror in front of viewers and forces them to confront their negative qualities and attitudes towards those they perceive as \\"other.\\" Some viewers may find this extremely disturbing and heavy-handed. But the truth of our collective selfishness isn't pretty to look at if it has your face on it.    The movie's open-ended story (both at the start and ending) invites the viewer to try and fill in the blanks about the aliens because there is not much known and understood about them by the humans. Some published critics have suggested that the open-ended story invites a sequel. That may be so, but I hope that the story is left as is. It is far more valuable if the end is left unresolved.
1577314808|5.0|The book was delivered on time and it was on great condition, just like new!. I highly recommend this seller.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|I'll just echo other positive reviews.  I almost wish I hadn't read the reviews first, because they had me looking for certain things in the movie.  This is the type of movie that you need to go into without any ideas of what it's really about.

1401323820|5.0|A fun book. This is a great idea to use the fictitious author of the TV series for the book. Great story both for book and TV show.

0316044695|5.0|The book is an excellent read for anyone especially people interested in war non fiction books.  Marcus Lutrell and his teammates are true heroes.
B00319ECC4|3.0|This album wasn't that impressive upon listening through it a couple times. The band replaced the guitarist Christian with Fear Factory's old guitarist Dino. The drummer Raymond who's a demigod of drumming in Demanufacture, Obsolete, and Archetype was replaced with Gene from Strapping Young Lad who just does generic blast beats. If the vocalist Burton thinks this is going to substitute for Raymond this is definitely not the case. Instead we have our generic lyrical content of the government system being corrupt like previous albums except no stories like Obsolete or Digimortal or Demanufacture. Instead Burton screams like generic metalcore and hardcore bands. This isn't Fear Factory and is just generic hashed up that will appeal to possibly new fans but anger older fans. The only decent tracks were \\"Powershifter\\" (Great Single) and \\"Final Exit\\". The bonus track \\"Crash Test\\" is a butchered wimpy screaming version of the original one on Soul of a New Machine (Solid album!). Although an improvement from Transgression it's nowhere near Archetype which can't touch Demanufacture. Someone knock some sense into Burton and bring back Raymond and Christian!    For fans wondering what Christian and Raymond have been working on they have two other bands called \\"Burn it All\\" and \\"Arkaea\\".
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I haven't had time to read this book yet, but I reviewed it and it is the version I wanted.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Okay, let me just start off by saying that this film was absolutely incredible. The first time i watched this movie in my living room, I wanted to stand up and applaud when it finished.The cinematography is absolutely stunning. Each scene contains so much color and detail. Each character is so colorful and essential in this incredible story. Some scenes of the movie left me speechless, while others had me in tears laughing. There is some violence in this movie, but it's necessary to the story and not overblown like every other movie these days. Of course, this movie isn't for everyone, but if you appreciate the art of cinema, great screenwriting, and incredible acting; then i would recommend it. Inglourious Basterds tells such a strong and incredible story that if i had no background knowledge of the 1930's-40's/Holocaust era, I would have pegged it as non-fiction.<br /><br />If you are watching this movie hoping for a factual holocaust movie with brutal war scenes, an inspiring, hollywood-esque Brad Pitt film, or an incredibly violent and fast-paced action film filled with explosives, fast cars, and naked women- be prepared to be disappointed.
B002QHELMI|2.0|I thought that the use was well understated. I received the book and the jacket was practically falling to pieces.
B002NUULNG|2.0|I rented this expecting an visual overhaul of the film. It's just about three scenes in full 3D CGI where as the rest of the film is simply \\"cleaned up\\". I didnt want anyone else mislead with this \\"2.0\\" edition. I'm glad that I did not purchase this again.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, together again, bring us a love story that extends beyond the man-made boundaries of time and space.  The story begins as Sandra and dog are leaving the Lake House, a gorgeous all-glass house that is located on and over a piece of a lake, near the shore. Separated from land by a tiny bridge cross, she hesitates at her mailbox to place a letter in it, then drives away in what looks like my first car, a 1968 gold Mustang (except mine had a white convertible top). We next see Keanu pull up to the Lake House in a 1968 ? pickup truck.  Bits of snow are on the ground.<br /><br />Back in Chicago, Sandra reports to her new assignment as Dr. (Kate) Forster at Chicago City Hospital.  At a construction site, architect Keanu (Alex) tells us that he has bought the Lake House.  As Alex moves in, he checks the mail box, finding a letter from Kate, as the former tenant, providing her new address and asking the \\"new owner\\" to forward her mail if he receives any of it. A scraggy dog soon shows up and runs into the Lake House.  We soon see the same scruffy dog with Kate.  (What is going on here?)<br /><br />Kate is back at the Lake House, retrieves a letter from Alex to her, from the mailbox.  He tells her the Lake House was empty for years and asks if she meant her letter for someone else.  She writes back, placing another letter for Alex in the Lake House mailbox and she just happens to mention that it is 2006.  Alex shows up at the address Kate gave him to hand-deliver a letter, but there is an empty lot, with luxury apartments scheduled to be built.  He returns home (to the Lake House) and drops the letter in the mailbox, telling her it is 2004.  She replies with a dated photo, telling him of a freak snowstorm from April 3, 2004 when everyone got sick.<br /><br />When the snow storm appears on that date, Alex's interest is obviously peaked.  They begin to correspond regularly, by dropping letters in the Lake House mailbox, although both do not understand how it is possible.  The dog's name is Jack, and both of Alex and Kate seem to share Jack.  It is very interesting to see the play of how things work around time in the movie as Alex and Kate fall in love from a distance.  A sub-plot is Alex and his brother's relationship with their grouchy, cold, unaffectionate father, played by veteran actor Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />Is this romance just an impossible fantasy?  Can time be bent, somehow, to cross the paths of two people who are two years apart?  Is there hope?  Is anything REALLY impossible; or is it just highly improbable (as my brother used to say)?<br /><br />Personally, I think ALL things are possible.sible.

B002AWJEU8|5.0|I've been a guitar fan for decades and admired Steve for years.  This is the most unbelievable instrumental concert footage I have ever seen.  Technically, editing, camera work, vibe, back-up artists, sound, and song writing.  Have watched 25 times and still can't get enough.  Do yourself a favor and buy.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This DVD is great to have around the house.  I couldn't see myself doing this DVD religiously, but it's a great compliment to any workout program.  I personally loved the 30-day workout BOOK by Jillian, but those routines would usually keep me at least 45 minutes at the gym.  This DVD is nice because you can do this at home within about 25 minutes. It's a tough workout and will make you feel good after you complete it.  Great price, it's a must have!
B002UNMWAG|1.0|I don't want to waste anymore time on this film than I already wasted in the theater so I'll make this quick. I liked the first one, it was pretty funny, had some cool gun play, likable characters, and a good story. However, it also had some bad dialogue, some atrocious acting, some crazy plot holes, over the top camerawork that added nothing to the story at many points in time, and very little subtlety.  Boondock 2 has none of the good of the first, and all of the bad. We are introduced to uninteresting characters, poorly written and poorly acted who take up majority of the story, the original Saints are hardly in the film at all. Willem Defoe and Billy Connoly are are wasted is their poorly written, unsubtle scenes. The music shrieks of late 90s. The action sequences are so confusing that they become boring. Shots are literally repeated, one after the other, for no reason except to watch the violence again. There is nothing redeeming about this film at all cinematically. In essence, the film talks down to the audience and treats us like children who need everything explained in small words. It is offensively unsubtle and demeaning to the audience.  EDIT: Instead of just disagreeing with me, try commenting with merits of this film.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|I ordered this in early January and am still waiting for it! I hope its all a technical glitch but I haven't received an explanation or anything about why it never arrived.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Sade is one of the music world's most enigmatic and underrated superstars. I cannot believe it's 25 years since \\"Hang on to your love\\" first stormed the airwaves. Back then Reagan was President, records came out in vinyl or cassette and the closest thing to a Ipod or mp3 was the Sony Walkman! Our World has almost completely changed in every aspect except one - Sade. Her songs, sultry voice and ability to strike a profound emotional chord upon us the listeners transcends time!!!    It's been 10 years since \\"Lover's Rock\\" debuted with the now classic singles \\"By your side\\", \\" King of Sorrow\\" and \\"Flow.\\" Needless to say,I've been waiting for this one since last summer when I first heard the news of the band collaborating in the studio...    HERE'S THE FANTASTIC NEWS:     A \\"SOLDIER OF LOVE\\" does not disappoint. Each of the 10 tracks are well written, produced and can be played on their own.     The magic of this album is when you realize that together they form an even larger picture. The album is all about love triumphing over pain.     From the lead single, Sade proclaims \\"I am Love's soldier / I wait for the sound / I know that love will come / turn it all around.\\" It's as if Sade is pleading to those who have had their hearts broken that she too has been there & knows how it feels but that you need to continue to be strong and believe that everything will be alright. On another deeper level its as if Sade is singing to our soldiers on the battleground that in times of sheer loneliness not to despair but remember what they are truly fighting for.     \\"Babyfather\\" is another faster tempo song done in a reggae style and featuring vocal accompaniment by her daughter Ila and Clay Matthewman (Stuart's brother?).     \\"Long Hard Road\\" is a melodic and hauting song for anyone who has lost a loved one or struggled to just make it through the day. This track would be perfect for a blockbuster film on the big screen. It also captures the feeling of our current times.    \\"Bringme home\\" is my personal favourite and rumored second single. Here Sade gives us an intimate look into her life and personal struggles. With guitars and a fast-paced drum sequencing Sade declares: \\" I've cried for the lives I've lost / Like a child in need of love / I've been so close but far away from God / My tears flow like a child's in need of love.\\" Have we not also felt like that sometime?    The Bad:  I can think of only one fault. This cd clocks in at only 41 minutes. After 10 years, I would have hoped that Sade would add some videos or bonus tracks or remixes in thanks for all her patient fans. But Sade is a perfectionist. For her its quality over quantity and who am I to fault that noble virtue!    Finally:  THIS CD has the BEST artwork and booklet in her entire catalogue. The photos of her band, scenery etc, compliment the music perfectly and for that reason I would recommend that you buy the cd instead of downloading it. You will not regret it!
B001UW58WW|5.0|Bravo, to David Garrett. A great selection that demonstrates Mr. Garrett's versatility and power. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a strong performance.
0920668364|5.0|I read this book to my 3 sons as they were growing up.  Now that they are grown and having babies of their own I wanted them to have their own copies so they can read it to their babies. Very touching story.

B00288KNL8|5.0|Coraline is a chilling and excellently filmed nailbiting nightmare.  Every child wishes their life could be a bit better, parents more involved, the world about them a bit more beautiful.  Coraline receives her wish in the form of the world beyond a secretive little door in her new apartment.  There's an alternative universe that exists, where Mom is a chef and Dad is a magically inclined piano player.  Dinner is always beautifully cooked and on the table and there is always time for her 'other' parents to remember and amuse Coraline.  But, even in the most perfect of worlds, there is a dark side that exists.  It doesn't take long for Coraline to realize the sinister nature of the 'button-eyed' parents that wish to keep her.<br /><br />This film might be a little bit frightening for children under the age of 7.
B002TSIMEC|1.0|We NEVER received this book!!!  Not sure where the fault lies, but it was truly \\"LOST\\".  We ended up going to WalMart to purchase it for Christmas gift.  Makes me not trust the process of ordering on line or the tracking.
068485743X|5.0|Once you have read many other how-to books, and many good novels (analyzing how they work), you may want to write your own.  After your first or second draft, you'll want to join a writers group, so they'll expose your blind spots and your novel's bruises.  Assuming you learn, and make adjustments, you'll then want to refer to this book.  (Hopefully by that point you will have read it.)  Because the next logical step is sending your manuscript to an agent or editor.  You've written a great novel, why not publish it?    An editor or agent will most likely apply the principals Lukeman describes to reject your manuscript as quickly as possible.  Lukeman presents them in a unique order: What he checks for first, and if the manuscript passes, what he checks for next, et cetera.  If you've written a good novel, don't you want an editor or agent to read the whole thing before passing judgment?  If so, this book can give you a fighting chance to get that far.
0307593525|5.0|I recieved this for Christmas and have since made a number of the recipes. EVERY SINGLE ONE is outstanding.  This not for the faint of heart or the novice cook.  Julia can be a bit anal but her food is worth the effort.  Bon Appetit!
0439023483|5.0|You don't need me to tell you- this series is fabulous.  If edge-of-your-seat story telling, interesting believable characters, thought-provoking yet terrifying scenarios, and hard-to-ignore modern culture parallels interest you at all.<br />The first book kept me up reading all night in the bathroom, but the second was even better if that is possible.  I am so worried that Suzanne won't be able to satisfy all her fans with the wrap-up coming out soon.  Can't wait!
0385504225|5.0|My niece asked me to order this for a friend for Christmas.  It was a last minute thing so I didn't think we would get it in time, but we did.  I hope her friend liked it, but we were pleased with the quick delivery.
0545123267|4.0|I recently wrote a not-so rave review for \\"Beautiful Creatures\\"  stating that I just can't understand the hype for it.  \\"Shiver\\" I get.  The characters are teenagers and so are sometimes shallow, sometimes hysterical and all the time trying to find themselves and the way they fit into the world.  It is a never-tiring theme that we all want to be loved completely for ourselves.<br />Although I'm starting to wonder if all teenage girls want to be stalked.  Secretly.  As long as the stalker is a vampire or a werewolf and has amazingly high morals.  :)  I've been comfortably married to my best friend for ten years so it is hard to remember...
B0000669JL|5.0|I ordered the CD shortly before Christmas, not expecting to get it before Christmas and I did.  I was very happy because my husband wanted that for Christmas and he loves it.
0446567329|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am not a re-reader. My philosophy is why re-read when you can read something new, right? But when I saw the re-release of Dear John by Nicholas Sparks (with Channing Tatum on the cover!!) and the fact that a movie was made based on the novel, I wanted to revisit John and Savannah.<br /><br />I think it goes without saying that Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors. If Sparks writes it, I will read it. His books are on my auto-buy list. It all started with the movie The Notebook. I was completely and utterly captivated with Noah and Allie's story. I wanted more. When I found out the movie was based on a novel, I went to the bookstore and picked it up and read my very first Nicholas Sparks novel. Then I read At First Sight, True Believer, Message in a Bottle....the list goes on and on. I fell in love with his writing style, the characters and with North Carolina (the state itself is a character in its own right in each of his novels). Sparks has a way of getting the reader immersed in his story, longing for more. He has a knack for pulling the reader right into the story.<br /><br />Dear John is story of love, loss and emotion. It is a story that begs the question 'what if...?'. What if you took a different path in life? Would you still end up at the same destination? What if you made the wrong choice? Would you live to regret it? And what about the tougher questions, like how long would you wait for the one you love? Can love survive the distance?<br /><br />John is a bit of a rebel but never fell too far off the right path. He was raised by his father, though the two weren't all that close. John had a hard time relating to his father. His father's coin collecting hobby kept them close for a short while. Over time, the two grew further apart. After high school, John realized he wasn't going anywhere in life so he enlisted with the Army for a 4-year tour.<br /><br />Savannah is a girl who is pure and full of naïve innocence. She's an all-around good girl; you could even call her a goody two-shoes. She lives in a small town and is very close to her parents. She dreams of opening up a horse ranch for autistic kids. It is on a break from school, when she's volunteering for Habit for Humanity, that she meets John and the two fall quickly in love.<br /><br />Neither John or Savannah were expecting to fall in love but their attraction was inevitable. His two-week furlough is up and he has to return to Germany. Savannah promises to wait for John to finish out his tour. The two continue their relationship through handwritten letters. Savannah writes first.<br /><br />  Dear John,<br /><br />  \\"There's so much I want to say to you, but I'm not sure where I should begin. Should I start by telling you that I love you? Or that the days I've spent with you have been the happiest in my life? Or that in the short time I've know you, I've come to believe that we were meant to be together? I could say all those things and all would be true, but as I reread them, all I can think is that I wish I were with you now, holding your hand and watching for your elusive smile.\\"<br /><br />The two continue their relationship through romantic letters, then the events of 9/11 happen and John re-enlists. The distance and time apart put a toll on their relationship. And the questions of \\"what if...?\\" begin.<br /><br />Dear John is one of my favorite reads by Nicholas Sparks. It is a story you will not soon forget. You will cry. Your heart will ache. You will find yourself asking  \\"what if...?\\". Dear John is about a love lost but not forgotten. I don't agree with some of the choices made by either John or Savannah but John's selfless act at the end of the story made me proud. Have the tissues ready! If you love a good, seamless love story that pulls on your heart strings, then you need to read Dear John. In fact, you need to read everything by Nicholas Sparks. His stories of timeless, endless love will captivate your heart and stay with you.

0439023483|5.0|I read this book a few months ago, and I keep coming back to Amazon to try and find other books like it. I was sooooo intrigued by this adventourous story. I read it in about 2 days! The 2nd one wasn't AS good, but it was still fantastic too! I don't know a single person who hasn't loved this book and I HIGHLY reccommend you read it. It's pretty brutal and gorey, but totally worth it the whole way through!  Great job by Suzanne Collins...she really captures the story in a great way, and there isn't too much detail or too little detail! READ IT
1591843162|1.0|This is not a comment on the book, it is on the decision to have the \\"Amazon Exclusive\\" review be done by Hugh MacLeod. Probably a terribly nice guy - but since he is the book's illustrator, it is hard to see him as objective. Perhaps he is, but since neither Amazon nor he disclose his relationship to the book when providing his review, it reeks of conflict. If anyone at Amazon is reading this, I would be happy to remove the review if appropriate disclosures are made.
B001N26GFM|5.0|I have developed an interest in this particular period of history and some years ago gave a speech on the subject of the Holocaust. I have an intimate and wide ranging   knowledge of the atrocities committed during this time; but nothing , no documentary, no book, no article, no personal recollection has had a more profound affect upon me. This film tore me apart and I am so glad that someone had the vision to write the book and bring it to the screen. This is uniquely wonderful film and I wonder whether I will see the like of it again. You do not so much watch this film, as feel it, as you walk in Bruno's steps. An experience I will never forget and am grateful to have had.
044024367X|1.0|After getting my Kindle and then reading great reviews on the Reacher series I started reading and tore through the first nine in no time.  But then in the last novel we learn that Reacher makes an instant judgement that PETA must be a great organization.  Just a single line, but a statement nonetheless.  A warning signal that the politics were soon to follow.      \\"Nothing to Lose\\" lets it all out. We get it, Child is a leftist.  Fine, but kinda weird if you ask me for the character he created.  Filled with ridiculous politics and certain to turn off the majority of Reacher fans.  Leftists are always so certain of their ideals that real facts never get in their way.  Other reviewers have addressed the particulars like where are the \\"real-world deserters\\" and why are the terroists always the Christians in novels, but not so in the real world?      Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.

I plan to share this book with my class at the end of the year in a read-aloud format.  What a great story -- appealing to both girls and boys.  Suzanne Collins really knows the formula for catching a young adolescent reader's attention, as well as this 51-year-old reader!
B002YIHO7I|5.0|The space and time between this and Sade's previous album [[ASIN:B000051VWW Lovers Rock]] the world changed in the most unexpected of ways. As with much of life the music world has come into something of a standstill,especially when it comes to the R&B world. It's come to the point where,at least in my case where I find myself on mission trying to find significant elements in music probably more created to sell than inspire. Well I don't mind-it's a worthy mission that sometimes unearths hidden intentions sometimes. But it's also a big relief to be able to tell people that an album is just really a good choice for music lovers. True this is an album I've been anticipating long before I knew it was coming out. That aside this album not only matched my expectations but in a lot of ways exceeded it. Sade has been known for a timeless sound as the Amazon.com review implied and that in a word is one of the reasons I was so looking forward to this. The title song of this album was an early reason for peaking my interest. It's a darly romantic slice of Sade style smooth funk that has a little more drama with it's use of some orchestral fanfares and the like and contains perfect metaphores for the themes of this album. Not only is Sade herself \\"in the wild,wild west doing her best\\" (this isn't the first time that's been said of course) but also \\"lost the use of her heart but is still alive\\". Not only does that show the bands musically and lyrically poetic flavors have not in any way abandoned them but also that their aware of how much contemporary life and thinking has effected music around them as well. There is a similar flavor on \\"The Moon In The Sky\\",\\"Long Hard Road\\",\\"Bring Me Home\\" and \\"Skin\\". The music on these songs is by no means as stripped down as what was on the previous album but the condundrum of worldweary romanticism has been stepped up a notch here and it goes well with the times it's recorded in.. \\"Babyfather\\" is another great example of that-a very bright caribbean flavored groove is married to a lyrical reflection on paternity. \\"Be That Easy\\" and \\"In Another Time\\" have a musical styling fairly new to Sade;an extention on American country/gospel style ballad that doesn't bare a resemblence to the jazzier styles that they've been known for and that are here as well on \\"Morning Bird\\" and \\"The Safest Place\\".

And if I may say so it's good to hear new music from them again.example of that-a very bright caribbean flavored groove is married to a lyrical reflection on paternity. \\"Be That Easy\\" and \\"In Another Time\\" have a musical styling fairly new to Sade;an extention on American country/gospel style ballad that doesn't bare a resemblence to the jazzier styles that they've been known for and that are here as well on \\"Morning Bird\\" and \\"The Safest Place\\".

B001E2JNA6|5.0|I just read a review here complaining that the new transfer wasn't saturated enough and should match the old VHS version more!<br /><br />Rubbish! This is a superior high-definition transfer. The old VHS was absolutely terrible, and I suspect the reviewer may be clueless insofar as to what constutes cinema-like transfer quality. The VHS box was so lousy that it was the very reason I hesitated to buy this new Blu-ray.<br /><br />I needn't have worried, as every frame of this transfer is perfect--sharp and delicately balanced. You MUST set your HDTV to the proper color temperature of course, usually the \\"film\\" or \\"movie\\" setting. I suspect the hapless reviewer I mention has completely blown out the picture out, like the most callous, wrongheaded WalMart or Best Buy do in setting up their TV display section...
B000V8A95C|5.0|Awesome album.  Every time I listen to it it's like I'm watching the musical again.  The music does a great job of painting a visual of what's happening on stage.  This is one of the few albums I can listen to in its entirety over and over again.  And it still gets me emotional!
0307266303|5.0|I am not a runner and was reluctant to read this book, but it got my attention after only a few pages. McDougall has written an inspiring, entertaining and educational book about running and the Tarahumara, a tribe in Mexico. I was incredulous when I heard that the book was a page turner. How can a nonfiction book about running create suspense? McDougall does it! You will laugh, be amused and learn from this delightful book. He examines running from cultural, historical, physiological, physical and psychological angles. Highly recommended for runners and non-runners.
0439023483|5.0|I read this book November 2008 but I had to do a review on it here because it was AWESOME. My definition of awesome may be different than other people's, but this book was just ... great.<br /><br />It is based on a post-apocalyptic North America that has already endured wars over remaining resources and then a government arose called \\"The Capitol\\" and organized 13 districts across the continent. Needless to say the districts did not like the capitol so they formed a rebellion. Well, the capitol won by a landslide because they have all the money and technology and they completely annihilated district 13 - leaving nothing alive. Anyway, to make sure that the districts never form any such rebellion again The Capitol holds the annual Hunger Games to remind everyone that they are in charge.<br /><br />The Hunger games begin by having a lottery and they pick 1 girl and 1 boy from each district between the ages of 12 and 18 to compete in these hunger games (so a total of 24 contestants). So you wonder, \\"How does holding a competition make people stay in line?\\" The answer is simple, it's a fight to the death.<br /><br />They hold the competition in a huge arena that varies in landscape from year to year. The desert, mountains, etc. It's a huge arena that use tiny cameras to catch all the excitement and the game makers can control all the variables. If things aren't interesting enough for those watching they can start a massive forest fire, or unleash some rabid beast. The last remaining contestant is the victor and they are granted fame and glory.<br /><br />The book starts on the day of the 79th annual Hunger Games lottery.<br /><br />The rest of the book is completely unpredictable which is why I liked it so much. When I put it down Sunday night to go to bed my brain kept trying to figure out ways that the book could possibly end up and out of all the ways it came up with ... it never did figure out the actual story line.<br /><br />Anyway, the only bad part about the book was when I found out it's the first book in a trilogy so there will be 2 more books to come. The next one - Catching Fire - came out in Sept 2009 and the last book comes out August 24, 2010.<br /><br />The first book does stand alone ... there is a definite \\"ending\\", but then you read the last page and you wish you would have stopped reading just 1 page earlier because now you have to wait another year to figure out how the story \\"really ends\\" and then another year after that to find out how THAT story ends.<br /><br />I really hate waiting.trilogy so there will be 2 more books to come.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|Fantastic work! Just a quick note to say yes, this DVD DOES have the extra scenes that were missing from the Masterpiece Theatre presentation on PBS.  These are some very wonderful and necessary scenes--you will not be disappointed!
B0035V35P8|3.0|I knew going in that a movie with a title like this not to expect Shakespeare, and I was right.  This is one of those movies where the action is great (and it is great) and the plot exists mainly to get us to the next fight.  What I will give credit to are a series of flashbacks showing the protagonist's training and his relationship with a girl there.  This gives the plot some emotional weight to it, and I thought the ending scene was a nice way to finish the film.  Unless you're a hardcore martial arts fan, you are probably better off just renting it.
0316044938|2.0|This novel is less about a murder of a young girl than it is about the effect such a brutal crime has on the members of the victim's family.  Not sure we needed this novel to educate us on the fact that violent crimes scar more people than the immediate victims.  And strangely, the book seems to suggest the victim is oh so lucky to have been murdered because she is so happy to be in her magical heaven. I give this book two stars instead of one because it is hard to shake and the author is very talented in telling her story. But, for me, her talents cannot overcome a story which has too many negative threads. For most, there's enough suffering taking place in the real world. But if you are the sort who likes downer books, you'll LOVE this one.

B002MBAJ4M|4.0|This is a strong set of rock tracks by a very talented band that jams.  Became a fan of Haynes' guitar work after he joined The Allman Brothers Band and began buying Govt Mule cds but have never considered myself a fan of the band.  This album may change that. It's the best album in the genre since 2003's Hittin' the Note. But don't be misled.  This isn't a \\"southern rock\\" album as much as it is a album recorded by some southern guys who rock. Haynes' guitar talents are on display on every track - and right away! The first track, Broke Down of the Brazos, builds off the energy and grind provided by new bassist Carlsson to produce one of the best rock songs in years. Haynes has an obvious love for Hendrix/Vaughan as evidenced by Inside Outside Woman but stays closer to home with this album  than his more adventurous colleague from The Allman Brothers, Derek Trucks, does with his solo work.  If your idea of a great Saturday is a cooler of cold Buds, some sun, some friends, and some great American rock, buy this. You'll love it.

Sections on filled cupcakes(like a boston cream cupcake, black forest cupcake, etc), diped and iced, special occasion cupcakes, decorating tips, ideas for how to present the little cakes, useful how-to pictures, and a back section with everything you need to know before you start your baking adventure! Not to mention the fact that cupcakes are the cat's pajamas.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This film is so memorable and meaningful that I had to have it in my collection of notable motion pictures.  I loved the acting, the music, the direction, the incorporation of Indian film techniques and the overall quality of the production.  A truly important film for all time.
B000X107GI|5.0|Could not be more pleased with this seller/product.  When one of these costs more in a Brick&Mortar store than 5 of these online, there should be nothing more to say.  Will be back in the future.
B002Q9MZHE|1.0|It's inconceivable, a terrible production with no chemistry no soul, everything else is being said by other reviewers. I like Rolando Villazon and Anna Netrebko, great voices and a lot of passion in most of their performances. Opera is about soul and for sure not about bad movie making. Puccini's masterpiece raped.
1591843162|5.0|I enjoyed the book immensely.  This book in some ways reminds me of what Dan Pink has been saying for years now. The work environment HAS changed and we need to change with it or get left in the dust. If you are lazy and want a feel good book don't bother picking this up.  There are no short cuts to success, but hard work can also be fun and rewarding. Seth has a nack for teaching in an entertaining fun way.  Pick this book up if you want to make a difference in your life.   Cheers

B002YIHO7I|2.0|The album is boring! I cant tell you how disappointed I was. The single was certainly good and I thought the CD would have that flavor throughout. But the songs instead of having unique qualities and different instrumentation all just run together. They are all slow songs, almost depressing sounding without any hook or catch to them! I don't believe Sade spent many years making this CD. I think she started about a year ago and basically took the other 9 years off. This CD is almost number one but there are going to be a lot of people let down by it once they hear it. I LOVE the old albums and Love Deluxe although full of ballads had emotional quality and life to it. It was very lush and beautiful. These songs seem uninspired. There's an old saying if you don't use it, you lose it as may be the case with Sade. I felt like at the time I was the odd one and wasn't that crazy about Lovers Rock, so many other people seem to like it (and it went triple platinum). But I have to say compared to Soldier Of Love, Lovers Rock isn't bad. The tour was certainly enjoyable although the Lovers Live CD had too much crowd noise in it. Her classic albums are all tremendous though. There are a few good songs on Soldier of Love, the title song is very catchy unique single, The Moon & The Sky is a nice ballad with some good music in it, Morning Bird has a nice reggae feel to it. But the rest of the CD is slow, dull, and predictable. A few songs like these wouldn't have been bad to throw in like \\"In Another Time\\" or \\"Skin\\" for example with some better songs added in and a slightly longer album. But every other song is the same, same tone, half a dozen times over!  If Sade can pull this off and have another triple platinum blockbuster like Lover's Rock, than she is an artist who excels beyond her material. I see only Gold or Platinum here and than a loss of interest!
B0027BOL4G|1.0|I bought this movie based on all the good reviews. What a waste of money. Unless your head has been buried in the sand over the past decades, there is absolutely nothing newsworthy or of value to the movie. I just do not understand all the high rated reviews.
0307454541|5.0|In this exciting thriller from Sweden (warning! translation!) aging industrialist Henrik Vanger hires Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist who's been found guilty (yes guilty--it's a crime in Sweden apparently) of libeling another industrialist. Eventually Blomkvist brings in the tattooed, body-pierced young woman of the title, Elisabeth Salander, who has already been introduced to the reader, and in rather dramatic fashion. Blomkvist's job is ostensibly to write a family history, although actually it's to find out what has happened to Vanger's niece Harriet, who disappeared nearly 40 years before. It's a classic locked-room puzzle. She seems to have disappeared from an island at a time when access coming and going was blocked off because of a traffic accident, and she is presumed to have been murdered and her body somehow disposed of.<br /><br />Of course, they do solve the puzzle.<br /><br />But the destination doesn't matter, it's the journey during which the pair encounter people pleasant (seldom), unpleasant (often), and just plain nuts (a couple of times). It's exciting enough, and the ingenious ways in which the sociopathic heroine gets revenge is a kick. I enjoyed it, but the book is stuffed with pornoviolence that will put some readers off. Way off. And some readers, perhaps some of the same ones, will object to the amorality of it all.<br /><br />Salander is one of detective fiction's most fascinating crime fighter. She's an expert computer hacker with a photographic memory, but she's sociopathic, malevolent, almost impossible to get along with, and seems to have no sense of right and wrong. She trusts nobody, and seems to have but one rule: cross her and she'll get her revenge.<br /><br />Try it.<br /><br />Notes and asides: Throughout, the author tosses in statistics about the violence committed against women in his country. They are frightening.
0307266303|5.0|Very few books change my perspective on things easily....this book is definitely one of them. I read this cover to cover, word for word, right through the night. Chris might actually have delivered one of the best books of our times. Though the book is based on running and our preconceptions of it, the underlying message is powerfully human applicable to almost everyone. Stop everything and read it now!
B00001OH7T|2.0|I'm a moderate Bowie fan, having about half of his discography. This is not up to par. Besides the fighty rendition of \\"across the Universe\\" (nobody signs \\"nothing's gonna change my world\\" like the King :)) and the OK \\"Fame\\", the rest is commercial, and badly so. I don't know what happened to him. I'm glad Amazon's Dan Epstein put it so well: \\"transitional step (...), not a great record\\". One feels so much better when \\"somebody up there agres with you :)\\".<br /><br />There are many other better Bowie albums. This is for fans only. Maybe if you like \\"Soul funk\\" also.

B00005JKN9|5.0|Having seen his father killed in a major gang fight in New York, young Amsterdam Vallon is spirited away for his own safety. Some years later, he returns to the scene of his father's death, the notorious Five Points district in New York. It's 1863 and lower Manhattan is run by gangs, the most powerful of which is the Natives, headed by Bill \\"The Butcher\\" Cutting. He believes that America should belong to native-born Americans and opposes the waves of immigrants, mostly Irish, entering the city. It's also the time of the Civil War and forced conscription leads to the worst riots in US history. Amid the violence and corruption, young Vallon tries to establish himself in the area and also seek revenge over his father's death. \\"Gangs of New York\\" is just perfect entertainment. It is an enthralling, bloody, melodramatic epic. A movie that spins another tale of the New York underworld but, with a twist. Instead of the mid-twentieth century organized crime, This movie ventures back to the 19th century to show  the origin of the modern street gang. This movie is fantastic, and should not to be missed.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|Paolo Nutini is fantastic. Different types of music. Out of the box music. I love it!
B00008G7UJ|5.0|Classic story of Romeo and Juliet, set in a modern-day city of Verona Beach. The Montagues and Capulets are two feuding families, whose children meet and fall in love. They have to hide their love from the world because they know that their parents will not allow them to be together. There are obstacles on the way, like Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, and Romeo's friend Mercutio, and many fights. The casting of Leonardo Di Caprio as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet both give the best performance. A fantastic soundtrack with a stunning backdrop of 'Verona Beach'. Right from the explosive beginning to the tragic ending, Romeo and Juliet will keep you captivated. Although it is set in modern times, it is still the timeless story of the \\"star crossed lovers\\".  If you are a fan of artistic movies then make sure to look at this one. A beautiful modernization of Shakespeare's classic play.
0307269981|4.0|I  was fascinated by the layer upon layer of mystery and intrigue.  After becoming familiar with the names of the characters, the reading became smoother and easier.  Perhaps the author went a little too far in the description of the physical punishment of the girl. Each character became more real as the story progressed and the plot deepened.
B000LC55F2|5.0|In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier, his beloved wife Julia McCullough and Alfred Borden are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences. The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. A movie with the power of becoming a cult classic, ''The Prestige'' is magical. In every sense of the word.

B000JLTRIQ|5.0|On September, 11th 2001, after the terrorist attack to the World Trade Center, the building collapses over the rescue team from the Port Authority Police Department. Will Jimeno and his sergeant John McLoughlin are found alive trapped under the wreckage while the rescue teams fight to save them. It is a powerful movie that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks. There are tears of joy, laughs, and tears of sorrow interlaced throughout this movie with Strong acting from a huge cast including Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena. This movie is not ground-breaking work, but it wasn't meant to be. It was meant to tell the story of a few brave men and their families and their experiences during September 11th, and it accomplished this very well.
0307341569|5.0|This book is dark, disturbing and brilliant.  I loathed nearly every character in this novel and I have known someone like every character in this novel. Read it when you're not in the mood for something light and festive...
B00080ZG1A|5.0|The movie begins as a young Hughes directs one of Scorsese's favorite films, Hell's Angels. Hughes was so obsessed with perfection in the aerial sequences that he waits forever for perfect conditions, right down to cloud formations. The Aviator ends in 1946, when Hughes was still a dashing young man and romancing actresses like Ava Gardner and Katharine Hepburn. This is an astonishingly beautiful and moving movie. The story traces the rise and demise of billionaire Howard Hughes as he struggles to find meaning and purpose in a life unfettered by concerns of money, talent or opportunity. DiCaprio is amazing and Cate Blanchett is incredible as Katherine Hepburn.  This isn't a love story, it's a war story, a war between Howard's unstoppable will, and his fierce inner demons battling for Howard's soul. It is the major relationship and the true heart of the movie, one that fuels his eccentric genius and yet constantly threatens to rip his life apart. He tries to outrun it, building faster and faster airplanes. A great american tragedy.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|\\"Inglourious Basterds\\"<br />Directed by Quentin Tarrantino<br />(2009)<br />----------------------------------------------<br />In this delicious genre film, Quentin Tarrantino pays tribute to the classic war movies of the 1950s and '60s, made with the same grandiose aura of faux-epic presentation, draped over a palpably ridiculous plot. The film opens slowly, with Tarrantino employing great restraint and craftsmanship, using beautiful landscape cinematography and slow, deliberate pacing. The camera lingers on the brilliant Austrian actor Christoph Waltz (who steals the show: he was nominated for a \\"supporting actor\\" Oscar, but he is clearly the movie's real star, playing a vain, sadistic SS officer who loves elaborate cat-and-mouse games.)<br /><br />Tarrantino also uses misdirection in the film -- the Dirty Dozen-ish commando group of the film's title actually get little screen time, and are quickly decimated by their Nazi foes; Brad Pitt, the nominal star of the show, does very little onscreen and has few lines (although he looks a lot like Clark Gable, which is fun...)  Also, despite the marketing campaign, there isn't that much graphic violence: again, this is probably a conscious homage to the war epics of the '60s, which featured a lot of set-up before their Rube Goldberg-like climaxes, where the grand plan unfolds. The ending, which is preposterous and ahistorical, is a real hoot, a gratifying anti-Nazi wish-fulfillment... Like the film itself, it's pure entertainment and fantasy. And why not? Isn't that what films are supposed to be about?  This isn't immortal art, but it sure is a fun movie. If you grew up watching old war films on Saturday afternoons and afterschool TV blocks, then this flick is for you. Tarrantino really nailed it.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B0000640VN|5.0|Kate and her actor brother live in N.Y. in the 21st Century. Her ex-boy friend, Stuart, lives above her apartment and finds this space near the Brooklyn Bridge where there is a gap in time. He goes back to the eighteen hundreds and takes pictures of the place. Leopold, a man living in the 1870's, was puzzled by Stuart's tiny camera and decides to follow him and they both ended up in this century. Leopold is clueless about his new surroundings. He gets help and insights from Charlie who thinks that Leopold is an actor who is always in character. Leopold is a highly intelligent man and tries his best to learn and even improve the modern conveniences that he encounters. This movie is refreshing, with a new type of concept, and all of the writing and acting are wonderfully done. Leopold will sweep you off your feet and steal your heart away.

B001FB55LW|4.0|WHILE THE CONCEPT MAY BE THE SAME AS LIAR LIAR, THE THING THAT GETS ME TO KEEP WATCHING THIS FLICK IS THE CAST OF THE MOVIE. THEY REALLY GO TOE TO TOE WITH CARREY. THE OTHER THING THAT I LIKED WAS THE SPECIAL FEATURES. YOU GET A BEHIND THE SCENES LOOK, A FEW MUSIC VIDEOS FEATURING ZOOEY DECHANEL AND A FEW INTERVIEWS. THE ONLY KNOCK I HAVE IS THE MOVIE DOESNT HAVE AN AUDIO COMMENTARY BY THE ACTORS OR THE DIRECTOR. I WISH THEY WOULD OF DONE ONE BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE LOVE TO HEAR THE BACKSTORY OF THIS MOVIE. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THIS MOVIE WAS BASED OFF OF TRUE EVENTS, SOME GUY ONE DAY DECIDED TO SAY YES TO EVERYTHING AND I PERSONALLY WOULD OF LIKED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT. OVERALL THIS MOVIE IS WORTH BUYING IF YOUR A FAN OF JIM CARREY OR JUST WANT TO SIT BACK AND WATCH A FUN FILM.
B0016PM722|5.0|My boyfriend is really into Star Wars so I got him this for his birthday and he loves it! Sometimes I'll see him running around acting like a Jeti. Its so cool the way it was built, and the the lighting effect makes it even better. Sometimes we will turn off the lights and play with its cause when you move it you see the path. It also feels real unlike the cheap plastic one so you really get what you pay for. I'm really not that into Star Wars but I want on just because its cool.

B0013ND30M|4.0|It worked great for the first several months, but now for some odd reason it won't play towards the end. It just skips and won't play the last 10 minutes. I cleaned it, looked for scratches and there were not any, so I have no idea if its just my DVD player (although all other movies play fine) or if its just because the movie is just very well used/loved and needs to be replaced now. Either way, I am still happy it got here in time for Christmas and my kids loved it while it lasted.
B0007OY2P8|5.0|I bought a BBC boxed set of all the Jane Austen stories and loaned this one to a friend.  The friend returned it to the local library, what a dope.  I was hoping that this would fit into my boxed set case and it did, perfectly.  As for the production?  Not the best but one can't judge a vendor by the movie itself.  I knew it was mediocre when I ordered it.  The important thing for me was to fill the void in my complete collection, quickly.  The DVD arrived in just a few days even though I did parcel post.  Awesome delivery time, packaging could have been better but good enough.  Arrived in good condition.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|Very well directed and filmed....excellent casting and acting...happy to see it filmed  at a real mansion, real gardens and gorgeous scenes of the moors. And fairly true to the original story.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|I've long been a fan Loreena McKennitt and she always amazes me with her music.  The instruments, many a lot of people have never seen or know what are, add a unique beauty to her music that can not be matched.  The \\"Seven Rejoices of Mary\\" was one of my favorite off the CD.  If you like Loreena, then you'll definitely enjoy this and it'll add a special touch to your next Christmas.  I'll enjoy mine for many years to come.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book rates up there with my all time favorites.  One of the very few I will read again. She draws you into Henrietta and her family's lives making you want to learn more.  And you do learn with this novel.  It was so interesting. I am a voracious reader of all types of books and with my kindle I seem to read more, so for me to rate this book (a first!!!!) is a lot.
B00319ECHE|5.0|I'm a serious metalhead: at any given moment, any speakers within range of my person are pumping out unforgiving double bass barrages, highlighted with vocal strains ranging from clean, to shrill, to guttural, as guitars grind out churning riffs or nigh-operatic solos. Metal acts as the background for my life, informing my political and spiritual viewpoints as well as providing inspiration for everyday life.    But I have to say, despite this passion (or obsession) the scene seems to be uninspiring even with all of the newer metal acts coming out as of late. They all seem to be caught up in a war to determine whose music, both technically and lyrically, makes the least sense. Entire albums lack rythm, let alone emotion, in spite of the furious thrashing of the young band members.    Which is why, time and again, I find myself praising the metal gods that older acts keep creating new work. And I'm not talking about Metallica: as much better as Death Magnetic was than St. Anger, I'm thinking more along the lines . . . of Fear Factory.    Doing us all a huge favor, the band has switched out Raymond Herrera for a new drummer, as well as brought back classic FF guitarist Dino. Dino brings in his vicious styling from his work with Divine Heresy, and the new drummer beats the crap out of the drums, while still being fast and relentless. Burton lacks the shrill vocal range of more modern metal lyricists, but makes up for it with his signature melodic, clean vocals and guttural growling. On a lyrical level, Bell has fortunately left behind the somewhat wishy-washy spiritual work that pervaded FF's last album - leaving it in the realm of his Ascension of the Watchers project where it belongs. The closest he comes to this former song writing is in Christploitation, a song whose lyrics I fully agree with, if I'm not entirely happy  with the music.    That one flaw aside, Mechanize is both a return to glory for Fear Factory and a lesson from the elder metal gods to newcomers. Innovation is important in anything, but it seems like Fear Factory has perfected the art in its own unique way. I recommend this album to both diehard FF fans (such as myself) to metal neophytes looking for new material or who are simply jaded by today's newer metal acts.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|This is a great example of that odd blend of the slick and the cheesy that was so common among movies made in the late 70s to mid 80s or so, especially horror.  Keith Gordon does the best job here as Arnie, who goes from nerdy and picked on to snotty and dangerous, even downright deadly, after he fixes up an evil car that he names Christine.  The rest of the acting is so-so or just bad.      The visual effects showing Christine restoring herself after being totalled are quite impressive.    Not a bad adaptation, overall.
0451228731|5.0|There is a tremendous amount of confusion about this book, the fact is that this is a two part book with two different titles.  To get the whole story Freedom must be read after Daemon.  That being said I really enjoyed reading about this theme that interests me a lot as computer power continues to increase geometrically, will we reach a point where machines begin to control the real world.  The theory of \\"Singularity\\" argues that this will begin to happen by 2030 when machine intelligence exceeds that of humans.  I hope we never see the world of Daemon but who knows?  I did not like some of the excessive violence, but maybe that is what will guarantee that it becomes a movie.  The story is a little slow in places but it is highly creative and worth sticking with.  I am impressed with the author and will certainly continue to read his future books.
630469654X|5.0|The product arrived in a short amount of time.  It arrived in good order, no scratches and the cover was also in very good shape, almost like new.  Thank you so much for the well preserved product and the prompt service.

B000FZEQSM|5.0|Fantastic movie, keeps you interested and glued throughout. Great acting by cast, more movies like these are needed
0446567337|5.0|I must admit I'm not as big a Sparks fan as so many others. I always felt it was very cookie cutter. But something about this story ( maybe because I am in the military) really touched my heart. I couldn't beleive the way I felt; It was as though the character was going through the story I've heard and seen so many times. It reminded me that love endures. It doesn't matter whether you stay together or split,that love you shared , a piece of them is always with you. I haven't seen the movie yet but hope that it will also inspired that same feeling in me. I would reccomend this book to anyone.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|For the first time, I experienced the real meaning of Dolby TrueHD. And now I can say: WHOW!!! Totally ifferent from DVD, of course, and one of the best I've ever seen.
0316789720|5.0|The pictures are a bit small, but the variety of things one can draw allow scenes to be drawn. Combining all of the images is fun for the kids to make elaborate drawings.
B000UD08HW|5.0|Not only for the music and the magic of Pink Floyd, but the perfect sound for Gilmour's guitar. Awesome!
B0029O08WA|5.0|Love this soundtrack.....My initial reaction was that it wasn't as fantastic as the first one. However, I gave it a chance and it has really grown on me. Very worthy of purchase to all those twihardies out there.
B001AQTWF2|1.0|There isn't a thing wrong with Whitney's voice, she's still got the range (listen to portions of \\"I Look To You\\") and the power.  But, she's gotten lazy and, apparently, is after the quick score with this bubblegum.  She's extremely nasal and several of the songs sound like she's channeling Michael Jackson, the beat is even the same.  Whitney's a balladeer, she should stick to what she's good at and quit prostituting her talent to this kind of crap.  This album is terrible.  I won't buy any more \\"new\\" Whitney.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Got this for my nice for Christmas she was so excited. Funny story: She opened it and goes \\"OHHHHHH I LOVE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\\" ha-ha
B0030BOCEG|5.0|Let me start with saying, HIM is  my favorite band of all time, and I have been an avid fan for years. It is obvious here that Valo and company were looking for a more pop element to this newest album. The choruses get stuck in your head for hours, and honestly this isn't a bad thing. The amazing thing about this album is the movement from ballads such as sacred to death, and disarm me, to the more rocking heartkiller, and like st valentine. People are calling this the sell out album, but who wants to hear the same album being produced every occasion. This album is going to once again put them in the American spotlight, as Dark Light did. This album is closely related to Deep Shadows and Brillant Highlights, with a Mix of Razorblad Romance. Best tracks are Dying Song, Katherine Wheel, Shatter me with Hope, and Scared to Death. It will take some time, but people with eventually accept this album and I feel will become people's favorite HIM album, as it has become mine.
B000002AH9|5.0|This CD Lady in Satin is a five star from the word go. Don't know how I ever missed it because I have many Discs by Billie Holiday. This one goes up near the top. Beautiful love songs with Ray Ellis and his band.
B0030MM68O|3.0|This is a movie about 3 US soldiers in the streets of Bagdad during their last month of rotation in the bomb squad.<br /><br />Its a good movie. I liked it. I wasnt unhappy that I rented it.  I might have even given it four stars had it not been for the massive amounts of 5 star hype this movie was getting.<br /><br />Note to the marketing people - sometimes you can kill your pet project by promising too much. If you brag your coffee, which is really in fact the best tasting coffee in the world - can cure cancer. Guess what?  People completely forget about the good taste and just bash your product because its all BS that it can cure cancer.<br /><br />So stop with the movie of the decade. Stop with the oscar nominee most deserving BS. just stop it. This movie has been made at least 4 times this decade. with another 3 or 4 cable tv stories to go with it. This movie is not unique. HOWEVER, ITS A GOOD MOVIE. WELL Made. Good acting.<br /><br />and thats good enough.
B000H5U832|5.0|DVD was damaged when I received it but the seller immediately refunded my money no questions asked.  I was so pleased to deal with someone that wanted to satisfy their customer and make things right.  Will definitely buy from again!!
B002C6K7NU|5.0|Just damn good rock n' roll - songs are well crafted, they are ballsy, they groove, and quite simply, they rock.  What else could you want?  Great new album from an iconic band.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|This is an excellent concert that was shot before the days of their decline (in my opinion), which was the synth-filled sounds of the eighties. This concert DVD captures the magic of Queen at their greatest. A must-buy!!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Best show on television.  No doubt. Great commentaries except whenever Eliz Moss talks.  She should be quiet and let Hamm and Weiner comment since they are the reason this show is so amazing
B002YIHO7I|2.0|Have been listening to Sade for years .... I was kind of looking forward to this release after hearing the single, Soldier of Love ~ I was really digging that song, and still am.  Received the cd yesterday from Amazon .. not going to say it's a bad album ... it's just not like the \\"older\\" Sade music - which is what I enjoy -- oh well... If you like nice slow easy music, this is great, but if your looking for that old magic - it's not here ...

0143038583|5.0|An amazing book that makes one conscious of everything that is put into our mouths and where it comes from.  And, the long term effects of choices that we are making as a nation with regards to food that need to shift. We need new models of how to live. Which links to a book I recently finished called:  Sustainability:  A personal journey to a built sustainable community ... and an amazing picture of what life will soon be like by Stuart W. Rose, Ph.D. really helped me to learn to think about all the aspects of sustainability (shelter, community,land use)including food. Both authors bring us to a place of change for each of us individually have the ability to affect change and what our choices mean for ourselves and our planet.

1897299214|5.0|In recent years, North Korea has held a prominent place in our collective imaginations as a tiny, isolated Asian country that shares membership in the \\"axis of evil\\" and yet is a country of which little is known. French Canadian cartoonist Guy Delisle travels to this enigmatic country for a two month business trip and attempts to unravel some of the mystery and inconsistencies of life in Communist Korea. His experiences are depicted with simplicity and grace in the graphic novel memoir/travelogue, Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea.    Delisle is sent to North Korea as an animator whose expertise as an animator is valued by the North Koreans. In the process, he learns how things work or don't work in this stark country. He sees and subtly critiques a country where massive buildings go unfinished, highways are without exit ramps, and airports and restaurants are without lights. Delisle's wry humor emerges throughout the story, including telling jokes that are above the heads of his humorless \\"Comrade Guide\\" and \\"Comrade Translator\\" and his habit of throwing paper airplanes out of his 15th floor hotel window. He shows the grim reality of decades of extreme Communism by depicting the monotony of having only one radio station to listen to, being surrounded by ubiquitous statues and images of dictators Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, and choosing from a rather bland selection of restaurants and food.     In an ironic motif throughout the story, he carries around a copy of Orwell's 1984 that he brought with him and eventually gives to his unsuspecting guide. The reader is constantly reminded of connections between the society Orwell describes in his dystopian classic and the realities of life in present day North Korea. It makes the reader wonder if Delisle's reflections are a foreshadowing of the future (as predicted in 1984) or a window into a dying outpost of Communist totalitarian rule.     Even when Delisle questions the inconsistencies of his host country, he maintains not only a sense of humor but he also shows compassion to the local citizens with whom he comes in contact: his guides, the other animators, the restaurant workers, his translator. One gets the feeling that his purpose in telling this story about such a misunderstood country is to expand our understanding of it. He does this with quirky details that give it credibility and he does it by placing himself in the center of the narrative so that he can capture the range of emotions of a confused Westerner living in Pyongyang.  Delisle's balance of critique and empathy make Pyonyang a compelling and memorable read. It complements nicely his other two graphic novels: Burma Chronicles and Shenzen: A Travelogue from China.
B002T921DE|5.0|I've been a George Michaels fan since the early days of WHAM UK!  This concert was great.  Excellent camera work and George was in top form...really.  I highly recommend it.
B000069HKH|5.0|I hesitated to purchase this mostly because of the timing when it was released, shortly after than 9-11, but today I'm glad I got it finally. Thank you.
B00009YOQW|4.0|Sturdy, good sounding, & great for my autistic kid.  Produces sounds that she likes & can engage her independently for 5-10 min.  Good autistic kid toy.  My ratings are based from an autistic kids point of view
B002JODV3S|4.0|Can anyone top Steve Vai for ability and showmanship?  Yes, it's a little cheesy during the first song, but after that he settles down with some amazing musicians to provide an amazing concert.  Only criticism is that if your are going to go Blu-ray, then you need to provide an HD soundtrack.  Dolby Digital is good, but Dolby truHD or DTS-MA would have been spectacular.  Thanks Steve!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|There are no programs like this one on TV anymore. These programs are wholesome stories that are good for family entertainment.  With all of the garbage that is found on TV today these are programs that I can let my children watch and not have to be in the room policing everything that goes on.  The series set was a gift to my wife who loves this show and we are enjoying having good family TV entertainment to watch together.  These are a must buy if you are looking for something to sit and watch with your family on a special night of week like we do.  THe price was great and the delivery was prompt like everything else we have bought from Amazon.  Great buy if you are looking for good family entertainment. You will not be dissapointed.
1439102813|5.0|Tragic -- a terrible disease -- But do read this book as it is a great eye opener.
B000GIWRIY|5.0|They have spent a lot of time remastering their older products lately. This is a good thing because the recording sometimes did not accurately capture Tull's energy. I enjoyed JTull.com too but it felt more like an Ian Anderson solo effort to me. Most of the rest of their recent products have been rehash collections.     I enjoy Ian's solo CDs too and he put on a great performance with his Ian Anderson plays the acoustic Tull tour. The German guitarist he used was very good, but Roots to Branches seemed like the last real Tull album to me. I hope there will be some more though! Beside Myself was an awesome example of Tull arrangement and dynamics usage.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I liked Alec Baldwin's book about his divorce.<br />It resonated with me because my own family is<br />dealing with the faults of our legal system<br />as he did.  It's interesting reading just<br />for the information of what and what not to<br />do during a divorce.  It was a downer, but<br />it was helpful.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Great Product.  It shipped fast and in great condition.  The DVD season itself was very enjoyable with a good amount of extra features.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|It was really wonderful to see this holiday classic re-done in beautiful color, which just makes it all that more Christmas-y for movie-lovers of all ages!  Great Irving Berlin songs!  Definitely add this to your collection of holiday films.
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|I have read a lot of the critical reviews, and those people are entitled to their viewpoints. In my case I don't care if the CD sounds different, or creative, or breaks new ground. I liked their last CD so if this one is more of what I like I don't see that as a negative. The music rocks. The lyrics tend to be a bit crude but that doesn't bother me either. This is a great cd to listen too in the gym or when running. It'll keep you motivated and going.
B0000AFX64|4.0|I was so glad to have this movie.  I used to love the old Battlestar Galactica series.  I'm a big Scifi fan.  The SyFy Channel didn't do this series any justice, or anything else they've done.  I've requested they show some of the good series that used to be on television, like the old Battlestar Galactica series, Seaquest, Knight Rider, The 6 Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, etc.  Just like every other network out there they bury us with reality shows, lousy remakes of good television series, and pitiful comedy series.  Battlestar Galactica had the right actors/actresses.  It was just a darn good drama series.  Special effects were also good for the time.  Some of the special effects now are great, but tend to be too digital, and it can look cheesy.  SyFy Channel is real guilty of this.  I've seen a lot of their movies that were just lame, and a little too far fetched even for science fiction.  The old Battlestar Galactica shows what televisioin used to be, and will never be again.  It's nice to sit back, and go back again!!
0446567337|4.0|I really liked the book. Just no happily ever after for John. This is the first book I have read of Sparks, but I look forward to reading more. He shows the man's heart breaking.
1423117166|5.0|This is truly an art book, in the best sense of the word. Thumbing through it, I felt previledged to be able to be able to see all the great pieces that lead to all those movies that marked my childhood.  The images are very clear, in quality paper and I recommend this book to anyone, wether they are interested in animation or not bacause it truly is the type of book that can provide a magical experience to anyone that grew up watching the classic disney movies!
B001DPC52C|4.0|The Black Symphony concert is the most AMAZING concert that WT has ever done! The concert is a little over 2 hours longs with 21 songs, 20 of which are by WT (the first song is the Overture written by Jules Buckely, the conductor of the orchestra). The orchestra, lights, video effects, and of course the band make this concert a very memorable one! However, there is one thing I don't like about the US version...it doesn't have the second DVD and the second CD. The US only got 1DVD/1CD version of Black Symphony. The European version has 2DVD/2CD, which is what I have. I'm probably one of the biggest WT fanatics you'll meet so I was very mad about the US version! So I bought the European version from the band's official site. It was a lot more expensive (because of the Dollar/Euro thing) but it was worth EVERY penny! The second disc contains tour footage, videos, \\"making of videos\\", and an awesome bonus concert of the band's special performance in Eindhoven!! Not to mention, the 2 CDs have the ENTIRE concert while the 1 CD from this version just has like 13 songs out of the 21. I definitely recommend big fans of WT to buy the European version even if it is a bit expensive but if you're just getting in to WT or they're just one of those bands you like then go ahead and get this! :)
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I purchased this DVD to replace a friends that I had lost.

0307269760|5.0|First, I downloaded the Kindle version of \\"Too Much Happiness,\\" but now I'm ordering the hard copy of Alice Munro's delicious collection of short stories. I find myself wanting to go back, to re-read, to underline, to savor her insight and her craftsmanship. I need to have this book in my hands and in my collection -- and this is the first time in 18 months of e-reading that I've felt this way.    \\"Too Much Happiness\\" is truly a master work -- a beautiful juxtaposition of the unexpected against familiar everyday life. The irony of the title only adds another dimension to every story.
B000BSNPRG|5.0|Within Temptation never fails to put on a great show! This DVD is a great package for any fan! You get to see concerts from different countries/festivals including the big one performed in Java Island, Amsterdam. It also features a lot of backstage material, \\"making of\\", and a lot of interviews and fun stuff! Don't worry for those of you who don't speak Dutch like me, there are English subtitles for most everything! :)
B00000DFSK|5.0|Sent on a timely basis, and product arrived in the condition promised.  Would use them again.
B001FB55I0|4.0|The blueray picture is always better than the DVD and the extra's are nice as well. The movie plot was so-so, but I was entertained throughout and thats what counts.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|These days, \\"sci-fi\\" usually means one of two things:    1) Big budget CGI fests that are 99% special effects and 1% plot, or  2) Preachy over-the-top \\"Disaster\\" movies that are 99% fiction and 1% science.    In contrast, `Dark City' is a rare beast; a genuine, intelligent, thought-provoking science fiction film.     It's best to go into this movie without knowing anything about the plot, since unravelling the story is a key element of the film. For this reason, you should get the Director's Cut instead of the original (see below).  Suffice to say that 'Dark City' takes a fairly well-worn opening (amnesiac wakes up in a strange room with a dead body) and expands it into something completely unexpected.  We quickly realise that the murder mystery and John Murdoch's attempts to unravel his past are only a small part of a much larger story. This is a complex and intelligent film, and requires some concentration to follow. I must mention a scene early on that seems like a jarring continuity error at first....this forms a major part of the plot revelation later in the film.      The cast do an excellent job; Rufus Sewell nails the confused but driven hero Murdoch, and William Hurt gives an under-stated, sympathetic performance as Bumstead. Jennifer Connelly as Anna and Richard O'Brien as the sinister Mr Hand are also good in their roles. But the real star is Kiefer Sutherland, who gives what should have been an Oscar-winning performance as the creepy, enigmatic Dr Schreber.  Filmed in Sydney, Australians will notice plenty of local actors in cameo roles (Colin Friels, Melissa George, Bruce Spence, Nicholas Bell, David Wenham...).    The production and direction are top-class as well. There is some use of CGI, but it's not overdone, and certainly doesn't take the place of plot and character development. There is effective use of subtle shading and artificial lighting by director Alex Proyas, since most of the action takes place in the dark. And the deliberately anachronistic setting is both film-noir and futuristic at the same time. The skyline of the city brings to mind `Metropolis', but many of the sets were later re-used for `The Matrix'.      It's best to get the Director's Cut over the original release now that it's available. There are several small scenes which help flesh out the story a bit, particularly involving Bumstead, but the main difference is the removal of the opening narration. Obviously the studio heads under-estimated the intelligence of sci-fi audiences, and forced Proyas to add a narration containing several spoilers to the theatrical release. The Director's Cut removes this...but if you do get the original release, you can just turn the volume down until Dr Schreber first appears. Trust me, this is one film you will enjoy working out for yourself instead of having it spoon-fed to you.    Really, this film just clicks. What could have been a very self-indulgent storyline is made tight and entertaining because the casting, production, script and direction work so well. If you expect a brainless popcorn \\"sci-fi\\" blockbuster then don't bother, but for those of us who were crying out for a return to \\"real\\" science fiction, `Dark City' is a masterpiece.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I bought this series because I had not seen the first season in its entirety. I was so happy when I found it on sale. I bought it and it arrived that week. It is a great show and very entertaining.
B001S86J2Q|1.0|The video was fine but the audio was so terrible we could not even watch it. We had the volume turned all the way up and could barely hear the dialogue. Then when a song would come on the audio would boost back to normal and we would have to rush to turn the tv down. It got progressively worse throughout the movie. We have had similar experiences with other older movies that were put onto blu-ray but this was unwatchable. The seller did great, got the dvd promptly, much quicker than I expected, but the product was unacceptable.
1933771690|1.0|Robert Lanza is scientifically illiterate, or he is preying on those who don't know better to sell books.    Recently Lanza has taken up writing supporting articles for his own theory on the Huffington Post, where he deletes dissenting views, so I'm tending towards the latter.  It also doesn't help that he's teamed up with well known huckster of pseudoscience Deepak Chopra.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I absolutely love the show Castle! I have been watching it from the beginning and cannot wait until Mondays come and I get to enjoy an hour of comedy mixed with some mystery. It has my sense of humor, sarcastic and witty, and there is great chemistry between Stana and Nathan! I have now gotten 4 of my other friends hooked on the show! If you are looking for a new show that has everything and more to offer, definitely choose Castle!
B002NXSRX4|4.0|First.........ANYONE that knocks Transformers Part 1 or 2 is not a movie buff, nor a sci-fi fan with any taste.  Both those movies did as well as they did for a reason...............actually 500 million reasons..............because they were good.  So if you hear of someone dogging this movie (or any movie for that matter) and at the same time dogging either Transformers flicks then don't take their suggestions ever.  For those that don't like Transformers then go watch The Notebook or The English Patient or something and stop wasting your time writing meritless reviews.  This movie is highly entertaining and fun.  Certainly not an award winner but NEVER INTENDED TO BE.<br /><br />Man I wish people would quit bichin about \\"Hollywood putting out steaming piles\\" and all that jazz.  SHUT IT!!!!!
0066620996|5.0|There are not many great companies. Most companies that are great - earning profits far above those of comparable companies, year after year - were born that way. But very occasionally companies which are just ordinary or \\"good\\" transition into great companies. How would you go about finding the factors that helped a \\"good\\" company become a \\"great\\" one?<br /><br />That was essentially the question that Jim Collins asked. He started by identifying 11 companies that were just ordinary companies, but which at some point in their lives changed so that for a period of 15 years they provided cumulative returns to investors far greater than those of comparable companies.<br /><br />The factors identified by Jim Collins and his team as distinguishing the \\"good to great\\" companies from the rest were: disciplined people, disciplined thought, and disciplined action. \\"Disciplined people\\" includes having a particular style of leadership and a focus on getting the right people on the team. \\"Disciplined thought\\" includes confronting the brutal facts and carefully selecting your core business. \\"Disciplined Action\\" includes having a culture of discipline and the use of carefully selected technology accelerators.<br /><br />Good to Great is rightly regarded as a business classic. It is well researched and well written, and it contains a number of concepts and tools which are very helpful when appraising or creating the strategy of an organisation. Even if you do not agree with everything that Jim Collins says, you will benefit from at least considering the questions which he raises.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|For many years I had thought about purchasing individual Beatles CD's.  I'm glad I didn't because I got more music that I would have and paid less than purchacing CD's individually.  If you don't have a Bealtes music collection and wanted one, this is the box set to buy.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|Bullitt is a great movie and is (or WAS if there's been a more recent one that I don't know of) reputed to contain the best car chase scene ever. Like the chases on Rockford Files, but longer, and nice and wild. Being an old guy, it came to my attention that some of the young guys never even heard of Steve McQueen. I think they should experience the old greats among stars, such as McQueen, Cary Grant, Edward G. Robinson, and so many others, at least as a basis for comparison with the stars of today. Back then you didn't have to have all the bad language to make a movie sell. Just a good plot, and good acting.  I could say a lot more, but I hope this contains some new information for some, and also provides motivation to explore the fantastic quality of the better older movies and actors.
B002TUU4EG|5.0|I remember watching Julia, in black and white, on PBS. She was always cheery and very informative. She could teach you to make anything.    The movie definitely caught her spirit and told her story. The acting was superb.    Oh yes, and the shopping bag is very classy.

B0036B8MZU|5.0|Ok, so after reading through some of the reviews of Sparticus: Blood and Sand I felt obligated to express my opinion.  First things first, I am a male in my early twenties and enjoy period piece depiction series.  Let's coinsider the target audience this show is ment for.  My guess, in reference to the demograph, would be males age 18-35.  The lesbian-esque orgies, excessive violence, and male dominated roles all inclined to attract that target crowd.        The show is quite violent spilling literally \\"bucket of blood.\\"  It seems to me the director is leaning more towards a stylistic or artistic approach if you would to the violence in the show based on the success of other films such as 300 and Watchmen: Director's Cut.  I'd imagine the life of a gladiator in the arena was quite graphic so in that respect the brutality is authentic.    One of the complaints seems to be excessive use of CGI enviornments.  There is no argueing that point because some of the scenes ARE heavy on the CGI, but again the focus (and budget money) seems to be spent on achieving those briliant stylistic fight sequences.     It's too soon to tell how developmed each character will become AND how thick and windy the plot will be, but I can only hope for the best coinsidering all I have seen so far I love!      One quarrel I have with the show is the language.  Honestly, did the people really talk like that??? I think not! Then again maybe they did.  Point being it just sounds silly and out of place when the characters converse with such colorful words.     It's really hard to judge a show off of one or two episodes so please folks give it a chance!!! See the show for what it is and allow it to grow on you. Ask yourself what is the director's goal?  Just because you don't like it surely doesn't make it a bad show!  I find it quite entertaining, enthralling, and addictive.      A side note....I also pick up on a lot of homoerotic tension in this show.  Thoughts?
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|My daughter recommended this movie, so I bought it.  It was a lot of fun.  It is also my first Blu-ray disc.  The video quality is nice!  It also has the DVD for the older players in my house.
B001EL6EH2|5.0|The Blu-Ray quality of this DVD is incredible. You would think it was shot last week.
078513915X|5.0|I bought this for my 13 yr. old daughter and she loves it!  She said it is based more on the movie with Kierra Knightley than the book itself but was very enjoyable.  The pictures are great.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|I love this movie is Entertaining and funny. This Movie is for adult will not recommend for anyone under 17.
1582701709|3.0|I think The Secret is highly overrated. The book offers a very simplistic view of success, by saying that if you think positive thoughts, you are guaranteed to prosper. That kind of thinking may help people feel good about themselves and their future prospects, but good thoughts without action gets people nowhere.<br /><br />In order to prosper and accomplish one's goals, people must dream, formulate a plan that will enable them to fulfill their goals, and develop the strength to persevere despite any opposing forces that might be working against them. The Secret fails to discuss the latter two, which I feel makes it much less relevant than it portends to be.

B001O3ZU4I|5.0|I have a pretty diverse taste in music, though I generally tend to lean more towards progressive/metal types of music. Groups like Extreme generally don't interest me very often because their just isn't enough musical \\"meat\\" to chew on. That doesn't mean I can't appreciate some straight forward rock like AC-DC or ZZ Top from time to time, there's just not enough there to hold my interest for too long. Extreme's first album is pretty much in this vein and Extreme II while a step above their first wasn't something I found to be all that different than the rest of the music being produced by their peers.<br /><br />This album though is light years ahead of all that and stands out as one of the finest albums I've ever listened to. Every facet of this album is beautifully and painstakingly crafted and it the result is an inspired work of art. Everything from the 3 sides concept to the guitar work to the songs themselves is absolutely spot on. I still tear up during different, powerful moments in this album and that is very rare for me.<br /><br />I don't know how it might seem to an unitiated listener at this point but there is so much meat to this album that one can come back after many listens and catch a nuance you hadn't caught before. It's an absolutely incredible album for anyone who has a bit of a philosopher and romantic in him/her, this album gives one plenty to process and absorb. Those who are introspective will definitely enjoy even more though I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this album on many levels.<br /><br />I can't say it beats out albums like Close to the Edge (Yes), Abbey Road (Beatles, obviously) or Milliontown (Frost)...(actually, I dunno...it may be on par with Frost which is saying ALOT) it is certainly in the same league as all the masterpieces out there.

B000PKX2KA|5.0|This is a great piece of equipment!    I used to use my Garmin Etrex to provide GPS info to my laptop but it required a tangle of cable for power from the cigarette lighter and data to the computer, plus a serial to USB adapter (since the Garmin only outputs to a serial port and my new laptop doesn't have one - only USB). The setup was a mess in the car and it crashed Streets and Trips regularly.    The BU-353 doesn't have a display like the Garmin so it can't work on its own - but it is fabulous at what it does do: provide GPS position information to the laptop. It takes its power from the USB port and so only has one cable - for both power and data. It outputs in USB format so there is no serial to USB converter. It's clean, it's compact, it's easy to use and it works very, very well.    And it's incredibly sensitive. I put it as far forward on my dash as I could so it could get maximum exposure to the sky through it windshield and it worked great. Then once I forgot to put it up and left it on the passenger seat - upside down and under the laptop. And once again it worked beautifully.    And it's waterproof so I can use it on the boat.    As I said, a great piece of equipment.

B0002IRY0O|4.0|I started down this path with the original semi-bootleg of Bruckner's 3rd symphony that came out on Etcetera (Italian).  I was always impressed by this performance, it seemed to have perfectly judged tempi and seemed therefore to open up the symphony to new insights.  I recently got this boxed set which collects all the former bootleg live performances together, and with improved sound (at least based on my comparisons of the 3rd symphony).  I haven't finished listening to all the symphonies in this box set yet.  What I can say at this point is that it still seems to me that the tempi continue to be perfectly judged in these performances.  What is lacking, however, is the quality of playing.  I really wish Celibidache was conducting the Berlin Philharmonic here, or the Vienna Phil.  The dynamics and technical qualities are, quite frankly, mediocre.  The bottom line is I only recommend this for the Bruckner enthusiast/completist.  The audience applause present at the end of the original bootleg CDs has been unobtrusively removed here. You still get Celi's shouts which aren't at all intrusive to my ears.  The orchestra sure could use some encouragement anyway but it seems to fall on deaf ears, no real dynamism is attempted.  Maybe things will pick up as I work my way through this box set but the overall effect is more Classical era than Romantic.<br /><br />For a newbie, it is best just to stick to Karajan's recordings.  I know a lot of people aren't kind to Karajan's Bruckner but I've always found it to be reliably good.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Screenwriter-director Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) is a somewhat disturbing person, as are his films, which tend toward what I would call \\"black drama\\" - in the same way that the films of the Coen brothers tend toward black comedy. But Tarantino's films are incredibly interesting both visually and for their stories, which, like the Coens' films, are filled with some very interesting characters. In this case, the Inglourious Basterds is a group of fictional American soldiers, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), that is terrorizing the Nazis in France during WWII by brutally killing and scalping them Indian style. (This is not a film for weak stomachs.) If the group does let one go, they carve a swastika in his forehead so everyone will know, after the war, what he was.<br /><br />Inglourious Basterds is so well done, and so interesting, that I think it's permissible to overlook Tarantino's excesses for the moment in order to appreciate his craftsmanship. Young directors could learn much from him about how to create riveting scenes, characters and even set pieces. Tarantino likes to create vignettes, which means that each scene can stand on its own, even though, together, they tell a compelling story. His vision seems to come from comic books and graphic novels rather than reality. The art direction and photography are so graphic and so saturated with color that they add to the intensity of the action.<br /><br />Some of the more vulnerable characters are memorable - like Perrier LaPadite, a French dairy farmer, played by Denis Menochet, who pretty much steals one of the early scenes with his understated but poignant performance. The German Colonel Hans Landa - known as \\"the Hunter\\" because of his ability to track down Jews, and portrayed superbly by Christoph Waltz - fenagles LaPadite into disclosing that a family of Jews is hiding beneath his house. Or Shosanna, the only member of that family that escapes annihilation by Waltz's men. She flees to Paris and becomes the owner of a cinema that figures prominently in the story. She is played wonderfully by Melanie Laurent.<br /><br />Daniel Bruhl is effective as Fredrick Zoller, a German officer that becomes infatuated with Shosanna. Besides Colonel Hans Landa, most of the Nazis are little more than caricatures, except for Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress-turned-spy, played by Diane Kruger, who dominates the best scene in the film - a meeting in a rathskeller that turns into a Mexican standoff and will have you on the edge of your seat. As a matter of fact, most of the movie will. Except for the overly graphic violence and the brutality of certain scenes, Inglourious Basterds is a glorious suspense thriller that even Alfred Hitchcock would admire.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|If you've heard the story about the guy who tied helium balloons to his lawn chair and then took to the skies, multiply the balloons by about a zillion, tie them to a two-story house and launch, and you have the seminal idea behind UP.<br /><br />It all begins very much like It's A Wonderful Life. Young Carl Fredricksen and friend Ellie have a shared passion: adventure. Specifically, they both idolize adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who travels the world in his gigantic airship, the Spirit of Adventure. But when Muntz can't prove that a unique skeleton he brought back from South America's Paradise Falls isn't a fake, he is publicly disgraced. Vowing to go back and find the proof to clear his name, he boards his airship in anger and disappears into the clouds.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ellie tells Carl that she wants a house on top of Paradise Falls, and Carl innocently crosses his heart in promise to give it to her. When they grow up, Carl and Ellie marry, and, as in It's A Wonderful Life, they move into the rickety old house they once played in. They fix it up and live there for many happy years until Ellie passes away. Carl ends up as a crotchety old widower with an enormous building project going up all around him - and they want him out. So, remembering his promise to Ellie, and to escape his gloomy fate, he ties a zillion helium balloons to his house and takes off for South America and Paradise Falls.<br /><br />This is an adventure par excellence, very European in feel, with the charm of Ratatouille. But it is an odd assortment of characters. Besides Carl, who looks very much like Spencer Tracy and is played by Ed Asner (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), there's a stowaway: boy Wilderness Explorer, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who's working on his Helping Old People merit badge; a canine named Dug (Bob Peterson) that they meet in South America, and who has an electronic collar that allows him to talk; and Kevin... There are a pack of dogs, all with talking collars, but three main ones besides Dug: Alpha (again, Bob Peterson), Beta (Delroy Lindo) and Gamma (Jerome Ranft). Alpha has trouble with his collar, so that it produces a very high-pitched voice, which for an alpha dog is very embarrassing.<br /><br />Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc., story for WALL-E et al) and Bob Peterson (screenplay for Finding Nemo, story artist for Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life) co-directed this tale from a script by Peterson. It's a very sweet and funny story, full of poignant reminders that, while we need to seek adventures in life, the most important adventures are the ones we go on in our daily lives: such as marriage and parenting. The importance of fatherhood resonates in the relationship between Carl and Russell. Then there's Kevin...<br /><br />I think the biggest laugh comes when Russell's face is slammed against the window of Muntz's airship, and then is dragged across it making a streaking sound, while Muntz's eyes follow it inside. Of course, Russell is funny in general, being so naive. Then there are the dogs, who refer to Russell as \\"the small mailman\\" because of his Explorer uniform. Just about every dogism is used, from their love of balls and hatred of squirrels, to the dreaded \\"cone of shame.\\" Dug is especially enjoyable because he is the quintessential dog every kid loves.<br /><br />Visually, the film is stylized in a very lovable way, similar to a children's book. My favorite part are the balloons - they're terrific. This type of imagination and adventure builds strong values in kids. Contrast it with the previews that precede the movie of Disney fare that do little more than teach kids to live in out-of-touch dream worlds. It's hard to understand how Pixar and Disney joined forces. Disney doesn't seem to have a clue, and Pixar has every clue. I thank God for Pixar. They are just about the only bastion of good-quality, family-oriented movie-making left. Walen Media, who is so into books,  should borrow a page from Pixar's. MayPixar's tribe increase.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith
B0015AARJI|5.0|I feel like Sony upgraded the battery, because I have yet to see the low-battery indicator when playing.  I occasionally charge it when not in use or watching a movie.    It feels great in my hands, ie. heavier than non-dualshock controller, as well as smoother surface.  Maybe it's in my head, but it definitely has a better overall feeling.    Dualshock works great, though I hardly notice it since I play fast paced action games where I focus more on visual stimulation.    I do think these are very overpriced however. Sony is banking on the markup.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Sandra Bullock was a hot commodity in 2009. This is a very attractive comedy, with locations in New York and Alaska; a terrific cast in Ryan Reynolds (Wolverine, Definitely Maybe, Van Wilder), Mary Steenburgen (Four Christmases, Back To The Future Part III), Craig T. Nelson (The Incredibles, Coach), and Betty White (The Golden Girls, The Mary Tyler Moore Show); and a pretty good script. A couple that starts out hating each other and ends up loving each other is a good formula, as some of the most famous comedies - like The Philadelphia Story - and even dramas - such as Gone With The Wind - prove. In this case, Bullock is Reynold's slave-driver publishing boss, whom everyone fears and loathes, but Reynolds especially. When it looks like Bullock is going to be deported back to Canada because of an immigration problem, she blackmails Reynolds into marrying her, in spite of their age difference. Things really heat up when he takes her home to Alaska to meet his family, with an immigration official hot on their trail.<br /><br />I'll never understand why comedy writers and directors always include at least one tasteless scene in their films. In this case, it's the performance by local male stripper Ramone, played by Oscar Nunez. It's as if they want to make sure we realize that they don't respect us, so they give us a scene that you would have to be trailer trash to appreciate. Then there's the obligatory skin scene, which in this case involves the totally unbelievable coincidence of both Bullock and Reynolds being naked, slamming into each other, and ending up on the floor together. Of course, they still hate each other at this point, so they're not supposed to like it. And finally, as a tribute to bad TV, we have a bizarre scene with Betty White in the middle of the woods dressed in Indian garb, chanting to Mother Nature, with Sandra Bullock contributing to the ceremony by singing and dancing to the dirty lyrics of a rap song. In spite of these idiotic inclusions, this is a very likable film, primarily because, what's not to like about Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.

It not only was a good read many moons ago, but still today can capture keep the attention of young readers. The storyline and characters are all very believable and followable.

In it you watch a young boy grow into a young man who has to learn about trust, integrity, adventure, duties, and survival. You learn to love and hate Long John Silver, and feel compassion for the doctor and captain and squire. The ease at which the writer uses the pirate's language is amazing and I felt very well versed in it by the end of the book. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!!!
B002VECM6S|5.0|If you don't see any other film from 2009, you have to see this one. Not only is it good drama and even inspiring, Sandra Bullock (The Proposal, Crash, Miss Congeniality) is to die for. She plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a real-life, very high-mainteance, incredibly focused, tenacious wife, mother and interior designer, living a very wealthy lifestyle with her family in Memphis, Tennessee. One fateful rainy night, the family meets and decides to help a young, homeless black student from their children's private Christian school. He is Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), future All-American and first round NFL draft pick; but at the time, an introverted, poor student with only two qualities that might possibly help him to become a football player: his size and his protective instincts. Leigh Anne, with the help of husband Sean (Tim McGraw), son S.J. (Jae Head) and daughter Collins (Lily Collins), along with coach Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon), help Michael to see his potential and use it to become, not only a talented football player, but a good student and an honorable man. So that, by the end of the film, he has coaches from all over the South vying for his recruitment.<br /><br />This is a true story, based on the book by Michael Lewis (The Blind Side: Evolution Of A Game), and directed by John Lee Hancock (The Alamo, Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil, A Perfect World), who also co-wrote the screenplay with Lewis. Country music recording artist Tim McGraw is enjoyable as good-natured husband Sean, and also does the soundtrack. But Sandra Bullock steals the film. I know how good she is because I grew up in a Southern family with interior designers, and they're all high-maintenance, focused and tenacious like that. What makes Bullock's character extraordinary is the courage, heart and vision she adds to those qualities. But she never smiles... until the end of the film, and it's a classic moment. Another terrific scene is when the coaches from different universities are looking at a video of Oher blocking an opposing player that has been antagonizing him all game, and pushing him all the way down the field, into the end zone and over the fence. That's just one of the many times you'll laugh and cry simultaneously. This movie makes me glad there is still a movie industry.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Ever since Gene Roddenberry came up with the original Star Trek television show, there have been fans of the captain and crew of the Starship Enterprise, and they seem to multiply with every new film based on the series. This latest is obviously the start of a whole new series (hence the subtitle), that goes all the way back to when the crew first formed. Fans of the TV show will love comparing these new, young Enterprise crew members with their originals. There are enough of the hallmark idiosyncrasies sprinkled throughout to give even a casual fan delight.<br /><br />My favorite character, though, is not one of the crew members of the Enterprise, but Eric Bana as the Romulan leader, Nero. His has the advantage of being a new character, which he uses very well. The crew members, on the other hand, have the burden of filling the shoes of those very famous predecessors, which is not easy. The one that does it most successfully, I think, is Karl Urban as Dr. \\"Bones\\" McCoy. The others have issues that are partly their fault, but also partly that of the writers and director.<br /><br />It starts out gangbusters with the birth of James T. Kirk, and the almost simultaneous death of his father, a starship commander who gives his life to save his crew, wife and child. This scene shows us where the younger Kirk gets his maverick leadership style, as well as sets the stage for a Romulan attack when James T. is grown. From there, we alternate between the development Kirk and that of Spock.<br /><br />As a Vulcan youth, Spock is being teased and insulted by his fellows for his earthly mother, and loses his temper in a very un-Spock-like fashion. The adolescent Kirt is being chased down by a cop for racing his step father's vintage Mustang convertible, and almost loses his life in the process. Later we see Spock as a young man, played by Zachary Quinto, giving up the Vulcan Science Academy for a career in Starfleet - also because of an emotional provocation. Kirk as a young man, played by Chris Pine, takes on some starship crewmen in a bar when he tries to pick up Lt. Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and as a result is recruited into Starfleet by an old family friend, Captain Christopher Pike, played by Bruce Greenwood. Greenwood is, in my opinion, one of the better casting decisions, and gives one of the best performances in the film. He actually seems like a starship commander, whereas Pine never quite makes the transition - nor does Quinto as Spock, for that matter.<br /><br />How Spock and Kirk end up on the Enterprise is vague and questionable, to say the least. Nothing in the film seems to follow military protocol, whereas in the original television series, they do. As a matter of fact, writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman seem to be totally ignorant of military protocol, so that by the time all the original characters are on the bridge, you're wondering when the grown-ups are going to show up and establish some order. But I have to say that, while this is probably the weakest aspect of the film, it is not very consequential in this first installment. It may be later, so I hope they gain some discipline by the next one.<br /><br />The best part of Star Trek are the introductions of the main characters. Old fans will love it. Dr. Bones McCoy (Karl Urban) is the most enjoyable of the crew, in my opinion, and turns out to be the best character and actor throughout. He almost steals the show with his caustic but good natured personality. Chekov (Anton Yelchin), who delightfully butchers all references to the Vulcans with his thick Russian accent, and Scotty, who amazes even himself with his engineering feats, are both fun. But the heavy, if there is one, is Eric Bana as Nero, the Romulan leader. As with almost every other role he's played, Bana is terrific. His makeup is also terrific, but I hate to think how long he had to sit in the makeup chair to get that on.<br /><br />As far as action, it's non-stop. The best scene is when Kirk, Sulu (John Cho - my least favorite of the main characters) and another officer skydive from space and try to land on a gigantic Romulan drilling rig that is boring a hole into the core of Vulcan in order to destroy it. The photography, special effects and stunts are phenomenal. My other favorite scene is the final showdown on the Romulan vessel.<br /><br />This truly is a great kickoff to a strong future series. But there are a few problems I think the producers will need to iron out if it is to be the best it can be. I mentioned the military protocol issue. There's also the issue of James T. Kirk. While I think Chris Pine certainly has the chutzpah for Kirk, he lacks the finesse and polish. He's too rough around the edges, and I don't see that disappearing with maturity. I know that finesse and polish are part and parcel of William Shatner, but Shatner defined the role, as did Nemoy the role of Spock, and that has to be respected.<br /><br />Which brings me to Spock: a love affair with Lt. Uhura? I don't think so. There is no precedent, that I am aware of, for that. It is, as Spock would say, highly illogical and most improbable. Which may be why the filmmakers went there, but it leaves no where for the Spock character to go in future episodes. If you plum his humanity in the first film, that's it for him. You have to leave some kind of mystery to Spock, who is, and should be, the most mysterious of all the characters.<br /><br />Star Trek is great entertainment. I'm presently reading Starman Jones by Robert A. Heinlein, and can see in it where both Star Trek and Star Wars got their inspiration. Heinlein defined the space genre, which is strange considering how few of his novels have been made into motion pictures. The only ones I am aware of are Red Planet and Starship Troopers. I'm surprised Starman Jones and Stranger In A Strange Land haven't hit the big screen, as they are both naturals.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|The new Sherlock Holmes, starring Robert Downey, Jr. as the great detective, and Jude Law as his sidekick, Dr. Watson, is enjoyable, but hardly the characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The fact that there were five (count them - five!) writers on this film may explain part of the problem. Then there's director Guy Richie, who's typical film is the likes of RocknRolla. Rather than Sir Arthur's stories, which are very much grounded in pre-Edwardian thinking and culture, what we're given is a cross between Sherlock Holmes and The Wild, Wild West. And instead of the cerebral, hunter-clad mystery-solver, we're offered a slovenly rake that engages in fisticuffs as often as James West. I wonder at what the filmmakers were thinking.<br /><br />While Downey is interesting, certainly, he is no Holmes. (Or, perhaps I should say, no Basil Rathbone.) Law as Dr. Watson, on the other hand, is quite convincing and the greatest asset to the film. He would almost have made a better Homes. I think this is an example of miscast actors, as well as miscast vision. Other disappointments include the plot, which is completely far-fetched and dark, as the antagonists involve themselves in world domination through Satanism (!!!). And the flashback technique used to make sure we notice all the clues Holmes uncovers is clever once, but becomes redundant with overuse. The weakest part of the film is the ending: a fight between Holmes and Lord Blackwood, played by Mark Strong, on a broken down bridge that is so obviously CGI that the whole scene seems fake - not good for a climax.<br /><br />Some of the better aspects of the film are that it is fun, and highly entertaining. I mean, how can a film about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson not be entertaining if it's done halfway right? There's just something about a detective sleuthing around the fog-laden streets of London. And Robert Downey, Jr. does bring a lot to the table - it's just not a lot of Sherlock Holmes. Then there's the attractive third protagonist, Rachel McAdams, who adds to the Wild, Wild West feel. In spite of its weaknesses, Sherlock Holmes is enjoyable; but the series starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce is still the best.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I don't know all the details, but at some point, James Cameron (Titanic, Aliens, Terminator) and Pixar were both considering doing a film based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter of Mars, a series of science fiction novels that followed his Tarzan series. For whatever reason, Cameron decided instead to do an anti-capitalist, New Age picture that is vaguely inspired by the novels; while Pixar opted to do a faithful adaptation of the series, the first of which is due to come out in 2012. One reason the series has not been attempted before is because the technology hasn't been available to create the weird creatures that populate Burroughs' version of Mars, which he calls Barsoom. Both Cameron's film Avatar, and the upcoming Pixar film, utilize a seamless combination of digital animation and live action, as well as state-of-the-art 3D technology.<br /><br />Avatar is a visual and cinematic masterpiece, with eye-popping scenery and special effects. The story, on the other hand, is a bit worn. One younger viewer compared it to Pocahontas - the big, bad white conquistadors invading the innocent natives' pristine jungle. That may make for a politically correct tale in an age gone mad over \\"green,\\" but it doesn't add up if you think about it too much. Nevertheless, Avatar is a very entertaining film, and one that breaks ground for future innovations.<br /><br />While art direction and special effects are the obvious stars, Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation), turns in a strong performance as Jake Sully, a paraplegic Marine that scientists can transform, virtually, into a creature called an avatar, so that he resembles and can interact with the beings that populate the moon Pandora, where the story takes place. Also good is Zoe Saldana (Star Trek, Vantage Point) as Neytiri, a native with whom Sully falls in love. Sigourney Weaver also stars as Dr. Grace Augustine, one of the scientists testing the new avatar technology.<br /><br />What I think Cameron did was to merge the stories of Tarzan and John Carter of Mars, and then give them a New Age, politically correct twist to cash in on the global warming frenzy. But Burroughs was anything but New Age and political. His novels are right at the center of the pulp fiction, action-adventure genre - full of violence and love-making - that early 20th Century American males ate up - which is the antithesis of what Cameron has come up with. Nevertheless, I like most aspects of Cameron's vision and how he has used the technology. The film has a wonder to it that one does not easily forget.

0439023483|5.0|Loved this book!  Exciting, fast paced, romance and a story and plot you can really melt into.  Did I forget to mention original?  A society based off of the US but with districts.  A lottery win for the lucky girl and boy then you get to fight for your life and this is an honor.? Winning means more than your life, it means a better life but at the expense of others.  Not all agree with the Capital and rebel against the taking of life for the pure pleasure of the Capital and there lessons.  You won't be able to put this book down.
B00275EGWY|3.0|The Hurt Locker is an almost docudrama about a bomb squad in Iraq; but specifically one soldier named SFC William James (Jeremy Renner), and his delusional take on life and his job. Slanted, anti-war and almost anti-military, I felt this film by director Kathryn Bigelow was almost an insult to our men and women in uniform. It is fascinating for the first hour as you watch these men do their very dangerous work in a very hostile environment; but then it becomes tedious and almost boring as they get drunk and beat the hell out of each other on their time off. Rated R for violence and language.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith

B002RSDW80|4.0|I've never seen a movie about food I didn't like: Ratatoulli, Babette's Feast, Chocolat. Watching people who know what they're doing prepare food is entertaining - thus the popularity of the Food Network. But before there was a Food Network, there was Julia Child, who taught America to cook through her book, Mastering The Art Of French Cooking, her cooking school, and her very popular TV show. Julie And Julia is a double tale about how Julia Child got started cooking, which is humorous in itself; but also about a young woman named Julie that wanted to be like her. So Julie decides to cook all the recipes in Julia's cookbook over the course of a year, and to blog about her experiences on the Internet. This may sound tame, but it is quite an experience, and almost costs Julie her marriage and even her sanity.<br /><br />The film is based on two real life stories - Julia Child's autobiography, My Life In France; and Julie And Julia by Julie Powell - about two real life couples. Meryl Streep is a hoot as Julia Child, with Stanley Tucci playing her understanding husband, Paul; and Amy Adams is good as aspiring cook and writer Julie Powell, with Chris Messina playing her patient husband, Eric. The film jumps back and forth between Julia's life in France as the wife of a diplomat (?), and Julie's life in New York as a government worker. The scenes in France are fascinating. The New York story is funny and fun and lends a human element to a story that might otherwise seem artificial. What's amazing is how cooking leads to so many romantic moments! It's good fun. PG-13<br /><br />Waitsel Smith

B0008ENHTE|5.0|1968 crime thriller about maintaining integrity in the face of pressure to compromise. Steve McQueen plays Detective Frank Bullitt, an honest but not always by-the-book cop that's given the assignment to protect a state's witness. A local politician (Robert Vaughn) is counting on this witness to earn national recognition for his breaking up a crime syndicate. When something happens to the witness, the politician tries to cover it up and to crucify Bullitt. But Bullitt is given 24 hours by his boss (Don Gordon) to find the killers.<br /><br />This very gritty action film - based on real-life detective Dave Toschi (Zodiac Killings) and Robert L. Pike's novel, Mute Witness - was ground-breaking in its day, and is noted for having the most famous car chase of all time. Taking place in the streets of San Francisco and involving a souped up Mustang and a Dodge Charger, it is still considered the standard. No CGI here - these are real drivers doing real stunts. McQueen, who was a race car driver himself, wanted to do his own stunts; but because of the dangers involved, the filmmakers said no. He's still behind the wheel quite a bit.<br /><br />Jacqueline Bisset plays Bullitt's girlfriend. You'll hear some terrific 60s music when they go out on the town. Robert Duvall plays a cab driver in one of his first scenes ever. Bullitt won the Oscar for Best Film Editing and was nominated for Best Sound. It also won other prestigious awards for its cinematography and script, as well as for its editing and sound. McQueen considered this his best performance, and his favorite of all his films. You won't want to miss it. Rated PG, but still very edgy.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith
B000B8QF14|5.0|If you've never seen Green Day live this is probably the next best thing, a video record of one of their grandest shows. They're at one of their peaks, as American Idiot had become a sensation, and playing in England - the breeding ground of the original punk movement - in front of a huge, die-hard crowd. It doesn't get much better than this. There are little interview snippets and backstage scenes interspersed between some songs, so be ready for that. But all in all really a blast of the good stuff.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie.  Good cast and great music. Check it out, you shan't be disappointed.
B00063F8B2|5.0|Perfect \\"sing-a-long\\" CD especially if you've seen the movie or read the book. The Polar Express has been and continues to be my great-grandson's favorite book and DVD. He loves to hear the CD as we're driving regardless of what time of year it is. At 5 he has memorized the whole soundtrack. His only comment is that the songs are not in the order they were played in the DVD and recognized that right away.

My wife has made two dinners and a chocolate cake, taken from this book and it has been some of the best food I have ever had.

B0024F08RO|2.0|Season 4 of Prison Break... Let's talk about it.<br /><br />So, they're out of both Prisons now and working together tying to beat the clock with Homeland Security offering their freedom for their help recovering files from The Company. Mahone, Scholfield. Lincoln, Sucre, Bellick, Sara and a new techy try to work together and try to push aside their personal grievances to try and take down the Company while some of the people are trying to find a way out of their current situation. While Theodore (T-Bag) chases down the clues in the \\"Bird-Watching\\" Book.<br /><br />Realistically, this season is a joke. The twists and turns are cheesy and corny at best. The dark and ominous music played with what is supposed to be an intense situation is laughable. Agent Self played by Michael Rapaport is an absolute terrible casting call for that character. They could have chosen someone better to play that part. More simply said, a few street cons and a couple law enforcement agents could not do what they're trying to accomplish in this Season.<br /><br />It seems to me that the writers for this season got lazy. They were told when the season started that it would be their last season and allowed them to finish it out. The finishing season is honestly, atrocious. Plain and simple.<br /><br />I purchased this season after I watched the first 3 seasons on a Shared Company Server and after the first three episodes I immediately regretting wasting the $30 and should have cut my losses. Unless you're a real big Prison Break fan and absolutely HAVE to know what happens after season 3 then just beware before you buy: It's just not the same. Not even close.
B001TH16DS|3.0|I've been a fan of Star Trek, the Original Series since the show first aired. For my money, there's no better Starship captain than James T. Kirk. Sure, they were hokey episodes. I always laugh when someone, usually Scotty, would grab what appeared to be a wrench when he crawls under a supposedly futuristic, ultra-high tech instrument panel to fix something gone awry. And don't even get me started about the incredibly low-tech monsters and special effects that graced the show.    Still, when I think of Star Trek, I think of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and the rest of the Original Series gang. It didn't matter to me that things looked hokey. That added to the show's charm.    With the advent of Blu-ray, I couldn't wait to see my favorite sci-fi series married to the most advanced viewing medium yet invented.    Imagine my disappointment when the first season of Star Trek arrived and I saw a better picture, yes, but also an icon in the upper right of my TV screen that told me I could watch the low-tech special effects if I clicked the \\"Angle\\" button on my Blu-ray players remote. After spending two hours searching the Internet, reading posts, perusing reviews, and discovering -- much to my dismay -- that the icon can't be turned off! There it is, in every episode, distracting the hell out of me, taunting me from its perch. What Einstein designed that?    On top of that, the enhanced special effects look *more* hokey than what the series originally offered. They look cheesy, as if they're from a 90s computer game. The Enterprise looks absolutely plastic and, worse, lifeless. Some of the sets also appear to be newly built, digitally. I'm not 100% sure about that. But they sure do look odd compared to everything else, like they exist as CGI. So they, too, look \\"fake\\" (as if I was ever fooled into thinking sets on the original series were \\"real\\").     To make matters worse, the sound is dodgy. On some episodes, I have to turn up the volume extremely high to hear what's going on. Then, when the show ends and it returns to the main menu, the sound blasts me out of my seat. To get better sound, I have to flip the switch to \\"Mono\\" so that the sound is more focused and balanced in the center-channel speaker. So I can't even use the setting the BD player automatically chooses based on the type of signal it's getting from the discs themselves. What's up with that?    Is it my equipment? I don't think so. I have a brand-new Philips 42\\" TV with 50,000:1 dynamic contrast. Even 70-year-old movies like Gone With the Wind are so crisp it's like watching real people out of a window. My receiver is brand-new as well. It's an Onkyo that makes everything sound terrific. The speakers? They're B&Ws, wonderful speakers. The Blu-ray player is also a brand-new item, a Philips.    So, with all of that equipment, most of it brand new, I should be able to enjoy Star Trek: Original Series, Season One with no problem. But I can't. Between the sound -- that fluctuates between horrible and so-so -- and that darn \\"Angle\\" icon that I can't make go away, I'm irritated beyond belief. (For the record, I own a few dozen Blu-ray discs, the images on which range from 1939 to 2010. I don't have these problems on any other Blu-ray.)    The picture, although much improved (and, boy, does Spock's make-up look strange with such on-screen clarity!), does not offset the rest of the problem I've encountered.    I've watched a half dozen episodes so far. I'm not sure I'm enjoying this experience enough to buy Season Two and Season Three, as much as I love those original episodes.     My advice to anyone considering this set is to think long and hard about it. The two main reasons to buy Blu-ray are (1) picture enhancement, and (2) sound enhancement. Star Trek: Original Series Blu-ray blows it with both. So what's to gain by buying the Blu-rays? I'm not sure yet.    So the choice is yours. Remember: Caveat emptor.

B0036EH3WU|5.0|God bless Amazon for fast-tracking shipments of LOST's final season before it's even finished airing on TV!  We watched all the episodes over 2 days and let me tell you....the twists and turns that pepper this final season will BLOW YOU AWAY!    HERE BE SPOILERS!  Who would have thought alternate-reality Jack's explicit gay encounter with alternate-reality Hurley (06x12 - Everybody Loves Hugo) could even be screened on network TV?  Unless the DVD version is unrated?    The final ending twist, being that the whole story from the beginning was just a dream of Vincent's (Walt's dog), a-la Pam from Dallas, was genius. In reality, the survivors are only on the beach for another 2 hours before a passing cargo ship spots them and they are rescued!    But the whole 'backwards talking' episode (06x09 - Ab Aeterno) just fell flat in my opinion.  HELLO?  Twin Peaks anyone?  And they had the good sense to do it for only one scene.....not the whole episode!    Other small touches, like the death of Jack halfway through the season, the musical episode, the Smoke Monster/Locke reveal, and the copious amounts of explicit sex, especially involving Hurley and Claire, really made the final season the most memorable.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B001GCUO4S|2.0|I love Final Destination (2000). It's scary, even if it doesn't take itself seriously - much like Scream, back in '96. One of the things that came out as distinctive, or 'original', about it was the fact that death itself was chasing these characters who were meant to die but escaped.<br /><br />Now, ten years and 3 movies later, plotwise, there's absolutely nothing original about these movies. They've basically remade the original movie 3 times, and people keep coming to the theatres mainly to see how different the deaths are.<br /><br />Even the death scenes have gotten increasingly worse since FD2. FD2 was, yes, a \\"remake\\", but a worthy sequel nonetheless. The opening was absolutely fantastic, scary, crazy stuff. Made me terrified to go home by car. The deaths were a bit cartoonish but not cartoonish enough to make me laugh (FD3, FD4.)<br /><br />These movies are not (supposed to be) comedies. I guess that's the problem. There was a ominous, malevolent presence in FD and FD2 that I just wasn't able to see in FD3 and 4.<br /><br />I wish they came up with a ORIGINAL Final destination movie. Enough with the premonitions. stop making us roll our eyes. make it scary. bloody does not mean scary. make a good movie. remind me why i am/was a fan.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|Not to be confused with the 1983, American made \\"A Christmas Story\\", This Finnish made \\"Christmas Story\\" movie is a treasure for young and old alike. It's carefully interwoven to encompass all the most important elements of the real life of Saint Nicholas, growing up as a boy into adulthood. Then ingeniously ties in all the popular legends and lore that he inspired and leaves the viewer with explanations for the all the modern customs we continue to carry on in his name.<br />  A visually beautiful, and well made film that will leave you with a heavy heart and a tear in your eye, but feeling invigorated. Made in Finland and released to Region 1 without the ability to watch the film with subtitles instead of dubbing, but nonetheless even the voice actors in the Region 1 version do the film proud. A non-religious, Christmas classic to be sure. As an extra treat there is a \\"Making of\\" featurette that is in Finnish with subtitles, so at least we can get a glimpse of the amazingly talented people who put this film together, and hear the actors without the dubbing.<br />  If you're a Christmas historian or Santa Claus aficionado, this is a must see film. A real treat on all levels.

1573229725|5.0|I need to tell you a story, more like a description than anything else, that should help you to understand my views on this book. I'm not familiar with every idiom of English language, so when I stumbled upon this title, I didn't know what to think of it. Didn't know it's meaning and usage and so on. But, what matters more is this. In my language, title of this books is translated like \\"Cheaters\\", with blurb saying it's all about lesbian love in Victorian age. If we add to that trashy cover art with two girls in long white dresses, you can imagine what my expectations were. I expected nothing more than average piece of historical fiction, uninventive, industrial piece on impossibilities of love between same sexes, one of those numerous books that you forget the moment after you finish  them. Reading of five hundred pages just to confirm that suspicion seemed like too much, and I was on the verge of never opening this one. If I have done that, I would have missed a lot. Now, I don't know what English edition blurbs look like, but I recommend that you don't read them. Not because of possible trash value of some of them, but because they spoil the books (at least mine did) on more profound level. What am talking about? This book is all about secrets, story-twists, misleading chapters, misunderstanding and unknown that reading about single aspect in the blurb will eventually spoil everything. Now, my thoughts on this book were challenged first time on the end of the first part, where I was totally astounded and surprised (something that didn't happen to me in a long, long time) and I found myself wanting more, racing through the pages just to reach conclusion. By the end, I was somewhat disappointed because Sarah Waters lost her initial punch and kinda drifted away, but in the end I felt strangely satisfied by what I just read that all of my resentments disappeared. And I was left with musing about how very good this book actually is.<br /><br /> Now, I will not talk about plot or narration here, considering that knowing all of that will just spoil your reading. What I want to say is this - this in not a historical fiction Sure, it happens in 19th century London and its surroundings and there are no cars or television around but what has been narrated can easily be translated into some of the countries of today without loosing anything in the process. This is the book about lives of the underdogs, book about madness of mental institutions (for those of you who have missed Foucault speaking about the same thing on much more complex level), book about faulty expectations and double standards, about hypocrisy and love and, in a certain way, it becomes postmodern deconstruction of historical fiction as such. But this, purely narrational ploy with its consequences and private hints doesn't suffocate the book. It breathes with life, drawing it's reader inside the text, never letting go.<br /><br />I don't have a single idea about the other works of Sarah Waters, but I will certainly look her up now. Maybe I was missing much all these years, maybe not. But, beauty lies in the process of discovery. I advise that you do the same.out plot or narration here, considering that knowing all of that will just spoil your reading.

1906694176|5.0|The third, and sadly, last installment on the incredibly interesting Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist story.  Steig Larsson's continuing story reaches a truly twisted and fascinating culmination.  We get a much expanded view into Lisbeth's world, and we get to watch Kalle Blomkvist create havoc with the Swedish Secret police. Such  a great story. Hope someone makes a film of it.

However, she does give a solid CD with some surprisingly great vocals on some tracks such as 'the way i loved you' & 'i got u'. Overall, if your not too critical of music, this is for you. However, don't buy it if your just going to complain - Acting is her first passion, Singing is a hobby. (:

I got excited when I saw the title and thought it might be the HALO movie that had gone straight to DVD, but I thought that had halted in the process of filming... Oh well, won't waste my $$ on HALO Legends, that's for sure!

B001W79MB8|4.0|Let me start off by stating that this movie dialogue speaks in both Chinese and Japanese.You only hear this when they are fighting one another.English when dialog takes place among when they are talking among their own people.I thought that was hot personally but some might just opt for subtitles. The sounds and fight sequence are truly top notch and you really benefit from hearing this on Blu Ray (DTS soundtrack) The story should have match the tracks of this movie as well, as you have some quirky dialogue from the little boy that really slows the movie down.Once you get past this, the story once fully revealed is not bad. If you've ever watched Ninja Scroll( Laser Disc) than you will enjoy this
B002T9H2L0|5.0|If you are starting a blu-ray collection, this is a must have. This looks and sounds excellent in HD. Also, it's a great movie. Like pulp fiction, you have to watch it more than once to truly see the beauty of the film. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes fine movies.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Inglorious Basterds is an interesting film true to the period.  The film uses a mix of humor, shock, outrage, deviousness, and gory retribution to spin a not improbable story of a semi-renegade troop determined to exact a price for the merciless Jew killing German SS.  The actors in this movie play their parts well although it takes a bit of effort to find Brad Pitt believable as someone from the deep south.  Nevertheless he carries the role off exquisitely and leaves you wondering if someone actually attempted to leave an indelible mark on those that perpetrated such heinous crimes.  Overall an excellent film and highly recommended.

0385341008|4.0|This is one of those easy to read, relaxing books that carries the reader forward with humour. Since I purchased my copy it has been through several readers hands, all of whome were as delighted as I was. It's now back in the \\" favourites\\" section of my modest library and I shall read it again I'm sure. The author has a definite flair for letter writing and the book clearly shows this. On top of this the characters are well drawn.
0140367357|1.0|The genius of Kipling, of A. A. Milne, of Ian Fleming and of Enid Blyton is their ability to transcend age, to write in a way that, no matter the age of the reader, there is always something new to appreciate on re-reading.  Sadly, Ms Nesbit does not come up to this standard.  As a child, I adored her fantasies.  As an adolescent, I rediscovered them while reading them to my brother, ten years younger, and found different depths in them.  When my own children came along, I wanted to share with them the joy I had found previously, but instead I came to the realization that Ms Nesbit's political views permeate every paragraph of her works, and that they are written with the specific intent to indoctrinate young, impressionable minds with her Marxist doctrine.    Whether dealing with the relationship between employer and employee, or the rôle of monarchy in ancient civilizations, Ms Nesbit is out to showcase the wicked exploitation of the poor downtrodden masses by the wicked ruling classes.    If you want your children to think for themselves, by all means have them read this book,  But afterwards, for heaven's sake, talk about it with them, and make sure that they see clearly the outrageous fallacies of Marxism.

045122499X|3.0|There are only two differences between \\"World Without End\\" and a Harlequin bodice ripper; excellent historical research, and length.  But Mr Follett has no idea how to handle the length part.  Michener keeps the reader's interest by skipping from generation to generation.  Serge & Anne Golon get bogged down in the minutiae of their characters lives.  Mr Follett, sadly falls into the same trap.  For a 1000 page novel to work, you have to give freeze-frame cameos.  You can't afford to expand endlessly on the minute by minute concerns of individuals.  That was the Golon's mistake.  By the time you get to about page three hundred, it all feels like yet another episode of \\"The Young and the Resless\\" or \\"All My Children\\", or some other endless soap opera where drama rules every scene, and political correctness oozes from every pore.   After that, you're just eager for it all to be over, the conflicts resolved, the bad guys getting their come-uppance and the good guys getting their rewards.  But that takes another 3 novels worth of reading!    Having had my rant, let me say what was good about the book.  Evidently, the portrayal of everyday life in the England of the Middle Ages was excellent.  The language was mature, the descriptive passages evocative.  The characters, at least at first, were well developed, three dimensional, and believable.  In particular, I must laud Mr Follett's careful avoidance (no doubt to his publisher's despair) of the prurient.  With so much debauchery, it must have been tempting to dwell upon details as a money spinner.  Thankfully this never happened.    If you are a thinking person, then I would say that probably this book is not for you.  Its grandiose tapestry is mainly pap for the day-time TV masses; an appeal to the lowest common denominator of historical fiction buffs.  Give it a miss unless you have a class assignment to research 14th century English life, and are too bored by the academic works on the subject.
B002SJIO54|5.0|If you like sci-fi action with a bit of social commentary thrown in, this is a must see! When a human gets infected with a virus that turns him into an alien, who does he turn to for help? The gripping storyline leads up to one of the most satisfying fight scenes of 2009!

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I as well as those that I have given the Series as gifts, really and truly appreciate watching \\"Planet Earth\\"  If you are wondering what to get something for that one that has everything, you will certainly not go wrong in purchasing the \\" Planet Earth Series\\"
B001HN69AE|4.0|I saw how many people reviewed this movie with one star.  I understand their points, however, I thought it was a fun movie. The special effects were good, the action scenes were fun and there were alot of funny scenes.  For a sub two hour movie, they introduced all of the characters and the basic concept of the dragonballs. I've seen episodes of the cartoon before but I never really got into it.  Seeing it urged me to watch them and find out more about the story like how Goku got there 18 years ago and what happened with Piccolo that he wants revenge on the planet.  Even if the characters didn't match completely with the cartoon series, I still found the characters to be engaging and fun.

B002QB1910|3.0|I'm going to be a \\"truth tella\\", as Rihanna suggests that she is on \\"Hard\\": I listened to half of this album under the influence of Jack Daniels and Seagram's gin, so when I woke up this morning and listened to the rest of it, I made sure I went back and listened to the other tracks while sober and I feel the same way I did when I was drunk: What the hell? Rihanna is on some Thriller/goth/suicide type stuff on this album. She totally threw me off guard because I was expecting a sensational LP and got disappointed. It's a known fact that artists create their best music when they have gone through trying times, but the opposite has happened with Rihanna; she has created her worst work to date.<br /><br /> I guess I should have gotten the context clues about how this album was going to be when I first heard \\"Russian Roulette\\" online, because it DOES set the tone for the entire album. \\"Rated R\\" is largely comprised of dark, haunting tracks with angry lyrics. In fact, \\"Rude Boy\\" is the only escape into normalcy. I like \\"Rude Boy\\" because it brought me back to planet Earth for about four minutes. Emotional abuse is touched on in \\"Stupid in Love.\\" Rihanna emotionally sings lines like, \\"I may be dumb but I'm not stupid\\" and \\"My new name is idiot.\\" Powerful and personal. One thing I can say about this album is that Rihanna definitely took us inside her mind, into some of her innermost thoughts and it shows in the lyrics. You can tell that they're very personal, certain lyrics stick out like a sore thumb.<br /><br /> I do like Rihanna as an entertainer, but she misses the mark with \\"Rated R.\\" If you are looking for Rihanna's best work, turn to \\"Good Girl Gone Bad.\\" \\"Rated R\\" is a conceptual album, but I did not enjoy it overall.<br /><br />P.S. Did you know that \\"Hard\\" samples The Jacksons' \\"Can You Feel It\\" and Kanye West's \\"Diamonds?\\"<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br />1. \\"Hard\\"<br />2. \\"Rude Boy\\"<br />3. \\"Russian Roulette\\"<br />4. \\"Stupid in Love\\"<br />5. \\"G4L\\"
B00129H7VS|5.0|I rarely spend money on Blu-Rays.  They are too expensive in my book. However, Band of brothers, like Planet Earth, was such an exceptional series it was well worth the money.  It provides about 10 hours of footage (not including add ons).
B001U7FWM8|5.0|This album is incredible. I've been addicted to it ever since it came out. This isn't just one of those albums you buy b/c there's a good single or two. This is a beautiful record, start to finish. It covers all sorts of sounds and moods... The music is really unique. I know a lot of people who have different taste in music than I do, and they love it as much as I do. Even my boyfriend, who is more of a classic rock guy, went out and bought Veckatimest on vinyl. He agrees that the music is like nothing else out there right now.

1439153663|5.0|\\"The Kitchen House\\"    After reading \\"The Kitchen House\\" I believe that Kathleen Grissom has crafted an absorbing historical tale that probes the darkest edges in this villainous period of American history by employing an extraordinary and distinctive approach. The author cleverly created two contrasting protagonists, Lavinia, the white girl-to-woman, and Belle, the mixed race slave, to move the story alternately from their separate perspectives; Ms. Grissom guides the reader into the deepest reaches of the soul of each character in the book. For me, at least, this memorable cast of characters, from the good ones to the downright evil ones seems to have established permanent residence in my thoughts. While I agree with M. Jacobsen's comment that Belle's chapters could have been longer (I really loved Belle), I don't believe her role to be less significant than Lavinia's. Lavinia, as a white person observes and shares the slave experience from within. This approach is unique, I think. At least, I don't recall encountering the technique in literature, and I found it extremely compelling.     The actual historical events of the period are less prominent than the actions, emotions and motivations of the people who live on either side of the implied, but not to be violated, boundary between the races. I think that the complicated relationships between Lavinia and Belle, Mama, and many of the other characters, allow the reader to discover tiny, but significant, cracks in this boundary through which the plot races along from crisis to crisis and then to the shocking, yet fitting conclusion.    Ms. Grissom obviously conducted exhaustive research into the time period of the book.  As a born Canadian, she must be commended. In the book she succeeded in describing the customs, mores and artifacts of this period in a clear and entertaining way. Often, when reading a novel, I tend to skip over descriptive passages so as not to interrupt plot progression and character development. In \\"The Kitchen House\\" I found the descriptions and details charming and sometimes melancholy. Who can forget, now, what a vasculum is, or forget the image of little slave children pulling the cords of the ceiling fans in the dining rooms to cool their masters on stifling summer days?                                        I enjoyed reading this book so much that I bought several extra copies to share a very inspiring and special reading experience with special people. So, Ms. Grissom - will we be finding out what happens to the \\"Kitchen House\\" characters in the next generation?  Kathleen Grissom's powerful first novel leaves me eagerly awaiting the next, whether or not it is a sequel or a totally new historical novel from a totally different perspective.    Reviewer,   D. Eckert

B001E45XT4|5.0|For me they are pretty comfortable, and the ear cups are pretty big so that is nice. The audio sounds great and the mic is very clear. For the price of 30 dollars they are great buy if you are looking for a decent headset.      I am personally using these for my PS3 with the help of a USB sound card :). They work great on that. People say they can hear me fine and I can hear things moving around me. This was a much cheaper deal than paying $60-70 dollars for turtle beach or the $100+ for Tritton. Usb Soundcards are around 3 dollars and you may want to get a 3.5mm extension jack because the split from the mic jack and the headphone jack is pretty short.    To get this to work with your PS3 you plug the USB soundcard into your PS3 and plug the 3.5mm mic jack into the appropriate slot on the card and then use the extension cable to plug the 3.5mm sound jack into your TVs 3.5mm audio slot. Go into your ps3 settings and set the input to the USB soundcard and the output to your TV.      Overall it was around 35 bucks total for a complete PS3 Headset.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|An amazing account of the lives of those living in North Korea.  I could not put this book down - it really is a page-turner.  Makes you think about and appreciate the freedoms we often take for granted and wonder in awe at how one person can command such a hold over so many.  With the lack of information and news about Asia in the American media, I think this book helps gain a little more insight into that region of the world...and maybe we should be paying more attention.  You won't be disappointed with this book!
B000WC3AJE|2.0|What a disappointment.  I specifically purchased this set because I wanted to revisit That's Entertainment in Hi-fidelity, but the quality turned out to be that of a poorly performing DVD.  What's the matter with Warner Bros.?  It can turn out marvelously reproduced copies of old Warners films in either DVD or Blu-ray, but does not spend the extra capital on MGM classics.
1591843162|5.0|In this book Seth challenges the very economic and educational fabric of our society. Not in an angry anarchist way, but in a straight forward matter of fact tone. His claim that our current way of approaching jobs, schools, and responsibility has left a void that is part of the reason for the dramatic societal shift that has so many wondering where it is all going. He proposes that the age of industrialization has ended and we have entered the age of art. Art being defined as solving a problem in a way that no one else has before and doing so with emotional energy. My favorite example given is found on page 85:<br /><br />\\"Art is original. Marcel Duchamp was an artist when he pioneered Dadaism and installed a urinal in a museum. The second person to install a urinal wasn't an artist, he was a plumber.\\"<br /><br />The book is full of quotable lines, evidenced by the steady stream I have seen on Twitter, Facebook, and in other blog reviews. Two that caught my attention especially:<br /><br />  * \\"Artists think along the edges of the box, because that's where things get done.\\" (page 102)<br />  * \\"The diamond cutter doesn't imagine the diamond he wants. Instead, he sees the diamond that is possible.\\" (page 174)<br /><br />This book is revolutionary in thinking and proposal. Again, not in a disrespectful or militant way, but with great respect and understanding for people. It pulls no punches though and boldly makes its propositions. As any revolutionary work, there are parts that as a reader you will stop and question what you just read. You will find yourself having a conversation with the words on the page, at times, this could turn into a debate as you wrestle with the concept. Some of what I found myself wrestling with I soon realized wasn't a concept, but reality.<br /><br />No matter how much we think we embrace change, there will always be a thing or things that catch us in a soft spot and all of a sudden we find ourselves defending a status quo. \\"Linchpin\\" will bring you face to face with this on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Truth is, if more people would begin to live their lives as linchpins than our society and world would be on a much different and better course. More would be done. More would be given. The gaps between peoples would lessen and even disappear. Seth advocates extreme generosity as a way to get much accomplished. He is absolutely right. Generosity, not greed is the key to success in life. Not just financial or career success, but success as a person. Success in relationship and purpose.<br /><br />As Seth says, everyone can be a Linchpin!<br /><br />Not only do I strongly recommend this book, I have already purchased and given several copies away and plan to continue to do so.re than one occasion.

1594488916|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this book with one exception. The author kept searching for a motivation for John Gilkey's obsession. I was surprised that she did not consult a clinical psychologist. She is a fine journalist and a very engaging writer but her investigation was narrowed to Gilkey himself and book dealers. Luckily I know a clinical psychologist who I can talk to about  Gilkey's behavior. I am very curious to hear what she has to say!

B002JVWR4U|5.0|Much like Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles earlier in the year, 2009 sees another outstanding television series put to an untimely death. And both were on Fox. First, I have to admit I was not much of fan of Joss Whedon's other series (Buffy, Angel, and Firefly), but Dollhouse was nothing short of spectacular. It was a brilliant concept with intense, efficient writing and great character development. Another reviewer hit it on the head saying this show packed more in 26 total episodes than most series do over their lifetimes. Dollhouse is one of the great sci-fi shows of all time. It amazes me how much action, plot, intensity, and growth were packed into such a short series. It's one of the greatest shows that nobody watched. What a shame. And thus as usual we are left with plenty of vanilla shows about doctors, cops, and lawyers. If's a show is intelligent, creative, and original, it doesn't stand a chance.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The love affair was back on. They had been away, grown apart, actually one of them spent years wishing the other did not exist. It's true. It's epic. Well, he was caught up in the moment. Like an octopus waving a spatula at a bobbing army of plastic things, his breath came out as bubbles of air.<br /><br />But what is that smell? Why does that godforsaken clock have udders that you pull on to tell the time? Great Paul's Tonsils!<br /><br />I flagged down a pair of bellbottoms, fondled my Pet Rock (R), and headed for the proverbial desert of the black hole in the memory glistening in my minds. Or as Neil \\"Stretch\\" Armstrong so aptly put it in \\"Cannonball Run 2,\\" just before his Fiero sailed into the Grand Canyon, \\"Pass that on, fruitcake!\\"<br /><br />Street safety is important. I think you probably take it for granted. But I'm no expert. The day grows long like a hot taffy trail or cobwebs laid out on a printing press. Smoke trails like peanut shells, voodoo in the shake of the sheets and a marching band stepping over me as I sleep. Sailing in the in between. Jupiter is so in love with Saturn, he gave her a thousand million rings. Sound the poofy alarm.<br /><br />Somewhere off-putting, like a sidewalk in most of Ohio, I tribulated in ribbed pantaloons. I gathered moss. I was an organ grinder, shredding gristle and bone right onto a monkey's head. You could view it for a dollar. Later, I wet the bed like it was thirsty for a hot beverage.<br /><br />Nursery rhymes haunted me with their morbid sense of finality.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Love all the movies, however if you buy them as singles you save $18.02. you do the math. enjoy the great films. now be a smart shoper.
1441437339|5.0|Interesting from the first page. There's already a mystery to be solved right when you open the book, with a mysterious cane left in Watson and Sherlock's office.<br /><br />Doyle keeps each page filled with suspense and thrills. Even as I read, I could hear the low, mournful sound of the hound that Stapleton keeps locked up baying across the moor.<br />The characters are amazing and funny. Sherlock Holmes keeps me giggling with all of his oddities and eccentrities. Watson is amusing with his normal assumptions next to Sherlock.<br /><br />The mystery is intriguing and darker and deeper than it first appears. The book can actually be rather creepy and suspenseful, unlike the other mystery novels where they're solving the typical robbery, or something like that.<br />The only thing that I didn't like as much compared to other authors I've read was that his sense of description wasn't as good. I had to rely more on my imagination to see the moors as he described it rather than what it really looked like.<br />Yet in spite of that, the novel was comedy, mystery, and a pinch of horror all rolled into one delicious enchilada
B000JLPMPS|5.0|The blu ray version of this disk is excellent, but be aware that there are a number of low light scenes in this movie that are best viewed on a plasma screen.  I've seen this on an LCD, too, and the shadow detail was lacking.  Perhaps a more recent LCD would perform better.  Anyway, an excellent movie that has transferred well to blu ray.
B001GCUER0|5.0|We are biding our time waiting for Season Three to come out in April.  Utterly fascinating and believable.  Expect the unexpected.

B001AQO3Z6|5.0|You have to wonder who makes the decisions to put movies on Blu-Ray.  It seems that they are slowly making every movie into Blu-Ray, but who knows where Koyaanisqatsi is in the que.  Please make this a priority whoever you are.  I've heard horror stories about the 2002 DVD.  That it's substandard and cropped and everything else.  I will not give in and buy the DVD for this movie.  I'll wait until it comes on the Sundance Channel in high-def and just keep it on my DVR forever.  But, I would buy the Blue-Ray faster than you can blink.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|The head set is comfortable and the sound is great.....this head set has a wire but don't worry the cord is plenty long enough.......
B002RSDW8A|5.0|This movie was a dream come true for me because it starred my two favorite actresses. The scenes from Julia Child's life were fun because I remember the uproar that occurred when we started watching The French Chef on PBS. I was thrilled when I found the same garlic press that Julia recommended. The funny thing was that she could not remember where she got it.  I predict that Amy Adams' body of work will be regarded as highly as Meryl Streep's when she gets to the same age. I enjoyed the scenes of Julie Powell's life just as much as the Julia Child story.  The scene with Julie Powell cooking lobsters makes me laugh every time I see it.  The only flaw that I found with the movie is that Julia Child was 37 when they moved to France. Much closer to Amy Adams' age than Meryl Streep's.  By casting other mature actors for the scenes with Meryl this fact is nicely disguised. Totally overlooked in the reviews, the two actresses who play Simca and Louisette are really funny when they fight over the book credit.
B002BW7A58|1.0|First of all, I am not a \\"rap fan who is crying about this album being rock.\\" This CD is SUPER DUPER WACK. And not just because it's rock. No no no, I dont like this album because it sucks. And to whoever said that us \\"crying rap fans\\" dont like this because we cant \\"recognize talent\\" is obviously a member of Waynes marketing team (or a serious Lil Wayne d--- rider).  The guitar playing is LESS than mediocre AT BEST. It sounds like a Blink 182 album with a bad guitar player and Lil Wayne auto-tuned all over it. If you REALLY want rap-rock, buy some Rage Against The Machine. If you want to ride the Lil Wayne bandwagon like EVERYBODY else, buy this WACK CD.    As for the recognizing talent comment, here's some really talented artists:    Rap: Lil Wayne (Carter 2 and older!!!), Bronze Nazareth, Jay-Z, the late greats (2pac, biggie, Pun, Eazy, Big L etc.) Jeezy, Chamillionaire just to name a few.    Rock: Nine Inch Nails, Foo Fighters, Cold Play, Marilyn Manson, too many to name...    Rap/Rock: Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Limp Bizkit, the Judgement Night Soundtrack. It's sad that people think this is innovative when the rap rock thing has been done a million times and has been done 100% better than lil Wayne tried to do.    It's a sad day for THE WHOLE MUSIC INDUSTRY, not just RAP, when Gucci Mane drops a harder album than Lil Wayne. PERIOD.
B0018M6J90|5.0|This movie is so much fun to watch I am hoping for a sequel. Amy Adams must love old movies because she is perfect playing an aspiring actress whose life is an \\"act.\\" Reminiscent of the madpcap films of yesteryear (think Some Like it Hot) the story sails along. The scenes in which Miss Pettigrew and Joe Bloomfield quietly discuss how WWI changed their lives adds an unexpected poignancy and depth to an otherwise lighthearted romp.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this for Christmas.  It is a great game.  My husband and I can play it with our 8 and 9 year old and we all enjoy it.  It is fun for everyone!  It is educational.  It is now our favorite game!

B00005JSGK|5.0|This old movie I used to watch with my Dad who has been gone 11 years.   I got a craving to see it again and was so thankful Amazon had it available......... I have watched it several times during this cold winter.   It is very benign as to real content, but what I enjoy is the relationship of the people in the movie.  They work all day and come home to eat and play cards, dance and sing and talk to each other....... it is a friendly enjoyable movie to keep you company,  reminders of times gone by.   So while not a movie with any real substance.. it is just a gentle atmosphere with sweet personalities......... and simple pleasures.   They are catching animals in Africa for zoos just so you know.   I was a child when I first saw it........ but I found it endearing.... this time around.   :-)
B001E3HTTC|1.0|This is the first Stephen King novel I gave up on.  He's had some short stories in the past that didn't do it for me, but this is the first novel I put down early; not even fifty pages in, it just wasn't working for me.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|Death Proof and the Grindhouse Double-Feature are of course Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriquez's tribute to the junk films that used to be played in exploitation theaters through the 60s and 70s.  For once Tarantino actually decides that he's going to stick to one cinematic style from beginning to end of the film.  Tarantino decides that with Death Proof he will PERFECTLY imitate the feel of these trash movies.  Boy does Tarantino succeed at doing just that.  In fact he does it so well that it becomes the movie's central problem!  I know it sounds contradictory for me to complain about his lack of directorial focus only to instantly complain about how he sticks to a single style during Death Proof.  Just hear me out before you come to any conclusions.<br /><br />The frames are damaged, full of grain, becoming dead on imitations of junk films both visually and thematically.  Both Tarantino's Death Proof and Robert Rodriquez's Planet Terror (the other feature from Grindhouse) use this style...One key difference.  Planet Terror is so over the top that it becomes a BLAST; not a perfect or even a good film, but certainly deserving of a 7/10 star rating simply for its entertainment value.  Death Proof on the other hand is very down to earth in its premise and without many exaggerated stylistic choices just becomes what it set out to be: a trashy, boring film.<br /><br />As a story it is generic (as it should be) following a group of girls stalked by a man named \\"Stuntman Mike\\" (Kurt Russell) who drives a \\"death proof\\" retired stunt car.  He stalks them, kills them with his car, then skips state to repeat the process elsewhere.  He is a fun character speaking in a pleasant Southern drawl, passing himself off as a nice guy.  Too bad he has little screen time compared to our three female protagonists who are boring as can be.  I kept checking the clock wondering how long it would take these bimbos to become street pizza!  After a bar sequence that seems to go on forever (where I have to admit, Tarantino's cameo as the manager is the second most entertaining aspect of this film right after Kurt Russell)<br /><br />I have to admit the stunts in this film really are remarkable.  Stuntman Mike isn't joking about his set of wheels given that all the chases in this film are for real.  When he talks about what a shame it is to have lost the old time values of using real cars and stuntmen over CGI crashes it really shows.  Nothing can top the thrill of seeing real vehicles getting, smashed, slammed, and creating mayhem.  No computer program can compare to live action.<br /><br />After a thrilling stunt where Stuntman Mike kills a group of girls through a straight on collision (while Tarantino delivers the promised Grindhouse style gore) we are greeted to a cameo from by the cops from Kill Bill before moving on to the second act.  This is where things really begin to fall apart.  For the most part the second half seems a poor excuse to show off Tarantino's lead Kill Bill stuntwoman Zoë Bell's skill as she hangs for dear life on the hood of a car during a chase.<br /><br />Like Kill Bill, Vol.2 the second half of this film is so different than the first that it seems to be something entirely different.  Stuntman Mike who is an intimidating, soft-spoken stalker in the first half suddenly becomes an obnoxious over actor.  Now I have no problem, because Kurt Russell hamming it up certainly was amusing for awhile, but it was very out of place given how calm his character was during the first half of the film.  Over the top or serious Tarantino, you have to choose one or the other and stick with it!<br /><br />Speaking of the acting it really is a wonder as Tarantino, to preserve the concept of this being a junk film intentionally baits the cast to do stupid, amateur stunts such as looking directly into the camera for entire scenes at a time, breaking the fourth wall, and just being general hams.  Nothing can be much funnier than a truly awful movie, but the film actually had to be completely unaware of how bad it is.  Death Proof it is clearly intentional, and though this might be amusing when a viewer first notices these quirks, the gag soon loses charm and just becomes annoying.  When you see bad films you want to see a bad film.  You don't want to see an obviously smart director and actors being led to intentionally look bad.  They aren't over the top (until the final ten minutes or so of the movie) so they're just boring.<br /><br />Another problem is the script.  Tarantino is not a great director on a visual level seeing as most of the time he replicates the styles of great directors.  What has always set Tarantino apart as an artist is his engaging dialogue.  That's where Grindhouse is a disappointment of colossal proportions.  There is very little action in Death Proof, which is good seeing as Tarantino isn't that good with action scenes, but the dialogue in the film is just...boring.  It's as real as it gets.  No, seriously: the dialogue in this film is as entertaining as stalking an actual troop of girls.  Only good dialogue comes from Kurt Russell during the first half, but then Tarantino butchers the appeal of that character in the second act.  If you're not enjoying the dialogue of a Tarantino film it means something is going horribly wrong.<br /><br />So congratulations to Mister Tarantino for successfully making the junk film he set out to make.  No doubt this was an entertaining thing for him as a director, but as an audience member I was often bored with this film.  The action is fun, but the final car chase goes on for far too long, but worse is that Tarantino's dialogue in Death Proof is just bland.  There is nothing really working for this film.  It could have been far better if Tarantino had made this a more exaggerated homage because as it is it's no different than the bad films it tries to poke fun at.  Planet Terror managed to give that bad movie feel while taking its premise to such absurdity that it was hard not to be entertained by it.  Death Proof on the other hand is so serious about being \\"bad\\" that it becomes just that.<br /><br />My Rating: 5½/10 Stars<br />My Verdict: While possessing some of Quentin Tarantino's strengths, Death Proof ultimately succeeds in becoming EXACTLY what it set out to homage and parody; due to knowing that was Tarantino's intention Death Proof ultimately loses the fun of an actual bad movie.  As a viewer I can only hope that from this point on Tarantino can try to focus more on creating his own (very successful, mind you) genre of films.  I'd like to see him make an actual full-fledged western in the style of Sergio Leone - maybe even con Clint Eastwood to cameo, but he needs to steer away from making \\"intentionally bad films\\".  Leave trash to the trash directors because fake-trash just doesn't have the same appeal.completely unaware of how bad it is.  Death Proof it is clearly intentional, and though this might be amusing when a viewer first notices these quirks, the gag soon loses charm and just becomes annoying.  When you see bad films you want to see a bad film.  You don't want to see an obviously smart director and actors being led to intentionally look bad.  They aren't over the top (until the final ten minutes or so of the movie) so they're just boring.      Another problem is the script.  Tarantino is not a great director on a visual level seeing as most of the time he replicates the styles of great directors.  What has always set Tarantino apart as an artist is his engaging dialogue.  That's where Grindhouse is a disappointment of colossal proportions.  There is very little action in Death Proof, which is good seeing as Tarantino isn't that good with action scenes, but the dialogue in the film is just...boring.  It's as real as it gets.  No, seriously: the dialogue in this film is as entertaining as stalking an actual troop of girls.  Only good dialogue comes from Kurt Russell during the first half, but then Tarantino butchers the appeal of that character in the second act.  If you're not enjoying the dialogue of a Tarantino film it means something is going horribly wrong.      So congratulations to Mister Tarantino for successfully making the junk film he set out to make.  No doubt this was an entertaining thing for him as a director, but as an audience member I was often bored with this film.  The action is fun, but the final car chase goes on for far too long, but worse is that Tarantino's dialogue in Death Proof is just bland.  There is nothing really working for this film.  It could have been far better if Tarantino had made this a more exaggerated homage because as it is it's no different than the bad films it tries to poke fun at.  Planet Terror managed to give that bad movie feel while taking its premise to such absurdity that it was hard not to be entertainedby it.  Death Proof on the other hand is so serious about being \\"bad\\" that it becomes just that.      My Rating: 5½/10 Stars   My Verdict: While possessing some of Quentin Tarantino's strengths, Death Proof ultimately succeeds in becoming EXACTLY what it set out to homage and parody; due to knowing that was Tarantino's intention Death Proof ultimately loses the fun of an actual bad movie.  As a viewer I can only hope that from this point on Tarantino can try to focus more on creating his own (very successful, mind you) genre of films.  I'd like to see him make an actual full-fledged western in the style of Sergio Leone - maybe even con Clint Eastwood to cameo, but he needs to steer away from making \\"intentionally bad films\\".  Leave trash to the trash directors because fake-trash just doesn't have the same appeal.
0345455681|5.0|[[ASIN:0345455681 London: The Novel]]    Having read this book afew years ago it's about time to read it again.  Along with Sarum it takes one excitingly to the GREAT past, from almost the stone age to a recognizable nearly NOW!  Rutherford keeps the initial characters and follows their heirs to their heirs etc.etc.  This applies to both books, London and Sarum.  He brings the ancient Britain from the small village to become London and the country area in the West to follow the rivers and show how the sea becomes a national treasure.  You get the feeling of the patient and passionate ways they lived and brought England into the age of its dominance in the world.  Highly recommended for all anglophiles and ex-patriots.
B0036RPM8E|4.0|THis is a great bly-ray release. I got this from Amazon UK.    The set list is good, Ok not in the same order as the real show, but that does not affect the release, at least for me.    the Band looks tired, but still, it is a very enjoyable show and the audio is superb.  Only complaint is why to put the encore as a BONUS ? you have to clik in each song´s name to be able to watch to it. not good.    Good extras.    Higly recommended !
0345409671|5.0|Clarifying my review to be, actually, useful.<br />This book, as others have put it, really made one re-look at Christianity. I am an atheist, but I believe if religion was presented this way to me originally, today I might be either agnostic or a believer. This book, honestly, I viewed as an examination of Christianity with Lestat thrown in for fun. :) Even now, years after I have read it, I -still- think of it often. As a matter of fact, if one listens to the song 'Almost Human' by Voltaire, it almost sounds a bit like this books soundtrack. I can't listen to that song and not play the book in my mind like a movie.<br /><br />The Devil is not just \\"evil\\" and God isn't just \\"Good.\\" This book, if it had NO vampires and just had a single stand-alone party, would still be amazing... maybe more so. This is one of the must reads of the Vampire Chronicles, just for the quality of the writing and the questions that must be asked. Anne Rice clearly has a very solid view of Christianity that is based on the writings, not the Church. She is a rarity, and I certainly appreciated it. I might buy a few more as a matter of fact.. a nice hard cover and a few paper backs for my storage and loaners. Seriously, buy the book. If nothing else, the entertainment value is certainly worth the $4-$5 you will spend on a used copy, or the $8 you will spend for a brand new one.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|There are rare occasions in life when the stars of fortune line up.  It happened when actor, singer and comedian Jamie Foxx took  on the role of Ray Charles in the movie \\"Ray,\\" and shortly before its release, Ray Charles dies leaving behind a hit CD, \\"Genius Loves Company,\\" along with the Oscar buzz surrounding Foxx's portrayal.  Foxx received the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role.    The stars of fortune lined up again in \\"This Is It,\\" the last recognized documentary of the \\"King of Pop.\\" Jackson's sold-out 50 show extravaganza was purported to raise the standard within the Entertainment Industry to yet, another level.  For Michael Jackson to die before a series of \\"This Is It\\" concerts while giving a last behind-the scenes look at his work ethic was not only departing on a high note, but prescient in many regards.  By providing a glimpse of the creativity of Michael Jackson, \\"This Is It\\" closes the chapter of the Jackson Odyssey, which actually comes full circle from the early Jackson Five to the pinnacle of solo success.  There will be many more tomes written on the inception, transformation and rebirth of Michael Jackson and \\"This Is It\\" begins the visual dialogue.

B00319ECHE|5.0|This album simply slays the last 3 albums that proceeded this one. It's heavier, more energetic, and brings back the sound of Demanufacture and Obsolete while bringing in more agressive riffing and solos to that of Dino's Divine Heresy. It starts off with \\"Mechanize\\" and \\"Industrial Discipline\\", two tracks that mirror and remind me of the first two tracks off of Demanufacture (\\"Demanufacture\\" and \\"Self Bias Resistor\\"). By the time you reach the third track (\\"Fear Campaign\\"), you have realized this is an enhanced version of Fear Factory, with Dino shining with his modern metal riffing. While there are many who will criticize the addition of riffs and solos, they sound good in Fear Factory. The rest of the album is very solid with tracks such as \\"Designingn the Enemy\\", which is reminescient of \\"Zero Signal\\" with it's melodic chorus and thrashy verses and \\"Final Exit\\" which is the most mellow track\\".    With Gene at the drum throne, he basically emulates Raymond's drumming and succeeds in every way. Always been a fan of his drumming (From [[ASIN:B001B0IPKA Darkness Descends]] to [[ASIN:B000003BX3 Individual Thought Patterns]] to [[ASIN:B000005HNC City]]). Although this album doesn't top Demanufacture, it comes very close.
0316666343|1.0|It started off strong, but that really only lasted the first 80 pages, before it before it trailed off into nothingness.  Here is the issue, I know that I bought it, expecting it to be about the murder of a little girl, and ultimately, her \\"visiting\\" earth to avenge her death sort of thing.  It's not about that at all.  It's about her family.  A rather uninteresting family at that.  The writer repeats the SAME stories several times in the book, perhaps it was a stretch for her to fill the pages.  By page 220-something, I thought, perhaps it was going to liven up a bit. No such luck. Just as quickly as it perked up, it died.  I found this to be dull, and boring. It is by no means a page turner, it lacks a genuine plot, the characters are uninteresting and I would not recommend it to anyone.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I am a huge Killers fan and have been waiting ages for them to release a concert dvd. I found out that they had finally released one and bought it immediately and I can tell you it was amazing, better than I expected.

I would highly recommend anyone to buy this dvd if you appreciate great music.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|Be advised, Abrahamic themes discussed here.    Technicals aside, Avatar appears to be Cameron's take on how the biblical Book of Joshua might play out allegorically but reversed and depicted as science fiction. Imagine a fantasy where the alien, \\"pagan\\" enemies of some futuristic, space-faring \\"Israel\\" instead have the righteousness and might of the true deity on their side. In his cinematic brilliance, Cameron shows just how this futuristic \\"Israel\\" is brought to its knees by its would-be pagan targets. The humans are snarkily depicted as claiming the superior means and values, yet in this fantasy they are THE god-forsaken, rapacious foreigners - in the eyes of the pagans.    The blue Na'vi appear to represent a fantastic version of the ancient, partly-human Anakite giants (Anakite: long-neck) of the bibilical land of Canaan, metaphorically represented here by Pandora. Since the movie is from the traitor's and aliens' POV (Sully: \\"Excuse me, this is my video log here!\\"), there is of course no attribution to any kind of divine hand behind this metaphorical Israelite army. OTOH, it is a force which does possess a thematic proxy for the power of the human's (Israel's) deity, in the form of unimaginable - in the eyes of the pagans - advantages in armaments, high technology, and organization. Not coincidentally, the human (Israeli) army is depicted transiting the wilderness of space from a blighted Earth (Egypt) while subsisting on in-flight rations (manna), bent on an overarching mission to seek their nation's survival and prosperity by winning the rights to the promised rock (land) of Pandora (Canaan). The idea of \\"Israel\\" as the divinely favored people is figured in the movie as humans aspiring to an \\"Unobtanium\\", a \\"Rock\\" no less, which in the end proves to be unobtainable due to enemy action. Which is precisely Cameron's point, and likely motivation.    After being forced to take a swim (biblical Jordan) by the nasty wildlife (biblical \\"land swallows up people andthings\\"), ex-Marine (Israelite warrior) Jake meets Na'vi princess Neytiri, a figurative stand-in for the ravishingly beautiful biblical Rahab. In this tale, Rahab's biblical character as fearful prostitute is uplifted into a stalwart and loyal Na'vi (biblical Canaanite) princess. Then Rahab's biblical role as the Israeli sympathizer who hid the two Israeli spies scouting Jericho is smartly reversed into a die-hard noble pagan defender and seducer. And so this version of Rahab also figuratively plays a secondary role as the infamous Moabite sex-princess who carries out the orders of the biblical Canaanite king Balak (paralleling the biblical advice of the pagan sorcerer Balaam not to confront Israel indirectly) to seduce an enemy Israeli warrior into betraying his own nation. Instead of getting speared in the act with said enemy (biblical Phinehas/Zimri incident) as in the original story, this revised Rahab-cum-sex-princess does get to turn the tables by spearing the enemy Colonel (biblical Joshua). A sneaky reversal of an Old Testament story marvelously retold from the Canaanite point of view.    Among other things, Pandora/Canaan's magical floating mountains stand for the biblical mountaintops from where biblical King Balak and Balaam attempted to hex their Israelite enemies. These figuratively stand for the high places in ancient times where Israelis would not only practice worship, but more importantly also seal holy covenants, or marriages between entities. The offsite Avatar link couch assigned to Sully is tellingly named \\"Beulah\\", which means \\"Israel\\" and/or \\"married\\" in Hebrew. Hebrew prophets were always warning Israelites against marrying gentiles or recognizing a marriage between YHWH and ancient pagan goddesses such as Asherah. In this reversal, an Israelite turns against his nation because he literally marries into a rival religion.    The age of the chief scientist Dr. Augustine and and her expertise in botany marks her character as figurative of the first biblical spy team tasked by Moses to scout Canaan's agriculture. Sully is buddied in a paired spy-team just as in the original story. We are not even touching on details about the ancient Canaanite mother goddess Asherah, associated with the living tree and fertility and child-sacrifice rites. Not to mention sex in the pagan commons-  were private quarters available to sexually-active pagans (Na'vi)? Or did they, like ancient OT pagans, implicitly practice sexual rites in those high places (floating mountains) safe from jungle predators?    Other reverses/parallels abound. The treasonous human science team almost directly parallels the biblical ten faithless spies of Moses's 12-man spy team, of whom only Joshua (figured by RDA Colonel Quaritch here) and Caleb proved strong and faithful (Colonel to initially-zealous Sully: \\"I wish I had ten more like you\\"). Then there are the 12 human sectors which figuratively correspond to the biblical distribution of land among ancient Israel's twelve tribes. And there's marine (Israelite) warrior Jake Sully as a traitorous refiguring of the biblical Caleb who in this revision meets pagan Princess Neytiri (biblical Rahab) at Hometree (Jericho) which eventually falls to the circling human army (Walls and trumpets). Alien wildlife are seen communicating with the indigenes (Balaam's biblically hilarious donkey).    As for the biblical Ark which brought down Jericho's walls on the seventh run after circling the city 6 times, figuratively substitute Shuttle 1-6 and its humongous daisycutter bomb as proxy for the presence and power of the Hebrew deity. Watch as Cameron delightfully orchestrates the onscreen failure of the daisycutter/Ark to deliver the final providential blow, while the supposedly unaligned Eywa-mother-earth (Neytiri: \\"Our Great Mother does not take sides Jake\\") finally does the Abrahamic God divine intervention routine. It's pagan catnip, I tell you.    If today's neopagans could somehow revise the original OT story into a fantastical triumph for the Canaanites in place of their historical defeat and conquest by Israelites, this movie is their gift. It seems Cameron is Speaker-for-the-Dead of all vanquished pagans, voicing ghostly wishes from beyond the grave for what could have been but never was.    Excellent movie-making, though.      ***      Further parallels discovered since:    In yet another direct OT parallel from the Deuteronomy book, an enemy of the Israel would be \\"undercut\\" with crippled legs. Jake Sully's role as crippled traitor-to-be is strongly predicted by this.    Also, go over the movie segment where the executive Parker (figurative high priest Eleazar) is looking at the imagery of Pandoran (figurative Canaan) sector 12. Twelve, which is metaphorical for the OT tribe of Benjamin from which the future hebrew messiah would descend - along with 11 of his apostles, added to which makes yet another metaphorical 12. Parker (figurative Eleazar) then revealingly/mockingly comments, \\"Stop... Where .. Stop. Jesus... ...I mean, look at all that cheddar...\\" Google hint: Cheesus    Marvelously allegorical word-play.

0385341008|4.0|My librarian friend recommended this book to me.  To my surprise, this book was the least favorite of any book she has recommended to me over the years.  The book is a compilation of letters to & from inhabitants of Guernsey Island. By the middle of the book, the pace picked up and I felt more interest in the lives of letter writers.  This is good wholesome story told in letter form -but it is not  an exceptional book. Positives are the book is short, easy to read and tells a happy story.

This is a solid comeback record, writing and production outstanding as ever, but to much of a snoozer at times & too much acoustic guitars.... and I don't understand why after 10 years all they gave us was just 10 songs that were Tedious & Predicable. I love SADE, i really do, but wished gave us something more exciting or interesting to listen to... some remixes would be nice.

B000JMKQX0|2.0|When discussing this book with my cousin he described it perfectly. \\"Max Brooks needs to thank his mother for yelling at him to move out of her basement.\\" This book is frustrating. As you read it, you can tell that while Mr. Brooks has spent a lot of time thinking about Zombies he has very little knowledge of the real world and how things work. He has obviously done a cursory google search on things like weapons, but does not have the in-depth knowledge that superior writers use to create scenerios.<br />Problems:<br />- He has a limited scope of how life in America is for most people, but generalizes it on his priveliged experience. Outside the U.S. his rendition gets even worse.<br />- He knows the names of weapons, but not what they do.<br />- He uses personal political agenda to depict military actions that are ridiculous at best (Battle of Yonkers) that would be ok except so much of his story hinges on this.<br /><br />  Unlike most reviewers who are not enamoured with the book, I give him credit for a cohesive story told in a unique manner. The problem is that you never really care. I have this on my kindle and keep finding myself wishing that it would be over soon and looking down 42% complete .... damn.<br /><br />  If you have absolutly nothing better to do, why not. If the grout in the guest bathroom is a little dirty maybe clean that instead of getting this book.
0694003611|5.0|Goodnight Moon is a short poem meant to be read to a child before going to bed. It begins by naming all the things in a room, from \\"two little kittens and a pair of mittens\\" to \\"a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush.\\" Following this, \\"good night\\" wishes are granted to everything previously named.<br /><br />The illustrations match the book's purpose wonderfully. For example, a bright green room greets the child at book's start and then gets progressively darker.<br /><br />Goodnight Moon is not the only bed-time storybook, but it is one of the most highly recommended for a good reason. The book prepares a child for bed in the best way possible: it gives him the comforting reassurance that everything is in its place and all is well--in his room and in the world outside
B0013FSL3E|4.0|I love the Disney/Pixar movies. I own every one. I eagerly anticipate them when a new one is released. It was no different when they began advertising Wall-E. But Wall-E was like no other Disney/Pixar ever made. Though most of their movies tell some heart -warming story with a moral, Wall-E was much different. In a day and age where global warming and life-after-people are hot topics, Wall-E gave us a vision of what this might actually look like, wrapped up in a G-rated, \\"meant for kids\\" format.    Though meant to be a children's film, there's argument that parents will get more from the messages being sent. It's even arguable that the first half will hold the attention of this ADD generation. With its sparse dialogue, and at times complicated story line, kids just may lose interest before having a chance to see the whole thing. What moral conversations might they miss out on?    There are many social commentaries that Wall-E brings up. First, the desolation of earth and the lack of humans inhabiting it. Outliving his intended position, Wall-E continues to do what he was created to do - gather and compact garbage. But while doing that even Wall-E sees that not everything is trash but finds value, beauty and joy in common, everyday objects. We as humans have been blessed with free-will, intelligence, and creativity. But, as depicted in this movie, we can glean that self-destruction can come from these things just as easily. The world's inhabitants didn't die off but were driven off by their need for stuff. In this story a mega-store called Buy n Large (need I draw the comparison to WalMart?) encouraged this consumerism attitude, thus filling the earth with their mega stores and garbage. The end result was the \\"stuff\\" overtaking the earth and the need to create a space station to save the human race. In return, humans became fat, lazy, self-absorbed, convenience hungry addicts. Most are oblivious to the world actually happening around them. They are physically, emotionally, and mentally fed by technology and the newest generation of specialized machines. This included Eve, a research probe sent to earth who also grabs the heart and attention of Wall-E.    We see in their romance a theme of getting back to the simple things of life. This is actually the running theme to the whole movie. From the artifacts of the past that Wall-E collects while still on earth to the captain learning what farming and dancing is. The captain sums it up himself when he exclaims, \\"I don't want to survive! I want to LIVE!\\"    Have we as a society become consumed with convenience, entertainment, and technology that we have missed out on the simple things of life? Has it taken a children's movie about the future and the rise of technology to bring that to light? Where is God in all of this? Maybe that's the missing link. In our search to find our purpose, our way in life we attempt to fill the void we feel with \\"stuff\\". The pace just continues to amp up in our attempts to find happiness in the consumerism. In John 14:6, Christ tells us that He is the way, the truth, and the life. We scurry back and forth seeking happiness in games, entertainment, and valuables, when real happiness is found in our relationship with God. Wall-E and Eve, creations of the future remind us of the simple things we have lost. Technology, the convenience we've created, are not bad in themselves. The same drive to create new things and improve upon the old (or buy, sell, and collect) can create the potential for disaster. But it can also push us to an appreciation for the simpler things, thus driving us to our Creator and what He has created us for.

B002UCREKK|5.0|Every once in a while a truly clever and skilled album comes along. \\"BELIEVE\\" is such that album, with it's monster lyrics, and strategically placed guitar riffs. It has an '80's feel to it but yet when I listen to it many songs are Rock 'N' Roll even though Orianthi says it's a Pop/Rock album. For me I listen to the album almost every day. This album in a way reminds me of Taylor Swift's \\"Fearless\\" album as EVERY song is a Winner!!! If you like guitar in every song then this is the album for you. I really can't think of an album that is as good as \\"BELIEVE\\" on the racks right now. A little modern Rock 'N' Roll if you will.

B000007ODY|5.0|I grew up on Bruno Walter's complete recordings of Brahms symphonies and those have always been my standard. I would say Karajan's recordings are virtually identical steeped in tradition. Bernstein's recordings while superb are a bit slower in tempo in the slow parts but he revert's right back to expected tempos when things liven up. Bernstein is a BIT slower not grossly slower as some would have us believe but that does drain some sequences of the liveliness they might and should have. After all, Brahms should sparkle and enliven when all is said and done, however, Bernstein's emphasis here is on a rather exquisite refinement I believe the strings might be characterized as limpid, not nearly a dying swan but you get the idea. I haven't heard Bernstein's earlier recordings to compare but if you're interested in what he does with this music in his final years I highly recommend them. Karajan is the embodiment of traditional perfection, every tempo and dynamic correct but I could still argue there is just a very subtle difference between these two conductors performances.

I wasn't sure on what to think until I heard the title track...This album doesn't sound like it should be the age that it is.  It's a different sound since the Ozzy days, but still that shouldn't make you like it any less.  The music is heavy, the lyrics amazing...I wished that I had bought this years ago.  If you're a fan of either Sabbath or Dio, you won't be disappointed.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|what can you say, after 10 years sade comes back and it was all worth the wait. Sade is one class act. I was glad there were only 10 track and not more, too many artist these day put 15 to 17 songs on a disk, and most of it is just filler, unlike sade, you get 10 strong tracks, Soldier of love, Babyfather, Be that easy all great songs. Some people who have reviewed it  and thought it was not catchy enough, but sade is not a pop group tryin to see top 5 hits, its about the grove and the soul of the music. Some people complained about not enough sax, I was  glad they tried small but new sounds, it all sound great to me. This is as always a 5 star cd just like all the others. thanks for the new cd sade, hope we dont have to wait another 10 years for the next.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I have been looking forward to this release for a long time now and it was worth the wait. Sade has come along way in her song writing abilities and it shows on each new release. While some may prefer some of her earlier work because its a bit more 'catchy', it now sometimes sounds a bit artificial/synthetic in style and arrangement compared to her recent releases. Her lyrics in her last two albums have a deeper message in my opinion. As for the music, I love how this lady can incorporate DEEP bass into her music - no one does it better in my opinion. This album may not appeal for those fans still stuck in the past but Soldier Of Love is still a five star album.

B00127RAJY|5.0|For a 20 minute workout, this is pretty tough. I work out quite often,about 3-4 times a week, and found myself out of breath not even half way through this work out. Jillian is tough, and doesn't let you rest. Even after doing level 1 about 4 times, I already feel a little stronger and leaner. I recommend this video to any one who wants to lose weight.   After doing the Level 1 workout, I could definitely see why the video is called \\"30 Day Shred\\". I could barely walk the next day. My calves hurt so bad!
B001GCUNW6|4.0|I've bought this movie for my son. Following it's two predecessors we wanted to have it. If not a good movie at least to have the whole collection, once we watched we find out that in deed the movie is worth spending the money on, is just as good as Ice Age and Ice Age the Meltdown.     This movie has one great new character: Buck, I love the mix of whatever he is and a weasel. He is adventurous and very funny not to mention cool. Combined with Crash, Eddie, Sid and Buck this movie is a knock out!  You'll be laughing more then often.      This would make a great family movie to enjoy when visit comes over or just to enjoy alone. I love it
B002E2M5IC|5.0|this is the first review i've bothered to write but i felt compelled to.  this may be the best motion picture i've ever experienced.  i'm a film fanatic of over 50 years and appreciate the components of the classics.  writing, acting, music, cinematography.  this film has it all.  it's definately the most ORIGINAL film i've ever seen.  i'll view this work of art many times just to soak it in.

0756656230|2.0|I've now read in their entirety both the Lego Book and the Minifig Book which form the core of this collection. As a collector of Legos since their heyday in the late 1980s (think Pirates) to the present, I've seen a lot of Lego memorabilia. When I received this book collection for Christmas, I was really, truly hoping that DK was intending to focus on the complete history of Lego and the Lego minifigure. Sadly, I was mistaken.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the books are beautifully illustrated in full color on quality paper in a cute little collectors box. But in the end, I feel rather let down. For the main book, I was let down by the content. The book focused on the history of Lego for the first dozen pages or so but then switched to the individual themes. I was actually okay with that. I mean, if you want to see the complete line of Legos from the 1950s to the present, buy the 2008 set collectors guide. I would have liked to see a bit more of a review of the early town and train themes and how they developed prior to the creation of the minifig, but I was generally okay with the content and quality of the brief history of Lego.<br /><br />The theme sections are what really got me down. I know Lego sponsored this DK book but, technically at least, this is not a Lego production. It is independent. It has no Lego set number, no Lego pieces, only pictures. Yet somehow it is very obvious from the very start that this book was designed and funded by Lego. The majority of the themes have at least one page focusing on the most recent sub-theme of a series. Be it the 2007 Castle line, the 2008 Space Police, the 2007 Clone Wars, or the recent City themes. They are very present throughout this book. What really irked me was the treatment of the Lego Pirates. They dedicate one spread to the 1989-1996 series of Pirates and another full spread to just the 2008 line. That just seems insulting. The 2-year Westerners series is crammed on the same spread as the Adventurers and Time Cruisers. Meanwhile, other lines like Star Wars (1999-present) get four full spreads or more. I couldn't even see examples of some of my favorite Space lines such as M-Tron, Blacktron II, or Spyrius. They just weren't there! The objectiveness of this \\"Lego Book\\" is very much in question and I would rather call it the \\"History of Lego from 2000\\" than anything else.<br /><br />My larger gripe, though, is with the accompanying Lego Minifigure book. Where the Lego Book lacked in content, the minifig book lacked in everything except visual appeal. Even at times that was in question, though. As with the Lego Book, the minifig book is in full color and on good quality paper. It fits snugly beside the Lego Book in its collector's box. Yet I have a feeling that significantly less time was spent on this younger cousin of the larger Book. Any editor who read this would laugh out loud. Indeed, I have yet to find a page that doesn't have a spelling, grammatical, or factual error. In almost all cases there are multiple such problems on the pages. Besides being about as non-comprehensive as the Lego Book, barely covering more than the last decade's worth of minifigures, the style of this book is extremely wanting. Many pages I have found odd and hardly interesting facts on the wrong page (the fact that Prof. Snape's head was the first glow-in-the-dark minifig part appearing on the page AFTER that minifig was shown comes to mind). In other places, the same exact minifig appears twice, sometimes on the same page even, often with a different date despite the fact that they are the same exact figure. In other cases, I have found incorrect dates for figures, or even incorrect names. One funny error notes that the Clone Wars in Star Wars took place over 300 years, rather than the canonical 3 years. In virtually all aspects, the minifig book lacks the quality-control checks and editing I would expect from DK. It is as though the people who arranged the hodgepodge of images also created the captions with absolutely no oversight. Were the minifig book sold separately, I would probably demand a full refund from the publisher out of sheer anger at the poor editing of this book. While the visual appeal is arguably good, the writing of some of the poorest quality I have seen in a publication.<br /><br />So, my advice is to buy this set if you want it purely for the images. It is a great visual feast of Legoness. However, if you expect deep content and a fun jaunt back into the history of Lego, I'd suggest you wait for another book because this will leave you scratching your head asking: \\"Didn't Lego make more sets before 2000?\\"olutely no oversight.

1594481717|4.0|A Whole New Mind, by Daniel Pink, was a great look at the way business will be done in the near future. I recently spoke with a business owner who was concerned that a person they just interviewed did not want to work 40 hours a week inside his office. I challenged him to think of ways that this person could maybe work out of their home and maybe take on a few accounts at a time, instead of working for 1 hour a day on all of his accounts.  This is the future of our workforce.  People are not interested in sitting in cubical's and picturing themselves in a Dilbert Cartoon anymore.  It is the creative right-brain world that we are after now, these are the new managers and salesforce that the big boys are going after- the rest of us need to adjust now too!

0307454541|1.0|Aside from a missing person investigation that kept my interest for a short while, this book alternates with being too sick and then too boring & is ultimately not worth the time. THREE characters are sadists who target women (overkill, maybe??). The main character is a trite portrayal of what old deluded men probably fantasize about being. The relationship he has with his editor for instance is wholly unrealistic- two people who have sex regularly and work together are just not gonna BOTH be cool and pleasant about the other sleeping around.<br />I found the whole book from start to finish to be a misogynistic indulgence (that the author thought he could disguise with weak attempts at outrage for the situations he created & elaborated on to a sickening, repetitive and quite 'telling' degree). You can change the name of the book from \\"Men who Hate Women\\" in the US reprint, but you're not fooling anyone (I didn't find that out until after I wrote the first review).<br />The character fighting against all this sadism is a 4'11'' anorexic with aspergers syndrome, which begs the question: what is this guy trying to say by making this character so small & defenseless? Part of the first chapter of the next book in the series was included at the end, which AGAIN was completely misogynistic and sadistic toward females- the only difference was that this time the victim was 13!?!! Hmmm... if he can sell a book about violence against small skinny women (& it turns out to be a best seller), maybe he can sell the second one about violence toward children. It's as if the author is 'grooming' large masses of readers into his pedophilic musings. The irony was that this section is supposed to be meant to want to make us run out & buy the next book in the series??? What? Who are these people who want to read about what pedophiles do to kids???? I've wasted enough time with this guy's disgusting fantasies.<br />Apart from the pedophilic and sadistic scenes that make this book 'part of the problem,' the character and story development is sorely lacking & doesn't even begin to compare to Silence of the Lambs (which was referenced on the cover). It veers off into other directions that are just boring & all the references to Nazi's makes me wonder if this author was at all aware of his own hypocrisy; feining outrage at mysogyny in a story that indulges it. That kind of righteous indignation & self-delusion is pretty consistent with pedophilia & I think the popularity of this series is an example of how a seeminly benign veiled pedophile can get into one's head & make you accept things you would never have thought possible. There's no reason to read these books & nothing to be gained, this is just sadism for the sake of sadism.lem,' the character and story development is sorely lacking & doesn't even begin to compare to Silence of the Lambs (which was referenced on the cover).

0316069906|3.0|I read this book because a friend who lately became vegetarian gave it to me. However it was a big disappointment. It holds no new information beyond Michael Pollan's books and it is poorly written. Desultory and preachy and repetitive. Uses common techniques to rile the emotions - a bit like Michael Moore, but without the humor.  Read The Omnivore's Dilemma or see Food Inc. They are much better at covering and informing on these issues.

B00004STPT|5.0|I loved the movie, and I love the soundtrack. Even if you haven't seen the movie the soundtrack is awesome. The sounds that you get out of it is not on any other CD I have heard, I love it. It goes from one song to another, seamlessly. It takes you back to every moment you remember from the movie. I just love that kind of old world sound that you don't hear anywhere else. Every song it worth it, they are all great! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
B0000256VK|5.0|Romantic is the first word that comes to mind. After 25+ years this album is timeless in it's music and relevantcy. I just bought it again for my girlfriend and it makes her, lets say, more than frisky. The band is tight and masters of nuance. Bryan Ferry, well is Bryan Ferry. Brillantly he casts a spell of image and tone that takes each listener to a place in their life they have been or dream of being. Excellant production quality. When I turn the lights low and with my lady the night starts of mutual appreciation, this album amplifies the our spirit.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Amazing voice. We loved most of her selections. Was surprised she had two church hymns--could imagine her singing in church. She sings familiar songs but interprets them in a way that we actually hear the lyrics.<br />She reminds me of Karen Carpenter--not her vocal quality, but the emotions that she brings out of you. Just listen to her version of \\"Daydream Believer\\". The smile in her voice brings out my smiles.<br />One regret: wish they included that one song from the Japanese version, \\"Wings to Fly\\".<br />We can't wait for her next album.
B0025KVLUQ|1.0|I have been a die hard Beatles fan for over 40 years. I purchased the Remastered Mono box set and was so pleased with the great sound improvement, even on average to low quality equipment. I purchased the Stereo Abbey Road because it was originally mixed in stereo, unlike all the other Beatles albums.    The mono remastered CDs are clearly superior to the old fake stereo. But this remastered CD has very little improvement. Yeah, the drums on Come Together are stronger, but it just has no extra oomph like the Mono CDs.    To sum up my feelings on this stereo remaster: meh!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|We weren't prepared to like it. Didn't particularly like the actor who played the new Captain Kirk. But we were won over by the good storyline and the actors who portrayed Spock, McCoy, Chekov and Mr. Scott. It was a great way to reboot the series.<br />The DVD has good extras--the gag reel, an interview with Leonard Nimoy and background on how they chose the actors.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Finally, some real music for us grownups.  Honestly, I have a hard time finding anything new that even remotely does not smack of cinemax-at-night, street crime or sexed-up Disney crap. I have loved Sade since 1984 and while biased, I do love this album (disc?).  I like it better than Lovers Rock.  It is so beautiful and so rich sounding.  Real music should be like this.  A great Valentine this year.
B0031ZWZR2|2.0|I looked forward to this show with some enthusiasm.  I enjoy \\"Lost\\" and this show was being billed as more of the same.  And I will admit that the first episode was fairly interesting.  However as the weeks went by, this show became less interesting.  I finally started DVRing it.  When I found it was time to watch the taped episodes, I could find no desire or enthusiasm to do so.  So I deleted them and gave up on this show.    The main problem is that I just cannot stand the lead actor, Joseph Fiennes, or the annoying character he plays, an alcoholic FBI agent.  I did enjoy the actress who plays his wife, Sonya Walger, as \\"Penny\\" on \\"Lost.\\"  Here she is almost as boring as the actor who plays her husband. (The series delights in showing her \\"FlashForward\\" where she is in bed with another man, they show it over and over.  Very sad and creates very little sympathy for her character.)  They did add another \\"Lost\\" actor, Dominic Monahan, in a villainous role.  However by that time I no longer cared.  Before you get too attached to this series, you should be aware that the ratings dropped week by week, causing ABC to pull it.  It will be returning next month, I believe.  I sincerely hope that they finish the \\"FlashForward\\" storyline since there is a good chance ABC will not be renewing it for next season.  Nothing worse than wasting a lot of time on a series that ends with nothing being resolved.  So you should be aware of this before you get started on this series.  And finally, if you do decide to purchase this set and get started watching this slow and unexciting series, just be sure to drink a lot of coffee beforehand so you will be able to stay awake.
0312427999|1.0|This book is odious.  Are you familiar with the syllogism:     Hitler is evil  Hitler was a vegetarian  All vegetarians are evil?     Naomi Klein would sum up:     Pinochet was evil  Pinochet liked the Chicago School of Economics  The Chicago School is evil     Klein displays a gross ignorance about even basic economics.  She sites a lot instances as accepted truths, but nowhere does she back up her claims with footnotes, concrete examples or statistics.  She claims life was idyllic under Allende and Peron, but does not site stats to back it up.     What's even more specious and odious is to equate the Chicago School with an obscure, seriously demented \\"psychiatrist\\" who tortured his patients in Canada with financial backing from the CIA.  It's obvious she has an agenda.  Not a single Democratic President is mentioned in her political screed, even though LBJ and JFK were in power during some of these events (Indonesia 1965).     She praises \\"developmentalism\\", but never defines it and assumes the reader must agree with the concept.     A few parts that escape her:  ·         The foundation of a free market system is property rights, yet according to Klein Pinochet attacked peasants protesting for property rights;     ·         Another foundation is rule of law and respect for contracts, which were obviously not the case in Chile, Iraq or any of the countries she describes;     ·         Coercion and confiscation of public funds for government purposes is Socialism at its worst,  It has nothing to do with the free market;     ·         How can any of her examples be the free market if the government is the only client?        She  laments the use of Blackwater over UN Peacekeepers.  In Srebnica, UN Peacekeepers disarmed Muslims, assuring them the UN would protect them from the Serbs.  When the Serbs invaded, the UN walked away from the defenseless Muslims leaving the Serbs to massacre more than 5,000 innocent people.  In Ruwanda, the UN knew about the genocide being planned, but walked away and let 800,000 people get slaughtered.  The UN commissions Bulgaria to provide peacekeeping soldiers, and corrupt Bulgarian politicians pocket the money and send malnourished, poorly clothed Bulgarian prisoners to Africa as UN Peacekeepers.  So, I think I'd prefer Blackwater for protection in most instances.     The suggestion that Bechtel build refugee camps has been brought up because the military is usually the first to meet fleeing refugees.  Bechtel is also cost conscious.  Many UN efforts to build refugee camps are fraught with corruption, theft and criminal exploitation of vulnerable people.  In Yugoslavia, UN workers were arrested for financing prostitution rings.     In other words, Blackwater and Bechtel are not a conspiracy, there's a reason it's being suggested and discussed.     She mentions several times how price fixing helps the poor.  In fact, she praises Nixon for fixing prices.  However, she conveniently fails to mention that the result was Stagflation, that George Schultz was against it from the start and the resulting inflation eviscerated the savings of the middle class.     So much of her rhetoric is ephemeral attributes like \\"inner harmony\\" between Chicago school and torture.  This was voiced by an opposition person who was eventually assassinated, so it must be true.  There's a lot about feelings and juxtaposition with heart-rending examples of torture.  It's all insinuation and guilt by association.     Hernando de Soto has done more for pointing out the need for titles and property rights to defend the poor.     As for her point that when ideology meets a clean slate it gets messy, I would put it differently. Lenin took Marx's ideology and basically said, we can't afford to wait and let it happen, we need to force it, we need to break a few eggs to make an omelet.  In other words, the means are justified by the end.  Arthur Koestler in DARKNESS AT NOON eloquently pointed out how morally bankrupt this approachis to any ideology, whether it's Capitalism or Communism.  I don't condone what was done in the name of Capitalism in South America, but it was not Capitalism.  The Comintern infiltrated labor unions and made them useless.  In the 20th Century, an estimated 157 million people were murdered in the name of Communism, more than three times the estimated number of deaths in World War II.  Pol Pot studied at the Sorbonne, but I don't blame the Academics of Sorbonne for the Khmer Rouge.  Communist Idealogues also wanted to murder inconvenient people in the hopes of cultivating a new thinking on a clean-slate.  157 million people.  It puts what happened in South America in better perspective I think.     As for aggressively moving ahead reform during emotional times, that is the nature of the political beast.  After Columbine, gun control lobbyists moved aggressively to push through legislation when emotions were at their highest and anyone defending gun rights would have zero sympathy in any debate.  FDR's efforts to pack the Supreme Court, Rex Tugwell's tutorial from Stalin on the command economy, were all pushed forward when Americans were reeling from the Depression. (Even so, the average unemployment rate during FDR's Presidency was 18%.  In 1937, Tugwell lamented the abject failure of all his efforts to reform his way out of the Depression.)  There is nothing new about pushing reform during unstable times because bureaucracies become entrenched, ossified and hostile to change.      In fact, a lot of the time disaster occurs beacause of these entrenched bureaucracies.  Take a look at Greece today.    If you're looking for reasons to despise Capitalism and you are comfortable with specious reasoning, guilt by association and juxtaposition, faulty syllogisms, then this is the book for you.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|About 4 years ago I was wandering around a large DVD store where I work in Lower Manhattan.  It was St. Patrick's Day week and they had a DVD playing on the tvs in the store of some lovely women singing various songs, together as a group and by themselves.  I recognized some like \\"Beyond the Sea\\" and \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" others I did not know.  I probably should have bought the DVD there and then, but I did not.  The next day I went back again and the same DVD was playing.  I purchased it this time and so began my love affair with Celtic Woman.  Since that day, I have purchased all their other CDs and DVDs, I saw them in concert the last 2 years at Radio City and will be seeing them again at the end of this month and 2 weeks ago I was thrilled to meet them in a personal appearance in honor of the release of their latest CD and DVD.  I have watched \\"A New Journey: Live at Slane Castle\\" more times than I can count and it is impossible for me to say anything negative about it.  So I will just talk about some of my favorites.  First of all, 3 of the women on this DVD are no longer with Celtic Woman: Meav, Orla and Hayley.  However my favorite, Lisa Kelly, is promenently featured.  I have seen her do the songs \\"Caledonia,\\" \\"The Blessing\\" and \\"The Voice\\" probably hundreds of times, she is a beautiful and charismatic performer with a great voice and stage presence. (I was so excited at meeting her in person two weeks ago that I basically blacked-out on what I said to her.  She is just as lovely and as friendly in person, with that great smile, as she is on the DVDs.)  Meav, a beautiful blonde with a lovely soprano voice is always fun to watch with her fun and sexy number, \\"Dulaman.\\"  If you want to hear two really beautiful voices, watch the duet between Meav and Hayley Westenra on \\"Last Rose of Summer.\\"  Another fun song and dance number with Lisa, Meav and Orla Fallon is \\"At the Ceili.\\"  It is wonderfully entertaining.  Chloe, the baby of the group, just keeps getting better and better and she has matured into a marvelous performer on the latest Celtic Woman DVD.  Hayley Westenra, already a star in her native New Zealand, does a lovely job with \\"Scarborough Fair.\\"  I love the numbers where the girls all sing together: \\"Spanish Lady,\\" \\"Sing Out,\\" \\"Mo Ghile Mear,\\" and finale of each show \\"You Raise Me Up.\\"  Finally what can you say about the beautiful blonde fiddler, Mairead Nesbitt?  To watch her dance around that stage, a massive bundle of energy in such a small body, playing that fiddle is a joyous thing indeed.  She is the heart and soul of this group.  I have never tried to review this DVD before because I love it too much.  If you have never seen this DVD before, you should purchase it immediately.  And you will become as entranced as I was when I first saw it four years ago.
B002Q9MZHE|5.0|This is my fourth recording of La Boheme and a welcome addition to my collection. I have been a fan of this opera for more years than I can easily remember. I still love it and must admit that Netrebko and Villazon's performance of the first act love duet left me in tears.<br /><br />The movie settings for all four acts make marvelous contributions to the story and give one a greater feeling that one is watching it all happen. The entire opera seems to go by much faster than the 109 minute length.<br /><br />Although Nicole Cabell has a satisfying voice, her appearance is not as convincing in the role as the other cast members are in theirs. Her interview in the bonus section is very compelling, however, and one comes away with a good impression of her. I'm not even sure I can put my finger on the visual disharmony but I felt it as I watched.<br /><br />I noticed one reviewer criticized Netrebko's red lipstick; I for one found it a rather touching effort by Mimi to bring some color into what was a rather drab, sad life.<br /><br />The Blu-ray recording is very good in surround sound. My only complaint is certain parts in the Second Act were not clearly audible; it seemed as if the sound level fluctuated somewhat. That was a very minor problem and hardly worth mentioning.<br /><br />If you are a fan of La Boheme I think you'll enjoy this performance. I noticed that Villazon took his part of the Act 1 love duet down a half step, but that's not all that unusual; on two of my recordings of the opera the tenor does that and on two the tenor sings it as written. I also noticed he sang the final section as written rather than going up for the high c with the soprano, but that too is not all that unusual.<br /><br />The Special Features are good and provide interesting insight into the cast and the making of the film.<br /><br />Overall it is an enjoyable experience and I'm delighted to have it in my collection!

B000001GJU|5.0|Although this was the point in Karajan's career where he recently left the Berliner and went to Wiener and was trying to \\"bust out\\" as many digital recordings of his previous works and recordings, it is a great interpretation. The sound from this recording is absolutely phenomenal. Although my favorite recording of this symphony is Fritz Reiner with Chicago, the sound on this particular recording is outstanding. The way he takes the first movement slower in comparison really brings out the true quality of the movement. Great recording, would recommend for anyone's collection.

B001FB55HQ|3.0|I've watched this movie 3 times now and I must say I do enjoy the action part of the movie, that being said some of the script could have been much better, some of the lines delivered are just ridiculous. for example the character Marcus delivers a line \\" So that's what death taste's like\\" after kissing the Doctor in the beginning of the movie was very corny. Also there are some major issues when Marcus meets Kyle Reese, didnt Kyle find it odd that Marcus wasnt aware of why he didnt know about \\"Judgement Day\\" he never questions that? The movie was drivin more for action than character development..so if you keep that in mind you can still enjoy the movie.<br /><br />The DVD quality is as follows:<br />Picture is very good even in most of the darker scenes, and the digital grading used to make most of the movie look greyish is well done.<br />The sound dept  for the Dolby Digital 5.1 Mix is excellent, great use of surrounds and Subwoofer which should be expected with an Action movie.<br /><br />In closing I hope the next Terminator movie has some better lines and character development, I enjoyed the Marcus character, but felt it could have been better.<br /><br />So leave your brain on off and just watch the movie and enjoy

B002GY9F9K|5.0|This series is AWESOME. I started watching this as a joke because it looked so cheesy, but then I soon found out that I could NOT STOP WATCHING IT. This series sucks you in; the episodes are so well done. They're very entertaining, the actors are great, the stories compelling. Just watch one episode and you'll never go back. I used to be a fan of Xena and Hercules series, too, so maybe this just falls in line with that type of show...but I think this is even better than Xena/Hercules. I've started reading the Sword of Truth books too, but the show seems better.     About the DVDs, it includes a nice behind-the-scenes look at the making of the show, which I definitely enjoyed watching. There are also several episodes that you can watch with commentary, which is nice because you get to hear the actors talk about fun random facts and their experiences while making the episodes. Highly recommend this dvd set! If only it came in blu-ray...
B000002B1N|5.0|As we all know Nas is an Outstanding rapper. His first album 'Illmatic' is jaw dropping on how he rapped on his survival on the Streets of Brooklyn. Now his second Album 'It Was Written', he raps about how hoods, in his area, dream about being better than what they live, such as his song Street Dreams. He is an awesome rapper who's rhymes will leave hungry for more. Nas' albums deliver more and more, but his latest albums have not been his best. So I do suggest you purchase his beginning albums when he was a young MC.
1400049628|5.0|It really is a complete guide. There's not too much humor in the book. For the serious only.
B00001OH7N|2.0|2 1/2      Another overblown release in my ears. I understand Bowie kicks off an apparently esteemed, extended creative streak here, but thin production aiding showy charisma always highlights how little of his material actually penetrates with songwriting memorability.
B002MU4NLI|1.0|Amazon has mislabeled this particular \\"Two Disc Collector's Gift Set and Limited Edition Ornament\\" DVD of It's a Wonderful Life, as presented in Widescreen in the stats section.  IT IS NOT.  I own the previously released Collector's Two Disc set (full screen), which looks fantastic by the way, and this is the SAME EXACT set.  I bought this thinking it was even newer and was presented in Widescreen, as it said it was, but was duped.  You are only paying more for a flimsy plastic package that will just be thrwon away anyway and a cheap little bell on a thin red ribbon.  NOT worth the extra money at all. SO, the only difference to this one is fancy packaging and a bell.  DO NOT buy this if you are looking for a Widescreen presentation because it is NOT!  Didn't open the DVD at all because when I got it, it even says \\"full screen\\" on the bottom of the packaging.  At least I have a gift for next Christmas.
0394721772|4.0|I bought this for my husband who does most of the cooking.  He has tried a few recipes and finds them easy to follow. He also enjoys the process of learning the techniques that are included.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Just wonderful and I can listen to it over and over. I gave this to several friends for Christmas and they were thrilled. You can't go wrong..!!
B000244FDW|5.0|Slow at first, but it's closer to the book than the 90s mini series.  It has my favorite Elizabeth and Jane.
B002LW9ITY|5.0|I bought this item for myself and decided to give it to my Grandson..I am waiting for a lower price to get another one for myself..Amazon has great prices,,
B002Q4TKZY|4.0|I've been waiting for this wonderful movie to be released on Blu ray in the US.  I've grown tired of waiting and given the positive reviews of this Australian release, I decided to give it a try despite the reports that I may not be able to view the PAL contents.  I figured as long as I could watch the movie it would be worth it.  To my surprise, my Pioneer BD player/TV played all the content with no problems!    The presentation on this Australian BD release looks gorgeous.  The DTS-MA track also sounds terrific.  Apparently there was another release (Canadian?) that got some negative reviews because the transfer wasn't that great; glad I didn't get that one.    The only reason I didn't give this BD release 5 stars is the extra content was lacking IMO.  The DVD release I own has much more extra content, so I'll be keeping both releases.    Great movie, terrific transfer and sound, what more could you want?    Bottom line; love it, highly recommended!
B0012K1ILW|5.0|This album is truly one that grows on you. You might love it the first time (or not), but you will be in-love by the third. So listen, listen and listen again. Pay attention to the lyrics, they are the truth. Do not sleep through it just listening to the beat. Anyway, a beautiful album Ms. Badu. Thank you.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Watch one espisode a night or hold a True Blood marathon; this series is even better the second time around. Not to mention all the bonus footage and packaging.  I definitely recomend to anyone who's a fan.
B000002L9J|5.0|The Queen is Dead, the band's third album, marked a turning point for the band and is commonly thought to be their best. It's certainly their most \\"produced\\" album; when one compares the guitar tone of \\"The Boy With the Thorn in His Side\\" with that of \\"Rusholme Ruffians\\" they'll find a much different sound. The band was at the peak of their careers recording this and while it's not my favorite album by the band, it's one of their most rewarding. For me, The Smiths have always been a band whose songs grow on you with time...Never have I found this truer than with this album. [[ASIN:B000002L7J Meat Is Murder]] connected with me instantly and I would frequently listen to that album in its entirety. In my first few months as a Smith's fan, only 3 songs on this album received repeat listening. Over a year later, only 5 and only a month ago did the title track finally \\"click.\\" This album has two weak links on it and they are \\"Vicar in a Tutu\\" and \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others.\\" Without these two tracks, this would likely rank in my top 5 favorite albums of all time.    The title track here is one of the most accomplished songs the band ever recorded. Drummer Mike Joyce has rarely stood out more and Morrissey's lyrics (which criticize the Royal family), which only he could pull off. It reads like a rant rather anything with rhythm.    \\"Frankly Mr. Shankly\\" features a great bassline and stands as one of the catchiest songs in The Smiths catalogue. Morrissey's lyrics are generally thought of as \\"emo,\\" but even those who don't easily pick up on his sarcastic wit will notice \\"sometimes I'd feel more fulfilled/Making Christmas cards with the mentally ill.\\"    \\"I Know It's Over\\" is one of their more overlooked songs. Musically, it's one of the most depressing songs ever recorded and Morrissey perfectly projects those emotions he writes about. Lyrically, Morrissey captures heartbreak and truth in a way no lyricist can touch; \\"Loud loutish lover, treat her kindly/Though she needs you, more than she loves you.\\"    \\"Never Had No One Ever\\" is (musically) almost a sequel to the previous song. It's short on lyrics and yet Morrissey manages to moan his way through the song almost entirely. But the man does it beautifully...It's a memorable song.    \\"Cemetry Gates\\" shows songwriter Johnny Marr achieving pop perfection. The guitar-riff, the bass-line, and the drums combine to make a song that will get stuck in your head before the vocals even kick in. The lyrics are all-around brilliant with Morrissey singing about long-dead poets, the accusations of borrowing much of his lyrical content, etc.     \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" is terrific and one of the more well-known tracks off of the album.    \\"The Boy With the Thorn in His Side\\" is the closest The Smiths came to overproduced, radio-friendly pop. It took a long time for me to not hit the skip button when this song began but now I love it. It's a little too \\"clean\\" sounding, a little too sharp, but Morrissey's inspired vocal performance will make you swoon.    Then there's \\"Vicar in a Tutu,\\" which is not a \\"bad\\" song, simply a lazy one. There's nothing that really stands out about it and it feels like filler (a word rarely associated with The Smiths, rightfully so).    \\"There is a Light That Never Goes Out\\" has found new life in light of its inclusion in the indie hit (500) Days of Summer. It's a love song of sorts with some of the most poignant lyrics ever recorded, just don't go quoting the chorus to girls you don't know.    The album ends with the weakest track \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others.\\" The amusement ends with the title. It's just a lazy song, once again. Not horrible, but just not up to par with the other songs on this album.    \\"The Queen is Dead\\" is a great album and like all of the studio albums released by Morrissey & company, it's essential for Smiths fans to own it. It's an album that only gets better with repeated listening and I urge you to not only buy this album but show it to your friends. It's a treasure that one should share with the world.    GRADE: A-
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This was a fantastic movie!  I love Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet and I think they gave amazing performances, although it was the little boy who stole the show.  He did an amazing job.    The story keeps you interested and wanting more.  A movie I would watch over and over!
B0007OY2P8|1.0|I watch a lot of the Regency era movies to get costume ideas and have seen and own most of them, but had never seen this movie. Before I bought it I rented it from BB and am so glad I did, because I totally can't use it. If I hadn't seen that it was a BBC production,I would have thought it was one of those awful Hollywood numbers. The costumes and jewelry are totally off...okay, I realize sometimes the directors take liberties, but these clothes don't belong in any clothing era I know of LOL! The use of heavy makeup on even the younger girls, wrong use of accessories, and the hair styles were down right embarassing....I couldn't watch the whole thing and I usually watch Jane Austen over and over....<br />Another reviewer criticized the musical score, and I must say,that didn't bother me as much because it IS a movie. I didn't watch the whole thing so I don't know if inappropriate instruments were shown, or just heard...<br /><br />The best movie I have seen recently as far as authenticity is BRIGHT STAR about the last years of John Keats's life...
B000077VR3|4.0|If you love musicals you will love this movie!  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor did an amazing job - I find myself singing all the songs after the movie is over - they are stuck in your head (but in a good way).      Great fun movie although you might shed a tear or two!
B0029QRA1U|5.0|This is a great LP recorder and player for the price. I have never owned a record player in my life and i  love it. The sound quality is far better than i expected. And it is so simple to use. Just plug, download the software, and you are all set. For the price and what it does you can't beat it.
B0001HAISG|4.0|I bought this movie for my little girl after she rented it and didn't want to return it!   It's a great story that was remade beautifully!  The elements are all there and the music is amazing.    I watch this one with my little girl all the time.  It's great!
B002RV01QI|5.0|As always Enya did an excellent job on the cd.  Beautifuly done and very enjoyable to listen to.  She has an unusual style that I really enjoy.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|This item is very nice, you will find on it all music, writ by James Horner, ther on the movie. All tracks are in the cronological order, like in the movie. by it.
B000FA5TTW|2.0|Totally disappointing. The beginning was good, the middle sucked, the end sucked. Apart frm being totally plotless, this book was ridiclously obvious in its effrots to be aimed at 'awkward's tage of teenage girls. When do I get my four hours back?
0937381888|5.0|The book was recommended by many people and I can see why.  It's great for anyone starting out brewing or for someone who is trying to make the next step to partial mash or all grain.  There is a wealth of technical knowledge as well as the get down to it to make beer kind of knowledge.  It was recommended to me and I'll recommend it to you!  You won't be disappointed!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|This classic movie has stunning textures... the carpets, drapes, clothing, hats, book bindings, the actors complexions.  After \\"low-res\\" views of NxNW over the past years, watching it in Blu-ray is like seeing it for the first time... completely and delightfully captivating.
0894803123|5.0|Lot's of tasty recipes.  Easy to follow.  Plus there is room for creativity should you want to go down that road.  Great little book!
B00243FQFA|5.0|The fifth season was awesome, just like seasons 1-4.  I still can't believe they canceled Atlantis because of SGU...and to make matters worse...I hate SGU.  SGA had it all...an awesome cast and great character development.  The storylines were always great...SciFi at it's best with a solid cast to base everything on.  My favorite episodes in Season 5?  Search and Rescue, The Shrine, The Prodigal, and Vegas.  Joe Flanigan and David Hewlett brought this show to life, and I miss watching every week.  Still hoping for the movie to materialize...but last I heard they hadn't even started production...huge mistake!    SGA was a great spin-off of a great show.  Unfortunately the third spin-off...SGU..just sucks! They should get rid of SGU and get on with the movies for SGA and SG1!
0060531053|5.0|Excellent book to get you started or to answer some questions if you've been brewing for a while and want to take the next step.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|This microphone, being used in a live performance setting, is equivalent to an SM-58, at only a fraction of the price. While not up to the standards of the SM-58B, this microphone has great sound and is very reliable.
1881273156|5.0|The information in the 5 love languages is great information for everyone whether you are married or not. It gives insight into how to help others feel valued(don't we all want that). It is written with an end all be all approach, it is a great frame work but I think there is plenty of room for additional information and insights. I would give this a \\"must read\\" for everyone in a relationship of any kind. Dr. Chapman also has books geared specifically toward teens, children, singles, etc. Happy Reading.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Not enough words to describe what a fantastic film this is. An all-star cast, this one's great! If you're in sales, especially real estate, it's a must-see. Regardless of your trade, the acting is worth the purchase. This one definitely needs to go into your library!!<br /><br />Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin...come on! Great on-screen chemistry, excellent script...can't go wrong!
0446567337|5.0|I have to say that I almost did not read this book because of the reviews on here.  I saw that the movie was coming out and thought well it must be pretty good then and decided to pick up the book...I am so glad that I did!  I could not put this book down.  I cried about 10 different times throughout this book...some happy and some sad.  The book is not just about John and Savannah either, it is about his relationship with his father, him growing an becoming a man and a soldier and doing the right thing even when it kills him!  I read a few reviews saying how Savannah isn't this innocent girl they portray her as and how she was wrong in what she did, but I don't see it that way at all.  I am glad they made Savannah a good hearted southern belle and this is why John fell in love with her!  Savannah does end up falling in love with someone while John is away, but you can't blame her for this...John re-inlisted into the Army when he didn't have to and he had to know he would loose her then and he did.  John made this choice and after that choice is when Savannah moved on with someone else...and I can't say that I blame her one bit!<br /><br />This story is just a great story to me because this happens every single day.  I have even seen it happen to some of my good friends.  They fall in love with someone in the forces and they want to stay with them and they want to love them, but how much of it are they willing to stand and how much of their lives are they willing to put on hold?  I have to say that most of the girls I knew put their whole lives on hold, married the men, some even had their children and then when they thought he was coming home for good to be with them...bam he would say he was re-inlisting again.  Most of the marriages didn't work out and there was cheating involved (probably on both sides though).  This love story is also a story that is so true to life!  I think that is what made this story so great!  It is a sad love story and no it doesn't end all happy like The Notebook did, but it is still a wonderful story!  John makes a very hard decision at the end of this book and it makes you really respect him and love him even more than you already do and you feel sorry for him, but he chose to make the choices he made and sometimes life doesn't turn out the way you expected it would.<br /><br />I loved The Notebook, and it is still my favorite because I relate to it better in my life, but in a lot of ways this book is better than The Notebook! The other books I have read by Sparks are the same old love stories and they were boring and repetitive to me, but this story was awesome!  I loved it and I can't wait to see the movie...I hope it is half as good as the book!<br /><br />Just wanted to say that I saw this movie this weekend and it was awesome!!!!  The ending is much better than the book, but the book is more in depth.  I loved them both!like The Notebook did, but it is still a wonderful story!  John makes a very hard decision at the end of this book and it makes you really respect him and love him even more than you already do and you feel sorry for him, but he chose to make the choices he made and sometimes life doesn't turn out the way you expected it would.

B0036RPM8E|4.0|Live at Madison Square Garden is a lot better than the other Bon Jovi concert DVDs but it still doesn't quite capture the magic those of us who have been to a concert know is the Bon Jovi experience.  There is still no DVD out there that shows why Bon Jovi is the best live band in the world.  Plus the con of Bad Medicine not actually being a live performance but listed as such on the back cover is just plain wrong.  Anyway the tracks on Live at Madison Square Garden are -<br /><br />Lost Highway - still the same average country song no matter what they try.<br /><br />Born to Be My Baby - An all right version.<br /><br />Blaze of Glory - Slow, This Left Feels Right album like in style.  This is one of the best songs, especially the guitar intro they have in their repertoire. If I had paid money for concert tickets and had been looking forward to Blaze, and it was played like this, I'd be really annoyed.  Slow style nice for an alternative sounding album but not at a concert.<br /><br />It's My Life - The bar graph lights on the wall behind are really getting into this song.  Alas Jon pretty much just stood there and pointed at the roof a few times and did a few upper body frog/breaststroke actions.<br /><br />Keep the Faith - Jon whips out some Mexican shakers like he's in some primary school music lesson instead of playing in front of a crowd as an adult performer.  Wearing a vest and shaking the shakers around he looked just a tad foolish.  Some nice close ups of Richie's hands playing the guitar and showing how hard would be to do though.<br /><br />Raise Your Hands - Well when they started playing this we finally found out the crowd was alive and not just sitting there. Highlighting the poor choice of the way they were playing the songs before this one. Bon Jovi has been watching a few Wiggles DVDs (as is evident by that awful Fast Cars songs on Circle) and Jon copies the skivvy boys' moves.  Instead of the usual \\"Give me a V\\" shouts he usually does to the crowd, he and the crowd do starjumps but without the actual legs leaving the ground part of the move.<br /><br />Livin' in Sin - Not a Bad rendition.<br /><br />Chapel of Love - Going to the Chapel and We're Going to Get Married lyrics do add to the stalker vibe of Always that followed but they should have mentioned the words, who likes a good stalker song or Always is coming up or something as the crowd had no idea what was going on.<br /><br />Always - Jon starts mumbling a bit when talking about birds don't fly and words don't rhyme, then mumbles again at the end.  It's like he bit his tongue or something before telling his victim he will love her always.<br /><br />Whole Lot of Leavin' - Sounds all right but no huge fan of this song, better than the Lost Hwy album version though.<br /><br />In these Arms - Not bad but Jon's voice gets a bit winey during some of it.<br /><br />We Got it Going On - Enough with the Lost Hwy songs, I just pressed skip however if you were at the concert you'd have had to endure it.<br /><br />I'll Be There for You - Solo by Richie.  Actually probably sounded better than Jon would have with his deteriorating voice at this stage of the night.  David also backed up with the lyrics. Shows maybe what might happen if Jon died and Bon Jovi kept going with the tours.  Not sure why this happened, if it was just to rest Jon's voice or an admission that two hours is a long time for the ageing singer and his older bladder just can't last for two hours without being emptied.<br /><br />(You Want to) Make a Memory - Jon comes back on stage in a pink shirt for this ballad.<br /><br />Blood on Blood - Still wearing the pink shirt starts singing close to the crowd while some middle age woman yells a one sided conversation with him as he sings.  He then walks around a row in the crowd, so the cameras don't capture her being removed by security.<br /><br />Dry Country - Pretty good sounding but has back turned to the audience for a fair while.<br /><br />Have a Nice Day - Reawakens the crowd after the slower Dry County ballad.  Is a good choice for a concert playlist for this reason.<br /><br />Who Says You Can't Go Home - Many in the crowd wished they knew if this was the last song for the night or not as they would have done just that if it was.  Just as annoying live at Madison as on the ablum.<br /><br />Hallelujah - I skip any religious propaganda, Bon Jovi used to be about the religion of Rockn' Roll now he's singing Praise the Lord. What happened to the inflatable devils and half naked inflatable women of past decade concerts? So many good songs left out of the night's playlist for this.<br /><br />Wanted Dead of Alive - Just like Blaze of Glory, the cool guitar intro is not present.<br /><br />Livin' on a Prayer - Asks the Crowd \\"So What?\\"  They don't have an answer let alone the usual \\"We'll Give it a Shot\\" reply.  Never understand why they get such un into it crowds on the nights they film these DVDs.<br /><br />Bad Medicine - Just the recorded version played over the credits.  A pretty big con, this is not mentioned on the DVD cover.  It implies it's part of the concert on there.  There really is no excuse for this it is just misleading.<br /><br />You Give Love a Bad Name - Very well done but not part of the concert DVD, you have to reach this by bonus track.  Clearly it was filmed at the concert and near the start due to costumes had on at time.  Why not just leave it where it was?<br /><br />Runaway - Again very well done, makes you also wonder what great songs and concert staples might have been played and left off the DVD such as Lay Your Hands on Me, Sleep When I'm Dead and the always interesting to see how the opening guitar rift is played this time round, Something for the Pain.<br /><br />Bed of Roses - Obviously from Pink Shirt part of the concert.  I don't really like this song but this is the best it's ever sounded.  Jon does the most crowed interaction of the night walking around with security and holding women's hands and things like this.<br /><br />Easily the best DVD of the live concerts but also some obviousness that they are getting on a bit at times with Jon's voice and so forth.Who Says You Can't Go Home - Many in the crowd wished they knew if this was the last song for the night or not as they would have done just that if it was.

B001URY5IU|4.0|This is a great set.  I have the Hoth Rebel Base and it goes really well with it.  But it is rather expensive for only about 150 pieces.  It comes with great figures and the Ton Ton is great but there should have been either more pieces or it should have cost less.  The base is okay but I would rather have had more guys or a snow speeder.  Well here are my pros and cons  Pros.  Great figures,  Good turret gun and snowtrooper gun,  Ton Ton,  Cons.  Not enough pieces,  Should have had something besides a little base,  Well I still love this set. There are still some cons but over all it is one of the best Lego Star Wars sets that they have come out with that is still fairly cheap.  I would recommend it to any of my friends especially if you can get one of the new battle packs, either snowtrooper or rebel trooper.
B000002LCK|2.0|The entire CD case was cracked all over and it appeared that it was put in a blank CD case, was not original casing or brand new as stated in product description.
0199267170|3.0|The print is surprising readable in this fairly compact, one-volume complete Shakespeare.  It is well organized and more than good enough for this non-scholar to use as a reference book.  We also read the plays out of this when the mood seizes us.

B00005N6KG|5.0|Great headphones for someone who's ears do not fit earbuds. These fit in ears nicely and stay put when doing high impact cardio or weight lifting. Excellent sounds as well.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Brilliant CD. Played it constantly since buying, even as background to students working at school. They like it as well, so it must be good!! Loved the tracks I recognised, but also lots of new tracks I didn't know. Excellent value.
B00012L786|4.0|Samuel Fuller's \\"Pickup on South Street\\" is an outrageously entertaining mashup of film noir conventions and the Red Scare of the early 1950s. Once again Richard Widmark plays a charismatic cad--but this time a redeemable one; he's pickpocket Skip McCoy, who grabs a package out of Candy's (Jean Peters) purse on the subway. What Skip doesn't know--and neither does Candy--is that the package contains microfilm that bears a top-secret formula the Soviets want. Joey (Richard Kiley), Candy's sinister boyfriend, has been using the unwitting Candy as a courier to steal U.S. secrets and hand them over to the Reds.<br /><br />The story takes improbable but riveting twists and turns; Skip tries to pressure the Commies into a big payoff, while he and Candy, improbably but entertainingly, fall in love. Meanwhile, the evil Joey is out gunning for Skip and anyone else who gets in his way.<br /><br />Fuller keeps the tension up at near-hysterical levels, and at the same time creates a fascinating, Dickensian underworld in 1950s New York. Just because someone beats you up or rats you out in that world doesn't mean he or she doesn't love you. The brilliant performances help a great deal; best of all is Thelma Ritter, in what may be her all-time best performance as Moe, a sad, worn-out snitch whose only remaining ambition is to buy herself a grave. (As for Jean Peters, who could believe that only two years later she would play the serene, virtuous Catherine Marshall in \\"A Man Called Peter\\"?) \\"Pickup on South Street\\" is great, outrageous, compelling fun for anyone interested in film noir.
B000MV8XPG|4.0|My sons loves this excavator. It was a little hard to put together since it came from Germany and only had pictures to go by but I was able to put it together anyway.
B00338QENI|4.0|First, I did enjoy the book. It is a good story, and Henrietta Lacks's story deserves to be told. Ms Skloot did a good job at making the story engaging, and the time line at the beginning of each chapter was a useful tool.    But how many times do we need to hear about the author stretched across bed with Deborah, looking at papers? Or the muddled misinterpretations from the Lacks family about money to be made from the HeLa cell line?     For what it's worth, I worked with HeLa cells in the 1980-1990s, and at that time I knew Henrietta Lacks's name (though I thought it was Lack, not Lacks) and that she was a African American woman who had died in the 1950s. So, although her story was not in the popular press, it was certainly widespread enough in the scientific community that I knew her name when I was a young lab tech.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I was totally amazed that ALL of her songs were sung with such style. I knew she had a good voice but on this album each song was sung with a different approach. I've given the album as a gift to many of my firends.
B00275EGX8|1.0|What a load of crap!  This is the biggest waste of time I have sat through in a long time.  Unrealistic, poor story line, shallow characters and the most annoying camera work you can imagine.  I don't understand the recent surge in the directors looking for a shakey look in the way they shoot films.  It does nothing but make me dizzy and leave me feeling ill.<br />This movie is not worth the plastic its embedded in.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Okay, so I've read all the books and I understand the true fan's quibbles about the series not being \\"faithful\\" to them, but heah, TV is a completely different medium and I for one actually prefer how they cut to the chase and get to the action, the humor or the drama and the soap opera between the characters.  The writers are really doing a bang up job presenting the overall ethos of the novels as well as the designers who are creating a beautifully rendered world for the all the breathtakingly beautiful and extremely talented actors to inhabit.  The essence of all the characters is being very loyally adhered to and the sword and sorcery action and effects are as good as I've seen in any recent hour long series.  The writers are also staying true to the general direction of the Seeker's quest and the disparate obstacles he and his beloved Kaylan encounter along the way.  I really like how the series has already woven in important characters into the first two seasons that only appear in the 5th or 6th book.  I wait with great anticipation for each new installment to be aired and look forward to owning the second full season when it is released on DVD.
0805091742|5.0|This is a seminal book that should be required reading for all patients,physicians and healthcare workers. Fidelity (an unlikely circumstance) of healthcare delivery processes leads to improved patient safety and measurable quality enhancement.  If you're a physician, who does not need to use checklists, would you be willing to tell the physician or surgeon treating you that you do not want she/he to use a checklist as she/he treats you? If yes, stop and read this book. Alternatively, increase your malpractice insurance!
B002SG8A56|5.0|Seriously.  This is one of the funniest series ever produced.  Makes me want to move to New Zealand and live like a hobbit.  Brilliantly written, hilarious story lines, quirky songs.  If HBO is smart they would do whatever it takes to get them to do a third season.  It's business time!
0060920084|2.0|A friend gave me this book for Christmas and I just recently took the time to read it.  I'm glad I did.  Bryson's descriptions of the people he met in his travels seem to hit the nail on the head and made me say \\"I know that guy\\".  On the other hand I couldn't understand why it was that Bryson made this trip alone. (Maybe the rest of his family was mad at him.) I found his comments about his father to be distasteful.  Most of the places he visited he wrote about negatively, finding fault at the least little thing, with very few exceptions. It was as if he expected them to jump with joy upon his arrival. He apparently ran into some trouble in the west as he spent  a lot of time denigrating their way of life as compared to the mid-west, and then to top if off he moves to Hanover, N.H.??  There is no doubt that there is a lot of humor, or just plain funniness in his writing, but at the same time there seems to be a lot of \\"put downs\\", the waitresses, the bar tenders, the gas station attendents, etc. I wouldn't recommend this book as a travel guide because I think Bryson  missed many of the really interesting places in the U.S.  He seemed determined to visit the little out of the way places that are just trying to survive. Anyway, I did find the book entertaining, mostly because of his descriptions of people, i.e. the breakfast waitress was really and accurate description of what most of us have experienced, but we must also remember these are usually young people trying to earn enough money to go back to college in the fall...Bryson seems to ignore this. Probably he would do better as a stand-up comic. I would recommend this book if somebody wanted something to just plain laugh at, but not to find a true description of the America that I know.
B0011UCOGG|5.0|Paolini's works show his increasing skill. I am more enthralled and moved by the series as it grows in complexity and the characters become more dynamic. To the complainers about violence: These books are not for children just because there are dragons in them.

B002T9H2MO|2.0|\\"Moon\\" is light instead of dark, safe rather than adventurous, and more tedious than watching \\"Solaris\\" for the fifth time.  I'm gonna take a shot in the dark here and guess that Duncan Jones (the former Zowie Bowie[!]) digs Stanley Kubrick.  There's certainly nothing wrong with that -- until you make a movie that mistakes pale imitation for homage.  Ground control to major Tom: your circuit's dead, there's something wrong....
0385504225|2.0|Does the world really need my two cents about this book? No. Will anyone read this? Probably not - but I made a deal with myself that I would write a review of all the books I read.<br /><br />Once again, Robert Langdon must race against time and a villian as improbable as an Ayn Rand character to save - something. (I was never very clear on this point) When it is not excessively preachy and wordy, this tome reads like a screenplay. I found it utterly forgettable and to be completely frank - boring. There, I said it. If this were not a book club selection, I would have never been able to finish.<br /><br />I am perpetually mystified by the books that become the latest popular craze - but I am happy that people are reading.

B00005JKCH|5.0|Purchased this DVD set to replace the VHS tape we had originally, so that we could watch it on our new tv.  Great buy!
B000VH34LY|5.0|I have to agree with the others that adding the remixed material was completely unnecessary. The original cuts stand well on their own. The way that the remixed songs are mixed in with the original material is peculiar also. I would have prefered the original stuff on one disc with the remixed on the other. That way it would be easier to avoid the latter.
0743539478|5.0|First of all, it was such an easy transaction. The seller shipped right away, so got it right before Christmas. My husband thought it was one of the best Dan Brown books. He would literally sit outside the house to just listen to it ( I would have to come out and get him).

B002YIHO7I|5.0|Sade, continues to make and put out quality material that her fans admire and respect. Thank you a million times over for a bangin cd with well written songs, amazing production and voice like no other.
B0030BOCEG|5.0|When first hearing the first single \\"Heartkiller,\\" I could already sense that HIM might be going for a pop feel.  Maybe leaning towards the days of \\"Dark Light,\\" where through MTV2 and Bam Margera, HIM was reaching out for a bigger audience outside of us core group of fans who knew them since \\"Greatest Love Songs 666.\\"  While unsure on how to feel about \\"Heartkiller\\" at first, like with most bands I love; I gave it a chance.  Listening it to quite a few times and seeing the music video made the song grow on me.<br /><br />Upon picking up and listening to the album today, \\"Screamworks\\" gives somewhat a variety of songs that move from one side of the spectrum to another.  Songs like \\"Heartkiller,\\" \\"In Venere Veritas,\\" and \\"Scared to Death\\" gives a pop feel.  \\"Katherine Wheel,\\" \\"Like St. Valentine,\\" and \\"The Foreboding Sense\\" still have some of the love metal feel I've come to be familiar with. \\"Ode to Solitude\\" and \\"In the Arms of Rain\\" sound like something that could come from the Depeche Mode.<br /><br />While the pop songs sound kind of kitschy, Ville's romantic lyrics are still dominate throughout.  One of my favorite lyrics so far comes from the song \\"Disarm Me (with your Loneliness),\\" which still shows the darkness and tragedy that comes with love.  \\"Three Seven into three sixes again you laughed in my face when I told you how much it hurts.\\"  Though the sound is different from anything you and I have heard, Ville's poetry still shows if you can get past the music.<br /><br />Overall I throughly enjoyed the album.  The second disc on the special edition is great even though they are just basically acoustic versions of the 13 songs.  It's worth a listen.  In addition, if you want some live tracks, iTunes has \\"Heartkiller\\" and \\"Love the Hardest Way\\" from Helldone 2009 for download.  In comparison though to other albums such as \\"Venus Doom,\\" and \\"Razorblade Romance\\" it does fall behind a few steps musically.  I enjoyed it all the same though and am looking forward to listen to these songs live when I see them in concert in April.s live when I see them in concert in April.
0439023491|5.0|Well... it was a present for my daughter. She liked the 1st. part...The Hunger Games, so now he got the 2nd. part..and waiting for the 3rd. that is going to be released on august!! She loved these books so much, that were read on 2 days only!!
B00006CXSS|1.0|After receiving this Christmas present, one of the disk was scratched in the box.  I attempted to contact Amazon for a replacement disk but was unable to get a hold of anyone.  So now I have a scratched disk and can't see part of the campaign.  This is my first time being disappointed with a product i've purchased from Amazon, and it will make me reconsider purchasing in the future.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|We had seen this video before so I bought 3 of them. One for my husband, one for my father in law, and one for my brother in law. And the price was great. I buy a lot through Amazon for just this reason. The ending was a little sad but the movie overall was excellent!

B00333NCTM|5.0|When I purchased this book I was looking forward to hearing the insane tales that Ozzy has to tell, and there are plenty and they are funny! But if you think you know Ozzy from all of the stories spread over the years, you don't. I think the thing that opened my eyes the most in this book is how fragile this man really is and I give him great credit for opening up and sharing his story. The book is not filled only with the rock-n-roll stories but his feelings and struggles in living with addiction. Great job Ozzy, and Sharon (as she deserves a lot of the credit here too).
0307593525|5.0|I ordered these books after watching the movie \\"Julie and Julia\\". I love these cookbooks, they have well laid out instructions that give you confidence in attempting even the difficult recipes. These are not recipes for 30 minute meals, this is old-fashioned cooking where you have hours to devote to it, great for weekends that you're snowed in.  There are suggestion with entrees for vegetables and wine that compliment the entree.  And the recipes are very good.  My family and I have enjoyed every meal I have made so far from the books.  These recipes have brought a renewed interest in food and are always fun and exciting for me and my family to enjoy.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|I have been a Sade fan for years. It is so nice to here a smooth and original mature album. The music is beautiful. It wasn't her best album, but certainly worth adding to your Sade collection. You can play it from beginning to end without a need to skip around.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I own this myself and just bought it for my granddaughter.  It has exceptional music and a beautiful story. Adults will enjoy this as much as the children.
B000A2H9BQ|5.0|This CD is a wonderful introduction to the music of John Martyn. It is very much an acoustic CD with a relaxed, improvised feel. John Martyn's unique singing and guitar style are well worth listening to. Another highlight of the album is the warm and resonant double bass playing of Danny Thompson. Lovers of acoustic music will not be disappointed with \\"Bless the Weather\\". Recorded in 1971, I think this is John Martyn's best CD. Ignore the radio version of \\"May You Never\\", but every other track is well worth the purchase price. The best version of John's classic song, \\"May You Nver\\" appears on his CD \\"Solid Air\\". If you enjoy John Martyn's music, consider this CD as well.
055380684X|5.0|\\"Outliers\\" by Malcolm Gladwell, is an awesome book on greatness. Like a great general science manuel.   \\"The Talent Code\\" is like physics. It is breaking down how the mind works when principals such  as \\"10,000 hours\\" of training to master a craft (soccer, art, teaching) are applied. It gives  great insight into how the mind processes learning. It even tells you how to train the mind to think  when learning to play the violin (perfection is hitting the one note \\"exactly right\\") vs playing soccer,  which has an infinite number of reactions and actions that equal perfection. I really enjoyed the book and   hope he comes out with more reads to help understand the awesome process of learning.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Pretty neat game. I like the idea of the variablility of the game each time you play so it doens't get too old.
0307388921|4.0|A novel about sex addicts.  See also: DUH.  See also: Sure Thing.  See also: Bestseller.  \\"So fine,\\" we think: this must have been easy.  How could you lose?  And then you begin reading.  Try this: draw a cross in the margin every time Christianity is referenced.  Draw a ( ) every time Palahniuk references a butt.  A \\"Ha\\" for every joke; a \\"Nice\\" for every brilliantly turned phrase; the character's name every time someone new is introduced; an \\"F\\" every time characters F---; and a null symbol every time Palahniuk illuminates Nothing.  The margins will be filled.  You'll end up with a freakin' flip book movie.  Somewhere, Hemingway is smiling.  Instead of Hail Marys, the young Victor Mancini must have been assigned recitations of \\"Our nada which art in nada...\\"  The novel's title is your first clue that everything is exactly as it looks and nothing at all as it appears, simultaneously.  Everything has so many levels of meaning that half the audience is laughing, half the audience is crying and the other half (yeah, I don't know how he does it) is vomiting in the aisles.  Orifices.  There are more orifices in this book than you can shake a stick at (and that's in there too).  One moment you're recalling the witches from Macbeth:  \\"Fair is foul, and foul is fair.\\"  The next, you're humming five different Rolling Stones songs.  All the while perusing the warning label on a tube of KY Jelly.  There is legend, myth, faith, history, psychology, prophecy and some geology for good measure.  If you're one day visited by aliens who want to read one book and understand what it means to be human, smile and hand them \\"Choke.\\"[[ASIN:B0032JTVGU Only Shot At A Good Tombstone]]
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|When I recieved it, I quickly opened it up and watch all 6 movies,including \\"The captins Summit\\". I LOVED IT......  if you LOVE Star Trek, this is a must have to your collection.
0756655730|4.0|In general I agree with many of the other reviewers. It's a well-illustrated book, discussing each time period, with beautiful photographs of fossils. I also enjoyed how plants were featured, a vital component of any environment, which are frequently shortchanged in these sorts of tomes. There was also detailed information about featured lifeforms, as opposed to the 'Evolution: Story of Life' book, which this has been compared to.    However, unlike others I was not impressed with the CGI illustrations. Few seem very lifelike, some barely 'adequate', and many are in static poses on an unremarkable backdrop (i.e. blue water, green grass, ect). Additionally, there's far too much emphasis on small fossils in the photographs. The giant arthropods of the Paleozoic are barely even mentioned. I suppose it's easier to prominently photograph a half-inch long trilobite rather than a six-foot eurypterid, but to fail to include these remarkable creatures even in CGI reconstruction? Hardly 'definitive'.    Despite these shortcomings, it IS a wonderful book, especially for the pricetag. However, I recommend 'Evolution: Story of Life' as a companion book, as it's better for full environment reconstructions. I purchased both, and the two compliment one another very well.
B002BW7A58|5.0|MR. Wayne took a gamble and it paid off very well. Im a fan of all music and this album absolutely blew my mind very creative and lots of emotion was poured into the production.

B0006SSOHC|5.0|Very rarely do horror movie franchises work. Usually the original film is well-written and scary, but most Hollywood producers make sequels to make money with mediocre scripts and untalented actresses juggling their upper portions of their bodies to be discovered. However, the \\"Saw\\" series of films are all freightening, hair-raiing, fast paced, involving, and, blood-curdling. The plot is simple: a psychopath named Jigsaw kidnaps people who take their lives for granted and puts them in torture chambers to see who can escape. The \\"Saw\\" films are not for the faint of heart, so if you have a weakness for gore these are not for you to view. But, if you want good horror that will scare you out of your seat watch the \\"Saw\\" films. I can't say I have a particular version I like the best, for all the sequels are well produced and follow the same formula as the original. As of 2010 there have been six \\"Saw\\" films, usually being released to theatres the week before Halloween. The latest \\"Saw\\" film, unfortunately, was not as successful as its predecessors.
