B000F9T7E6|2.0|Vinyl sound really bad, cheap item, I do not recommend it.....<br />Great music indeed, but poor quality vinyl.<br />hé ho.
B00931JMRE|5.0|Sounds like something they would have recorded back in their early days. Great to listen to on road trips, highly recommended
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I typically don't read fiction, especially science fiction, but I found this book refreshing and tremendously enjoyable. One where every time I put the book down, in was always wondering what happens next. Loved it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game!  Good puzzles.  I like that you have to find objects and use them to get out.  Overall a fun game!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Loved this movie.  Wildly entertaining, brilliant work of fiction from a master.  I will probably watch this movie several more times in the near future.  Must see.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it. Really makes you think about how you or anyone you know would handle such a thing as being thrust into a situation out of your control but then looking deep with-in yoursdelf and doing what you feel is right. I know this book will be a 2 part movie and really can't wait. Outstanding
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun!  Challenging enough to keep you playing but not so much that you Want to give up.  Highly recommended!
B004P12SSW|4.0|I really liked this movie. Feel the acting and dance sceens were very good and have always like Cher so made me want to see it.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I fully admit to ignorance, but when I first watched The Adventures of Tin-Tin, I thought it was about some live-action robot. And I was like, \\"this is probably going to be weird-ish\\". So, you must imagine my enormous delight when, in fact, it is NOT about a weird robot, but rather one of THE most enjoyable animated films I have ever seen! It had the perfect amount of wit, humor, action, thrill, suspense, and \\" happy ending\\"! I love this movie!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book and can't wait for the movie. Will be interesting to see how the movie handles some of the things left out of the first movie but am sure it will be outstanding.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this movie, but the writing and pace of the film are just too darn slow.  The wife fell asleep, and I couldn't wait for the movie to be over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Outstanding is all I can say. I guess I did this in reverse of most people. As I did not have interest in the movie when it came out and have only recently watched it. The movie was outstanding and made me curious as to just how good the book would be as the movie can never tell the whole story as they have to fit so much in to a 2 hour slot. So I loaded up the book and used Audible for Android and listened to it as I am not a reader. All I can say is after a sleepless night I had listened to the whole book and left me wanting more of the story. Great read or listen in my case.
0425252868|5.0|We already know from our history classes that Adolph Hitler was, at the very least, an evil, deranged, maniac with an ego problem. This book reveals to the reader another side of at least one German pilot who did not buy into the Nazi philosophy but loved to fly and loved his country. By being in a position to take life but deciding not to do so, he makes a conscious choice to NOT shoot down a crippled American B-17.  While most of the zealots following Hitler demonstrated their inhumanity to their fellow man it should be noted when an exception arose among those in the German military. The author's research is exacting and in depth. The book is an exciting read and definitely a &#34;page turner&#34;.  For something in the same vein read what you can find about the White Rose Society, the young German students who defied Nazism and for their efforts were be-headed with piano wire. There were those who resisted the lunacy of Nazism.  They deserve to be remembered. (For what it's worth I am a retired history<br />teacher.)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is fun. It's not extremely difficult, but not so easy it's boring. Just waiting for more levels now.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Not only protects my Kindle from drop damage it sets up the screen to easily view screen. Buy one - trust me.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It only loads correctly about 25% of the time - usually takes me four or five tries to actually start playing. And often, as soon as I clear a room, the app just stops, and I have to restart it again. If it will start. It gets frustrating.
0525952926|5.0|I am sorry that I am almost done with, it is a great book. Right on par with Fall of Giants, if not better.
0786958731|4.0|I got this as a present for my boyfriend and so far so good! I had it on my wish list for some time waiting for the price to drop. But when the timing was right, I purchased it and it was much cheaper than the other ones in-stores.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Very similar to the books, entertaining and typical portrayal of Jack Reacher from the books by Lee Child. Of course the books are always better than the movies because of the detail.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|I love the movie and the soundtrack is great.  Some of the songs are re-recorded, more professional tracks (such as the one with the auditions).
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like it better then the app that comes with it. Get it and if you don't like it its free so what.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey allows its audience to escape to a time and place where life was simpler, more respectful, and drastically more elegant. This was definite the FEEL EVERYTHING season. I never thought I'd be a British drama fan, but this show makes me want to live in that time.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|this accessory is awesome, works fine with GoPro Hero 3, I don´t need anymore iPhone app or table app GoPro. this is touch-screen, realtime view (no delay) and you can see what you recorded!
0553103547|5.0|I came to read this book because I've become a fan of the TV series Game of Thrones and decided I'd like to learn more about these characters (and to also not run into any more BIG surprises...). While the writing is very tedious at times, the story and characters are so compelling and interesting. Martin's fiction is always unpredictable and always a challenge to keep up with. I have never been a fan of the Lord of the RIngs trilogy because of how overly descriptive and tiresome Tolkien's prose is, but Martin has created a world I WANT to know every little detail about. I can't wait to get through the rest of the series!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome it lets you jump  youre horses and groom your horses and give them treats cool hah
B00D37UQ1K|2.0|Just not a very good movie. Not the worst ever, just not very good. There are some really good actors that give spot on performances but the script and editing kills it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever I love it it's like a better version of temple run her it I am surprised that is free get it ignore the bad reviews I definately recommend it to everyone.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The writing was a little rough, but the story and message was great because it was written by someone who participated in the historical event.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The best of India and England... Good movie with an amazing cast and an inspiring story... Love the Indian lanscape!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I absolutely loved this book.  Sort of scary but really well written! Just an awesome awesome awesome book!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Lovely presentation for such an amazing trilogy, a lot of good extras... The three movies are masterpieces, especially the last one.
B002SKZBQS|4.0|I liked the story, but it was predictable.  The character had a warped view of his life.  Well, that is Stephen King.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Is a movie good for the soul, leaves you with a sense of hope... Great dialogs, lovely caracters and such a good actors.<br />You must see it!
0316228532|5.0|There are a lot of mixed reviews about this book, so I wasn't really sure what to expect when I started reading. This is first adult novel by J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books. It was quite the detour from those books, so I think lots of the readers when into it assuming it might have a hint of HP in there, and I think the Amazon reviews show this (around 800 for each of the stars). I've read a lot of witty, British novels, and compared to those this was a pretty good book.<br /><br />Based in a quiet, pretty, little English town, a member of the parish council suddenly dies, and the town is left to battle out who will take his spot. This novel is heavy with characters, and thought I often got confused as to who was who, Rowling writes incredibly strong personalities, creating a very believable dramatic plot line.<br /><br />It's a big book, and I struggled through some of it, but over all enjoyed it. I think this shows the breadth of styles in which Rowling can write, so it will be interesting to see if she writes another book in this genre, or something else entirely.<br /><br />I would suggest this for fans of Sophie Kinsella novels, Gone Girl, and Bridget Jone's Diary.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Is one of the best NKOTB albums... Great songs, especially the first single &#34;Remix&#34; and &#34;Jealous&#34;, sounds fresh, but with the group style...
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Tom is just as polished as ever. A great mix of rock n country with a little Cinderella and Aerosmith mixed in too. Money well spent!!
B003L77GG0|5.0|Finally Clark becomes Superman! Exciting season, sometimes unexpected, with a lot of action, suspense and romance. The last scene is amazing...
B00BEXB18M|5.0|One of his best albums in years. Nothing will ever compare to Rust In Peace but he definitely showed he is still as driven as ever. I listen to every song without bouncing around from one track to next. Great album!!!
B0091VYN70|5.0|great movie. very realistic. the plot keeps your attention. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes edward norton.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Picked up right where they left off. One of their best albums in my opinion very well written lyrics and great guitar work. A must for all Sabbath fans!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was such an enjoyable book to read.  Told from a guy's viewpoint, it really is laugh out loud funny in places. I will definitely be looking for the next book in the series.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|I saw this film on television earlier this year, albeit cut by time and language.  I enjoyed the magical storyline interesting along with characters of their own blend of humor and dramatic flair.  An excellent cast to be sure.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game to play with kids gives them good problem solving skills. We worked to together to solve each level.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Hi<br />I still have to read the last book in the series but I liked the first two.<br />I must say I was a little dissipointed after all the hipe of the books. I expected a mind blowing read but<br />it was more or less what I have expected. Maybe it was because everybody spoke so much about the<br />books before I read it. I still enjoued it very much and will recommend it to other readers.<br />Joanne
0307742997|3.0|This is my first book read from this author. It was a quick read and there were a few twists although a couple were a bit far fetched. My biggest gripe is as another reviewer stated, he gives away the killer halfway through the book with a pretty obvious clue. I think I would have rated the book higher if this wasn't the case.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Quite an opportunity to share the last work of Michael Jackson! The gentleness that he shared with his cast and crew was a joy to see. Michael, you are missed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|in this game you have to try to find your way through different rooms as each levels get more challenging. really fun.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Entwined with You is similar to the other book in the way of the couple always fighting and &#34;making up.&#34; Still enjoyable, I recommend it!
B005HSL626|2.0|This app is okay but it gets boring very quickly, it doesn't even keep my toddler's attention very long...at all
B002E0JL86|4.0|I really enjoyed Robin Williams in this film! I wanted to give it 5 stars, but it had just a tad too much language and slight nudity for my taste. Apart from that, it was a very warm movie for the family!
0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle was a stellar individual and I greatly appreciate what he did for our country.  Chris, I salute you and the sacrifices that you made for us.<br /><br />The story presented in this book is amazing and should be made into a movie. Fantastic book.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|I loved the actors, as usual in BBC productions, especially Richard Armitage, I fell in love with those expressive eyes;  Daniella Denby-Ashe was wonderful as the independent fiery Margaret
0345529057|5.0|What can I say...I watched season one on HBO. I could not wait for season two, so I bought the books.<br /><br />Very entertaining...wonderful series...I just hope that HBO chooses not to follow George Martin's storyline as presented in books 4 & 5...<br /><br />The author's approach to continuing this fantastic tale in books 4 & 5 was an experiment that proved to be faulty and detracted from the tale that he wanted to tell. I'm hoping that it was a lesson learned....
B00CGPPMKU|2.0|I didn't actually get this app, but it looked really cool and was in the free section BUT it's not free...is there something wrong with Amazon???
B008MG1E4A|5.0|So many seal books out there but this one is one of the best! Utmost respect to these men and I hope we honor these men everyday.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Keep the Kleenex handy! A tragic story, but you continue to turn the pages to learn what happens next. The horror of the Holocaust should never be forgotten.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I bought this because I just decided to try my hand at professional photography for the first time after years of doing videography. Being a total novice at photography (I always used my phone and point-and-shot camera to take photos), I decided to go pro and get this external camera flash! Best choice I ever made! This is so powerful, it can light up background many feet away even in sheer darkness! I've used this for professional wedding photography and flash was so great, I had the light settings only on -0.3 and that was bright enough! You won't be disappointed with this flash.<br /><br />It automatically works with your camera once its in the hot-shoe.<br />I chose this rating because as this is my first camera flash and being totally new at it (I must say its really easy to use; I didn't even read the instructions. I just took it right out of the box and started using it!<br />Nothing I didn't like about it.<br />I'd recommend this camera flash to beginner, amateur and professional alike! (If you're a professional, and have more money, go with a more expensive one, but if cost is your factor, go with this flash.) You won't be disappointed!
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is amazing.  Nothing that I expected it to be. Great story and even better ending. I would recommend this book to any adult who enjoys a truely romantic novel.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|A good yarn with many twists and turns.<br />A great  finish to the trilogy.<br />Not bad when you consider it was originally written in Swedish
B004A8EI9M|5.0|When I heard people saying there was a great TV series that had to do with zombies I had my doubts. I thought it was going to be a little silly and therefore it took a long time for me to come back and decide to give it a shot. I was sorely mistaken, since once I started watching the first episode I was instantly hooked. There is nothing silly about this series, the story is cleverly crafted, there is suspense / horror for days and some of the plot twists will leave you breathless.<br /><br />This is a short first season, so you can go through it in a day, but luckily the following seasons are longer (13 and 16 episodes for seasons 2 and 3 respectively). The creators do a great job with posing questions and slowly giving us information getting us closer and closer to the answer. For example, we instantly start to wonder about what caused the zombie a.k.a. \\"walker\\" outbreak? Also, what are the exact mechanics by which contagion works? and why walkers have to be killed a certain way.<br /><br />Beside the great story line, there are some excellent performances in this series. I particularly like the job Jon Berthal, who plays an intense Shane, who was a police officer until the outbreak and who after everything changed rebuilt his world only to see things shift again drastically. Jon can communicate quite a bit with his eyes, and this is used quite a bit in the series. Norman Reedus is my other favorite actor in this series, he plays a redneck that has some handy abilities when shooting arrows and may also have a softer side in there somewhere.<br /><br />My advice if you have not given this a try yet is to hurry up and do it already. Don't be like me. Once you start you will be watching these non-stop until you run out of episodes. Yes, the series is that good!
B0091REZMW|2.0|This game is constantly pestering me to connect to Facebook and Twitter... I had no idea it was a social media dependent game.  Otherwise. Great graphics and a fair way to spend your time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|No other game has compared to My Horse.  I enjoy all of the different tasks I required to keep the houses healthy.  There is a section you go to to check out others' stables and you can send gifts to others. Also, receiving gifts from other horse owners is fun.  Competing with other horses is my favorite activity.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome. App. I have never had any problems with it. It is easy to use and if you did have a question they have simple instructions.
B00CI21EBC|5.0|I first heard The Brand New Heavies in the 1990's, and have been a fan ever since.  This album has great songs similar to the 90's songs that were heard and sung.  I just wish that Ndea Davenport had more than 3 leads.  Her voice is much stronger than the other lead singer on a few other songs.  If they make another album please go back to your Ndea Davenport.  She is who helped put you on the US map...but Forever a fan.

B0061QD88S|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my 4 year old grand-daughter.  You can't go wrong buying Disney movies, and the old ones are better than the new ones.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|I loved this movie. Not for young kids, this was made for adults. Animation is top notch, the acting is wonderful, and the story is very well told.<br /><br />Marvel needs to take notes on how to make a great comic book movie. Alto they seem to have a few good ones, DC has many more that is done right.

B00C391Y3I|5.0|the priest sound as good as ever on this dvd, the picture quality is stunning and sounds fantastic, new guitarist ritchie faulkner ably fills the obvious big shoes of kk downing admirably which to me was the biggest surprise, the other members are their usual stellar selves, all in all a fantastic performance!
B00C81LYH2|4.0|I have collected dolls my whole life. I have the original Barbie, Skipper and Scooter. Untill now had not added any more Barbies but this beauty caught my eye. I peeked in the box she has white shoes and a doll stand but I plan to keep her in the box. She even has earrings and I find her face prettier than some others. She has very thick full rooted hair very blonde. Her arm is in a fixed bent position which looks nice in the box. A child could play with her but being the 25th anniversary edition I think its best kept as a keepsake or buy two. I took off one point as I don't find the seams down the front of the arms attractive.  She does have on holiday red nail polish, nice touch.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|interesting puzzles. l liked that there were no instructions or hints.  wish for more levels. could vary the types of puzzles - word puzzles?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was very excited to see the third book released! And I loved it and hope the fourth comes out faster than this one ! Highly recommended-Great series!!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time.  This movie is funny, witty, great music, and has fantastic cast.  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed this game. Well organized and sophisticated puzzles. For those who love to solve puzzles, you will be amazed.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great action movie with great actors! Action, romance, great acting- what's not to like! I can't wait to see the sequel.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Always a great movie no matter how many times you watch it ! A true love story and great soundtrack too
1400032717|5.0|This book is entertaining and insightful. You will laugh out loud!  It's the story of a young lad with Aspergers Syndrome...but funny.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|If you've ever seen the video of the song, &#34;Lightning&#34; from this album, you know that Eric Church is one of the rising stars of all the current country music singer/songwriters.  I dare you to watch and listen and not get choked up.  What an amazing talent this guy is!!  Can't wait to hear the whole album.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|This is the only way I can 'sneak up' on a picture or video of my dog Zoe. She starts to 'duck and run' the instant she hears a camera (or anything else that makes a small noise) start up.

B0084I2PEO|5.0|A surprising heartbreaking realistic replica of the meaning of been a women in this world full of challenges, socially and historically ruled by the law of men. Full of complicity, resilence, comitment, friendship and love.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My grandaughter wanted this.  She loves it.  Large pix are easy to change and move around.  Variety keeps her happy playing.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This is the second book I have read from this author in just as many days! I am impressed with his work and this book was more fun to read than I anticipated! Great dialogue and well plotted, and love the Bond like adventure! Hats off to the author. Would love to see this as a movie. I anxiously await your next book!
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Great story and great acting.We need more like this one. Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock give us almost two hours of real enjoyment.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy has to be one of Kanye West's best albums. Although he drifts away from his previous 4 albums, one still sees that he brings aspects of 808s and Graduation into the mix. The album is darker though, focusing on love and paparazzi and same old Kanye lyricism. The beats, however, don't let you down at all, just like in every Kanye album. Overall, you won't be disappointed. Also, the deluxe edition DVD of Runaway is pretty well made, the story line is touching, and the songs used are the same ones from the album.
0812550706|5.0|Both my son and I read this book and loved it.  It is a great read.  yee haw/  two more words/

B0012DP8A6|1.0|The movie itself is great, but unfortunately my copy &#34;stopped, started, skipped around , froze up etc&#34; In all my years dealing with Amazon, this is the first complaint I've ever had to make. At 80 years old, I love shopping at Amazon. It's a true blessing so I must overlook this one disappointment.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I THINK IT'S THE BEST BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE HOW PEOPLE AND FAMILY ARE DOING. ALSO KEEP IN TOUCH  WITH THEM.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Relaxing and fun with appealing graphics and sound. I have this version on my Kindle Fire and can play it just about anywhere.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I don't watch romance films, I'll start with that. When I first saw the previews for Silver Linings Playbook however I knew this was a film I had to see, and I was spot on. This is one of the best films of all time, the acting superb and the cinematography is perfect. I cannot recommend this film too highly.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|While there's some departure from the original novel here, the insertions and additions work very well and, I dark say, even make it better in certain respects. The set design, special effects, and all the rest are stupefying, on par with STAR WARS or any other first tier science fiction film. Yet, JOHN CARTER does not rely on simple wows to carry it: The storyline and script are equally well-done. This film also portrays alien life forms as well or better than any other production that I've seen. You don't have to completely understand the mythos behind the novel to enjoy this film, and the various Classical, Biblical, and mythological allusions add something to the story.<br /><br />Quite a miscellany of cast: Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, and, perhaps most of all, Willem Dafoe as an 8-foot-tall, 4-armed Martian (!) all play their parts very well. The start-to-finish narration that takes the audience by the hand, relating every detail and event (right up to the Disney logo) is a device that would usually be ruinous, but it's both helpful and humorous, adding another quirky appeal to JOHN CARTER. Only a Disney film with Colin Wilson on its production team could produce something so memorable.<br /><br />Incredible!'nuff said!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Very challenging if you go past one suit! Play is very fast thanks to quick coding.<br />Good app - andthe price is right.
0307346617|5.0|This is a great book. As a big fan of the zombie story line this is one of the best that I have read.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Love the story line. I think it may be better than the 50 shades series. Looking forward to the next book!!!
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Good movie but when compare to the other die hard, it was not as good the story line and the action seem generic.

006117758X|5.0|This coming-of-age book is incredibly dark, probably little too much for most people to let it hang in their stomach.  But it's now one of my favorite books ever.  People speculate that the title is a parody on `Catcher in the Rye', which gets all the love from the literary world.  I was already an adult when I read Catcher, and I am not that impressed by a musing of a jaded child (it's still a great book, just not sure if it's deserving of such praise).  The adult hypocrisy, and the phoniness of the world, can be much, much darker than that.  And Ham captures a raw version of it.  In later interview, Bukowski said that being beaten as a child helped his writing because he understood undeserved pain.  If you understand undeserved pain, you will appreciate this novel.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game!!! I used to play Angry Birds but this game uses much less of my phone battery!

B00CWVGBEO|4.0|we enjoyed it. i thought it might be a bit over the top and too corny but it was actually well executed, funny and overall entertaining. Good action, great cast, cute storyline. Will probably add to our movie library.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I'm new to the game itself but  for those who tried downloading multiple times those files were partially saved incomplete so you might need to delete those files before you try getting it again. Try using es folder explorer to locate the files it helped me
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins has done it again!!! The latest Sigma Force adventure from New York Times Best Selling author James Rollins is everything we've come to expect and more! There is more science, more adventure, and just a little more romance. This is, I believe, the best yet. If  you've never read Mr. Rollins, then by all means start now! His Sigma Force series is a fun, thought-provoking roller coaster ride through history into the realms of cutting edge science. The Eye of God is an amazing story that will get you thinking and questioning everything you see! I am more than ready for the next installment, and I've just finished this one!
B003TJR2HS|4.0|I have an older pioneer deck in my car.  Been using my old iPod nano with 30 pin iPod cable to play music in my car with no problem.  When the old faithful iPod gave out, I upgraded to the most recent gen ipod with lightning port. Figured all I needed was the 30 pin to lightning adapter and I would be good, right? Not so much. Apparently good old Apple has been up to its old tricks. Something changed that doesn't allow it to charge while plugged into my car like the old one did. Which, besides the time i spend loading music to it, was the only way i charged it.  Since i commute pretty far, the charging was essential.  I would have returned the new iPod had I not thrown away the receipt for the adapter.  Long story even longer, this cablejive product along with the iPod 30 pin to lighting adapter has me listening to music in my car like I used to, while charging my iPod.<br /><br />One reason I didn't give it 5 stars. When the iPod is in my car with the car turned off, there is a slight drain. So over the weekend the iPod gets completely drained. When I start the car, my old iPod would start right up even though drained, since it was getting juice. Even though the new setup still charges, it requires that I unplug and replug the iPod to get my stereo to acknowledge it.
B001OI6YJI|3.0|The story has potential-- the idea that a robot would utilize uncorrupted fetal brain tissue that would be programmed through a bio-mechanical &#34;mind-meld&#34; is interesting; this scenario being further twisted by the theft & programming of said robot by a mentally unbalanced space-ace (played by a young Harvey Keitel) adds to the appeal.<br />The special effects hold up fairly well, also. Sadly, the biggest disappointment is not the storyline, but the completely flat performances put forth by the main actors-- Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett-- who are paired as couple, which considering their age difference comes off as creepy-awkward.<br />Watch it once for nostalgia-- it's fun see Keitel so young, and the psychotic robot is pretty neat, too.
B0053O89KG|5.0|The characters in this series are so perfectly matched. (casting is great)<br />I have always been a big fan of Nathan Fillion and he never disappoints.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|I love this movie and I already have a copy of it !  Say waaa ?  I ordered &#34;My Science Project&#34; for my step-son and his son who is named &#34;Harlan&#34; ... like the character in the movie.  There are two other DVD I ordered that I already have ... for the same purpose.  I tried to buy them and have Amazon ship them to him but that got messed up and dropped.  So, I put all three into a cushioned box and I'LL SHIP THEM.  That way I know what's what and they will get the movies.  The other two DVD's are &#34;Real Genius&#34; and &#34;Top Secret&#34; ... both with Val Kilmer.  I RECOMMEND ALL THREE as really FUN MOVIES !
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game. I wish it was longer. I hope they come out with new levels soon.<br />I like that it wasn't to hard or to easy.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I downloaded on a Kindle Fire HD, and it works just fine! Whenever I wanna talk to my friends, I can kik them! Awesome app! Glad I downloaded! :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game.<br />It was  a good experience  and helped prime my brain for problem solving and hard thinking in school.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Was fun and challenging, but don't like that you only get 10 levels... kinda sucks, have to wait for more at some later date. Glad I got it free.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I love it!!! I searched for it in the target stores 3 different times and they were sold out!!! My favorite song is madness!!!!!!!!! I ordered this and like got it a couple days later, thank-you sooooo much!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wife got me hooked on the game and I been playing around with this game for months ans the Paris theme is cool too.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|You can't go wrong with such an epic band and their debut album - this one changed my life! As a wee teen of 12 I stumbled upon &#34;Even Flow&#34; and a whole world of rock and grunge was opened up for me. Just amazing music.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Fun game, but it won't let me log into Facebook. I have tried deleting the app, logging out of Facebook, I  tried multiple times. If this could be fixed that would be awesome!
B0012IWHDW|5.0|I am very happy that some of Bob Dylans classics and early Cds are still available and of good quality sound.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a really fun and addicting game. Once you master it you won't be able to put it down. I love it and so does everyone else that I show it to.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well written and exciting from the very first chapter.  Had so much going on that it had you trying to figure it out before getting to the end.<br /><br />Kept my interested throughout and wanting more at the end
B00594XOZU|4.0|This is a really fun wake to make friends and talk to new people for instance me and my friend talk to each other she just gabe me her name and i searched it and now were friends.You should totally get it!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|If you're the type of person that reads the book, then watches the movie, you're going to be sadly disappointed with this movie. The basic of the basics of the book's storyline is correct in this movie.  Yes, the Lena is a Castor, yes, Ethan is an ordinary boy that doesn't truly fit in.  They do fall in love, and Lena has until her 16th birthday to be normal until she gets Claimed.  She does move in to town to live with her uncle, and the townspeople do shun her.... After those facts, the story gets changed dramatically.  They change the character's roles and relationships, they take out characters entirely.... They even change how the story ends!  Which is unfortunate as quite a few of the actors in this film are some of my favorites.  And visually, the movie was entertaining.<br /><br />If, however, you are not that type of person, then the movie is good.  There are still plot holes, but without reading the book, you can't really notice them unless you really pay attention.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is like regular youtube execept some thing are not downloaded to a kindle fire yet so its hard to look for things you want. Other than that it is amazing!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|portable mtg.  perfect. just like the Pc version! draft mode is a welcome addition too, building decks is amazing and addictive.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|This is a good cheat app where you can cheat you can play this on Facebook or some devices , but it sucks because on the Kindle Fire HD it doesn't even have candy crush and the pictures sometimes gets blurry too if I were you I rather not get this app that much in lease is free
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Using this ap on a Kindle Fire. So far, this ap seems to be truly free with no annoying ads or anything.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Excellent!  We have seen this over and over. The music is wonderful and the acting, in our opinion, is very good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game and i would toattally rate this as a 5 star game, my favorit e part about this game is the compotitions but i just wish there was even more to the game like breeding the horses of being able to just ride them around. i also think that it would be fun to exersise them yourself. it is a really fun game and i would recomend it to all horse lovers.
B008220C38|2.0|I did not care for the format of this movie. I have seen it before in another style on Masterpiece Theater. This one just was not up to par.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very good game. Well done and makes you think. Good for a brain exercise though I did finish in one night I will likely play again.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|More in the Bag of Bones category than his horror stories. Thoroughly enjoyable, really draws you in. He's at his best ever in character development - more efficient than in his earlier novels, and even more effective.
0345529057|5.0|Does this product really need to be review like really! If you love the show and like reading the books will be even better.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|This is a wonderful film that entertains, excites, and has a happy ending. The characters look so lifelike that you forget that this a computer generated film. It has everything in it that makes for a good story. A most enjoyable evening watching Steven Spielberg's creative genius.
B00109T5WY|5.0|A beautifully shaped journey, I have listened to this constantly since purchasing. It deserves much better speakers than I possess.  Highly recommended.
B00AFEX83C|3.0|Monsters Inc. is a great family film and a fun time at the movies.  However, it could have been much better in my opinion.  On its own it is a good film to take your children to, but by Pixar standards I find the film to very average.  I have seen Pixar at their best with the Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Wall-E, and the Toy Story trilogy.  Compared to those films, in my humble opinion, this film does not measure up.<br /><br />The thing that I liked the best about this film is the concept.  The concept is that the monster world is powered by scream energy.  Monsters use manufactured doors as windows to the human world and scare children which give the monsters their energy.  I find that a great concept.  I also like that scaring is more of a business and it has this corporate aspect.  The concept itself is not new, but this film does give its own spin on it.  There is a lot that they could do with such a good set-up.<br /><br />However, what they ultimately do with it is underwhelming.  One of the big issues I have with this film is the story.  The story is very cliché and not very interesting.  The story is that a little human girl comes into the monster world and our heroes Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sullivan (John Goodman) have to protect her from the villains and get her back to the human world.  Along the way the girl and our heroes (particularly Sullivan) form a bond and realize that humans are not so evil.  I have seen this story before, and I knew what was going to happen ultimately.<br /><br />The villains were not that interesting either.  The villain Randall (Steve Buscemi) I found to be more annoying than threatening.  He is just a one-dimensional bad guy.  I did not feel much tension or urgency regarding their ultimate goal.  The final showdown at the end was, to be honest, kind of boring.  It was not that exciting to me and I felt no tension.  The last act of Monsters University I thought was done much better.  In fact I thought Monsters University as a whole was better than this film despite that film being quite cliché as well.  I just found it more enjoyable.<br /><br />There are many good things about the film.  I did like Mike and Sullivan.  I found that they did have chemistry together and they can be quite funny, especially Mike.  The humor is fine, but not Pixar's best.  I found that the funniest parts were during the third act.  The kids should be very entertained.  The animation is great and it still holds up today.  I did not see it in 3D when it came out last year so I cannot comment on that.  As I mentioned earlier I do really like the concept.<br /><br />Overall, most people will really enjoy this movie.  The reason why I am being hard on it is because I thought it was average by Pixar standards.  I have seen Pixar at its greatest and this was not their greatest.  However, you should still enjoy yourself.  The children should love it.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|my daughter had this C.D. and misplaced it so she was very happy to get it for Xmas.  she loves Alecia Keys and went to see her in concert 3 x in a row and brought someone different each time who also loves her.  What's there not to love????.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I was a little disappointed that this is basically the sounds from the movie clipped and put on a CD, but in listening to this and the full motion picture soundtrack, apparently both are like that. All the songs I wanted were on this version, the sound quality is good, and I loved having the digital copy while I waited for the physical disc.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|every time a new one comes out I get it.  she never dissappoints me.  I could listen to her sing all day. And I do sometimes.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|surprisingly great, I read the book and loved the story. I didn't think it could be turned  into a movie.  A good deal of the  story  takes place inside the host.  The screen play accomplished the task quite well.
B00127RAJY|5.0|definately kicks your butt at first (actually literally it does as you go along..), but a great work out all in all.
B007NUP6CM|5.0|dance mix, same 2 songs on this disc. good remix of each though.<br />I like to hear it loud and clear on the magic sound system that kills!
B00992CF6W|4.0|i love this game but amazon is yoo over priced... if they want good money they should make this free for the people that cant afford it or that dont have a creditcard... Still a great game!!
B008B68IUY|4.0|My daughter has wanted Draculaura's car for over a year now, yet she always ends up getting a new Monster High doll instead for one reason or another. We hadn't seen the Scaris convertible in stores, but when I showed her a picture of it on here, she quickly decided that she wanted this one too. Luckily for us, I managed to get one, and she's been very happy with it. Any Monster High fan out there who wants something for their dolls to look even cooler with, the Scaris car definitely gets the job done.<br /><br />The convertible is surprisingly big, made of a pretty durable plastic and can seat up to 4 Monster High dolls. Two in the front and two in the back \\"seat\\". Pop open the trunk and you can store a couple of accessories in there. Everything works like it should, like the seat belts easily being pulled out to get dolls in the seats, as well as the steering wheel and stick shift. The car's design is pretty dang sweet, with cobweb-like patterns all over it, and dog heads on the back lights. There's even a 'Scaris' license plate. While there isn't much variety in the colors, they did make sure to add some little MH details like the steering wheel and stick shift fitting the theme. Check out the rims too- I can just see my daughter wanting those for her car in 10 years when she starts driving...<br /><br />No accessories of any kind are included with this car, and there aren't any special light up or sound features either. On the plus side, this means no having to replace batteries when the features stop working, though it would have been nice for them to include something, even if it's just the headlights or a horn sound feature. You push the car forward and back to make it go, with no pull-back action of any sort. It's a pretty basic car.<br /><br />There are a few reasons why I give the car four stars: the price, the very limited trunk space, a slight safety concern (in theory, nothing hazardous to kids) and the lack of doors. The price, even when buying directly from Amazon, is a few bucks more than I think it's worth. You're getting a basic car with nothing extra. No stickers, not even a single solitary accessory like a booklet that most of the dolls come with! A little photo album with the MH girls touring Scaris would have been a pretty cool extra to throw in. Regarding the trunk...if you notice the gaps in the sides of the car, you'll see that there's QUITE a bit of extra room that could have been used by the trunk. This thing isn't even a half inch deep, and can only hold the smallest of MH accessories. Not that I'd suggest putting pets in a trunk, but even fitting say, Chewlian, isn't going to happen. Very lame. The lack of doors isn't that big of a deal, since the dolls can be placed into the car easily, but why -not- include doors that open and close?! As for that safety concern, that's why I have the educational value rating at 2 stars. You know how I said you can get two other dolls into the back \\"seat\\"? Well, said seat is actually on the trunk. Imagine flattening the back of a VW Beetle into a seat and slapping two seat belts on it so the passengers are sitting on the outside, exposed to traffic. Yeah, 'not really a good idea is it? I'm not going to write a letter to congress about getting this toy pulled from stores because of this or anything, but it makes me wonder what the heck they were thinking with this aspect of the design. I wonder if the car will ever make an appearance in the MH show or movies exactly as it appears in toy-form.<br /><br />If you can get the car for a few bucks off during a sale or something, more power to you. My daughter loves playing with it, which is priceless in my book, so I'm happy with it too. Hopefully with the next vehicles that come out, there'll be a little more to make it worth your money.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A free game you can really enjoy.  Also doesn't hit you up constantly to buy something. Kids love it too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is just right challenging but still playable. I would give this 5 stars if it had hints, but they are not necessary to enjoy the game.
B0057R5G6E|3.0|The sculpture and extras are what I'd expect, the set arrived with the Digital Copy past the expiration date.<br />Was not obvious in the offer that digital copy was non-functional. As I have likely let some other digital copies expire by my lack of need to make these copies, it is not a big issue. I just do not like being suprised like this.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I love this app. I used it to hang a group of pictures and it made it a breeze. I work in construction and I use it everyday.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I've never seen a DVD included with a CD. It is generous and unexpected - like the Piano Guys themselves.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Excellent mix of suspense, science, history and lingual stretch to make this book and it's characters come full circle with the reader. If you do not want your average read, I highly recommend this series.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|I really like this show.  I started watching it on my local PBS station when my Tv froze and I had to see the end so badly I actually paid to see it.  I would love to see more, but at $2 per episode? No thanks.
0375850864|5.0|My 9 year old daughter recently read this book and from her descriptions as she was reading it I quickly became interested in reading it myself.  She described it as mysterious, sometimes confusing, a book she couldn't put down.  After reading it, I completely agree!<br /><br />This is one of the best stories I've read in some time.  The characters are well developed.  The story is wonderfully told.  And the premise is attention grabbing: mysterious letters arrive in strange places and include information that is impossible to know.  Who is writing these?  Why are they writing them?  How do they know things that will happen in the future?  Why is the writing shaky?  Why is the author of these mysterious letters requesting the main character to write her complete story in a return letter?  The answers to these questions slowly unfold through the engaging story.<br /><br />From my recent experience with this book I can confidently state that kids and adults will enjoy it ... I guess that's why it won the Newbery prize a few years ago.  Not only is it a great read but it's fun to read a story with or near the same time as your child so you can talk about it together.  This one is sure to create some great conversation.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|Great game! I got the free app first, played it all the way through. Then purchased full app. I like winning every game. Makes it more fun.  No problems running it at all. Love it!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|you know if someone would have told me that this was the true story of Hansel and Gretel I may have believed it. the action in this movie was pretty good and it's very believable that these two are brother and sister. it was a very good movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just cant wait for more floors!  I loved the challenge and hated when I couldn't figure it out. _looking forward to more challenges
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a great game to pass the the time. It's very addicting, can't stop building my park and collecting new dinos.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I have a, large head , so I aint mad that 4 or 6 months into it the casing broke on the headband. But I gotta say excellent Teamspeak3 and gaming headset. Best deal I found in a while.
1451695195|2.0|THE CONCEPT IS GREAT...................HOWEVER,................I THINK MOST OF THE READERS WHO SAW THE TITLE WERE LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION...............NOT MEDICAL DETAILS...........ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE ER...............<br />I GET THE FACT YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH YOUR STORY AND CREDIBILITY................SOME OF THE MORE GROSS INFORMATIOIN WAS NOT NEEDED ....................I ALREADY BELIEVED THE AUTHOR!!!
B0053FANS6|5.0|Putting aside the quality of the movies, specially 2 and 3, this collection is a good effort from Universal and the price is inviting.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is amazing! A great way to pass the time and is fun. I love how you get to have different penguins. However, it a lot like temple run. Other than that it is a great game! Definitely worth it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A lot of action as well as suspense! Love the entire series and can't wait for the next book to come out this fall!
B007ZSBQYE|5.0|I like this game and the grand kids really like this game. it keeps them amused.  and occupied, great game.
B009NY43NY|3.0|This series started out with such a unique flair, a new vampire mythology that had something relevant to say about todays civic and social issues.  I think the author lost her way when she sold the story and the characters to HBO, her writing was never the same after that.  I love the HBO 'True Blood' too, but it's as if those fancy, screenwriters intimidated the authors in such a way as to disrupt her development of the main characters.  Ms Harris says she knew the ending of this series from the beginning and I'll take her word on that...but why drag it out so ineffectively for so long?  This last book in the series is lackluster, to say the least...but maybe that's the way Sookies life really was...kind of like the rest of us (we just do't like to admit it).
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|Finally found a note app that works. I like the ability to use either text or hand writing. And all lists are automatically saved upon exiting. Great for grocery and To-Do lists.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I hadn't read the original Bram Stoker in years...I had forgotten how prudish writing had to be in centuries past...I laughed at myself for not remembering the original story and the exquisite writing of Bram Stoker, who started it all!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I love the little twist at the end. While it was gory I never felt that it actually showed the gore, I feel the rating was more for what was implied rather than what was actually shown.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not to hard, but some good challenges.<br />Would like some more screens, with more puzzles.<br />Nice graphics. Enjoyed the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the story. It was so suspenseful and dramatic. The way true love mixed in with violence and  tragic events was amazing. Suzanne Collins  splashed in sadness where the story needed it. Look forward to reading the next hunger games book :-)
1439163154|4.0|For those giving Palo Alto horrible reviews: I don't think you seem to get the point.<br /><br />Franco wasn't trying to be the next Hemingway, Miller, Bukowski, Vonnegut etc. with his debut, Palo Alto Stories. He simply was trying to take an undeniably interesting (though not-so-original) premise of teen angst in a suburban setting (and told through different members of a certain group of \\"friends\\" in each story) and make it his own. And for that, I definitely would say he succeeds. The individual stories don't necessarily have a solidified beginning, middle and end... But, in reality, how many of our life stories truly do? Real life isn't that clean cut, and Franck tries to represent this, succeeding in putting the sometimes disgusting, sometimes beautiful, sometimes grotesque reality-based drama on the page.<br /><br />He might not be the most talented writer out there, but he legitimately presses us with each story to confront the reality of every kid he shines a light on. This was a solid effort, and being a voracious reader of Young Adult fiction, I can say that I truly enjoyed the book for it's display of teens trying to find their own way, growing up and growing older. I wouldn't recommend it to you get children, but definitely to kids in their mid to late teens. It's a good read, and an entertaining one at that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very good game. It is great for kids to learn about taking care of a horse and it is also great for entertainment purposes.<br />I like how the graphics are very detailed. I like how you can train your horse and take care of it as if it was real.<br />I don't like how many ads pop up and sometimes the gameplay but that is minor and very understandable because this IS a FREE game.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This album is one of those that you like from the begining to the end. I can't discard a song from it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. You get live radar and extended forecasts for any city you want and you can save multiple cities to quickly get the weather for anywhere you want. Also has severe weather alerts and it is so much easier than scrolling through websites. It has been very accurate too.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have never felt the need to write a book review before, but this book was so amazing that I wanted to tell the world. The author made you feel the characters. I felt their pain and their intense passionate love. It kept me guessing and I love that. It was also a very emotional book. I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say this is a must read. This is the first book that I read from this author and I was impressed.

0060899190|5.0|Such an intriguing book. The idea of reading other people's secrets, big or small, funny or serious, strange or common, is just so interesting to me. I loved this book and it lived up to all my expectations! I reccommend without reservations.

B002ZG99QS|5.0|Special effects candy-land with the exception of the Clu program and poor attempts to portray a younger digital Flynn. Story is again, as simple as the first movie and fine for the kids but the real sensory overload is the soundtrack by Daft Punk. Pure awesome sauce. I've been playing the full soundtrack for weeks and can't get enough of it. Pump up the volume and make sure there's plenty of base.

B004KPLVV8|4.0|Tron was considered ahead of it's time when it was released. I wouldn't call it WAY ahead, but it was pretty cutting-edge stuff at the time. Watching it again today filled me with nostalgia. Even though the effects were very dated and the story was simple and child-like, I enjoyed it's clean and family orientated innocence.<br /><br />With modern movies trying to shock us with blood, murder and all the other horrible things out there, today's youth will find this lame and kitchy. This movie is however, a pleasant return to fresh air.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game the rooms present a chalange but are not impossible to get out of. The only problem I had with the game is that there where only 10 floors in the game. I do however highly recommend this game.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Installed the app, downloaded the first three videos that I had my eye on within a few minutes.<br />No problems whatsoever. Flawless. This is a keeper.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|From the first few pages of reading this book i didn't want it to end. I loved getting lost in the magical world of Le Cirque des reves.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|My grandson mentioned this movie to me recently..thought we had it, didn't so not only ordered him his own, ordered a copy for myself...still a great watch
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|I'm not sure why or how but the blu-ray was cheaper than the DVD. So while it bothers me my collection is not all the same, I'm very pleased with this set. The boxing is gorgeous and the inside cover is really sad (10 is turned away from you). There are gorgeous photos and a little booklet giving a synopsis of each special. Fantastic set, fantastic price. All about around fantastic,
074358158X|4.0|Lisey is the widow of brilliant novelist Scott Landon.  It is two years after Scott's death and she has finally gotten up the courage to clean out his office studio.  The next few days will try her in ways she never imagined.  The mountains of papers and memorabilia begin to unlock memories that she has blocked out for many years.  Not only that, but her sister, Amanda, has fallen into a catatonic state and has to be committed.  And for good measure, throw in Jim Dooley, a crazed fan who wants Scott's un-published works for his very own.  If Lisey can get through this with mind and body still intact, it will be something of a miracle.<br /><br />Lisey's Story is one of Stephen King's most disturbing audiobooks.  Not scary; disturbing.  Beneath the surface I think Lisey's Story is about insanity and the different ways people cope with it, or attempt to fight it off.  Scott Landon was raised by an insane father and spent his entire life trying not to let that insanity catch up to him.  I'm still not sure if he was successful.  Lisey's sister Amanda deals with life by cutting herself and going catatonic from time to time.  And then there's Jim Dooley who uses a can-opener on Lisey to get what he wants.<br /><br />Mare Winningham is an actress who has been in notable movies such as \\"St. Elmo's Fire.\\"  She has also appeared in dozens of major television series dating all the way back to the mid 1970's.  Some of those include \\"Police Woman\\", \\"Starsky and Hutch\\", and more recently \\"CSI\\", \\"Cold Case\\", and \\"24.\\"  As with most trained actors and actresses, Mare Winningham makes a good audiobook reader.  I enjoyed her reading of Lisey's Story very much.<br /><br />Lisey's Story is a good audiobook, although as I said, a little disturbing.  As with many of Stephen King's more recent novels, this one delves deeply into the human psychosis.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IZ THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED ONE<br />G THIS IS AWESOME!!!!! !!!!!!<br /> If u don't have it u need to get it!!!
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Linguistic to survives in literature is the house I am This game is hard but I thought it got a lot more fundamental rights of law and a free agent market for the house I got a
1781162646|5.0|King showing he can excel at much, much more than horror and gross-out novels. Here, he is at his very best storytelling. Dev Jones is the perfect protagonist. And the array of characters and the environment Stephen King creates makes you feel that you've been to Heaven's Bay and talked with most of the people there. Its mostly a coming-of-age story with a dash of ghosts and a pinch of a murder mystery. Mixed together in one of the best stories I've read in a while.
B005UD1D62|5.0|A great, easy, girly read! I hope Lauren writes some more books!<br /><br />I highly recommend it! I read them all so quick!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and entertaining game.  Guaranteed to keep you coming back for more.  My daughter loves this game and was through the first ten levels in no time.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the best slender man game on the market. There should be a couple more maps though, and you should be able  play w/ other people, too. All in all totally worth a dollar. Buy it. Slendy is watching.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I like that there is a storyline that carries from episode to episode and also a storyline that gets resolved during each episode. Great to watch as a marathon. It transitions very smoothly.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Game ok. Need to have more free star's and it gets harder to play and win with higher lvl players
0385349947|5.0|We purchased this book for all the women in our company, then decided to include all the men for required reading.  It is now a book included in our orientation packet.  Awesome.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just love this game it is very fun and interesting. I have a great time playing this game. I hope they make a series.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|The trilogy was outstanding,fast paced&well developed.the characters were believable and also well developed,real places and times gave a great feel to the story
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game and probably liked it as much because it wasn't incredibly difficult. Definitely enough to keep me challenged, but not impossible.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|so damn cool you must be a fool. I have to admit that they have been able to kick me in the ass.
0030565812|1.0|I was so disappointed to receive this book and find out that this is an abridged version.  I have never needed to return anything to Amazon before, so I don't even know if it's possible, but I will be looking into it.  That is the kind of information that should be included in the product description.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Claire Danes is outstanding in this excellent movie. It provides insight into the autism spectrum and Temple Grandin's unique way of seeing the workd
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I got into this because of my 17 year old granddaughter. Now we have more things to talk about as I need her to fill in information that I don't know. She is in the current season - and I am only making my was through Season 1!
0783240236|5.0|This film is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It is filled with action and suspense.  I enjoyed the special effects and camera angles from the bird's point of view.  It was great fun watching the special features about how the movie was made.  Look for a cameo appearance of Alfred Hitchcock in the very beginning of the movie.  I am glad to have this movie as part of my collection.
B003NS2T9G|4.0|Love the characters and the way they interact with each other. Great story lines. Always keeps me interested in what will happen next.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I had already seen Season 1 of Downton Abbey and couldn't wait to see Season 2.  That is why I ordered it from Amazon. Now, I will be watching Season 3 which I rented from the library.  All the actors are wonderful in this program.  The story and the costuming are both so realistic from that era.  The contrast between the wealthy and their servants and the relationships between the two are especially fascinating to me. Can't wait for Season 4 which will start in January.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The price was better on here so of course I picked it up. It's exactly what I wanted. if you own a PS3 at this point and you don't know what to expect from a controller, I don't know what I could possibly put here that would change your mind.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|this game is amazing I can not believe that I hadn't heard of it before! awesome graphics and gameplay! multiple weapons and zombies, saving up for the world war 2 zombie pack
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this is a pretty cool game.  the game play is awesome and I can play for hours on end.  I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys the w.o.w. type of experience.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Would recommend this book to everyone. It's very easy reading. Once you start reading book you will have a haard time putting it down.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Lots of twists, turns and reveal-ations in the book! Great page turner and the reader can't wait to see what happens next!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was fun and challenging... made me think. I would have enjoyed more levels though. Looking forward to some updates and more levels.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|A beautiful read. Purchased all after reading this. Character driven and great story line. Recommend to those who want to read just to relax and and escape into a story.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this bag. It was exactly as described. Would recommend it for anybody looking for a backpack type bag for their camera. There is plenty of room inside this bag and its very comfortable to wear.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|There's potential for the app, however with only \\"medium\\" quality and no search feature, it leaves much to be desired. Twitch has said they're working on it but the last update was in May, I believe. Hopefully it will improve given time.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this movie!! Its so well done couldn't have asked for more! I am a big fan of the Alien series and all the movies provide just a pinch of background history about who and what these aliens might be and be from. This movie finally gets around to answering some of those questions but in a new fresh way. Its scary at times, its action packed, the actors are all amazing, and there are so many little details with meaning that I have watched this movie 5 times and still see something new each time. Leaves you wanting more!! Can't wait till the next movie comes out :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a really fun game  it gets hard once or twice but other wise it's ok/easy I would recommend this game to anyone who likes escape a room
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is really fun.You get to rescue animals and nurse them back to health.Once you get a family of 4 you can realease them back to the wild.The only thing is that you kinda do the same thing over again.Other than that it is quite fun.I highly recommend getting this app!  A-D
B00D6GT5S8|3.0|I love the tempo of the songs but I just wish I understood the language so I can feel the completeness of a songs vibe.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome! the only thing I do not like is that you only a limited space. but the amount of sugarcane makes up for it.
0140557741|5.0|I use this book with several classes I teach - adults and children.  Makes you think about perspective and this concept can be incorporated into most disciplines.  I have seen it used in the traditional (science, history...) classroom and also vocational classes (construction, nursing...).  There are just so many great uses.
B00A83075M|5.0|Our nephew saw this at camp and wanted it for his birthday. He loves it and repeats a lot of the dialogue! His mom approved of the purchase.
B003ZMF26W|3.0|I'm on my second CM Storm Inferno Gaming Mouse. The first one malfunctioned where the left click button got stuck in the &#34;down&#34; position when used quite frequently. That said, I love how it feels in my hand, and I love the accessibility of all the buttons. Since I do love the ergonomics of it, I bought a second one and so far so good.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I've ordered four of these in the past two years.  Great design but sound eventually goes out in one ear.  The price used to be very reasonable compared to the alternatives.  Looks like Sony just increased the price.  Not sure if they started to use better materials now with the higher price.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|I live in Jersey, Channel Islands, UK, but for some reason we do not exist (weather wise) for this app.......RUBBISH
141694737X|5.0|i remember reading this book as a kid and was so happy to find it for my own kids. they think it is hilarious and my 2 year really loves opening a flap on every page.
030758836X|2.0|Nowhere near as good as all the hype. Ending is a cop out. Feel a bit cheated. Would not recommend.
B00BWDJILG|5.0|Good CD THANKS love REDMAN music  anything he does is great. I recommend his work to those that like his style!!!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|this game you cant put the girls hair so I deleted it and you mostly have to unlock everything also you cut all of her hair
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Surreal, and had a dreamlike quality.  Strong woman, protecting a small boy, who had so many questions about his life.
B0059WTMLW|2.0|There should be an overview on what the symbols mean.....and how they work....not easy to use...will probably remove it...do not recommend this version
B008602KQI|5.0|It was great! I can't wait for the next one. It keep me on the edge all the way to the movie.
B008LY9AWG|1.0|I did not like this at all. So glad it was short. It's about men dying  with full details. TMI!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its fun but challenges the mind and can get frustrating when you can't figure some things out. I would definitely try it more often and recommend it to friends and family.
B006LSZECO|4.0|All the time I was enjoying this book I was thinking to myself that it was too convoluted. Still I enjoyed the book immensely, except for the ending. The ending is unique, but not satisfactory to this reader, though that might be more a flaw in myself then the book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Worth every penny, I want more! It's hard to put down and has really smoky graphics as well as very well timed hints.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|It was an okay read but got wordy in portions. Ending was predictable. Overall kept attention but was ready to move onto something new before I was finished. Not one of my favorites from.Nicholas Sparks
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My daughter is a bit young and small to fully enjoy but this Jumperoo has so many different pieces for her to play with that I'm sure it will be a favorite in the coming weeks.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The best one for me was before the update.  This one the picture does not fit my screen and the parts are hard to move.  It all so does not go together well.  So if you can send me the other one back I'll take it.  Thanks.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Product is exactly as has been described by seller. It is compact enough to eliminate the bulkiness of other cases, yet affords your Kindle Fire the needed protection.  Seller was also very prompt with shipping. Thanks.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Everything was going perfect until I got almost to the end. I made a mistake touching the runes and I'm stuck because I can't neither correct, nor continue. Don't know what to do
B00785P2QC|5.0|I just got this game last night and I already have a big city great job G5 keep em coming
B00004YRQA|5.0|I tossed mine out a while back forgetting you need it to play a lot of ps2 games. came fast and worked like they always do. ps2 is still fun!
034580404X|4.0|Thats definitely in my Top 10 books. Would highly recommend to anyone whos interested in BDSM. Or just for a good reading
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie was one of the best Bonds ever made, and before you say, &#34;No way!&#34; I own them all and have seen all of them many times. This one ranks up there!
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Star Trek will always be great. Nice picture quality. My only complaint is, the audio. I found myself having to constantly turn the volume up and down. But it's something I can live with. Other than that, I love it !
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I make it a habit to watch this at least once every two months. It is an amazing work of art and a good way to rebuild an amazing series! Also Asuka is hot!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Naptime just got easier 15 minutes and we are off to sleep. I love the timer just set it and it closes app when done.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I make it a habit to watch this at least once every two months. It is an amazing work of art and a good way to rebuild an amazing series! Also Rei is hot!
B00DF0POXA|5.0|One must respect the creativity put in this album. Every song is set to a new standard, making any artist set up their game. Each song brought something different, but superb sounds overall. A definitely noteworthy album.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I thought it would be very nice to have that app but when I loaded it said to give them permission and access to all my information, for my first born just about and I will not do that. to post on my behalf forget it where's the privacy.
0739366408|5.0|I listened to the World war Z audio book as a recommendation from a movie film/blog. It was excellent! I then went to see the film and was VERY disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You should get this game because it is just like taking care of a real horse you groom it feed it clean up after it and dress it up and level up this game is really fun i suggest you get it.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Marvel's the avengers is a very good movie. If you like Robert Downey Jr., you will enjoy it without regret.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|because you can do what ever you whant. Omg. wowI love it I don't. care I love it oooo omg
B00D6M86RS|1.0|Can't install on my or anyone else's Kindle Fire, but they sell it in app store on Kindle...hmmmm!?!? this is very perplexing on many levels.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|People use PicsArt, but this is better! This has my ability to do the sharpness, rotate, and effect it. PICSART CAN DO SOME BUT NOT rotating it or doing the sharpness.. I believe this will be easy for kids and adults who are not non-technology.. I'm 10 &amp; this is better than EVER!For get PICSART!#social, Remember PHOTO EDITOR!!!
B0062QRTKA|3.0|I downloaded this game because of all the good ratings it has.  I have been playing for about a week,  then I got rid of it.  The graphics are decent and the controls are pretty easy, but the characters come out at random never giving you a strategy on how to get all three stars. It's almost impossible to get all three.  If you do, then you've  been playing this game more than Koreans play Starscraft. I have a mild OCD syndrome when it comes to these mobile games. I have to get all stars on each level on every game I play.  Fix this randomness, and I would give it ALL 5 STARS!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Very fun and addictive. Lots of challenging things to find and do. Would recommend this to anyone who lives puzzles.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Intrigue, chicanery, wit, and wonder set in a rich, fantastical city brimming with colorful, sharply-drawn characters. A fantasy novel for adults. Hugely entertaining. The last third of the book flew by, gulped down in one sitting as I couldn't bear to wait to find out what happens. Sign me up for a return visit to the world of the Gentlemen Bastards.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This was given to my granddaughter and we enjoyed watching it together.  Technology update was wonderful. I would recommend for sure.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy all over again.  Great book and reads with as much excitement and intrigue as The Hunt for Red October.  Keep 'em coming.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|even though they male a lot of games like this it is still great it even replaced temple run2 and I think when we are board and have it on our phone or whatever we are going to play it
B004J4WNL2|2.0|The author points out the positive qualities of introverts, but annoyingly keeps saying it's superior to extroverts when in truth both have value.  Ironically, she then goes on to tell parents how to help their introverted children  become a little more extroverted.  In fairness, she also counsels parents to be accepting and respectful of their  introverted children's personalities.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The beginning almost lost me coming off of another series but a switch flipped and it has been hard to put down. Enjoying it so far.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was just a great continuation of the first book. I can't wait to start the 3rd book. Recommend it completely
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I likeish the app but now it will not let me go on it is annoying also when I go to look up my town, city and I look for my town it does not show the the right place I am in so it is not good enough for me I will get some other app I guess
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Other than the 12 hour down load time.this app might be good for you if you are into games.You will need to purchase the game their is nothing free about this app.if you don't intend on buying the full version of the game all's it does is take up space in your storage.I gave it the three stars for the graphics.Nothing more.like I said if you are serious about games maybe it's for you.I'm not spending my hard earned money on games ...
B008JFUQ16|5.0|\\"Despicable Me 2\\" returns with the life events of Gru and his daughters. This animated film does a good job with showing the happy emotional changes in Gru as a result of raising three girls. There is a funny scene in the movie where Gru shows his protective side.  I also liked how the movie depicted the changes of Dr. Nefario and the zany exploits of Gru's minions.  Gru also starts to become even more self-confident once he is partnered up with Lucy Wilde.\\"Despicable Me 2\\" is definitely recommend for those who liked the first \\"Despicable Me\\" film and/or animated films safe for all age groups.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|App is ok don't tell you how to use it.If you don't have computer skills this app may give you a hard time I'm still trying to figure it out all the wqy
B003SI3URQ|5.0|\\"Hercules\\" touches on the issue of being something larger than yourself. Hercules falls in love during his journey to attain growth in all areas of his life. The woman that he meets undergoes a complete emotional change after meeting him. There are various references to Greek mythology in this film, which is why it is a good family friendly movie.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Haven't even been able to use this after downloading it .I'm a real consumer and really I can't understand who would give this app anything but a bad review.I think the owner must have left the review I read .My friends on Facebook won't use it sorry.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Please update the minecraft fasster please I am begging you<br />And please put a magical are<br /> Update aloud in India
B005HSL626|5.0|i love this app! the only thing i don`t like is sometimes it gets a little laggy ( the picture has bad quality) but overall its a good game! 5 stars!
B003WE9TU8|3.0|If you really like survival horror then give it a go. I was hoping for one persons account. Using multiple surviver accounts made it hard to really feel for any of the characters. Still, I liked it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this is a great app! i use it nearly every morning! i love how you can use your own music to wake up. And its at a reasonable price! i love  this app, and you should get it! 5 stars for me!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A post-apocalyptic story created by the telling of \\"experiences\\" from around the world. My imagination required only the pictures this story told. A quick read and just enough character definition to keep me curious, but not overly concerned about any of them.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This helped my three year old adjust when we moved to a new home. I love that it works on iPhones iPads and kindles. Lots of sounds to pick from. Very realistic!
B004NIFSRA|3.0|Selling this book in a Kindle edition was a stroke of genius.<br /><br />Here we have a book with nothing to say - literally - but which says it in a fashion that conveys the truth by the very act of saying nothing. What better format for a such a book than the ephemerality of electrons? The nothing which is being said is conveyed by a medium which, in the Newtonian sense, does not exist.<br /><br />Of course, one might argue that the central idea is a ripoff of John Cage's 4'33, and it can be expected that Mr. Cage will be asserting his copyright on nothing in short order. In each case, nothing is expressed cogently, using the same medium of absence. But in this book, nothing is both longer and shorter than 4'33 - longer in that it contains many more pages, shorter in that it does not take as long to finish. Further, the nothing in the book is not expressed in words, whereas the nothing in 4'33 is not expressed in music. However, vice-versa, which would seem to support Mr. Cage.<br /><br />I do think, however, that the book is overpriced for Kindle. Expressing nothing, and contained in nothing, the obviously proper price is nothing.  And although I have not bought the book, it took me just as long to read as it would have, had I bought it. However, the strength of the Kindle edition over the paper edition is that you can delete it immediately, whereas the paper edition must be recycled.<br /><br />I also believe that the author has not expressed nothing as well as many other writers have. The book does not seem to have been edited. His control of the language, while precise and to the point, lacks the delicate nuances present in the true absence of anything, and which has been observed to be \\"eloquent\\" silence. This nothing is rather plebeian, and plods along at times. For this reason, I have only rated the Kindle edition at three stars.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was delighted when this book was published because I had really enjoyed this author's two previous books, \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\". Like the others, this book is set in Afghanistan.  And, like the others the characters are real and memorable and the history is fascinating.<br /><br />The book starts early in the 20th Century with the story of a brother and sister living in heart-rendering poverty.  Circumstances tear them apart and it is not until they reach old age that there is a bittersweet reconciliation.  Through the years there have been upheavals, wars,  and love affairs.  There's a lifetime of history, seen through the eyes of the people and the politicians and the various rebel and modern forces that have changed Afghanistan forever.<br /><br />The author has a good sense of his characters and the challenges they face.  I felt I knew them all personally and I certainly did come away with quite a bit more knowledge about Afghanistan and its people.<br /><br />It's a fine story, worth telling.  I couldn't take my eyes from my Kindle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can you escape is a very fun and<br /> pleasantly challenging game with many hidden puzzles.  i highly recommend this game to anyone, from kids to adults!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I would recommend this book to business men and women everywhere. There is a lot of food for thought here from evaluating your own perspectives to looking at what barriers exist in your workplace. It was hard for me to be sympathetic to Sheryl's challenges with raising her family because of the support system she has in place but her points are no less valid. And her point about women needing to &#34;lean in&#34; to their careers was refreshing. I totally agreed with the section on the need for women to support each other. Overall, worth the time to read.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Moral of the story: not all actors work well in a green screen movie. There was no chemistry between any of these folks - this was just really poor casting all around.  Zero movie magic.  James Franco was awkward as hell in this role. Mila Kunis' transformation was....odd. Thumbs way down from me.
B009CWWFD2|3.0|I found the first 200 pages of this book enjoyable but then it just dragged on and on. It was about two competing characters. Neither one was likable so I had little interest in the outcome.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Funny, action-packed, my wife liked it. That's pretty good in my house. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|If you've not seen the musical I would give it three stars.  If you plan to see the show, listening to the cd in advance will not hurt your experience,
B007PTJOV0|4.0|my niece plays this more than me but its ok. would recommend it to anyone who likes simple adventure games
0307352153|5.0|Love this book!  While reading it I kept saying \\"yes, that's me, yes, finally someone gets me.\\" I want to buy this book and give it to friends and family to better understand me.  :)  I liked it so much, after reading the copy I checked out from the library, I bought a copy for myself from Amazon so I can revisit it whenever I want!  I would definitely recommend it to others.
B00005N6KG|1.0|it's cheap. the sound is dissent.<br />lasted for a month of running 3x week. no matter how careful i was with them, they stopped working quickly.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|First and foremost let me say that it was worth the purchase price in that we were able to watch the film from the comfort of our home without going anywhere and paying the high price of a movie theater. BUT, the format is this squinched up strip across the TV screen with a black strip above and a black strip below; not exactly the full screen that one would expect. Also after the promos are played the format does not go directly into the movie. One has to play the promos about five or six times before the DVD plays the movie. So one gets to see the movie...is it worth the hassle? You decide.<br />This problem is the same with every DVD that I have purchased thru Amazon. Perhaps it's my DVD player? That's possible, but all of the movies that I have purchased at a store don't do this.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The storyline went by as usual, but something in the way most loose ends got tied up to perfectly just felt wrong. This wasn't the ending I was hoping for, and that might also have a great say..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Before downloading this app, I would have the best intentions to want to read my paper Bible daily but you know the drill. Now it's part of my routine once I get up in the morning and check my phone, the first thing I do is read and listen to God's Word.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Graphics are stunning and the sound effects are amazing. You can play this game for hours. Very good for children as well as adults. I think everyone should try this game.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|the graphics are bad and she only has like 30 strands of hair that are stick straight or a little wavey. this game would work better if it took more of an animated look like the Icon for the app shone up at the top of the screen. the graphics look nothing like the Icon.
B00881VLCE|2.0|My whole family LOVED this app until it was updated. Now it runs very slow. It takes forever to move the pieces and they don't have a seamless connection like they did before the update. Very disappointed. Before the update I would have given this 5 stars.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I thought I would never get away from carrying a pocket calendar, but the ease of entering data and use has me reconsidering.  The multiple displays are nice.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Highly read-able, fun and informative. Fascinating study of the aspergers-type mind. Background mystery adds to the tension and the conclusion is very satisfying. This is a novel I will recommend  to my friends - and I will be looking out for other titles by this author.
B007KUFDBY|4.0|Okay, so humans and aliens are traveling through space without a spacesuit! You have to put your scientific mind aside and just enjoy the ride. It's a fun movie with great characters and Disney does a great job developing them. The story is based on Treasure Island and follows it pretty closely. I'd rather watch this movie than the original as Treasure Island is a bit outdated.
B005OYKIJ0|5.0|This is part fo the Fast and Furious sequels and is hte best. The action is non-stop and the clever plot turns keep you guessing on what is really happening. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes plenty of action with humorous moments.
B00C8USQEM|4.0|Great Cast and writing.<br />Find that it is easy to watch the episodes over and over.<br />Blu Ray is very sharp and clear.<br />I would recommend to everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The last book of the series was very dark  ,but it was so well written . I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I THINK IT DESERVES<br />Six Stars.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|This movie is so much better than I expected. The story is very good. So are all the lead actors.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game.  It can really become habit-forming!  Would suggest it to all - can't beat the price<br />on it either!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Short game after short game of strategic battles, that gets progressively harder, but with more capabilities to fight the zombies (with plants - so it is not really violent).  Silliness and fun, but be careful that it can waste a lot of time and keep you up late without trying!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun to play...I like that I don't have to be connected to wireless to play.  Easy to use. Some extra features are added to change your card backing. or the background for a change of pace
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Had this album on loop for a good stint of a road trip through Europe.  Love it!  Passenger has definitely not lost his touch!
B0042YHC38|5.0|So I received my product much faster than expected which was great to start with. The product also held great to my arm while jogging (which was a concern of mine since I'm not exactly a big guy). It was a little tight getting the phone in (bc mine has a case) but once in, it wasn't going anywhere. All in all, I would highly recommend this product to anybody looking for a nice iPhone armband :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so addictive. Once you start you have yo finish. Level 30 here I come in im on level six using two. Devices and still want more.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|Bought this movie thinking it was gonna be the entire movie but alas!!! It's cut all to pieces. Better to buy a copy from Walmart or something.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I downloaded this game a few nights ago and it was definitely worth it. It made me feel a little like. Sherlock Holmes looking for clues to solve the puzzles. I had an awesome time playing it and I know you would too. The only thing is, I wish there was more levels to complete.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I've only played 5 levels but so far the game is pretty fun.  Not that challenging in these early levels, but I expect it to get harder as it goes on.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|Unless the channel you are looking for happens to be one of the channels being featured, you won't find them. No search function, no refresh function, and you can't get more than 20 streams in a games list when there are hundreds active. I love twitch, but this app isn't worth the free download right now. Lots of functionality needs to be added to make it a worthwhile app.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have had no problems using this app on all my devices.  I use it on my phone, ipod, nook, and kindle.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|they just keep making a great game better . the new levels. are more fun and challenging. Well worth the small price as the graphics are great. I really enjoyed it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not extremely challenging, but killed a few hours. I was really bummed to only have 10 levels, but it was free, so whatever.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|Real air of authenticity; ingenious reworking of modern &#34;standards&#34;. The only negative is that the total length is on the short side.
0062014536|3.0|while the ending of the Hunger Games was bittersweet it was Fin he end you had an ending here we don't know spoilers ahead; it needed true closure here we do not have this I cannot say if I enjoyed or really hated any character, I totally identified with Lena's jealousy as well as Alex's that I did get I did get him hating her at the end of the 2nd Novel and I did Lena not realizing he truly cared for her she was a kid who was taught never to love what do we expect the pain of first true love HURTS but at the same time...<br /><br />... do we truly think that the rebellion simply overwhelmed the entire government? A novel idea but too short sighted, do we truly believe Juilian simply stands aside? that Hana's family and what will happen in the aftermath of all that transpired. I do not mind not having a happy ending most endings aren't happy and most truths are hard to bear but there was something missing from this book something that she could of wrapped up in an epilogue, yes the characters are YOUNG and young love is never easy or hardly without pain but I expected a tiny bit more. For the record I loved Hana returning and even with the cure valiantly fighting to become the Hana she knew once that was the most heartbreaking aspect of the novel for me.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Cute and very fun! The graphics are great and the dragons are adorable! Just need some patience for the best dragons to be hatched and fed.
B009MYARIK|4.0|This book was an easy book to read. Plot was a little slow to start. Fun to read to the end. Characters were a little different than some in her other books. Would recommend to others as an easy red !
1451695195|1.0|I was excited to read this book to bolster my faith but it didn't take long to realize this is nothing but a new age feel good book. If you are a person of faith (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) then the title of this book is misleading. Where the author went in his NDE is not the heaven of the bible. It can't be.  If I remember correctly, Jesus was not mentioned until page 134 and he was quoting what someone else said. Jesus is mentioned so few times (2 that I could find) that He's not in the index. He mentions that the \\"Big Bang\\" was one of god's exclamation points. Another part talks about a woman that went into a trance so she could speak to him while he was out of body. This author brings a whole new meaning to \\"you can't judge a book by it's cover.\\"
B0000A33QW|5.0|this is my sister's favorite Elvis movie....so I got her a copy of the DVD...& one for myself...I'm a BIG Elvis fan!!!
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This is a wonderful collection.  Hours of enjoyment, and a choice of subtitles -  German,English, French.  Great for winning over your friends who are not opera-lovers.  They may become converts!
B000W91RUG|5.0|My husband & I have seen EVERY episode....he likes to read the &#34;blurb&#34; at the end of the show...so we pause it & he reads it aloud....
B00000J2SO|3.0|this cd seemed highly rated on this site. it start's off with what sound's like Paul Stanley singing but it's Graham Bonnet in his only appearance on a Rainbow album.I feel this cd is background music til the fifth song which is ''since you've been gone'', a great cover of former ARGENT guitarist Russ Ballard.listen to his version,then listen to Ritchie Blackmore's treatment of the track. nite and day difference.the cd get's better after track five and the other track that get's my attention is ''lost in hollywood''. I can see those guy's drivin' round that town lost.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|I've been a fan of Kanye's basically since the beginning of his career. Not a huge fan but a casual one. \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" was a great album and I was hoping Yeezus could top it, instead I got something that's trying way too hard to be artistic and different.<br /><br />The lyrics aren't as clever as he usually is, with a few exceptions like \\"I Am A God\\" which lyrically is classic egotistical Kanye but musically is pretty hard to listen to. Most of the songs will just devolve to random screaming and yelling. It might be considered \\"art\\" but it sounds like garbage which defeats the purpose of music in my eyes.<br /><br />I'm glad I listened to it once, just because it was so different but it definitely wasn't worth the money.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|the story takes a while to get interesting, but once it does, it's incredible. this movie is a must see.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This was a great flick. Not overly cheezy and has a good story. A lot can be learned from this too! Very motivating to be confident and approach people.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It kept my interest. Couldn't put it down. Recommend to anyone that likes love stories.Good for young people and adults.
B0034G4P80|4.0|I liked the movie very much!  I bought this particular copy as a birthday gift for a friend and she thoroughly enjoyed it!  It arrived to her residence in good time and in excellent condition!  Success!
B009POCG2C|5.0|The movie is well done, deals with life as well as baseball. Sometimes one's intuition is more important than what statistics might reveal!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game, I play on my iPhone as well as my kindle. Perfect to pass time, or just for a little fun! Recommend to everyone!!!
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This movie is both thrilling and terrifying. Very Jack London. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie.
1451696191|3.0|I don't understand what all the buzz is about. Maybe because I didn't drink or use drugs as a teenager, that part doesn't hit home for me. But I saw &#34;Go Ask Alice&#34; when I was 13.  That was powerful.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book is a perfectly reasonable coming of age story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It does work I am 11yrs old and I crack my kindle screen and I am so good with technology that I got it to work again because it turned off and did not turn back on but when I  did my thing I got it to work again but I can help the viewer's that think it does not work .<br />1:get app<br />2:wait  by hitting the home button and STAY on it<br />3:while waiting  watch it down load<br />4:then when it is done u know what to do<br />5:then hit the game do not NO matter what do not exist out of the game then it will download and then it will start to work<br />Who ever says thanks then ur welcome<br />Love,<br />Otayvia
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Cynthia Rose: I have a confession to make.<br />Fat Amy: We all know where this is going. Lesbihonest.<br />Cynthia Rose: This is hard for me to admit to you guys, but for the past two years, I have had a serious gambling problem.<br />Fat Amy: What?<br />Beca: What?<br />Cynthia Rose: It all started when I broke up with my girlfriend.<br />Fat Amy: Whomp, there it is!
0446580848|1.0|I am a big fan of Nelson DeMille, read all his books. This one I could not finish. John got on my nerves giving the smart ass way too often and I was missing a story that is compelling and thrilling.  After all the other books by Nelson are really great so I will try out the next one! Let us just forget about the Panther.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|OMG, just finished season 7, and as always, it did not disappoint.<br /><br />The writers are the best; creative, quirky, intense, unchained.<br /><br />BRAVO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008I43DYU|4.0|I put this on my Kindle fire so when I needed a calculator I would have one, have used it several times big numbers and keeps track of what you have done, so if you need to go back and look you can and find it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how it updates on its own so ot doesn't ask you to update it yourself. Great game!!!!!!! Love the graphics!!!
B005DN5BE4|5.0|I needed to watch this movie for a class project and it was much better than I expected it to be! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. It is not only fun but is challenging and thought provoking.  Great way to teach problem solving to kids.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Wow!  From the very first I was poised to not like this reproduction.  However the first movie had me hooked.  This second installment, while a different tone and message than the first, did not disappoint in the least.  Live long and prosper Star Trek!<br /><br />(keep the movies coming)
0060936223|5.0|A great read, a fascinating insight into it's time and place, and told with some lovely prose, and great anecdotes.
0805028846|5.0|If you have an affinity for creating cards, this is the book for you. I've been making cards since I was a little girl-my first being a homemade, penciled quad-fold. I also have half a library of pop-up books-if this sounds like you, too, then you'll be happy with this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this app. Not too hard but not too easy. Good graphics. I really enjoyed this one. Give it a try. Worth your time.
0385721234|5.0|I've purchased at least a dozen of this book for gifts, it's that good. The movie was nice, but the book is fabulous. I've created several of the recipes and even started a movie menu night with my kids when they come to visit; not just dinner and a movie pairings, but creating dishes that are being served in the movie itself! Start with movierecipes.net.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|I recently wrote a negative review of Reacher #12.  Happily, with this next installment, Reacher is back on track.  One disappointment in that a key mystery in the plot line was left unresolved, but to some extent this decision by Child to leave this question unanswered is supported by the storyline.  So I guess I'll have to live with this lack of resolution, and overall highly recommend this read to other Reacher fans.
1607053888|5.0|Great patterns and very easy to follow. I have recommend this book to so many of my friends who like making bags. I hope the author continues to create new patterns and importantly to keep it simply and easy to follow. The detail pictures were great and I am a visual person so I found this book excellent.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Ok,for those of u who rate this 1 star,there's something wrong with you.I've finally experienced the Nether Reactors,built a mansion out of DIAMOND BLOCKS,and placed bedrock,cameras,etc.I totally reccomend this app.It is truly the most amazing add-on to Minecraft Pocket Edition ever!I'd reccomend the pro edition,but regular is fun too! -Ace0605
B005COO1X6|4.0|Great short read that keeps you on the edge of your seat, with a little twist of Christine in it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Hugh Howey's Wool really reminded me of Logan's Run - except here, the last remaining people on earth live in underground silos instead of under a dome. The same fear tactics by the hierarchy apply in both novels - that is: never go outside or you shall perish! In Wool, those who are punished are sent outside 'to clean', whereas in Logan's Run, the people who try to escape (to the outside world) seek 'sanctuary'. Interesting similarities are evident throughout the book.<br />I really like this series and shall continue with Book 6 (First Shift) - mainly because we (finally/supposedly) learn how the earth got to this post-apocalyptic state - which I was dying to find out throughout books 1-5. This is the only reason I gave this book(s) 4 stars instead of 5 -still waiting for answers! But I shall read on!
B00280LYHS|5.0|All the books by Rick Riordan are the best books that I have ever read ansd I m going to continue lovin them
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this app so very much. it's so so so cool! I love when you pick out her lipstick and makeup and then dress her up all fancy. I like to make everything match.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awsome because i just got like two days ago and im preety far on it already and when i got i was so excited.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Best  ZZ TOP  album in years.  Great return to their blues sound Billy Gibbons guitar work is amazing.  Return to what made the Top great
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a fun game. I loved the puzzles and found them challenging at times. I really like that its free!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I found that this game is a lot more fun than any of the other games that I have on my kindle. This program allows me to pass the time when I am bored. I really enjoy playing this program and would recommend this program to all my friends and family. I am also happy that this program was as described to me.
B00D2ZF24O|1.0|\\"Danger is real<br />Fear is a choice\\"<br /><br />Don't you like it how these morons in some room somewhere come up with these stupid little phrases that are completely idiotic yet are invented with the idea of possibly sounding profound?<br />Fear isn't a choice, that's one of the dumbest things I've ever read anywhere.  COURAGE is a choice, not fear.  Living beings have fear, it doesn't matter how brave you are, even the bravest people in the world have fear if and when confronted with something that can kill them.  Fear is in biology, it's literally apart of human beings & humans cannot separate themselves from fear.  COURAGE is how you react to that fear.<br /><br />To put stupid words on the front of movies like that not only gives false information about how human beings are in general, it also can depict how much intelligence has gone into the movie itself.<br /><br />Zero stars.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I wasn't very happy with this program, but someone else might be. I couldn't see the fun in this game so I got rid of it, but my older sister seems to really enjoy this game do I think that the fact I didn't enjoy the game only means that I was the only one. This game was fun and I did like taint out the pigs. This game also helped me to work on my anger; because whenever I was mad all I had to do to get in a better mood was play this really funny game. I took this off my kindle so that I would have more room on my device. I would recommend this game to all my friends and family.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|That was my first question when I saw the production of Phantom on public TV. I was immediately enthralled with his voice. He certainly has the gift for performing and including his audience in each and every song. His passion comes out so much you can feel it. I am now a fan!!
B0013FDM7E|5.0|This item got to me in a timely fashion. I was very happy with the way in which this seller got this item to me. I am also happy that this item was in the condition that was described to me. I would recommend this seller to all my friends and family.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|Every time I listen to this, I get lost in the music. Andrew Lloyd Webber has a true gift in writing music and he has chosen people to sing his music that perfectly fits each song. The characters come alive in your mind when you play the songs  and you become hooked. I play the CD and the DVR over and over. I almost am so sad that Love Never Dies is the end, I cry every time I view the DVD. I won't give away the ending, but you will be shocked to the core!
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Great app for if you have multiple computers ! Have been using this program for about a year now and I have not had any problems !
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved this season of Downton except for the death of the youngest daughter and the ending of the final episode of the season it broke my heart Matthew is one of my favorite characters.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A magical tale of being true to one's soul. Fun to read as it sparks the latent dreams you may have forgotten or set aside.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great story and artistic style!  Amazingly true how lives can drift apart yet come back together.  Wish it was not so sad, though.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini masterfully creates characters who come to life in varied settings and circumstances and then artfully weaves their life stories together.  The young girl sold by her desperate father and how this effects the lives of numerous characters is skillfully crafted and believable.  Hosseini is the rare writer that can step into the minds of men, women and children of all ages and circumstance and make them real.  Entertaining, heartwarming, and disturbingly real, this novel is hard to put down.  My book club loved it as we have his last two.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Book makes you question until the end. As you read you feel the need for more. Interesting murder-mystery thriller. You won't want to put it down!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My daughter loves it. The only thing that can overshadow it a little is the need of real cash to accomplish bigger things.
B006JD48NM|5.0|BEST F1 DOCUMENTARY EVER MADE! Even someone with little or no exposure to motorsport would enjoy this film. I highly recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I can't get enough of Bosch or Connelly...I have read all of his books (at least I think I have).  This character is so complicated and yet so endearing.  I love the way Connelly writes.  The words just kind of flow from the page, and it all sounds very real.  Some mystery writings are always able to really capture the essence of what goes on with detectives, but Connelly does so beautifully.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app because I can read anytime, and just about anywhere.  It always works and it's easy on the eyes.  It remembers your location so you don't waste time finding the page you were on.  It's great!  I read more now because I always remember my phone ;-)
B008K9SG9K|4.0|Overall, this is a good album.  My favorites are of course, &#34;Radioactive&#34; and &#34;Demons&#34;.  Some of the songs are a bit repetitive so that makes me fast forward to the next track.  I love the drums in most of their songs.  The only ballad is &#34;Every Night&#34; which is good and makes me wish for more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is so romantic but scary. i fear when this happens to ourworld....... if it does. i cant wait to download the second book to my kindle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this game. I anxiously await the new levels since this was pretty short. The levels were fun and a few times, a bit puzzling. However, I think it's a bit easier than 100 floors and more fun. I loved 100 floors, but found myself totally stuck and needing to refer to the cheat guide now and then. This is just challenging enough to make it fun without the stress. Good job and Thanks!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|As a late watcher of Vampire Diaries, I really enjoyed getting another back season to watch. I can watch at my leisure or do a marathon and get up to date. I would recommend this to anyone who loves vampire movies or series, like Buffy or Dark Shadows.
B006MVG9SI|3.0|This album is what you'd get if this group released these songs back in 1982. Comes with lyrics on inner sleeve, and a MpFree download card
B003UESJH4|5.0|It is a keeper that closeley follows an excellent book.  The price was right and the time was right to add to our collection.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Not viewing the first season, i happened onto a collection of it..and watched. Found it rivetting so buying the following season just followed on..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the game, but ten floors isn't nearly enough.Give me a skyscraper full and I'll STILL want more( and more)
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|This book forgot what made the first book series so good the action. Now it's just a boring love story that I don't care about.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|We had seen this opera on PBS twice and loved everything about it - music, costumes, actors.  My husband asked for it for his birthday.
B005TBWN0K|3.0|Freezes a lot on my kindle fire hd!! I have a hard time drawing things but overall It is a great app!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I gave it that ranking because the book was really enjoyable and its genre was fantastic also the characters made you feel and care for them so as you were reading you would feel bad for the characters or you will be excited for what will happen next.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|excellent and easy to install and use on my wife's kindle.  needed a way to share everything with friends on a trip and this was perfect
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game but sometimes it doesn't load . The graphics are awesome and it's a really good game for people who love horses.
B0065AVS0K|4.0|Not typically my type of movie genre. Benecio Del Toro and Mickey Rourke disappear in their roles. Fun to watch.
B008MM9630|4.0|This game is pretty fun. I find it enjoyable. The only problem i have, is that gems are hard to get, then you have to buy them if you want a lot.
B004W25KKW|4.0|I enjoyed the background info more than than the personal stories of success just because of my interest in memory for my architectural thesis. The success stories were capturing and allowed a great continuity to the book which kept it exciting.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a really fun game from g5.keep them coming. Highly recommended. Worked great on my kindle fire. Thanks g5'

Buy a copy for your 20-something son, your husband, your brother, too.<br /> I just finished Lean In, an eye-opening read on bias in the workplace and a mind-expanding way to look at life's decisions, and a gender-bending manifesto. I was on my way to amazon.com to order a copy for my daughter, a brand new Ph.D. in marine biology. I couldn't wait to pick up the phone and ask my MBA sister-in-law if she has read it yet. Then thunder struck me. I should order it for my son, too,( if I had one.) I should call my brother, the other MBA half on the couple, and ask him if he's read this book.<br />Sandberg explores what's behind so few women making it to the top of the business ladder. The gender roadblocks and differences should engage any student, young adult, manager, or executive. Along the way the reader is privy to the inside story of a business star, not a woman's success story, but a success story. Finishing the last page is only the beginning. Of insight. Of conversation. Of hopefully progress personally and professionally for everyone, male and female.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|Frequently sequels or imitations or take-offs or whatever the designator you choose of famous older movies prove to be ho-hum to poor. If that is the thought about RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES then give this film a chance. It has a lot of nuances we don't expect from movies of this genre - introducing the concept of genetic therapy, for example - in addition to the fact that it has a superb cast on both extremes of the animal spectrum!<br /><br />The principal player is Caesar (beautifully enacted by Andy Serkis at the later age and by Terry Notary in the early phase), a chimpanzee who gains human-like intelligence and emotions from the experimental drug ALZ 112, a drug that causes neurogenesis, which allows the brain to grow new brain cells (something that doesn't happen after birth) and heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to the eyes. Raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (James Franco in a very fine, sensitive role) and a primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto), Caesar ultimately finds himself taken from the humans he loves and imprisoned in an ape sanctuary in San Bruno. Seeking justice for his fellow inmates, Caesar gives the fellow apes the same drug that he inherited. He then assembles a simian army and escapes the sanctuary - putting man and ape on a collision course with dire possibilities.<br /><br />Blended into this story are some fine subplots and the presence of such excellent actors as John Lithgow, Brian Cox, David Oyelowo among others. The screenplay was written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver whose ideas came form the Pierre Boulle novel,  `La plan&egrave;te des singes'. The direction is in the sure hands of Rupert Wyatt and of course considerable credit is due to the special effects and costume/makeup crew.  This is a fine summer evening's entertainment!

B000ZELISO|2.0|I have enjoyed other Harry Potter movies, and have read some of the books. I found this to be rather mixed up and confusing, kind of a mish-mash. Also, maybe it's just my DVD player, but many of the scenes seemed over-dark visually, not enough light or contrast to even tell what was going on.<br /><br />For being so long, it seemed there were a fair number of parts that moved pretty slowly.<br /><br />If someone had not previously had a lot of exposure to the Harry Potter stories, it would be quite confusing.<br /><br />As usual, Severus Snape was well acted, and there were a few good parts. But overall, seemed kind of a waste of time.
0439023521|4.0|Plotwise there is nothing new in &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;.  So, how does Suzanne Collins manage to use recycled plots (a boy/girl story) and still create riveting reading for all age groups and not just young adults?  This is a question that is not so easy to answer.  In the same way that J. K. Rowling used derivative plotlines and characters in her Harry Potter books (wizards, spells, and children in jeapordy are not new and caused her book to be rejected by dozens of publishers) Suzanne Collins uses tried and true plotlines (a self-less act, retaining one's humanity while succeeding in the face of adversity) that have worked in stories for thousands of years.  &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; may not have worked so well if Suzanne Collins hadn't made it a 'coming of age' story about a girl having to change her perceptions.  Katniss Everdeen has survived so far by relying on her wits and skill.  It is not easy for her to accept the possibility of help and unconditional love from a non-family member (Peeta Mellark the baker's son) and survive a televised game that feeds on the grisly deaths of its contestants.  (We have futuristic gladiators on reality television taken to the extreme.)  This is where &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; gets elevated to the level of wry social commentary just as Paddy Chayefsky did with his screenplay &#34;Network&#34;.  So, how did Suzanne Collins manage to write such a wonderful book?  The answer is that she carefully crafted her story to appeal to our preconceived expectations for story.  You should read &#34;Wired for Story&#34; for a more in-depth explanation.  So it is.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Great characters.  Great actors.  Great story line.  Not sure everyone gets the underlying meaning of this movie's story line but I absolutely dig it.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Interesting take on how our whole world and systems of government, society and cultures would fair in an all out zombie apocalypse!
B005T87QCI|4.0|I hope its. a good game I saw the movie the movie was good now lets see the game is good.!!!!!!
B004XVMCMQ|2.0|I'm afraid any resemblance between this movie and Jane Austen's work is purely coincidental. I was hoping to like it as I enjoyed Jonny Lee Miller in BBC's Emma, but I'm afraid the characters in this movie are so immensely changed in their nature that I cannot like it well at all. If you do not know Jane Austen's work then you might enjoy this as a period piece. If you are a Jane Austen fan and enjoy Fanny Price as a sweet, steadfast girl (whatever her faults of being timid), then I would not recommend this version.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Wow, what can I say about this CD.  I LOVE it!!!  I just can't stop listening to it. I was heart broken when the whole Geoff thing happened because Queensryche has been my favorite band for the last 25 years or so. I have seen them in concert several times, have bought every CD and DVD they have released, and I even have  a Tri-ryche tattoo. I just like everyone else did not know what to expect and I didn't know how the band could go on without that wonderful voice.  Granted the last couple of CDs have not been my favorite and Geoff's vocals have not been as clean and clear as they had been in the past but I did not want to see the band broken and lost forever.  Well I am happy to see that did not happen.  Ryche is back and sounding amazing.  Todd has come onto the scene and brought some powerhouse vocals with him.  Michael, Eddie, Scott, and Parker all sound as perfect as ever.  Michael and Parker really sound great doing the \\"twin guitar\\" that has become a signiture sound for Queensryche.  Eddie's super bass lines and Scott's spot on drumming ability is just more proof that the heart of Queensryche is strong and very much alive.  The songs on this CD are so very much like the songs that made me fall in love with Queensryche 25 years ago.  Back are the strong intelligent lyrics about hard hitting subjects that made Ryche the \\"Thinking Man's Metal Band\\" that has kind of been missing for the last few years.  The deluxe edition has 3 live tracks that show just how wonderful these guys are live and how very well the chemistry is working.  Todd, (although at times sounds very much like Geoff)still brings his own style and fire to both the new songs and old favorites like Enforce and Queen of the Ryche.  My only complaint about this CD is the length.  I played it through the first time and when it ended I wanted more.  This CD will rock your ass off so what are you waiting for buy it already! Ryche & Roll Forever!!!!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love all the different games available to play and the option to be able to beat your own score on each one. Great fun app!
B003B02O7I|5.0|This suspenseful novel is really entertainment at its best.  The Testament is a nice reminder to me of parts of my life that I want to forget, things I too have hidden from, global culture /diversity surrounds us, and the importance of me giving myself to bad things or good things.  The Testament's impacts show faith in power and greed verses faith in God.  Like a good television show, in which a viewer can't wait for the next episode, The Testament kept me excited to read the next chapter
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My 5 year old granddaughter loves this  and so does my disabled daughter.  They have hours of fun dressing and making up the Princess.  I even caught my grandson playing with it the other day.
1878424319|5.0|I already read this book in Spanish and it was very educating. A most read book for everyone who wants to improve themselves and self confidence.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I only read the first Percy Jackson book so I don't know some parts but it was still a great book and I suggest it to anyone who likes Greek mythology and Rick Riordan books.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Wonderful voice, characters and ingenious plot! I've got a reading list of all Craig Johnson's Longmire books. All of waht I look for in a good story.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Compact, lightweight and provides the protection I wanted.  Coupled with the low cost, this case is ideal for home and travel.
B003TH5L7S|5.0|love it, love it love it....purchased it before a trip, sadly I found out that I could not download all the episodes from this season to my kindly? I have no other videos stored on my device and it said it does not have enough memory?<br />So I would have had to find a wi fi connection and download it, after moving it from the device to the cloud?<br /><br />Just wanted to give this piece of info for anyone downloading to a kindle fire....if you know how to fix the issue, please let me know.
B00C6TUXN2|4.0|Let's Face the Music and Dance is a warm, intimate recording from Willie Nelson and the Family Band.  Unlike some of his other recordings over the last few years, Nelson's vocals are sharper.  While they still show years of wear and tear, the effect is distinguishing on this collection of standards.  I would have liked the album to be filled with songs like his take on Irving Berlin's \\"Let's Face The Music And Dance\\" as it sets such a relaxing tone and mood.  It is easy to image the musicians on a small stage at a restaurant or bar with the minimal setup of guitar, stand-up bass, piano, drums, and harmonica.  The last of these is important as Mickey Raphael really shines on a number of songs - most notably \\"Walking My Baby Back Home\\".  My Other favorites include \\"You'll Never Know\\" and \\"Twilight Time\\" as they follow the mood of the opener.  As a bit of a tangent, I found \\"Vous Et Moi\\" to be very similar to the opening track on Teatro.  The one song on this album that I didn't care for was \\"Maria\\".  It was the one place where Nelson's vocals seemed to come up short, and I just don't like that song very much.  Otherwise, this is a very solid offering from a musical legend.  I recommend it to all Willie Nelson fans, and I hope to see more Nelson albums that follow this style.<br /><br />Download this:  Let's Face The Music And Dance
B00C061I3K|5.0|Ok. It's not really THAT good. It is quite excellent though. If you're into disco and funk and dance music. The collaborations are quite fascinating too. The 2 songs featuring Pharrell are outstanding. The song with Panda Bear is also at the top. Then there is this song featuring Paul Williams and you are like \\"what the hell is this? It sounds like Broadway!!???!!\\" Then....you google Paul Williams and learn that this is the guy from the original Muppets movie!! And he played Little Enos in Smokey and the Bandit!! And you are like \\"I remember that guy!! He's funny looking!!\\" And all is forgiven and you actually start liking that song. Great album. Good work boys.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Really good game. The company do tend to try and suck up your money by making items hard to get in game. But it's a good entertaining game.
B000HLDFK4|4.0|This is a great movie with romance, and who doesn't love a great movie with Keanu and Sandra?? Awesome movie!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game reminds me of the Chinese puzzle boxes I remember as a child, only in digital form.  I loved it and hope another one comes out soon. If you want to really work something out, not just mindlessly push buttons, give this a try.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|not a bad cd from chris brown although I would love the clean version if the release one o well
B00C33M2EE|5.0|This is an excellent CD/DVD set. The Piano Guys always come through with beautiful music. I love to listen to this CD while reading. My favorites at this time are \\"Just The Way You Are\\" & \\"Nearer My God To Thee\\". This is a lovely CD and the DVD is a nice visual addition. Thanks Piano Guys!
B009MO5E10|5.0|For a show about bike riders in New York it was pretty good. So check it out pretty good action
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Want something different from a zombie movie rather than the usual \\"kill 'em all anyway you can\\" type? This is it. A funny, feel good movie about hope and love against the worst odds.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have Resisted online reading until now.  I have authored 2 books that can be offered through Kindle. But not until mow have I subcombed to the best idea since Ben Franklin created the Library. I am very busy with writing and preparing seminar information and KINDLE has made it very easy for me to carry all my reference books every where I go and have access to all of them no matter which of my 9 devices I am using. I can read wherever I am like in the grocery line, at the nail shop, at church (the Bible, of course) at the mall while the kids are enjoying a movie, at the pool. Don't need a heavy book bag anymore. This is hot!  GOD Bless the creators of such a marvelous tool. Kindle is absolutely awesome! What took me so long to catch on to Kindle...guess I was a little resistant to change.  Afterall, I am over 65!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Personally I like movies that entertain and take me away from real life. This movie has some funny moments, but it seemed too close to real life. Kind of made me hope I never get married and have kids.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|fun and hard too. give it a try and have some fun with it. so start it and see it
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|The acting wasn't the greatest in this movie. It was easy to figure out what was going to happen next. No surprises there. Lots of predictable action, but still it was entertaining. What really saves it in my opinion is what Hansel says at the end. I would have scored it lower otherwise.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|play it and you will be hooked, i did and now i am going to be hook on this one too
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I am a die hard fan and this latest addition to the series is just as action packed as the others. Thankfully there were no overly cheesy lines like in some other action movies. It was just Bruce Willis doing his thing, and helping out his kid. Love it. It wasn't hard to figure out where the plot twist was going to be before it happened, but that didn't bother me at all. They need to make one more with his daughter getting in on the action.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|well I started playing and can't stop. just give it a shot and you will be hooked. try it today
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|The only down side to this was Mila Kunis becoming the Wicked Witch. Don't get me wrong, she did a wonderful job, but I would have rather seen her as the Good Witch. Just my opinion. Other than that, this movie was a great prequel. It followed the story line well. There was adventure, battle, love, surprise, humor. It's great for anyone with a heart, a brain, and a little courage. I'm going to watch it again.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|The scanner did scan fast. The film strip holder was scratched after about 10 slides. The color of the scanned pictures was way to red. I tried playing with the picture to get the color correct, but it would take me way to long to correct every picture. There is an adjustment for brightness, but not for color.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is something to do when you are board or you just want to do something. I love to play this game. If you bought this one then get Doodle Devil or Doodle Farm they are great games to.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The reason I downloaded this game is because my friend suggested this to me. So far it is really fun! calling all horse lovers!
0880796863|3.0|Well i was curious about this because I'm a psychology major but i will not talk about Tarot itself. The product it self is as advertised. This set is for the the beginner.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Lots of fun and very engaging. For only $2, I feel like I got my money's worth, but coming to the end is always disappointing. Great game...hurry back with more challenges.
B006PKQQJS|3.0|Not the best app really hard and i thought it was more for styling hair but its more of an upgrading game making the salon better.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Nicer than the Motorola visor speakerphone I replaced.  Not sure why, might be my Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone, but the  voice that asks you for the name and number you want to call, is barely audible.  Not sure how to increase that volume. Incoming and outgoing calls work fine.  I like the setting where it senses your phone as you get in your car automatically and is ready to go. So far so good.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|Really hard and its not a fun game i never play it, its boring i would suggest not to get it.
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|This movie was ok, but with Lucy Lou and Russell Crow makes it work. This movie is worth having in your collection.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the app but i dont like that it gets a little boring after awhile. I wish it could have villagers and more animal's. But it is a  really fun app though suggest getting this app!!!!:)
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|Tom is very good in this movie, with bit of a good change of pace. A real ok action movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is by all means one of the greatest escape games of the many many that I have played. Thank you.
B008XCF7Y6|4.0|I enjoy all the Starship Trooper movies. The bugs are the ugliest things in this space and more! Lets have more!!!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I like it because of adventure but dislike it because of Prim`s death .it was super  very exciting but gory and violent
B006GWO5NE|5.0|After my first kindle fire charger ceased to work I started using this one. Not only did it work, but it is remarkably faster than my original
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Not a bad way to kill time. Pretty fun as these games generally<br /> go. good variety of stuff to do.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Great book. I hope the movie is just as good! The characters were brought to life and I was surprised by the revelation at the end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really fun. It takes 100 floors and makes it even more intense. The frustrating part is when you touch an object that you cannot use. perhaps a hint option could be included for those of us that are not real familiar with this type of game. my wife and I had both our kindle fires going to figure it out. it became friendly competition. looking forward to the next levels.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|would have given 5stars if there would have been some better instructions but once you start playing its not too bad to figure out. keep a pen and paper handy to write down unlocked hints. overall good fun. looking forward to more levels. works great on kindle fire
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Well, Joe Bonamassa IS a guitar god!  Move over Clapton, Vaughn, and Hendrix!  This guy does it all to perfection!  Give this performance a once over and you'll agree!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Little children, lost then found.  This story is beautifully written. The characters are each deeply rendered and unique. The special nature of love in its many forms is the story line.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book gave me hope. She found herself and gave it to us. Dean is the strongest teen boy to walk the pages of a book. Reading this was a roller coaster of emotions. I was high and low. Happy and sad. I was angry and ecstatic. This book has everything u could want. Scream pos dads and praise the one who is selfless. Amazing book
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Light weight and easy to use yet protects the screen.  I love my MicroShell Folio case and would highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|First level was clumsy because I was unsure how to proceed without any instructions on how to navigate but I quickly got the hang of it. I was curious enough on each level to see where the next clue would be, I couldn't stop playing.<br /><br />Only drawback - when the format of clues being given altered I had no idea we went from &quot;look for objects &quot; to &quot;solve riddles&quot; &amp; was perplexed/frustrated especially since there is no Help button. Didn't know I needed a notepad to refer back upon.<br /><br />All in all I do recommend this but I do wish it was a longer game.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|It is like having them live with you and tell their story, and their evolution of those spectacular musicals and song writting.<br /><br />Always looking forward to their ingenuity, and their perfection. They have matured to a level where only a few could ascend.
B0031RSBS2|2.0|I've read a few Jack Reacher novels and I found this one the most unbelievable. Suffice to say the violence is hardly justified and the ending was simply ridiculous. No man just walks away into the sunset after this conclusion.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the game. I got it for free so it was worth the money. It was easy to figure out.
B0045HCIYA|5.0|This movie is really good I didn't think it was going to be all that but I was surprised Demi Moore and Burt Reynolds played very good roles.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I absolutely love this book it might be 500 pages but there's never a dull moment!!!! I recommend this book to all Greek mythology lovers!!!!!!!!!
B000OBYLVO|5.0|One of my go to movies! Cameron is funny, Jude so charming, Kate so sweet and jack is hilarious.  You will laugh and tear up. Enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mine didnt update it self it didnt i had to do it but the game is freaking awesome i play 24/7
0425263916|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK! i could not put it down. I ended up reading it in a day and a half. it was great!! I don't have a problem with it being similar to 50 shades of grey, but after reading the second book. its nothing like 50 shades of grey. I honestly think the crossfire series is a lot better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely adore Downton Abbey and can hardly wait for Season 4, which I want to get as soon as it is available. DA is such a beautifully done period piece and it is so interesting to see the characters work out their roles through the lens of a historical era. DA was recommended to me by an Austrian friend who appreciates the cultural overtones, as I do.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This movie was one that drew you in to see what would happen next.  This makes you feel like you are actually there and are on that ship with the same troubles that they have.  It also brings out the what would realistically happen if we were in a war on the seas.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|I found this book totally engaging. The characters were believable and well-rounded. The writing style held my attention. The ending was refreshingly unpredictable.
B007X4ECLY|5.0|This movie had a good amount of action in it.  It was very interesting all the way through it to the end and the action kept you wondering what would happen next all the time.
B0012GMVVW|5.0|I would describe this 2002 album as very progressive adult contemporary music. It is not really a rock album, although there are elements of rock on some of the tracks. Those who feel that \\"The Next Day\\", Bowie's latest album, is somewhat harsh and unmusical would do well to check this one out. Most of the songs have very tuneful melodies, and the sound, although generally thick and solid, is not as dark and heavy as other modern Bowie albums.<br /><br />Two of the songs could almost be considered Broadway ballads, with impeccable vocals. \\"Sunday\\" sounds like a song from an earlier time, backed by a light techno arrangement, and has a little instrumental surprise at the end. \\"Slip Away\\" begins softly, then develops into a power ballad with a gorgeous melody and a beautiful piano and string arrangement. There are 2 tracks that remind me of past Bowie eras. \\"Cactus\\" is reminiscent of the Ziggy/Hunky Dory sound, and \\"Slow Burn\\", full of excellent rock guitar, sounds like the Berlin era.<br /><br />Tracks 5 through 10 are manifestations of just about every pop/rock genre that exists. \\"Afraid\\" is rather busy, tinged with strings and techno. \\"I've Been Waiting For You\\" sounds a little harder. \\"I Would Be Your Slave\\" is a rather dark, mid-tempo track, again backed by strings and techno. \\"I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship\\" has a sexy \\"talking\\" vocal and a slightly psychedelic arrangement. Sections of \\"5:15 The Angels Have Gone\\" sound like Bruce Springsteen's \\"Philadelphia\\", with a dense, steady synth background. And \\"Everyone Says Hi\\" is the straightest, simplest track on the album: a sentimental pop ballad about someone who \\"moved away\\".<br /><br />Bowie saves the most divergent tracks for last. \\"A Better Future\\" sounds like a bright 80's dance track, with fluid 90's guitar very prevalent. The final track is \\"Heathen (The Rays)\\", an unclassifiable track which morphs through several changes in its short life of 4:16.<br /><br />Unfortunately, printed lyrics are not provided, but lucky for us, they are mostly understandable to the ear. The album includes some strange artwork which evokes the Renaissance, to me anyway.ed, but lucky for us, they are mostly understandable to the ear. The album includes some strange artwork which evokes the Renaissance, to me anyway.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Just need more stages and cars. Try a cause damage stage that gives points for damage caused and maybe add a farthest jump stage.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love playing escape games.  This ap. let.me play whenever I wanted to without having to be online.  The difficulty level of the games was decent
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. I own it on Blu-Ray, and the colors are really vivid. If you like the Wizard of Oz, you'll enjoy this. It explains a lot of the things that you see in the Wizard of Oz.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is so cool I never knew that there was a weapon simulator for world war two<br />AMAZINGLY  AWESOME!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse and it's an awesome game I have a horse of my own and this actually teaches me how to take care of him my actual horses name is sunshoe I had him for a long time
B009YN2M7S|5.0|The best book by Nick I've read so far! Although it may only be the second, it defeats the notebook by a long run. I picked it up after the movie came out in hope that it would die up loose ends. It did exactly that, yet so much more. If you're on the fence about reading this one, I strongly urge you to fall on the side I did and give it a whirl!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game, it is fun and entertaining! My three year old absolutely loves it! I would definitely recommend this game and to top it off it's free!!!! I give it five stars!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I definitely think that the bow needs some adjustments of some sort.But the guide line of the shot is just about right on the money.
0321934946|4.0|This is definetly a must have for all digital photographers  To the point and short tips for all your digital shoots. I find myself skimming throught this book just before I go on any shoot just to make sure I don't forget anything that I might find useful or if I find myself in a situation that's frustrating when I can't get the shot and effect I want. Some tips are just common sense solutions but I did find alot of solutions that I had never thought of before. The only parts I didn''t like in this book ( as well as most of Scotts books) is that a  good amount of space is waisted  with Scott trying to be funny. This waisted space could have been better used to include more tips. Scott is no comedien ( I hope you're reading this Scott). Other then that,a great book and companion for your digital shoots.
B00985E3UG|5.0|It's certainly is a wakeup call to see how the \\"system\\" seems to work against us all. It's disheartening that these firms don't seem to have a moral side to them.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this gameis great for a few reasons first it is not like those cheep games where you cant move around and it has an option where you can play others get it
B000Y90VO2|4.0|Clever satire referencing a bunch of movies from the period when it was filmed. Great movie to bring back memories of past good times.
B004AQR29C|4.0|I really liked the movie.  Its a knock-em, sock-em, blow-em-up, car chase oriented movie with sufficient plot to be interesting.  Its a bit too gory for children but OK otherwise.  The only complaint I have about the movie is that there are some relatively quiet narrative oriented scenes interspersed between several very loud explosive scenes which forces frequent changes with the remote control  but that issue isn't unique to this movie.  Its a common problem with today's action-oriented movies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|An addicting and fun game! You start playing and totally keep going....I'm looking forward to playing level 11 and beyond!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun way to waste some time. I like these types of games. Just keeps me thinking, makes me think. I would recommend just for fun!
1594484805|5.0|I was hesitant to order this book because I wasn't sure I would derive much benefit from it to use as a coach. Boy, was I wrong. The specific examples presented here (both scientific and case studies) were very eye opening. Some of the stories told were great. Although targeted to the business community, there were multiple principals that I took away that I'm going to implement in one form or another.<br /><br />That being said, I didn't agree with everything written. The author makes a point about making your group a \\"no competition\\" zone would be one example. I think that competition works well, even within teams. But, your team must realize that it is not a zero sum game (I win, you lose). Competition drives greatness.<br /><br />Overall, well worth the time and money.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game brings back so many memories of when I was little kid. Puttin change dow the. Slide tryin to win prizes at the fair.....
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Temperance always manages to find clues in the oddest places.  This story is entertaining enough for a light read, beach read or when you don't want to tax your brain too much.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Some levels really stumped me, but not in a frustrating way like some games. There were enough pieces to keep it interesting, and the design overall was great. No bugs that I could tell. Looking forward to more levels!
B001OMJGD0|1.0|Really? Lex wants to destroy the world by creating new real estate and then leasing it back to the US Government? Did we just have a Schumacher Batman moment with Superman? Nipple suits anyone?
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I won't spend a lot of time going on and on about how great this album is. If you're reading any of these reviews, chances are pretty good you've already heard it, so you know what I'm talkin' about. I would just like to give all of you (who are a little reluctant to spend over $100.00 on the \\"Deluxe Edition\\") a quick heads-up about the BestBuy 3CD edition. The third disc in this edition is the same as the third disc contained in the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" of \\"Wings Over America\\" for a fraction of the price. I picked up my copy for only $14.99, and I've gotta say that the third disc isn't really all that good. All you get on this disc are alternate performances of eight songs that are also on the original album. So save your money, and get this BestBuy exclusive edition while you still can. I hope this review has, or will help you to make a wise and fully informed perchase. Thanks for reading it. rock on! Peace!
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I have used this camera bag for two weeks now, and it does the job of protecting my camera. It is a very nice waterproof case for my Canon T3i that can stand on its own when set down. The bottom is a hard-shell material that is very stable. The strap is very nice and sturdy on my shoulder, and it comes with a pad that cushions my shoulder which makes it bearable to carry around all day. It is lightweight alone, and depending on the weight of your camera, will add a few pounds to it, but overall, for me, it is lightweight. I brought this to Niagara falls with me, and the air was humid and water sprayed all over it, but it still came out nicely, not showing any wear. It seems to be waterproof. *not underwater though*** the insides of the bag is adjustable, so you can change the two straps inside that hold the camera if needed. It is a wonderful case that does it job, with three pockets-- one on the front, and two on the sides. Although the side pockets are not big enough to hold my iphone 4s, it does hold batteries and smaller items. I do not regret my purchase.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I am a fan of this R&B star. The maturity of this album keeps his fans from boy band and beyond.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This game is fun to play, but lags a lot on my kindle fire. The screen often freezes up for a few seconds, which is tolerable, considering that the game is free to play. It has good graphics. The game is just &#34;okay&#34;, nothing &#34;wow&#34; about it. I disliked the controls of moving iron man, and it is very hard to earn the blue &#34;cash&#34; that allows you to purchase more lives. It asks that you pay real cash to buy more of these blue things. All in all, it's a fun game, something to kill time with.
0670026638|5.0|Nao, the young Japanese writer of the diary found by Ruth will break your heart several times over during the course of the novel. Nao's grand-uncle Haruki #1 will also grab your sympathies through his diaries, the writings of a conscripted kamikazi pilot on the hardship and brutalities of his military life. If I could give this novel a higher rating than 5, I would.<br /><br />The characters are so real that you easily become involved in their lives and care deeply about what happens to them. Kudos to an outstanding author.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I lost my Kindle fire original cable, so I bought this one instead. It is like the old one. It does the job, slowly charging the kindle fire. :)
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is an awesome story.  I struggled to find the one right thing to say about it, but I think No more Excuses works.  Whether it was the father doing whatever it takes to provide for his kids or parents doing the difficult to see their son out of a death spiral or a wife demonstrating true leadership or a warrior putting the team first or a daughter singing this family does not allow anyone to claim impossible.  So if you are prone to whining and looking for a way out, don't read this book.  If you want to read an incredible tale about the real heroes of America, then here you go.  Oh yeah, it will make you cry.
0061969656|5.0|Lots of action, history and some romance for the ladies.  A winning combination.<br /><br />I have read all of the Saxon Tales by Bernard Cornwell.  I read them in order and I enjoyed them all.  I think it would be hard for a new reader to start with Death of Kings and really understand the book 100%.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, It would be best to start with the first book and read them in order.  The characters in Death of Kings are fuller, deeper, and more interesting if you know where they have come from.<br /><br />Another thing I like about the Saxon Tales are that some of the characters are non-fiction, they really lived.  I have an appreciation for Alfred the Great now, and had I never read these fine books he would have been lost to me.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like it and I look he new look. I use it every day and I will recommend it to all my friends.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is ... EPIC!!! I love it with all new blades back rounds and UPGRADES no wonider so many people love it I'd recommend getting it
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Tom cruise is NOT  Reacher! Have read all Lee Child's books, and Cruise is an insult to the character!!! The Chase scene was funny considering Reacher is a lousy driver!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great. game awesome to play I am literally getting hooked I find myself not being able to stop playing even though the game can get hard at times.
B00012QLQ4|4.0|The item was an unopened DVD and the DVD disk was in perfect condition. The reason I did not give them 5 out of 5 stares is in their comments they said the item was like new and no mention of damage to the box but there was some damage to the DVD box. The damage was light.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The soap opera story line by Julian Fellowes is redeemed by great acting, gorgeous cinematography in sterling British locations.<br />Fellowes is a genius when it comes to surprising his readers and, in this case, viewers.  For those who wish to explore Fellowes as an author, do read &#34;Past Imperfect&#34;.
B004I744AS|5.0|what an online dictionary should be. Accurate and user friendly. Thank you Farlex for providing this fantastic app for my Kindle fire HD.
147674355X|4.0|I enjoyed this book, however I thought it was going to be a light fluffy romance novel and instead it was a book about *spoilers* sexual abuse.  I would still recommend this however.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love all the games G 5 creates. They are fun, never boring, great graphics and I like the idea that I can play for free for a while to decide if I want to finish the game. Even the high end games ($5) are worth it. I pass the games on to my 8 year old granddaughter and I have to literally take the kindle away to get her to do something else. At least I feel like she is using her brain and far better than some of the garbage on TV.  Thanks for the entertainment guys, keep the sequels coming!  NANA
B00C7JFIRC|4.0|Movie was good Disney is hard to o wrong might be scary for kids under 9 the monkeys alittle scary
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Adventure, love and horror all mixed together= Hunger Games. Couldn't stop reading this. So interesting and breathtaking, it's unexplainable! Totally recommend it to anyone. Also very inspiring and thoughtful. Best book I've read in ages!!!!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I upgraded form a Sandybridge i5 that I was having some trouble with, and I knew the improvement would be incremental going in. The core is everything I expected, high quality, high speed, overclock ready, and for games, a better value then an i7.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I am a Baldacci fan and this is one that adds to that love.  Will Robie is a man of contradictions and change something that adds to the story.  When reading a book like this I do not want to get part way through and know the answer and this did hold up.  Julie definitely touched him in a place that Will did not know that he had.  The twists and turns are always a surprise but lead to a good conclusion.  I convinced my husband to give this a try, although we do not usually agree on the books we read.  He is now reading other books that David Baldacci has written.  I am now reading the follow-up book and enjoying it as well
B00A429YF6|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen. Great acting, wonderful story and great ending. I want to watch it again
0307596885|4.0|Munro has indicated that this may be her last book - if so, we are losing a peerless short story author. I have read several volumes of Munro's stories, and she never disappoints. She has a clear, understated style of writing that is restful but never dull. So many phrases and sentences should stick in your memory:<br /><br />\\"He was evidently the sort of person who posed questions that were traps for you to fall into.\\"<br /><br />\\"I never questioned what I believed had been shown to me - I just believed it easily - until one day, one day I knew with a dim sort of hole in my insides that now I didn't believe it anymore.\\"<br /><br />\\"If you live long enough as a parent nowadays, you discover that you have made mistakes you didn't bother to know about along with the ones you do know about all too well.\\"<br /><br />\\"We say of some things that they can't be forgiven, or that we will never forgive ourselves. But we do - we do it all the time.\\"<br /><br />If I had to choose a favorite in this collection, I think it would be \\"Amundsen,\\" - it's a story whose ending makes your heart so sad. \\"In Sight of the Lake,\\" leaves you with a sense of dread that it could happen to you. \\"Train,\\" displays the unexplainable reactions that we have to random conversations and the life-changing actions that they may prompt.<br /><br />Another completely satisfying volume by a quietly remarkable author.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I liked the story line because I'm fascinated  about the holocaust in general but then<br />I found out it wasn't a true story but a novel.  I didn't like the ending too much either but in<br />general it was good reading
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Friend has this game and I decided to try it.  Very fun and makes your brain work.  Give it a try
1423140591|5.0|Riordan doesn't disappoint and his stories don't get stale or overworked. Each is new and exciting and his characters are endearing, even the bad ones.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Best in its price range, for power and utility. Either go this or Haswell, X79 is a waste for non workstation setups even for gaming its a waste..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you think -  but not impossible. Puzzles and investigating combine to create a workout for the brain. Can't wait for more rooms!
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|I mentioned I was disappointed in Lagoona from the series but not here Howleen looks amazing. The wild paw print dress looks great although I admit it does seem a bit 80's like some have said but I say so what? I grew up in the 80's and yeah, we had style extreme. The beanie she wears is a nice touch and not something I thought I would like but actually do. Love how her ears poke out through it. Her lipstick and hair is done in Hot Pink and I love it. Makes me want to color my hair hot pink. She also wears knee high boots and comes with her pet \\"Cushion\\" Clawdeen better watch out. Her little sister is definitely going to be stealing lots of attention.
B005COO1X6|4.0|A lot of people harken back to ´Christine´ and mention 'From A Buick 8' when reviewing this story. I don't see he point in comparing since there really IS no comparison.  Steven King just seems to like making cars into demons and, as he did with \\"Buick 8\\", he may be tying this car into the \\"Dark Tower\\" world.<br />In any case, this wad a great read to end the night with. Enjoy it!
B00CEQ1HQE|3.0|Lagoons gets a makeover in this version. Teenage girls often changes, be it fashion of there clothes or hair but one normally does not change the color of one's skin unless your Mitt Romney trying to get some votes. It failed for Mitt and I have to say it fails here for Lagoona. She is still a pretty doll so I had to grab her along with the rest of the series when I saw her at Toys R' Us but I really thought it was Abby when I first looked at her. The dress is a simple checkered type pattern with another shimmery piece over it. Looks good but not great as compared to the Howleen doll in this series which they did an amazing job on. Lagoona also has some fins on her legs and arms which I find to be a very nice touch along with the webbing on her hands. I like the way they did it much better than say my Dot Dead Gorgeous Lagoona. Also this version does not seem to be wearing lipstick and there is a bit more yellow in her eyes than the other series. This is a pretty doll. I do not want it to sound like I am displeased with it, but is different from what I was expecting, and all in all is my least favorite doll of the 22 in my Monster High Collection however if your like me and want the set you will be wanting her never the less.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Tried the app that comes up for Kindle Fire. Have tried twice and no pictures show. If, as one review suggested, there's an actual Kindle Fire app that's 50 slots down, it's ridiculous. Amazon should be able to list its  apps in order related to request instead of a bunch of stupid games that don't march request
0525425772|5.0|I love to read a John Grisham book whenever I have a moment to relax.  these take you back in time with some of the same characters.
0470913029|5.0|What I expected, helpful and interesting, we have been following this eating pattern and find it works! Good companion to Primal Body Primal Mind which we read first.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I usually only listen to 80's Heavy Metal and Thrash Metal like Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Metallica, Judas Priest and all that good Metal stuff and i hate modern 2000's heavy metal, but Avenged Sevenfold. Avenged Sevenfold is different, its the only modern metal band i like. And this album is really good. Its showed me the modern hero's of metal are doing great to carry on the name.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Although BCG (before computer graphics) storey line was great Roddenbury. Thoughtful and sensitive about humans and other species. Love seeing Shatner and Nimoy as what they should still look like!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie first but still enjoyed this immensely. The book, of course, filled in a number of gaps but i have to admit I was a little surprised how I intensely it was focused just on Katniss' experience. I was expecting more story about people and events in the capitol and managing the game especially.
B007XNTDPA|4.0|I have read everything this guy has written (I think). He went through a spell where they got<br />a bit too similar then he took hold of his skills and took off. His style has broadened and<br />almost anything he writes is very, very readable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very good game. It's also very puzzling, but in a good way. You have to be berry observant to play
0786956291|5.0|I think the mr higbee's statement that 'you don't need the core rules' should be revised to something more of you needn't worry about them early on. you may want them as you get more involved.<br /><br />the fact is the products were designed as stepping stones: first this starter, then the essentials, finally the hard core stuff (and yes you will want the hardcovers if you are to have any edge in this game be you PC or DM)<br /><br />I also recommend 'players strategy guide' for a tactics -how to- and the 'DnD 4e/DM-for dummies' to get you on the right track to 'power gaming'<br /><br />also wizards character record sheets for 4e while being sparse give you enough blank power cards for one PC so you can add-on powers from other sources such as essentials or core products.<br /><br />and I recommend you picking a campaign setting if you are a newer DM they give you options for adventure ideas when you aren't experienced enough to build your own, plus you can grab elements to add to your own worlds or creation.<br /><br />finally if you feel too intimidated when deciding products or want to add flavor without a hefty price tag then try dnd insider at [...]  the forums will help you make all the right calls and the $5.95/mo subscription gives you cool tools and tons of game product dirt cheap.<br /><br />good luck all you fledgling gamers and game on
B00CWY76CC|5.0|easy, yet not too easy. Great time killer. I play on a train to work when not in a mood for reading. Fun for all ages. my nice who is 9 loves it.
1476734941|5.0|So good that I am ordering another copy for a friend! It will make his journey easier. So order a copy today!
3836538725|5.0|How lucky fore us Sebastiao Salgado took his vision of Genesis and produced this remarkable book.  This was truly a Herculean endeavor and as Salgado says the greatest experience of my life.  That he got to share this with his wife who beautifully designed this book and his son who filmed it's creation only adds to the richness of his experience.  Bravo to share with us your beautiful vision and imagery, your hard work and dedication to produce a book that is inspiring with each turn of the page.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game takes me back to when I was four years old asking if I could play on my grandma's computer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best drama since. . . a very long time! Worth watching just for the Maggie Smith one liners. The acting is surperb, the story captivating. Anxiously awaiting the next season.
B0042QB2Q4|1.0|The ratings were bad when the film premiered and now I know why. It is terrible and I cannot believe I wasted $4 on this. I could have bought McNuggets with that money. Those are McNuggets I'm never gonna get back.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|Holds you all the way to the end, great twists and turns when least expected-well worth the time.  Enjoy the ride!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|A little bit of patience, gives a great lot of fun.  The Facebook login is a bit wonky, but beyond that I love it!
B00C04H2VO|3.0|why pay more here when you can but it at toys r us for $24.99? don't make sense when you can get it for a lot cheaper at toys r us.
B002HFWAL8|5.0|This is one of the best stories/movies I think dealing with translife and love even if not everyone would agree.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series and wish Sylvia could write faster. I want to read about the Cross' forever.. sad it ended!!!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This movie is the best, Our 8 month old son can watch it from the beginning to the end everyday. Rio is the best babysitter we have. He is actually watching it right now. I would recommend this movie to anybody who has a young child. thank you for the speedy delivery, it was a day earlier than expected. keep up the good work and thank you again for the babysitter.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|The filters and photo effects are cool. The features are laid out logically and are easy to use. High quality app and totally worth the money.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|What an enjoyable read. Don is so quirky and likeable. I loved every chapter and didn't want the story to end. This novel was fun, light, bright and thoroughly entertaining.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this app. The difficulty slider bar for the computer skill level seems to be very accurate.
B00B125QRS|4.0|This is a great box set for any Roth-Era VH fan.... The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of the lack of any extras or bonus material. It's just a straight forward set of all the original albums. If you already own them all individually then you needn't buy this. But if you are missing a few, this is the way to go.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Ok so any app you get it should be from Imangi Studios, LLC that is the company it  was made from and I have memorized it because I LOVE this game!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book made me cry over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Heartbreaking. Life can give you difficult moments.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|I love epic fantasy or unique magic systems with multiple books as Brandon Sanderson does so well. I had great hopes for this series but alas, after book one, I won't be buying any more in the series. Maybe it is just that urban fantasy seems to miss the point, but I think it is the way he tries to throw in every fantasy creature/demon/nightmare character from vampires to werewolves, witches et al.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|a few girls at work play too. we all.play together at lunch and have a blast! I cant wait for more rooms
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a good app.I like it and would recommend it to anyone  with kids /children. I have no complaints
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a fun game and does get more challenging the more you play it.<br />A good way to burn some time.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I only got this game to see what the hype was :-) It is not my kind of game, but can see where kids would enjoy it.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Its like the other Angry Birds, fun to play with several different levels to play. I do like that you can practice using the power ups to better your skills.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun figuring out the puzzles, but there are only ten levels right now. Can't wait for an update with more levels.  I like how you can revisit any completed level.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I've become addicted. If you want a funky spin on temple run, this is your game!with new themes and characters each month, it never gets boring!
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I love this game on my other devices but on my Kindle fire HD music will not play and it will not link to my Facebook get an error then it freezes up please fix
B0091REZMW|3.0|Its cool but it could be better . I think that some things have to have a better limit or be something like another game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and very addictive!  It's challenging but not too difficult. I've only played a few levels so far but I am really enjoying the game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a good game it makes you think but it's not too hard to solve . It's one of the better escape games out there
B0062NAX1U|4.0|I Message in this movie is formidable. This is a message for all men! I rated it as I did , because of the of the slightly inept acting abilities in some of the characters! I will highly recommend and will purchase more in the near future!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I love it because it is so cool and it feels like your styling your you or bff so tis really cool
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I've had this game in my iPad for months. Now it's on my Kindle. I highly recommend it for hours of fun.
B000QE1U9K|4.0|trying to re-watch all the Alien movies...so far, have enjoyed the trip down memory lane! Would recommend the journey for all Alien fans
0679805273|5.0|This book is great for all ages.  Plus it has a wonderful moral in it.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B003L77GG0|5.0|This was truly a great season, the greatest season in my opinion.  What better way to start off Superman's career than this?  Of all the origin stories out there, I find this show has done it the best thus far.  Throughout all the seasons there were some definite misses (as nothing will ever be perfect, especially the vampire bat episode), but I think Tom Welling's version of Clark hit the nail on the head.  He was able to play Clark as the vulnerable guy wrestling with his &#34;human&#34; emotions in a modern world (which we love to see, e.g., &#34;Year One,&#34; etc.), yet also able to give us the &#34;mask&#34; Clark, with the stumbling, bumbling, clumsy act - which I find a lot of the newer origin stories disappointingly lack.  One of my favorite scenes is Clark being nervous and asking for the bathroom due to a milkshake he had earlier -- CLASSIC!  He also was totally against killing, unlike the &#34;Man of Steel&#34; movie (which I found to be a completely disappointing move by the screenwriters of the movie).  The writers of &#34;Smallville&#34; definitely gave us the best of both pre-Crisis and post-Crisis Superman origins. The rest of the cast and plots are great too, especially the V.R.A subplot.  SUPER-COOL.  Loved Green Arrow.  Loved Hawkman.  Loved the &#34;Earth 2&#34; plots.  Loved Lois Lane.  Chloe rocked!  Lex, Lionel, Tess... It's all there!<br /><br />As you can tell, I'm a fan.  I definitely recommend this season as well as any other &#34;Smallville&#34; season.<br /><br />I'm also glad they continued the story with the Season 11 comics/graphic novels...
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is really fun to play when I don't having anything to do. It pretty entertaining, and a great way to pass the time.
1853261580|5.0|The shipping was more expensive than the book! That's how cheap it is. It may not be in color, but all the info is still there. 5/5 stars!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|As others have noted, this app cannot be installed on the first generation Kindle Fire.  Strange that it is being offered in the Kindle appstore.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm happy to see this is made into a movie and I'm anxious to see it.  I hope the movie is as good as the book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great fun ! Got hooked from the beginning. I felt I was sitting next to mom in the court room . And it's unpredictable.the story line Is real and controversial.  Enjoy and then you will think awhile.
B004OC07GM|5.0|There is not a lot to day other than you need to read this if you manage a technical product firm.
B00571F26Y|5.0|As a result of the Davis' book, I have gone wheat and gluten free.  This has brought about a better quality of life for me.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After all the delays and hype for the third book of this series, this was a total let down!  There was no conclusion to the story, as expected, just a wise ass statement by the author implying more to come.  If the plan was for 4 or 5 books, just say so, so the readers can decide if they are willing to invest the time and long waits between books.  This is not the way to win friends and influence people.  I'm done with Sylvia Day!
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|Compared to previous generations of the product, this is a reliable, high quality product that perfectly suits my purpose of soothing the boredom of swimming countless laps.<br />It is easy to set up, transferring songs takes reasonable effort and the sound quality(while head is immersed) and battery life are remarkable. I feel it is a bit overpriced and that is why I do not give it 5 stars.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Great movie..don't make em like this anymore!  I liked the acting with Humphrey Bogart and others. a must see! Greatness!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter is a my little pony fan and she love this game if easy and fun for a ages
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Liked it. Showed how England evolved in their way of life from one age to the next. A good history
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the game was quite addicting, every time I went to put it down I stopped for one more room. too bad there aren't more levels but there are more coming. I have a kindle fire so I don't know what everyone else is complaining about unless they're low on space or they didn't let it download before disconnecting from Internet.
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci never disappoints.  This book was heard to put down and as always you never know where it is going to end up.  There is no way I can figure out what the end is going to look like in all of his work.  This one does not disappoint.  If you love Baldacci, you will love this one too.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|App works fine, just don't like the ads. Interface was fine, would have pestered being able to change the dull colors.
B007IK44CK|4.0|After the original &#34;Mission Impossible,&#34; this is my favorite.  Great action, great scenery, and a great plot make this movie work.  The actors all do a fine job as well.  Definitely worth watching.
B001B6EAOY|4.0|I know these are the best made devices as I am paying less than $5 for an adapter so it can't be made of the greatest quality. Anyway here is my list of pros and cons<br />Pro:<br />- More memory for less<br />- Faster read/write than the MS Duo<br />- Upgradeable to have up to 32 GB on the Phat PSP<br />Cons:<br />- Breaks easily? Yes that is a question mark as it breaks after removing the thing weekly/daily to get more games/plugins on it after about a year. I mean for $5 a year I am ok with that but it shouldn't be breaking just because I &#34;moved it&#34;
B002APU580|5.0|Beautiful! Enchanting! I adore this version of a favorite story! I have watched it over and over and never tire of it. Highly recommended!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i love this game it can keep me occupied for hours but you need to update on android and kindle to the version on ios with the wave rider other than that the ga<br />me is fantastic
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have only been playing for about a week but it is so much fun. Still trying to learn how to share items with others.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very thought-provoking without being so difficult that you don't want to play.  I'm already anticipating more rooms, and I'm hoping they're just as mind-numbing!!!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Okay but not as funny as his other books. If you laugh a lot then this could be a good book. It wasn't boring but just not as funny as i expected it to be.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|It's not that surprising Iron Maiden has another new dvd seeing as they put one out every couple of years. That's more often than when they put out a new studio album. The question that I think people ask is \\"is it worth it?\\" Yes and no. It all depends on you. Do you like your Maiden classic or more modern? Do you like watching Maiden perform on stage? Do you like seeing them on tour? How about watching vintage footage from the 80's? There's many variables and many questions that you have to ask yourself. In the case of Maiden England '88, a re-release of the VHS from 1989, these questions apply. The dvd coincides with the band's current Maiden England World Tour. It features remastered audio along with three unreleased encores. The original Martin Burch stereo mix is accompanied by new 5.1 mixes and stereo mixes for the encores from Kevin \\"Caveman\\" Shirley, just like on the Live After Death dvd. This is one of the best sounding live releases they have. It warrants buying the cd version as well. One of the best features is The History Of Iron Maiden - Part 3 which continues from where part 2 left off, and focuses on Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, and the tours that followed each album. Also included is the previously out-of-printed 12 Wasted Years, and the music videos from Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. Having recently made a full transition into Blu-Ray, this was my first dvd in a year. Since Maiden's last two videos Flight 666 and En Vivo! were both released on Blu-Ray, I had imagined they'd have one for this. Sadly, no. That didn't stop me from picking this up, but I hope the next one is a Blu-Ray.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is  great game with great graphics. I would definitely recommend this game. This game helps engage young kids with its interactive missions and compositions involving a realistic horse.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|I'm surprised at all the negativity towards Surtur Rising. I always liked that one has much as Twilight Of The Thunder God and With Oden On Our Side (all produced by Jens Bogren!), but to be honest, I like just about every album they've ever done. Does that mean that they can do no wrong? Not exactly. If anything, I feel that Fate Of Norns was pretty bland when I first listened to it. I don't dislike it though. Deceiver Of The Gods sees the band changing producers, which is nothing new. I guess that they were feeling too comfortable working with the same guy. Hypocrisy frontman Peter Tägtgren produced the first three albums, Berno Paulsson did Versus The World and Fate Of Norns, and Jens Bogren did the last three. Andy Sneap (Megadeth, Testament, Kreator, Exodus) was chosen to produce the new album. Given the style of production and mixing/mastering done by Andy, it seems to fit with Amon Amarth's music. In a recent review I did for Killswitch Engage's new album Disarm The Dissent, I noted that there has been some naysay towards Andy over his mixing/mastering. More comments have arisen, but trust me. Just about everything he's touched is solid metal. Don't believe it? Listen to this album.<br /><br />Also look out for the new Carcass album, which was also mixed by Andy Sneap.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|I like it without commercials. It keeps you interested from episode to episode.<br />The acting is superior and I like how there is usually some twist at the end.
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|I'm a huge Kevin Spacey fan and therefore assume anything he's in will be good.  Overall the movie was good, though some scenes were predictable and this storyline has been seen many times before, it still kept me interested. With the exception of the boy genius, I thought the acting quality was great.  I can't say I loved the ending but I guess that's subjective.  Good movie, good actors, would recommend.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I didn't think this movie was going to be as good as it turned out. It was a very good combination of futuristic and savage. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who liked the Avengers movie.... good flic!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I would recommend this book to all ages because of its thrilling adventure and action. I gave this book a four because the writing could have been better. Even though I loved how the plot was, I think the writing could have been better. Overall I would recommend this for joy reading but not for anyone older then seventh grade if you are trying to improve your reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved so much it was so fun would play all day if I could and the funny thing is that most of my family's plates this so lol wanna play some more
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|This is a great old fashioned movie. A nice light thriller. We watched it with our kids for a movie night the adults could love that wouldn't scare the kids half to death.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun game kids and I love playing together. Can't but it down. Thanks for a good free game can't wait for more.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Not that I was surprised but I LOVED this book and.....*spoiler alert*....glad to know that the series isnt over!  I LOVE Gideon and Eva and the whole story around the two.  Definitely a must read, if you have read the first two of this series already.
0142000671|5.0|\\"Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had been. `Gosh, she was purty.' He smiled admiringly. George looked quickly down at him and then he took him by an ear and shook him. `Listen to me, you crazy bastard,' he said fiercely. `Don't you even take a look ... I don't care what she says and what she does. I seen `em poison before, but I never seen no piece of jail bait worse than her. You leave her be.'\\"<br /><br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" begins with two men walking along the Salinas River and ends with two men walking along the Salinas River and in between we are transported to a distant world dominated by the Great Depression, by two migrant workers whose American Dream has been repeatedly shattered by the economic downfall. It is a world where mental illness had not yet been understood and is Shakespearean in mood: From the initial steps along the river and the first words uttered by George to Lenny and the foreshadowing that follows at the farm, we know the story ends badly. We can see Lenny's big hands and George's lips flapping, warning while they imagined better times, of living off the land where Lenny can tend his rabbits and George can farm in peace with Candy and Crooks.<br /><br />The bottom line: \\"Of Mice and Men\\" isn't always an easy read. Its language is of an era that is foreign to many Americans, racist at times, harsh or filled with vile slang at others (see above). But with limited pages of a novella, Mr. Steinbeck finely draws the characters that populate this world in such a way that you can't help but be transported to their lives, to their struggle. You'll hate Curley and his wife and you'll sympathize with the rest, especially Lennie Small and George Milton as they descend to an inevitably depressing conclusion.<br /><br />-Raeden Zen
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I decided to give this book a &#34;go&#34; after seeing the film of the same title starring the sultry Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DeNiro and Bradley Cooper.  It follows the film to a T for the most part and I'm glad I read it.  However, it was a little unrealistic that Bradley Cooper's character can exercise as much as he does in the book.  It is said that he runs 15 miles per day which is just crazy.  I know a girl who runs 8 and I consider that above the norm.  15 miles is probably more than I drive per day!  Lol.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING UNEXPECTED.  THE CHARACTERS ARE SO GOOD AND THEY CONSTANTLY ARE GROWING IN THEIR ROLES.  WONDERFUL ENTERTAINMENT.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wanted to know what was all the fuss about. In the beginning I thought that the BDSM was going to be too much for me, but it's not so. Or I got used to it.<br />I enjoyed the first two books, but the third one was unecessary really. Sometimes I felt like Anastasia knew so little about what surrounded her, and she didn't even care most of the time, until it (anything) happened.<br />Last, I have to say that I was VERY disappointed when I read that this story was based on Twilight, because I red the whole series and was a fan at that time. But with that in mind, there are MANY similarirties between the two series, and I don't like that. I undestand that E.L. James expanded the idea and took it to another level, but in the end, I could feel the resemblance even in the characters feelings and behaviour.<br />I hope this helps! ;)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Its good simply riten anb easy to follow.  It gives us an idea of how the world would be like under the new world order. I do highly recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|wish we would have known that there could be a 4th 5th book. this definitely would not have been disappointed.,and I didnt like how they pushed back the release for this book by three times.<br />just very disappointed.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Pretty much a home or studio headphone. Cant imagine anyone wanting to travel with these. I equalized a little more lower mid and a little less lower treble. Amazing top to bottom transparency & dynamics. Realistic voices and instruments in a natural acoustic. Works well with amps that can swing more current: like tubes. Good resolution but the pricier Somic is even more believable in presenting musical events.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Please don't die before the last book is finished George. Can not wait to see what happens in the next book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was very large to download and more expensive than most. This was all because of the graphics. They're impressive, but the puzzles and HO minigames are not challenging. Storyline was good and thought extra chapter at the end was a nice finishing touch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game is very entertaining and I enjoy it very much.  I will recommend it to everyone, it keeps my mind occupied.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Puzzles were not too challenging, realistic in intent and kept you interested. A lot of these types are glitchy and the puzzles are impossible because the answers are not logical. This one worked well.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love this series, not sure if each series is just 4 chapters, that is the only thing that is available, if they were more I will love to see them, very, very interesting.
B0044WUIHA|5.0|Had to share this amazing film with my 14 year old. She loved it, as I knew she would! Tom Hanks is my all time favorite!
B0059WTMLW|3.0|Its OK but not great. A little boring for me and doesn't hold my interest. Should try it out before you buy it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I found this book a bit hard to follow and not as breathtaking as Husseini's other two books, but still a good read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome writing. It is comparable with the 50 Shades of Grey series, but is probably better written with more of a background.  Well worth buying!
B005938780|4.0|Although imo, Maiden's first three albums: Self Titled, Killers, and The Number of The Beast were my favorites but Somewhere in Time has alot of great songs like Deja Vu, Alexander The Great, Wasted Years, and one of my personal Maiden faves Stranger In A Strange Land. The title cut is also classic. These guys' albums have aged alot better than say, alot of the more mainstream \\"hair metal\\" sound albums. Bruce Dickinson is a cool cat. Met him when Maiden played the concert to support this album at the Sportatorium. Good times.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This seems like a book written for children, by a child. Things in it make no rhyme or reason most of the time. The main character is either instantly hated, or instantly adored by everyone he meets without cause. The spelling and grammar are atrocious. Expect to see a TON of &#34;site&#34; instead of &#34;sight&#34;, &#34;waist&#34; instead of &#34;waste&#34;, &#34;would&#34; instead of &#34;wood&#34; and even non-words like &#34;freezed&#34; instead of &#34;Froze&#34;. There is also frequent redundancy, such as &#34;he stood there speechless, unable to speak.&#34;  Also the writer has put very little effort into research. Often using the wrong words for things,such as &#34;cask&#34; instead of &#34;flagon&#34; and having the characters learn things nearly instantly that should take months if not years of training for no other reason than it was convenient.<br /><br />I could go on about the flaws, but those were the glaring problems I saw from chapters 1-16. That being said, the story is quite imaginative, and I can see it thoroughly capturing the minds of young readers, and entertaining them. Sadly, with all the errors, I wouldn't suggest letting children read it. Some will find this harsh to say, but, the truth is that young people often pick up language and writing skills from reading books. When books are published, they go through rigorous editing processes to polish and perfect them, and it is rare to see a mistake or two in a published book. Self publishing lacks these qualities, and reading such continuous flaws can teach children bad grammar. For example, since there are so many instances of the spelling &#34;site&#34; is being used where the spelling should be &#34;sight&#34; I would not be at all surprised if a young reader who didn't know the difference picked up on that bad habit. I think if its a book you're going to read to your children, it's definitely got a lot of entertainment value to offer, just be sure to be cautious letting them read it on their own.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, the story is imaginative enough that with some research to correct the major flaws, and with a little more time taken to develop the characters, I don't see why this couldn't be published. I encourage the author to consider that route.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|First off, before I get attacked, NO, I'm not a racist white dude...I am white, but not a racist...I BOUGHT \\"Yeezus\\" because of the 5-star reviews it got, and the comparisons to cool industrial artists Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, with a bit of the \\"808's\\" style thrown in (I dug the singles from that record and the style)...Kanye IS a talented guy and he gets slammed in the press constantly, most notably for his involvement with Kim K and their daughter North...I always side with the underdog...and I did think he was a bit of a jackass the way he treated Taylor Swift rudely on that awards ahow...I sided with Taylor on that one but moved on.<br /><br />So I bought \\"Yeezus\\" thinking it would be this cool punk-rap record...I popped it on and it's very extreme...very noisy...I LOVE noise!!  One of the best bands ever is Dublin, Ireland-based My Bloody Valentine, who are definitely the loudest, and leader Kevin Shields is a studio genius...the big problem with \\"Yeezus\\" is lack of melody...I found slim pickings of catchy hooks and lack of compelling songstructures...nothing that compelled me to turn it up even louder or get into a beat or want to dance, nothing!!  If anything, it made me want to turn it down and skip from track to track...a coupla tracks were OK, and I did not find the lyrics fun or funny or smart, just obnoxious and mean...all I got was \\"Gimme my damn croissants!!\\"<br /><br />So, the intentions of \\"Yeezus\\" completely backfired on me...not what I was expecting at all...and I thought it would be more than 10 tracks...one person who heard it said it was 10 tracks but also a bunch of remixes too, nope!!  I gave the album 2 stars because Kanye did put some art into this...but noise without melody or anything compelling just grates on my nerves, and rarely anything does but bad music...I'm not saying \\"Yeezus\\" is BAD, just not my taste...<br /><br />Sorry, Kanye and everyone here...I did give it a try because I wanted to and it piqued my curiosity...I don't trash just for the sake of trashing...I have better uses of my time...n't trash just for the sake of trashing...I have better uses of my time...
B004LWZW9C|4.0|I got this movie because it's the same team that put together Valentine's Day.  I enjoyed it, just not as much as their previous work.  Most of the actors did a good job.  Nothing earth-shattering was explored, but it's just a fluff movie so I wasn't expecting the movie to solve the world's problems for me.
B002L5KKK2|5.0|Beautiful story about the loves of the lives of minority's and the struggles of the 60's with racism and poverty.
B00164KYV4|5.0|I used to hate ensemble movies.  Then I saw Love, Actually.  So when this came out I decided to give it a chance.  I'm happy to say that it has become one of my top 5 fluff movies to watch.  I really do love this movie.  Well written, well directed, well acted...well well well!
0425256162|3.0|Where this book ends, others written by Reynolds usually start. This might have been a nice short story, a prequel to an existing storyline, however, it is a full-length novel and it drags. Reynolds stated that with this book, or series, he wanted to depart from his usual epic dark and sometimes violent space opera style (in which he succeeded) and rather paint an optimistic version of the future in Arthur C. Clarke's style (where he failed). There is no drama in the book, you read it hoping that there will be some plot twist waiting for you on just the next page but no.<br /><br />The main characters (who I don't even know how they look - I don't think their appearance is described anywhere in the book) decided to turn their back on their wealthy and important family to follow some improbable and haphazardly placed clues all over the solar system. The point is, there is no point. Their motivation being they don't spite the family enough and they want some excitement in their lives. After several close shaves, lucky escapes, other improbable occurences and unnecessary plot elements (unnecessary at least to the plot of this book) and 450 pages of family squabbles the main characters finally arrive at their destination (which the first clue could have easily pointed to, no need to have flown around the solar system) and the reason for their journey is revealed.<br /><br />It is an OK book. As a Reynolds fan I expected the usual awesome 5-star book and was sorely disappointed. For others it might be fine, I feel let down, especially as I know Reynolds can write so much better.
B000EZ7ZYA|5.0|I seriously adore Will Smith.  But Kevin James totally steals every scene.  Great acting, directing, writing and editing.  Super perfectly paced film and fun fluff.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It is a book to re-read often and refer to others.  It is definitely a life provoker and changer.  Thanks for the life challenge.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The stories and writing, in general, are what keeps<br />this at a high level of entertainment.  I need four<br />more words.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun and not extremely hard to figure out. I'm an adult who doesn't play a lot of games, but I found it easy to play.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I love Michael Connelly.  I love the Harry Bosch novels.  I love it when they interact with the Lincoln Lawyer.
1609611543|2.0|Save your money.  You can get the exact same advice and information from magazines and the internet.  Nothing new so don't waste your time.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|Well Lee, you've done it again! Once I put the thought of Tom Cruise pretending to be 6'4inches; and 200lbs; I became engrossed in this great kidnap yarn. Thoroughly recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watch season 1 and 2 on Netflix and purchased season 3 on Amazon. It's all about the social activity betweeen humans in distress and how it chages us for the better or worse and the unpredictibility of the actions in certain scenerios. Surprising how a moive about zombies can really be a movie about poeple. I can't wait  until next season I absolutely love this series...  However,,, the end of season 3 not as exciting as the rest, as the &#34;Mayor&#34; scenes are kind of mudame and drawn out. I love this series though!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|OK, already... I never gave it a chance, totally dismissed it when it was on television. Like some others on this list, fell in love with the Walton Coggins character in &#34;Justified&#34;. Found out he had a leading role on &#34;The Shield&#34;, so had to check it out. I'm now a Fan... half way through the 1st season and totally loving it!!! As a long time Film fan, ex-theatre manager/showman, now freelance video and independent film producer... I refuse to watch any show with little or no substance. &#34;The Shield&#34; has all the aspects contained in a very successful series... great production value, writing, acting, directing, editing, etc. The characters are well developed as is the story line, delving into and addressing matters that address us all in this day and time. The show just grows on me and I can't wait to watch the next episode. Sorry cast and crew for initially dismissing this great show... I'm now one of your absolute 'BESTEST' Fans!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Paid for this for streaming on home tv, but was soooo boring could not force myself to watch past 10 minutes. Halle Berry, Tom Hanks, and a host of other A list actors..There must have been a bonified Idiot someone able to pull off a unwatchable movie with somany great actresses and actors in it; getting paid at the expense of debiting from the credibility of the actors and actresses for future viewing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Again, this series does not disappoint. Season ended with a shocker.... no I won't spoil it for you, you have to watch to believe.......
B001XV09UG|1.0|What a terrible production. A waste of film. No wonder they split. I wouldn't walk across the street again to see this disaster even if it was offered free of charge.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Very solid game. Worth the price of admission. Would recommend to those looking to get into Magic. Online is fun.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Daughters love this and if they like it this pparent is happy. Thank you for the speedy delivery and more order to come.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I read all of Vince Flynns books and have enjoyed every one of them. His ability to forsee and capture true to life situations in his political views was outstanding. The only problem that I had with this book was putting it down. Vince will be truely missed by this reader.

B005SEYOXW|5.0|This was an excellent science fiction series that, like Star Trek in the 60's, was canceled prematurely - Firefly even worse with only one precious season to view over and over again.<br /><br />Love anything Josh Whedon does.<br /><br />I think Whedon's Firefly view of us in the future is, unfortunately, a more likely reality than Star Trek's view:<br /><br />We've headed off into space (not to explore as a unified earth with a prime directive of non-interference, but to occupy and expand our resource-guzzling footprint with the all of best and the worst of us in tow);<br /><br />we're all speaking Chinese (or at least cursing in it);<br /><br />there are still malevolent, power-hungry, greedy humans wanting to control everyone and everything in space through a corporately-controlled government [sound familiar - sans the space of course?]};<br /><br />there are those who fight that evil and fail;<br /><br />and finally, amidst all the turmoil and tribulation, most of humanity merely seeks a way to live, raise a family (or create one on a space craft like Mal and his Serenity crew) and die in peace and dignity.<br /><br />Kudos to Josh Whedon and shame on Fox.  Glad to see that most everyone on the staff and cast went on to a lot of other fine and enjoyable projects.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|My wife is a huge fan of the wizard of oz and couldn't wait for this movie to be released on demand (twins at home keep us from sitting in a theater). My wife loved the movie and thought it was an amazing prequel. I am not a huge wizard of oz fan and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The acting was great and the movie was entertaining. Also, we rented this in HD to experience the full CGI and we were not disappointed. I'd highly recommend this for a movie night and get it in HD. You won't regret it!
B00884GR0W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition , is probably the worst game Ive ever seen.  Block story  is more realistic, easier, more fun, updated more, and makes Minecraft Pe look idiot and worthless.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|This monitor is excellent!  Very clear viewing.  Can watch with my iPhone or iPad.  You can remotely change the music and it has a circle that changes colors or stays one color, you set it. Small and very easy to carry anywhere!  Attaches to the side of a crib or sits on a table.  Night vision is really clear.  I can't say enough about this product!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great for everyone it's funny and sometimes frustrating when you don't beat vector and the graphics are great!!!!!!!!!!!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I wish Mr. Cline was not trying so  hard to be William Gibson.  That being said, he has an easy unassuming prose.  The characters are realistic and likeable.  The story was both a disturbing glimpse of the future and a fun adventure tale.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Most of the time this app works a lot better and faster than the actual website.It doesn't freeze up, and is very user friendly.
B004JRVQX0|5.0|Works as advertised! As soon as it came in, i loaded my pro tools 11 license and it works. Love the design over the first one
159463176X|4.0|I would actually rate it 4 1/2.  Hosseini is a talented storyteller.  The value of this particular novel is in his ability to express the culture and reasoning of a people without writing a nonfiction work.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|I love it. Best of Hitchcock's for me. I could watch it over and over. I like it as well as Psycho and Rope.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I loved it. Tear jerker at certain places though. Loved the cast. Just an all around amazing movie and its def worth the watch. You'll be pleased.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|awesome! Graphics are great and fun game for all ages!  It has a fabulous interface and is very user friendly.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|This might have started off as a good idea, but you can see the re-writes and studio notes all over the movie.  What made it to the screen is a typical paint-by-numbers hollywood product.  There is nothing interesting about this movie, and I'm sure it will be quickly and deservedly forgotten.
B003UYUP58|4.0|Excellent review of many aspects of cancer.  Very technical at times covering a infinitely complex disease. All in all a great read for cancer patients and interested people.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|the hobit is a awesome movie with comedy and action my favorite part is when the dwarfs where doing the dishes and singing
B001MKQS4O|5.0|Actors break down into two groups for me; excellent and great.  The first group, the excellent actors, bring us &#34;themselves&#34;, playing a role perfectly.  Examples might be Robert De Niro, Helen Hunt, Alfre Woodard, even Jack Nicholson.  The second group is very much smaller.  It is composed of great actors who leave themselves behind and become a completely new character, leaving behind the actor and morphing 100% into the role.  We have to look very hard to find the remnants of the actor inside the new character.<br /><br />Phillip Seymour Hoffman, playing Capote, belongs in this second group; not just for his work in Capote but certainly this was the best  vehicle for his magic.  This film is a must see because of his performance.  It is also beautiful filmed, wonderfully written, and intriguing.
B009JBZH54|5.0|i love the dark knight trillogy from beging to end it always kept me on my toes with many twist and turns
B0091X2K0A|5.0|Watching this in 1987, closer to the Vietnam reality, it said and meant different things than watching it in today's context.  The characters and script have provided almost universal punch lines like, &#34;Me love you long time&#34; or the less well known, &#34;They're paying for it, you eat it.&#34;<br /><br />The soundtrack has been copied enough times to make another whole movie, I believe.  It's that good.<br /><br />The characters would seem today a bit hackneyed but are nearly perfect characterizations; almost cartoons - the drill sergeant comes to mind.  And the beauty of the movie is, the drill sergeant is spot on.<br /><br />Kubrick made a beauty here.  Watch it several times.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Great action packed fun and keep's you on your seat wondering what is going to happen next and what unexpected issue is going ot arise.  It is a wonderful action filled series to watch.
B00BX8PG4S|2.0|PHANTOM took me by surprise when I saw it was on DVD. I hadn't heard of the movie yet it stars one of my favorite actors, Ed Harris. The description on the DVD case made the story seem fantastically interesting. I had to see this film. It's a simple but incredible premise. Rogue agents from take over control of a Soviet submarine armed with nuclear missiles. We eventually learn what the \\"Phantom\\" is and its potential role in starting WW III and making the Soviets look like innocent players in the world scene. OK, sounds good but something gets totally lost in this film. The plot seems contrived and even another great performance by Ed Harris can save this film.<br />PHANTOM takes place almost entirely inside a real Soviet submarine that is currently in San Diego, CA. The remarkable realism is overshadowed by the dark lighting of the film. It's often hard to see faces and background in the film though I commend the filmmakers on using a real submarine and not one created on a set.<br /><br />A film set in a submarine automatically creates a sensation of claustrophia for the actors and the viewers. The action only picks up near the end of the film when a crisis is approaching. I want to be vague about the plot but it certainly was not satisfying. It says something about a film when the bonus features are MUCH more interesting and informative than the movie. The opening of PHANTOM says it is \\"inspired by true events\\" and the bonus features explain the \\"true events\\", though we are still left to wonder what really happened to the submarine that \\"inspired\\" this movie. SO much missed potential in this film.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|I have alway's loved this classical musical movie and had it in VCR format to end up losing my ability to play my VCR movies and now have both Grease movies in DVD format.  I love watching a variety of great films of all kinds of musical's and well worth the ra watching difference in depicting the Era's different type of music and things that went on in those days. :)
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|When I heard there was going to be a third book about Ava and Gideon from the Crossfire series, I immediately went to preorder it for my Kindle. As I started reading it, I realized she was setting us up for another book. Sorry if that is a spoiler.  The book delves more into Gideon's abuse, characters are introduced that you have not met, there is an  unplanned pregnancy, conspiracy, and the aftermath of the murder from the previous book. I just feel like the writer threw the kitchen sink at you and did not tell you to duck. If you are a fan of the previous to books, it is a must read but just watch out for the kitchen sink. Lastly, my favorite scene involves Ava and Gideon at a construction site.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Great cast, silly movie, oddly paced and disconnected. Jamie Fox was totally unbelievable in his character. I could have done better directing.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|FAOTD how bad can it be?<br /><br />Start it up, banner ad.  Admittedly this was fir another game they make, but they are literally using a normal advertisement framework for it.  Will they show regular advertisements in the future?<br /><br />Start playing, introduced to yellow and dingy yellow, immediately confuse them the whole game.<br /><br />Controls start fighting me.  Stage doesn't rotate fast enough, blocks don't go where I press, sometimes the blocks drop seemingly somewhere completely different to where the very faint purple dashed lines indicate they should go.<br /><br />Also the blocks default to the highest stack, but when the highest stack formed because the game ignored where I press and forced it...<br /><br />So the game finally ended and I got a screen that said stuff that was illegible and &quot;share your score on Twitter&quot;  and I couldn't find anywhere to click to continue (obviously I didn't click share scores, perhaps that would have worked)  So I had to press the back button, and that dropped me back to the Amazon app store, prompting me to write this review.<br /><br />In short, this game is a physical assault on your eyes that will fight you every step of the way as you try to play, and then lick you out of the game when it has had it's way with you, without so much as a thank you for the 99 cents they expect you to pay.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Although the death at the end (spoiler) was very hard to bear, for my wife and myself, we understand that the actor requested termination, so we have to accept it.  That aside, there were so many pleasures in this third season of what has to be one of the finest shows of all time.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Did not want it to end.  Love is stronger than fear. Looking forward to the next book. Thank you, Jill Sanders
1572814136|5.0|I dabbled in tarot years ago and had the plain Rider-Waite set that at the time came with two guide books in a nice box set. I lost interest in the cards, and apparently lost the cards too, until recently when a tarot reading (using the Rider-Waite) revealed I was a bit intuitive and that I should consider reading the tarot. I thought that was odd because it was the second time in my life that a reading had revealed that. I already had several books on the shelf and picked up another the day of that reading.  So, now it was time to buy a new set of cards.<br /><br />I chose this deck mainly just to have something a bit different from the regular set without straying completely from it. The &#34;Radiant&#34; part of their title really just refers to enhanced color. All of the cards are still based on the original version as far as the pictures go. So, I would definitely suggest this deck to anyone who is looking to buy the basic deck, or someone who might want something a bit &#34;prettier&#34; to look at. As you have probably heard before, it needs to be the deck that speaks to you.<br /><br />However, the tiny guidebook including won't be enough if you are serious about learning the tarot like I am.  Pick up two or three basic instruction books - there are several on the market.  Thumb through them and try to stick with the ones that show the Rider-Waite pictured inside. Most of your basic starter books do.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have been playing this game on my computer.  It really makes me feel bad though.  I don't recognize the symbols and time is up before I get it sorted out in my mind.  Then I can't tell which tiles can be used or which layer they are on.  A lot of thought has gone in to this game.  The coloration lets me see which tiles should be used and the patterns let me see the different symbols.  The time option lets me go fast or take my time to figure it out.  I enjoy playing this game on my Kindle and I feel like I am improving my mind while playing it.
B000HZHBIM|4.0|Good effects.  Wish the storyline was a little better.  As others have said, they borrowed a plot from a previous movie, which was a bit disappointing to me.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Really enjoy playing this game competing against friends makes it much more fun... Only thing I woud like is a little more info on obtaining stars on each level
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Creative, interesting, and well written. Not my normal type of book to read, but enjoyed it very much and looking forward to reading more of this series!
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|We all enjoyed watching this video.  The video and sound quality was great and the subject matter was fun.  Certainly easy process of renting from Amazon makes it great as well
B002SQNM9A|4.0|I knew this before hand and still bought it, so its not a huge deal, but it does only have 6 songs and they aren't honestly the best ones in the world, but if you like T-Swift, you'll like this album.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|My kids and I love it, its a great game specially when you want to calm your kids while waiting for anything.
B006N57PXG|5.0|I love  British humor (like Douglas Adams and Andrew Harmon)<br />put it in a magician's world and I'm sold!<br />Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Just like all the other Mahjong puzzle that I have, they are a good thinking game, when<br />it is timed, you really have be alert to what you do, so you get a good score to move on
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game for adults and kids,  my 6 yr old and I had a ball playing this game.  well worth the time put into it!
B004J64QR4|5.0|This concert edition of Les Miz is fantastic! The only down side is Nick Jonas. While he has a good voice, it was not quite up to par with the rest! Val Jean, Javert, Cosette, Fantine, Enjorales, Gavroche, Eponine, & and the Thenardiers were all so perfect for their roles! incredible talent and a performance that was captivating and gave me chills over and over! The cinematography was great and the sound was well adjusted. I would HIGHLY recommend this video for my fellow Miz lovers!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is fun, but there's no real thought process that goes into it.  If you're looking for something to just kill time, this is your game.  If you're looking for something that will make you think, even a little, this isn't a good game for you or the kids.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It's a fun game but can get boring but I can mange it so yeah fun that's all a really got to say ..............  the pets are cute so are the buildings
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I reviewed the last version of this, and this is even better.  More tracks to play on, and really fun to try and find different ways to beat the game.  Again, as the last time, these games are very addictive, and you'll lose hours and days...  Beware!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game has great graphics with multiple maps.There are different game modes coop,PvP,3v3,and 5v5. There are different characters to play as and each week you could use free characters.
0307237699|2.0|I bought this book for my wife, I am not interested in reading it. Perhaps if he shows more pride of the USA, I might read it.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Outstanding musical experience - interesting story- superb performances!!! The two main vocal talents (Karen and Ivy) competing for the role of Marilyn are unique and exciting talents.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|It was a lovely movie.  My 10 year old loved it!  She wants to see a second movie produced because it was such a great movie.
B00466HM28|4.0|The piano keys feel like  the keys of a toy piano that you would buy for a child, the pads are not that sensitive you have to kind of pound them, to fix this issue I took a part the MPK Mini and placed a piece of electrical tape behind each pad and that fixed the issue. Very light weight and portable it fits in your laptop bag, you can create whole songs or its a easy way to get your ideas of your head to your pc/mac  while on the road or just using it as your main midi controller. I can't say this product is for everyone but for me overall I'm satisfied.<br /><br />I found this video on youtube on how to apply electrical tape behind MPk mini pad to make the pads more sensitive.<br />[...]
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great puzzle game but the lack of levels makes it a bit too quick of a playthrough. Can't. wait for an update!
B001LX2J22|5.0|I had watched this film a long time ago and now watched it again because it is the basis for the new Hannibal TV series. It is a great film and the actors are top notch. Of course Anthony Hopkins plays the quintessential Hannibal Lecter, But I have to say Mads Mikkelsen does a fantastic job as Hannibal in the new series. Watching it again put me in the mood to once again watch Silence of the Lambs.
B000FBJGKO|4.0|I found this book when I was visiting Brick Lane in London.  It looked like an interesting neighborhood, so I looked forward to learning more from a novel.<br /><br />The novel is exquisitely well written.  Almost too much so.  The heroine's experiences of being pulled from Bangladesh into the slums of London were very painful indeed.  The letters from her pretty sister who stayed behind are just as depressing.  Reading these stories for chapter after chapter is very hard. The structure of the novel provides minimal break from the pain of their lives.<br /><br />I found that, at the very least I had to intersperse my reading with more \\"entertaining\\" novels.  According to my Kindle, I am only 30% in. I don't know if I will be able to finish.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved the first two seasons and love season 3 as well. The cast and storylines are exceptional--keep us coming back for more. :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We love this app.  My 8 and 10 year olds work together to figure out the levels and cant wait for more to come out.  This is a fun way to learn reasoning and planning.
1574214276|3.0|I liked a lot of the info and designs in the book, but trying to copyright certain doodle patterns strikes me as stupid. Yes, copyrighting the name \\"Zentangle\\", ok, fine. But a lot of the book reads like a commercial for the website's products, when really all you need is a piece of paper and a pen or pencil. And, no, dear authors, I WON'T put your copyright info on *my* doodles, just because you tell me I should.<br /><br />Doodling as meditation is nothing new. That said, I like the book's layout and the way it shows how simple repetitive pattern drawing can be. It's a great way to get past the concept that \\"I can't draw because I'm not a REAL ARTIST\\".<br /><br />And the little \\"Zentangle Inspiration\\" quotes from devotees... Uh, whatever. If it works for you as a form of healing meditation, that's great. But it won't necessarily change *your* life, any more than taking up swimming, or some other form of meditation, or learning to garden. If it clicks for you, wonderful. (I enjoy it and find it soothing.)But it's not exactly a one size fits all cure for whatever is keeping you from being happy or fulfilled or spiritually grounded.<br /><br />Summing up... decent book, cool patterns and suggestions. Designed to sell specialized products that are nice but not essential. Good reference guide if you ignore the fluffy stuff.
159463176X|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed by this writer! Three story lines right in the first few chapters and couldn't figure out where the book was going. But have patience and it will all be explained and will intersect eventually. Wonderful imagination as always and real characters who you feel for. This is a captivating read.  I loved it and went back to read parts of it again.
1476733953|4.0|My son bought this for me for my birthday.  Once I started reading the book, it was hard to put down until about the halfway point, because the situation and plot were much different--that is, actually creative--than in any recent sci-fi book I had read.  (Nearly all sci-fi novels--with the exception of several of Jack McDevitt's books and perhaps a couple of others, but even he has had a couple of real clunkers--during the past 15 years have been of very low quality.)  At about the halfway point, I began to feel a little as though the book was being stretched out with \\"filler action,\\" but at least the action was mildly interesting.  It also was clear by the end that the conclusion was going to leave the reader hanging to some extent, but at least there was a definite and satisfying \\"end,\\" even though I suspect that the author plans to turn this into a series of books--unfortunately, in my view, as it seems that too many of today's authors seek to write series instead of composing self-contained, high-quality novels.  Overall, it was a good read and certainly of a quality considerably above most of the recent competition.  I rate this book with some of the best of McDevitt's work during the past 20 years and well above most others of the past 15 years.  It is not as good as a lot of books published prior to the 1990s, such as Vernor Vinge's best or many of the other classics, hence the 4 stars.  I wish the author all the best in trying to top this; today's science fiction needs all the help it can get, because it has been so bad that I am afraid to buy any new books after wasting so much on a long string of bad ones.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I like the levels. The complication is good enough to keep my interest and excited about next level.<br />Going to check out more games from this company.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I Love the game and find myself strangely addicted therefore I hate It too. Still going to play it though
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is simple and easy to use,  loads quickly,  and is perfect for everyday use. I call up this everyday and can often beat my husbands iphone in terms of speed and ease of use.
B009AMAJVO|4.0|DEAD MAN DOWN is a love story about two emotionally scarred people who are seeking revenge.<br /><br />Victor (Colin Farrell) works for a vicious New York City crime lord (Terrence Howard), pulling the trigger whenever he is ordered to do so.  He, however, has a secret agenda that is temporarily sidetracked when he meets Beatrice (Noomi Rapace), a crime victim seeking retribution, and she's willing to blackmail Victor in order to get it.<br /><br />I don't want to be a \\"spoiler,\\" so I'm not going to provide any further plot details on this intriguing, suspense-filled, often touching, film that some surprising story twists.  Directed by Niels Arden Opley, the picture contains several well-staged action sequences, though the final one is a bit over the top. But, more importantly, the performances, particularly that of Ms. Rapace, are mesmerizing.  When she is on screen, she fully commands your attention.<br /><br />Also in the stellar cast are Dominic Cooper, F. Murray Abraham, Isabelle Huppert and Armand Assante.<br /><br />The 2-disc combo pack from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains Blu-ray, DVD and Digital version of the picture.  Extras include three \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman
B009NY43NY|3.0|I don't want to give anything away in my review. However, I will say that I found the storyline of Eric and Sookie's relationship to be drawn out, boring, and the time could have been better spent building up her latest relationship so that it was more gripping.
B0094OLJD0|3.0|I saw this performed in concert, and of course it was fun to see and hear live. The record though, has much better sound quality and more going on musically, so it has it's good points too. It's a decent record conceived and performed by to brilliant artists. What could be bad? It really depends on your expectations; If you were looking for a David Byrne record, you will be a little disappointed.
B003FHGI9W|5.0|When my friend told me to watch this I thought, &#34;Pleeeez....dog stories are NOT my thing.&#34;  Can I tell you that this is now one of my all-time favorite movies.  I have told all my friends that it is a must see....but only if you want your heart to burst wide open.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written script brings the characters to life.  I am &#34;hooked!&#34;  The series envelops the viewer from the start and it's easy to see why so many of us have become die hard fans.  I'm looking forward to the 4th season.  And in anticipation, I plan to revisit the 1st three seasons just before the 4th season airs in the U.S.  My only criticism is that I wish that the 4th season would air simultaneously world-wide.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love it. I use it almost every day and have printed some of my images just like a photograph and they look good. It is not as overpowering as a PC program like Paint Shop Pro, or other programs, but this little thing is so much fun.  There are ranges of colors in two paint brush styles, colored pencils, crayons and markers. There are a few colors of stamps with stars, curves, and dots. There are lots of stickers too, though I haven't used those much. There are a number of selections for paper too. Two wishes I would have for it--more paint brush colors and a blending tool.<br /><br />One question:  I've posted a few things to something called The Gallery...but don't know where that goes...I assume somewhere online, but I've searched and never found it.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|Too many special effects, not enough story. Kind of like fireworks. Fun, but only for a half hour or so.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|nice chess app. It plays well it is easy to use and  comes with different difficulty levels. Overall a good product.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The game is very easy to play. It is an awesome alternative to original solitare. Excellent graphics :o) Being able to personalize the game makes it even better.
B003THHIEM|5.0|My favorite series on t.v. Enjoy the writing, acting and cast. It's a perfect fit.<br /><br />The end of season cliff-hanger is always something to look forward to.<br />Here's hoping the season launch this fall will be a great one.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After a couple of flaky logitech wireless mice I decided to go back to a corded mouse. After finding a lot of different positive reviews and an attractive price, I thought I would give this mouse a try. Mouse feels solid. After having problems with cordless mice jumping around the screen it feels good to have the consistency of a corded mouse. As for gaming, It might not be the best mouse on the market, but it gets the job done. Nice to have &#34;on the fly&#34;  DPI settings. Software is easy to use. Buttons fully customizable. Price is definitely right.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I never write reviews, but I can't get over how handy this app has been and continues to be. Whether I'm at my desk at work and need to email something from my home computer, or 10' away from my computer with a cat on my lap (every cat owner knows you can't move in this situation), this has come in handy more times than I can count. I frequently use it from work to download shows so they're ready to watch when I get home. I snagged this when it was free, but it's definitely worth the price.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Incredibly realistic zombie plague. Many different cultures and characters, different opinions but all very likely to happen and makes you believe the story.
B00B31DT5I|4.0|Not quite what I expected. Like his older songs better, many of his other albums are.better in my opinion. Still, it's Michael Bolton all the way!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is a great movie, highly recommended existential theme. Very well done, but one needs to watch this movie carefully with as few distractions as possible.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Although it unfolds too quickly and too slow at some points throughout the first and second seasons but such is the history of the era-confusiong and in layers. Overall, as a history enthusiast, I absolutely love this series.
0345529057|5.0|I was so excited to start reading this so the fact that it shipped really fast and still wrapped in its package was awesome. I am only 3/4 of the way through the first book but I can't put it down. I intend to buy the 5th of this series the further along I get. I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves a good action-packed fantasy book series. LOVE it!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I did not use this game, decided I was not interested in it.  My son played it and liked it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a challenging game for the brain and makes you think a lot but it is very fun to play
B002SRQ214|5.0|I just got around too putting new rig togeather, popped cpu in an it runs like a champ,im vary happy with this buy,and that theres a amazon,what a great way to shop.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I completely love this series. From the first book A Quest of Heroes, all the way through to A Charge of Valor. I can't get enough and I wish I could stretch out the time it takes to read each story as they are released but, I can't stop reading them once I begin. Love the Sorcerer's Ring!
B00CMKDMM4|5.0|This was hands down the most informative travel book I read on Romania. I'll be traveling by train and I appreciated that the guide did not assume the reader could travel by car.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|Forget the movie.  This book is a hundred times better. The true Holly is no doe eyed romatic waiting for George Peppard to sweep her off her feet and the guy upstairs is the gay upstairs, but that just makes the story beter.  Unbelieavably smart dialogue and bueatifully drescriptive writng.  An American literary gem.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|Still a great movie! My granddaughter loved too! Still jumped out if the seat!  Don't bother with the sequel !
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Superb movie. One of the better portrayals of the actual lifestyle of the mob. Great casting! Good screenplay. Keeps  you wanting more
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Warts and all, Cheryl Strayed has written an inspiring tale about her crazy as hell adventure on the PCT.  Almost made me want to hit the trail myself - almost.
B000IVW25M|2.0|Wanted to get a Snow White DVD for our kid's to watch for a car trip we are taking. It is taking FOREVER to get here and we will not have it for our trip. I guess Goodwill Industries doesn't mean GOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I'll never buy from them again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun (occasionally frustrating) game to sharpen your mind.  I work on it when I have a few minutes to kill.  I definitely recommend it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great shows!  Love the drama in both the worlds.  I am always looking forward to the next episode to see what unfolds.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Different pregnancy experiences and birthing situations well played by all actresses.  A must see whether you plan to have a baby or not!
B005544TRQ|5.0|glad I found this show. Moving on to season two, and looking forward to season three. would definitely recommend this show
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I really like this artist.  Her music is a great fusion of genres and it is fun to listen to.
B008SLAXGO|4.0|The book is beautiful! the only thing I have to say though is that I had bough the book &#34;New&#34; but when it came, it looked like is should have been called good in the used category. I'm not sure if that is from the mailing process or from the seller but the cover HAS been used somehow. The back of it on the corner was ripped a good 2 inches down and it was kinda dirty from handling. Without the cover, I would say the book could be said &#34;like new&#34; or &#34;very good&#34; other than that, I would buy from this seller.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Hearing the song &#34;Radioactive&#34; on the Defiance Game commercial made me look to see who created the awesome song.  It was Imagine Dragons: Night Visions.  There is not a single song on this CD that I don't care for.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked the personal stories of the lives and characters portrayed in this book. It caused me to reflect on my own life experiences and relationships, as I read it. I guess you could say we all have familiar strands and themes running through all of our lives. We really are all the same.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I think this is a great family show and enjoy watching it online. I don't remember when it was on TV but I'm sure I would have watched it then
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I enjoyed the whole book. It was not only interesting, but touched on historical facts that added to the subject of the book.<br />I could not put it down and was sorry when it was over. I'd recommend it to anyone and it would make an amazing book for a book club discussion.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Highly entertaining, funny and heart warming! Every thing  movie should have. If you see this movie on sale or regular price buy it! Kids love this movie.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|It was engaging, informative, and inspiring, so much so that I've begun experimenting with some of the techniques offered and I must say I do believe that I'm on to something here. Joshua Foer is like a superhero to me, providing his hand to help me and those like me escape the abyss of forgetfulness. Though I'm not quite moonwalking with Einstein like the superhero Joshua Foer, I feel I will be one day and what great feeling that is. I love it: Engaging! Informative! Inspiring! If you haven't read it, what are you waiting for?
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This show is so great I can't believe I never started watching when it first came on tv.  I've watched all four seasons and am addicted to this show. I can't wait for season 5 to be on tv!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was full of bad acting and a poor plot. James Franco was so unbelievable and over acting thatbit was painful to watch him.  The only part I liked was the wicked witch of the west.  At least her acting was marginal, but the rest was dumb.  They went too far astray from the original wizard of oz and tried too hard to be different.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome best game I have ever played but you should add a plane vehicle and a plane place like mabey a hanger
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Sad because I loved the first two. Should have ended as a trilogy. Now it's about the money not the writing or work product for the author. Series definitely needs to be brought to conclusion. If she wraps it up in a fourth book I might consider buying it to get closure. If she drags it out to a fifth, forget it.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Loved this book. It is mysteries, surprising and all in all a genuinely great romantic novel. I also watched the movie after reading the book and it just makes you love the book even more.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This one was my second favorite in the series, my first being the first book. I always like when the hero is shown to grow.
B004TSKKF4|3.0|It was hard to start reading but once I got into it, turned out to be a lovely read. I would recommend this book.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Its a little slow to load the application.<br /><br />I've had similar experience with image content in a book.<br /><br />so, its ok, not so great.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Its too long and i was expecting the original story. I couldnt go through reading it. Really, not that good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|gets more challenging with each level. thought it was pretty fun. can't wait for more levels. hope that will be soon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Realistic in a lot of ways. Great for kids and horse lovers alike. The tasks take a lot of time though, but it's still a great game. No glitches or blurs.
B004IPPINW|3.0|Wonderful descriptive style and a gripping narrative regarding the period of time around 9/11 that engenders greater sympathy for the Muslim contingent in the US at that time than I have encountered elsewhere.  Agree that the US has not conducted itself well internationally, but the complete absence of condemnation of the terrorists in either New York or India is unnerving.  The narrator is incredibly likable but mentally unhinged.
159463176X|2.0|Having read and loved his first two books, I eagerly anticipated this new book by Khaled Hosseini.  I had to force myself to finish it.  So very disappointed.  Like other reviewers here, I found the book to be awkwardly put together; it was very disjointed.  Very little character development, because now we are on to the next character.  So many \\"first person\\" chapters, and always I thought, Now who is talking?  I wanted to love this book.  I wish it had not disappointed me.
B0012QK8OE|1.0|The parts that are actually there are fine, but there are two major flaws that utterly ruin the listening experience.<br /><br />First, Long Distance Runaround fades out instead of segueing into The Fish, which jarringly starts at full volume in mid-transition.<br /><br />Next, the reprise of We Have Heaven simply isn't there.  Very disappointing and I will be seeking a refund.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|The premise has been done before in sci-fi. There is no real plot, just a chase. Didn't bother to finish it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Fantastic entertainment not for the faint of heart.  Fighting crime in the &#34;Hood&#34; with leader of the Strike Team Detective Vic Mackey is brutal, gritty and fraught with perilous and politically intricate interpersonal relationships that keep you on the edge, episode after episode.  A big point is made about how crossing the line of what is ethically and morally acceptable when fighting this type of war may actually be crucial for success: You can't tie the hands of your best warriors.  Look forward to an amazing stint as Captain later on in the series by Glenn Close.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Well worth watching. I love that I could view this series from season 1 via Amazon Prime Videos.  Thanks Amazon!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman at his finest.  Words flow like quicksilver, images paint in dense patches, worlds are created, dreams given flight.  Beautiful.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. It was fun seeing a storyline before Dorothy. The visual effects were great even on just the TV
B006TMMY02|5.0|If you are a Ray Harryhausen lover this is a must own movie.  Ray was a  magnificent artist at what he did and this one of the best.
B002R22PB6|4.0|This is a great movie and the acting is spectacular. A little hard to digest because of the nature of the subject matter.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|simply the best show on tv today, only dvd worth purchasing, high quality tv watch it again and again and........
B00AYB1RXE|5.0|Really fun look into the life of this fantastic musician.  Low on cheese and high on story this is a fun engaging watch.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|not the kind of tv i would normally watch but once you start you get hooked and filmed in my area
B0098XY5VK|4.0|This game is fun when there is nothing to do, keeps you occupied...I would recommend it to my friends.  They should make a similar game called HOT DOG OBAMA.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just a great game love finding different things and gets a bit difficult every room. Would never figure this would be as good as it is. Cool game!
B00C1BTN6S|4.0|in my opinion Jane Eyre was not in her full capabilities. In the book she is more intellect and independent and the conversations between her and Mr. Rochester more varied. I also wanted to see some more of the aftermath. Of course it is impossible to include everything in a short film, and thus far this is the best filmatisation of the novel.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the only thing wrong with this is at first not enough games are unlocked.<br />however I really like the games they are very fun.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|The special efects were veryreal and actors amazing. Loved it but haven`t read the book though. Definitely should watch this!!
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Have watched it twice now. Good representation of long distance accurate rifle shooting. An intriguing plot with a lot on twists and turns. Also a lot on action.
071815780X|1.0|Makes it look easy!<br />Great cookbook.!  The TV series is a big help too.  I've given it as a gift to several friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a must read!!! Just a great action-filled book!! A page turner!! Another one of Suzanne Collins chilling/amazing books!!! GREAT JOB MRS. COLLINS!!!!
B001FB4W02|5.0|Lana is gone(almost). Lois and Clark are growing  closer. Doomsday is coming . But  alas no more Lex(miss Michael Rosenbaum. He was great. Best Lex Luthor ever). Just one great season.
0879306033|4.0|I bought a P600 new, just when the DX7 was introduced. Back then, I questioned removing myself from Yamaha's waiting list after only 8 months, and taking the old-school Prophet instead. But I still have it, Its in full working order, and I'm really glad now. Its also heartening to see that today, Dave Smith is reclaiming his turf ! All in all, I found the unique, American stories of Sequential, ARP, Moog, OB and the pianos a journey thru a life left behind. Don't believe the price reference of top-tier analog synths is accurate though. Probably just needs an update. I wish I'd have kept the P5 I got for free LOL couple years back. I'd recommend this book to anyone coming of age in the heyday. Kudos.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It was fun to play until I ran out of &#34;B&#34;. You then have to use real money to buy some more so you can continue playing. Don't plan to do that so I guess I will be deleting the game.
B0000060LT|5.0|This album is perfection. It's songs build fluidly from one to another, reaching an incredible climax, and then bringing you to a place of release and relaxation. It is sensual, making you want to be as present as possible in your body. It has that moment that musicians reach so hard for, that moment where the music connects you to something greater. Coltrane did it. Dirty Three does it with this album too. Put it on. Move your body. And if you are so lucky, go see them live.
B000P407K4|5.0|It takes a little while to acclimate to a movie that centers on dialogue and performance instead of over the top effects and overly romanticized setting. But then, you begin to take notice of the detail put into the simultaneous parodying and lamenting of unintended consequences (the ego, nuclear aggression, and the repetition of unsavory history are central themes). \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" delivers on walking the thin line between comedy and poignant critique.
B00A2H9PLG|4.0|\\"I can't think of a more important job then protecting the President.\\" John Cale (Tatum) is a policeman working in Washington D.C. Trying to reconnect with his young daughter he brings her with him to the White House for his interview with the Secret Service. While there they meet the President (Foxx) and she is having the best day. When a group attacks the White House and goes after the President the only person who is able to help is Cale. Now he has to try and protect both the President and get his daughter out safely. I was pretty excited about seeing this. I am a big Jamie Foxx fan, but I was leery of Tatum (not a fan). I will admit that the chemistry between them was very good and the movie had some very funny parts in this as well as wall to wall action. This is the latest movie in Hollywood's \\"I can do it better\\" series. Other movies in this club are Deep Impact & Armageddon, Illusionist & Prestige, movies with the same idea coming out close to each other. While Olympus Has Fallen was OK and worth seeing this one was way better and if you had to choose between the two this is the way to go. There really isn't a dull moment in this and I highly recommend it. Overall, not an Oscar type movie and a little predictable but a movie that is very exciting and fun. I really liked it. I give it an A-.
038572179X|3.0|I admit I haven't yet finished this book--I've just finished the first part--but it is wearing me out.  I'm trying to convince myself to finish it.  Some reviewers complained that it contains too much description.  Now, I like a novel with a strong sense of place, so I don't mind all the scenic description.  What gets me is the downright interminable interior deliberations of certain characters.  I understand that the shifting narrative perspective and the psychological perceptiveness are part of the craft of this novel, but oy, really, it goes too far.  It features pages and pages of second-by-second descriptions of a character's shifting moods, thoughts, and motivations, especially those of the vaguely exasperating Briony.  It's the literary equivalent of chewing for hours on that little wad of fiber you have left in your mouth after you eat some celery.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|I absolutely love this mini series and hope that it is like 4,5 or more seasons!!! Michael Hirst done a fantastic job with The Tudors as well as Hatfields and Mcoys!!  I am a Love world history and he has done his homework very well. A+. Can hardly wait for it to come out on DVD so I can purchase it. Looking forward to the next season!!!!!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|What an awesome experience!!! And the delivery was so quick!! Although, on the second episode of the first disc, it's sound is a little screwed up, but it's only for a minute or two.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just the right amount of challenge to keep you playing.  I've not wanted to run off to find a cheat  somewhere.  I hope new levels come out soon.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|There was only one or two books by Grisham that I did not really enjoy. This was not one of them and I would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys reading Grisham.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Hear game but controls mess up at times , some parts are very hard and time consuming.seems as if they want you to purchase coins to upgrade ur weapons and armor.not fair, otherwise a good game<br />...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoying the game very much. Each level has unique challenges and puzzles. Recommend it for anyone wanting a fun game to play.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Excellent plot and unexpected turns in the movie; and it helps that Matthew McConaughey was the lead actor, love him!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We quickly fell in love with this series when we got the back episodes for season 1 through Netflix.  But we waited in vain for season 2, and only later discovered that distribution had switched to Amazon.  We were overjoyed when we found out we could get the downloaded directly (and free with our &#34;Prime&#34; account, and once again are enjoying it - with season 2 no less terrific than season 1.  It was a bit of a pain to slog through all the steps to get it, and at least with our system to get to it each time we want to watch an episode, but it's very doable and well worth it!  Congrats to Public Broadcasting and Masterpiece Theater!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The graphics are really good and the reason why I play this game is because I love card games and magic.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|For eight seasons now, Sam and Dean Winchester have alternately thrilled me, made me laugh, left me crying, and always kept me on the edge of my seat, and this season is no exception to the rule.<br /><br />My husband and I are constantly amazed by the exceptional research and material gathering that goes into the scripting of this show.  Our hats off to writers, cast, and crew, all of which have made this the latest of 8 thoroughly enjoyable seasons!
B00CO52NLI|1.0|This app is only cool if you get the version that cost money the version that's free sucks big time
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Having read the books, and listened to some of the complaints others who have as well and been upset by bits and pieces left out of the series, all I can say is . . . what are you complaining about?  Of course some details are left out.  These are MASSIVE books, and we all know that the translation from book to film loses a smidge in the translation.<br /><br />That having been said, I was wowed by this series.  HBO did a remarkable job in conveying the truest essence of this storyline (complete with all of its intricacies) into an eye popping series.<br /><br />The sets, locations, and wardrobe are exactly as I envisioned in the books.  The actors do an impeccable job in translating the words into a living, breathing, and completely believable rendition of the characters we love, hate, and love to hate in the books.<br /><br />Bravo!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this show, it's always interesting and a great watch! The characters are great, the stories are always interesting!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have truly enjoyed doing these puzzles.  Keeps me entertained while at work on 12 hour shifts at the hospital.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|I bought this DVD specifically to show to my 15-year old grandson, who is not a big movie fan. He enjoyed it thoroughly, as did I. It had been several decades since I last saw it, but it makes such an impact that it seemed familiar as we watched. There are plenty of thorough reviews here, so I won't add much to the verbiage...will just say that if you've never seen this movie, it's well worth the investment. And if it's an old favorite you haven't seen lately, don't wait as long as I did to watch again.
B008Q0CO0U|4.0|Mark Walhberg and Danny Glover was excellent in this movie. The plot was was so insightful of how our government can be corrupt. Even though it was fictional I wouldn't put it past them. Hooked from beginning to end a MUST SEE!
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Wow, all these years suffering through soggy, crumpled, and chewed cards (from infants, not animals) and *now* I find these? Ah well, better late than never. Got this set as a birthday present for my 4-yr-old and she digs that she can carry them around on the carabiner I bought with it (thanks to other reviews here - the included plastic clip is worthless). Take these to the pool, the beach, or just play with them at home, they have such a nice feel and look to them. And they look like they'll age much better than our sorry-looking UNO deck that has been truly loved over the years.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait for the next season. Want to own it when its finished its entire series. This will be considered a classic.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very intriguing. Some levels are very challenging but none are impossible. Just tap around and you'll start to catch on. Needs more levels!
0399213015|4.0|I love this story and so don't both my kids. Only reason I gave it 4 stars cause because it's a very small copy for $6.  Perfect size for my 7 month old, but way to small for my 4 yr old.  Small book means very small words so think about that when going to purchase.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is definitely one of the best trial books I have ever read!  You can tell that Mr. Landay had a legal background. In this day of DNA testing, the question of nurture vs. nature was very compelling. Also, after the Duke LaCrosse trial, one has to wonder about prosecutors and their agendas. It really made me think. These aspects were skillfully woven into this story. I really needed an option for 6 stars to rate this book. It was that good!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Mixed emotions, heartfelt pain for the destitute family with no where to turn causing generations of pain.  I enjoyed reading Hosseini's latest novel.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun. Not so difficult that you want to give up yet not to easy either.  Waiting for update with more levels.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|It is hard to believe that there are still Holocaust disbelievers out there.  I'm sure if they were to watch this film they would say it was heavily sensationalized.  How they would explain the true life accounts of those who were actually saved by Schindler, I do not know.  The story is fascinating because we watch Schindler, an ordinary man out to make a buck and have a good time, develop a conscience or become more acutely aware of what he already knew what was wrong and take a brave, expensive stand to do the right thing.  The acting, cinematography, plot development - all superb.  The violence is graphic but not gratuitous.  It is necessary to depict the times and events as they were and how they occurred.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone under the age of 11, probably 12 and I am a mother who took her 10 year old daughter to tour Dachau. The violence is extremely graphic and disturbing. The movie brought both my husband and me to tears several times and we're not wimps.<br /><br />I rented this online from Amazon and did have problems with the delivery which was disappointing.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Opened my eyes to another world.Mr Follett keep will keep you on the edge of your seat.I just might read it again!
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|We grew up with the story of Hansel & Gretel, and this was a great next chapter to keep it alive.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is very nice...best sleeping sounds app so far, I have unique tunes every night. The timer is nice and within thirty minutes I am asleep, it has changed my life completely.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Gillian Flynn has me turning the pages and not wanting to keep reading right the very end. Her characters are so different and rather scary. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a thriller with a bit of a twist.
B0007TKNII|1.0|If you want to see ALW's Phantom, watch the Albert Hall version instead. This movie has killed just about everything I love about Phantom. The singing is atrocious, the sets are ridiculous, and the minor characters have been turned into caricatures. There is nothing of the mesmerizing world that exists on the stage.
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|Another page turning, suspense-filled thriller which kept me enthralled and entertained. Again, I would recommend Gillian Flynn's books to anyone who likes mystery thrillers with quirky characters and fascinating plot lines.
0060936223|4.0|It's not that the book doesn't deserve awards, but....  Smith says someone or other taught her to put humor into  her poetry.  And she claims to have used humor to handle hecklers.  And I always thought her musical performances were mischievously offbeat.  But if Smith has a sense of humor, or even perspective, it's missing here.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really gets you thinking one you figure out what's going on.  Difficult to figure out but don't give in to quitting.  It is really worth a try.
B0070YDOT8|3.0|Casino type slots are realistic but crash often and don't work well on most a android devices.  Like that you can interact with other players.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Addicting...just have to get used to the ads before every game. I like that you can choose different types of games to play.
0316044938|3.0|Let me start off by saying I would recommend this book, it's a great read. It had a few cons. The structure of some of the phrasing was awkward and I found myself having to read the same things over and over to clarify the message or essence of the words and in some cases, it was still unclear leaving me feeling kind of empty and unfulfilled. There are a lot and I mean a lot of similes and metaphors in this book, unfortunately more bad than good. The ending of the book just plain sucked. The plot started to really fall apart around 3/4 in. And while it was still engaging, I finished it feeling let down. As for the pros: sebold really knew how to develop her characters. The characterization of Ruana Singh, Jack Salmon, Buckley, Lindsay, and Abigail Salmon is done so well. I was wrapped up in these people and the way in which the author portrays their reactions to Susie's death. The relationships between the characters is beautifully depicted whether or not we agree with them. Read it and see or yourself. You will enjoy it if you can keep an open mind!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This is a delightful way to relax and take it easy----I liked it so much I immediately let a friend I have know about it so she could get it on her Kindle!
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|I placed this order less than a week ago and I have already received it.  Amazon quoted a delivery time much later.  It was a pleasant surprise to see it on my doorstep so quickly.  The books are all in excellent condition with wear on the dust jackets.  They are also all Bantam editions just as promised.  I am very pleased with this shopping experience!
0618001905|5.0|This is not for the faint of heart. It is not \\"torture porn\\" or anything like that--it does not delve into the despicable details of how individual Africans were tortured and murdered, although there are details here and there, and anecdotes. It's more horrifying to see that the enlightened, \\"Christian\\" European manages to build an empire built on lies and torture and pain and death. Some people from Europe resisted, but many more went along due to the riches stolen from Africa to the benefit of Europeans.<br /><br />I remember growing up during the time of transition from colonial Africa to sovereign nations, and during that time there was much evil done by the inhabitants of the colonies. I did not understand why there was so much anger. This book explains how decades of pillaging and death and oppression lead as surely to the explosion as a fuse leads to a bomb.<br /><br />Note that I did not purchase this book from Amazon. My review is based upon my copy borrowed from the library.
B0064MGU98|5.0|If I didn't have to work in the morning I'd watch this show all day and night. Lol it's a crazy good show

B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Best gun app ever since I guns  just read the other opinions I love this app and warphones original please get this game
0307346617|5.0|I've read the book before going to theaters to see Brad Pit's movie, so best you be warned before reading it: there is something like 90% of the book that didn't came to the movie. Some of the best examples of what people did to survive in the story. Overall, I've liked the book more. A great reading, totally mandatory to zombie fans.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Excellent work, similar to &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34;.  Strong human interest theme.  Characters well developed and believable.  It compliments the movie quite well.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|The Crossfire series is AMAZING!!!<br />if you liked 50 shades of grey, well you've read nothing yet. this series and this book are '50' times better than '50 shades of grey'!<br />i assure you.<br />the relationships, storyline and the characters have so much depth and dimension.  The characters of Ava and Gideon will stay with you forever.<br />Sylvia Day's writing is more intriguing and addictive than anything I've read and the result of temporary insomnia due to marathon reading ;)<br />Entwined With You, like its predecessors, surpasses expectations and (at least for a while) quenches the addiction of it's many fans!
B001I9TK1W|5.0|Great Bruce Lee movie to watch! I'm asking if you can put more of his movies underneath prime for prime members to watch!!!
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|We recently decided to have a movie night at home and as Amazon Prime members we selected Marvels The Avengers from their list of free movies. Unfortunately this movie was not our taste for entertainment although it looked as though kids from six up would have liked it. No big deal, we found another movie from their huge list available to Prime customers.
B0085BNIXM|5.0|Great baseball movie by Charlie sheen! Love it!!! Everyone should try to watch it, I'm sure they would like it to!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I bought this book after seeing Dr. Alexander in an interview and found it fascinating. I recommend it to everyone.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Really enjoy this show it has it all. Its funny, interesting, and keeps you wanting to watch more to see if it can beat the episode that you just got done watching.
B00296A4F4|4.0|A lot of song and dance, which I  always enjoy. Also a lot of hilarious dialog. You get the two stories of the teachers life and the kids life.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am still trying to figure out this app but so far I like it. I'm using this first and for most for keeping records of my son's homeschool work. I might even branch off and use it for every day use also.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I love Denzel's movies but this one was BAD. Don't waste your money. The only part worth watching was the flight issue, which only lasted a short time. You will sleep through all the rest. I couldn't give more than one star due to how bad it was.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I'm an adult, reading this book because my kids were, but I totally enjoyed it. Cleverly written, the characters are quirky, but likeable.
B002QS1O36|5.0|I loved this movie simply because its a classic story :) It also stars some of my favorite actors like Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|I've enjoyed all of these DisneyNature movies.  They have the most beautiful cinematography, and It's hard to imagine what these guys went through to get some of those shots of the animals.  Special features are great.  This is a good buy, and I would definitely recommend it on blu ray.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the different subway stations!! It takes me to places I've never been to! I wonder where the next place will be!! So much fun and addictive!
B002ZG9846|5.0|My wife does NOT agree with me on this movie, but I thought it was a blast!  There are a couple great fight scenes and plenty of gratuitous violence.  Might want to prevent the young kids from watching, but I think, at the very least, most guys would enjoy this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Downloaded a few of these games, love it! Its a geat way to kill time, Lots of fun, good brain food,easy to use,<br />Free is always nice too!!!

After she found out he was hijacked she started to feel bad about what she had thought about doing to him. I give this book and the whole series five stars because this women is an amazing author who deserves  the credit of making such an amazing book trilogy. JUST AMZING!

B00CL68NOG|1.0|The movie had a few good moments, but very predictable.  Sad that this movie's previews showed all the best parts of the movie.
B004GJIL34|4.0|More about visual images than dialog, this movie provokes emotions about these historical events. It is helpful to know what had and was happening surrounding the time in which this movie was based.

0684803356|3.0|\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" tells the story of young American Spanish teacher who goes to volunteer in the Spanish civil war. The entire novel takes place over 72 hours in which Robert Jordon, the young American, is responsible, as part of a bigger attack, to bomb a bridge and by that ensure that the Fascists won't be able to send reinforcements after the attack has begun. During those intense 72 hours, Robert Jordon falls in love with Maria, a Spanish girl whose family was murdered by the Fascists. (Isn't it amazing how Hemingway's characters always manage to fall in love faster than it takes one to finish smoking a cigarette?) The story follows Robert Jordon's preparations for the attack and his relationship with Maria and the guerrilla fighters who will assist him with the attack.<br /><br />I am fairly puzzled by this novel, which is considered by many to be Hemingway's best. It offers brilliant observations into the mind of his solider and the psychological aspects of participating in war and how Jordon copes with the hardships of it. While reading some parts of this novel, I was fully absorbed and captivated. In others, I felt it was rather long-winded. Perhaps some editing would have been handy. Although I don't think it is Hemingway's best, I do recommend it to Hemingway's fans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love all of the puzzles. Keeps your brain working. Hurry up and make more rooms. I beat these pretty quickly.
1455502758|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of essays concerning Hitchens' unfortunate cancer, which eventually led to his death. Hitchens shares with us his own experience and thoughts about getting and confronting cancer, and the hopes and disappointments along the way. I found this short collection to be brilliant and moving beyond words. As Hitchens used to say, the best writing is when the reader feels that the author has addressed him personally in his writing; Hitchens achieves exactly that.
B002LHTRV8|4.0|This was a very interesting story and kept me engaged.  I'd seen it before and wanted to view it again.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Violent, but very realistic show about the police and difficulties when dealing with violent criminals.  I loved Hill Street Blues, but this show is better.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was a great novel.  Hard to put down.  I purchased it on the recommendation of a friend and once I started reading it, I expected the same trite story we've seen on any number of Lifetime movies - not so!  I enjoyed every minute of it.  So much so that I have added the authors other books to my amazon wishlist!
B00821OX98|5.0|Fab Story line excellent characters, Worth the time spent watching.  Next up season 2 can't wait to set aside time to watch it.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|What is there not to love!<br />Love this app!<br />Been using this app forever!<br />What did we do before FaceBook!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is great for little girls because it's girls like little cute this like this app u would enjoy this.
B008SAZHLQ|3.0|The book sounds ok. Eleanor and Park were both good characters. The story touched on subjects such as low income families, race and being an outcast. The characters feelings developed over several slow interactions building into a good friendship and then something more. It was all well written, but for reasons I don't understand I was bored to tears and waiting for it to be over. I was waiting for something to happen, but it's just not that kind of story. It was a simple tale of two young people and it was nicely done, but it just left me not quite satisfied.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Addicted. Watch it and decide. I rarely give a review or look forward to buying the blu ray set. Can not wait !
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I have downloaded and it didn't install because it took too much space. Do not download it. It will take away your space.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story was very interesting and correctly described many orphans' experiences. The story line was very believable and both happy and sad. Thank goodness we recognize that children are more than chattel today but the will to survive and prosper ring through this book.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this show!!  I didn't watch it when it came out because I thought the commercials looked dumb.  I started watching  it on Amazon Prime and could not put my kindle down.  I'm bummed that the third season isn't free but I'm sure, in time, it will be.  And then I'll continue watching the show.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book had many twists and had an interesting idea but was slightly unbelievable when Jacob's parents took sides concerning Jacob's guilt.
B00D6BQG1W|3.0|The movie is slow at points but it is surprisingly funny and the ending is very fast and exciting.  Worth a look.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|No, I can't escape because I can't figure out what I need to do to open the elevator door.  The instructions are not helpful.  I don't play games often so am not familiar with how the operate.  Would need better instructions.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I would recommend this book for my bookclub.  It was an extremely interesting book.  Kept my interest throughout the whole story.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This book got a lot of hype and I feel disappointed after reading it. It was tough to actually get through. The way it was written was as a bit odd and I found myself skipping through a few sections because they were putting me to sleep. It was really just an ok book. Not great.
B003YL4L0W|1.0|The annoying part of this book is that key pages were in scrambled words or Russian after paying 10 99 and can't read complete book, I won't buy another Picoult book.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|I don,t get it but wife and son loves the series and have seen them all. I rather see people fight.
B00D6SBOWG|2.0|I have　loved this game since I got it from big fish for the pc years ago.<br /><br />Lots of fun and addicting.You score \\"golf bucks\\". More bucks if you do better.<br />You use them to buy things like a golf bag full of clubs.  These serve as extra \\"cards\\" to help you finish the game.<br /><br />The  directions on Amazon says that's how it works.  That's how it works on the pc.<br />But on on the kindle golf bucks don't work.  You have to spend real money to buy stuff.  And its expensive.  Some are $4.99.the whole game was only 99 cents.<br /><br />Great game but BEWARE and don't buy something for real money.
1611761921|5.0|I saw the Tom Cruise movie and decided I needed to read some of the books.  This was Child's first introduction and its a spell binder.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I cannot wait until the future levels come out!! This game is solo fun and challenging and addictive in a good way. :)
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Finally an app for the Kindle Fire HD that allows me to watch YouTube videos! I watch videos all of the time for hair tutorials so I'm glad I can watch them from my Kindle now and not just my phone.<br /><br />It has ads, but that does not bother me. I would love it if it had the option to comment on videos. If it has that option, I had a hard time finding it.<br /><br /> Overall, I like this app and would recommend it to a friend because it has the basics and it's free!
0307476073|5.0|First of all, I'm a guy and I'm not a hiker.  I'm not really outdoorsy at all.  So I didn't expect to connect with this book.  But I'm a memoir fanatic--er, connoisseur--so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />And wow!  We get enough details of the hike and the great outdoors to bring them to life, but in a way they're metaphors or symbols.  The book is not about hiking per se.  It's about this young woman's fight to find her way in life, not just on the trail.  Deeply personal, moving without being maudlin, and yes, inspiring.<br /><br />Also, it's really well written.  Smooth and easy and smart.  An intelligent and pleasant read!
B00CL68BK2|3.0|I had higher expectations for this movie.  I'm glad I watched it without my husband.  He would have hated it.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Wars are dirty and make horrible policy for anyone.  Old warriors often know this better than most. Reacher must recruit and use the old warriors to solve and avenge the innocent in this whodunit. Enlightening and Thoroughly engrossing read.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I had forgotten how violent and cruel the story is - no wonder Disney never optioned it for a film. The writing is space and antiquated but it moves at a good pace. The dog's eye view of the world is interesting, definitely good reading material for summer camp
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|The package arrived when promised and in good condition. I love this movie. I watch on the same day it arrived.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Fun to play and addicting.  It could use more variation.  With the digital version the game board should have the option to be expanded with more players.  If you want a $5 game you can play time and again then it is worth the investment.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Joe still has it. The ability to make wonderful music. You won't be disappointed with this CD. Buy it now.
B0079IJ0R0|1.0|Item will not load on several different Blue Ray players, by the time I realized it was defective I had gone over the deadline for returns and Movie Mars would not honor the return
B009CPGZFS|5.0|It was great. A little predictable at the very end but still worth the watch. I have enjoyed all of the seasons so far
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I found myself shifting back and forth from the guilty/not guilty verdict. This book held my interest right up until the last page.
0765325950|4.0|The ending may be slightly lacking for the sheer volume of this series, as I felt there were still some unanswered questions/plot lines; but after waiting years for this final book, I was still very pleased.  The book picks up almost right from the get go, and doesn't let go until the end.  After all the time I had invested in this series, it is nice to finally have reached the end, even though I felt a little more could have been done with the story.
0307961435|5.0|This one volume offers two key works by one of the finest writers of today.  It's a good value in terms of both price and publishing quality.  If you like Barnes, this is one for your library.  Get ready, too, for his newest \\"Levels of Life\\" which is being published in the USA in September.  It's another remarkable book.  As unusual as it is fine.
B0033AX20E|5.0|For any DragonForce fans out there who don't own this CD, I would say it is a must.  There is a lot of diversity in the song selection and tempo of the tracks.  For a debut album (albeit a re-mastered one), I don't think it gets much better than this!
B002CMQS1O|5.0|Amazingly funny. The standard by which all &#34;mockumentaries&#34; are compared. Every other scene has you rolling on the floor with absurd laughter. From &#34;11&#34; to Stonehenge, this will keep you laughing from beginning to end. Fantastic.
B004XISI4A|3.0|A well constructed convolution of triumphant bad guys and good guys who can't cut a break. This fantasy realm almost deserves to be overtaken by winter and white walkers. Some of the descriptive writing gets a bit long winded, and entire pages of the book could be left unread and the reader would not miss a beat in the storyline. In spite of the overarching depressive storyline I cannot wait for the next book.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Is there an actual plot here, or is it just me? Also, he would have done well to consult a linguist so the names would make more sense. I feel like I need a cheat sheet for the characters like the ones they sell with War and Peace. When he introduces a character, he goes into such detail for each one that it's hard to know which is important and which is a minor character. I don't watch the show because I have a young child, but I think the show would be easier to follow.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|My favorite release so far in 2013. If you have been browsing Pitchfork for the last 20 years; not possible but  go with the metaphor,this recording is going to seriously mess with your mind.<br /><br />Paramore packs a phrase, note, or vocal inflection from a hundred different other recordings into almost every track. They sound totally fresh and original, because they have absorbed their musical roots, and turned it into their own creations, but to me, every song is like living in multiple alternate musical universes at the same time.<br /><br />So each song evolves, slowly,  as you sort out the influences, but they sound great from the first play.
B00005JMJG|4.0|This film is a great departure from Carrey's usual funny-man roles while Winslet plays his troubled love among great chemistry. Part sci-fi, part love story and part drama that uses an interesting premise to explore their turbulent relationship. I found it to be a clever, entertaining, and surprising film that may be slow initially yet pays for it with the dream-like and captivating dialogue and sequences. Tom Wilkinson is good in it also. Looking for a movie that's a little different from the standard 'romantic comedy' that are a dime a dozen; one that can keep both spouses watching to the end- this is a great choice.
B000YMDQQ4|5.0|Neil Gaiman is always going to make you glad you read his book.  I can hardly wait for his next one
B004UID2LC|5.0|Used to be a terrible app. Since the last 3 updates its been just friggin awesome!!! Does exactly what its supposed to do. So what if it has ads when you are searching and downloading, the end result is ad free and isn't that what people want? To sum it up in one word, justaawesomefreeapp!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I got the app for my tablet, love the ease of being able to get to where I am going faster
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I respect what Jay Z has done in his life and it has inspired me but Magna Carta is the worst thing that he could have done.  I thought Yeezus was not progressive enough.  All the people who think the beats are garbage are way too simple minded to be addressed.  Kanye's lyrics are childish a lot of the times but the beats were finally coming in the direction that abstract hip hop has been traveling for a while now.  After hearing Magna Carta, I think Yeezus absolutely destroys that album and it's not even that good.  Hip hop is dead and now I've finally given up on Jay Z as well.  He simply cannot be progressive even if he tried.  He doesn't have it in him.  I think that's a waste because there is only one life.  Sad times these are...
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Hansel and Gretel is an entertaining film. My whole family enjoyed watching it. The F/X was good, the acting was well done, the sets and action sequences were entertaining. There are multiple comedic moments which makes the movie quite enjoyable.<br />Watch this movie without any pre-determined ideas about it and your sure to enjoy it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great show for the way life use to be.. And the way it turns to the modern Age. Enjoy
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Exciting and realistic. Keeps you engaged . Emotions even though you want England to win are with Faber. Great writing and historically accurate as only Follette  provides.<br /><br />.
0767812166|5.0|Great movie that teaches us that humanity is too eager to judge and fear.  This was a great &#34;feel good&#34; movie with lots of lessons!
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|This movie started slow, but turned out to be excellent.  Good character and outstanding cinematography.  A shame it didn't last longer.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My husband and I loved the second season just as much as the first.  In fact, we were so addicted that we finished the second season in one week and can't wait for season 3!!! An all round series that you can laugh, cry, and cheer, all while sitting on the edge of your seat.  It's the best entertainment with only one regret, that they don't make a new episode each day!  Best actors and writers - needs to get several awards.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I liked the books and truly enjoyed the first three movies that hit the box office.  I don't believe, unless your not a Lord of the Rings fan, they will ever make a movie or set of movies any better than this.  Cheers to Ian McKellan and his crew.  The cinematography was incredible.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This book had depth. It was written in truth. No silly teenage drama. It was two teens trying to figure out where they stood in between their friendship and more. All the while battling judgement from everyone else.<br />Poor Eleanor. I ached for her. From her body, to her hair color, to what she went through at home, to being poor, to the way she dealt with cruelty everyday. It wasn't her fault. She was a victim of circumstance. No one should ever have to live in those conditions or go through what she did. Her mother was to blame. This is another example of someone so dependent on a man that you forget about your kids well being. It didn't even matter. Made me sick.<br />Park. I think he kept her alive by giving her a reason to get up in the morning. Eleanor showed him, not even trying, that it doesn't matter what people think if its important to you. After coming to that realization he began to be okay with who he was. I loved how he was there for Eleanor. Even with all her baggage.<br />The only reason this book didn't get a five star rating was solely because of the ending. It was so abrupt. I had no closure!!! All together a good book though. It's a reminder that we don't know others struggles. Bullying is the last that people need when their home lives are so horrible. This book reminds us that the world needs less hate and more compassion.
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|I wasn't impressed.  Just because the stars came out for this movie there was way too much uncovered.  It kept jumping time in the movie and never really explained anything.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|It brought about all the best and worst of high school.  The clicks, the bullying, the friendships and the high school crushes.  Most of all it wasn't over the top and unrealistic.  It had beautiful talented girls that were very easy on the eyes and the guys were there to round out the story lines.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I loved all the seasons. I got showtime to watch season 8. I wish they were'nt ending it this season.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very challenging keeps you on the edge of your chair and without clues the fingers  are waiting on the brain.
159463176X|3.0|His first 2 books set the bar quite high.  This one is good but it doesn't draw you in like the other 2 did.  Still a good read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The hunger games trilogy was amazing. I couldn't put the books down. I wish they would've went more in depth of how Peeta and Katniss' love caught fire again. Other than that, the author does an amazing job on reflecting poverty and the way their world works as a whole. I love how everyone came together to fight for what they believe  in. Very much recommended !
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I am a Baldacci fan and have been for many years. This book moves right along and draws you in to the plot which is believable. He shows human nature very well and introduces characters very well. I would wholeheartedly recommend!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was challenging. Defiantly so and required math skills, memory, and patience. I made it to level ten, but could not find the things necessary to open the door. Inthe menur it says levels above ten are(coming soon) That may be why I couldnt find the last clue or maybe I just couldnt.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Our seven year old grandson plays it all the time and it fuels his imagination and skill!  He explains it to us and is teaching us to play it.
B00COQKE2M|4.0|dont listen to Alone, they really didnt know which songs to leak before it came out. if there is rap, its only for one verse and the songs are pretty good. I really like It's Over When It's Over
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  I would have liked more functionality in the hidden objects, like opening containers to locate items.  Rather than having the mystery wrapped up by a story scenario, I would have preferred the game let the player complete the story by having a travel adventure to the temple region, another to locate the temple, and another to encounter the temple to accomplish the mission.  Otherwise, I have to say this was one of the better hidden object games!
B004R0YHI0|4.0|Highlights the importance of sticking to your guns on critical issues when trying to correct &#34;wrongs&#34; in the system.  Thank goodness for people like this because this is (it seems) the only way to create meaningful and helpful change in our government..
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Perhaps the most beautiful book I have ever read. The message is profound, the language speaks directly to the heart. I have posted the 4  Agreements where I can see them each morning. I look forward to transforming my current dream to a new life of infinite possibilities. Thank you for this wonderful book
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This was a surprising delight and my new favorite holiday movie. The animation was a stand out for its design and beauty. The story was a heartfelt story about belonging to a family. I recommend this for any age.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the characters and the problems that they face.  Shirley Maclane is wonderful in her role as is Maggie Smith.  they make the series that much better!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Are you serious? Gems for Sweetibelle and Hearts for Scootaloo? The worst part? 90 Gems for Rainbow Dash! Gameloft, change every single character in the store to cost Bits or you have got yourself a riot of angry customers on you!
B001BWDG0W|5.0|The movie was great and it is so much fun to have the soundtrack to listen to while doing other things.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The photography was great. Action was super. Story line was interesting and flowed well. Jennifer showed great acting skills. Entertainment at a higher level.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|The sounds are good, just wish it had a timer so that it could be set to shut off or start up at certain times
B005LHOKFS|4.0|One thing that would make this tool even better would be if there was an easy way to filter by the distance from a particular interstate. Say I am travelling down the interstate and I want to stop somewhere in the next 50 miles but I don't want to have to drive 5 miles off the interstate, what are my options?
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|I had previously purchased or received as gifts the prior 6 movies on DVD - most wide-screen but I think one gift was a full screen version.  I decided I'd like a Blu-ray copy but they were usually around $70 or more for the set so never bought it and I actually had not seen the Deathly Hallows either.  After receiving a gift card I figured what the heck, I'll go ahead and get the 11 disc set that was available at a more reasonable price.  Here's what I noticed after watching all the movie discs (I pretty much had to so I'd remember everything and also to verify the disc were good).<br /><br />First the breakdown of the 11 disc - as mentioned they come in a \\"box\\" that isn't high quality but does the job of keeping the four cases together in a group.  The four cases are labeled so you can see which \\"years\\" are included in the case.  Two of the cases have two disc each, one has years 1 & 2 while the other has years 3 and 4.  The third case has years 5 and 6 with a special features disc for year 6 (Half-blood Prince).  Finally, there's the largest case that holds year 7 part 1 & 2 and the special features for both so a total of 4 discs in this last case.  All of my discs had labels and I didn't have the blank or black label mentioned in other reviews.<br /><br />Quality of movies on Blu-ray - I'd say the first few movies seemed more like DVD copies and the sound was not as good as my LOTR Blu-ray collection.  The later movies seemed better but perhaps that's to be expected with the first movie being from 2001 and the last movie around 2011?<br /><br />As I mentioned in the 11 discs breakdown, only the last three movies have the special features disc included.  The others have minor special features  like trailers, deleted/extended scenes, some actors talking about their characters and such.  I also believe the Half-Blood Prince had the \\"Enhanced\\" movie playback feature but am pretty sure the Deathly Hallows did not.  I'd also mentioned on the first few movies I think they just went right into play mode so if you want to get to the menu you have to use the remote to bring it up to view the minor features or wait until the movie is over and then forward through the credits.  Being the \\"All\\" regions versions means you will see a lot more warnings about the copyright as the screen is shown in multiple languages.<br /><br />So if you are looking for the complete set, don't care too much about having a ton of special features for each movie or if you want a region free version, then this may be the best option for you.  However if you like extended version and want more than you would have seen at the theater or just want to see all the special features or have an attractive storage box/case, then you'll have to look elsewhere.
B0000041Z5|5.0|I purchased this collection because I have just a couple of Brahms' works.  It's great, and I'm finding that I really enjoy his style.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Finally a book filled with non stop sex, plots, twist and turns.  Can't wait till the next book arrived, will re-read the first three just because I love Eva, Geidon & the many loves they left behind
B005X5XIL0|5.0|I've watched, but did not purchase, several Bocelli concerts; however, when I watched this one on public TV, I had to have it.  His performance was great, as usual, but I gave five stars because of the strength of his guest artists.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|This is one of the first renditions of Hansel and Gretel that I can say I  really enjoyed.  Which Hunters they are and the imagination and the creations of all the witches was really realistically portrayed.  In an imaginary way.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it. So glad they are working on Season 4. I can't think of anything more to say but I must have at least 20 words. (That's silly -- brevity is good)
B004OO4UFY|4.0|I was searching for something new to listen to and came across The Heavy. The sound is great - A little gritty which is just the way I like it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like the way Sylvia writes.  I enjoy the characters in this series, I want to know more about several of them.  A few good twists but an unsatisfactory ending.
B0094LUH4A|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  The story is of love. . That in the end does not always end the way you think.  Wonderful old movie.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I'be been a fan of magic for years best card game ever easy to learn and hard to master. This version of the game is good but the only thins keeping it from five stars from me is the fact that you have to have someone with bluetooth to play with online. One other thing is wizards again forgot to add the plainswalker cards to the game. After all it is called dukes of the plainswalkers.
0440246318|5.0|In this story Reacher's hitchhiking lands him in a situation with a kidnap victim and a couple of shady characters who may be terrorists, assassins, or mobsters.  FBI, State Department, and CIA are all involved to some extent.  A lot of twists and surprises as the book evolves.  Cold war relics from the 50's/60's are a significant factor in the story.
B009O2XY12|5.0|It's fun and easy to play. This is a relaxing game. We enjoy this game so much, especially since it's kid friendly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|You start with 10 games and unlock more after completing them.  Most games resemble games from the past and can be fun for young and young at heart.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|I enjoyed the movie, but the play back was not good.  Very pixely (if that is even a word), and not clear at points.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|this was written poorly..had a lot of potential with the cast but really was just dumb.  I like Farrell, Rudd and Carrell so it was a bummer they got such a lame scrpt.
B004ZJZQH4|5.0|To me, the most tears-in-the-throat moment was this:  After days of agonizing uncertainty, the capsule has re-entered the earth's atmosphere, the heat shield has held, the freezing astronauts are shown being thawed out by the reentry friction (huge relief and first sense of safety for them!), the parachutes have successfully opened, they are bobbing in the sea, and frogmen have jumped into the water.  When the designated diver (heh) hauls himself up the outside of the capsule (which looks really difficult) and thumps on the window, I can only imagine his sense of history and relief when he gets a thumbs-up from Lovell inside. I'd give anything to interview that guy!<br /><br />Two minor quibbles, both regarding the Florida vs. Texas situation:  I've watched this movie maybe a dozen times and I always had a negative feeling toward Marilyn Lovell when she tells Jim she might not come to the launch.  Jeez, lady, your husband is leaving the planet and might not ever return and you're whining about the children's schedules when the occasion is, as I hazily thought, nearby?  It was only this last time when I watched it that I realized the launch was at Cape Kennedy, Florida, over a thousand miles away from Houston where all the astronauts lived - she had to fly there and take serious time away from her children, not just skip across a parking lot like the movie made it seem.  Am I the only one thinking that maybe the audience should have been reminded/informed of this?  Made her seem selfish when she wasn't.<br /><br />By the same token, the movie made a big dramatic deal about Ken Mattingly solitarily witnessing the launch in person, and we can see his obviously custom-made car that he's arrived in.  Are we to surmise that he drove over a thousand miles just to torture himself by watching in person and then, necessarily driving 14-15 hours back home, just in time to be present for the Houston emergency?  I guess he *could* have flown and then rented such an expensive car.  Artistic license that I'm positive never happened.<br /><br />I also deplore the Universal Blue-Ray release load time, but the movie looks good and the extras are good, so no points away from a truly fine and inspirational movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  It makes you think.  It is hard but not impossible to figure out.  Sometimes I would get stuck on a level and quit - but when I played again later with a fresh view I was able to find things I overlooked previously.  I was disappointed when I finished because I wanted to search more rooms!!!  Can't wait for updates - and I have never said that about a game before.
B00BDSRISA|3.0|With their 4th release, it looks like Phoenix is starting to run out of steam. Of course, 3 spectacular albums are three more than most bands have, and this one is ok. But it's just ok. The staple of Phoenix songs has always been their catchiness mixed with clever lyrics, and while the lyrics might still be up to par, after listening to this all the way through several times, nothing really sticks in my head (in a good way).
B00AR83PN4|3.0|Cubes were hard to control, difficult to determine what square they were assumed to do into. Decided not to keep.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My husband and I stream our video; have for the past 2 years. We love it when we find a series where we can watch entire seasons. (Then there's the long wait for the next season to become available... but that's ok - no commercials!) Character and plotline developments have added continuity.<br /><br />The main characters are perfectly cast. Harvey, Mike, Jessica, Rachel, Donna and Louis are great. As I write this review, we are three episodes from the end of Season 2. We're guessing at what's coming next simply by reading the episode titles - and we may be correct - but it's not spoiling the fun. Speaking of fun, Rick Hoffman, who plays Louis Litt, is stellar.<br /><br />Another thing that we love - we didn't know this was on Amazon Prime, and were waiting for the DVDs from Netflix - no more! Amazon Prime rocks. We've found some other series that have been in our Netflix queue, and are very happy to find them here. No more waiting.
B00935KWWO|4.0|The Twitter app is clunky at best, this app is much better at providing a good experience on the social network.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I liked it alot, I just wish it was a little harder and had more puzzles to solve. It as easy but the storyline was great and the graphics awesome.one of my favorites!!!
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Schwarzenegger still makes good action movies.  This movie is no &#34;Die Hard&#34; action flick--but it gets the job done.  Pretty interesting mix of actors in this movie:  Forrest Whitaker, johnny Knoxville, and Genisis Rodriguez (very hot).<br /><br />solid action flick.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great story told through the eyes of the dog, tug of the heartstrings but still couldn't put it down....great ending
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Great album hands down. One of the best bands there is! Great lyrics and instrumentals. I can't wait for Breaking Benjamin's next album.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved reading this along with the the audiobook I downloaded from Audible.com....the voice actor gives each character a distinct voice, every page felt like watching an epic movie. This is also credit to the strikingly vivid images that Martin cajoles with his writing. I highly recommend you experience the adventure for yourself.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I always need a calculator nearby whether I am computing the difference between yards and meters for knitting projects or the many other conversions I am faced with everyday. This is a great calculator and easy to work with.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I was leery of watching this, since I have never been a big Hannibal Lector fan. However a friend convinced me to watch it and I have no regrets. Hannibal is one of the best TV shows out there. Mads Mikkelson, who plays Hannibal Lector, gives the role a unique human quality, making you almost empathize with Hannibal Lector. Will Graham, played by Hugh Dancy, is the one you want to save but at the same time, see succeed on his own. Laurence Fishbourne plays a captivating Jack Crawford. Smart, solid, and ruthless. This show made me never want to stop until I finished, and the finale came as a shock.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have always enjoyed Mahjong and love this game version. There are many levels available along with many set ups of the game to choose from.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I watched this movie over and over and have not gotten tired of watching it.  It is exciting from beginning to end.  And fun to watch for everyone (Men, Women, Children).  Great movie!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|For a free App this is  lots of fun. Once you get a little into it, it gets easier. Stick with it and enjoy!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I like the idea that this movie gives of both races (black and white) working together to fight against prejudice.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a nice game for children as well as adults to find pairs and uncover them all. Good for children to find matches.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I really needed a app so I could print from my kindle. Do far I have not had any issues with this app. Many times I forget I need to look up thing in this app to get results. I wish that I could print off a web page or out of my email without always having to look up and print from the app. Still a great app.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Entertaining story, but a bit too computer--technical for my taste.  While the computer-technical was integral to the story, it made for a difficult read.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|This was a great show, and it was unfortunate that it was cut short in its second season.  The second season is a bit rushed, but I could not penalize it for that.  It is still very good with great characters and a solid plot and story arc.  The finale had an ending that I didn't expect, but was very tender and endearing.
B004XISI4A|4.0|WOULD NOT LOSE BY LAYING OFF DETAILS OF CRUEL SEX. GREAT PLOT(S)  AND EXCITING FINALE TO THE SERIES. MUCH ENJOYED
0743539478|5.0|Dan Brown's books are always good. Have to admire his research.<br />The audio books are good company on long trips.<br />His books appeal to a large audience. Later teens to later years.<br />I discovered I had purchased this audio book once before but enjoyed hearing<br />It again with a new listener. We were only on chapter 76 when we concluded<br />Our trip and she did not want to take the remaining cd's<br />With her- she was going to the library to check out the book to finish the story.<br />In this age of downloadable books and various players, I still like the audio cd books.<br />A good read, a good listen.
B001DTWJRE|3.0|It can too late for Father's Day and had received the book from Walmart on time. I have your copy(s) and the Walmart Book received by Father's Day. How many do I need?? You should pick up. It took too long.
B005544TRQ|5.0|really enjoy this show...the story outline starts getting repetitive but that's okay at least they aren't too soft (like Drop Dead Diva or too dark like SVU) ...the characters are fun.
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|This Blu-ray version has much better sound and a lot cleaner picture than the original 1982 DVD pressing. I am glad to add it to my collection.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Of course I saw the movie first and decided to read the novel. Believe it or not, I actually liked the movie a little bit better, but that might be because J-Law and Bradley Cooper are AWESOME. One thing that I really liked in the book over the movie was the narrator's voice. Also in the book, Pat's mother has way more depth/strength as an individual and his father has a completely different characterization. Some of my favorite comedic nuances from the movie are missing from the novel, only to replaced by others that are still amusing. It's a great read and I plowed through it in like...a day.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|Another big win for Hans Zimmer. This sosundtrack is unique yet still recognizable as one of his great works. It's filled with epic emotion and gives me shivers every time i listen to it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was so good. Well-written and comes together like magic. GAH. I've been recommending this to all of my friends. It's so good!
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I enjoyed the era this story started in. I felt so bad for him in the very end.  Great story.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I have purchased G5 games before and loved to play but $4.99 is a little much that is why I'm giving only 4 stars instead 5 .
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best show not on television.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|As usual, I am not disappoint with the quality or performance of this product made by Marware. Highly recommend it because you can feel the quality and it's built strong.  Color is nice.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I would actually rate it 3.5 stars, but since there are no halvsies on Amazon, I'll up it to 4. It was hard to put down, but not an extraordinarily compelling read. Still very good and would recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Stay exited for the next update there will be endermen, breeding,wolves,dogs,villages, villagers, Redstone button, lever, pressure plate, hopefully iron golem, fish , fishing rods and I think that's all
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I am totally addicted to this app. I get so excited to see what I will create next. Fun, no matter your age or ability.
086571701X|5.0|Book came quickly and was in perfect condition. This book takes you through Aquaponic Gardening step by step. It even has some color photographs. I love the book and this was a great transaction!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|There is something amazing and captivating about this series! Entwined with You had me hooked from the first page. I really wasn't sure if this one was going to be rushed like some others are by the time they get to book #3. And it was not! I honestly can not wait until Captivated by You comes out. This series has been worth every penny I spent, every hour I lost not sleeping and every great review! Great job, Ms. Day!!
B005LAIIMG|4.0|World War Z is a movie about United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Pitt) who traverses the world in a race against time to stop the Zombie pandemic that is toppling armies and governments, and threatening to destroy humanity itself.<br /><br />I recently watched this in the theater and I enjoyed the movie, even though it had a major rewrite, 6 month delay and supposedly strayed from the book. To me, this movie reminded me of a cross between Resident Evil and I Am Legend, incorporating elements of both. I am not so familiar with the book that WWZ is based so I cannot judge how closely or how far it strays from the book but like most movies the moviemakers rarely stick closely to the original book it is based.<br /><br />After reading about the original filmed ending being based in Russia with a harsher and more bleak, I was curious if that ending would have worked better than the one on the big screen now. Based on the description, I am not sure it would have been better but would have given some food for thought.<br /><br />WWZ differs from Resident Evil's zombie kill them all style of storyline and a little less emotional storyline than I am Legend (I like I Am Legend a bit better). I would say that it fits somewhere in between, which doesn't make it a bad thing as I liked the storyline even though it seemed the rewrite was set up strictly to create a sequel possibility if the movie did well, which looks like that will happen.<br /><br />Some people will not think this a good zombie movie due to the lack of zombie fighting going on but I thought the approach was good and entertaining, Instead the movie focuses on finding out what caused the zombie disease so a cure could be found. I thought that idea brought something new in the zombie realm of movies.<br /><br />Even before I read about the rewrite, I did feel that some parts were cut and abrupt a little and could have been done a bit better. I felt the movie was a bit disjointed as well at times and you can definitely tell that the movie is a product of multiple rewrites and 2 directors which hurts the film.<br /><br />I thought the lack of character development was also a weakness of the movie as there was little in that realm that kept me emotionally attached to the characters. Something that I am Legend does much better.<br /><br />The Zombies themselves seemed realistic and scary and even up close such as the lab scene the makeup and acting of the zombies were well done.<br /><br />WWZ is not perfect but is definitely a good movie to watch that despite some flaws that I enjoyed watching. It kept me entertained throughout even with its problems and although it strayed from the book, this movie is entertaining for what it is.ely tell that the movie is a product of multiple rewrites and 2 directors which hurts the film.<br /><br />I thought the lack of character development was also a weakness of the movie as there was little in that realm that kept me emotionally attached to the characters.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love the game l can't stop play it on my Kindle Fire HD You all needed to try it You all love it it's really fun. Thanks again l love everything on Amazon.com.<br /><br />Patty Thilman
B00082ZS5W|5.0|Dido is wonderful on stage.  This DVD is extremely well done.  It is as though I was at the concert.  On top of that I got an audio CD in with the DVD.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I wanted a weather app on my ereader tablet and got this one but didn't like it as much as the other ones.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|The dentist was excellent. I don't always like Jamie Fox, except when he portrayed Ray Charles, but he was great in this movie. I love the dialogue in all of Terrentino's movies. However, I wish the violence was less graphic.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is the app my son wanted me to have on my ereader-tablet and I like it very much. Want to see live weather whever I have a need to. Pleased with this.
B00992CF6W|1.0|At first I was excited for the game and then disappointed. To me there's not much to do and it doesn't even let you craft it yourself. To me it's a waste of 7 dollars. Your better off buying survival craft. I don't even play the game anymore.I tried it once and then very mad and just disappointed that I wasted my money.
B008OOYALE|5.0|love it. absolutely amazing. great graphics. totally recommended. well worth your space. love how you can get quests and stuff. gold is not hard to get. awesome game!!!! extremely happy with it.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|It's gritty, though; very gritty (i.e., graphic)!  I would NOT recommend any of these books for school-age kids due to the extremely graphic nature.  Interesting how the author decided to advance only some of the characters in the story.  It does leave you wondering about the rest of them (intentional on his part).  Increasingly difficult to follow the timeline though...just when you think you've got it, Martin switches to another character and jumps back to a previous time (week? month? year?).  This approach, while unconventional, bogs down the plot somewhat.  And I'm sure that in whatever historical frame his books occur, there must be a calendar of some sort....would be nice if he would make mention of it for us poor readers who are trying to figure out the when of his stories.  But having said that, I do love his in-depth character studies and the way in which he individualizes them (Arya thinks everyone and everything is stupid, Sam views himself as craven but keeps having intense - and hopefully eventually transforming - moments of bravery).  Martin's characters are magnetic, not charismatic.  They don't reach out and grab the audience; instead they pull the audience in to identify and connect with them.  I keep thinking that each time I finish one of the books in the series I will switch to another story, but I don't. Instead I just keep getting the next book in the series.....
B008476HBM|5.0|Some books, and this is one, are indifferent to your opinion. They have stood time's test (200 years), have enduring themes (love and money) and believable characters. Your opinion of them says more about you than about the book. So yes, I love it for theme and characterisation and writing that makes Hemingway sound wordy.
B007M45PMU|5.0|The Lumineers are now on my watch list of artists, and I can't wait to add more albums to my collection. Their unique voices, capture a sound that will stay in your head for hours, the first time you listen to them.
B008JFUUQ2|1.0|It's like a glorified karaoke competition.<br /><br />If you like Glee you might like this. If you don't like Glee...you'll hate this, very much in fact.<br /><br />This movie is for people whop actually believe there is a such thing as a cut throat world of singing competitions in college where people dedicate their entire lives to singing and destroying other people's chance at a singing career. Before Glee no one had ever heard of glee club competitions getting so out of whack that people are destroying other people's lives just to get a chance to be the lead of a song that's been sung a thousand times before...and much better by everyone else.<br /><br />Why have musicals gone the way of using everyone else's music? It's just lazy and plays off the \\"hey, I know that song\\" factor. \\"If you like (insert song title here) you'll love this movie.\\" Where are modern day Fiddler On The Roofs or Jesus Christ Superstars? Everything's got to be a glorified karaoke competition where everyone is about to stab everyone and run away crying because their life is over if they don't win sectionals. It's ridiculous.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I had to replace the cable that came with my kindle fire charger because the joint where the cable meets the jack went bad and I never new if the kindle was really charging or not. This cable has a better connection. Since I bought this replacement (actually there were two in the package), I have been glad to have an extra cable more than once because I have several android devices and it works with them all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I never saw this when televised originally, but heard a lot about it.  I'm fascinated by the upper echelon British lifestyle of that century.  Yet the humanism is apparent and I love to see them suffer and love like the rest of us.
