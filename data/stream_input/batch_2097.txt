B002MQYOFW|5.0|I seen the movie & then read the 2nd, 3rd book. So i wanted to read the first book.I think the book is very exciting.I read it every chance i had until i finished the book.Im going to read the 2nd & 3rd over again.  I would recommend this book to all my friends.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this novel. Sparks is fantastic. I love all of his novels. Always captures those perfect moments every time!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and book one. Very excited and looking forward to reading the next installments of this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is really really fun. It almost becomes addicting. One of my favorite parts of the game is all the different characters you can buy. The limited edition people are super cool. If you want to be entertained, then get this app.
B002NT3B52|5.0|Very interesting. Could be a little less scientific but a very good read.  Not as sentimental as most.  Definitely a good read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is my favorite game now because it's so much fun and so addicting and ever since my friend had shown this game I have played every day after school.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Continues to be the best series on TV.  It is a shame that a season consists of only 8/9 shows.
B0083Z614S|5.0|this book is all of the above. i watched the movie when a was younger and fell in love with the three children. i watched it over and over. when i saw it was for free on kindle i knew i had to get it. i admit i put off reading it because i felt like i already knew the story and would save it for wen i was bord. but one that time came, i couldnt put it down! the movie was alot different from the book which ment i got to read and learn alot more. i will always love this story and will probably end up reading it to my kids in the future &#60;3 for now i will settle for reading to my little sister :) you should really read this if you have not already

B00846REIS|4.0|I loved this book almost as much as fifty shades of grey, so many similarities. I do like that Eva isn't some innocent virgin. And I loved how the sex started out quick. I'm excited to read how Gideon is damaged....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|With all the hoopla in the movie promotion media I was hoping that the book was better. It was many times over. Suzanne Collins has demonstrated a skill in story telling that captures your attention. I willingly gave up more than a few hours sleep to keep reading this story. I am very much looking forward for the next book.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Some of the levels are a bit of a challenge, others are easy. After a while you get bored. But when you are already bored it keeps you entertain. Overall, for the price of FREE, why not. It's worth it. My kids enjoy it too.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|I'm a big fan of &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; compilation disks.  There's a lot of artists out there that I like enough to buy a collection of their best stuff, but not enough to buy ALL their stuff.<br /><br />So, if you're just kind-of a Talking Heads fan, this is a great disk to buy.  Only half-serious about that comment.  It's a great disk, as far as I can tell, it has all the &#34;radio hits&#34; on it, and quite a bit more, actually, a lot more for a single disk.  To me, this disk reads like something that is intended to be &#34;sure you like THOSE songs, but listen to THESE OTHERS, and if you like THEM, maybe you'd like to pick up the full albums?&#34;.  To me, that's a great way to set up a disk, and the Talking Heads disk does that.

And for so long!<br />Your story showed me that we are all strong enough to cope with anything, if your survival instinct is intact.<br />I commend you on coming out and being so honest with your story.<br />I hope your life from now on is bright and full of wonder, and that your daughters see the beauty in the world and in themselves.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Great entertainment. Probably could be suitable for younger (than rating suggests) boys who like robotic toys except for the one scene where Hugh Jackman gets the snot beat out of him in front of his boy for not having paid a gambling debt. The rest of the violence was robot on robot so it wasn't carnage or vicarious carnage. I don't remember any bad language at all.

B004EPZ034|1.0|The DVD gets as far as the beginning credits and freezes. I made sure it was not my dvd players in the house because all are farely new, so that was not the problem.  The dvd would just freeze. I had to hide it because my daughter would cry when the dvd freeze. She has a mental disability and doesnt understand when I tell her that the dvd is not working right. It would be nice to have this purchase replaced with a new dvd due to my special circumstances.

B0043U7XJO|4.0|I've decided I like Russel Crowe movies.  Time after time he delivers good solid action that is actually driven by a reasonably compelling, albeit not overly complex, story.  Between this film, Master and Commander, Gladiator, and his recent work in Les Miserables he has a penchant for films with historical interest which appeals to me.<br /><br />On that note, this film delivers - Good historically correct feeling battle scenes, political intrigue rooted in true history, and an ah-ha moment at the end when you realize you were watching a sort of... wait, I don't do spoilers.<br /><br />To wrap up, I give this movie a 4 out of 5 because it delivered on my expectations quite well.  Make some popcorn, settle in for some good entertainment.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I prefer live streaming current content and it does not do that well.  Good for catching up but I am getting away from news sites because it is all negative biased . . . that is what makes news.

1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed the book and I think it further  gives proof of better things to come. Hopefully unbelievers will read it and get a different perspective on why we are here on earth. It was an eye opener and very interesting reading.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|The whole family can enjoy this one. My five and three year old keep asking to see it again, they did find it a little scary, but nothing to worry about. We will buy this one for sure.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is amazing. Like period. When I first started playing it and I saw that I had to swing down a rope I knew it was going to be better than Temple Run was. And don't get me started on my reaction when you go through the mines. Mind officially blown :). This is good stuff.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I can't put my finger on it, but I just found myself thinking of what else I could be doing instead of watching this movie.<br />The kids did like it (3 & 5), but the have not asked to see it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Good story but the grammatical errors and the way it ended knocked it down to 3 stars. I did like that I wasn't sure how it was going to end until over 1/2 way through the book. I like books that keep me guessing. Saying that as soon as I got a little further in I had the end figured out. I didn't want to read any more and quickly skimmed the rest of the book to see if I was right. It's a pretty long book and I read it in one day. That should tell you something. This won't turn me off from reading anything else by the author, but I hope she doesn't rush the endings of all her books. (less)
0385512058|4.0|This book falls into that category of business books that you can quickly scan different areas as you go through and take the best parts and leave the rest. It did feel a bit bloated in certain parts and there were a few too many personal stories - though good and applicable to the point the authors were making - for my tastes.  If you'd like a good networking book with a 'you can do it attitude' this is a good choice. I also had a guest feature it at 27Goodthings.com as a good read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|good story line & follow up to Fifty Shades of Grey. I found very interesting  story line though not so much sex was needed
1400067820|1.0|Taleb says that of the many languages with which he is familiar that there is no word for anti-fragile. That is because there is no such thing as anti-fragile.<br /><br />I was genuinely interested in learning about anti-fragile things; things that gain from disorder. However I was disappointed. Taleb gives plenty of examples of natural selection, survivorship bias, serendipity, diversification, dumb luck, spurious correlations, and even a few things that benefit from just the right amount of stress (not too much, not too little, just a Goldilocks amount of stress). But nothing that is genuinely anti-fragile.<br /><br />As an options trader myself, I was attracted to Taleb's books because he is a former options trader. I must admit I did find \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" mildly interesting even though it was just a several hundred page pitch book for his (now defunct) hedge fund.<br /><br />Taleb's triad of fragile, robust, anti-fragile is just wrong in relation to options trading. Taleb states that being long option volatility is anti-fragile, and being short option vol is fragile and being neutral options vol is robust.<br /><br />Traders don't blow up because they are short vol. Traders blow up because they are short vol AND their position size is too large. Most traders know from the Kelly Criterion that even with favorable bets you will eventually blow up if you bet size is too big. Long short or neutral.<br /><br />If Taleb does not know this is then I suspect this is why he is a former options trader.<br /><br />Likewise with the Black Scholes formula. No one ever blew up because of this either. In fact, it is well known that many traders have made a lot of money from this formula, or early versions of it. Again position size is of utmost importance. Too big, you blow up. Taleb's frequent rants against this formula and Robert Merton become tiring very quickly.<br /><br />He says that time is the enemy of the fragile. This is probably true. So why then does Taleb classify a street-fighter as anti-fragile when the long term outcomes for street-fighters are not good. Street-fighters at best end up in jail, and at worst...I hate to think.<br /><br />This leads me to my next problem with this book. Taleb all of a sudden thinks he is tough and imagines himself beating up fellow conference speakers and abusing limo drivers. Taleb look in the mirror (and I know you are reading this), you are a paunchy, balding, gray old man. You are the opposite of tough. Dare I say you are anti-tough?<br /><br />Normally I would not write such things about an author, but in this case the author has been extremely and unfairly critical of so many people that he deserves it.<br /><br />Taleb says that \\"gym rats\\" (his word for people who regularly workout in the gym) are pretty much useless outside of the gym. How can he possibly assume this? My friends who are \\"gym rats\\" also actively participate in some or all of the following: running, swimming, surfing, boxing, martial arts, football, basketball, and snowboarding among other things.<br /><br />I am mystified by his tirades against universities. He claims that nothing much was ever discovered in a university and gives the example of Steve Jobs not being a university graduate and he has designed many wonderful devices. I am pretty sure Mr Jobs did not go out to his garage and cobble together an iPad out of spare parts. I suspect Apple had hundreds of university educated people that were able to help turn Job's ideas into reality. I bet they even had some Harvard business graduates to help run the business.<br /><br />I note that Taleb holds a position with a university. Given his intense dislike of these institutions one can only assume that he needs the money.<br /><br />If you want to follow the investment  performance of the black swan gurus then check out \\"Horizons Universa US Black Swan ETF\\".

0985081821|5.0|The Forever Girl is fresh, dark, and riveting. I absolutely love paranormal stories especially the ones that have a splash of romance so this was perfect for me!  We follow Sophia, a practicing Wiccan and waitress. Casting spells, fighting evil demons and staying out of the immortal council's vantage point are all in the bargain with this girl. Her head is also racked with a fuzzy sound from casting spells wrong, but that is all in the day! We get to meet Charles, the handsome man she falls for inconveniently. It's really fun to see them develop into what they become (love the romance of course!) But essentially, I would suggest this book (and already have) to any want a dark and mysterious novel that will keep them hooked from first page to last. Thanks for a great read!
0446580848|2.0|Drawn out, boring John Corey novel where his wisecracks really grated on me.  Coupled with the fact that DeMille neglected to do any character development as in The Lion.  There is little action until the very end in this totally far fetched book.  Didn't have a heart to give one of my favorite writers one star.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Stunning visuals mixed in with action, suspense and imagination. Scary to imagine if this were one day possible..This is a perfect movie to watch on a big screen..

B009ME47H2|2.0|This does record your voice if you talk at your Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\". Unfortunately, playback at full volume is very faint and, therefor, not practical. I could copy the WAV file from my KFHD8.9 to my desktop PC and normalize the volume with a sound editor, but that's inconvenient for the casual purposes I have in mind. All the settings options (including recording level) are locked until you upgrade to the pro version. So, this app is free, but kind of a waste of time if you want to decide whether to get the pro version given that there is no guarantee that the pro version will record at a usable level. Free software should excel in at least one important area and be useful for at least something. This free app does not excel at anything and is not useful. Perhaps it works better on phones than on the KFHD8.9.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Movie was good.  Amazon needs to improve online picture quality...not worth $3.99 to watch a mostly dark,  grainy SD movie. I'll wait for a trip to Redbox next time...
0316182060|5.0|Aligns with the novel and the artwork is well-done. I would recommend this to fans of the series. It fleshes out the characters well. My only regret is there wasn't enough Lord Akeldama. What a fun character he is with his little minions about town :)
B00AXVIFSA|5.0|Wish I could just pay for all of Season 3 at once and not have to pay each episode.  Worht every penny as i cant seem to remember to watch it on PBS for free.
B000OW8DW6|5.0|One of the most moving visually stunning movies of all times. This movie illustrates, to me, what things are really important in this world. People wonder through life, climb mountains, ponder endlessly about the meaning of life. It is so simple. The meaning of life to to pass on life.

B003E8P9G0|5.0|thats all I can say about this book, when I first started reading his books I knew I would read every one he wrote and I have, he is a great writer has interesting storylines always.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I am so pleased with this show that I had to have the complete second season.  I read the book and I am delighted that they are staying within the lines of the writer. It is a great book series and appears to be the same with the TV series.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|read this book and it was the same as the movie or the series that I saw a good read from cover to cover
0525952616|5.0|This was a great read!  It had great flow and the plot always kept your interest.  In many ways it reminded me of a James Bond film.  The story was always going in directions you wouldn't expect and you scenarios were amazingly creative.  I can honestly say that Daniel Suarez did things with this story I would never have thought of.  At the same time, the story is a grim reminder of the power of increasing technology.  If you enjoy tech or thrillers, I would definitely suggest you read this.  I know I will be looking for more books by Daniel Suarez!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|again one of rick riordans masterpiece sagas it is great reading I love to read his books but go through them faster than he can write them.

B00B2166BS|3.0|Edited 11-Feb 2013:<br />It must be difficult to design a magnetic safe cable that balances the ability of the magnets to stay attached during normal use with their main safety feature that prevents accidents that could damage the device. When I received this item, it frustrated me because the magnets seemed to detached much easier than Apple's MagSafe connectors do under normal circumstances. I wasn't happy with the item, and Town Communication was extremely helpful and courteous, and swiftly sent a replacement. The performance still isn't as good as I would like, but I will keep trying to adjust my usage habits to prevent unwanted detachment.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game isn't for everyone, but it is indeed really fun for those of us who do enjoy- puzzle jigsaw games and matching. I like how, you have to pay very close attention, or you'll match the wrong ones. This is very addictive, and can make you easily loose track of time. Very clear and vibrant on the Kindle fire HD 8.9'' Love it!<br /> I give Mahjong Deluxe HD, A whopping 4 stars. The reason it's missing one is because, at the end of every game, when your being scored, (WARINING: Dont tap your screen right when your game ends or you'll end up, either on Amazon, or the app store.) Ther are anoying blurry-ish, advertisments, botthers me, sooo much! You don't even know. Overall, it's a very enjoyable game, to us jigsaw addicts, and be carefull! You'r being timed!

B007EECSFA|5.0|I am a huge Kate Morton fan! I didn't think it was possible that I could love one more than the last! She is amazing, her descriptive vocabulary, makes the pages come alive. Her ability to write such dramatically different, beautifully crafted characters is truly a gift. I was so wrapped up in this book! I could probably go ahead and read it again right away.

0425252868|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in aviation history.  The chapter covering the title incident was one of the best combat narratives that I've read. The author gave some good insights into the personalities involved especially the Luftwaffe pilot.  It gave me a renewed appreciation of the sacrifices made by the airmen in the 8th Air Force during WW2. Without giving the story away, it was interesting to see how the heroic actions of a couple honorable men impacted the lives of others.

B0010SKUYM|4.0|The writing is very good, and it makes up for the lack of a plot.<br /><br />The build-up in the first few chapters is excellent, and that is the best part of the book. There is a huge story to tell for sure, but when you finish the book, you wonder why the author did not bring it to some appropriate point when he decided to end the book. The ending is abrupt - the author ends the book arbitrarily, and without bothering to give Book 1 a story arc of its own. But the writing keeps you going, and the prose makes you want to try the next book.<br /><br />Towards the end, Kvothe becomes a rather trying character. His lady love is painful, as is the Draco Malfoy equivalent. Kvothe the innkeeper is so much better than Kvothe the kid.<br /><br />Overall, much better than most highly-rated fantasy books published in the past decade or two. Liked it better than Mistborn. It would have earned a 5 had the story ended well.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This processor is a beast. The hottest it has ever gotten for me is 70c with the stock cooler for anyone who is wondering. This thing handles every new game on the market at high settings with no problem at all. For example Planetside 2, Dayz, diablo 3, league of legends, starcraft 2, wow. Those are just a few. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
B00475AYJQ|2.0|After Book 1, my expectations were high. Only to be dashed to the ground. To think that I had recommended this author to people! But Name of the Wind was good. Very good.<br /><br />Yes, the writing is still very good, but that's about all there is to this thousand page Book 2. The first half of the book is a rehash of Book 1. The second half is a set of disparate episodes that fall way short of the promise Book 1 showed. They can be safely excised without significantly affecting the overall plot (I assume there will eventually be a plot). And there are places where it feels like a 50-page episode was deleted and replaced by a 50-word passage. Jerky. However, I liked the world in some parts of the book. Adem, for instance, seemed the sanest place in the world.<br /><br />The author's sole intent seems to be to put his protagonist in as much misery as possible, and then concoct something to show that he is awesome. The episodes the author puts him through fall way short on credibility, and are often shallow and amateurish. And the protagonist has become insufferable. I no long care what happens to him, but we already know that he lives because he is the one narrating the story.<br /><br />And why this sudden obsession with sex? Large parts of the book are devoted to Kvothe cavorting with most major female characters other than grandmothers. Its a mess after he meets Felurian. You know as soon as a woman character enters that she is going to have sex with him. Yuk. Feels like Nick Carter novels of old. Those chapters are unbecoming of an author of Rothfuss's stature. They belong to some third rate erotic novel.  I skipped all the parts where his lady love appears.<br /><br />I think I overrated the author's ability to construct and tell a story when I reviewed Book 1. The plot in this second book is pedestrian. It meanders as the author rambles (in wonderful language, I admit). I wonder if it is an attempt to milk the franchise. Plot wise, a reader can skip this bookand go on to the final book of the series. Just visit wiki to fill yourself on Book 2's story. That will take all of 2 minutes.<br /><br />This is going the same way as the Inheritance Cycle. Downhill. Great first book followed by increasingly pedestrian tomes. I wonder if success makes authors complacent and editors lame. This book is a waste of money and time.<br /><br />I am not sure if I will read the final book.

B008M0UTRO|3.0|Although this film comes from Studio Ghibli, do not expect the usual fantasy or magical realism of Hayao Miyazaki. Poppy Hill is a drama that just so happens to be animated, a relatively common thing in Japan, which takes its anime very seriously.<br /><br />The film is mostly about Umi - her role in saving the clubhouse, her heartbreak over the death of her father, and the reconciliation of that pain through Shun entering her life. Poppy Hill is very much a \\"slice of life\\" film, one that shines in the small spaces, the usual meticulous attention to detail we come to expect from Ghibli, but is rather bland in the way of plot. There are touching moments, too, but nothing in the way of dramatic twists or emotional impact.<br /><br />I suspect that this film has far more relevance to people in Japan, as there are references to the Korean War, which had a much different impact there than in the West, and to the 1964 Olympics, which was hosted in Tokyo to much national pride. For those not steeped in Japanese culture and history - as I am not - there is not much *to* Poppy Hill, except to enjoy the gorgeous animation and to peer through a small window into a very specific time in Japanese history.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wasn't so sure about the first one but after finishing it I needed to know what happened next. I would say more but I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read it yet. Enjoy!
B004132HZS|5.0|Even as a fan of the &#34;one and only Sherlock Holmes &#34; , I found the reimagining intriguing.  It kept to the basic cornerstones of  of Conan Doyles masterpiece true. - It is all about logic and Holmes' almost mythical qualities of deduction, his legendary lack of polite behavior, and the Holmes -Watson dynamic of caring/exasperation, etc. It plausibly updates changes in the modern day (cells, mass media, and celebrity followings). I have read all Doyles books on Sherlock, and own the BBC dvds, so have long been a fan of Sherlock as we've known him. But, this is fresh and original. I get to sit and judge..Oh! nice job or...gimme a break. It reminds me of another breakaway from the &#34;gospel&#34;. JJ Abrams Star Trek movie and original series. Very origianl yet kerping the spirit of it's prototype..
B009NH6AOQ|1.0|Only giving 1 star because I ordered & paid for the THIRD SEASON early Dec. along with the previous 2 as a Christmas gift. I purchased the DVD knowing that this would be on backorder, but, to date I have not received the DVD nor have I been given an idea as to when to expect it.  It would be nice to know when I might receive it.  [[ASIN:B009NH6AOQ The Walking Dead: The Complete Third Season]]

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely adore this show and just happened to stumble across it right before getting ready to teach WWI to my students. I used clips from the seasons in my lessons, and the kids were really able to connect with the characters. I already loved the show, and that just made it all the better!

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It is well worth the money. it even have more in the app then the CP. I know it is awesome. trust me ucwillcbe hooked
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I spent many hours in 2008 watching congressional hearings on CSPAN, and researching terms like MBS, CDO, CDS, etc. on the internet. I can say conclusively, what is in this documentary is fact, not the fiction you hear on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, CBS, NBC, ABC, etc. Everyone should watch this documentary.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This case provides good protection for my ipad and isn't too bulky. The keyboard is going to take some time to get used to though. Its kind of hard to type on, but its still better than the touch screen keyboard.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|It's amazing how much was written without actually progressing anything to a satisfactory plot point.<br /><br />I'll admit that at first the series was intriguing and novel in approach, but it's now gone to a point of bloated ridiculous.  Too many characters, too much focus on things I couldn't give two sneezes about, all the while seeming to completely blitz over the characters (and plots) I liked accepting of course that the author didn't kill them first.<br /><br />In truth I've spent more time thinking about how I'd have liked the series to this point to be written than finding merit in how it was actually written and prayed for the first time in my known life that the Television adaptation of this now monstrosity severely edits it into something manageable and far more enjoyable for it.<br /><br />I honestly don't think I'll buy the next book, as much as on a point of principle for how annoyed I am with how this book was written.
B000WO251Q|4.0|I'm a new reader and this is my 4th book of Nicholas Sparks, but as many here I got frustrated with the story and where it was going I could not understand why.<br />I don;t want to give any spoilers but I don't understand why give the book less stars and the author, I think he did his job this is my 4th book of his and you start to see a style and if you read the same person over and over it's because you like the style, but he does do some twists.<br /><br />I was surprised how this book gave me so many emotions and for that I give the author 5 stars, but I got sad, I cry I got mad,I'm still mad I'm still with no answers.<br />But it's a good book? Hell yeah  do I wish was different oh yeah but I'm not a writer NP is.<br /><br />What is good is the paperback versions has book club questions at the end which help me think about maybe was that the questions the author wanted you to have.<br />I liked that they touch the Aspergers subject and special needs. As a mother of a Autistic son I appreciate that.<br /><br />Overall is a moving book.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|this game is really fun but every single shark fact is wrong<br />great white sharks aren't the biggest shark in the world and sharks don't eat people
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is super addicting! although tack and things cost a lot of coins its fun to play when there's time. gems run out fast though.
0743243153|5.0|One of the best books that I have ever read. I recommend to everyone. You do not necessarily have to be contemplating the ultimate questions of your existence to read it; it will benefit you no matter whether you are spiritual or not. Keep it and keep referring to it every now and then or at least that is what I plan on doing.

B0076DELIG|4.0|I have read most of Michael Connelly's books. He has the gift of twisting and turning the story to keep it interesting. Harry Bosch is a hoot, and a jazz fan. Just like me!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I read it in two days. The story line was excellent and it was  written in good taste. As the two before this third , it was enjoyable and sensual.
B001IF277K|5.0|Great battery works well. Received it quickly which was a plus. Fits perfect just as the original one. Will get another if needed.

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is by far my favorite android game.  It is very challenging but at the same time is relaxing to play.  The music and the graphics are wonderful.
B008KE3960|5.0|Unexpected fun. Definitely worth a try, you never know what you might find. Would pay for this one, definitely worth a few bucks. Already spent several bus rides playing this.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Up to his usual best.  Look forward to new titles.  Each book has a new story told as only this writer can tell.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!! its worth it!! its as close as you can get from really having your own horse!!!
B000C4A1EO|4.0|Well, if you're looking for full-throttle speed/power metal, this album isn't gonna deliver, but it's not really as big a departure from the classic \\"Keeper of the Seven Keys\\" albums as people make it out to be.  Yeah, the cover and title are silly, the intro track is whimsical and acoustic (but, also only 37 seconds long), and the final track (of the original) is an acoustic, early 90s pop-metal ballad (which some people are, not inaccurately, commenting is somewhat country-music-ish).  But, what does that leave you?  9 decent metal tracks - a little less metal than the previous albums, but not much; in fact, I kinda feel Keeper Pt. II was a step down (metal-wise) from Pt. I, so this is just the next progression.  And, honestly, I flipped back and forth between songs from this album and ones from Keepers on my computer, and there wasn't a huge difference between a lot of the tracks, although a few here lean more pop-metal than power metal.  But, really, the Keepers albums are a little more pop-metal than their Iron Maiden/Judas Priest influences and the later power metal of Blind Guardian et. al. as well, so - again, not a HUGE difference for Helloween.  Overall the songs are melodic and energetic, if not so much as the Keepers albums, but the presence of Kiske on vocals does make this satisfying for those of us who kind of miss the \\"Keepers\\" sound in the later Helloween (which, however, deliver better on the metalness).  Some of the lyrics are a little silly, but again, that's nothing new for Helloween (Rise & Fall and Dr. Stein on  Keepers Pt. II come to mind, not to mention plenty of stuff in their later years).<br /><br />So, overall - if you want to get into the band, start with the Keepers of the Seven Keys albums, then try some of the later stuff (Better than Raw is a good one).  If you enjoy the band overall, and want more of the Kiske-vocal era, don't let the negative reviews scare you off this one, it's still pretty good, upbeat, melodic metal (if not very heavy).
B008FYZIVY|3.0|The series itself was excellent....The Season 1 DISC.....had many flaws.....and I really didn't know how to send it back and receive full re-imbursement !!!
1612680011|1.0|This is a really interesting, well written book which I purchased for my children after reading a friend's copy.  Unfortunately the seller did not disclose that this was a poor quality copy with a font size that was miniscule.  NOT the edition that I was expecting to recieve.  I won't byu from them again.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Though I grew up with and love the Harry Potter series, I'd put off buying The Casual Vacancy because of the resoundingly lukewarm reviews. I even decided to purchase the Kindle version to avoid paying 25 dollars for the hardcover. I began reading it during a flight to Costa Rica and subsequent downtime on the vacation. I wasn't immediately impressed. The plot seemed so-so and the abundance of characters was really annoying. However, as the novel progressed, I found myself more and more drawn to the characters and their individual (but intertwining) stories. It didn't take long to get me hooked. Rowling does a great job with character development, as well as building the ever-present suspense. Despite what I'd initially thought, none of the eighteen or so main characters ended up seeming superfluous. I cried, laughed, and thought about the book for awhile after finishing it. This, by my standards, is the sign of a truly well-written work.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|couldn't ask for a better game. beautifully done and well worth the price. story line was fantastic and kept me wanting to play to solve it.  I cannot wait for the next one. I highly recommend this game. (kindle fire)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Way more features than I expected. It's really like minecraft now! The only problem is that my study time has been compromised.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|An extended version of an earlier short by Tim Burton from his college days. It was good but I don't know if I would watch it again.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|There are many things that give this knife an advantage over other knives I have.  I love the weight of the knife. The second day I had it, my best friend and I went out into the back yard and cut down about 20 elbow thickness saplings. IN THE WINTER!!! I find that having a heavy knife gives a lot of advantage when it comes to chopping against the grain. I also found that after this saga of destroying my backyard I found the blade was not dull at all and I actually cut myself on the blade while testing how sharp it was. This says a lot about the 1095 by carbon steel. I also found that even in the cold weather and the snow the kraton handle still held up very well. With quarter inch thick steel I was not worried about the tip or the rest of the blade.    There are some cons to this knife. I found that after extended use, some of the protective coating began to wear off around the middle of the knife. Only half a millimeter was actually worn off though. This blade is not stainless steel and will rust over time if not dried after each use and treated properly. This would take two years of wear though. I would recommend that you buy a small tube of mineral oil and work it into the blade about once a month. The tip is also not meant foe combat. It utilizes a drop point blade for maximum strength and a very harsh tip. It is not like the Scharade schf1 that is a combat oriented knife. I would not recommend this knife to anyone in the military or a diver or under water oriented. I would however say that even the roughest of kayakers could use this knife because it does not rust quickly, and as long as you have your mineral oil then you will be fine.    Some people refer to the sheath as “no frills”. I disagree. This knife is very sharp and is very heavy. I found that it held up well compared to other sheaths of other knives that I have had that were more expensive. It is MOLLE compatible and uses a “flip and tuck” belt attachment method. It also has a very hard PVCinternal slot that is pressed and one piece.    So think about it. You are spending 40 dollars and getting a knife that is worth 60 dollars and a sheath that is worth 10 dollars. Quite frankly I was surprised at the quality of the entire setup    In the end, buy this knife and I know that you won’t regret it. If you have anymore questions watch these.  [...]    [...]
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I'm not necessarily a big Adam Sandler fan but the writing and acting in this movie was well done. The pacing is fairly fast and I will have to watch it again to catch all the sight gags going on in the background.
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|I don't get it . Why would a brilliant singer such as Andrea need singers like Jennifer Lopez? oh wait David Foster . Ok now I get it . They want her fans . Not being negative towards Jlo , shes a great business performer. And actually did a fine job here. I don't like writing negative reviews .The old adage \\"if you have nothing good to say \\"blah blah... .  He is an undeniable singer that wouldn't really need the help of a David Foster if it weren't the need for publicity and advertising .  This is a \\"Lets see how can we push Americas buttons cd\\" . A little to transparent . I'd still buy anything buy Andrea Bocceli .
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My Friend First Told Me About This And My Mind Was Like &quot;I Got To Play This!&quot; . I Found Myself Addicted. ITS AWESOME ! I Would Recommend This.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What a great show! No swearing...no nudity...class and entertainment the way it should be!! It's too bad more shows can't come up to the high standards of Downton Abbey!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wonder why? As i am interested in woman feelings I tried found out the roots of this success. After I guess that they found in it all they don' t have in everyday life. The male caracter : a billionaire , age 26, play Bach at piano, pilot helicopter, wash dish, have big and frequent erection. The famale 22 years old, virgin, work at hardware store and jane austen reader. &#34; american&#34; girl, but the only one English literature she read is British. It is so distance of the regular life than women felt this kind of life as a paradise, after eork hard, take care of hunsbands and children, cooking and clean, a cold and formal sex. The book plays its role, it is a way of scape of their miserable life what they must pay for.

B00AA7O22U|5.0|Great action, acting and a great follow up to Expendables 1. Fantastic line up of actors...shows they still got game
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love historical fiction and &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; is fantastic. The viewer gets involved in the lives of the characters as the story illustrates the impact that WW1 had on society. The century-old aristocracy is unraveling and, just as one would expect, there are those who embrace the changes & those who are going down with a fight. Through it all, life still happens: people love, envy, fear, care and die. No matter the &#34;rank,&#34; all people experience the stuff of being human.

B007BFSYMS|1.0|There is no clear instructions on how to program the alarm to come on at the appointed time.  I have tried several time.
B005QUQP76|5.0|Great things about this mouse:<br />Highly adjustable: you can set different keys to each of the buttons on the mouse and even macros, also you can have multiple DPI's (sensitivities) for your mouse which you can switch through<br />Ergonomic: it's very comfortable, even for long-term use<br />Response: the LMB and RMB are both sensitive and require little effort, the wheel requires a bit, but it feels intentional so you can't just bump it, also it seems that it wont become \\"loose\\" over time<br />Cord: it's actually corded so it would be very difficult to damage it on accident<br />Not so great:<br />Number of Buttons: there's 10 inputs (8 buttons, scroll up/down) on this mouse, but you really only get two to program, ex. LMB, RMB, MMB, scroll up, scroll down all stay as themselves, the two buttons in the middle with the lights are primarily used for DPI up and DPI down (DPI setting is indicated by the number of bars), the red \\"sniper\\" button is mainly used to drop your DPI to a low setting for fine-tuning your aiming, so that leaves you only two butons (on the left side above the \\"sniper\\" button) to work with<br />Cross-hair: the cross-hair image on the \\"sniper\\" button has faded after a month of frequent use, it's still a red button, but the white cross-hair image is gone now (I'm now just nit-picking)<br /><br />This is a great mouse for gaming short of pro, if you want more buttons I'd recommend the [[ASIN:B005QUQP8A Corsair Vengeance M90 Performance MMO Gaming Mouse (CH-9000002-NA)]], if you want to just upgrade I'd suggest looking at the R.A.T. gaming mice.<br />NOTE: if you have difficulty with the initial firmware install and update go to this address: forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=104856 it helped me a bunch<br /><br />UPDATE, 1 Year Later (Feb 24 2014):<br />Mouse is still holding up well and continues to see regular heavy use. I've worn smooth some of the surfaces on the sides of the mouse and the \\"sniper\\" button got a little depressed and lost a bit of its return, however it still works just fine. All-in-all still a great mouse and I highly recommend it.<br />Know that there is a newer version of this out now: [[ASIN:B00ARD5410 Corsair Vengeance M65 Performance FPS Gaming Mouse, Gunmetal Black (CH-9000022-NA)]]
B003VANOFY|5.0|These headsets were awesome. I had them for 2 years until they finally died, they would have lasted longer if I didn't sleep with them on or drop them many times. I also used the hell out of them, I play games for about 60+ hours a week and the headset keeps it's charge and sounds amazing. I just ordered my second pair two days ago and just received them today. They are the same as they were before, great sound quality, comfortable fit and volume control/mute button are great. I never had any of the problems that other people describe such as a \\"buzzing noise\\" or \\"cutting in and out\\". The only time the headset buzzes and cuts in and out is when I go into my kitchen and turn the microwave on or walk out into my backyard, they are both on the opposite side of the house from my room. Hopefully these new ones I just bought are as good as my original pair! I will defiantly keep buying these in the future because they are long lasting, great quality, and for 100$ I cannot find another wireless headset with 7.1 surround sound. The other headsets like the Razer Tiamat are 190$ which I do not have to expend.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is an awesome show! It keeps you saying, &#34;Whaaaaat?!&#34; but in a good way :) It's something that hasn't been done before and it's fresh and new... I watched 2 shows so far and I am hooked! To be honest I was hooked after the first one...enjoy!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Love this show, it has great character development and keeps you glued to your seat. Dexter is a show that you really should start watching from season 1 so you don't miss all of his plots.

B004LWZVZM|5.0|The story of Lincoln's assissanition is well known. The aftermath less so. The Conspirator answers all the &#34;what happenned after Lincoln was shot&#34; questions. I recommend this to all teachers as a history filler when teaching about Lincoln.

Feel like it's Kindle's revenge for cheating on books with Facebook. &quot;You used to read on me, now you're always on Facebook. Bwahahaha! Not for long!&quot;
B009NPKTN6|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun.  Whether this music was from your generation or not, it's a fun movie.  The music is great.  The singing of all the actors and actresses is fantastic.  Tom is blow away good!  It's a musical and also humorous.  Definitely a movie I'd watch again.
B005HSL626|5.0|Two years ago my son was here visiting and he had a Table and had this game on it and I played it and loved it and my 84 year old neighbor played it and loves it.  We are pleased we can play it.
B004BRQYJ4|4.0|It brings back the excitement of the movie.  Both girls are great singers! If you like the movie, you'll like this sound track too.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Rented this on a whim and was surprised at how good it was . From the animation to the voice  work and everything in between .

B009NPKTN6|5.0|This movie is all around a lot of fun and really entertaining - not just a chick flick either, my boyfriend really liked it, too (though, I liked it more). If you're a fan of this era of music it's a really nicely done flashback in time. No complaints about the shipping, etc. of the product.
0525478817|5.0|Shipped right on the release date, signed copy, great quality, great story. Can't get any better than this. John Green has created another wonderful read for all ages!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my high score is 11,000 (In distance) it's super fun and very different than temple run 1. if u like challenge this is for u. There is mines and ropes.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fantastic game personally I think it is better than temple run as it has better graphics and you have really cool missions! Overall amazing!¡!
B000AM2L1O|3.0|After all the great reviews on these dolls, I was disappointed that one of our doll's eyes doesn't really open. It will open with a little shake or poke (not the best for teaching my daughter about how to be gentle with babies!). But other than that, it's been good. The problem with the eye wasn't something that happened over time, rather it came that way new. Luckily my 3 year old hasn't noticed the eye issue, so I just kept it. We also have the Melissa and Doug baby doll, but this one gets more play. She just likes this one better, I'm not sure why. It's a bit softer and more cuddly, but they are both about the same size. They can wear the same clothes and use the same \\"gear\\". I was hoping that the doll could wear some of the outgrown newborn clothes we have around the house, but unfortunately it's too small.
0071752854|5.0|To keep it short - The book itself is amazing, I have never heard of this stuff before and it got me into learning more about social frames. The style of writing is pretty easy, even for a young 19 years old entrepreneur with english as his 3rd language. I am amazed of this book and I will recommend to many.<br />Great Job!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So fun easy to use and doesn't freeze<br />It's fun for all ages and allowed you to have the horse you've always wanted without the mess
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book on the hunger games I'm buying it straight away. I think they should Make a game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It was nice my sister enjoyed I did too hoarse are pretty much our favorite animal. We all enjoyed it I give it a thumbs up
2061011306|4.0|Love it. It's big enough. Colors are nice. State Flags are nice. It would have been a five star if it was laminated.

0618918248|4.0|If you really want to cement your faith, I recommend this book. The arguments pointed out in this book are interesting and EXTREMELY long-winded. You kinda have to sift through all of the useless jabber to find Dawkins's actual ideas. Some of them are interesting. But Dawkins shows through this book that he believes science and religion are incompatible. If that's what you believe, you will hate this book (or be forced to believe something different.) Dawkins gives a VERY strong case against the typical interpretation of a 5,000 year old earth and a 6 day creation cycle without evolution or natural selection.<br /><br />What Dawkins terribly fails to handle is the fact that we exist at all! His claim, that the beginning of existence only had to happen once and therefore the odds of it happening without intervention are irrelevant, shakes me as comical. Whether or not we understand how the universe was created is irrelevant. Even my middle school science teachers could say, &#34;science tells me how God did it.&#34;<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Dawkins clearly defeats some of the most basic beliefs a lot of Christians have. However, to warrant a title like &#34;The God Delusion,&#34; Dawkins needs to prove that ALL of the beliefs of God are false. He fails in many, many ways to do that. I used this book to prepare for a Christian apologetics conference and found it very useful. You can use it, hopefully along with some common sense and logic and perhaps some sources from Christian apologetics, to really solidify your arguments against the well-versed atheist or agnostic. Those who are not well-versed, of course, really cannot be helped by logic or argument. Perhaps yelling &#34;YOU'RE GOING TO HELL!&#34; will help them.<br />That is, of course, sarcasm. No one appreciates the sign-holding street corner maniacs.<br /><br />Dawkins calls himself &#34;an agnostic leaning strongly towards atheism.&#34; This book presents his beliefs and the reason he believes them. Hestates that he is trying to convert people from religion to atheism/agnosticism in this book. Unfortunately, his arguments tend to do the opposite, and I appreciate that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think the game subway surfers is a very very very very very very good game I LOVE subway surfers a lot by myia Williams.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is an easy game to play.  One minor problem is that when you don't have any more matches, the game shuffles the remaining tiles.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Story is gripping the language at times is crude While the story is intriguing I would not call it a classic
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|This movie was mostly plotless.  Who were you supposed to root for in this movie? The taciturn hillbilly moonshiners, or the corrupt police? They attempt to make that choice easy for you by making the rep for the commonwealth attorney's office into a villian straight out of a comic book or typecasting 101.  It would be hilarious if it weren't so obvious. There were really no likeable characters to feel any sympathy for.  Yeah, I know moonshine is big again these days for some unknown reason, but this attempt to cash in on the craze really falls flat.  Not enough action, poorly paced, and half the cast mumbling all their lines. Save your money. Once again I decided to take a chance on the oxymoron \\"Action movie --Starring Shia LaBeouf\\", and once again it was a total stinker. Don't rent this piece of crap. How they talked all the decent cast members into starring in this is beyond me.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson finished the Wheel of Time Series. We can all rest easy now that it has finally come to an end.
B0058RTLZU|2.0|I didn't like it because I didn't understand it.  If I ever get a significant IQ boost I'll try a re-read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a great book, wish I would have known about it when I wad growing up!  I think that just about every teen can relate to this book. Must read for teens!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|A touching story is told only through animation and music, it is a lot like a modern version of the old silent films. I highly recommend this to anybody who likes anime or house music. If you want to get a glimpse of what the movie is like search for any of Daft Punk's songs on youtube. The ones with the anime in the background come straight out of this movie.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|In Standing in Another Man's Grave, Ian Rankin continues his excellent series with a heart-pounding mystery about a crime in northern Scotland.  His stories are always well plotted and involve the reader in the scenes of the countryside in a realistic and frightening fashion.  He also gets into the inner workings of his department and the fears he has for his own future as a detective.  Is he still accepted by his peers or will he be brought down by department politics?
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The Time Keeper is a very well written story by Mr. Albom. The story makes you think about time in a whole new way. Everyone should take the time to read this story and rethink what we do with our time. Enjoy the read.
034580404X|5.0|found the book to be very interesting but somewhat boring after the second book.  Found it hard to get motivated to finish it.  I would recommend it because as a whole it was interesting.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I love these series I think it's one of the most original ones out there. I can't wait for the next season to be added to the collection.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|Tones of fun. The game has really good control.I think all those who like McCain will like it. I wish there was a bicycle version.
B004WDRSO2|5.0|I grew up watching this and now my kids get to enjoy the same thing, I think it's great for them!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Very dissapointed. Does nothing at all when I click on the app. Just a blank black screen. Won't load to even play!!
B003L77G8I|5.0|Received in time.  Price was cheaper than other places and I am very happy with this purchase.  It was easy shopping.
0740797719|3.0|Many of the reviewers said this book is the be all, end all. I disagree. I found the instruction to be vague and hard to understand and nothing was all that well explained. Beautiful color reproduction, but all in all, I'd just as soon return this book and get my money back.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Price compared and this purchase was cheaper than other stores.  Received the shipment in time.  No problems with the purchase.  Very Happy.
1933492953|4.0|This book is written for the college student/ professional who already has plenty of art instruction under his belt. The language is sophisticated and I often had to read a passage several times before I was able to absorb it.  I found the style of art to be somewhat monotonous as it was all high contrast and very, very, very detailed backgrounds which I often found overwhelming and cluttered. Nevertheless, the book contains lots of helpful hints for the aspiring film maker/graphic novelist.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Received in time.  Price was cheaper than other places and I am very happy with this purchase.  It was easy shopping.
1427210241|1.0|There is no Kindle edition.  Really, really, really stupid.  Why anger a huge number of fans who would have immediately shelled out the money to buy the Kindle edition?  20 year wait and no Kindle edition???? Did I mention that it was a really, really, really stupid marketing decision.  And, by the way, REALLY, REALLY, STUPID.  YOU STUPIDS!
1451695195|5.0|I read this and bought several issues for libraries.  The author is an expert in his medical field, and worthy of attention.  Scientific explanation of his experience sets it apart from similar recounts.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|When I first heard about this book I thought it was a cookbook. I then listened to a podcast explaining what was in the book, and it really covers learning and mastering different skills and Tim uses cook as a subject to teach this. I am a trained NYC chef and I enjoyed and got a lot out of the book. The material in the book is helping me master Russian, guitar and some other skill sets that help me in life. Like anything you have to actually use the data, but Tim has made this pretty easy. My suggestion is get the book, read and apply it. I won't hurt and worst case you will have some adventures to share with your co-workers.
0425252868|5.0|I found a video of a meeting of these two pilots who survived and I had to have this book.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great show, great first season, it's good a different twist on the Holmes story funny and still has the investigative drama
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it you got yo have it i mean it it is so real looking  you gotta have it i mean it i love this game
B005LAII8K|4.0|Joesph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis deliver a highly entertaining roller coaster ride of fun, action, and mystery. I highly recommend you jump on board.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I had a level 15 and I updated the app to make it better. it lost all of my work now I am a level one. I am solo Mad right now.!!!
B009LRE040|5.0|A stunning ending to the greatest movie trilogy in the superhero film genre. Batman triumphs, as Bale, Hathaway, Gordon-Levitt, Hardy, Oldman, Caine, Cotillard, and Freeman deliver great performances. Epic indeed.
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|While I enjoyed the book, I was extremely disappointed that there were no modifications to this book's Kindle Edition. The pictures are so small and blurry that they can barely be seen. However, the pictures are better than the handwritten letters that are enclosed, which are impossible to read.<br /><br />I feel like I missed part of the magic of this book by not being able to view the pictures or read the letters. I am baffled that this book was not formatted correctly to be enjoyed on the Kindle. The description of the book itself states that it is a collection of photographs. So, I am left wondering why even bother offering this on the Kindle if the pictures and letters cannot be presented in this format.<br /><br />I was unable to fully immerse myself into the book as my mind constantly wondered if I had missed something important in the pictures or letters that I was unable to see and read.<br /><br />I hope that going forward, books that need to be specifically formatted to be presented on the Kindle will actually receive this formatting, or will not be offered on the Kindle.<br /><br />I know I sound like a broken record, but if you're going to read this book I advise against reading it on your Kindle.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Strap yourself in for a wild ride! Ryan Goesling is a true star that delivers a remarkable performance in this stunning movie.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good book in true Michael Connelly style! Initially I did not care for the kidnapping, because good guys have to \\"toe the line\\" between right and wrong. However, by the end the reader saw that it was a necessary evil.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Batman's gritty story is wonderfully created for everyone to enjoy. This is one you'll want to watch over and over again.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|I would recommend this.  Its short and easy to follow and i feel like i gwt a good workout after only five minutes.  As a mother of four sometimes thats all the time I have.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|These movies always leave me thinking there needs to be about 30 min more to the movie. Every movie just is a set up for the sequel. When will they ever get to kill the bad guys in charge?? Oh yea.... never!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I read The Lightning Thief with my granddaughter - we loved it and did not want to put it down - can't wait to read the rest of them
B00AA7O22U|4.0|If you want an over the top action filled movie this qualifies. So many guns and bad guy head blowing up it reminded me of Commando!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but sometimes it skips on my kindle but still its very fun and get this if you are looking for a game like temple run
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Slightly interesting plot helps to make you not so focused on the bad acting by the lead actor. He just doesn't portray a good mob hit-man from the future killing people from the even further future to me lol And I should know! HAHAHA
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Riveting read. Brilliantly written and powerfully moving.  The descriptions are vivid and the science most convincing.  I could not put it down!
B009KHCT94|4.0|Iron Sky tells the story of the Nazis that fled to the dark side of the moon after their defeat in 1945; they have reassembled their army with a deadly new battleship, and are preparing to invade Earth. Iron Sky is a great action/comedy/SciFi B-movie.<br /><br />The story in Iron Sky may be seen as absurd, but it's also original and innovative; at least, I personally haven't seen anything like it at this quality. The entire concept is ridiculous yet interesting, and the execution is great. The film is mostly a mixture of action and comedy. I enjoyed most of the comedy in this film, although it does miss a few times; the film mostly makes fun of U.S. politics, and occasionally others. I particularly enjoyed the hilarious jab at North Korea and the spoof of the iconic Hitler speech in \\"Downfall\\" (the bunker scene). The special effects were great, a lot better than I expected. The acting was also good for what it was aiming for. Aside from some unfunny jokes, another complaint was the ending; although it was okay, I felt it was a bit inconsistent and didn't really match the vibe of the rest of the film.<br /><br />Overall, I definitely enjoyed Iron Sky. As of 1/4/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, and I recommend a purchase for B-movie fans and a rental otherwise.<br /><br />Iron Sky has strong blood and violence.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Product works great on my computer and my tablet, I have several free kindle books as well. What would I do without my reader?
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Really enjoyed Settlers of Catan, can't wait to get some of the new expansions. Game play is constantly changing and challenging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game so fun and amazing :D I just cant stop playing it!!! its like I'm addicted to this game or something
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|i had just caught on to this show during the 3rd season & i got hooked instantly.  so i had to catch up on the first 2 seasons.
1936719010|2.0|I read a lot of books, this was a recommendation. I just wasn't impressed. I listen to it on Audiobook from Audible.com and was expecting a deep book on how to work better, but instead it was a short shallow re-hash of what you should already know.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I liked the mine carts and that you can save your person from dying. Getting coins is easier. (From my 8 year old)
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|If you really want a life that is effective and produces long after you are gone. If you read to learn how to be a better you, to know how to be a better human being.  If you are a Christian especially and want to find and search for the deeper meanings that God has put into your life and the world for you to do, your purpose, your heart beat. If you need to know how to survive the lowest points and enjoy the highest joys...<br /><br />Then read this book!!!  It will leave you grateful and more content in your situation, no matter how bad it is.  It will leave you with a deep and profound understanding of your life, your purpose and will re-focus your perspective.  It's a powerful book that will change your life and will effect your heart in deep ways.<br /><br />It will be required reading for anyone who works for me. I also have encouraged and given it to many people. This is a book that everyone should read regardless of where you are in your journey. Young or old, happy or miserable, rich or poor, guys and girls... everyone will get something deep from this.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|I like the movie and it is realistic.  Yes, something like this could happen in the real world of skiing.  About 3 skiers stranded on a ski lift and they close the ski area down.  They do not open until the next weekend.  One skier jumps to his death when he breaks a leg and stray hungry wolves attack him.  The only one to survive is the female.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Echen bought the book i say lime ley reed the book yo start the book los good but echen i finished i loved.I start looking. To see of the book has the esconde parte i Should no hay happens after the acholo.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I loved the complete set.  It is like watching totally different movies from the VHS set we had before.  The box is nice and fits all the DVD's in sleeve-like compartments (they are not individually cased).  Which I was fine with.  The price was right for me!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I was just a kid when this happened but I remember how anxious everyone was back then. That said, Affleck does a fine job presenting a film with excitement, intrigue, and a nice homage to the late 70s to the early 80s. Affleck plays Tony Mendes, a CIA op who comes up with a daring plan to save six Americans hiding in Tehran after their embassy is overrun by student radicals. The only way out is the airport which unfortunately is being guarded by military forces searching for the remaining embassy personnel.<br /><br />I know that many liberties were taken in the production of this film. These include but not limited to the part that the Canadian officials took, the dramatic airport escape, and the fact that several other embassies took some of the Americans. Still, we know that in Hollywood facts are often exaggerated for entertainment value so we shouldn't be too surprised.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This has been very useful.  I use it at least 5 days a week and would recommend it to anyone.

B00A757EFW|3.0|this is so stupid to try and play on the kindle.  i could not make any headway at all.  you would have to be very skilled at this game to get anywhere.
B0038P59A0|5.0|The movie is funny, entertaining, unpredictable, and Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are a perfect pair! The music sets the stage for a thrilling movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|works great I dont have any problems.  I like the big snooze button and the small dismiss button.  I don't leave kindle on just open it when alarm goes off.
0764169742|5.0|Having settled on graphite and colored pencils as preferred vehicles for artistic expression, I have bought many books and several sets of both colored and graphite pencils.  This is by far the best book I have found.  Whether or not you are convinced botanical art is your passion, this book can be instrumental in honing your drawing and color skills for any number of styles.  Form development, identifying underlying and layers of color patterns, and clear tone execution...this book covers it all.  I have found this book to be the most helpful art book in my library.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I wondered why it took so long to make the decision to get the hell out of there. It was difficult for me to relate to  the BDSM, but can appreciate that others may find it appealing. I found the all the characters, except Christian, interesting and believable. If you have a passing interest in BDSM with lots of sex it could be good for you. I love sex and good stories this, however did not do it for me.
1432794426|5.0|I was thrilled to pick up a book with no salacious entries about Michael Jackson. Finally a book that didn't rely on tabloid garbage and comments from people who didn't know this remarkable man. While much of the information I already knew it was still wonderful to have a book that made me laugh, cry, stomp my feet and just warm my heart. I would recommend the book just for the pure joy of it as it honors a man many of us love, admire and miss. RIP Michael
B00005B1W7|5.0|If you want a truly accurate portrayal of the times and attitudes, of the way WWII affected people and the decades to follow, you could scarcely do better. Having scanned down to my review you surely have encountered already much about the historical importance of addressing the holocaust on national television, and of the moving performances. That is true of course. But forty years later, there isn't anything of historical nature here I have not by now seen already enough times. What I like is the honest representation of people and situations.<br /><br />We see here imperfect people in an imperfect world. Good people forced into a harsh existence and the possible failure of their human qualities. Their struggle to maintain or regain this humanity and how it affects those around them.<br /><br />This is a very accurate portrayal of how people thought and how people acted and how the events of the war affected their complete and entire lives. To which, if there is anything else you want to understand about the fifties or especially the sixties whether it be civil rights or Vietnam, you can learn much by watching this mini-series.<br /><br />If I have one criticism it would be that it moves just a little slow. But it is very well cast with excellent performances and we can forgive a fault or two. I don't regret the time I spent and I expect you will not either.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this app is amazing get it! epic game makes you be more creative! would be fifty stars if it was possible!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love the options not just another alarm clock it has tons of sounds and it makes you do math just to hit snooze
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|This is my favorite of all three fairy dvd's with tinker bell.  The little girl is who made this dvd a hit for me.  she is sooooooo cute and she smiles so beautifully and pouts the same.  I love her.  I may need to buy the Lizzy doll.  Yes.  there is a doll.<br />Isn't there always.  I already have tinker bell.  lol

B009HNDCC4|5.0|Modern Family takes sitcoms to another level. The characters are great, very good acting, but it''s the writers that deserve the highest praise.  They are very witty and just keep that humor coming.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It worked very well for a while, but then it suddenly crashed. I keep trying to open it but it never works. It's terrible. Fun while it lasted.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book will show you why and how of success. And you may be surprised by Gladwell's insights into the matter. I would suggest that everybody read this book.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|you think temple run was good wait until you play this FREE game it is so much better because its not as limited it is sssoooo great !! (:
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Night Circus was a sensory delight which wrapped itself around an intriguing story that captivated me totally.  Many unanswered questions along the way sped me along to figure out what the untold challenge was really about.  Fascinating to the end!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|David Weber has become one of my favorite authors. I like his writing and I really like the people he writes about.  Besides that, the Honor Harrington series is the best of his work. (The Safehold series from a different publisher is also really good.)  Getting this for free is wonderful, because I felt it was worth every cent and more when I bought the book.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|&#34;Game of Thrones&#34; reminds me of stories of England around the time of the Crusades, but wherever Ned Stark and his friends and enemies hang their hats, it is not on the 3rd Rock from the Sun. Then add the element of the supernatural (ghosts and zombies?), and you surely have left Merry Old England. On the other hand, the characters are believable and relateable, as they face challenges both large and small, just like the reader.
B000002IG4|5.0|Bought it for my dad and he loves it. Of course I had to get 1 for me as well!!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I'm not a dedicated country music fan but I enjoy it. I've been watching the TV &#34;Nashville&#34; show and have been smitten with every song I hear. I googled hoping there was an CD and found it! I only wish there were more songs on it - can't wait to get next seasons!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I have been wanting to see this movies for years. It's not available to rent anywhere and I can't believe I finally found a place to purchase it. It's in good quality. It has some extra scenes no included in the film.<br /><br />I haven't looked at all the other features available on the DVD just yet.
1451695195|3.0|My husband is reading it, but not as interested in it as the person who recommended it to us.  They thought it was good.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I saw two mistakes while watching the first time, editing left in extra actors where they should not have been.<br />I watched the two sections again, and sure enough. So editing was not spot on.<br /><br />I thought it was a good remake otherwise.

B005OCFHHK|2.0|i rated this product with 2 stars because i thought it was a serious collection, and its just a simple box filled with the individual films collected from who knows where. All of them are new, but still, the sixth disc had this written: &#34;disc 1 movie&#34;.. which obviously meant it was deliberately taken from the individual movie set. im keeping it.  but in not satisfied.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My kids &amp; I love this game but since I've purchased Doofs story, the rest of the challenges won't load for us to play them. please fix this soon!! We want more levels!!
B001UW58YK|4.0|Very good quality picture, great sound and one of the best performers of all time. Theres nothing better than that.<br /><br />The case is not too fancy, but wiil keep your concert safe.
8866130923|5.0|This little red book is my new favorite work tool.  It conveniently fits in my purse and its hard cover seems like it will hold up against every day bumps and bruises.  Pages might be a bit thin as I can see my ink through the other side but this doesn't bother me.  I expect I will be quiet organized over the next year and I look forward to ordering the 2014 model.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great game but a little difficult to master.  I prefer freecell because of the difficulty of spider and freecell is more easily won.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great novel! Almost exactly like HBO's version but a lot more detail and background story. Ready for the next one!
0151013837|5.0|The book arrived in due course and in the condition represented.  I haven't read it yet.  I wanted the illustrated edition which depicts riveting scenes.  Perfectly happy.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Lots of new things and the graphics are better than the original.  My kids love playing it.  It is a great wasted of time :)
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend reading it to any kindle owner that likes these kinds of stories.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing. And this is the best season of the show so far. Can't wait to purchase the rest of the season when its available
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First a disclaimer.  I am almost 50 and a male.  I would ordinarily have little interest in the problems of young adults as they struggle through their first kiss/love.  I purchased the book because it was high on the best sellers list and I was tired of looking through the book lists.  I just wanted something to read.<br /><br />Congratulations Colleen Hoover, you can write directions for re-wiring my vacuum cleaner and I would consider buying it.  Yes it was that good.<br /><br />This is a journey of discovery and rediscovery.  The story unfolds at a nice pace and the author creates a connection with the characters along the way.  This book therefor satisfies both of my pet peeves.  It has a plot that is not apparent from the cover and it creates characters who are believable and take a journey towards discovering their true feelings.  No spoilers required.  You will want to know what happens next, and you will wait anxiously as the relationships unfold.<br /><br />Further the book was well written.  The author presents the book as if it were professionally edited and polished.  In the world of indy kindle this is becoming the exception rather than the rule and is greatly appreciated.  Thus the book earned the 5th star.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It s pretty hard but totally fun I highly recommend this game even if it was 2 99 I would still get it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It is exactly perfect just the way it is. I have been impressed with have many options there are, without compromising on looks or aesthetic layout. It is extremely integrated into other services and technologies, has a great backup function, and has been awesome.
B0000524E5|5.0|This movie was really good. I had not seen it and my wife insisted I was really missing out. :)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It feels like a piece of junk made in China, but practically speaking it has performed very well and I will not complain.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is so cool I love this amazing game I love the part Yul run so fast and then yuk get hit and I also love the mystery box wooooooooooooooooooooow sooooooooooooooooooooo amazing
B005K01VZS|4.0|I enjoyed reading it, getting a rabbi's perspective, but I don't think it made any great revelations or showed how two men bonded despite their different religions as I had thought it would from the summary.  The author seemed pretty indifferent to his own religion: said he was jewish, but wasn't really faithful to it, said his wife was Christian.  Sometimes he sounded like he was more Christian, but he really avoided giving his own religious thoughts.  What bothered me about the book is it seemed like the author was trying to be too melodramatic in the beginning.  He described a scene where a guy was hiding behind a trash can and praying for God's help.  From there, the book lacked action until it got back to that point.  It's like he wanted to give us some climax to work toward, but all he threw in was the climax--no real rising action.  I wasn't looking for that in a book like this anyway so the whole thing seemed misplaced.  I felt the same about how he talked of the rabbi asking him to perform his eulogy...like he tried to work it into some huge mystery that we'll solve by the end, but I either didn't feel that to be an imminent question or I didn't find there to be a great reveal of the answer.<br />Aside from those things, the book fews two (or three) perspectives pretty well and maintains interest.  It provides a couple laughs, a couple tears, and gives a good look at faithful people's lives.  I'm glad I read it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have seen the piano guy on youtube and now this makes it just as awesome to have it where ever i want on my ipod. thanks! This is Truly an Awesome CD! :)
1616550414|5.0|Now let me start off by saying I love this product. When I found out the book was coming to the U.S. I was so excited. I purchased this book purely for the collect-ability factor as I feel most people who buy this book have in mind as well. My issue comes from Amazon and their inability to package the book so it would not be tossed around inside of the packaging. While the book was not damaged to a degree that makes the book readable it instead has rolled hard cover corners and \\"dents\\" along the edges.<br /><br />To some this may seem petty, and I do admit to a certain degree it is. But when buying a product like this to collect more than to read it leaves me severely disappointed. I will also admit I DID NOT contact amazon about a return, by the time I pay return shipping and wait for a new book to arrive any real \\"value\\" disappears.
B0084AYLK8|4.0|The excellent use of language to desciribe the character and nteractions of the main characters was very polished and held my attention completely throughout. I liked the way the story unfolded, not a &#34;just so&#34; tale but one full of true to life human strenths and weakneses. The description of the enviorenment and tracking the history of Casterbridge and he normal day to day life of the enhabiants was interesting and made me feel almost that I was there. I would recommend &#34;The Mayor of Casterbridge&#34; to any lover of historical novels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of my favorite shows. I just started watching Downton Abbey about 3 weeks ago and was addicted right away.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|nice graphics and game play.  a little too linear for me though.  would prefer a bit more challenge.  note that to finish requires payment of 4.99...that is typical of g5 games.  the freebie is a demo / intro only.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just started using it.  So far so good! I have alwas liked playing with regular cards,<br />but this is very easy.  Love my new Kindle Fire HD
0743270754|5.0|I have always admired Abraham Lincoln and how he governed the United States during such a factious time in history.  This book is proof to his amazing leadership skills. The author painstakingly gives the read a detailed background of Lincoln's entire cabinet and how each one arrived to serve Lincoln.  While some may find this to be repetitive I thought it was great to be reminded of their background as each player had a rich history.<br /><br />For his rivals to become steadfastly loyal to Lincoln during his presidency is an a testament to his incredible negotiation and political genius.  Goodwin's book should serve as a textbook of how to govern in a true bipartisan fashion and how to win loyalty through smarts versus posturing as we see today with our highly functional Congress.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|This doesn't do what promises. When you use this in your kinect, it became crazy! I never will recomend this for anyone.
0553582038|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this book as not all of the usual cast of characters were in this. There were no POVs from Jon Snow or Dany Targaryen.  It was mostly focused on Cersei and her political machinations as Queen Regent and Arya being inducted into the Faceless Men.  Martin also introduces a brand new cast of characters of the Martells and the Sand Snakes.<br /><br />I felt this book was very complicated with the new addition of the Martells. More and more players are being introduced and it becoming hard to keep track of everyone.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the books despite missing Jon and Dany.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love, love, love it!!!! Best book series I've read in a long time!! Awesomely written!!! The suspense was awesome!! The only thing I wish there was more of was the ending- more details on how they got there and where it's going.  I'm still kinda \\"hungover\\" and nothing compares!! I actually have gotten irritated reading Sylvia Day because I've been comparing it- haha.  I recommend this trilogy to everyone! I read the entire set in less than a week( I do work and have kids so that's saying something!)!
0553381695|5.0|Martin picks up right away with the next chapter of the Game of Thrones with A Clash of Kings.  This novel begins the epic battle for the Iron Throne, who will ultimately win? With the death of Robert and the kingdom in disarray, Martin describes the motivation of each King or Queen trying to win. While the kings and queen battle for the ultimate prize they neglect the disturbances occurring at the Wall and beyond.<br /><br />My favorite character is Jon Snow, but Tyrion Lancaster is another fave. Despite his physical shortcomings, he uses his intelligence to comfortably situate himself in the den of lions with Cersei at the helm. I love the battles he engages in with her.  We also see the maturing of Dany and she begins of her goal of taking back the throne and restoring honor to the Targaryen name.<br /><br />Another fine novel in this intricate story!
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I must say Tegan and Sara are my favorite artists. I love how they evolved into a totally different sound from their first album, but still sounds like Tegan and Sara not sell outs. Each track caught my interset (like every album of theirs), I couldn't stop listening to it for days.
0553381709|5.0|The Storm of Swords picks up right away from A Clash of Kings. I read this fairly quickly and was HORRIFIED when I got to the Red Wedding. I know Martin doesn't keep his characters and will readily off them, but the Red Wedding just took the cake. I read he saved this chapter last to finish as it was going to be a crucial and emotionally draining to finish.<br /><br />I just could not believe it when I finished this book. I won't spoil it, but I can't wait to see this chapter come to life on HBO. Hopefully that's the episode Martin is writing.
B0038W0OIK|5.0|I had to buy 3 headsets which were all broken but when I bought this one it worked great and I love it!!!!!!
0439023521|4.0|I had to read this book given the incredible hype behind the movie and the series. I was fascinated by the post apocalyptic world Collins created.  The purpose of the hunger games, as primal and demented it was, the people were fascinated by it. I could not believe how violent the book was and that this was deemed a young adult book!<br /><br />Regardless, I loved the intelligence of Katniss as she figures her way with Peeta to win the games while maintaining their humanity. Great book!
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Calculator Pro Free is easy to use.<br />It has a big screen and buttons and<br />all the functions I need!
0553801473|4.0|I waited and waited for this book to finally come! Thankfully I have it on Kindle, because toting these thick paperbacks around is not fun. Well this book was worth the wait! Jon is the Lord Commander, Dany is Queen of Meeren and Tyrion embarks on another adventure with a long lost Targaryen in disguise. At least Cersei gets her just punishment by the Faith of the Seven.<br /><br />Reader, please read this book very carefully. There are a lot of details that is important to the plot of the character's backstory and who will ultimately sit on the Iron Throne.  Martin tells a lot of riddles and it takes some time to figure them out.  I have started to reread all of the books and have picked up details missed in the first run.<br /><br />Martin is a truly gifted writer with an incredible imagination. I will be sad when this series comes to an end, but it's been an incredible journey!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I havent had time in years,  to enjoy a great book. I couldn't get enough of Katniss and all that made this amazing trilogy
0553386794|5.0|I must confess, I decided to read this book after watching the first season of Game of Thorns on HBO. I finished this immense novel rather quickly. I was amazed how HBO brought this novel to life. This is how good this author is.  The show had dialogue from the book that was word for word, nothing was amended.  While the show was only 10 episodes long, I still thoroughly enjoyed the book and understanding the vast cast of characters of this series.  Martin is detailed and insane! He is not afraid to kill off main characters of the story.  I was SHOCKED with the deaths of Ned and Robert. But it was necessary to begin the Game of Thrones.<br /><br />I will be continuing the series to see who ultimately wins the Game of Thrones. I am rooting for Jon Snow to win!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Great new disc from Tegan and Sara. Great lyrics and catchy songs. One of their best discs in their catalog.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|glad to have it.......am reletively new to the kindle and it helps me immensely when i carry it to know what is going on....
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This product was great for my daughter she love it i still think the price should be a dollar or you need to have a special on the movies buy two get one free
B009GED3HS|5.0|Great show - the Robin Sparkles 4 episode was really, wait for it... Hilarious!  Paul Schafer?  And that Coulier dude - some real obscure jokes.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|The best app ever I love this app and you will too. Trust me I promise you . Have fun
B005NPCUC8|5.0|If you don't have this album in your collection, I don't want to know you. The remaster sounds fantastic and is an easy replacement for my much earlier version. No-brainer upgrade.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I feel that this is a great and wonderful app it keeps me entertained on the bus. But i dislike that it glitches at times and doesnt pick up when you touch it at times!
1451648537|5.0|Whether you're an Apple fanboy like myself, or are just intrigued by the man or the company, this is a great read. Isaacson gets deep into the man, his environment, and his experiences. I didn't feel like anything was being held back (except how Steve thought he cracked the TV), and everything feels like an honest assessment.<br /><br />For those in business, whether you're creating products or services, there are great insights and things you should be thinking about.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Excellent read.  Harry Bosch is one of my favorite literary characters.  Connelly keeps a great pace through the entire novel.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I'm not going to go into my normal rant about the Beatles in mono.  Let's just say that if you're a diehard fan, you have to have this.  The differences between the stereo and mono range from subtle to tremendous.  Sgt. Pepper's is a completely different album in mono IMHO.<br /><br />If you're anything but a diehard fan, you'll want to skip this. Otherwise, buy it now.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The whole series is addicting. I'm so happy Mary & Matthew FINALLY married! I look foward to seeing if Lady Edith will finally have her happy ending...
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I'm a Beatles fanatic and couldn't wait for this to come out. I've actually been waiting a long time because let's face it, the original CDs were great in the early 90's, but they don't hold up well compared to modern remastering.<br /><br />These CDs sound great. The highs are highs, and Paul's bass playing can actually be heard in the early albums.<br /><br />My only gripe would be that I wish the CDs were in jewel cases instead of cardboard digipacks.  The packaging is certainly nice, but I'd rather have more plastic.  But since I nearly immediately ripped them to iTunes (they weren't available in iTunes when I bought this), its not really an issue.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome and I can't wait for the next tour!!!<br />I love it and when my little brother looks at me playing subway surfers he say can I play!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I enjoyed playing temple run 2. I liked the new screens and i was addicted to it like numbrr 1
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|the game needs some work movements are messed as well with crafting. not worth it. I give a 2 star rating. so if u consider this game. just do minecraft instead. much smoother
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 is an okay game the objectives get me hooked. It can be awarding but sometimes you get tired of it like all games
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I highly recommended  it to anyone who wishes to read it. Please do. It is definitely an amazing book. One that I will be adding to my list of favorites.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book and book 2 started getting boring. Not enough story line. Wouldn't recommend these books unless somebody just wants to read about sex.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Some times I have some difficulties understanding them, they wisper quite offten! I enjoy the TV shows, very well done
0316789798|5.0|These drawing books are really fun for kids because they break down the drawing process into doable shapes that kids can make. I used them with my kids and now introducing them to my grandchildren.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Hard to get into the writing style at first,but spellbinding as the plot thickened.  Ending a shocker! Roccomended it to a fiend's book club
0316789720|5.0|I love these books-they are great for kids and adults. I used them with my kids and grandkids. They make it easy for kids to get the idea of shapes forming an image.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|Application worked well for Jan and Feb 2013. Starting with input for 12 Mar, no matter what I entered,it would not show.  SINCE I hit create I assumed it should be somewhere.  I started scrolling and found the items were all entered on 31 Dec 2013. I had assumed with all of my computer experience there would not be a problem.  MANY hours wasted.  Suggest finding another program.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I purchased this for my phone, the Droid Razr because I was not getting the battery life I was hoping for. I received the battery, and it immediately worked great! Unfortunately, it was a little bit banged up from shipping. I emailed them, and within 2 days they were shipping me out another battery, and emailed me a prepaid shipping label for my return. There aren't enough good things to say about this company, and this product. It is the fastest charger I have, has a huge battery within it (4x a standard battery), and it holds it's charge for a LONG time if you don't use it. My only two gripes are 1- that the chord it came with was very easy to lose, which I did within the first week of having it. It was no big deal though because it charges via a standard micro-usb chord; 2- It takes a long time to charge all the way up. That is expected however because it is a big battery. Imagine charging your phone 4x- that is how long it takes. All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone who needs something like this.
0553801473|4.0|While I do understand the disappointment of many readers of ADWD, I can't help but disagree.  Perhaps this is because I didn't start reading the novels in the 1990s and read them all straight through in a row.  I also know that there will be 7 books in the series, which made me not expect a complete resolution by the end of this book.  What I think Feast and Dance do accomplish, is to broaden the spectrum of the fantasy world in which all of these events are occurring, introduce new characters, some of which I liked, some of which I found dull, but could tell that in the greater context they would eventually become important.  I am not going to put in any spoilers, because I read one idiots review of this book that ruined a major event for me, but, I can say that it has plenty of action as well as prophecy.  I can also say it has plenty of slow moving chapters as well.  Not every chapter in the books can be exciting and action packed when you are portraying such a vast viewpoint of a completely different world from the eyes of many.  I think the biggest problem people have with Feast and Dance is that they are not nearly as Stark-centralized narratives.  While the Starks were the first family of honor and the protagonists that we were introduced to, a complex story of this size would be boring if it only revolved around them.  That is what makes A Song of Ice and Fire unique.  The good guys don't always win.  It makes fantasy more realistic.  I probably agree with some that certain charatcers did not need POV chapters, their stories could have been told through other's POVs.  But it is what it is.  and the 4th and 5th books of the series are setting up what will hopefully be a fantastic finish in the 6th and 7th as we continue to explore this wonderful world that Martin has created.  That being said, if you are very emotionally attached to the Starks and don't find other characters as interesting, it is pretty much OK to stop at Book 3.  You won't be disappointed, and HBO will show you their version of the rest of the story anyway.  So if Feast and a Dan are daunting, skip them.  But bashing them is irrational as they are a logical progression of the story addressing the world outside of Westeros, Winterfell and Kings Landing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You need to get it no matter what it cost super fun!!!!!! (: If you build this is for you
B009D5VNLS|4.0|Downloaded the movie via amazon instant video and had access to it on iPhone, iPad, roku, blu ray and Mac in about 2 minutes we started watching. Great movie, lots of comedy. But it does have a few moments that were too scary for our 4 year old daughter.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have had so much playing this with my kids, its a great game to keep kids creative and thinking.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|How can anyone take the perfect combination of history and zombies and have it be dull?  After painfully slogging my way thru 1/3 of the book I just ran up the white flag.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|this is so important for everyone to watch. I am not a vegetarian and am raised by farmers but this is so important to watch what the government is doing to our food. It is horrendous and we need to stand to gether and stop this.
B000660UN0|5.0|Truly Outstanding Music and thru his own interpretations. Blues is about a feeling,combined with sadness and joy. Experiences of life up and down. This a excellent live session. Blues Prof. Needs to stay off whatever he is taking. I am Ordering this combo DVD and CD for myself.
B004N8CP8K|1.0|I set this up according to instructions, but it would never connect to my computer.<br />I was successful using another app called Mocha VNC Lite.
0765325950|5.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal.  After two decades following this epic series to have a conclusion of this quality is a surprising boon.  If by chance you have been awaiting the end to read this epic.  Now is the time!!!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I can honestly say I am actively trying to burn this digital CD out. (Not like its possible) But I love the songs. They are actually very versatile in their range. Not the same sound with each song, I have played this CD so many time that one day I can walk away from it and still sing the lyrics years later. Can't wait to see what else they come out with/
B000UNYJV8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies that I saw on TV late at night. As always amazon had it! It tells the story of a young boy who joins a group of skinheads. The split from Trojan (Traditional Skins) to Rascist/Far Right Skins is shown here with Combo. It does very good to show the Skin Culture in a movie (the director was a Skin in his youth and it's pretty autobiographical). It is a great coming of age tale, a great Skin movie, it  also examines how hatred can spread through manipulative people and how through reason good will rise in the end. Be warned this movie is quite an emotional experience and the ending is cathartic.<br /><br />All the music is great (Toots and The Maytals, Percy Sledge, The Specials, U.K. Subs, the Piano themes by  Ludovico Einaudi, Et cetera) in short  it's all good.<br /><br /> As for extras there is an essay on skins, a making of feature, and the deleted scenes (including the alternative ending)<br /><br /> 10/10 movie I would highly recommend it to those who keep the spirit of '69 Alive  and those who aren't skins at all. It's just a great movie that has a powerful message, it's pretty universal and not just about a subcultute that is very misunderstood.
B000053VAF|4.0|So far I have heard nothing but nice things said about it. The shipping and handling was excellent. It arrived earlier than expected and the person I got it for was very happy. He had been trying to locate this movie for awhile.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|A little zany but in  a good way. We enjopyed for a check your brain at the door kinda moovie. Depp of course was great.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Can't wait to get the third season and see how the characters and their lives progress. This series has all my attention.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Jack Reacher is not the most exciting character, and the details that the author uses occasionally in the story about the travel seem disconnected. I feel like some things are in the book to make it longer, like the action events take to long to actually occur, so I just skim over those.<br /> The story line does hold my interest. I am eager to find the reason for the killings, so I keep reading.<br />I would like to  have seen more development of  the Roscoe character.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game some times the instructions are a bit abstract but overall great game<br />good for killing time and helps keep things from getting boring
B006LSZECO|5.0|Page after page of suspense and intrigue.  Characters and plot are well developed and one feels as if he is reading a true story instead of fiction.  The surprise ending is a stinger..
B0009K7ESW|5.0|Breath taking music blended with visual compositions. Mesmerizing. I saw this on the BBC many years ago and am thrilled I can watch it over and over again now.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My 7 year old loves this game.  A little more difficult than TR1 because it just isn't about running anymore.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  She captured with her story from the very beginning.  The emotions run high with this book.  What a brave, strong girl!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My 9 year old loves the entire WK series.  This one is no different.  Can't miss if your kids already enjoy the series.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was crazy good from beginning to end.  As told through the eyes of a child yet completely understandable by any adult.  I will not forget this book.
630463949X|5.0|We had this on VHS....wanted it on dvd.  Great concert.  Lots of history between Lindsay and Stevie!!!!  A couple of the songs tell the story.  Great music!!!
B003V5CFV8|4.0|It made me laugh like I haven't laughed in a long time. I loved the music!  I grew up on that kind of music in Ky.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I had bought the CD for the song The Story, but ended up liking other songs on here as well.
B00957T6X6|4.0|I did enjoy this very long series. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the ending. It seemed as though Martin just decided to say, &#34;The End.&#34; Nearly all of my favorite characters were killed which left decidedly disappointed. I won't be rereading this which is what I usually do with books that call me back. These just sailed off into the sunset--without me.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved this dark yet delightful tale...so glad I picked it up!<br />I recommend this book and that is all yep
1451695195|4.0|well written and intersting and believeable . I hope to see a follow up book after Eben has more time to reflrct on his experience
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|They keep cranking out great albums and music!  I will always buy anything they put out as they are so talented.
0525423656|4.0|Book two is structured differently than book one. Book one was set up completely from Cassia's perspective, but book two follows Cassia's and Ky's perspectives independently. Ky has been living in the out skirts of the Society, which is a death sentence for anyone who lives there. They are decoys established by Society to control the unseen enemy, but they all know they were actually sent there because society wants to exterminate all aberrations. Time is running short, and if Ky wants to get to Cassia he needs to escape. One day an air ship carries him and several others to a village near the Carving, a massive canyon where he used to live. This is his moment and with the aid of his friends Vick and Eli, they are able to make it to the safety of the canyon as the enemy attacks. Together they trudge through the canyon, but they learn they are not alone. There is someone else there, and their lives are still very much in danger.<br /><br />Cassia is determined to find Ky. With the aid of her parents she is placed at the outermost border of Society, but she only has a limited amount of time before she will be sent back to live with her parents. She must find a way to get past the borders if she is to find Ky. Through a serendipitous opportunity, Cassia is able to sneak herself onto an air ship that is leaving for the outer most regions. Once at the village she learns where Ky had gone to and she and Indie are lead to the spot in the Carving by a boy from the camp. There she and Indie begin the long hike through the cavern. As they venture in to the unknown Cassia learns that the blue pill that was supposed to provide nutrition is actually poison meant to kill, they run across a group of people whose bodies are burned and chard by who they can only assume is the Society, and Cassia begins to doubt if she can trust Indie. There is something about her that doesn't seem quite right.<br /><br />After Cassia and Ky reunite they must decide what to do. They go back to the Carving to make plans and meet Hunter, a farmer left behind because of his sick daughter. He reveals secrets within the Carving that Society has tried to hide from the world. It is a secret storage area of tissue samples of those once living in the Society, but it is unclear as to why Society would hide them there. Hunter also reveals that there is in fact a rebellion group called the Rising. The news generates a gamut of reactions amongst the small group. Should they go in search for the Rising or create their own world apart from Society and the Rising? What ever their decision it could cost Cassia and Ky their entire relationship. This is an exciting sequel to Matched and it fosters so many questions that you will be left wanting to read what happens next. Revelations are coming out left and right about the true intentions of the Sociey, but along with these new realizations more questions come as well. What a great read.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Love it and will definitely buy Part 2!!!! Thick paper cover that folds out into a 1/2 of a house... check it out! So glad this band released a new album!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read Dark Places, the author's second book first. She is a great writer and her stories really suck you in. I'm reading Gone Girl next and I know it's supposed to be awesome. Can't wait.
B00B2EWNWG|2.0|Don't buy, wait till you can rent it. Not worth the e tea money and probably won't watch it again.
1475143389|5.0|Mr. Mike Matthews has done a wonderful job presenting valuable information in this book. A lot of the  information in the book was not new to me, but he organized it and presented it in a way that made it much easier to use correctly. I was especially impressed with the diet section of his book. Very thorough. Mike Matthews really cares how people do. He has contacted since buying the book and we've had cool conversations about working out. I'm now finishing up Week 3 of his workout plan. Really enjoying the improvements! If you want to get fit (i.e. ripped, sexy and/or healthy) I would absolutely recommend trying this plan.
B0093H8HXS|4.0|The CPU in question is no gamers delight.Then again,on the other hand it's no slouch either for most tasks.I would recommend it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I loved Gone Girl...so I looked for more Gillian Flynn.  This book was awesome!  It is a crime/mystery/horror all in one.  It will keep you guessing and shocked until the last page!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I just thought it would be more action oriented.  First few minutes were fine but then it devolved into how bad your relationships can be if you drink to excess.  I thought I had lessons in that many years ago.  Wasn't looking for another one.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Kept you interested from the very beginning, which is a Clancy trait! May have to read again in the future!
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Like most folks, I have seen one or two of the movies, however not the entire set.  Once it was advertised as a Blu-Ray collection, I had to bite.  Quality is good and the chemistry between the actors is lightening.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Having been a long time fan of Clint Eastwood and a life long baseball fan, I simply could not help myself. I was a little concerned that Clint Eastwood could not deliver a great baseball movie. Boy was I wrong<br /><br />Clint is a scout for the Atlanta Braves and is the best in baseball. His problem is, he is losing his vision and age appears to have caught up with him.<br /><br />Amy Adams stars with Clint in this movie and plays his estranged daughter. He is in the process of being phased out by computers and hot shot scouts who really know little about baseball except how to find statistics on a computer. Clint does a brilliant job and Amy Adams is well worth watching. Its another baseball movie that is not really about baseball. Eastwood may be in his 80s now but he still knows how to make a great movie. Well worth watching
1451696191|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book when I was high school age.  It is written in letter format, which is unique and enticing.  However, this book should come with a trigger warning.  It addresses depression and suicide, and that isn't necessarily a topic everyone should read about.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|recipient loved it.  I'm told it is a wonderful series with great acting and an addictive plot line.  works for me.

B002VECM6S|5.0|Excellent story and a feel good movie.  Suitable for the entire family.  It's a classic in the &#34;special&#34; genre.  buy it.
1594744769|5.0|Bought for teenage daughter she loved the book.<br />Great book if you like weird things and weird people.<br />Wonder if author writes more books?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this type of game and I really loved this one! It was fun doing the puzzles!<br />Hurry up wit a sequel!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I heard about this series on the Today show and once I saw the begining of the series I was hooked.<br />cant wait untill the next series comes out
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game and am super addicted to it.  It is one of those games that you have to wait for lives though. LOVE IT&#62;
B007IQX1G4|1.0|This movie lacked a plot. The protagonist did not learn anything nor did she over come anything. She was a jerk the entire movie. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS MOVIE.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book so much! Out of all of Nicholas Sparks books this one was probably my favorite.  It's so different from his other books and has kind of a Sleeping with the Enemy vibe to it.  If you like Nicholas Sparks or even if you don't I would defiantly give this book a try!
B006VRZ5YM|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was funny and witty. I was a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I bought this product online for $12.99 and it came in perfect condition! Love this show and glad I could get it for cheap!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book will appeal to all age groups and personalities. Not one to generally go for fantasy, I none the less got absorbed in this tale. Looking forward now to seeing how it is portrayed on film.<br /><br />NO
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I can use it for algebra....to help my niece with her math tips for restaurant and almost any other thing yo could think of
B009KS4XRO|1.0|this game had many options but do not count on keeping the points you &quot;win&quot;. disappointing &amp; frustrating ...points disappear
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like temple run2  to be honest its challenging but fun I have to give this a 5 RATING!.it's not that hard ever since I got temple run2  I'd survive longer for some reason
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show ever - need I say more?  Ok they are making me type more words or I can't publish this reveiew so here goes - more words. LOL  BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!
B005CMSDLE|5.0|Eric Bana is great in this movie. It's very different, hardcore, interesting and suspenseful. It's a movie that I would buy as a gift for someone.
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|To everyone out there purchasing these DVD&#34;s.  Do you know that you're being cheated and ripped off?  These DVD's, all of them, all 3 seasons, have been EDITED for content.  All these DVD's are missing KEY SCENES from each episode.  I want to know why?  I've PURCHASED these DVD's and I'm entitled to receive them and veiw them in their entirety!  For example, season 3, episode 5.  For those of you who already have the season 3 DVD's watch episode 5 - then re-watch episode 5 on TV if you have Exfinity On Demand.  Do you see how many wonderful, decent and pertinent scenes are missing?  I love Downton Abbey!  I purchased the series on DVD so that I could own and watch and re-watch something wonderful.  I didn't get what I paid for - a series that is UNCUT and UNEDITED.  I hope I'm not the only person who is as angry and disappointed as I am.  Maybe if more people voiced their outrage we might get either an answer, an apology, a replacemment, something, anything.
030746363X|5.0|I bought this book for the slow carb diet info. The first week I lost 4 pounds! Would definitely recommend this book.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great series with a lot of twists.  We started watching season 3 and had to also purchase seasons 1 and 2.  I hope it runs for years.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Nevertheless, this film had perfect timing in the tense scenes, and the editing/ filming of it makes it feel like a documentary. At first I wondered why bring up the back story of Tony Mendez' life? But in one of the last scenes it adds warmth to the character. It humanizes what we so often think are warriors without empathy. I was consumed with every decision the character was having to face. I loved it, kinda felt disconnected in the beginning but I think because so many action films are filled with speed and \\"Hollywood\\" I was taken back but that needed to be done so that many Americans (I include myself) could understand the facts of this historical event...I had no idea about. Brava!
B001LF3YQK|3.0|Wipes Case with unusual and nice.Handpicked too good to use, I love it ..<br />Wear on the stroller even think
B000SEI230|3.0|I recently finished reading a walk to remember but didn't enjoy it nearly as much as his other books.  I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it was written from the man's point of view for a change, but it just didn't capture my attention and desire to keep reading as his other books did.
1616550414|5.0|Arrived on time and was just as described. Awesome book with a lot of exclusive content. Would definitely recommend to any Zelda series fan.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|We love Elementary! What a surprise to find a new show that is so good. Sometimes the plot has some slightly distasteful aspects, but they evaporate as the episode moves on.<br />Streaming Elementary is so nice with no commercials. We are older than the commercials target age group, so many commercials do not apply to us.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|what a great story, the pilot performs a miracle in the sky and all the big wigs want to slaughter instead of being happy that he saves everyone but 6. What's wrong with this picture.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|She has a unique voice and really knows how to use it. I bought it knowing full well the types of songs she sings and her voice. She doesn't disappoint at all with her use of the piano and great lyrics she sings. This is for anyone who just wants to enjoy music.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Fantastic! Awesome sequel and I can't wait for the next one. One of the best literary protagonists I have read in a while.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Interestingly and entertaining.  Not sure I loved it but I did like it.  It was quite a story line to think up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think the New temple run is just awesome, I love it ! So intriguing and addicting i really loved it ! I will be playing this game for a long while
B00170I7GG|5.0|Just like the movie plot that features Bill Murray as a weatherman that relives Groundhog Day over and over, I've seen this movie several times over the years and never get tired of it!  If you like Bill -- I highly recommend this film.  It's one of my favorites!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's so awesome cause it is funny very funny hope he makes another one. Really good book Jeff Kinney :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really nice improvements over the last one and I enjoyed that.  This new one has more eye candy, greater difficulty, and just more fun.  Plus the greatest piece of all...IT`S FREE!!!
0316056871|5.0|I loved this. I laughed out loud several times. I even got a little misty. I didn't want it to end.
0321344758|3.0|Overview<br /><br />Steve Krug's first book - Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability - was an enjoyable read. The value of the book depends largely on experience and expectations of the reader. On the back cover, the book states that it's for Web Design/Web Development and the User Level of Beginning-Advanced. Hence, coming in as a QA engineer/manager, I didn't know if my expectations were going to be met. While the book was an enjoyable read, I only found a couple of sections that I could apply immediately to my work.<br /><br />Usability Testing<br /><br />Steve does a great job throughout the book of including images and analogies which help pull everything together - indeed, web design in many cases is no different than any other kind of design. All design should be clever enough to complete the task well, but simple enough that the task should be easily accomplished by anyone.<br /><br />Chapter 9 had the greatest impact on me as a QA manager. Chapter 9 is all about usability testing. Steve said a few interesting things about usability. Among my favorites was on pg. 132: \\"...the main thing (usability testing) ends up doing is revealing that the things they were arguing about aren't all that important. People often test to decide which color drapes are best, only to learn that they forgot to put windows in the room. For instance, they might discover that it doesn't make much difference whether you go with the horizontal navigation bar or the vertical menus if nobody understands the value proposition of your site. Sadly, this is how much usability testing gets done: too little, too late, and for all the wrong reasons.\\"<br /><br />Read more at - [...]
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I was looking forward to getting this DVD set and thought oh, it'll be full of extras, it will be over the top, blah blah blah, yay. Well, for the steller price I got it at I was so excited to learn it's just the bare minimum. 3 movies, an &#34;extras&#34; book and that's it. The box set is setup very nice but I'm so happy that the set is just the movies and not all the fireworks and extras. I love a clean cut design and presentation and this set is just that. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good Dark Knight Trilogy for their DVD collection.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I loved this app but I reset my kindle fire &amp; it's no longer compatible .. should I update it out what cause it doesn't work ?
1439102813|5.0|A fascinating glimpse of Alzheimers from the inside out.  Brought up many questions ie. what would you do.... A sad but lovely story.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Awesome game that doesn't require you to be there all the time. Way better than farmville. I mean come on it's dragons!
B004HD61KE|4.0|If you like Vince Flynn and Lee Child, be sure to check out James Rollins, particularly the Sigma Force series.  Great read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Much improvement over the first one in terms of everything. Can't get a better free game. Worth your time to play.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I had a lot of fun playing this game, although it isn't the full game you do have to purchase it about a quarter to half way through. Graphics were great and storyline was plausible...I might even consider playing it again on a harder mode! Thanks so much!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Not happy about having to lose every thing to upgrade!  Hours of entertainment. Just wish we could choose different levels or different places.
1594487154|5.0|Great book by an amazing author.  I never thought I'd even remotely be interested in reading a book about sales, but after reading his other works, I figured I'd give it a shot.  He definitely sold me on the idea that we're all in sales, and that we can all benefit from applying some of these principles.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the book is that I'll have to read it again, so that I can more carefully review all of the exercises to really make these things work for me :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love that you can go back and see previous calculations when multiple calculations are made and you can go back and fix a calculation if you make a mistake.
B008NEMN0K|3.0|The 3D really isn't that much different from the regular movie. I expected more 3D action than what was actually there
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|Borrowed this book from the local library on my kindle.  Was not what I was expecting.  Was interesting enough to keep me reading but not interested enough to get the next book in the series.  Lots of mythological references.  Interesting premise..
B007JVJ3C4|2.0|Not as good as the first one, even in 3D. It is O.K., Liked the first one better, more action
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Ever since her story first hit the news I've wanted to read her story it is such a great story of survival she is a true hero
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for Book 6 to come out so I can fin out what happens next. I read book 1 to 5 back to back and loved every second!
0525457585|4.0|Nice book about fantasy life and worlds that draws you in. A good companion to read before seeing the film as that's how the film got made.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game and its free ...You cant go wrong with that..No laying and the graphics are top notch.All I can say is you cant go wrong with this one.Thanks again.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|The &#34;best&#34; part of this film was the trailers which were free on TV. Way to long and never any noticeable attempt to draw in the viewer.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a well-written novel... also strange and disturbing. This is the kind of book that is hard to put down. HIghly recommended!
B0090SI4HO|4.0|Arnold plays a small town sheriff after leaving an exciting life in the special forces, the LAPD, and as a cyborg. We get to meet the various characters in the town when suddenly a farmer is killed and his land is being prepared... Meanwhile...<br /><br />In LA, a high level cartel prisoner is being transported, a man who also drives race cars. Before Arnold can say, \\"I know what's coming\\" we know what's coming too minus a few details.<br /><br />Not since \\"Rocky V\\" has there been generated so much excitement about a comeback. Arnold plays Arnold, reminding me more of the \\"Ben Richards\\" Arnold. Perhaps it is because of his use of the word \\"negative.\\" The characters and the over the top action make the film worth watching. Unfortunately the characters fell a little short on development and the action didn't go well with the script. The town confrontation scene was haphazardly done. Forest Whitaker plays an FBI man who should have been better developed and could have added some fun to the script. On the plus side, the script was \\"tight.\\" It didn't give you any wasted scenes which didn't tie in later to the film. I like that aspect of writing.<br /><br />The day is saved by a gun enthusiast who have fallen out of grace for the moment. A worth while edition to an Arnold collection.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs (some with an accent). No sex or nudity.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The subway suffers app is great it is in my top ten games on my tablet.I really like the world tour it is so fun when you play in different States or countries.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|The whole family wants a turn with this Piano Master. We see you can beat each other scores. It was a good choice from the free apps. Thanks
B00683JK9K|5.0|Have spent hours on this - really like it and love the music that goes with it!!!  It was good enough to also be loaded on my DH's Kindle Fire HD too!!!!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I am enjoying reading this book. I am only half way though the book. The book keeps me interested in the story line. Quite a page turner!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I always wanted a horse but i'm intimidated by them. This game is very entertaining. I'm also happy it was free.
B000OLRH10|5.0|ONE OF MY TOP TEN FAVORITE FILMS!<br /><br />THE DATA IS ACCURATE AS FAR AS THE 'BLOOD DIAMOND TRADE'.<br /><br />DICAPRIOS'S AND HOUNSUS PERFORMANCE ARE COMPLETELY SPOT ON.<br /><br />AN EXILERATING ACTION PACKED FILMED THAT SHOWS EVEN THE MOST HARDED SOULS ....CAN BE CHANGED.
B005KIR21M|5.0|Got it for my Daughter for her birthday and she plays with it almost everyday. I got it to go with the zoo and she loves it!!!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|This is amazing.  I bought it and cut 36 wine bottles and then told my son to save his and took it to his place and cut another 24.  Easy to use and now I have lots of candles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a very addictive game, once u start playing it's hard to put the game down. Great graphics...Cool new obstacles....Great game altogether.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Such a unique story line. onto Dont know how anyone could come up with it. the On to the sequel! I just hope it's as good as the first.
B006UG909U|3.0|I bought this because I like to support the bands that were great in my day and even though this release is better than the garbage that they try to pass off for rock nowadays, I don't listen to it much other than two tracks.
B0086DBE62|3.0|With one watch was enough.  I think it was in the middle of stuff for kids and stuff for adults.  I love Julia, but the rest was just fine.
B00023B1AS|5.0|These are vintage 80's videos and show the Little Ol Band from Texas at its funnest. The chciks aren't quite as hot as I remembered them but the music still rocks.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I have not read such a good book in a very long time. Not only does the story ring true to the original fairy tale, it takes a whole new spin, and adds twists to that, making it a breath-taking page turner that you can not put down. I foun myself staying up late, resisting going to work, or moving on with my daily duties in favor of reading more of this compelling tale. I am a little disappointed to see that Scarlet is not directly picking up where Cinder left off, but with how compelling a read Cinder was, I can only expect more goodness. A must read for all children, and children at heart.
B005ELZKWS|3.0|Everything is pretty listenable if you like the first Chickenfoot relase but nothing that's gonna go the distance. I loved Sammy's original solo stuff the best and his tuff with VH second best but his Chickenfoot stuff is still better than 99% of all the other stuff that so-called &#34;rock&#34; bands are putting out today.
0399242864|5.0|One of our favorite books! I also love that it's a board book and very durable :) I like most other Oliver Jeffers books as well.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Kelly Clarkson Greatest Hits - Chapter 1:<br />Track-by-track Review:<br />*Please note that I am a new Kelly Clarkson fan so it will be from that perspective*<br />1.

Never Again: 10/10<br />8. Already Gone: 10/10<br />9. Mr. Know It All: 10/10: Really good.<br />10. Breakaway: 8/10: Didn't grow on me as much as the others.<br />11. Don't You Wanna Stay (with Jason Aldean): 7/10: My least favorite. I don't really like Jason Aldean. I think this song should have been replaced by  either \\"Dark Side\\" or \\"I Do Not Hook Up\\".<br />12. Walk Away: 9/10<br />13. Catch My Breath: 10/10: My favorite song in the album!<br />14.

Behind These Hazel Eyes<br /><br />AVERAGE: 9.4/10 = A<br />Just because it's an A and not an A+ doesn't make this at all a skipper! This is a really good album!<br />However, personally, I think either \\"I Do Not Hook Up\\" and \\"Dark Side\\" were bigger hits than some songs on this album, based on my research, so they should have been on here!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Another game that passes time very quickly when you play.  I definitely got hooked and can't seem to stop playing!!
B009EP3DJM|5.0|2 years after her album Cannibal, Ke$ha releases her newest album, \\"Warrior\\". Both Animal and Cannibal were amazing (to me), but this is even better! One big noticeable differences will be that, while she has a few mainstream, quite a few of these songs are not at all mainstream music.<br />Track-by-Track rating!:<br />1. Warrior: 10/10: Her starting song is amazing and makes you want to listen more!<br />2. Die Young: 10/10: Her hit song off of this album is very good, but not as good as many of the others.<br />3. C'mon: 11/10: I'm sorry for the above-10 rating, but I just love this song. I don't even know how to explain. It just works.<br />4. Thinking of You: 10/10<br />5. Crazy Kids: 10/10<br />Now this is were Ke$ha gets off of the stream known as main!<br />6. Wherever You Are: 10/10<br />7. Dirty Love, feat. Iggy Pop: 7/10: I cannot STAND Iggy Pop.<br />8. Wonderland: 10/10: Probably her best non-mainstream song ever.<br />9. Only Wanna Dance With You: 9.5/10<br />Back to mainstream:<br />10. Supernatural: 10/10<br />11. All That Matters (The Beautiful Life): 10/10<br />Off the stream:<br />12. Love Into The Light: 9/10: Starts really good, but gets a little boring at the end.<br /><br />Don't miss these tracks especially!<br />(Top 5):<br />5. Crazy Kids<br />4. Wherever You Are<br />3. Wonderland<br />2. Thinking of You<br />And, her best song ever...........<br />*Drum-roll*<br />1. C'mon! I'm not joking that right now I am on my 25th listen on iTunes. I go on iTunes just to listen to this. It's my favorite song EVER!<br /><br />So... GET THIS ALBUM!!!! It's VERY good.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Mercy mercy this is a some movie I work with addicts.....this is a life lesson.  A real eye opener.  If he does not get an Oscar for this.....seriously....great acting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it's totally fun and adicting at the same time in a good way .Evan my five year old brother,William is playing it and it is also his favorite game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put the book down, I read it in one day. Really great read and well worth checking out. :)
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|this movie was cute , i thought it would be better but it is a kids movie.  i don't think it was worth the rental fee though, i would wait until i was free
B002JODPSO|5.0|This is my favorite Die Hard movie with all the action!  I love Timothy Olyphant in this one, great acting!
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This is one of the best boarding DVD/blue-rays I have seen.  It has amazing HD and the soundtrack is on point. You will definitely enjoy this.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Pretty fantastic story line.  Not anywhere near as believable as his earlier works.  Moves along quickly as all Grisham's do.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Hi I'm Michael Woodyshek. This was a great story. I wish you made more books like this. By the way, you're frickin awesome.<br />-Michael Woodyshek
044654759X|4.0|I have not read a book by Nicholas Sparks in awhile, sadly probably a few years and I am not sure why. I used to love to read his books and this book made me remember why.<br />Safe Haven is one of those books that you read just to relax. I know most people are going to be like you read any book to relax but that isn't true. When you read say a true crime book for example (or any non fiction for that matter) it will take you more time to read it and more paying attention to the book because it is more about facts and real life things. This is just a very easy read that you can curl up on the couch with or sit on the beach and get through rather quickly. There are no major plot points that will shock you aside from maybe one but I will get to that in a moment.<br />As a general rule I am not a huge fan of romance but once in awhile I find one I enjoy and I have yet to read a Nicholas Sparks book that I didn't like. Romance movies even usually annoy me because they are mostly all the same. While this was predictable Sparks writing style always makes me fall in love with his books.<br />A good addition to his books tho and if you are a fan I would recommend reading it.<br />*SPOILER*So the ending.. Katie has a friend throughout the book named Jo, well as it turns out that is really Alex's late wife and Katie has been seeing her and she wasn't really there. I know this is supposed to be all sweet and go along with the letter that Alex's late wife writes to the woman Alex falls in love with later on her death bed but for me it was not needed. The ending for me anyway was just tied to nicely and I felt as if Alex giving her the letter in the end would have been enough without the ghost, vision or whatever you want to call it.
0988262592|5.0|Good books captivate you. They take sole ownership of your attention and do not let go until they are done with you.<br /><br />Better books do all that and only begrudgingly let you think about other minor things (such as \\"when was the last time you ate?\\"; \\"did you really miss a phone call an hour ago?\\") once they're done with you.<br /><br />Best books make you think about the lessons they imparted for a long time after they decided you've heard enough from them. They leave you sated, yet thirst for more knowledge. The knowledge that you just need to attain. They don't tell you how to do things, they teach you how to think. They show you where to go to find more answers - and even more questions.<br /><br />The Phoenix Project is definitely one of the best books you'll have the privilege of reading. The story will make you reminisce, cringe, it will find you wanting to tell the main proponents off, it will have you re-run the old mistakes you've seen or done in the past and think about how you could've fixed that train-wreck IT project before it became a spectator sport.<br /><br />The proposals and solutions in the book seem deceptively simple until you embark on the journey to implementation. Then the realisation slowly creeps in that in order to mimic what the book proposes you need to reach out to others. You also need to dig deeper, follow the recommendations that the book has in abundance.<br /><br />If there's only one book on business, organisational structure, and making things done that you plan to read this decade, make it this one.

B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|When you think of where some of rock's greatest and most memorable albums were recorded, chances are that Sound City is not what you have in mind.<br /><br />Located in a run down neighborhood in Van Nuys California, Sound City's dilapidated appearance looks better suited to the production of meth, not music.<br /><br />This is the story that Foo Fighter's front-man and first-time director, Dave Grohl, sets out to tell about this unlikely rock landmark that changed the face - and more specifically, the sound - of music.<br /><br />And Grohl would know, as Sound City is where Nirvana recorded their seminal album, \\"Nevermind,\\" before it exploded onto the scene and transformed the rock landscape forever.<br /><br />** \\"This Place is a Dump.\\" **<br /><br />Sound City opened its doors in 1969 to an inauspicious beginning. It was not until 1975, when Fleetwood Mac recorded their heavily praised self-titled album there (a serendipitous and well documented story in the movie), that the tiny studio landed on the rock map and began attracting artists who wanted to come and record there.<br /><br />Overwhelmingly throughout the documentary, artists' recollection of their first impression of the studio was that it was a complete dump... many nearly refusing to record there as a result.<br /><br />However, what Sound City lacked in polish, flash or even clean furniture... it more than made up for with something that no other studio at the time had.<br /><br />** The Neve Console **<br /><br />The Neve console was designed and manufactured by Neve Electronics for high-end recording studios during the 1970s and was the last of the \\"80 series\\" hand-wired analog mixing consoles.<br /><br />It was a custom-built beast that could record and produce a unique and organic sound that could not be replicated by other studios. It was this sound that attracted such artists as Tom Petty, Pat Benatar, Rick Springfield, Nice Inch Nails, Nirvana, REO Speedwagon, Metallica, Johnny Cash, The Grateful Dead, Rage Against the Machine, Tool, The Arctic Monkeys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fleetwood Mac and even Barry Manilow (go figure).<br /><br />The Neve console features prominently in the telling of Sound City's story, as it was also the catalyst for the creation of the film. When Grohl learned that the famed studio would be closing its doors, he purchased the console to ensure its place in rock history and installed it in his own studio.<br /><br />Which leads me to one of my favorite parts of the film.<br /><br />** Jam Session **<br /><br />After Grohl dismantled, moved, cleaned (not an easy task according to Dave) and reassembled the famed Neve console, he invited back many of the artists whose careers were launched at Sound City.<br /><br />The result was one of my favorite sections of the film, as the likes of Trent Reznor, Stevie Nicks, Josh Homme, Paul McCartney and Rick Springfield tried to recreate the sound and vibe of the famed studio by recording the film's soundtrack.<br /><br />I particularly loved this part of the film because I find it amazingly inspirational to see the creative and collaborative process between truly talented musicians. Just the portion between Reznor, Homme and Grohl is a reminder of what true artists actually are... and quite frankly made me resent the manufactured, auto-tuned and over-produced-pop crap that passes as \\"music\\" today.<br /><br />Later, you are treated to Paul McCartney (whom I have never been much a fan of during his post Beatles / Wings career), but I developed a new-found appreciation for him after this documentary. Again, witnessing the collaborative nature of real musicians is a sight to see... and hear.<br /><br />Which leads me to my next topic.<br /><br />** Digital Killed The Analog Star **<br /><br />One of the major reasons that Sound City eventually went under, was due in large part to the introduction of digital recording and audio editing programs such as Pro Tools.<br /><br />Nowhere in the film does Grohl levy an indictment against digital recording (nor is it my intent to do so in this review), but rather makes the point that because of it, the music industry is unlikely to see another Sound City emerge or thrive again.<br /><br />In a time when you can easily record, manipulate and produce music from your bedroom, the days of artists creating a truly organic musical experience in the studio is quickly dwindling. In fact, it is my opinion that Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters are one of the only bands remaining who proudly carry and wave the `rock banner' above a sea of mediocre and short lived musical acts that no one will remember in 10 years.<br /><br />In the beginning of the documentary, you learn to appreciate the inherent challenges (and benefits) of recording on tape. Many artists had to play straight through a song, even if it meant dozens of takes in order to get it right and match the sound, since editing in those days is not what is is today.<br /><br />Nowadays, you can record an entire album without having any band members present. Each member can come in, record their individual parts and call it a day... since it can all be mixed together later or \\"fixed\\" in post. This disconnect and dependence on technology is what the film truly laments and is what Sound City was able to provide.<br /><br />Every artist featured in the film remarked about the unique sound that the space at Sound City produced, especially for drums and vocals... one that they were never able to replicate at another studio. This, coupled with the Neve console and the audio engineers who ran it over the years, is what combined to produce some of the most memorable recordings in history.<br /><br />I venture to guess that what was considered a unique sound at Sound City, would be filtered, flattened or processed out by something like Pro Tools today.<br /><br />If you consider yourself a music fan, it should be required viewing for you to see this movie. For a first-time director, Dave Grohl does an outstanding job and the film is paced perfectly.es Grohl levy an indictment against digital recording (nor is it my intent to do so in this review), but rather makes the point that because of it, the music industry is unlikely to see another Sound City emerge or thrive again.<br /><br />In a time when you can easily record, manipulate and produce music from your bedroom, the days of artists creating a truly organic musical experience in the studio is quickly dwindling.

B009VB97EY|3.0|If you wanna see hot men take off their clothes and then somehow still manage to objectify women, here ya go.  Matthew McConaughey was entertaining to watch if you enjoy seeing guys be extra, over the top creepy gross and mildly homoerotic.  (I'm pretty sure they threw that in for a certain slice of the demographic sure to watch a movie about male strippers.)  He even plays a bongo drum and tosses out a few &#34;All right, all right, all rights,&#34; for those of us who know his storied history.<br /><br />Overall, Magic Mike was cheesy, light on plot and writing and heavy on nasty...just as you'd expect.

B008F9E306|3.0|When I first heard \\"Trap Back Jumpin\\" a while back I eagerly awaited yet another T.I. album. I've loved all his stuff, being a fan since I first heard \\"Trap Muzik\\" and then all the way through \\"Paper Trail\\" which although I enjoyed, was definitely more of a step towards pop music. And Trouble Man continues that trend in my opinion.<br /><br />Thats not to say there isnt some good music here, and you still get some of the old T.I we all knew on songs like \\"G Season\\" I really dig the Introduction as well. But I can't say I'm really feeling the songs with R. Kelley, Pink, and Lil Wayne. Too much pop for my taste. Plus the album just didnt quite have the energy I've come to expect from T.I. A lot of the songs are just kind of mellow.<br /><br />Not terrible overall, I'll still remain a T.I. fan! This album's probably still worth picking up, especially if you liked Paper Trail
0812982622|4.0|It was very well written, but I had trouble keeping track of who the characters were at a particular moment. Interesting characters, though and the picture it portrayed of N. Korea was unique. Reminded me of &#34;1984&#34;.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have enjoyed this series more than any I have seen in a long time.  It is the best....casting.....scenery.......acting!  Refreshing to see a show that doesn't rely on profanity, violence, and sex to be interesting.  Can't wait til the next Season.  Keep up the good work!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was great.  Never knew what was happening.  Kept you going and did not want to put it down until the end.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I rarely believe the hype for $.99 ebooks, but this looked like a good, interesting premise, so I took the plunge. I'm no physicist or engineer; the whole book could be mathematical BS, but I bought it. It's a good story, kind of quirky, funny in a geeky sort of way, fundamentally believable because the character development is fundamentally believable. And it's a feel-good story completely devoid of bad guys, which is a good diversion in itself.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the whole 3 seasons of Downton Abby.  The characters, storyline, and the history of that time era in London.<br />It's wonderful!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Kudos to Mr. Follett for another epic read.  This novel stands on its own,without  needing to read Pillars of the Earth beforehand.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|I have to be honest - there is nothing seriously flawed with this movie at all, it is just  that I  didn't think it was that great.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple( as it often the case in animated family movies).<br /><br />In this case, Count Dracula doesn't want his baby girl- MAVIS- who is finally turning 118 yrs old( no typo there)- to grow up and go out in the world.<br /><br />The world is an unfriendly place, especially to monsters like them.  Dracula is a doting dad ever fearful of losing his girl.<br /><br />He has already lost too much in his life and he dreads the idea of her desire to spread her little bat wings and fly out, on her own.<br /><br />What is nice is that while this is an animated movie- it touches on a theme all loving parents can relate to.<br /><br />NO PARENT WHO ADORES THEIR KID(S) REALLY WANTS THEM TO LEAVE  HOME FOR GOOD AND CERTAINLY, THEY FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY IN THAT BIG, WIDE WORLD OUT THERE.<br /><br />The computer graphics are very well done and Adam Sandler is almost unrecognizable as the voice of Count Dracula, except  for those moments while watching, when you suddenly remember he is playing Dracula. :-)<br /><br /> He did a good job of disappearing right into the role.<br /><br />( You will be surprised by the many stars who played various monster voices for this movie).<br /><br />I did find a lot of the action sequences a bit dizzying and I am all for action in regular movies, but in an animated film, it all felt a bit overwhelming visually.<br /><br />Almost like your eyes can't follow the action fast enough.<br /><br /> The entire movie roughly covers Mavis' big birthday bash.<br /><br />The one her father has planned for her 118th birthday.<br /><br />He has gone through great lengths to make it special, all the while trying to hide his great fear of her desire to go out and explore the world.  He knows she is going to undoubtedly bring this desire up to him, now that she is 118.<br /><br />All starts out smoothly for the party, until an unsuspecting interloper some how gets into the Hotel Transylvania- a Hotel dedicated  to being a safe and peaceful haven strictly for vacationing monsters of all sorts.<br /><br />Having an intruder show up, is where the story takes a wild turn and the action gets really crazy.<br /><br />Loved the ending sequence of the movie- the music was great if you are of the right age to enjoy it. May  not be everyone's bag, but for those who found their foot taping or their leg bouncing, you might want to check the film's soundtrack info on AMAZON.<br /><br />I know there was a lot of praise for this movie, so maybe my expectations were just a bit too high.  Or maybe others will agree with me.  It was OKAY- but not anything great.<br /><br />Again, I will say the graphics are terrific, but in an era where animated films no longer being drawn ala*  old Disney style*, there are better animated movies out there to check out.<br /><br />If this movie's monster theme is something that really appeals to you( and any kids you may have), then perhaps you will like this better than the typical viewer.for the party, until an unsuspecting interloper some how gets into the Hotel Transylvania- a Hotel dedicated  to being a safe and peaceful haven strictly for vacationing monsters of all sorts.<br /><br />Having an intruder show up, is where the story takes a wild turn and the action gets really crazy.<br /><br />Loved the ending sequence of the movie- the music was great if you are of the right age to enjoy it.

B009WO7NQO|1.0|I loved Angry Birds and am disgusted by the shameless attempt to make more money by selling a product that a player can only access one level and pay for the rest. This isn't a real video game, it's slinging fragile objects and normally immovable objects. It's not worth $20 for the experience.
B009ZE27US|3.0|Age scanner is a good novelty app; which is also it's weakness in that the fun wears off quickly it is not a knock of the quality of the app, but rather how novelty apps lose their appeal after the first hundred tries. Still worth the download.

A must have app for any casual or hardcore gamer.

My only complaint is that since my purchase on here I jave never got an update to the app of any kind. Looking on the google play store I am multiple versions behind, like way behind. I purchased here, I will not repurchase on the play store, in fact I purchase nothing there so the dev not updating here stinks. Please update at least a couple times a year, thats not so much to ask I don't think.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Really enjoyable start..felt like an action thriller along the lines of a female da vinci code...then about a third of the way in...it turned into a bit of a trite romance with a side of mysteryish. Then it lost points for turning into a trilogy when it could have been a single good book. Another star down because #3 isn't even out yet. I didn't bother with 2.<br />So 3 stars for being a fun light romance with witches and vampires and being a page turner. If you go into it knowing is a trilogy and those things it would be much better.

0385344228|3.0|I read this after finishing Gone Girl and it's surprising how much better Gone Girl is written than Defending Jacob. Defending Jacob is an interesting read and a page-turner, however it is bogged down with lengthy explanations of hashtags, facebook, and many legal terms and procedures. I think the story Landay wanted to tell (given the ending) could have been told more effectively with a bit more focus.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Although there were three stories wrapped up in this one that was made into a movie it was a good movie.  I recognized all the other stories woven into it.  Judi Dench, of course, was wonderful.  She is so versatile.

I love how it tells me how much longer I have in terms of minutes, although the Kindle Fire does not have all those functions. Choosing the battery display color makes me want to use it more often. The graph is also a nice feature. If you just want to be able to check out your battery life, this is the app to use. Enjoy!

B000PC0S5K|4.0|Excellent book.  I give it 4 stars because his excellent description of how ego forms and is reinforced.  I don't give it a 5 because I see three deficiencies.  1.  He seems to under value history.  It seems to me that history is a vehicle of revelation and truth, he almost seems to dismiss this.  I agree we should not attach our identity to past ego-enhancing events, but it seems to me that God has used and does use history as a way to disclose himself.  2.  He speaks about not reinforcing ego on one hand, but when the chips are down he does advocate some self-protection.  I think this is a mistake.  We should certainly leave a violent and dangerous situation, but there is no need to assert ourselves to protect a false-self which will not survive death.  3.  I don't think it is sufficient enough to be in the present.  I think living in the present is essential, but it must be filled with a particular content, namely trust and love.  Or identity does need a formation through attachment to something and that something needs to be transcendent, namely, God.  This is why trust needs to be a part of our orientation to the present.  The outflow of that connection to God is love flowing through us.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have seen this movie several times already.  I am a big fan of Richard Armitage as a result of seeing him in this movie.  Although the movie deviates from the story Elizabeth Gaskell wrote it is still a really good movie.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I bought this cover because it was half the cost of a Kindle cover.  Purple isn't my favorite color but it does the job, protects my Kindle.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|If you are in the mood for a fun fast read, this is the book for you.  The details are simple and beautiful and make you wonder why you are being told certain information.<br /><br />I recommend this book to an adult audience.
B00ADQ7JCS|5.0|So this is what happens when John Young (Bonnie Tyler Band/Scorpions), Nick Beggs (Kagagoogoo), Martin Beedle (Cutting Crew) & sound engineer Steve Rispin (Uriah Heep/Virgil & The Accelerators) get to spend some time together. Not obviously a formula for progressive rock but when you look deeper into their history you'll find links to Asia, John Wetton, Greenslade, Fish, The Skys & Steven Wilson. Add to this a list of special guests reading Robin Boult (Fish/Howard Jones), Thijs van Leer (Focus), Jakko Jakszyk (King Crimson) & Steve Hackett (Genesis) and you get what is an absolute gem not only for those with prog at heart but anyone who enjoys quality rock music.<br />Five songs in 54 minutes (not really long enough guys) with the shortest song 'At The End Of The World' coming in at 8:23.<br />John Young's Keyboards & Vocals are the obvious force behind this release and fans of his previous work ('Significance', 'JYB Live' & 'Life Underground')should not be scared off by the prog label as there are many sections of this release which will be familiar to them but although Nick Beggs (whose opening bass riff to 'Fridge Full Of Stars' is an absolute classic) & Martin 'Frosty' Beedle play a major role in creating the ambience of the music contained here the silent star is sound engineer Steve Rispin who gives the songs a depth & texture that make it a modern classic and that is before you add three great guitar performances and the legend that is Thijs van Leer on flute.<br />Whether you go for the soon to be available Limited Edition (250) Vinyl edition or the CD, followers of Genesis, Yes, Marillion, It Bites, Focus, King Crimson, Jethro Tull & IQ will find instant pleasure here but  any lover of good music should give this a try. Don't be 'Too Shy', Dive In.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|OMG, this is the worst book I've ever read.  As someone wrote here in the review it seems this was written by a teenager.  I hate it!  I wish we could give minus stars because one star is too much on this!
0765325950|5.0|There are no words to sum these 14 books. I lack that gift of thought to words. This book is just.....WOW. Now after all these years, I miss Matt, Egwene, Rand, Etc......I miss them all. Cried. Laughed. Felt their pain, their joys. Robert Jordan was and is the Bloody Man. Thank you Brandon Sanderson.....thank you.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I've been eagerly awaiting this since the end of resident evil afterlife, and was blown away when I watched it.<br /><br />a must have for fans of the movie series.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book reminded me of the catcher in the rye. I really recommend this book to anyone. The connection you'll have with Charlie is amazing.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|I saw this series on machinama prime in the leadup to halo 4's launch.<br /><br />impressed doesnt even cover it.<br /><br />if you're interested in more backstory for the chief and lasky, this is the disc to own.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|If you don't try and compare this to the original, you are going to enjoy the movie. Lots of action, great acting, special effects. Movies should be made for our enjoyment, so we can escape our world for for 90 minutes and enter theirs. This movie does all that and more. Highly reccomended.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Loved the story....characters was cool and very colorful. The movie is very inspirational and  is something kids could learn from.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a very unique game. I love it and play it a lot. The new mobs were a great addition.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Bought this movie for my godson he saw the movie once and insist that he have his own copy of this movie.
034580404X|5.0|The first book is a little rank with the desriptions by Ana.  But the second and third books are good reading
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I expected a bit more from the NYT Best Seller. Whilst the plot was was relatively unpredictable, I found the dialogue between characters awkward. Worth a read though...
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Although this games is great fun you only get one level with your purchase, for each additional level they want more money.  Cut me a break.  They never mentioned this when you buy the game.  Thanks alot amazon.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game even more than coin dozer seasons, more chances to have coins shake and bump into the pit.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book!  There are many aspects of 11/22/63 that are so interesting.  I loved going back in time with Jake/George. As the plot developed, I began to feel that I was living in 1960.  This is a great book if you enjoy historical novels!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It is a must read if you enjoyed the first book. E. L James is an amazing writer!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I love the watch but to me it isn't really that user friendly.  I would rather just push a button and go -- it takes me a bit of messing around with it before I can start working out.  It's probably just me -- I am not exactly tech savy
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book! It is a great adult novel! I would recommend this to anyone! But you will not be able to put the book down.
1926778537|5.0|I found the collection very full of content. The quality of the concepts and the art styles of Joe Madureira and Paul Richards (although always spot on) jumped to many next levels this time.<br />It was very inspirational and it tells you how to design for gaming like a sir! :)
B005PR2FD8|5.0|Imma big fan of tekken I grew up on the games watched all the old movies and u think this was was the best one I've seen
B000URDE2Y|5.0|This is without question, Robin Trowers' best work. This album is a must have for all collectors. The guitar works are pure perfection. This is Trower at his very best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super fun and very realistic. The horse ways about as much as a real house does. Love it. You should try
0783240287|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals. I bought this DVD specifically to see Donny Osmond in the role of Joseph. He delivers! One of the best productions I've ever seen. Donny Osmond is amazing. And the story of Joseph is true to the Genesis account in the Bible. Every type of music is utilized. Lots of fun and very entertaining for all ages.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Love this app.  Works great with Google calendar. I have it on my droid razr also. How can you beat it for free?
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Words have not been invented that could ever fully describe this true American hero.<br />GOD bless him and his loved ones all.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Love her & her beautiful voice & her song choices.  Inspiring & calming to listen to.  Enjoy any of her albums.
B005K17RU0|4.0|AccuWeather is great and I would have given it 5 stars but have not used it long enough to know if it gives warnings.  On first glance I like better than the other weather apps because it gives lots of information I'm looking for in just one touch.  Seems very easy to use.
B0086700CM|5.0|BIG IMPROVEMENT FROM THE FIRST ONE!!!!!!<br />BETTER OBSTICLES!!!!!! ZIPLINES!!!!!!!!!!!<br />MINE CARTS TO RIDE IN!!!!!!!! GEMS TO COLLECT!!!!!!<br /><br />BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|It was painful to read this through to the end.  It dragged on and on and I thought it would never end.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I have LOVED the Resident Evil series since they began. Not a gamer, just a sci-fi buff and I have faithfully watched and enjoyed every single one of them until this one. Geesh, what were they thinking?<br /><br />There was no plot, no building of characters...nothing. Actually, it also would not stream (did not let that affect the rating). It cut out so many times we gave up even trying to watch it. The husband said, &#34;That was so bad I feel Amazon's bad streaming tonight saved us from the worst movie we have watched in years.&#34; I can watch almost anything sci-fi and I always finish a movie, even just so I can whine about it. Not this one. Did not even try to stream it the next day. I am sooo disappointed in what has been a fun thrill ride with Alice.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|The album is easy to listen to. Some songs are a little lost but for most part is an excellent album.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun. must download. best horse game ever. get it. even if it costs. u must get this game.I'll find u if u don't get this game.
B00AWBNNAG|4.0|This a great little app for &quot;brickheads&quot;.  Never have to look for an instruction book. Coveiniantly displays on you tablet, like the Kindle Fire HD rightamonstthe bricks you're putting together.  The only thing I found amiss was the instruction page listing the parts does not display.  LEGO problem or?
B0041KVZ18|1.0|I bought (and returned) three copies of this record.  All of them had quality problems of some sort -- warping, pops/cracks, static and weird background noise, distorted sound.  After the third defective one I decided to return for refund, I give up on trying to get a good copy...<br /><br />This is sold and priced as an audiophile release- not even close!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have read Gone GIRL and Sharp Objects, this book doesn't disappoint! I couldn't put it down, and I loved how you got to know each character so well and could read each of their sides of the story. It was so twisted and suspenseful, just lie Flynn's other two books, pace set by the book was fast but didn't give anything away leaving you guessing and having to read the next chapter right away. Flynn has a way of writing her main characters with dry humour and hard realities, not sugar coating the twisted and gruesome facts! Ready for her next book, she is one of my new favorite authors!
B006LSZECO|3.0|No, that's not really the question.  The question is, \\"Why do writers publish books when they can't come up with a decent ending?\\"  I know that wrapping up a story satisfactorily is VERY difficult - the proof is all around us.  I enjoyed this book right up until I realized that, in the end, the author had no idea what to do with the monsters she had created for us.  The ending was completely unsatisfactory.  Meh.  Novels like this are not about the \\"journey\\".  The journey needs to be good, but the destination needs to be awesome - whether it makes us feel vindicated, or angry, or anguished, or joyful.  It should never make us feel \\"meh.\\"<br /><br />If you want to read this book, I suggest borrowing it from a library.  It's not one that I want to keep after reading.
B000P2A256|5.0|This CD is great. Listen to it all the time in the car. So many great songs on this one.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Michael Connelly does it again. Harry is back and maybe his most glowing case yet. Who says retirement is boring?
B005EVVESM|5.0|Love this CD. So many great songs. I listen to it all the time in the car. Great driving music.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|I spent the last year working on a business.  And I was aware of Lean Startup as a book and as a concept. But I didn't read the book, because I didn't think I was a startup.<br /><br />Ries defines a startup as an endeavor being undertaken in conditions of extreme uncertainty.  And Lean Startup is about what to do in conditions where traditional business forecasting won't work, because there is no way to predict what will happen.<br /><br />I did not, alas, know that a year ago.  And by the time I did buy Lean Startup, and realized that it's what I needed, my business had already failed... because the conditions were too uncertain, and we didn't know how to handle them.<br /><br />Don't be me. If you're running a business, read this book.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|They canceled Phoenix on this tour so Im glad they made a dvd concert. I have watched it and it is really good. Hope the next tour they come back to Phoenix.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Story about a talented person coming to grips with his failings.  Having worked in a community with a very strict drug and alcohol abuse policy, it was hard to watch since it forced the realization that one of our communities that should have the most restrictive policies, may have gaps and loopholes.  After working for a short period in another community and having observed several undetected or ignored drug and alcohol abusers, I realize many companies just can't afford to randomly drug test as advertised.  I suspect the same cost benefit analysis may apply to the airline industry.<br />As many have noted, the gratuitous sex was really unnecessary.  Denzel deserves high marks for acting in a difficult role.  I know characters like John Goodman exist, but  . . . I have always purposely avoided them in real life.<br />The storyline does get the point across, but the writer and director missed an opportunity to explore the social issues and provide alternative versus traditional outcomes.<br />Frankly, we could see where this movie was heading after the first 45 minutes so we fast forwarded to the end. The ending was as anticipated.
0385040253|5.0|This book is the &#34;bible&#34; in the nautical knot world.  I am very pleased with the discounted price I paid.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I got this as part of the FAOTD but now that I have used it I feel it is well worth the cost.  I especially like the fact that they have many more free sounds out there to choose from if you don't like the ones that come with the app.  I can't speak to the issues others have complained about regarding the insistance on submitting a review.  It did ask me but I wanted to submit one so problem solved.  If you find that to be an issue I recommend you just submit a quick &quot;got it, use it, moderatly happy with it&quot; review.  I have submitted some feature suggestions to the developer so we will see if they are responsive and I may update my review to reflect my experiences at a later date.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this one better than the original because it's more anxious......you worry what you high score will be or if you pass the train tunnel......it's like having an anxiety
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I guess growing up and living in the Dirty D makes for a good album.  I am still amazed at how this went unnoticed in the U.S. for so long.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Seldom do I find myself talking to the characters as I am reading a book. But, I was so involved with Anna as I read I felt as if she were someone I knew . I can't wait to download the next book.
0525952926|5.0|Follett does it again.  His portrayal of the struggles and joys that his main characters experience are vivid and real.  His ability to intersect the lives of so many families in so many countries is amazing.  I loved the novel and am so looking forward to the next book in the trilogy as he writes about new generations and adventures in the remainder of the twentieth century!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games<br /><br />Couldn't put it down was excellent from page one up to the ending am anxiously awaiting more from the author
0446560065|5.0|My daughter loves this book...actually so do the rest of us. Having a couple of cats we can really relate to this fabulous feline!
B001AQR3MQ|5.0|Though I disagree with reincarnation, I still like this movie. Its a great love story but the visual depictions of Heaven and Hell are truly amazing.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. We watched it together and I really enjoyed it myself. I'm sure we'll see it again and again!
B008476HBM|5.0|This book has been one of my go-to happy books for a long time. It doesn't matter what's going in my life, Pride and Prejudice is always a fun, readable, delightful time.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|Both my husband & my daughter like this game. They enjoy playing it together. My daughter loves to fly the helicopter.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love being able to watch Downton at our convenience, no commercials, and the whole season in one place.  Now we need to get more episodes!!!
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I have spent a lot of time and money on this game. $25+ And WHO KNOWS how many hours while recovering from surgery. Today,  I find that my shark is back to normal with NO UPGRADES! I loved this game and have recommend it to many apply!I hope I can get it back! Otherwise I would definitely recommend this game. But if you don't buy the upgrades you won't get anywhere
B008BRC6NS|4.0|I have always felt neutral about JLo - there are better actresses/singers out there but there are also those that are a lot worse than her.  She is beautiful, has marketed herself well for the past decade and I consider her to be a veteran in the music/hollywood scene.  Because I was never particularly attracted to JLo's music, this was my very first album and I bought it to have something upbeat for the gym and my commute to work.  I like that I am familiar with all the songs on the album, many which have been remixed and updated.  If anyone already owns her previous albums or even just her popular songs that have made it onto the radio, then this purchase wouldn't be worth it because there are less than a handful of new songs.  So far, this album has kept me singing along and moving to the music and I'm not bored on the treadmill!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read all the Harry Bosch novels, and this one was probably the best.  Connelly weaves a great story that will keep you with it to the end.
B004SRNH10|5.0|As always Adobe works great, easy to use. Havent had any problems at all. Thanks .. What else can I say ?
B0000C1733|4.0|This was a nice, in tact CD with a good conditioned case and a good disc inside. It lived up to  my expectations and I'm able to get great use out of it.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love this program, I play it while my husband is on the net and enjoy teasing him.  This is fun and easy to use.
B000067CPX|4.0|This was a nice, in tact CD with a good conditioned case and a good disc inside. It lived up to  my expectations and I'm able to get great use out of it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I've used Yahoo for years on my PC and now on my Kindle Fire, works great, different look, but easy to use.
B00000J7JO|4.0|This was a nice, in tact CD with a good conditioned case and a good disc inside. It lived up to  my expectations and I'm able to get great use out of it.
B0058W74UY|5.0|Haven't had any problems from this app.  Easy to install, enjoying my Kindle Fire and all the apps I have downloaded. Thanks
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The case was fine, lightweight enough, although the edges feel a bit sharp.<br /><br />My problem is with the Kindle Fire.  I cannot save my read books into a seperate folder, like i can do on my old Kindle.  That is a major problem for me.
B000SEJHRA|3.0|I couldn't get past the first few pages.  Will pick it up at a later date and see if I like it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|overall great app for sharing photography and personal pica. ive loved it since I downloaded it a few weeks ago.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I bought this book on a whim, and am happy that I did.  It's a fun little read, well worth the money.  I read some of the reviews, both positive and negative, and am amazed at what some folk have as an expectation for a $3 book.  Yes, there are a few grammar problems, but none worth grousing about.  One person, in deriding the book titled the comment \\"Its already ben done\\".  Is it possible that that was a typo, or was the misspelling of 'ben' a comment on his reading.<br /><br />I enjoyed it.
B00AANGHXQ|3.0|THE LATEST STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN SONY LEGACY RELEASE OFFERS NOTHING NEW FOR THE HARDCORE SRV FAN. DISC 1 SOUNDS THE SAME AS THE LAST REMASTER AND THE ONE BONUS TRACK WAS ALREADY ISSUED ON THE PREVIOUS REMASTER AS WELL. DISC TWO, RECORDED LIVE AT RIPLEY'S MUSIC HALL IN PHILADELPHIA ON OCTOBER 20, 1983 IS ONE OF STEVIE'S BEST CONCERTS EVER BUT IT'S PRESENTED HERE IN EDITED FORM AND IS MISSING FOUR TRACKS, \\"LENNY\\", \\"RUDE MOOD\\", \\"TELL ME\\", AND \\"SCUTTLE BUTTIN'\\". THE COMPLETE SHOW HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR YEARS AS PART OF AN IMPORT BOX SET CALLED \\"IN MEMORIUM\\". IT CLOCKS IN AT 77:40 WHILE THE SONY LEGACY VERSION CLOCKS IN AT 58:05. SONY CERTAINLY HAS ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE SHOW SO WHY LEAVE OUT FOUR SONGS? THE SOUND QUALITY ON THE COMPLETE VERSION IS BETTER TOO. THE VAUGHAN ESTATE SHOULD CONSIDER DOING A LIVE SRV BOX AND INCLUDE THE COMPLETE LIVE IN TOKYO SHOW AND THE TWO CONCERTS THAT MTV AIRED BACK IN THE DAY. STEVIE DESERVES BETTER AND SO DO THE FANS.
0451232852|5.0|I enjoyed the book immensely. I have suggested it to many friends and have given copies to relatives. The beginning is reminiscent of &#34;Upstairs,Downstairs&#34; and &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; but quickly goes far beyond those stories to encompass much more. This is a significant book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|good game.  hope it doesn't crash on me again. lost all progress from level 65.  still like it enough to start over
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Very good second book some things were predictable but the way they were presented keeps you locked into reading would recommend to all my friends!!
0307593312|5.0|This huge book took a little while to read but I can't think of any better authors. This book was far better than expected.
B007THA4FI|3.0|A bit disappointing. I found it hard to keep all the characters straight and the plot was only mildly engaging.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Both my wife and I could not wait watching a few episodes per night, until we finished the entire series. Great entertainment.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love this CD. Arrived on time and with great service. I definitely would recommend this to anyone else who loves the musical.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|The games are very challenging - still trying to get 3 stars on quite a few of the games.  Those little pigs are going down..
B006R1T40I|5.0|GREAT CD. IF YOU LIKE BONNIE  you will love this..CHECK THIS CD OUT.<br />.HER BEST IN YEARS!!<br /> LOVE IT...LOVE IT...LOVE IT!!!
030726999X|5.0|This series was far too short.  Readers everywhere were mesmerized!  We lost a great author far too soon!!  Thank you.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Love Phillip Phillips.  Great CD!!!!  If you're a Phillip Phillips fan you'll absolutely love this CD.  The CD arrived as promised in great condition.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest has so many hobies and crafts to follow, i have made copied many of the ideas, the family pictures tree is one of them!!
B009K0OL06|4.0|We enjoy this series and had missed taping two of them.  Nice way to catch up without breaking the bank.
B0014YVCDK|5.0|Some people will say this is not their favorite album, while I agree it's not my favorite album, I do like it a lot.  The sound is richer and the music a bit more punk.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|National Lampoon should prepare you for what you should expect. Some people love It's a Wonderful Life. Some people love A Christmas Story. I love them both and have added National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation as one of my must watch holiday classic movies.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|That idea of putting all of the songs that did not make it on their other albums is genius.  I highly recommend this album.
B0091REZMW|4.0|More diamonds please, I'm a cheap skate and won't pay for them, maybe 2 bucks for unlocked app is all. Dang I need more words to finish the review
B000ETQRCM|5.0|The self titled Pearl Jam album had one of the best songs in it.  I cannot relate to anyone who after listening to &#34;Come Back&#34; does not want to buy this album.
1599290634|5.0|Packaged very well and received very timely.<br /><br />Great communication and price.<br /><br />Will do business with this vendor again.<br /><br />Well received.
B004HZYHGM|4.0|An old classic I read many years ago. I found it to be very likable and entertaining even with some of the &#34;Pirate&#34; lingo being hard to understand at times
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I i love subway surfer  it is fun for all ages i lllllloooovvveeeee subway surfers do u know i am in cali. That is farawatfhhf gdhddhdvyff fhfhxncbbcbcc fhfhfhcjfnfbfhfj fjfbjkiugty hknvxdvbvdg
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great simple calculator that remembers everything that I do. I love how big it is. This is the best calculator app.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|It's VERY DIFFICULT to control the rotational position of the workspace. The tile group just spins erratically at the slightest touch on the screen. I've never seen a 3D game so hard to control before. I do like Mahjong, but you have to have a whole lot of patience for this one. Maybe it works better on other devices, but on my Kindle Fire it was not good. Good thing I picked it up as the faotd. I would be upset if I had paid for it.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|This is definitely one of his worst offerings ever!!  He spent more time figuring out ways to be a wiseguy than he did figuring out how to write this story so that the reader wouldn't fall asleep.  Absolute trash!
B00AKYRCNY|4.0|This is a entertaining puzzle app it will keep little ones busy for a long time moving the the puzzle pieces. There are many different puzzles to do. Your child will want to play it over and over.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Nice when you're not at home and have your Kindle somewhere with no computers access. Still have a time getting used to the touch system to type. I'm sure the more I use it the better I'll get.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|The HDTV I bought had a headphone jack but there was a loud hum when using it. I bought an RCA to 3.5 mm adapter and used it to run my headphones from the Blu-ray player RCA output jacks, through this amp, and the hum is gone. Makes me smile!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Just like the one on TV and the internet. Very handy when you're out and about and the weather looks shady. It also alerts you to special weather conditions in your area!
B0053B347M|5.0|I bought an RCA HDTV 32&#34; and these LEDs make the picture seem much better. The HDTV I bought has a USB port into which the LEDs plug and are switched on and off with the TV. Convenient.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Narrows down your search with the different sections to go to. Works just like regular Google, which I love anyway!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The last 2 paragraphs tugged at my heart strings strongly.<br />Amazing! I can't wait to see the movie! !!!! !!!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Just like the ones on the table tops back in the day, sound and all! Get just as crazy excited playing this as I did then. If you like Pacman back in the day, you'll like this.
1250000971|5.0|Fantastic book. Great author.  Can't wait to read the last of The Clifton Chronicles.  Have read many of his books.
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|Just got my Kindle and have been experimenting with all the freebies. So far I really like this. Very user friendly.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I totally loved this book, can't wait to read next one. Great way to bring back Macon. Hope Ridley gets her powers back.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Sooooo cool. Love FB, love to check on my friends and family. It is harder for me to type messages on it because of the touch keyboard, but having it wherever I go with Wifi is great!
B0097UGXFK|5.0|kids love it. already watched it many times and read the books . looking forward to a nice weekend and typing more words for the review
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Despite being fantasy, Game of Thrones feels like an historical medieval tale. 7 Kingdoms are united by a single throne. Ruling families are full of greedy and ambitious characters. Nobody trusts each other. The arse sitting on the thrown never stays put for very long, and murder is a proven way of removing that royal tuckus. The game is one of life and death, and many people are playing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've actually bought all of the previous seasons and watched a good many of them twice.<br />Very attached to the characters by now. Didn't think this show could be so addictive, but it fooled me.<br />Leave it to the UK to come up  with great character development, and a good plot.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is a wonderful story teller.  By using a repeat protagonist, Harry Bosch, a gritty detective, you become thoroughly engaged with the tale...
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I'll admit, I wasn't too fond of getting part III with this but, the first two were more than worth the price I paid here on Amazon. And it's on Blue Ray?  No brainer.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|John Williams' score for LINCOLN belongs decidedly to the category of his \\"serious, mature\\" movie scores.  The music is strongly reminiscent of Aaron Copland's quintessentially \\"American\\" style without ever being hackneyed or merely a pastische; on the contrary, it is melodically inspired and magnificent.  And yet the LINCOLN score deserves to be every bit as much a part of our national consciousness as Copland's compositions are.  I can only hope that someday this will be the case.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Once I started this book I had a hard time putting it down. The characters and their relationships were well drawn and the story is one to remember.
0345803493|2.0|There's a sex scene on the piano.  Does this woman think she's the only one who remembers \\"Pretty Woman\\"?<br />The weak tea with no milk is an insulting Brit cliche on how Americans take their tea.  We are NOT all that pathetic.<br />What's really appalling is her heroine freaks out about his B&D room, but is no more than slightly peeved that he just bought the company she's working for, has people spying on her from the street to see where she goes, and has hacked into her bank account (to transfer IN money, of course).  If it were me, I'd probably look at the red room and say, \\"Oh, you're into that?  I'm not, sorry,\\" but if I found out somebody was stalking me like that and getting professional and economic control of my life, I'd go ballistic. This woman's judgment of what is truly dangerous and what is some people's kink and not others' is completely warped--and I say this as someone who is, at best, vanilla with cinnamon sprinkles (according to some scene friends).  God help any female readers who use this to frame their ideas of what is romantic.<br />Since we're on the subject, I've been told by people who ARE into the scene that Maggie Gyllenhaal's character in the movie \\"Secretary\\" is closer to that of an actual submissive.  Her relationship with James Spader's character frees her from self-hatred and self-harming behaviors, and she ends up being the stubborn and stronger one who insists on maintaining the relationship, when he has trouble accepting his desires.<br />And by the way--Spader's character was \\"Mr. Grey.\\"
B004FS1TLM|5.0|Michael brings his own style to music made popular by earlier favorite artists like Frank Sinatra, Jack Jones etc.  So easy to listen to.  Enough romance to inspire even the hard rock fans when they venture out of their regular comfort zone.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Having seen the Broadway production years ago and now the epic film i am better able to grasp the magnitude of the era. This CD is mesmerizing in its production. As I listen I am transported back to relive the film over and over. The troughs and crests of some songs add a haunting flavor.  When melodies and lyrics plant themselves in your mind on replay mode, you have a hit!  How splendid to awaken each day with the glorious \\"One day more\\" reaching its crescendo!  Embrace the day! Two thumbs up to this five star film and cd!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|More favorites from Michael.  Sooo easy to listen to and selections take me back to times when young people actually danced together...not like today...doing their &#34;own thing&#34;.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|The movie came in good condition as advertised.  The children are enjoying it profusely and glad there were no scratches or skips.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Most people enjoy holiday music and if you are a Michael Buble fan, you will enjoy this addition to your collection.  Christmas isn't just for the little kids...this music takes me back to a time when we actually listened to this music at holiday gatherings!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This met my needs to a tee!!! I LOVE-LOVE it. And I love that it is white it is easy to keep up with and to pick it out from all the other cords.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Am a new fan.  Have not listened to Alicia Keys in the past, other than seeing her on TV etc.  Her story telling in her music adds a very interesting dimension...it's wonderful to be able to understand the words she sings!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The story is very gripping. The author provides do much detail that you can easily picture what is going on.
B005EVVESM|5.0|Adam Levine and his group offer up tempo music for every mood...good walk-along music when I'm getting my fresh air walks. The addition of Lady Antebellum & Christina Aguilera is a bonus.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Definitely ended different than I expected. Good book though. Took a little while to really catch your attention in the beginning.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play all the time it's so much fun! Great game for all ages<br /> Young and old<br />I highly recommend it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh this is the best game I have got so far n it gets very easy and simple once u get the trick.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am late to the table with this series.  Only just watched seasons one and two, and then had to catch up with this season so I can pick it up on TV, and not miss anything.  I love the time period.  Such a different time with different sensibilities.  I am enjoying the differences between the upstairs lives and downstairs lives, and it's been an interesting take on how the downstairs jockies for position, and how underhanded they can be.  I hated to see Sybil die in childbirth, and for those who haven't read any outside information on the series, I won't spill the beans on another change I am not happy will happen.  I'm really enjoying this series!
B009LGO88E|3.0|The circle pad pro is great but I was really disappointed when I have received it. The pack age was open and then when I took the pad out the box was destroyed and the pad pro was out if its box. I'm happy that it works but angry on how little care they did to protect it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I tend to be addicted to Jewel games! This is yet another to feed my need for bling-bling!  Hours and hours!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|This book kept my attention to the very end.  Will your actions come back to revisit you or maybe better.
B0097GTUCC|5.0|Original & fresh first outing featuring established musicians as Mike McCready & Duff McKagan. Dark & evocative, it tells stories of seduction, lust, and regret. If you're a fan of Grunge, buy it!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I consider the Rolling Stones to be the best rock & roll band on the planet.  Do I like all their stuff?  No.  But I do love most of their stuff, especially the early Stones.  This is a great collection for those who grew up listening to the anti-Beatles.  They just keep on rockin'.
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|Long time Tegan/Sara fan here, so I'm not one to be converted.  Not sure what the hoopla is regarding the alleged change in sound/songwriting, cuz this is more of the same Tegan and Sara greatness, but with a smoother production and fuller sound.  Same ladies, same talent, same great songwriting, same awesome harmonies.  Any long time fan like me should dig this release.  New fans will be happy to encounter an entire catalog of material that is perhaps better than this release and just like that, they'll be a lifelong fan.
B003VBNN7C|4.0|I liked it and would watch it again.  John Goodman was great in this movie.  Kind of predictable though, but overall good movie.
B0084I9QIW|3.0|She had a sudden interest for some reason in this cd.  She enjoyed it.  She is 15 and is too young to have seen his dancing in his time.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|Great album from a band that should be more well known than they currently are. They put on an amazing live show as well.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|A true modern classic, and an absolute &#34;must see&#34;, one of those movies where every scene is an instant quotable
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It was okay, but never  overly stimulating. An easy, quick read if that's what you are looking for in a book.
B005GIS1SY|4.0|As anticipated. Some funny parts, voices, antics etc. I would recommend to all my friends who have small children. Thanks,
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was awesome better than I expected ... . . . . I can't think of any more words to say
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great way to catch up on my show! I've moved and havent set up my cable yet... So I can keep uip with my shows at a cheap price and not miss a thing! I love that the price is fair and the quality is great. I does buffer a little but not enough to hinder my enjoyment!
0553801473|4.0|He doesn't want to finish the story!  I mean dear lord is this another Wheel of Time series?  The first three books were fantastic, the fourth was a \\"huh?  did I just read that and get nowhere, but I still liked it?\\", and this book is more of the fourth but I feel like I've gotten somewhere with it.<br /><br />Also George, stop killing off your characters.  I won't say who gets it, though I'm sure people know by now, but killing off characters that people have invested time in, and often, becomes a non event.  Yeah, it was a shock in the first few books, but now my feeling when he off's someone is \\"meh, yeah I could see that coming a mile away and whatever.\\"<br /><br />Anyways, I liked the book and am looking forward to the next one.  I just wish he would wrap things up.  I mean, what is it with fantasy writers that don't want to finish their stories?  Robert Jordan died before he finished his story....Martin, don't you die be for you finish yours!!!!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|If you like Star Trek this collection is great and quality of picture is wonderful.  The originals have more humor than the Next Generation collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This was a pretty good book. It was a quick read. I wouldn't mind reading more books by her; however, it could have had more description. I am glad I bought it. It had some unexpected turns that made it more interesting!!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I thought I'd try this book since I loved the Harry Potter series.  JK Rowling didn't disappoint with a huge array of characters and sub-plots.  If she writes another book, I'll give it a read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed this book a lot. Easy read. Crazy story. Still undecided about the ending. Read this for a book club. Looking forward to the discussion.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is my fav game it is better then 1 I'm not stooping u not to get 1.I still like 1is better ( get it @ the free side on the app store.) trust me u will love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I cannot wait to play this game. I love horses and now I can have one. I am waiting for it to download now.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|She's excellent in this movie.  I love her in everything she does.  This is also a really great story about love and coming of age.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|My wife, Donna, cannot get enough of Ken Follett's books and this one is no exception.  She highly recommends that everyone read Winter of the World: Book Two of the Century Trilogy after they read Book One.
B002SRQ214|4.0|I purchased this as a gift to my daughter. She is currently putting her computer together and plans on having it complete by next week.
1612930425|4.0|I have wanted to read the book since I like the film version so much, the book always gives you more insight into the characters
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I can't find anything to complain about with this app; it is easy to use and very useful. a perfect calculator.
0316227706|5.0|The photographer, Seth Casteel, specializes as a pet photographer in LA and Chicago. His reputation rests upon this sub-specialization, pun intended, Underwater Dogs. It is his first book and is highly successful. Dogs, humor and great photos make it a winner reminiscent of Wegman's innovations.<br /><br />He understands dogs and their wildly expressive enthusiasm for chasing balls and fearless water play. This is physical humor with a heart. You get to see it all so clearly because he also demonstrates the skills and knowledge to light his moving subjects under water and what a particular lens' focal length matched with the right point of view can capture what matters the most in a fraction of a second. He distills that one moment out of the many in each dive. He has convinced both natural breeds and unusual breeds to \\"go for it\\". Fun meets trust. Thankfully, he also is skilled in how to control tone, color, contrast and depth of field masterfully to complement the composition and intentional distortion of the subject. He solves complicated problems and has a good eye.<br /><br />However, in general, this is not an entirely new creative genre. The more established William Wegman is the undisputed pioneer and creative master of humor, gesture and novelty photography using dogs. Consequently, there is already an existing market for anything adorable and humorous with dogs that steps beyond dogs posed for simple calendar shots. Casteel's version has a Wegman in space effect. The pool provides a way for the dogs to defy gravity while still allowing natural distortions created by water resistance from the force of the dive. The result pulls and parts various flaps and folds of the dogs' faces. This allows for the unexpected and highly expressive to surprise us and to distinguish each dive from the others. Casteel, like Wegman, understands the crux is the power of gesture, and that the unexpected or unusual sells. I think Casteel has far better craft than Wegman, although Wegman does not rely upon matters of craft. But Casteel is absolutely dependent upon it and thankfully for us, has complete control over everything except the magic born in the singular moment itself. Casteel is not trying to be Wegman, does make elaborate set-ups, props or wardrobe, and instead has carved out his own \\"underwater dog guy\\" identity quite well. Both photographers succeed wonderfully for their own reasons.<br /><br />Since Casteel is also partly based in Chicago I am hoping for my own reasons he might figure out a way to do a book that relates to our city. Maybe shots of dogs diving through ice fishing holes on Lake Michigan can contrast with southern Californian pools. They might chase loaded Bowser Dogs instead of balls.<br /><br />I have given this book as a gift to several friends with happy results. It also happens to be well printed for a very modest price. I think it is a steal.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|These birds and pigs won my heart from the very beginning- nevermind that I am trying my hardest to kill them off! The graphics and the sound effects for this game are genius, accounting for it's huge popularity with young and old alike!
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I have a nostromo game pad but i wasnt happy with it, the buttons were sticking and some buttons seemed to click on their own so i got the logitech G13 to see if it was better.<br />The simple answer is YES, the G13 is so much better, the buttons feel more smooth and are easier to press.<br />There are more buttons and they are arranged better, i saw reviews saying that some were hard to get to but i have not found that to be the case, actually i find them easier to reach than the nostromo.<br />I have had no issues with hand or wrist strain using the G13.<br />The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is because the initial set up took me a bit to figure out and there is little or no help in the box. This was fixed with a simple search on youtube.<br />In my humble opinion the G13 is a much better machine than the Nostromo.<br />Happy gaming.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This final book in the trillogy posed a bit of a challenge to me in staying engaged with the plot. I became mired at points in the story and just was not invested in the characters as I had been in the previous books. My sister in law commented to me that she did not even finish reading this one.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this boook is amazing it should win a newberry award ten times over !!!!YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK I BEG YOU TO READ IT
B009O2XY12|4.0|This colorful and cuddly game is not just for kids. The appealing graphics and the sound effects are endearing and induce you to heriocs to save these precious babies! There is enough challenge mixed with whimsey in this game to hold ones interest for a relaxing interlude of gaming.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|I can count the number of my living heroes on one hand while holding a cigarette.<br /><br />Ian's one of them.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The variety of interesting layouts continue to delight and surprise. The music is quite soothing and almost hypnotic making for a stress releasing experience. The scoring is done in a clever and graphic way that is user friendly. Overall this is a great game and I can recommend it to anyone who needs to unwind and de-stress.
B0000042GM|5.0|This an outstanding collection by a lover of Brahms. The sound is weak on a number of tracs but the presentation is wonderful.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is a romp! The graphics are attractive and colorful and the sound effects are entertaining and humorous. I gain quite a bit of satisfaction and anger management from slashing and splashing these fruits. I also find the challenge to beat my best score quite compelling! This game is easy to use and so much fun, appealing to a wide audience.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|My husband and I love this app!  I use it to drown out his snoring, and he chooses the &quot;white noise&quot; of the night!  Definitely a plus to a happy marriage!  Also love that you can add sounds after download!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You can jump on trains.Fly on power lines!Even juke police!It is so much fun I can not stop playing!BAM So cool
B003TH14H4|5.0|Love this show!!  Accidentally deleted my one episode and was happy that Amazon came to the rescue with their video purchase and watch option.  Now, that's not the correct name for this service but that's what it does.  For a slight charge, you can pick and choose fave episodes or entire show(s) and within minutes, you can tuck in, pass the popcorn and enjoy the show!  Castle, Beckett, Ammy...you are my Valentines!  Psst...Ammy, sell Castle some exercise equipment.  He's getting a little doughy around the edges.  lol
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Hated that I finished, so very interesting and tragic.  Wondered why so many bombers were sent in with no protection.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|I really like Michael Connelly and I think you'll enjoy this book too.  I wish there were more stories.  Some were just ok and others were really good.
B006CUZ7FA|5.0|She is currently on the third book.  She get's to watch the movie after she has read the book! Great series.
B00683JK9K|2.0|I love puzzles and when I started one I though this is great until I tried to move one around and I couldn't get it to move in a rotation motion and either could my husband, we went to instructions and did what they said and it just didn't work!  I deleted this app, who needs that!
014103579X|5.0|I have read this book over and over again since the first time I read it in the 1970s.<br /> John Berger blew everyone's mind in those days with this book. It helps you to analyze art from a completely different critical perspective. For example, the way in which painters treat female models, as reflections of the status of the men who commission the portraits, or as simple sex objects, on display.<br /> This demystification of art, along with Tom Wolfe's classic, The Painted Word, will help you to develop a smart way to look at art, or Ways of Seeing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! The horse is so real and the animation is so good that I feel like I actually own a horse. I definitely recommend this app!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Have recently heard, and become a huge fan of Beth Hart....incredible voice!! As for Joe Bonamassa, need I say more? The two of them have put together this wonderful album, that I just can't stop listening to. A great marriage of music!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book (Fifty Shades of Grey, Book 1) unrelenting in sex and pain.  I didn't find the plot interesting and so I felt no need to read it.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I'm not sure why they do this, but this five disc set has it all -- BluRay movie, Blue Ray extras, DVD movie, DVD extras, and digital format. Good set to have if you have kids who watch things over and over and over -- even if you scratch one, you've got a back-up.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was my first John Grisham book. The Racketeer.  Now I would like to read all of them.  He had me liking the main character, then briefly hating him and finally admiring him. Will recommend this book to my husband and others.
B009193OCM|4.0|I was planning a day trip to New York City, and obviously the Lonely Planet guide has a lot of things to do. My only issue is that the biggest, most famous things to do (the kinds of things you see if you have only one day) are covered about as well in free sources.<br /><br />Maybe I should have thought about that beforehand, but if you're like me and just want one day's worth of stuff to do, check out the free guides before this one.
B000AU9UYM|3.0|Really enjoyed the movie but being brand new out of the package the dvd should not skip the audio!!! The movie itself is one that will want to be owned by many.
B008KW43TE|5.0|I'm a middle aged white guy and this is a GREAT album.  I cannot believe how much I like it-- and even the non-songs really make the album.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This movie was amazing and just like the book. I laughed and cried. I will recommend this to all my friends and family.
B0043RSE2M|4.0|Not perfect but pretty good.  3d seems just average but maybe it is me-- never seems the same as at the theater.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am totally adicted to this game.<br />I like this even better then the first one.  my whole family loves this game.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|With the movie's title Skyfall, one might anticipate grand action and events that matter on a global scale. The movie makers instead have decided to go for a more \\"personal\\" touch for the events.<br /><br />Without any spoilers, that is not bad at all, I'm just missing the link to the figure Daniel Craig played in the movies before, where he used to be a tough guy who hardly showed any emotion. And I'm missing the reinvention of the \\"atomic bomb\\" or \\"laser\\" of previous Bond movies which added meaning on a global scale.<br /><br />Apart from that, this is a entertaining movie with some bright moments, especially during the intro and the long, interesting and impressive ending. Between that, we meet some surprising characters and follow standard action, nothing more. Therefore, for me, it probably surpasses \\"Quantum of Solace\\" in quality, but certainly not \\"Casino Royale\\".
0307592731|4.0|This book was required reading for my book club, or I would not have read it, because I'm generally tired of books about women who struggle and then come out on top (have read so many of them!). The woman who recommended it even apologized that it was an Oprah book. However, as a memoir, following Cheryl through her adventures both in life and  on the trail was interesting and had a good plot, even for a long, and seemingly lonely hike! I admire her  for being so willing to share some of her less-than-proud moments in her life (i.e., doing heroin) and such, and so the book is very personal and such, very endearing.  Her writing style is easy to read, has good descriptions, and gives a good feel for what it must have really been like. I admire this woman, and am so glad she made it back, alive and better for the journey!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|A movie worth waiting for.I couldn't imagine this movie being more perfect for comic fans or anyone who enjoys action movies.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|not a Zombie fan but this book was so well written that I was immediately drawn in.  It told the human story of a world wide pandemic.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Any fan of batman must have this in there collection.this movie,in my opinion,will be the one movie you can call an instant classic.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Generally speaking I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan but I did not think this was his best.  The story was very predictable.  The twist at the end about Joe was too far out there to be at all believable.  I don't think I would pay to see the movie.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|As good or better than I remembered.  Cast, acting, story, direction...all simply superb.<br /> One of the best (mostly) realistic thrillers of the last few decades. Perhaps even superior to the  original Benchley novel.<br />  A gem.
1439102813|5.0|This book takes all the big scary clinical words used to describe dementia and Alzheimer's and puts them in the frame of a real world person.  Telling the story from the patient's perspective is brilliant and so helpful for anyone trying to understand what is happening to a loved one with this disease.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|bought this for an 11 yr old for his birthday.  Somebody in the house picks it up about once a month.  The thing is too darn hard.  You cant experience enough success to keep you motivated for the challenge.  We should have started with the first one.  Epic is a bit too much for us.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love that the case turns off my kindle when I close it and turns it on when I open it.  Best of all it's more reasonable priced than several others I looked at.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy this game. No problems easy to understand and follow request. Very additive. I give this game five stars.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book is good I actually watched the show before reading this. In this book you realize that people aren't perfect and make bad decisions but sometimes that happens.To parents of children of a younger child a fair warning this book has swearing in it and it's probably a good idea to steer clear of this book. but I really enjoyed reading this book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Easy read-good story line. Looking forward to seeing the movie. I recommend middle school and up to read this book.
184448551X|3.0|As guides go it doesn't have much useful instruction in actually accomplishing the stitch patterns pictured in the book.  More of a pattern book than a guide.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game! it teaches u how to take care of a real horse. its 3-d and that makes it cool. i will never get rid of this app i love it so much. GET THIS GAME.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a book.  I was extremely glad that Elena got what was coming to her and that Christian and Anastasia are engaged.  Of course you knew Jack was going to take revenge.  Can't wait to read the last book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had been curious about this book for awhile.  I have to say I enjoyed it, but was also a bit disappointed that it wasn't as  &#34;racy&#34; as I though.  Can't wait to read the second book.  Don't like Elena.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I enjoyed the movie a lot and was happy to get a recording of the film sound track.  I just wish they had included more music on the disk such as the orchestral credits music.
B000065TWQ|2.0|The video was scratchy and wouldnt realy play so after the expense<br />and the expectation I have been unable to watch it.Very disappointed.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|A friend of mine who teaches tomorrow's teachers recommended this book to me after I was nearly overwhelmed by \\"Far From the Tree.\\"  He uses this excellent book for the young/young adult market in his class about teaching exceptional children.<br /><br />Clearly, the book requires a precocious central character who is self-aware and intelligent but still a child going into fifth grade.  Palacio captures an authentic voice for most of the primary and secondary characters, and the chapters told from perspectives other than Augie's give us a more complete picture of Augie and the challenges he faces, including the essential problem of being the new kid in school.  It's important that even the children closest to Augie don't always react or think positively about being his sibling/friend.<br /><br />I know a book like this has to build up to a positive climax, but the reader can see this one coming from a long way off.  The head master's speech at graduation is boring (Another facet of verisimilitude by the author) and the conclusion of the award ceremony seems more screen play than consistent with the rest of the book.<br /><br />But I quibble from the position of an adult reader, not the target audience for this book.<br /><br />A good read for grown-ups, a great read for youth/young adults.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was cool  how did Greg get the chicken pops did Greg's best friend have chicken pops this is my favorite book
1451695195|5.0|I couldn't put it down after I started it.<br />Anyone who is a non-believer in heaven, or the afterlife should read this book.  It mixes science and reality, providing the reader with un-denialable evidence that there is an afterlife.<br />You have to read it to believe it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is one of my first downloads. It was easy to download and set up. It loads quickly. I enjoy having it on my Kindle Fire. I would recommend it to everyone.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I have always loved Matt Damon in these movies.  Really love the quality of the pictures and the extras that are on the Blu-Ray.
B000006YO2|5.0|All my favorite songs included. (which is seldom the case in most &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; CD's).<br /><br />This is a CD best listened to with your favorite woman. I tell my wife that Bryan Ferry is<br />a &#34;Crooner&#34;, not a singer.
B0073PZIYI|4.0|I enjoyed the plot, although I didn't like the ending and I wouldn't buy it on DVD or Blu-ray. Not sure if I will ever see it again.
B006H5120E|5.0|I liked it in 2d now on 3d it stands out very good movie you can see it and kinda feel like been in the titanic.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I'm glad this came with a digital copy as well, the graphics and imagery are great. Glad I got it.
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio allows me to listen to Coast to Coast AM before dark o'clock. The signal is clear, too -- something I can't say for my local station.  I have my pick of stations to choose from.  I recommend it highly.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I love this and can't wait til part 2 comes out on here. Although a series set would definitely get my money.
B009MF5BXK|3.0|Having all the other action figures in it was amusing but this story I found was heavy on blood spray and a bit light on a predictable plot.  It was ok, I guess but this was also from hubby who was the one who wanted to see the movie in the first place.  He was disappointed - I think the first one was better.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I have a dark feeling about the whole harry potter series, but I still like it.  I just don't think I will be watching it as much.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Two minutes to learn.  The kids love the whole eating brains theme.  Good Fun for the whole family.  mmmmmm.. BRAAAAAIIINS!
B004QYTRRS|5.0|I love this so much I had to buy it, I love the misdirection and everything, watch it over and over and I still love it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best series I have ever watched. Masterfully produced, superbly acted and overall very entertaining. Can't wait for season 4.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Love this movie and Had a great time watching it with my family.  My children watch it again and again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice game, even if you are a grown-up like me, you can fullfill a childhoods dream: a horse, that belongs to you.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love this, I put the digital movie on my iPod and laptop. The other disc allow my whole family to watch on the computer, dvd and blu ray whenever they want.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|What an amazing and beautiful portrayal of a 5 year old's reality. So clever and  wonderfully written. This is a must read
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I have all the Transformer movies now, I would have been nice if they sold them in a set but I will take what I can get
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app!! sooo much. I do wish gems were easier to get though. but otherwise my horse is such a fun game! !!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This completes my set, I have all the harry potters now. I can have a harry potter marathon any time I want.
B001AITGWE|4.0|It is not a classic or an award winning movie, but it has plenty of scenes you will remember frequently, including some situations you will face in life and will want to react just like the main character does in the movie. Like when he is not served breakfast in a fast-food store because he get there two minutes past the breakfast time.  Great entertainment, with the usual great performance of Robert Duval. A good Hollywood flic
1400069289|5.0|Love this book!!! Very practice, interesting , easy to read. I recommend this book for everybody, it's help open your eyes and think clearer

B00123IATW|5.0|Like Yes &#34;Fragile&#34; this album was worth the upgrade.  One of those albums where high fidelity really matters.  Even though I have have a vinyl version in great condition the recording to mp3 could not come close to this remastered version.  It was worth the repurchase.
B0079J28NW|5.0|I had the Yellow Submarine DVD and this BLU RAY is a major improvement in both picture and sound. The only reason why I watched the original DVD was to listen to the 5.1 surround sound mix,which was good. But on this Blu Ray the sound is dramatically improved and the surround sound mixes of the songs are amazing. Even a weak song like Northern Song becomes a joy to listen to in surround sound. You don't have to fast forward to get to the songs, you can select each song individually in the scene menu. You also have the choice of listening to the film in it's original mono. I'm not a fan of animated films, but this is a nice film for children, or adults who like animated films. When it came out it was ahead of its time. But for a big time Beatles fan  like myself, this is well worth having just to listen to the songs. The only Beatles recording that compares is the Beatles Love DVD Audio disc. The songs that are on this Blu Ray are, in my opinion, the best sounding Beatles tunes you can hear in terms of audio quality, with the possible exception of Beatles Love DVD Audio.
B0012QK8OE|5.0|One of those albums where high fidelity really matters.  Even though I have have a vinyl version in great condition the recording to mp3 could not come close to this remastered version.  It was worth the repurchase.  Sometimes they get you.  With the remastered version of The Beatles collection, I now have 3 full copies of their entire catalog; it's painful but they know how to get your hard earned $$ and in certain circumstances it is worth the price to purchase the upgrade.
B00A80SHFM|2.0|I love this musical, movie, etc, but was vastly disappointed with the fact the actual soundtrack was missing some of the most important songs, especially &#34;A little fall of rain&#34;.  That is one of my favorite songs from the musical and was so disappointed it wasn't on the soundtrack that I could only give them 2 stars.
0316236535|5.0|All of my children love this book.  We read it over and over and then they all want to take turns reading it too.  Such a fun story!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is an awesome app. If u look at when it is updated,it is every minute. Do not hesitate to buy.  GET IT is free and has videos.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Every song song on this CD is an absolute winner!!!  Paul Simon is a genius!!!  Had brought this CD many years ago, but lost it and after watching a special about the making of Graceland, I had to have it again.
030758836X|4.0|A page turner, with scenarios and personal insights that anyone can relate to. And, just a very good diversionary read.
B009AMALGM|2.0|I own the first three movies and eagerly awaited the fourth installment.  As the title says, I was disappointed.  If you've seen the previews you know this is a sequel to # 2 and follows Hunter and Katie.  From there the similarities to the other movies seem to stop.  The evil being is no longer the invisible force, but seems to be a shadow that moves around the room - a huge disappointment for me as I hate it when movies feel they need to reveal the creature/unknown being/demon.  Some of the suspense comes from not knowing what it is.  Second, throughout the movie I constantly wondered which little boy was Hunter.  Is it Robbie or is it Wyatt?  Once you think you have it figured out they change it again.  Which brings my next questions - if it isn't Robbie, who is Robbie?  Where did he come from?  If it's Wyatt, how did Hunter get adopted by another family?  Lastly, I feel the other three movies had a suspenseful build up, where the events increased in magnitude, to the climax of the movie - this one didn't seem to have that.  Just a series of small, random make you jump moments until - BANG!  People are dying!  All-in-all, the weakest of the four movies.  We won't be buying this one and if the series continues I probably will not watch them.
B000HAB4KS|4.0|I like the movie due to the special effects and the story behind the Matrix.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action/drama.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a very heart felt book.  I don't know much about cancer and it really opened my eyes to the awfullness it puts your body through.  I wouldn't reccomend reading this book if you are already feeling sad, but it is a good read.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|I downloaded the fulll version to play like my friend who has the iphone version of this app, however it looks like the android version hasn't been updated in ages! Getsu's cart and the power ups are not available, starfruit isn't granted (nor shows up), and the newer blades and backgrounds to unlock are not even available. You pay the exact same price for less content, which is a complete ripoff. UPDATE THIS APP!
B00AJV4G28|5.0|Buddy Guy live at his Legends club in Chicago.  Great show, by one of the best guitar players that ever lived.
B0079J28NC|3.0|I guess when you're a kid, you'll watch darn near anything, as long as it's something that appeals to your 'kid' brain. Yellow Submarine fits that bill nicely, with lots of pretty colors, silly jokes and a good-vs-evil storyline. But as an adult, you need something more. Yellow Submarine certainly stands in a class by itself as an animated curiosity. I had not seen this movie since I was 10 or 12, and quite honestly, it was a lot tougher this time around. While the funny, flashing fish with human faces and the bright neon colors that could have been ripped from a deadbeat hippie's tie-dyed t-shirt might have been fun for a child, as an adult, it just comes off as a 90-minute assault on the optic nerves. The constantly changing colors and eerie geometric patterns are a guaranteed way to jump-start a headache. It was great to hear the Fab 4 sing their hearts out, especially on \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\", 2 of my favorite Beatles songs. But the irritating, garish colors, the clash of psychedelia meets pop art, just drags on for far too long. I kept thinking, \\"Boy, they must have had some AWESOME drugs in the 60's!\\" It comes as no surprise that the song 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' (LSD) is included in the movie. And you have to wonder about the head Blue Meanie, and the fact that he's wearing what looks suspiciously like a Mouseketeer's hat. Is that just coincidence, a sly insult to Disney, or a tip of the hat to one of animation's undisputed masters?<br /><br />As a good litmus test for your patience, you might consider the fact that one of the key people involved in the production was none other than Al Brodax,  responsible for some of the worst episodes ever in the Popeye cartoon franchise (1960-1962).<br /><br />The restoration of this odd film was nothing short of immaculate, although the speaking voices of Fred and the Beatles sounds muddled compared to the music. I was constantly 'throttling down' the volume on the musical numbers. Honestly, this movie never looked better than it has on this DVD. But it's one of those films that, once you've seen it, you're good for another 15 or 20 years. It will take you that long to recover from the last viewing.s movie never looked better than it has on this DVD.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely amazing!  Best book I've read in a while.  Please charge more for these books....I'll pay ANYTHING!!!  Well, anything up to about $12.99 :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am hooked and wish the 3rd season on Amazon was not finished.<br />Can't wait to watch the next episode when it is put out.
1451627289|5.0|As many of King's novels & stories, this one jumps right in, grabs hold & just keeps going.  No matter if you're a die hard King fan as I am or just an avid reader, this book is an amazing read.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|But  very simple and wish it had a little more story to it.<br />I enjoyed playing with it. The kids were quite interested too.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|So easy to use even my 11 year old daughter adds events in that she wants me to remember.  I have my monthly work schedule appointments for the whole family saved I can say it's the best calendar system I've used ever.  You can set the reminders up how you want you can create weekly,biweekly,daily repeat appointments very user friendly and the color and icon options are awesome!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Suspenseful, dramatic, could have included a bit more action by the main character. It did keep me reading. However thought the endiing left a little to be desired.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was amazing and interesting. had a lot of twists and turns.I loved the cool twist you did with Rowley
B00AMBH70S|4.0|When a main actor ducks out of a series that is usually the death of that series.  I am happy to say this is an exception. Jeremy Renner was a fantastic replacement.<br />Since this is the fourth installment - I was also afraid the plot would get old.  NOT AT ALL.....The writers found a way to tell basically the same story in a very entertaining, action filled movie.<br />I highly recommend this movie.  One of the best action films I have seen in a while.  Very entertaining and you will not miss Matt Damon.  Renner is a fantastic replacement.
B003BWERF8|5.0|I use this with my Ipod Shuffle 6th Gen, that has a watch attachment. So i wear around my wrist and it always stays in. The battery stays on for a good few hours, doesn't drain it too much. Quality still sounds good. It pairs Great with the LG HBS-700 Bluetooth headset, and Jambox. My only thing is it is so small, i have thought i lost it twice now. Keep the Plastic box it comes in and ALWAYS put it back in after you have used it. you will find it stays around alot longer... anyways Great Buy!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I bought a blue ray player/recorder for my computer. Once I got the right player the disk played like a movie house.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Claire Danes does an outstanding job of capturing the heart and soul of an individual and her unique and exciting story.  You'll fall in love with the courage, stamina and fortitude of Temple Grandin and those who lovingly supported, encouraged and guided her on her journey starting with her mother.<br />If you're looking for a story of hope, faith and love this one wraps up those elements and presents them in a timeless package.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Awesome... can't wait for the next book in this great story. I hope it takes many more to complete the tale..
1594487154|5.0|I've read Daniels book Drive and thought it was very well researched, reasoned and presented in a memorable and simple format.  So when I saw this title and read the reviews I knew it would be on my reading list for 2013.  It was worth every minute and then some.  Pink understands how to take an &#34;old subject&#34; and make it new again.  Great stories (including the Fuller Brush man), memorable formulas (new A, B, C's of selling) and research that is changing the paradigm of the worlds oldest and most honorable profession, selling.<br />If you're looking for a fresh and enlightening presentation of a subject that impacts each and all of us every day, this book will be a page turner for you.  Get it, read it, review it, digest it and smile.  What a mental meal! Thanks Daniel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my 4 yr. old love horses, so this is Perfect for her!  Some game play does require parental help with the reading, but otherwise she can play by herself. its great for learning how to care for a pet.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Love the show & cannot go wrong w/blue-ray. Has really great special features, in case you need more. ;) Highly recommend.

B0083EY9EI|5.0|Emeli Sande has an amazing voice and the music on this album is great! I would recommend checking out her work if you have not already!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|it's the freaking walking dead! what more SHOULD I say!? I can't really review the episode because that would spoil it for those of you who for some reason haven't seen it yet, but the whole show is something you have to watch.
B004U8VUUC|4.0|I bought this movie to watch on the airplane and it kept my interest for the whole flight.  Excellent performances.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I can't get enough of this show. It's witty, informative, hilarious, and flat out fun to watch. The evolution of the characters was fun to watch, and by the 3rd season they have really settled on who these characters are. You will enjoy this show.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I started my pinterest about a month and a half ago, and what started as casual interest has turned into a daily thing. its a fun way to find out more about friends through their interests while sharing what I like too. its also a great way to save stuff I find on the Internet to check out later. whoever came up with pinterest is a genius!
B0058BI896|5.0|The Big Bang Theory never disappoints. Four years running and still as entertaining as ever... This is a no-limit concept for a TV show, so it could go on for ever, and we can only hope. It's funny, witty, and draws you in as a viewer. All you can ask for in a TV show.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This 3 disc set has lots of extras to pique the interest and explain the &#34;how-to's&#34; of making the movie.  Fascinating stuff.  It has all the extra deleted scenes and just tons of fun stuff to go along with the movie which enhances the viewing pleasure.  Thanks...I will continue to watch all 3 discs over and over.
B002P79KAC|5.0|This show is hilarious, original, and always fun to re-watch. Online access is simple and convenient. There it is. Nuff Said  :)
B007FDE4Y8|3.0|This SteadyVid Pro works, but wasn't worth what it was hyped up to be.. I can almost hold a t2i better than this.. ALMOST is the keyword.. Takes a bit to adjusting and once you do.. it works fine.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is my favorite show and will continue to buy them as they come. I think its a must watch for teenage girls!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|If you are like me you love so called white noise or environmental sounds to aid in reminiscences. I already have collections in my CD library. But this particular set of sounds includes &#34;rain drops on a car roof&#34;.  I'm a fanatic when it comes to the sound of the pitter patter of rain.  I've been known to go sit in my car parked on my driveway just so I can hear the soothing sound. How bout the click clack of a railroad car... That takes me back to the 1940's when I would sleep on the rao; rode from the bay area to Long Beach and my grandparents. I was under eight years of age.  That click clack still puts me in a comfort zone reminiscent of those times.  Hey, this app was free. How can you beat that!
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Excellent.  Took little time to learn.  I never read directions.  I use it every day works well for me.  Thanks
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Great book, exactly what I expected, it was affordable, no problems to read it on my tablet. Ill be the next book in an electronic format too.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Thought -provoking, engaging, page turner book. My daughter in 6th grade got it as a requirement and I had time to read it, too.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I blast this CD on my way to work this morning. I teach in Detroit. I met Jack White when he was in Goober and the Peas. I teach right near where he grew up and I am a Detroit Rock music person. This CD makes you sing very loud!!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I loved this book and could not put it down. The characters were genuine and<br />believable.  It was very sad at the end and I had a good cry.
B0015KO52S|5.0|I am a huge Jack White fan and this CD does not let you down at all! You will be singing very loud to this one!!
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Argo was a wonderful movie to watch.It was the best movie that I have watched in a longer.I would highly recommend Argo.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters are intriguing and engaging. The writers make the ever-changing plot grab and hold your interest. I always want more!
B006H5120E|5.0|It was wonderful watching The Titanic  in 3D.If you haven't seen the Titanic in 3D, you are really missing a great experience The movie was really great..
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like to do seek and find puzzles so this works for me.  I am not forced to buy everything but it takes patience this way because you are very limited on how long you can play until you'd have to buy more energy or wait. I just wait. I also don't like to post or play with friends so am not using it completely but that's all right by me.
1603427244|5.0|This is a handy little book. It's small enough to keep in your knitting bag and a great resource book to keep close by. There's even tips on &#34;Getting It Right&#34; that further simplifies the already very clear instructions. Also, it's coil bound so you don't need a paper weight to keep it open and the pages are thick and glossy. There are cast ons and bind offs for every imaginable pattern in here.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|the characters are continuing to grow (at least the ones that have survived) but the energy is still building as i'm only a few hundred pages in.
0061478784|3.0|I have fond memories of the Chrestomanchi series, so I decided to give this series a try. It has been over 10 years since I read the Chrestomanchi series and I remember a very exciting, well-written, and creative story. This story was creative, perhaps a bit exciting....and it could have been told slightly better. You think that if something bad happened to you that completely changed you, you would be up in arms 24/7. Sophie the heroine of the story is sometimes and isn't others; I found that a bit hard to relate too. The other characters are a bit mysterious and we don't seem to develop strong feelings for them. However, the way the story turns out is really good...it kind of happens fast though and is pretty unexpected/expected. at times. I wish the ending had been smooth out into 10 more pages....it would have been more clear then. I haven't seen the movie, so I am not coming from that pov. I think the really big ending happens within 1 page of the book and it leaves you going ahh??? So I found that a bit frustrating (maybe that is all her stories, I don't know.)
B0083SBJXS|5.0|i can watch this over and over again for a long time..My best hero is the Hulk of course but I like the Thor is all powerful as well.
B003FOFJAY|5.0|I missed Gilmore Girls when it was running on TV.  I had so many friends recommend it, that I bought the first season and fell in love with the show.  So, I had to buy the entire show. The dialogue is great and anyone would fall in love with this cast and show.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Making sure your pictures are always fabulous is easy with this app! Blotting out blemishes is my favorite part. Love this!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute game, good graphics, but a little slow.  Wish you could earn diamonds faster in the game.  Overall good game for horse lovers.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I absolutely loved this game but I'm kind of irritated that I paid 2.99 for it and it wasn't even that long of a game. I wish there had been more for my money. So I wont be buying part 2 but all in all its a really fun and addictive game.
B00136NUG6|5.0|all hit songs.  i have the gratitude live lp and this is great because i can play it on my blutooth portable while im working.
B000JML7EC|5.0|When first published this was considered an exciting story of English pirates. Today it reads as an interesting insight into old English culture and an interesting sea tale. Worth the read if you are interested in fictional history
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Nice, easy to work with.  Nice features.  I definitely needed it and became exactly what I needed.  Some trouble getting back to home screen, other than that perfect.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Was so excited to play on a big screen but never worked!!!!! So very disappointed. Oh well deleting this app for now
B00136NVH4|5.0|Great music from my younger years.  Brings back many memories. Like a bat out of hell.  What more can be said.  LOL
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played so go get it now because you  will be crazy not to get right now!!!
B008I43DYU|5.0|Easy to use, large characters so it's easy to see.  Turn it sideways and it turns into a scientific calculator....

B004LROUNG|2.0|A very entertaining and masterly crafted tale. I always enjoy reading books by this author and this one stands out as one of his best. I recommend it to any reader of legal fiction.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Just think of the most awesome thing you've ever experienced, now take that x100 and you will know the awesomeness that is Subway! Surfers!
B005TD4GTO|5.0|Some really creative and poppy tracks. I saw some live footage of Noel doing a benefit concert for the hurricane (i think in Germany) as an opening act. I didn't know who Noel Gallagher was, maybe if I'd had, I would've changed the channel. I watched pleasantly surprised, moved, and impressed, wondering who these guys were, also observing that the huge crowd was going crazy. Live the songs were a lot more powerful, I wish I recorded it on dvr, it was a really good show- arguably the best performance of day from what I saw and there were some huge names on the bill. I kept on thinking about how much I loved the sound, luckily a few weeks later there was a replay and I searched Noel Gallagher- duh! Oasis. I bought the CD. I'd really like to see him live if ever in San Francisco!
0783229372|5.0|What excitement.  What adventure.  An amazing recreation.  George C. Scott played the part as the events  may have actually happened.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|The book was ok. The only difficulties I had was the way Vonnegut wrote this book. He practically went in circles. The only thing I would change to this book would be to make it more linear
B003M0H4NG|5.0|When I purchased this album based on its reputation as described on Wikipedia.org, I was not sure what to expect.  However, upon listening to the whole album, I was smiling happily in the end.  There were even moments when I laughed at the unexpected notes played in the album, realizing how complex and fantastic the music was.  It was music to my ears indeed.  I had to listen to it a couple more times because it was quite compelling.<br /><br />It is quite a masterpiece of creative complexity.  I highly recommend this album to those who want to hear something different.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it.. but sometimes it will be slow.my 11 year old brother loves this game, he is always playing subway surfer.
B00006JIA4|4.0|This item is an excellent collection for its price (< $20 at the time of purchase).  It includes a number of hits and popular works by Queen.  The remix and some collaborative works need not be included.  Otherwise, I'm fine with the selections, most of which were in my mental wish list.<br /><br />It might be, as another reviewer suggested, better to collect all their original albums and listen to them as they were intended to be.  This is actually true for a lot of other artists' works.
B002LFAHBO|3.0|It's a nice little Christmas movie, but I wouldn't rate it in the top 10 or 20 Christmas movies like so many web reviews do.  Some very suggestive themes - not one you'd want younger children to see.
B000002AGE|5.0|This is my first Weather Report CD/album which I found in a neighborhood record store.  I heard about this group and knew \\"Birdland\\" was one of their works.  I was happy to have bought this CD album.<br /><br />I have listened to this CD several times and it keeps getting better every time.  There's a good vibe with the way each member of the band come together in playing each track.  I believe they expressed themselves well in every track.<br /><br />Now that I have this album, I am going to check out their other works.  I just purchased [[ASIN:B007Y2W438 The Complete Columbia Albums 1971-1975]] in order to hear their musical evolution.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Quick blurd. I love the sound of Little Big Town and I have always loved Restless Heart. To me this is a combination of both. With the harmonies and the good production, how can you go wrong. Great Job!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|\\"No Easy Day,\\" is an autobiographical account of the authors journey to becoming a Navy Seal. The last third of the book describes the actual raid on Bin Laden's compound. To give the author credit, his book was written before the movie, \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" which provides a more dramatic account of the same information.<br /><br />The perspectives of the movie and the book are entirely different. The movie dramatizes the search for Bin Laden, the book describes the mundane, difficult, routine of becoming, and working as, a Seal. Owen tells us that the Bin Laden raid was really no different than the hundreds of operations these heroes perform on a weekly basis. Its a job. Its dangerous. There is masculine team like camaraderie amongst the soldiers. All this is interesting, and described in a no-nonsense voice by the author.<br /><br />What this book isn't: It's not a drama, but rather more of a documentary. It does not reveal any inside intelligence secrets. The author is a soldier, not a writer, and thus this is not an example of literature, it's a narrative.<br /><br />For those interested in the experience of a Seal, or wanting to add to their understanding of The Operation, this is good book. Much more interesting, and dramatic, is the ZD30 movie.

B005FUTBWS|3.0|Well acted with a well written story line, the entire movie is a bit too realistic  based on today's news and hottest topics. Well worth a watch for sure. The hate crazed 'pastor' and his lunatic followers will make you both angry and concerned about just how far this type of activity may be spreading and how will law enforcement and society deal with it.

B004MMEF30|5.0|I love mysteries and this is my favorite Sherlock Holmes story. The Baskerville family has been haunted for generations by a legendary hound of the moors.  The evil deeds of one of their ancestors (and their guilty feelings about his actions) brought this hound into their family history in the form of a curse.<br /><br />Sir Charles Baskerville, master of the estate has recently died, apparently of a heart attack. There's no reason to suspect foul play but the doctor investigating the death scene found the tracks of a gigantic hound near his body and speculates that with Sir Charles' bad heart, he may have been frightened to death.<br /><br />The estate now passes to next of kin, Sir Henry Baskerville and the question arises whether he will be safe from the ghost hound from Hell who haunts his family. And who would inherit the estate, if he should die? To add to the superstitious feelings, residents of Dartmoor have recently reported hearing the howling of a hound across the moors at night.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, Sherlock Holmes will be able to find a logical explanation for this mystery. But in maddening fashion, he refuses to travel to Baskerville hall, sending Dr. John Watson in his place.  Holmes will be investigating in his own ways but he keeps his plans secret. Watson soon finds himself walking the shadowy, dark and haunted moorlands of the Baskervilles where he will eventually come face to face with the beast of Dartmoor.<br /><br />Interestingly, this story may be loosely based upon a legend which does exist about a dark beast which prowls the land of Dartmoor. However, the Baskerville family and their family curse are entirely fictitious.
B001LM1456|4.0|I really like all of the Marvel movies and this one is good too; just not as good as Iron Man and Iron Man 2 or the Avengers. (=  If I would have known the picture quality wasn't very good without HD, I would have spent the dollar more on the rental from Amazon.  All in all, it's a good movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read. It involves excellent writing, plot and characters. The movie based upon this book is also well done but easier to understand if you first read the book.  Katniss Everdeen is a teenage girl in a post-Apocalyptic country of Panem--a land once called North America. She hunts and struggles to find food for her widowed mother, younger sister and herself. People are literally starving to death.<br /><br />Each year the oppressive government selects two tributes in a reaping (one boy and one girl between 12-18 years of age) from each of twelve districts to compete in the Hunger Games. Katniss lives in District 12, the poorest of poor. Most people with jobs work in Coal mines. Her father died in a mining accident.<br /><br />Much like the arena games of ancient Rome, the Hunger Game contestants must survive, fight and die until only one of them remains...the Victor of that year's games. Although most people live without any modern conveniences the government and people in the Capital city have excessive riches and the Hunger Games are broadcast live across the country on television where residents are \\"required\\" to watch them. In 74 years, District 12 has had a winner only twice and the only surviving victor is Haymitch Abernathy who will serve as coach for the current contestants from his district. He is an embittered man who spends much of his time drunk...not being able to cope with the guilt about his own Hunger Games, the grief of what happened to the people he loved and the fact he must coach and watch new tributes from his district die in the games every year.<br /><br />Katniss' sister Prim is 12 and it's her first year to have her name entered in the Tribute reaping.  As a first year entry, her name is only entered once so odds are against her being chosen. Nonetheless, she is chosen as the female tribute from District 12. Prim is innocent and fragile. Katniss loves her very much and is extremely protective of Prim, so she volunteers to take her place.<br /><br />Katniss finds herself preparing for and participating in the Hunger Games along with Peeta Mellark, the baker's son from her district who once took pity upon her by tossing her some cast-off bread.  Peeta has secretly had a crush on Katniss for years. He's very kind and likeable but Katniss mustn't allow herself to like him. To survive, she must be the last of 24 tributes left alive. Tragically, either Peeta or Katniss must die, if either tribute from District 12 is to survive.<br /><br />In addition to toughness, survival and fighting skills, the victor must also cultivate charmisma because the contestants are show-cased on live television before and during the games. Tributes who elicite sympathy from viewers may be sent \\"gifts\\" during the games such as food, water or medicine.  Katniss doesn't feel comfortable in the role but she has the help of people who cast her and Peeta as \\"star-crossed lovers\\" forced to compete against one another in the Hunger Games and also portray her as the Girl-On-Fire. She becomes very popular among the crowds...a fate which may help her survive this year's Hunger Games but also make her a threat to the very government. But that's a story for the sequels. For the rest of the story, also read: Catching Fire and Mockingjay.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyed the book from start to finish! Plenty of unexpected surprises and turns, loved the great John Grisham outside the courtroom.
B000FC12Z0|4.0|Murder on the Orient Express is one of the best and most famous of Agatha Christie's murder mysteries.  It involves the detective skills of Hercule Poirot who is traveling on the Orient Express train and stumbles upon a murder which seems quite impossible to solve. But of course he is brilliant and will piece together the jigsaw puzzle, even though many of the pieces don't seem to fit.  Read this story and all it's details carefully because it's got a twist ending you'll never be able to forget. So it's never quite as fun to re-read as it was the first time through.

B00447L4JG|5.0|my Halloween theam last year was this movie ! we built a theater and played the show and set up every thing around it for this day. We recieved and award for most fun and original house .

B000FBJAOG|3.0|Doesn't come close to being as good as World War Z, Max Brooks' zombie masterpiece.  That said, this is a decent read if you're looking for something different.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book (and the series in general) gets worse after the first book.  The books become more about a character that is unlikable at her core.  I can't relate to her, and often times find myself rooting against her in her personal life.  The little action that is in this book is repetitive and predictable.
B000002NJM|1.0|what can i say about a movie such as this exciting<br />gory at times music tracks are great i bought the cd straight away.<br />shared with friends.
B00AF6B22E|1.0|I rented this movie from RedBox last night.  Denzel Washington is an amazing actor (one of my favorites), and the movie trailer with the inverted plane absolutely caught my attention.  Of course at the beginning of the DVD there is the rating screen (Film is rated \\"R\\"), to which I noticed that this movie was going to contain some things of a questionable nature:  language, drugs, sexuality, and nudity.  In the movie Pelham 123, Denzel played the \\"good guy\\" - an amazing role, but John Travolta's use of the \\"F\\" word in every sentence killed the movie in my opinion.  Again in \\"Pelham,\\" I believe Denzel did an amazing job with his role of acting.  In the movie \\"Flight,\\" even though Denzel owns up to his addictions and his faults, attributing to a \\"righteous end\\" to the film - I still hold this movie at the bottom of the stack of what I've come to expect from Denzel.  If you're going to watch this movie hoping to see the Denzel from \\"Book of Eli,\\" \\"Remember the Titans,\\" \\"Man on Fire,\\" or \\"Safe House\\" - I think you'll be let down, as I was.  If you can navigate the language, darkside of drinking, glorification of drugs, etc. and hold the simple story-line... the movie has redemptive qualities.  Oh... and Christians \\"beware\\" - You're portrayed as borderline psychopaths and toga-wearing \\"fruit cups.\\"  Praise Jesus!!!

B0041OOJNU|5.0|This CD is awesome! It has helped me learn Spanish. It's fun to sing along with driving in the car.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book. Written well. Chris Kyle is truly an american hero. It's tragic that his life was taken in the manner it was. I've read many books about snipers and spec ops stuff, and this book rates near the top. Warning: once started, it's very difficult to put down. RIP Mr. Kyle.
0671449028|5.0|This is a typical Sandra Boynton book with cute pictures and a cute rhyme. We read it nightly I would recommend it to anyone.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great app. I even use it on my phone, you have options to color code your notes and add your list, when you are done, you can click to check them out, as you progress with it.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Definitely produced to be a 3d movie. Everything is over exaggerately, monsters, bullets, blood, flying towards the screen. The story line was an afterthought to the special effects.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|easy to use and functions exactly as a laptop or desktop.<br />I have nothing else to say about this. thanks
B00B7G23KQ|2.0|An old idea already. Try something different. Even the predictable was boring. They're tking the money and running<br /><br />save your money
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Yet another great album by Linkin Park. I like the changes in tempo and Castle of Glass is fast becoming one of my favorite songs from any artist.
B007LNJ4YW|2.0|Not really hearing what all the fuss was about. Nothing really compelling here I will give it another listen next time Im in the car for a road trip, but this albumn is fairly unimaginative and unispiring as a whole.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|I love this dvd. It has the guns n roses music videos. all of my favorites. live the high quality. can watch the band in their glory days. the best guns n roses dvd that i own. has the appetite for destruction album (for music videos). LOVE IT
B008NW67E0|4.0|Nice to hear well produced contemporary folk music that has univeral commercial appeal. Its a rare treat. Great albumn here, more than a handful of qualiry tracks.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I have no wish to over-analyze Anyd Weir's tale of survival in \\"The Martian.\\" If one shops for wine at the supermarket, the less expensive (cheap) items are placed on the floor level shelf. However, on ocassion, one finds a surprisingly good bottle at floor level prices. That's the case here...floor-level price for a very surprisingly good tale! Buy it. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I docked one star for typos and such - probably a result of using Amz.com's conversion program, which is notorious for not being as accurate as it should be. I use 'Booknook.biz' for all conversion needs. That said, I really enjoyed \\"The Martian\\" - real science, real situations, real person in Mark Watney.<br /><br />J. Carl Hudson, author, \\"LUNA\\"
B00ARN0WBW|3.0|The Paranormal series story line actually continues more plot & affects driven in the 4th installment. Unfortunately the jumpscares are too predictable not really by any fault of the filmamakers other than its the 4th movie in the series and the filmography is predictable as a result.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|As Season 3 had just begun and I had missed all of Season 2, I spent a really great day catching up.  Then spend a few more hours catching up on Season 3 on DVR.....I wish this series was more than once a week.
B005EHNMWM|3.0|Big Wilco fan feels let down. Track one shows a lot of promise for a new dimension of production for the band, but the rest of the albumn coasts on momentum of past success. I aint hatin though
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|it doesn't work at all and gives you a bunch of letters and numbers that aren't the passwords at all.
B00122MWU6|5.0|Great listen from start to finsh. Take this albumn for a jog or crank it at home if you have a chore that will take you a while. Great piece of work.
0061726834|4.0|In this dystopian future set in Maine, the government has found the source of almost all of society's conflict-love.  They've labeled it amor deliria nervosa, and seek to eradicate the condition .  Through scientific advancements, humans are able to be cured of the urge to find or desire love.<br /><br />A whole segment of banished or escaped citizens called Invalids supposedly live in the Wilds past the borders.  Lena, initially terrified of the outsiders, comes to be fascinated with them.  How can they possibly exist without having had the cure?<br /><br />A few months before her eighteenth birthday, Lena is looking forward to her \\"procedure\\".  All young adults in this future society are treated...cured from the trials and tribulations of love.  Young people are tested, analyzed, and matched with suitable life partners.<br /><br />Lena's mother's procedure didn't work, bringing shame on the entire family.  Considering her sordid family associations, Lena is eager to blend in with her rightful place in society.  That is, until she meets Alex.  This boy has hair the golden brown of leaves just beginning to turn in the autumn, and his eyes draw heat to Lena's skin.  What is this craziness she's feeling?  Suddenly, the thought of surgically removing all traces of love from her life does not sound as appealing.<br /><br />Follow Lena's final months before her procedure as she questions the entire set-up of her world. Will the surgery dull her whole existence?  Does she want to go through with, losing the new found feelings she's having?<br /><br />There are a few passages about Lena's undying love for Alex that made me skim.  I wish she would break up some of the longer chunks of texts.  I realize the whole point of this novel is the imposed separation of Lena and Alex and what they attempt to do to overcome it.  Yet, I wish the heroine had a bit more going on than her passion for Alex.  However, this is overall a great read.  You'll burn through it, and hope for a sequel.uel.
B0094KTAEY|3.0|Not a bad movie though. When I realized what happened I didnt contact customer service to get my moneyback. Looks good on my TV through my DVD player.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I've used this for many things , but after recently having a heart surgery I've found a new use - calculating my vitamin k intake on a daily basis.<br /> Wolfram alpha is far superior than the limited pamphlet information given at the Warfarin (AKA Coumadin) clinics.<br /> It's better and easier than looking up information from a sheet of paper or online too because the calculations are all done in the program. Want to know how much vitamin k is in 1/4 tbs of basil? Just ask it \\"vitamin k in 1/4 tbs basil\\".<br />It doesn't get any better.<br />5 stars and worth every one.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|I love this movie . Great story and twist . Awesome one liners, my girlfriend and I allways dropping them on each other. Great date movie for sure.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this whole series! They keep you on your toes with a love/hate relationship with most of the characters. The love stories are heart-swelling and some heart-breaking. Above all the show is breath-taking!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If there is one thing I can relate to, it's the fact that Sky doesn't cry. Ever. That being said, this book made me cry. Granted, I am also pregnant and my hormones are going haywire.<br /><br />Holder is...amazing. He is my new book boyfriend. It almost makes me want to shove my Kindle in my real boyfriend's face and scream WHY ARE YOU NOT LIKE THIS?! Again, that could be the hormones talking. All I am saying, is if a real-life man talked to me like that, I'd marry him tomorrow.<br /><br />Sky is an awesome protagonist. I can't stand your typical whiny, desperate, instantly-in-love-with-the-first-attractive-boy-to-notice-me-cause-I'm-such-an-outcast type of heroine. She is strong and makes her own decisions.<br /><br />Really, the only complaint that I have, and it's such a minor one, is that her best friend, Six, doesn't play a bigger role in the story.<br /><br />I'm not gonna lie. There are some heavy issues in the story. With that said, it manages not to be depressing. Mature audiences though, for sure! Go read it!<br /><br />P.S. If you like this story, you'll like the &#34;Barely Breathing&#34; series by Rebecca Donovan. Very awesome books.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Compelling,witty and a story that pulls you in! Maggie Smith is so subtley funny,she steels the show with her wit!
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|I have never been a Sasha Baron Cohen fan. But my husband adores him, so reluctantly we rented this movie. I hated it, and my husband was in shock at how horrible it was.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I enjoy the movie as much now as I did when it was released over 20 years ago. The movie answers the question of doing what you feel verses doing what is right. Magnificent performances by Clint Eastwood and Meryl Strepp.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I didn't make it twenty minutes into the movie with out crying. It is such a great movie for all ages and audiences.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is the second Jack Reacher novel I've read and enjoyed it as much as the first.  I intend to keep going on this series and hope Lee Child can retain my interest.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the app and the big boss monkey! U Have to buy it and the good thing is its FREE
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Touching, beautiful love story. I rarely care to watch a movie twice, much less own it. This is one of the rare exceptions. If you like romantic movies, you'll love this one.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Okay, the film came out some years ago, and I am not one to keep up with the new movies as they generally have way too much of everything..  But  when this one was suggested to me as very excellent, I bought it and watched it.<br /><br />This is one of the very best movies that I have ever seen, and I have not seen Russell Crowe in any film before now, to my knowledge.  If you love the sea and desire to learn more of how to have camaderie, and want to gain an understanding of the need for humility and great leadership in difficult and fun times, I recommend seeing this movie.
0452273331|5.0|Roarke is one of the best characters in all of literature.  His court room speech is some of the best writing of all time. This book is a far better read than Atlas Shrugged.
B00003CXRM|5.0|LOVE this movie.  Was interesting and the songs were great.  Didn't care for the strong language but it really was a good movie.
B00555X8OA|4.0|This is a much longer read than I expected.  Since I got the kindle version I feel like it's always a bit of a surprise how long the book will be :)  The book is very interesting & has so many things that make you think.  I do have to admit that it's a little creepy to think about that we have less control over our minds than we think we do!
1400159849|5.0|Mind bending.  Eye opening.  After reading this book you will never complain about your life again.  Have you ever considered eating undigested food from animal droppings?  Then you don't live in North Korea during a famine.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|This is a good enough ap. To be fair I have not given it a big shot because the Kindle camera is annoying. Why would I want photos of me all the time and how do I point and shoot. This is not to say I am not in love with my HD, I am but the camera is kinda a pain.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My youngest grandson could watch this all day long. Back to back.Great kids movie.We all love this movie. Grat price also.

B000EB73NC|5.0|very good item, like all Polar products, the quality of the materials give a you a mark of resistence and durability
B007WFTFG6|4.0|Bought it for my grandchildren.  They enjoy playing it when they come to visit.  Would recommend it to anyone with smaller children or grandchildren.
1250007208|5.0|Cinder has a problem with her foot. It's the wrong size. Not her shoe, her foot. Because Cinder is a cyborg. Intriguing twist on Cinderella huh? Fairy tales seem to be made to be re-told and adapted, but by far Cinder is one of the most ingenious I've come across.<br /><br />Cinder isn't a straight re-telling of the fairy tale--it doesn't merely shift the time and setting. Meyer's main character Cinder has a lot more say in what happens in her story than the traditional Cinderella who's just passively good and is rescued by a fairy godmother and true love.<br /><br />Meyer's tale is set in New Beijing in some far strange future where humans, cyborgs and androids intermingle, but where only the humans have any real status. And then there's Luna--a civilized moon with a terrifying queen who is constantly threatening war, if she doesn't get to marry the prince (and takeover the world that way no doubt.)<br /><br />Enter Cinder, a mechanic hired to fix the prince's android which holds a key national security secret. Of course, she's hindered in everything she does by a stepmother and at least one nasty step-sister. Still, Cinder fights for her rights and ultimately for her prince in ways that surprise and delight.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this book. It's well-written, fast paced with a lot of action, and a bit subversive. It left me with something to think about.<br /><br />If you like sci-fi or fairy tales, or romance, then Cinder is for you.<br /><br />This review can also be found on my blog: sarazaske.wordpress.com

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app more than my real alarm-clock and was a life saver since my alarm clock broke. I use it every day and I think I'd just about die without it. Has everything I need and some fancy additives I'll probably never use but I like the fact that I can- like having to solve math problems in order to shut it off if you want and having a maximum amount of times you can hit the snooze button. If you need an alarm, I'd say this one works great, Id totally suggest it. ^-^
B001GGZK02|5.0|Pandora introduced me to this band via my Killswitch Engage station.  I'd keep going to my computer to hit thumbs up for songs and every time I did I noticed it had the same album cover.  So I bought it and have been loving it.  I can listen all the way through without having to skip any songs, and to me that's a successful album.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I got the free app and have not been dissapointed.  Of course there are ads that pop up but you can ignore those easily enough.

0385344228|4.0|I could not rest until I finished this book! I read in some reviews that William Landay's characters in Defending Jacob are underdeveloped, and I disagree. They are fleshed out more than well enough, as the plot of necessity relies -- Landay intended it to rely -- more on the swift action provided by any excellent legal thriller. If I have any criticism, it's minor; he could have tightened up the editing by skipping quite a bit of the routine procedural courtroom exchanges and I'd not have missed a thing. But then, Stephen King could use a stricter editorial hand and I doubt he's lost many readers for it. Bottom line: It's clear this author cares deeply about producing quality work. That the story concluded after such a pitch-perfect, unpredictable crescendo I particularly appreciated. Glad to have stumbled upon Landay's book. Now onto his first two novels!

0060574216|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but John Gray's wisdom and insights about the differences between males and females is incredible. This is one of those books where your life will be changed forever once you have read the book and better understand your own male or female side.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I had been looking for an app such as this and, eureka!,  here it is!  One of the of the best!<br /><br />Great job.
B009GENZKS|4.0|This is not ths best resident evil movie nor is it the worst. Its a good rent . Recommend you rent the HD.....
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|Fun movie  - black and white animated.  My wife like it a lot!  Nice pace to the movie enjoy it.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm the adventurous type and I could see myself doing the hike. It was encouraging to know she survived and did it all by herself with only some help from kind folks along the way. I was sad when I reached the end because I felt like I reached the end of the trail with her. All good things come to an end. That's a hard truth to swallow in life. I was inspired and uplifted by this book.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Very nice, if i had more time to play it, I'd probably would be giving concerts by now, but unfortunately I'm not
B003HE2B6C|4.0|While there is that 'special' Hanson sound and back beat, it is mollified in Shout it Out. I like the kid-dude type stuff they did and wanted more, but there is a still that telltale Hanson sound in there, thankfully
B002SRQ214|5.0|im am perfectly happy with my processor, oc it to 3.9GHz just for a lil extra kick and has been tested and proven to be very stable so far
B00632HWOG|4.0|THis app works pretty well. Seems to move at a better speed than the regular web site. I do recommend.
1575666286|5.0|I first heard about the Gerson therapy on a documentary video called &#34;The beautiful truth&#34; ( that I watched on Amazon Prime! ), and because I have certain health concerns that I was struggling with, this movie had such a profound affect on me that I began to watch other documentaries such as &#34; The Gerson miracle &#34;, &#34; Dying to have known &#34;, and others,  so the next logical step was to purchase this book, and apply the principle's in my life, during this time a family member was diagnosed with stage IV cancer, and after reading this book, and starting the Gerson therapy has exceeded the 3-6 month prognosis given by her doctors in June of 2012, and is thriving and experiencing wellness by using the principle's in this book. So in my humble opinion, this book is truly miraculous! And once again, Amazon delivers a great product at a great price, no worries!
B00571F26Y|3.0|I completed the 10 day detox and I am enjoying the rewards! I lost weight and inches. My blood sugar went down 31 points without meds! I feel better and don't have aches in my knees. It is worth it and the book helped so much!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Amazing! Love the Americanized and female twist to it! Hope to watch many more seasons of Elementary! Please keep watching!
B00AFEXRME|4.0|It's a good movie, but two things bother me:<br /><br />The pilot's very aggressive tactics through the take-off in the storm (pushing the plane to its absolute limits) are never suspected to have compromised the integrity of the plane or caused the problems later in the flight. I kept waiting for that to come up and can't believe it didn't. The purpose of the scene is to tell us what kind of guy he is, but come on! Didn't anyone else wonder about this through the whole film? It's never addressed!<br /><br />Second ... oh, this is totally politically incorrect, maybe one of those things you might think but not say, but in no way suggests that flying or driving drunk is EVER a good idea ... I feel like this question hangs unanswered over the film ... am I the only one who wondered if it was his very lack of inhibition -- which one often sees in people with a buzz on -- that allowed him to take the crazy risks and make the wild maneuvers that kept the crash from being much worse? Ten sober, careful pilots couldn't recreate what he did in a simulator. Maybe this sounds crazy, but I waited through the whole movie for one of the characters to wonder about that. Yikes.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Love Kate Morton's intelligent suspense writing, involving intrigue, romance, human frailties and joys etc.  I think Kate has a gift for getting to the deeper issues in people and writing in a way that brings them out without pushing.<br />Thanks Kate!
B00992CF6W|1.0|what the heck mojang is super dumb!What is the point of this game? The graphics SUCK make your graphics better then ill like you
0762761296|3.0|As with other reviews this walk couldnt have taken place.With the limited resources they said they had they would not have crossed the gobi desert.Its a load of bulls***!!
B009AMANH4|5.0|Lincoln is a fantastic movie for all audiences! This movie represents an important turn of events in America. Lincoln by far was disliked by many for his tenacious desire to change the lives of African Americans. If you are a history lover this movie is perfect for you. After watching this film, there is a greater understanding of how difficult it is to pass laws for present generations. Lincoln is misunderstood but he had the ability to convince by his stories and light hearted sense of humor. This film gives a preview into the life of one our greatest presidents. This movie will be remembered for years to come, not only for its story line but for the believability of the characters.
1595826971|5.0|This book contains some of the most beautiful concept art. I love alice and wonderland and almost all of it's adaptations and this book was both inspirational and stimulating. It was definitely a one of a kind story and I hope to play the game soon.
B004GJYROG|5.0|My son had the VCR version of Space Jam and the VCR tape broke.  I checked Amazon to see if they had a DVD of it and they did.  I ordered it and came within a week.  It was great to surprise him with that tape.  He watched it almost everyday when he got it.<br /><br />Thanks
B001FB55H6|4.0|The movie arrived on time and was packed very safely as to avoid damage.  Easy to open and the move is great.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It was a not like most Pixar movies. I liked the characters and the animations Pixar movies just keep getting better and better each time they produce one. I recommend this movie to anyone who just likes movies.
B001V7P2MM|5.0|Purchasing the import Blu-Ray version of \\"Woodstock\\" was the right choice to make. Not only do you get the film itself on one disc but you also get all the extra footage from the expensive box set edition. So, if you love this film buy this wonderful Blu-Ray edition.<br /><br />Review Update: April 26, 2014<br /><br />According to the insert in the case it has the following exclusive content to this  Blu-Ray edition.<br /><br />Woodstock Untold Stories:<br /><br />Canned Heat: Woodstock Boogie<br /><br />The Who: Sparks<br /><br />Jimi Hendrix: Spanish Castle Magic<br /><br />4 Featurettes:<br /><br />Reflections of an Era<br /><br />A farm in Bethel<br /><br />Cinematic Revolution<br /><br />Woodstock Generation<br /><br />Review Update: April 28, 2014<br /><br />On a personal note: I don't remember the first time I saw the film. I either saw it on HBO at the early hours of the morning  or it was on my local PBS station with all the naughty parts cut out. Either way Peace and Love to you all :)
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I LOVED this app. It was great to know how much battery I am using and how much time I have left. It does the time for everything, which is a great feature.<br />Now the bad part. The app is a huge memory and battery waster. This isn't good if you are unable to charge your device all the time or want it to be super fast.<br /><br />Overall, though, I would recommend this app...
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is one of my favorite authors! I'm so anxious for her to write more! This book was such a fun story. Very hard to put down and a very unexpected ending! Well done!
B000W9399S|5.0|Love the disc world. This book has the embodiment of chaos mixed with a special mix of humor and flare that set this series apart from everything else
B00683JK9K|5.0|I never really did puzzles. After playing this, I find it addicting lol. My husband likes it too. Great app.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|OMG! After reading the Percy Jackson series, I thought nothing could come close but these books have blown me away. I just can't wait for the next one!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games ever. I'm not a gamer at all but I am truly addicted to this game. It was definitely worth the download!
B0091REZMW|4.0|My opinion is that this game is very good to me because you can go on quest ,go to different room's and you get points for retrieving stuff.
B000G8NY4U|4.0|Dissappointed  I felt a lot of the background affects distracted from his wonderful music and the musicians..despite that Yanni is such a great and talented musician I loved his performance
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read and re-read this book, and each time I read it, it never fails to amaze me. This book will make you laugh, cry, and think. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00005B1W5|5.0|I have always loved this video and venues both in India and China amazing!!<br />I hadn't watched this for some years and was so pleased to view it again and remember just how incredible Yanni is....  the music is stimulating and the passion that Yanni has in his presentation and involvement is just phenominal..  Was so disappointed his tour to NZ and Australia was cancelled as I had booked my ticket to the Melbourne concert.. There is no doubt his concerts in historic venues are outstanding compared to indoor venues!  His concert Live at El Morro,in Puerto Rico was also of the same calibre Without a doubt Yanni's compositions inspire and uplift.. that's what the world needs! Thankyou Yanni!
B00ANW33CM|1.0|For starters the graphics are incredibly nauseating. The game itself requires extreme patience and speed. The game is timed. There are somewhere around 48 levels. It may just be me but I really don't think mahjong should have levels. If you have the patience to be constantly turning the screen to find a match, you still shouldn't get this app. I wouldn't even consider this mahjong so much as a game for people who have no life. Take my word for it and don't waste your time with this app.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is really cute with all the different reasons you can create. I am having a lot of fun with it!!!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I love Angry Birds.  I hate the pop up ads -- so intrusive and annoying, breaking your concentration and game-trance.<br /><br />I really wanted to buy ad-free Angry Birds for my ASUS transformer -- I'm hooked!<br /><br />However, for some reason -- what madness is this??? -- because I live in Canada, I'm not allowed to purchase.  WTH?  I thought we had trade agreements and civilised stuff like that.  I am sooo disappointed and ticked off.  Time to get a copy of AdFree I guess.<br /><br />grrrrr.  I'd like to pitch a few birds at whoever imposed this senseless prohibition.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Yes the special effects in this movie are stunning, no argument there.  However the basic cinematography and production design were sorely lacking.  The poorly-chosen camera angles failed to engage the viewer.  The drab sets and color-filtering made everything blend together into murky grey soup where nothing pops off the screen.  Instead of creating a visually stimulating look, we are left with nothing worth looking at.<br /><br />Somehow Charlize Theron manages to capture the attention.  Her bearing, gestures, and timing are of the sublime quality we have become used to in her work.  Without ever going over the top, she does create a presence.  Her delivery of the script is the best that can be expected of an actor working with a script of such soporific banality.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart should just hang her hat on the \\"Twilight\\" series and call it a day. This is the type of performance that the term \\"dialed it in\\" was made for. Her performance was a flat and lacked any sort of affect. There was nothing in her eyes and face to suggest the presence of a character.  Her delivery rose to the level of the pedestrian script and went no further.  There was nothing in her mannerisms or physicallity that generated interests.<br /><br />The cast as a whole seems to be very talented and committed to delivering a quality performance.  However their efforts are wasted on a poor script set in an ill-conceived setting.<br /><br />There has been much excitement in reworking the classic fables into something closer to the originals.  This particular movie could kill that kind of interest fast.  This movie does not have enough substance to be considered a change from Disney.  Truth is this movie has nothing worth considering at all.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've tried a number of apps to capture YouTube videos.  This is the best I've come across.  It's easy to use, and can be used for search and playback as well as capture.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|Got it for my older brother who has been a lifelong Zelda fan/gamer.  He liked it and said he plans on using it to play card games with his 7 year old daughter.  Each card had a different either Zelda character or item from the game on it.  Good quality printing and card stock used.
0790729393|1.0|Not a good dvd.. You actually have to flip it over in the middle of the movie to watch the thing... let down
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The novel follows the misadventures of Jun Do, a North Korean (sort-of) orphan. A Dicken's type tale of a life and country we can only shudder to think about.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|There's a familiar saying that fits my sentiments exactly and that's \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\" Apart from the song Hidden Away, I was so disappointed with Illuminations. Josh Groban has definitely \\"redeemed\\" himself with this one. Great vocals without the irritating and ad nauseum (sp.?) falsetto, and a very nice and mellow CD for those  of us who love just the beautiful voice of this very talented young man. Very highly recommended.
B003P8D6JQ|2.0|Hey. So what can I say? I loved the movies, but the sound tracks are way better with the motion picture than on the stereo.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I recommend this product for protecting the Kindle Fire HD. It was worth the price too. Looks good as well.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|It is too small for the Fire HD, so I can not even use it! The add did not state what it would fit.
B004U52VPS|5.0|It is hours of fun... The only problem is to aim at the structure with the birds, takes a little time to perfect.
076115678X|5.0|My 12 yr old god-daughter has curly hair and her mother and I do not. We were at a loss as to how to have her style and manage it. I asked a friend what she would recommend and she suggested this book. Once the daughter opened it, she could care less about her other gifts. Since then she has book marked and highlighted several passages.<br /><br />Pictures are current and up to date too.
B009IF82SK|4.0|A Great Show, but getting a bit stale -- needs more punch and characters to play off of -- like Zack.
0470932139|5.0|I was engrossed in this book from the moment it arrived - I managed to read it cover to cover in 24 hours and then prepared a dish and took photos using techniques and advice from the book. The immediate improvement in my photography was astonishing and it's getting better every day. I can only attribute that to this book. I love that there is just enough detail to explain the basics without being overwhelmingly technical. There are also so many hints and tips on the food & styling side too. I always wondered if Helene lived in some enormous castle with 100 different tables to use as backdrops ... now I know her secret!<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone whether they are a food blogger just starting out or a more experienced photographer who needs to know the secret of making food look as appetising on the page/screen as it is on the plate.
0345803485|4.0|I see what all the hype was about. I finally read fifty shades and I could not put the book down. Although I wasn't exactly infatuated with the red room some of the explicit scenes did get me and boyfriend worked up lol. Grey in and out of the bedroom is appealing but a lot of the extra baggage that comes with grey is not. There were dozens of talk shows with real couples talking about the book and women and their fantasies. I will admit women do like (even if they don't admit it) a guy who has a \\"I got it, you don't have to worry about anything\\" personality and can actually be trusted to deliver on that but with grey extra baggage the whole \\"submissive\\" world is far from the biblical meaning of husband and wife lol. All in all a good read and ladies don't forget to read some of those explicit scenes to your man u might just get something cooking lol.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|Got this for my Dad for Christmas and he loved it.  The original is such a great movie.  Glad it's in Blu-ray
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is soooooo fun!!! You all will fall in love with this game. I love pudding monster!!!  New levels coming soon YAY!!!!!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had heard all the hype about this series of books so I decided to read them and the books match the hype.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I got this for my son.  I put this in his stocking.  It is a really good movie and he loves it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The books are as good as all the hype that I had heard . I am glad I read the whole series.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|If you haven't watched this series.  I seriously recommend just buying this one.  Season two just came out.  I'm getting it asap.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had heard all the hype about this series of books so I decided to see for myself. They are really good.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I offically have all three seasons of this show.  If you haven't watched it yet.  You need to get into it.
B003UBTX72|5.0|This book was an interesting read. It was interesting to see how the super rich and really famous live. A little slow moving at times.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I am really glad that I found this game. I haven't been getting much use of my Kindle Fire as of late, but I am confident that that will soon change. As for the game it downloaded and installed smoothly, and so far has played wonderfully. The music and sound effects hit all those old school Final Fantasy notes, and makes me feel like a 12 year old again sitting in front of my SNES. I love it!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was one of the best book I have read in alone time.  I think I like Moreno it was like a regular couple in college.  There was no vampire or magic powers.  Just unbreakable love.
