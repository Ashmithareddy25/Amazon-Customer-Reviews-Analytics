6305728437|5.0|My daughter LOVES this movie, but has wanted it on VHS for years. We have scoured thrift stores and yard sales, and here it was on amazon.com the whole time! When she opened the package, the squeal could be heard for blocks. Thank You so much!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Could understand the husband/wife relationship.  Kept me thinking and surprised how it ended...I am from a small town so I related.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It's a page turner! Only David Baldacci can put such excitement into words.  A great read. I recommend him to all my friends.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love this show and can't wait for the next episode. They do need to update his arrow with more tech.
B0013DC5B0|5.0|I enjoyed the music of this movie and now I can get it anywhere on my Ipod. Tenacious D rules!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Modern Family makes me laugh out loud, seriously.  I love that this show is not filmed in front of a studio audience, I hate canned laughter shows.  You have to pay attention when watching or you are not going to get all of the humor.  They have done a great job of developing the characters, which I think is what really makes a good show.  Cameron is by far my favorite character, he cracks me up.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|The message from this book is beautiful.  No matter what trials we must go through, no matter how we are treated, we choose how we will respond.
1451695195|5.0|Maybe because of his profession, but his honesty and his way of describing his experience was very enlightening.  I would highly recommend this book.
1442444053|5.0|I have read Watership down at least twice, and recently listened to the unabridged audiobook which included a lengthy narrative by the author about how he came to write the book, etc.  I love this book, and thought it would be an excellent gift for my 12 year old granddaughter who is an avid reader as well as an animal lover.  The author mentioned this illustrated edition, and after viewing it,  I ordered it without hesitation.  It is a beautiful book, definitely one for a collection, and my granddaughter was thrilled with it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is way better than the original face book app on the kindle fire this app is very nice and good
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty shades has done it again! About to download the third book! I am officially hooked! E L James knows how to keep a story entertaining for sure!!!
0451228375|1.0|Mr. Follett must hate the church as each book shows it in less than stellar light. Each book could be laid on top of the other and you would have a difficult time seeing the difference. It is a tired and over used storyline. This constant degrading of Christianity is beneath Mr. Folletts abilities and writing skills. Put your talents to something fresh and vibrant. We will all be glad you did!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|50 Shades of Grey was a thoroughly captivating sensual experience. E L James challenged my inner self, how far would I go? Excellent Book I can't wait to move on to 50 Shades Deeper.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I don't know how they come up with movies this sensational I only wish I had half their talent. I love this movie.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Horror at it's creepy best, a great cast deliver gore and fright and sex all rolled up into one scarefest not to be missed!
B004LROUNG|4.0|I thought that this book was informational and entertaining. The characters were very colorful and laughable.  The plot kept my interest.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I purchased this movie as a gift for my sister who loves the movie. The only downside was having my sister sing all the songs from the movie over and over for the next week!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I knew that I am too scared to watch the movie. So I read the book and it was amazing. Can't wait to read the next book. :-)
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I love P!nk. This is a great album from beginning to end. It is clear she was going through some tough times in her relationship when she was writing, and as many of us do too, the music is very relatable. Pick it up--you won't regret it!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This movie was so much better than the second. Not as novel as the first, but what sequel is? Recommended if you like the first.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the show and downloading it for viewing was so easy.  I will do this again in the future.  It is a good value.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|We haven't finished the season, but it's a gripping series. There's the possibility for an upgrade to 5 stars, but that will depend on how the season finishes out (and me remembering to update this post).
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I have had this app for a good month or to I like it because of listening to music u can download The hole video (when u have WiFi) then when it finishes u can watch it later without Wi-Fi my baby sister really enjoys this app I recommend it to everyone who likes utube video's good bye

B000FC1JMQ|4.0|This is my favorite of Jane Austen's so far! It was very easy to understand the dialogue and it is the type of book that kept me reading it till I finished non-stop. It has the perfect amount of romance for me!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was well written and it made me use my imagination. This book was written for everyone to enjoy.<br />Pwalter123@comcast
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was the best book I have ever read how Katniss and Peeta survive the 3rd quarter quell is amazing. I love this book
B0083Z614S|5.0|I HAD NEVER READ THIS BOOK AS A CHILD. SO GLAD I HAVE NOW READ IT. THE AUTHOR IS TRULY GIFTED.  THE PAGES CONTAIN MUCH WISDOM IN SIMPLE BUT BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTS.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is addictive - the harder you try, the more you want to beat it.  Good for all ages.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|When I first bought my kindle FIRE I saw this game in the apps section and read reviews and stuff I finally downloaded this game and I can tell you I @$&amp;#ing love this game.just what the doctor ordered...a simulation of apocalyptic and epidemic preportions. A Must have for someone who loves a good game of extinction on a bacterial or viral level!
B0063IH60K|4.0|My husband prefers playing this on the computer.  I like it because of tapping the card and it moves on its own.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually watched the movie before reading the book. As always, I liked the book better. But the movie was a good interpretation of the book. I definitely suggest reading this book and  I can't wait to read the next one!
B0072GPQNG|2.0|I saw this in the theater, Christmas 2011.  The landscapes and scenes are beautifully filmed.  Your eyes never get tired following the camera.  The story-line is adept at intertwining the lives of the main (human) character and the horse.  But ultimately Spielberg has nothing to say about life, or even about the cauldron of war, into which the characters are drawn.  I have noticed this lately - Spielberg cannot characterize life in any of his recent movies - he sits back away from the action and renders no judgments, offers no points of wisdom.  A real bust, considering he is considered our greatest director.  There is one point in the movie that offered an opportunity.  The father of the main character takes out an old battle pennant under which he fought in years gone by and offers the following advice to his son (I misquote): \\"Son, let me tell you about war.  War is bad.\\"<br />Really????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's all that Spielberg has to say about war??  How incredibly shallow can any one man be?  I really wonder if this is simply part of his liberal ideology - the inability to think critically about topics without ideology jumping in with inane comments such as \\"war is bad\\".<br />If you enjoyed this movie, I'm glad.  It apparently fed you in ways that you enjoyed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is addicitive!! I don't know when to stop playing! It is easy to play. I would tell others about it.
B005LAIGP0|3.0|I was sort of disappointed in this movie.  I would never have purchased this movie if it hadn't been to see how Danel Radcliffe fared.  Radcliffe was okay but there just wasn't much to the script to work with.  This gave me no indication as to his acting range which is something I've been curious about.  Though I love all of the Harry Potter movies, I've never thought of Radcliffe as stellar actor.  I know he got rave reviews in Equus on stage but I personally hate that story and would never see it again no matter what genre. So I wait.
B000M2O6AQ|5.0|Loved it! Loved it! and Loved it!<br /><br />Books was amazing, movie is amazing.. the perspective showed in this movie is perfect!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is consistently good.  The acting is very good, the scenery is beautiful, the history and story line interesting.  I think this is one of the better TV shows.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I got this DVD set for my ex-son-in-law and he really has enjoyed it.  I also enjoyed watching this show.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|The greatest Friday evening share a martini and maybe more with the one you love music.  Wonderful performances and players.  Highly recommended.  What an amazing value!
B001JAFYFG|3.0|The movie itself gets 5 stars because it's one of my favorite childhood, campy 70's Sci-Fi adventure films.  I remember pretending to be Logan shooting down imaginary foes in my basement in the 70's as a child, jumping over my couch and making laser gun noises and running through corridors.  Yes, I was a real nerd underneath and back then, we pretty much had to use our imaginations, as there were no computers or even video game consoles at the time (76-77), let alone cable TV.<br /><br />In any case, the Blu-Ray is disappointing, it contains the commentary and promotional film versions, and of course the original movie, but other than the aspect ratio upgrade to HD, apparently there was nothing done to restore or alter or enhance/improve the film at all.  You can still see the artifacts and blacks (even on a high quality Samsung LCD) are not deep or solid.<br /><br />The indoor and late movie scenes look better than the outside model shots of the city, and it's of course a definite improvement over the standard DVD version that's been out for years now, but I was hoping for more.<br /><br />I truly wish they would remaster the film for Blu-Ray and its legion of fans.
0345803485|2.0|I have read numerous negative reviews of this book.<br /><br />But, they forgot to mention that Ana, the female orgasm phenom, has a great and \\"unexpected\\" gift:  no gag reflex, so she can swallow Grey's enormousssss phallus in one gulp.  Oh what joy!<br /><br />Click your heels and sing \\"Somewhere over the Rainbow...\\"<br /><br />The popularity of this dribble of a novel shows that the Wizard of Oz indeed exists.<br /><br />And, proves that you never know what will sell.<br /><br />Despite over fifteen-thousand horrible reviews, this book has outsold real writers by a massive margin.<br /><br />The author is on her yacht while most are in their dingy study.<br /><br />Take your medicine and swallow.<br /><br />And, hats off, or pants off to the \\"writer\\"....misnomer that it is.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book has depth of character and a story line that kept me engaged.  I couldn't put the book down.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I gravitational pull is kinda cool. It's fun. It's different. My son likes it. Keeps him busy for long periods of time.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A book about friendship , wonder, and fun!!! What I really liked about it was that it had other people's point of view about August or their own lives.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|It was a great action movie I could fell their pain and it was a really awesome movie I hope there is a 3.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|the only problem is that it pauses or it take time to react and that will not help to avoid the trains but is fun when it works
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love these books there so funny!!!!!!  And I love the little pictures they give you these books rock and there funny!!
0553103547|5.0|My husband is a big fan of the Games of Thrones on TV and this book was just as good as the movie.  He is looking forward to reading the others.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I saw this at the theater as a child.I bought it to compliment my collection for when my nieces visit.<br />The transfer to blu ray is flawless and the audio has been done VERY well.<br />If you have children,then this is a must have flick
0553381695|5.0|If you are a fan then this book is a must.  My husband enjoyed this one as well as the first
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes quality sci-fi, It's the opposite of a space opera, taking place in a very finite space. Will be looking forward to reading more in this series.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Intellectual, visceral, intriguing and emotional. You will be in this film as you experience the turbulent events. Fascinating for myself having recently watched and reviewed [[ASIN:B008Q0D2QU The Hunter [HD]]] and [[ASIN:B00932AA5G Headhunters (With English Subtitles)]].<br /><br />Discount 'Headhunters' as a comparison since that film is straight forward man against man action caper. The link with 'The Hunter' is worthwhile for they both are journeys of the mind along rugged and unspoilt terrain. I knew nothing of The Grey save for it being supermarket cheap, has Liam Neeson and something about wolves. I shan't spoil it for you with further elucidation. Suffice it to say that it is much, much more than that.<br /><br />Really excellent soundtrack will test your speaker system. What I got from it most of all was the real emotional pull that comes from understanding how beautiful we are as individual human beings. So many beautiful lives have ended. Will always end. Real life is so far, far away from our media frenzy. Money means nothing. Nothing.<br /><br />An exciting movie not sentimental. Directed with flair and imagination. Men being men. Man alone.
B005OP7162|5.0|Revenge has something for everyone with its cast of characters and multiple story lines. It's full of action, drama, romance, and mystery. No drawn out drama and waiting before the &#34;action&#34; really happens (like a soap opera) - every episode is I full of twists and turns!  I don't usually get caught up in TV series, but a friend recommended this one.  Since two full seasons had already gone by, I felt it was a little late to jump on board with the current TV showings.  So, I rented Season 1 and started from the beginning.  I got hooked after the first show and had watched all of Season 1 and just started Season 2.  Once I'm caught up, I will start watching the current current episodes.  I won't miss anything, because Amazon lets you rent every single show, including last week's - you don't have to wait until the season is over to rent episodes.
0765325950|4.0|Like many here, I started reading this series as a teenager and have anxiously awaited the conclusion of this epic tale.  Mr. Jordan created a very complex world with a multitude of characters and plot lines and I commend Mr. Sanderson on his ability and perseverance in finishing The Wheel of Time.  I do understand the vexation many feel that the e-book release is so much later than the hardcover release since I too use an e-reader now.  However, I was going to buy the hardcover anyways to complete my set and will eventually buy the e-book version when it goes down in price.  Put yourself in her shoes for a moment people.  Your loving husband's life legacy, the thing he will be remembered for, is coming to an end and you want it to finish with a flurry.  I don't think it was about greed but more of a fitting end to this legacy.  They've had plenty of chances to capitalize on projects if they were solely worried about the money.<br /><br />Now for the book review!  I will try not to post any spoilers.<br /><br />AMOL is pretty much non-stop action from cover to cover.  Sanderson's writing style is much different from Jordan's which you can see from the last two books.  He was given a complex tapestry with numerous threads and did his best to finish it while keeping true to the story/world and his own writing style.  There are tons of instances of amazing sequences and interactions.  There were also a lot of unsatisfactory plot line endings.  However, that's the nature of writing and story telling.  Not everyone will die a hero or is invincible and not every action or sub plot becomes game changing.  I may dislike how some of my favorite characters ended up but to me, if the author invokes such emotion then he has done his job.  I don't envy the burden and criticism Sanderson has had to deal with in completing such an epically extensive series.<br /><br />You can really see a different voice and characterization in a lot of the main characters of the series since Sanderson has taken over so it takes some adjustment because it doesn't FEEL like a Jordan book.  Gone are the flowery paragraph/page long descriptions of descriptions.  Sanderson gets to the point and moves on to the next story line.  The story is predictable at many points since the series is based on prophecy and foretellings.  However, Sanderson does a great job of transitioning from Jordan's characters to his own.<br /><br />I too was somewhat disappointed in the ending.  It seemed the two Aes Sedai with Rand could've been utilized a little better.  It wrapped up a little too nicely.  But I think/hope/pray this leaves it open for more stories to be written about this world be it from Sanderson or other authors.  I loved the battle scenes and the feeling of despair and uncertainty that you can feel in the air after days and days of fighting.  Things do tend to happen TOO fast at points but I was still turning the pages as quickly as I could.<br /><br />All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it very hard to put down.  Thank you for finishing this series Mr. Sanderson and thank you for creating it Mr. Jordan.
B003DNN0L2|3.0|The movie was very fun to watch, but I had trouble getting the video to play. Luckily Amazon was nice enough to refund my rental fee for the troubles
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read in two days simply amazing!!!!! Great book from beginning to end!! This is the first book I have read by the author but I will definitely be looking up others!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It is such a realistic novel with real people and though it may be seen as melodramatic, it is perfect. I had to take breaks letting my kindle charge but I could have easily finished it in one day. I will never forget this book. It is captivating, eloquent, with a beautiful compilation of characters. One of my top five new finds.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is a truly great album, one of the best Bruce and Co. have ever released.  It will make you tap your foot, dance, sing, laugh, and cry.  Truly stunning.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book took me by surprise. There was a definite thrill factor that made it hard to put the book down. In the end the book comes together for a fantastic ending.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|great movie wanted to see it theaters but missed it. wife had it on her wish list for xmas so i ordered it and well it's a movie we liked it. you might not. but it arrived in time and was as advertised.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I bought this for my Grandson..and he loves it. Gives him a little challenge and time with Mom and Dad
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was amazing and I really liked it. I think you should write more books. I love your books.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he ended up breaking up with me a few days before the holiday so I just sent the movie back.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|My wife and I love Celtic Woman! Their sound is so soothing, yet at the same time so moving. Even our young sons enjoy them!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|These songs are Nashtastic!  Pure enjoyment from beginning to end. So glad they're still including the music in the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Simply amazing. Fragile yet unwavering, Hopeless was a love story of epic proportions.  This book deserves 6 stars...or 600. I was hopeless in thinking I could stop reading and put it down. Colleen Hoover is now one of my very, very bestest favorite authors in the whole wide world.
B007BRJYF2|4.0|First game I purchased on my Kindle and I enjoyed playing it.  Did not come across any problems.  I would recommend this game for all ages...

B0087JTAKW|5.0|Everyone should read this book. They may learn something if they don't already know it! Thank you Mitch for this life lesson.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|There are lots of great TV shows out there these days. Many are superbly conceived, well acted and skillfully directed, but Madmen I would say is part of an elite group that has a distinct purpose, a distinct voice. True, there are other shows that are more &#34;exciting&#34; but there are only a hand full of shows whose whole is so profound and well conceived as to be breathtaking. The arch of Madmen is much like the curvature of the earth, only visible with height and distance. While every season is uncompromising in its character development the series must be viewed from afar, as a whole, to begin to understand the true trajectory of its characters.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Finished in a matter of hours. Couldn't stop playing until I had it finished. Still plan to play it again, see if I missed anything.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I thought i was going to hate this re-imagining of Sherlock Holmes, but i was pleasantly surprised. This show manages to keep some of the wonder of the original concept while bringing it into a complex modern world. Though, this show does not go beyond &#34;fun&#34; it does deliver that much with a breath of somewhat fresh air.
0525952926|5.0|I am a ardent follower of Ken Follett.<br />His knack of taking fact and filling in with<br />startling fictional scenarios.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|This is a great book. I would recommend it to anyone. I haven't seen the movie yet but anxious to after reading this wonderful book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!!! So funny and witty, the story never left you bored which was wonderful. I couldn't put this book down. Great twists and the love between them was fantastic. I love this author so much! Definitely recommend!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Good story, good writing. LIFE OF PI is a book to learn from.  PI's intelligence captivates the reader and carries him through a marvelous adventure.  Did it really happen? Only you can decide.  I shed a few tears myself when Richard Parker escaped into the jungle.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|I was never able to get the game open therefore I haaven't played it.  I only hit the stars to get to say this Thanks
B009LFVV6M|5.0|My sister is obsessed with the notebook! i bought this as a birthday gift for her.. i know she is going to love it! extremely fast shipping! very satisfied
B0076DELIG|5.0|Classic Connelly/Bosch;In a  relentless pursuit of justice.  Who wouldn't want Harry in their corner? He never stops in his drive for closure for the victims whose lives are cut short. Some new territory with his daughter but really it's all about Harry! And I never fail to get some great jazz recommend from Harry (thanks Mr. Connelly)-George Cables is as classic & old school as Dectective Bosch.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Sherlock has been portrayed many ways by many actors, but this actor nails it on the small screen better than any has on the big screen. You forget you are watching an actor playing Sherlock but began to get the feeling you are watching Sherlock himself. Of course, the title alone which comes from: &#34;Elementary,&#34; said he, shows the detail of creators who chose to portray Watson as a woman. In modern times this would be the most likely union giving us a body show, almost.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was an entertaining read.  It really draws you in to the main character.  It is sort of a &#34;character novel&#34; but also a bit of a mystery.  It held my interest and kept me guessing a bit.  It is also refreshing to have a character who deals with the topic of self-mutiliation and is human.
B008D28HYS|5.0|got this as a promotional freebie but would have paid for it, starts easy but gets more complex, I'm even taking my Kindle to work so I can play it at break # addict!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I liked the characters in this book.  It reminded me of how I liked the characters in her other book I read.  It is a bit racy but nothing like 50 shades.  This is much, much more tame.  Just enough. Know that there are some touchy subjects included such as pedophelia so it could be upsetting to some readers and is not for the younger crowd.  Entertaining.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Wow. This was really good and emotional. Now, where is the new version? :p Awesome and so fun to read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So attached to these characters!!!! Wish there was more to feed my hunger for this story! Heart is full! Thanks
1451695195|5.0|I was given this recommendation by my mother in-law. It is simply amazing! A highly suggested read for any/everyone! Really makes me reflect more on my physical world, myself in it & my relationship with God. For those who question the existance of God or for those who believe in God, either way I highly suggest everyone read this truly wonderful book! As always shipping was prompt thru Amazon Prime.
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|This was worth the purchase. I highly suggest the buying it if you are looking for the original Eurythmics soundtrack.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|It was an action packed and fast paced espionage thriller, but I thought there was perhaps too much it was trying to cover in the script , probably why the writer was only able to wrap up the story with pages of epilog in the end.<br />The research in some China aspects were also poor, in particular the linguistic perspective.  Some of the words and phrases used in the dialog of the Chinese characters were uncommon, if not unheard of.
B0024CEY36|4.0|Ken Follett seems to always get your attention at the first and keep you going to the next chapter.  And combines it all with a history lesson!  Or two...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I cried like a little baby. I fell in love with both the characters and felt their pain so personally.
1451613512|4.0|i an a history buff. this book met most of my expectations. what it lacked was a definite stance on  some the proven issues. However, it pushed me to seek more information on issues.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Great songs, wonderful lyrics, fantastic big band sounds behind the voice of Frank Sinatra.  Like to swing dance then this CD is a must.
143911000X|5.0|It wasn't very securely packed but still arrived in one piece.<br />Its a good read, Great book for blokes.<br />Thank-you for this item.<br />Very Funny.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|Well, what do you expect from your children?  In an orient culture, still maintained after assimilating into the American culture, the children are socially required to obey.  What outcome do you think will occur?  Will the children conform to their mother's expectations, or will they rebel?  Will the mother's projected lives of the children be met?  An insightful look into the American-Chinese culture.
B008UFUOH6|4.0|Heard a story on public radio about this disc and as a long-time EBTG fan, it piqued my interest. Not bad, I actually might play it in summer-time, just like they said people might do on the NPR segment.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's books. His creation, Mitch Rapp, has been a fantastic character. I know there are a lot of men and women in the CIA and military that risk their lives everyday to defend this nation. Mitch Rapp is a tribute to all of them. Thanks Vince and keep 'em coming!
0767817664|5.0|saw the newest fright night...love the old one much better. first run movies to me are always the better movies
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have read all of Nicholas sparks books, I have to say this is not my favorite of his books but it was still very enjoyable! I love that it had a happy ending unlike most of his books. It was a nice change to not be sobbing uncontrollably at the end of it,ha ha. I would recommend to any one who is a fan of Nicholas sparks.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|it wont download for me. I no this game is like the # one game but not for me so if you have a kindle fire don't get it

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept your interest while reading it with all the &#34;turns and twists&#34;. I am still thinking about how it ended and trying to decide if I liked the way it ended.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I've watched the secret a few times years ago but never read the book. I was encouraged a couple weeks ago by a psychic that I met with to read this...as reading I watched it on Netflix a couple of times. I just loved READING this. I would read out loud to my kids also...such a benefit and I'm on to the Power! Thank you to all involved and thanks to Kelli for telling me to read this!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|However, it always makes me think that Jack Reacher is a perfect superman......impossible right. But story is ok. Little hard to believe at times.
B004J64QR4|5.0|This was done exceptionally well. It makes you feel like you are sitting in the audience. The grand finale alone is worth the price of admission. Great companion piece for the movie version with Jackman and Crowe.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love it. I need 18 more words to fill this space so... basically I've spend every free moment I have had in the past couple days watching this show. I can't wait to find out if Brody is a terrorist!
0802473156|5.0|I know several people reading this book and it's great for anyone whether in a relationship or not it's great for practicing and perceiving
1612931103|4.0|The book was quite much older than expected (from the 1920's). Although the proper ways of grammar has not changed much you can definitely see some of the obvious changes of the English language. In spite of that, it still is a great little book to brush up on some of the finer lines for writing. It is quite useful. Glad I purchased it.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Not a great fan of this game.  Its okay for passing<br />time if you are just sitting around with nothing else<br />to do.
0525478817|5.0|Moved me. For many reasons. The reality that true love is something that's rare these days and the miniscule probability that I will find for myself or for somebody I personally know are amongst them.<br /><br />Easy read. I did not stop reading even if I needed to, because it was a page turner and my need to finish it compelled me strongly.
0316228532|2.0|Loved all of the Potter books especially the earlier ones. Tried to get through about 100 pages of this but the number of ill-defined characters left me behind. Trying to sort them out became too much for me.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My husband and I love this series, it such a great escape and a history lesson also.  you won't be disappointed.
0316069884|5.0|A huge awakening thanks to Jonathan Safran Foer. Putting glass windows on the deep dark places of our food production. Our nation consumes millions of pounds of beef, pork, poultry....Where are all the animals? Eating Animals in necessarily graphic when it needs to be, has to be. It is bringing consciousness back to what we have made a most unconscious decision.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon and Eva 's story had me hooked from the beginning Each book is a wild ride througb the lives of  two people trying to find &#34;normal &#34; whatever that is with each other. Marilyn Allen
0517543052|5.0|This book will enlighten you in ways you never expected. Extremely unconventional in it's approach, it's more like having an elder to refer to at your own whim; a serious of stories, words, letters strung together to pluck the brain strings of the faraway corners of our minds that are so often not encouraged to resonate with the rest of our beings.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is a really good book not many pages in it i would say theres around twenty five words on a page
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I totally enjoy playing this game.  Graphics are great and the game is challenging enough to keep your attention.  I would recommend trying you will be hooked.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story, I love the twists and turns. So ready to read the third and final book of the hunger games!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A excellent read for all ages. its sad and funny and romantic. I have recommended this book to my friends
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is great 4 people who like to go on daily and just build and build.great app don't judge a app by its picture.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds has been my favorite app ever since it first came out. Now this particular game has definitely met expectations. Angry Birds Star Wars HD follows the Star Wars series with the birds playing the roles of the characters instead. Continuing their battle with the pigs with newer techniques to help players get through each level the game offers and the game offers a lot of unique challenges never seen in an Angry Birds game before. This game is highly recommended for those or all that love the Angry Birds series and Star Wars fans alike.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is one of the best ever u fly on a jet pack collecting coins. and the best part is is that the jet packets come in crazy formes
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This is a really fun and cute game that's perfect for the younger audience. Fun mini games, raising pets, and much more. I've never seen the show, but I can guarantee to those that have and like it will definitely love this fun little game.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|i don't consider myself a prude, but this one was hard to get through at first.  By the end of the Trilogy i loved the book.
1600597963|5.0|If you want to further your skills on bead embroidery or just begin it, I highly recommend this book. Great pictures and information.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the end of this incredible story line.  In my mind, Christian has come full circle with the help of a very patient person
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Easy to read and not too full of the drama that one tends to find in these types of books!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Was feeling more comfortable with the story once I got through the first book.  This is a a book that is not for the<br />prudish person.  You have to open your mind to the way other people are wired
B0075HP2K4|5.0|Birdy is one of the best new artists out there right now, imo.  Her voice is just breathtaking, raw or layered in song, and I don't think she's given quite enough credit for her unique sound.  Very, very excellent album.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I think J.K Rowling should stick to writing for young people.  I had a hard time getting through this book.  At times, I felt<br />there was a plot in the works, but mostly it was just plain boring.  Plus, writing a conversation in that cockney accent<br />of the British was hard to get through.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Another great release from Ellie Goulding!  Similar to her first record, but only in the good ways.  Definitely a keeper.
B00514HDNW|4.0|This was my first journey into the vampire genre and it was a great appetizer. The writing is crisp and the suspense is palpable. I found the entire book easily digestible and after two days I was sad to see this story end.<br /><br />It is immediately evident why this book was made into a movie - though (and I write this as a fan of the movie overall), in many ways I wish the film had stayed truer to the book!
B008UUPOVM|5.0|This is the third or fourth Owl City album I've purchased in full, and I still can't stop listening to all of them.  Adam Young's music is gorgeous, and the fact that he isn't afraid to step out with his beliefs have only served to triple the depth of my fandom.  Owl City sounds different in every album, which is part of what makes the adventure -- yes, it's definitely an adventure -- so exciting.  Top favorite album right now!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best series on television.  The other one is Game of Thrones.  Thoroughly enjoy the acting, the Abbey and the script.  Will continue purchasing as we go along in order to enjoy later again.
B002APU580|5.0|pride and prejudice I love this movie it had good acting and was very well done  l give it five stars and that is why I Bought it
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Funny! It was a nice read and a bit insightful.  Who would have known she was a drama weirdo in High School.  Genius comes in all forms!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|It's awesome for editing but needs more creative sticker and stamps like ladybugs like cute stuff and it does leave me upside down on my kindle fire HD and more designs but only only that I like it if you add that I'll rate again 5 stars if u do that &lt;3
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Totally love her music.  Listen to Adele all the time.  Will be purchasing more of her work.  Very talented lady.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit ninja is a fun game to play when you have free time i love the game. When i play my whole family loves it
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|love this movie. it's not for kids but a very funny movie for adults I laughed the entire time great
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book better than movie!!! A lot more detail so better images. Good action  to story line! Can not wait to read next book in series!!!
B007WKEM8C|5.0|I'm completely smitten with this cookbook. Deb's lighthearted style coupled with her well-tested and well-explained recipes make it a brilliant addition to my cookbook shelf, which already houses many, many printouts from her blog. When Deb shares a recipe, it's practically guaranteed to be a keeper!!
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I have a Bose Soundlink and a Jabre bluetooth speaker and this device connects my iPod Classic to both of them no problem. Everything is controlled by my iPod once connected which was a snap. Just plug it into the iPod once the speaker is searching for a bluetooth connection and it connects every time.
B00843TZJ2|5.0|brand new in the box great work from a band started from three other bands folk band ledgans they make more
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Hey George.  Look, let's sit down and talk about this.  Really.<br /><br />Okay. Please restore the original trilogy you released in 77, 80, 83 respectively, on Blu-Ray, if you please.<br />You don't have to admit wrong doing with that other thing - you know, the special editions I just torched in my back yard.<br /><br />Give Han Solo his character arc back so I can pretend to be worried that our heroes are getting in with the wrong crowd. You know, we understand you felt like your property was being taken from you - but that doesn't mean you have to tit-for-tat all of us. We'll still get behind you on these new movies, man. But.. you see... everyone was there when you released the original trilogy. We remember how it was.<br /><br />So George - we love ya, man. Just quit being so high-and-mighty and find that little independent filmmaker in you that says it's okay to be wrong every once in a while. No big deal. We're so behind you, man.  It will be historic when you release the original ORIGINAL trilogy on Blu-Ray - we won't rub it in your face or anything.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|what can you say her best work and thats saying a lot she will only get better with time i love it
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|another exciting adventure game by G5. Great graphics, story wasn't lame, no bugs. HO scenes pretty simple but I never look forward to doing them anyways. I<br /> want my sequal please!
B008K6DU4Y|2.0|Works as a tablet player, nice features but didnt play mp4 movies using Seagate NAS 110 through Skifta app..its ok
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I did not think it was as good as Fall of Giants but, look forward to last book of the trilogy.
0241951461|5.0|This is my favourite book ever.  I've read at least 1,000 books and this one tops them all.<br /><br />I first read it when I was at school, and quickly devoured it, only stopping because I was in fits of laughter.  As soon as I finished it, I read it again, then re-read it once more.<br /><br />I've read it at least a dozen times since then in the past 30 years, always delighting in the hilarious stories of family life and the beautiful descriptions of Corfu's scenery and wildlife.<br /><br />It led me to read dozens more of Gerald Durrell's wonderful books, and to read Lawrence Durrell's vastly different books which are wonderful in other ways.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to young and old.  I read it to my son when he was about 10, and he adored it.<br /><br />Thank you, Gerald Durrell. You made this world a better place.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|What an amazing film!  I can't believe I never even heard of it until the DVD came out!  Absolutely outstanding.  Top Notch performances from the stars (both the good guys and the bad guys).  Terrific atmosphere and special effects.  They capture the spirit of the Judge Dredd universe perfectly!<br /><br />I can't wait for a sequel!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a good book.  Read quickly but no twists and turns or unpredictable events.  Written very well.  I would recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game for when you have time to kill and has many different games available so it doesn't get boring fast
B000L53D4O|5.0|Excellent choice. My grand daughter is learning to walk and it's Light weight enough for her to push and turn it. It's a buy again item
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the book, it held my interest and was the first book I downloaded on to my PC using Kindle for PC. The plot was intriguing but left  many of unanswered questions left for a a reader which is why I didn't give it five stars. It would be a great one for a discussion group.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I was very happy with this product. It was a good buy. I would recommend it to other buyers anytime.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|The question of mental illness in Silver Linings Playbook: For me, the mental illness worked (and was not exploitative) because it was the kind of mental illness that we all suffer from to some degree (a desire for perfection in love and in life). And for all of us part of growing up is figuring out how to deal with this lack of perfection, this fact that life will never be or feel perfect. (So throwing the Hemingway novel out the window was awesome, a way of recognizing that even in art life is not perfect----Melville has a line \\"the truth comes in with darkness\\"). For me, the Bradley Cooper character just suffers from an extreme version of this shared human malady. And so we all kind of recognize ourselves in that character. So for me this particular mental illness (theatrical as it is) is a convenient way to visualize a common human failing. And to outwardly reveal just how destructive unrealistic expectations/unrealized dreams can be (those things we usually keep hidden away). The director is dealing with pretty dark and disappointing truths here but in a way that allows us to both connect to Bradley and let go of our own unrealistic expectations (or whatever it is that is spoiling life for us) as he does. And the comedy is part of that healing. (The other great scene in the movie is the crotch face plant---an example of something going wrong but this time being perceived as being kind of perfect anyway. \\"Yeah we got a 5\\").So many Hollywood movies are about chasing larger than life dreams but this film is a nice earthy corrective to that blatant disregard for realism and how real people really cope.are so much like us and thus stand as constant reminders of our own vulnerabilities and our own failings) have only our best interests at heart and want us to be happy. Of course the cure involves each individual family member realizing how he or she affects each of the other individual family members and also how each individual relationship within a family affects the overall dynamic and functionality or dysfunctionality of the entire family, and this understanding of the family as a network of individual but also interdependent psychologies makes everyone more aware of their part in the family drama (as well as the freedom they have to change that part and alter their own psyches and the family dynamic for the better). These kinds of insights/reminders are therapeutic for all of us. Pat has a lot to work through but he gets a lot of help, both on the personal front and the home front, from Tiffany. Its her toughness, her sass, her staying power, her outsider lucidity, that ultimately proves to be the ingredient that Pat and Pat's family need to look at things squarely, mend properly, and become a functional team once again. And of course Tiffany is everything that Pat needs and she knows it and just knowing it gives her the strength she needs to set all of these various rehabilitations (including her own) in motion. She is the one with the playbook, and she is the one who assures that everyone gets their silver lining.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper is especially impressive in the early scenes when his character has not yet gained control of his illness, but Jennifer Lawrence is impressive througout hitting every emotion with pinpoint accuracy and effectiveness. If you're not already convinced that she is the best twenty-something actress working today, this film will put your doubts to rest.
B002RSDW80|5.0|The dvd came on time and completely in tact. It was a good product. I was happy with the result.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Before purchasing this &#34;Original UK version&#34;, I read reviews unhappy with the &#34;PBS&#34; version<br />because of over-editing. This UK version indeed seems to flow very smoothly, telling the story in full.<br />It's like a historical novel set in real places with real historical events unfolding around the characters<br />so I especially enjoy learning history indirectly by watching life in 1912-1920 in England.
630514415X|4.0|The dvd arrived on time. It was exactly what it said it would be, so I really appreciated the product.
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|this movie is just ok nothing to write home about the action tend to be lost all over the place, it was a waist of money ,I regreat not wating to see it on tevelsion
B002JC9RMY|4.0|I liked the action and the comedy the movie offered. Not a lot to the story line but overall a very good movie.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|The DVD &#34;Amazing Grace&#34; is a reminder of what one man can do to improve our lives years into the future.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Not enough words to describe how wonderful this book is! Love, life, death, art, beauty, truth, lies, nobility, cruelty, selflessness, -everything in one book. Very complex ideas but easy to read. Beautiful, lyrical language but brutal honesty.  Each character has been fully developed and contributes essential depth to the story. Heart-achingly poignant. Everyone should read this book at least twice and buy it as a gift for good friends. I'm grateful to my friend for recommending it!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The clear graphs are great.COULDN't ask for a better product.  It's accurate and easy to use.  The graphics a great.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Quality writing with excellent character development; a good story!  If you enjoy Michael Connelly, you will like this Book!  Buy!
B00A757EFW|2.0|Look and sounds the same<br />As old but controls are very awkward at best. Don't bother getting, save your moray for something better
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I had read the first book of this trilogy and loved it. This book was a bit too long and somewhat confusing in that it followed the lives of so many characters. However, I did like the book, overall, and will read the third book when it becomes available.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!  Finished in one week! Would recommend it to anyone! Better in book form than the movie! Loved it
B003QSEKTU|4.0|The movie was good, my daughter enjoyed it once we were able to get the movie to play. Why isn't Amazon compatible with google chrome?? Super annoying.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Not the biggest fan of claymation (or clay similar) cartoon and also would have liked to see this movie in color. However, it is a clever retelling of the Frankenstine story with a very cute dog. Thought parts of the movie were very funny and overall superbly entertaining
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|American Horror Story season 2 is a bit of a disappointment.  I gave Season 1 five stars, and I do still anticipate each episode of 2.  It is, however, really choppy, almost to the point of incoherence.  Too many characters with little resolution, even too many characters on screen sometimes..  The alien, zombie, demon and psychopath elements of the story leave me, at the end of the day, with the feeling that whoever is telling this story,, isn't telling it very well.  Jessica Lang is incomparable, Kit seems to be wondering about in a daze, and although there are some elements of the story line that are interesting, and well played; ultimately I just don't care
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Love this game so much. Very fun. Very addicting. It's also hard. It's a fun and funny game. Awesome game.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />This book is awesome and I think you should definitely read this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It is about an adventure with a boy, a girl, and lots of other people.  Matched is the first book in the series and if you haven't read that already read it before you read this or this won't make any sense.  I know I am about to read the next book in the series: Reached and know it will be just as amazing as this was.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is better than the last two books in this series it has more action and more ba boom
B0068FZ1C8|5.0|I have had my eye on this movie! I already have it on DVD but it was just one of those movies that I needed on Blu-Ray!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|We can't wait to see each episode.  This is a very clever series, with exceptional acting.  Johny Lee Miller is amazing.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Its more scientific than I would have liked it to be but I think he's trying to sell his fellow scientists.  He doesn't give us the description to enable us to feel his journey.  I would like to talk to him.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|Great music for singing along on &#34;road trips&#34; ! All the songs bring back great memories. If you don't have it - get it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|can't quite pin down how it is different from the version on my table top.  Its good but not as good.  The nice part is you can be anywhere and use it.
0307960471|4.0|I have read every one of the Harry Hole series... loved them all. I couldn't get into this one as much as the others though... I'm not sure why but I'll try to explain. It was almost too detailed about drugs and the drug pushers... maybe too much description of the dirtiness and seediness of drug life ... and it just kept on and on describing it.<br />When, he actually talked about the characters then I tuned in again. I have to admit I kept putting the book down and going an doing something else. The story, itself, was good - the drug pusher part, not so much. And I'm not a person who doesn't understand the seediness of that kind of life - I worked in child abuse for 21 years...I just thought the long descriptions of the life and workings of drug dealers was overdone<br /> It's about a new drug called violin, drug smuggling, and the control of drugs in Oslo. I've never been one for stories on drugs and drug rings, it's just something I'm really not interested in. But as Nesbo's brilliant writing kicked in and the plot took form I became more interested. As the story develops it becomes so much more - about family, relationships, morals and ethics, life and death. Nesbo is so skilled at laying clues and plot footholds as the novel progresses they don't even register. His ability to investigate the motives of the litany of characters drives the complex plot with its twists and turns, which leaves you puzzled, guessing (mostly wrongly) - and absolutely stunned at the climax.<br />It is not my favorite Jo Nesbo - or Harry Hole - book (for the above mentioned reasons) - but it is still a good read - if you like drug dealers and unsavory characters - lol
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I'm assuming this is the app that I use for Skype.  Its my first time with Skype so anything is great.  I'd be interested in a better camera or maybe I'm just not familiar enough with it.
0345803493|4.0|Still in awe; this book shows the effects of abuse and how it will effect the home lives of all those that it touches!
0385535147|2.0|John Grisam is feeding same plot scenario on his last couple of books and this one is no different. It felt that he started from the end and build his way up to the beginning.
0345803507|4.0|Couldn't believe that so much could happen without sheets or a bed. The child within has more to share in the next book.
0385535139|2.0|Another Grisham books where he thought of the beginning and end and just filed in between pages with hollowed plots
0345803485|4.0|exciting ending! Christian has a long way to go and poor Ana has the job of steering him into the right direction.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|this was a cute movie, ironically  all my grand daughters liked it more than my grandsons did..I wonder why? LOL
B00881VLCE|1.0|Magic Puzzles--disappointed!!!  How many times do I have to say that I do not like this puzzle puzzle puzzle puzzle
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|this is one of the very best animated movies , i have ever seen.my whole family has really enjoyed it
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|All these long years and horrible home video releases, Heaven's Gate finally gets the respect it deserves. It's name: Criterion. If it has to be one company to get a home video release right, it has to be Criterion hands down! They have proved themselves in the past and once again proved themselves with this wonderful blu ray. Over the years MGM has released this movie in horrible transfers to us fans (even an over matted Laserdisc couldn't look right). But finally someone got it looking right. This is one gorgeous looking (and sounding) picture. I have never seen it look this good! I was shocked to see Criterion picked this title up for release. If you want a transfer done right, you need The Criterion Treatment. The colors are bold (not muted) and the detail is back (althought there is still that soft focus that could be from the photography) and it is in its proper aspect ratio (and ANAMORPHIC!!!). Thought I would not live to see the day when this film would get an awesome 1080p transfer. I have seen it on MGM HD and it still looked muddy and hard to watch. But Criterion got it right!!<br />You either hate this film or love it. But you got to love this transfer! Beautiful indeed.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|we have always been a fan of dr seuss. the moral that this story teaches is great , worth a 5 star rating
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Pretty interesting movie.  Christian Bale was terrific as the future Batman.  This movie didn't get the attention it deserved because of the tragic situation that occurred on debut.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|For years, I have thought that this wonderful play would be impossible to turn into a good film. I was right.
B007EECSFA|4.0|A very good read. In fact not much was done around our home until I finished. the story line was woven in a wonderful manner.
B0068TLD3A|5.0|I love this book.  I like it so much because of the purple crayon and all the cities and houses.  I like the pictures.  I like the front of the book. -Elias (4)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a delightful interplay of the lives of the titled and the servants who live at Downton Abbey.  It is a period piece beginning in 1912 with season 3 beginning in 1920.  It is beautifully acted by a delightful ensemble.  The story lines ate realistic and engaging.  This is why I believe it is a hit in over 200 countries!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|well I play all angry birds games but this one has to be cheaper than the other games I mean put a discount on it
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It seems like new games keep coming out all the time. I just don't see how they can all be worth your time and money. But still, Pudding Monsters delivers. For some reason I didn't like Cut The Rope that much. But their next game has caught my attention. It's really fun and silly to keep kids glued to it.  But it get progressively harder and harder. This has kept my attention span. It's free so I recommend trying it out and I think you be surprised at how long you find yourself playing without realizing it.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|This book was recommended by my teenage son.  I really enjoyed it. I had to concentrate at first because of the story within the story, but soon got lost in the whole thing and found it hard to put down.
145210655X|4.0|Gift was for big fan of Star Wars and his 5 year old son.  The Dad so enjoyed it that he read it on the spot.

B0073RBQY2|5.0|Schleich's quality is amazing. My grandchildren are the envy of all their friends. They play for hours with these figurines.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|Unless you need a formal printed doc, this is much easier for quick note taking, personal journals organized by subject. Many features, NOT &quot;over-permissioned&quot;. Would be a 5 star except for lack of documentation and no  &quot;HELP&quot; options. Available thru Amazon a plus.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|There were lots of things I loved about this book.  Most of the reviews already cover this, so I'm not sure what I could add.  I especially loved the allusions this story made to The Secret Garden.  The mystery was really nicely laid out, also.  I figured it out probably about 2/3 of the way in... Morton drops maybe 2 hints too many if she wanted her readers to be surprised by the ending, but it didn't at all ruin the book.  In fact, it made me want to keep reading more - as in, &#34;OMG, when are the characters going to figure out what I already figured out!  Aaah!&#34;<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to a guy though.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Great trilogy, I wasnt happy with the ending in the first one but knew something great had to happen in the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have seen Season 1, 2 and now 3 in the last two weeks, and love the series.  Was recommended by a friend.
0743243153|3.0|Hard to get involved with it. it's very informative but written in a way that you have to look for the hidden meaning. It's not something to read unless you're very focused. Not easy reading material.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I found it way to involved for an android device. Not user friendly and to many instructions. need something quick and simple.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The book is fine. It was written really well. I never liked Steve Jobs anyway but it's a good book for anyone who works in management. You might learn a thing or two about how NOT to manage your people.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I use this alot in my business where I have to give quotes and estimates on the go. Just what I needed.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|very entertaining family fun. just wish the new levels were out already,  ive passed all of them now. id even pay for the new levels that's how much we like this game :)
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I'm not saying that this is up there with Gone with the Wind and Casablanca, but it is up there with Movie Gold such as Clueless and Bring It On!
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|im sure this is a great game from all the other reviews ive seen, only problem was i couldnt play it on my phone, it probably wasnt compatible though i have android 2.2 so im sure thats the problem
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I did not want to put the book down. It was so interesting and brought together all the subplots and characters into a great mystery.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|i really enjoyed it, their are a lot of customizable features such as peices, table and color. top 10 game in my book
B003H6KRIE|5.0|A series to remember.  The books were very good.  The storyline and the actors really brought to life a secret service person's actual life (as far as I know).  I'll keep these around and re-read the books....what I haven't said is the thrill I get everytime I watch them.  They never get old for me.  I love Matt Damon in this role...He and the role were perfect for eachother.  This is one of my favorite series..the lethal weapons, Die hard's and Matrix are also thrilling movies where the actors really \\"became\\" their role and brought it to life just as the Bourne saga did.  :)
B008D37J6O|2.0|i was very disappointed in the user interface. i prefer a very easy to use interface and this just wasnt up to par for my standards
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|As I call it money rain coin dozer is a fun game that in includes prizes that you can sell have fun playing coin dozer!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3<br /><br /> .....I love it!  It constant in changes and yet the characters are the same...<br />I love Shirley McClain!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|The item was purchased yes, however, I was not able to download it for play. I am no longer comfortable with the process of the quick purchase and play poccess....
B005VPRF0M|4.0|Fabulous company.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because I don't care for violence, or for Batman, but my son wouldn't agree. :)  The instructions are easy.  My sons don't play with the Legos when they're built, because they really can't stand up to that kind of energetic play. I think that's just the way it is with Legos, but I still feel they are a fantastic product that help children so much with eye-hand coordination, spatial thinking, and so forth.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|If you are a Star Trek fan, this movie is for you.  It is an adjustment to get to the new actors playing the characters, but nevertheless this is a great movie.  Great for one's DVD/Blu-ray collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not my normal style of reading, but I was hooked from chapter one.  GREAT book. Can't wait to start the next book in this series.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater, and it was an adjustment to the first three Terminator movies, sans Ahnold.  However, unlike many others, I do like this movie very much.  Looking forward to the next one(s) in the series.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The 'boat' story is extraordinary in its clarity.  Could not put the book down.  This could be a parable for the ages to interpret.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Great movie!  It really hits home to the meaning of Christmas, especially for adults who have been around much longer than children, and understand life more.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Money well spent, Carries an amazing amount of stuff, great protection, Solid good looks. I use mine almost everyday, work, air travel etc. VERY nice product, have had several months now.    UPDATE: here it is over 2 years later. I have abused this thing. It is my daily bag for computer etc. Have used it as a carry on when flying. Roomy, really built to last.Easy to take computer and 2-3 days of clothes rolled up on a trip. I feel like I should buy another just to have on hand to replace but this shows no sign of needing replaced as of yet. It was well worth the price. 10/10 would buy again.
8866130923|5.0|My search for the perfect datebook is over.  This productis awesome.  I have seen them in stores and never gave them a second glance, but after reading the reviews I decided I would give it a try.  I love that there are lined pages for taking notes, making lists or whatever you fancy.  There is a removeable tabbed section and a small pocket in the back which I did not know about when I ordered and it was a nice surprise.  I really didn't think I would find the stickers useful but they are actually pretty cool.  I will order the same one next year (maybe in a different color just to change things up), but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|A great addition to my other Mentalist DVDs. This was a gift and I'm so happy to have it to add to my collection
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent!  Keeps you in suspense until the very end!  The characters are interesting;  all of Grisham's books are good and I enjoy them.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|great album, great sound, great lyrics, worth the money....going to see them at the end of january - can't wait
096798467X|5.0|I built an oven using this book and its fantastic.  I look forward to building another sometime or helping out a friend.  Includes some good bread recipes too!
0525953728|3.0|Mark Owen (pseudonym for the SEAL who wrote this book) does a great job of sharing his experiences as a SEAL. The first half of the book is primarily about his military life prior to the assault on Bin Laden's compound and the second half of the book is about the planning of the mission, the mission itself, and the aftermath of the mission. I appreciated the fact that he skipped over his experience of getting through BUD/S, which many SEALs who write books feel that they need to write about at length. I did enjoy reading about his training to become a member of DEVGRU, commonly called SEAL Team Six. The visuals of Bin Laden's compound were also helpful in getting the reader to visualize the actual assault. According to Owen, there were many misconceptions and half-truths coming out in the media and he felt it was necessary to set the record straight about what actually happened. Even so, it was obvious that he left out major details of the planning and the tactics used in the mission.
B005XI94HY|5.0|I love the unique sound Florence has, and I enjoyed the 1st album , so I decided to grab this after scanning the reviews. Now I've had it oh...3 months or so and I'm still picking it over most of what's on my IPod, day after day for the work commute.  Beyond her phenomenal voice, the music is incredibly ...immersive and full sounding.  I hope her future albums are just as good or better!
0765325950|1.0|I have spent the money for every ebook in the series. I'm very disappointed that the final book is not available for my iPad.  I can no longer read the print in the hardbacks but on the iPad I can make the text as big as I need.  This is the age of electronic books, no glasses needed
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I like the Oxford American Dictionary. I'm still learning how to use my dictionary on my kindle fire. I'm satisfied so far.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|We fast-forwarded to get to the end.  Bad.  Just bad.  Maybe it read better as a screenplay.  Seriously - it *must* have.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is not like most of King's books. It's missing an element that's usually present in most of his writing, even the books that don't take an out right trip to the horror-verse. I'm not going into details though, because that would ruin some of the chilling suspense this book has. None the less, I absolutely loved this novel. It was intelligent (as King's writing always is), suspenseful, chilling, heart breaking, and absolutely beautiful. I read the whole thing in two and a half days and this, my friends, is not a short read.<br /><br />The characters were engaging; you fall in love with them and then get your heart broken. It's a terrible angst that, I think we as readers just love to hate. This isn't a novel that moves a mile a minute through the majority of it, however I can't say I found myself bored at any part. Beginning, middle, or end.<br /><br />Speaking of the ended. My god, that was a bit of a shock. I was expecting for our hero to majorly screw up the future some how. That wasn't surprising (and I don't feel it's a spoiler, because, be honest, you kind of expect it from a time travel novel). What surprised me was was exactly the way that King wrote it. I certainly wasn't expecting things to play out quite as they did. Not too predictable. I hate that too, invest all your time and attention to a story, with an ending you saw coming two chapters in. Also I'd like to say that it was really refreshing, to see an ending actually resonates through the rest of the book. I'm not saying you necessarily get your questions answered, but the ending brings a close to reoccurring themes. No one could accuse the ending of being rushed. It was clearly very well thought out.<br /><br />Read this book, it's a good one.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was very well written and gives the reader the perspective of life with a mental illness and how the main character views the world from his own perspective.  This author must have had some first hand knowledge of mental illness to write such a beautifully written and sensitive account of the main character's life experience.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Loved this book as well as all the others in the Fever series.  Had to read all of them once I read the first one.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|this colection has lots ofstuff, ter is the movie in black and white and color, the original teaser,and a tv vesion which stunk,therewa a cometary,thy say there ar 2 commentarys, but its only one
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Okay...it took A LOT of convincing to spend $339 (GREAT SALE price at Amazon) for Legos.  But because I have an 8 yr old son who really PLAYS with his toys and not tires of them, I decided to place the order and so, SO glad that I did.  The directions are EASY and thoroughly simple.  By page 8, my son and I felt like Lego engineers....invaluable mother/son time.  It will be a Christmas we both will never forget.  No regrets.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|What can one say about a show that is with out a dought the best I have seen in years. I do believe that British productions are much better done that what is prouduce here. whant to purchues seasons one, and two.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This was recommended to me by one of my patients, when she accidentally said the &#34;F&#34; word, and then started laughing hysterically.  She had just read this book and said it reminded her of it.  I downloaded the book.  It is a quick read, and there are several hilarious moments.  I really enjoyed it and plan to read it again soon.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love this TV show. It always gives my husband and I a good laugh. Also fun to watch with friends :)
B00AAX68HG|1.0|second time I tried to down load it. After that I give up. I don't have trouble with other down loads.
B005JR3Y5W|4.0|Really like this show. There are a few episodes that are a little scandalous, but the show is funny and will make you laugh.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Found story good~but predictable. But, I guess, what Harlequin book isn't. Kept my attention. Thnx for the read. Karen T.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love suits. The only thing I didn't like was how short the season was. Looking forward to the next season though!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|My favorite book, so it is really nice to have it as an E-Book.  E-Book's are a really good idea for people on the go.
B005544V6A|5.0|My husband and I were hooked after the first episode. It has a good story line and is also light hearted and fun
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So far so good. But I could've saved myself 4 bucks if I realized they play the previous weeks episode before the new one comes on.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It't wont load and once it loads I have to force close it and the one on the Internet is WAY BETTER witch is kinda stupid cause the one that you down load it should be better than the Internet so I am just going to stick with the Internet and not the app. I would go with the app if you would update it you should try that.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Takes you to a place no one has been before. Mixes space technology with human feelings and emotions.<br />Bravo, Andy. Bravo !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The best love story ever!! I have read all the books and they are so hard to put down!!I am an addict to 50 shades!!
0767802470|5.0|If you are interested in WWII, and especially the Atlantic Ocean area of operations, this is an excellent movie by any standards. Granted, it is about a German U-Boat, and crew, and is in German with subtitles, but it is by far the most intense, well acted and well written film about actual life on a submarine ever made. You get a real sense of what daily life must have been like and what it feels like to endure depth charging, with almost no hope of surviving. The sense of claustrophobia is extremely intense.<br /><br />There are very few movies out there that come close to what this does to show the horrors of war and the human toll of serving one's country, while disagreeing with its policies and leaders. An unforgettable and remarkable movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a page turner, couldn't put it down especially towards the end. I wish they would have developed Kevin's character more especially at the end. I would have liked a better ending, as in \\"justice served\\" type of ending, but most would probably say he got what he deserved.<br /><br />This book really had me on the edge of my seat. Slow at first as the story builds but once you hit that cliff hanger, watch out!
0847830942|5.0|The author, Jan Heine, publishes Bicycle Quarterly, a magazine having a heavy focus on \\"randoneering\\" bicycles.  Most reviews and articles are about bikes made of steel or titanium, not carbon fiber, and oriented to non-racers.  He is an expert in the history of the great French bike builders of the 1930's to the 1950's.  It was during this period that they entered their bikes to compete in harsh road tests to see who could build the lightest, fastest models with the fewest part failures.  Many innovations were made during these trials and his book documents how they evolved and literally created the bicycles we see today with front and rear derailleurs, racks for carrying loads, integrated lighting and so forth.  This book covers that golden era by documenting, through many beautiful photographs, the innovations made.  One reviewer gave this book a low rating claiming it ignored builders in Italy and other countries.  But that is not correct.  Only the French developed the exacting measures used to evaluate bicycles over trying road courses with constant monitoring stations and a thorough inspection at the end of each race looking for any part failures.  This book is a must-read for those with an interest in bicycle development.
141659521X|5.0|While Vince Flynn may be my husband's favorite author, this one certainly thrilled him! He read it in two days!  And Amazon got it here on publication date!
B008XG1X18|5.0|there is always something new,it picks me up on a bad day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!cant get enough.love it great stuff for everyone.<br />young and old.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|Great for children and adults alike.  My son loves watching this. Watches it over and over.  This word count requirement sucks
1907523588|1.0|To the Lighthouse is a 330 page book.  In this edition it is 120 pages, because the print is so small you can't read it and the margins are practically nonexistent.  I had to purchase another edition that I could read.<br /><br />As to Woolf's work itself, it is difficult to follow, although it has brilliant pieces in it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I put two DSLRs, two flash and a number of extra lenses in this backpak.<br />The configuration is easy to adjust to fit your gear.

B0025KVLVA|5.0|I am a long time Beatles fan and being a baby boomer I've had the pleasure to have grown up in the rock and roll era.  A lot of iconic music and bands came out of the 60's, some of whom still play today.  The Beatles have  ALWAYS been on the top of my fav list and no matter how old I get, I will never tire of their phenomenal music!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's hard to stop creating things!!!!<br />I find it super addictive!!!! I could play on it all day and it just fills like a little bit of time!!!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I have been listening to this soundtrack nonstop since it arrived, and it is fantastic.  The only reason I can't give it 5 out of 5 stars is because most of the people I see during my daily commute must think I'm insane, because I'm driving around belting my heart out and crying.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Got this because of my boss, she suggested it and we now have a competition going. Really enjoy it. thanks
0316223239|5.0|This book is probably one of the most difficult books I've ever tried to review.  It's so hard to categorize it and there is absolutely nothing out there like it.  We see the world through five year old Jack's eyes, and it's remarkable how Miss Donoghue manages to depict this.  Jack is so believable and so heartbreaking.  Jack's Ma had been kidnapped when she was 19 and held in a small (11'x11') sound proofed shed for 7 years by a man we only know as Old Nick.  She never sees the outside except through a sky light.  And she has Jack two years after her abduction.  We come into the story when Jack is 5, but we see what his world is like in this prison.  To her credit, Jack's mom provides as much stimulus as she can for him and as a result, Jack is a very intelligent little boy that knows how to count, read and write.  She manages to create a world for him that is safe and wonderful from within the confines of this room.  The last half of the book is all about Jack and his Ma's life outside, and I think that this part is even more sad and poignant than the first part because everything is so new and scary for both of them, and they each have a huge adjustment to make while living life outside of Room.  But we have Jack's perspective of everything throughout this wonderful book, and that is a special thing indeed.  I think it made me even look at things differently in our big old world.  Above all, this book is not sad, but it is poignant, profoundly affecting, and a book that depicts love like no other book I've ever read.  I am glad I took the time to read it.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|My favorite love story. Touching.  Interesting how each lover changes with their issues of life. Great chemistry between Alda and Burstyn.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|From all the media about it I thought I &#34;should&#34; read this but frankly am not to interested.  Possibly in the future.....<br /><br />Lois
B005LAJ212|5.0|Great Service. Happy to use again, telling everyone I know about this and to use them for all their needs.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have loved this game, and even my 6 year old has had fun playing it!  Fun for the whole family!
B0058YPL66|5.0|Great Service. Happy to use again, telling everyone I know about this and to use them for all their needs.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app! I keep all of my information in this little notepad. It's very helpful and easy to use!
B002GHIPYI|4.0|These sound great. Hands down the best sounding pair of headphones I've owned. The only drawback is that the earpads are a bit stiff and uncomfortable.and that they initially clamped down on my head, but I stretched them out. With some new earpads, they are very comfortable, too. I have no problems wearing them for long hours.
B008N1V11U|3.0|this game was great until it froze and I couldn't go any further. I tried to get around it but it kept on screwing up.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Games are fun.  But have contacted support twice still waiting for responses. So  I am not too happy with that.
B009OA57MI|1.0|I bought this app and loved it, I had not played it for almost a month and when I came back it was freezing so I tried to uninstall and reinstall only to find that the app is no longer supported on my Kindle Fire.  Thank you Rortos for basically stealing $2 from me, I hope you appreciate it because I certainly don't.  I also don't get why Amazon won't refund me the money for this app.  I will never buy a Rortos app again because of this experience.  I am very disappointed in both Amazon and the company that created this app.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I have always enjoyed playing pac-man.  This is just a short trial one.  The games don't last long.  Fun.  May buy it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|truly lov this game .....play it all the time its the boom .....its one of my favorite jewels games to play ....
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I didn't down load it correctly or ??.  Will go see the local Radio Shack gal as soon as I have time.  Love the Weather<br />Channel.
B000JMKO3C|5.0|As a huge fan of Paulo Coelho, i have feverishly read all of his writings. Each one of his books has the reader undoubtedly every time take a look at his/her own life and in someways changes the reader forever. Its hard for me to say i like one of his books more then the other, but i can honestly say Veronika Decides to Die is one of my all time favorites. I would recommend this book to anyone who is alive! :) It really had me step back and review how i live each day. Am i getting the most out of life? Am i living each day as my last? Or am i standing back and watching life pass by? This book is not only a beautiful read, but it is almost like a manual or reminder of how precious life is and how there really is only time to follow ones heart!!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game has the best of both worlds... Samurais and zombies, it doesn't get any better than this! Good fun!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|simple to play. a no pressure game when you want to play while relaxing. you don't need to spend cash unless you just can't wait to earn coins or acorns. but the game provides opportunities to earn both if you aren't in a hurry.
B007WFTFG6|4.0|my son loves this coloring book. He uses it quite often. Its great for trips to the doctors office or while waiting anywhere.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I love HIMYM - 7th season did not disappoint! My purchase arrived quickly, and I'm very happy with it! Thanks!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it! It was combination romance and mystery. Good character building and very suspenseful. I feel anyone, especially females, will love it!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It was soooo super cool until one day i clicked on it to play it again and then it would not work. So it's great for overall experience but it crashes sometimes.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like the app, but I found that facebook is not very much my thing. So I deleted it. But the app was very helpful. Thanks
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Rarely does one enjoy such perfection of the art of moviemaking, but this series is one of the best quality productions I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty.  Of course, you have to be willing to immerse yourself in the period of the very early 20th century Britain to fully appreciate the delicate balance of inherited wealth with its aristocratic power and superiority, and the stark contrast to the service professionals who make the formers' lives painless and their palates sated with the finest foods and beverages.  Interestingly, in this series drama, the sense of the beginnings of a teutonic shift in these historical social structures is artistically and subtly presented.  The acting is superb, the credibility amazingly portrayed, the character development never done better, and the tension of main as well as subplots all conspire to produce an astoundingly superior production.  The writing and acting is also done with such naturalness and just the right application of emotion, wittiness, and sarcasm that all of the dramatic elements are developed with extremely compelling success.  The costumes and the sets within and outside of Downton Abbey are also incredibly spellbinding.  Outstanding.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This is such a fun game. However it is kind of hard to play with the finger arrows. Its hard to turn corners and move around fast.
B009FBX5M0|2.0|While the movie was good, this was a very disappointing soundtrack. This is the first soundtrack I've heard that did not include the movie's main title. Secondly the James Bond theme was missing. A couple times I thought the music was leading into the theme and the theme would have worked very well in those places, but it never did. Some parts of the music were good but it never reached the level of prior Bond soundtracks.
B004I744AS|4.0|This app is very nice to have. I use it alot when Im not sure what a word means. I also use it for my 7 year old son.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|i love this book.  couldnt put it down.  already purchased the next one, service and it is great as well.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app a lot to balance my check book and when I go shopping. I find it very helpful.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Love love love this movie!! Great action, great story line. My husband and I have watched this movie over 50 times. It's definitely one of our favorites of all time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app. I can either read along or just listen to it. I listen to it mostly at night in my bed. I can find scriptures too.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I don't understand why this novel has been so popular.  I've been struggling to get through it for the past month. I should just put it down, but I hope it will get better.
B005HSL626|4.0|My 7 year old son really likes this game. He plays it a lot and  I would  never delete it cause he likes it so much.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|The nice thing about Sir Paul is that he has chosen material that is both familiar and yet not overdone by other rock artists trying to emulate the American Songbook styles of the early 20th Century. Dianna Kraal is a big hlp, of course, and McCartney has an excellent team of producer, production and players to bring this off beautifully. Especially liked Bye Bye Blackbird, and Paper Moon.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is a lot of fun. I play it a lot and so does my 7 year old son. Sometimes I get Angry. Now I know why they call it Angry birds. Its very challenging too. I cant stop playing it sometimes.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great show!! Mystery, psychological thriller, scary, romantic, can't believe they did that, and definitely....what will happen next!  I always enjoy each episode!
B004UID2LC|5.0|You tube is awesome. I watch it a lot. So this app was nice. I get to You tube fast. I use it for my Kindle fire.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this on a whim on the strength of its many endorsements and No. 1 status, and I was not disappointed. It's a riveting read, the setting is very realistic, the characters well-developed, the story full of satisfying twists and turns. A job well done, and money well spent. Why it's called Wool, though, I have absolutely no idea.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a oldie but goody game. It just another one of those things I play when I am bored.  I love it.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Enjoy the album, visits some of the most well known songs from the movie but at the same time misses out on a good chunk of songs. Hope they will release a full version eventually.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game. Its fun to play and sometimes my 7 year old plays too. We like it.
B0052REUW0|4.0|Pinker describes how much more humane western European culture, for the most part, has become in the past 500 years.  His reasons for this evolution seem forced and inadequate, coincidence is not necessarily causality. The book would have benefited from a comparative analysis of other cultures and times, as Fukuyama does in his &#34;Origins of Political Order...&#34;
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like this app a lot. Its always nice to have something to jot down things in to remember. Its very helpful.It also comes with a calendar.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|My daughter and I were avid followers of Smallville. When that was discontinued, there was nothing to take its place until this terrific series started. May it go on forever!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 7 year old son really loves Minecraft. He is very happy to have it on my Kindle fire. He likes it a lot.
6305212112|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. This movie is already a classic and is one that most will watch many times.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is simple and so addictive. if you are looking for a fun game this is it. not sure why it is so fun but it really is!
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Its hard to go wrong with this artist.  Great singer no matter what he sings.  Not sure if its what I expected as far as the songs on the CD but I liked it.
B000YHG72E|4.0|This is the most popular Christmas rental. We tried to get the DVD at the local video store but all they had was crappy VHS tape that was bad. We streamed this on our BlueRay for I think $2.99? Fun for my pre-teen daughters to watch, but still has too many gross jokes for younger children.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed the book; it was very thought provoking. The author presented some very different experiences than most people have in their life.
B005LAII3U|3.0|good movie!! I love it. <3 amazon rocks I love AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAZOOOON I doing this just to feel that I am doing something at work and in order to answer some questions
0451232852|5.0|Fall of Giants. I enjoy history.  Part of the story dealt with the country of Wales and all of my ancestors are from Wales.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I thought that I just didn't understand British television.  Turns out I was just watching the wrong shows.  This one is great.  I love how it shows that there is such a clearly defined hierarchy upstairs AND downstairs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its an outstanding timepass game .<br />and most lovely thing is its graphics. it seems that we are in the game wow, muah :p
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|it's there every morning, just as expected. Like an old twisted friend just waiting for you LOL. Don't get any better than that
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. Played all levels and intend to keep it on my device for quick access.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I found  the first 3rd of this book very slow & boring, but I carried on reading it because of all the good reviews or I would have put the book down. But after that I did get interested in the people & story line. Turned out very good, enjoyed it & will try the next book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can not put this book down. It has got to be one of my favorite trilogies. I can  not wait for the last book.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Really enjoyed this, Love anything English. Nice to have a story about older people for a change, Different & very funny! hope there are movies made like this
B005VPRFSY|5.0|My grandson loved this item, he played with it straight away, He was so excited when he seen what it was.
B00361CAEE|5.0|I've only recently become aware that these people exist and I was riveted.  Grace Coddington now ranks among my heroes, and as a fashion industry outsider looking in it was so fascinating to see her in action behind the scenes of the shoot.  Grace's shoot side-by-side with Mario Testino's was a masterful juxtaposition- Testino is the court jester to Anna Wintour's queen (Where is Grace in this image? Supreme Goddess in the clouds away from the nonsense below).  I think that the light Anna is cast in is a little harsh- I admire her self-confidence and calm.  While seemingly cool and nonchalant about her dismissals, I think it is important to remember that she has seen a lot and has selected people to provide the best possible material to work with.  She does know what she's doing, and she is not dismissive of many opinions of the also talented men and women that she hires.  She is honest in her praise and critiques.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|One of my favorite movies and it works like a charm. Love the document of the dead and the many othe documentaries and supplemental features as well as the movie
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I bought this movie for my mom for Christmas because it was the first Jane Austen book she read.  It's not the best version of this book, but it is very well done and very enjoyable.  So glad I found it!
B008XG1X18|4.0|works just like using on your computer. sharing and repinning are easy. love this app. recommend to anyone looking for easy and cheap DIY crafts
B0058YPL66|5.0|I bought this for a friend for Christmas and it was a very good gift idea.  The show is one of my favorites and hers also.
B0026O475M|5.0|Wilson!!!! :) It is an American classic. Tom Hanks is very good in this movie. Strongly recommended. Very exciting movie.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|For an MI episode the plot was right out of a Steven Segal movie from 1996.  As Maxwell Smart might say \\"the old steal the nukes from the former Soviet Union\\" scenario.<br /><br />If you ignore that the main premise has totally been done a gazillion times the action, thrills and cast interaction keep your attention.<br /><br />One thing lacking was the jaw dropping final chase sequence, but the actors somehow made up for it.  This almost might make a better TV series than a movie franchise if you could get them to reprise their roles on the small screen.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Me and my husband enjoyed watching it. The ending was a disappointment. It was an adult movie until the end and suddenly it turned to be a kid's movie with lots of miracles :) But still you can watch with joy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love it can't stop reading it! Looking toward to next book which I have already purchased ,can't wait for the movie!
0393338959|3.0|The broad outline of America`s fall from years of budget surplus during President Clinton, to record-deficits under the Bush Administration is well known.  Joseph Stiglitz's `Freefall' goes behind the headlines to explain the actions and motivations of the key players who set America on the slippery slope to penury.<br /><br />The distinguished economist explains how US policy makers ignored the warning signs; on how their dogmatic responses worsened the situation, and how those with the right connections took advantage to profit at the cost of the country.  At its core the crisis was the result of gross-mismanagement but ignorance, greed and chicanery too played a part in perpetuating the fall of the world`s biggest economy from surplus to bankruptcy.<br /><br />The book scrupulously avoids politicizing the issues, and thereby succeeds in providing a credible and factual account of the events. It is inevitable that personal opinions creep into the commentary while commenting on such broad-range of events, but on the whole the book stays focused on detailing the policy missteps that tripped the world's largest economy.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|The amount of editing you can do in this program is highly commendable. I don't know how to say that there is something i don't like about it. This is a must have for all kindle fire owners, enough said
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Fun game yet it's easy to play nothing too demanding.  It encourages you to try again and again with goals or just to beat your previous score
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I play this game with my kids. We try to beat each others high scores. I will admit that I am a bit addicted to this game!!!
159420411X|5.0|i AM STILL READING THIS BOOK AND AM LOVING EVERY MINUTE. SILVER BRINGS CALM TO ME AS A CONSUMER, MEDIA WATCHER AND ALL AROUND NERVOUS PERSON.
1442359315|5.0|At age 71, it was nice to know what to expect in the next few years.  This was well done, interesting,and certainly uplifting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was expecting an easy, entertaining read and was amazed by the plot twists and turns. I couldn't put it down.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Really like it a lot great alt to music downloads on kindle fire hd. thanks for ur easy free service. no issues so far.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I love Carrie Underwood's music. This album is no disappointment either. It is great and I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Slapstick comedy. Typical of Seth McFarland.  Although it is funny it doesn't leave you suprised in any ways.  A good watch.
B0083B3KOQ|1.0|which is why I bought it<br />ended up going to C-net and getting their freeware Jodix wma_mp3_converter worked like a charm am able to convert albums and even i-tunes (open on pc first) then load to kindle.
1423136802|5.0|It is a very interesting and compelling story.<br />I chose to buy this book after I learned about researching the same genre of books.<br />The setting is the fact that I liked to engage the reader's curiosity to the next pages. The point that I did not like is that it should have more pages and be more thorough, more this is not a problem because I think the book could become uncomfortable to finish reading.<br />I recommend this book to all.
B005HSL626|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much and it keeps my grandson who is six years old entertained for a long time and he gave it two thumbs up.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Growing up FRIENDS was my favorite television show. So after all said and done, I couldn't get enough so I had to order it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very challenging game that I found a lot of fun. My grandson who is six also likes to play this game and enjoys it and scores higher than me.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|I had to own all the X men movie, I love them, I can't have 1 without the others, so as long as they keep hitting to big screen, imma keep on buying them.  I wish they did a &#34;STORM&#34; Origins. Would love to see that, come on Hallie!
B004IK9CTS|5.0|This book is a great testament to the enduring relevance of Oscar WIdes writings even in the present day. Bravo to Mr. WIlde  !!!!!!!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|The overall picture was just ok.  With Clint Eastwood I expected more character development and more  substance in the storie itself.  The Actors just didnt seen to click like in alot of Eastwoods movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think the people who made this game were trying to make something like temple run because it kinda reminded me of it. It is not as fun, but its still lots of fun to play when you are bored.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is addictive. It is like a good thriller that you get into and can't put down,. It is well written and the stories are<br />believable and offer an insight into how life was like in that era  of aristocracy and those of the lower classes. It offered<br />little chance for a person to get out of the class they were born into. It also shows the place of women before we were<br />granted any rights to own property and to determine our own destiny. I highly recommend this series to anyone. Peg
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Historically correct in both scenery, manners and costume. Fascinating mix of characters and events that manages to be compelling without sinking into a sudsy morass or jumpimg any sharks..
B007NR9WBG|4.0|I can understand why the force behind the movie wanted to setup the aspect ratio so that the scenes portraying the virtual & simstim sequences appeared bigger. However the effect left me disappointed by what seemed like getting a dvd in 4:3 aspect ratio with occasional 16x9 performances.
B00633W614|5.0|there is such a good rundown of each person involved. I think that anyone would enjoy reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like this game very much.  It has a lot of different games to choose from and to try to better your score.  I would reccommend it highly.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was a very fun read and I really enjoyed it.  This book had a very good plot that I enjoyed.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It's not the same without Matt Damon but still just as good of quality and suspense. I'd watch it again.
0061765236|1.0|I bought a cheap kindle version of this book before I remembered that Jodi Picoult is the author of the hideous My Sister's Keeper...which left me swearing I would never read another of her books.  I can't believe almost 600 people have given this boring and unbelievable book 5 stars.  If you value your time, don't waste it on this trash.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I am always introducing my grandchildren to the classics I grew up with.  This is one of my favorite movies and is now a favorite of my 10 year old granddaughter as well.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|This is a neat maze game; you have to direct the mouse through the maze to get to the cheese. It is just a bit hard to get the hang of and maneuver through.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|The story of Jaycee Dugard, \\"A Stolen Life\\" can only be described as heart wrenching. Losing her youth, and her innocence to the worst kind of manipulative predator, Ms. Dugard tells in her own words how she grew and matured while in the confines of her captivity. Her ability to rise above circumstances that would have crushed many is inspiring and uplifting. Her story is riveting. A must read for anyone seeking understanding of the occasional perverseness of our society and the ability of truly strong and good people to overcome.[[ASIN:B00AUZD412 Eyes of the Predator: The Pickham County Murders (The Hunters)]]
B004V6X90W|5.0|Cary does a great job in this off beat movie. Very entertaining and worthwhile.<br />A true story and it is interesting what people are capable of with love as a motivator
B009MCRHH6|1.0|This is certainly a 4 or 5 star game, and I wouldn't usually judge it so harshly. I have to help balance out all the hype though. Not being able to turn off the sound is the deal breaker. Sure I can lower the volume of my phone, but what if I want to listen to an audio book or music while in play; impossible!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Book captured my attention instantly and couldn't put the book down!  It got me emotional and I became attached to the characters. Almost sad that there are no one  books to read!
B002TG3ACI|1.0|I was not made aware that the disk would only work in certain parts of the country because of the way it was made. So I wasted money on something that wouldn't play.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|My daughter enjoys playing with and storing her dolls in the Dream House Toybox and it makes for a good add-on with the Barbie Dream Townhouse!!!
B0092D1V5Y|5.0|this is good, I got into Scott and White wifi that has pass word so it does work I reccomemnd it
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I really liked that it did not take long to arrive. Thank you very much it is one great TV movie.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I can't wear the in the ear type headphones and don't like the big bulky ones so these always work great!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It is a good book about the struggles of middle school at home and at school. I think boys in the seventh grade would connect to this book the most if they are interested in girls yet. The ending is like you never expected.
B002Z5FM74|4.0|Dear Sir/ Madam<br />I love that item. It's good for my studied. I think it good usage for the student.<br />Thank you<br />From Sophat UN
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|...to the old Tom Clancy touch and feel.  Enjoyed this more than the past three by a longshot.  Some scenes drag on a bit but the weaving and unveiling of plot and suspense is vintage Clancy.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this app works as it says. the only thing it needs is a way to slide if your base computer has dual monitors.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I found the first part of the book to be unbelievably boring and slow, but I was glad that the &#34;boring phase&#34; didn't last that long, and once Harold begins his real pilgrimage, I was hooked. Charming, delightful and well worth reading.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I think this book is overarted but it has enjoyed a long time on the best seller list.  I would recommend it with reservations.
1451608659|5.0|Dominique Moceanu has been an inspiration from the very beginning to many young and old. With 'Off Balance: A Memoir', her fan base has grown an extreme amount. Thank you, Dominique, for sharing your story.
B006RED4GA|1.0|Nothing happens.  Much screaming from female lead who is startled by every event around her, though they consist only of encountering her co- worker and guests.  Maybe something happens eventually, but I couldn't hold out long enough.<br />Be bored: be very bored.<br />Actually, it didn't rate a whole star.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Must needed app for Kindle Fire HD. It opens up the Kindle Fire HD so you can see all the folders that are not available other wise. Good app to find Zino magazine so you can delete them and free up storage.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I was curious how the reboot to the original would go. I expected something more in line with the cable series that played back in the 90's. the setting was entirely on Earth, not Mars, and dealt with pretty much the same story of a secret agent who loses his memory and ends up working for the good guys. If you can handle the idea of a tunnel that runs through the world from England to Austrailia it was an entertaining two hours.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Best movie of 2012.  This movie is full of action with a great story. I love that all the characters are the same actors that were in their original movies. Highly recommend this movie. I cannot wait for the next one.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|I really like the characters in this series.  I feel like they could be my next door neighbors.  It was fun to see the changes in the children.
B004Y042N8|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining game. I can spend many hours playing this game, it is a lot of fun.
B004V2S4SS|5.0|I have enjoyed the prospect of this story line.  Who knows what mysterious &#34;talent&#34; someone might have.  The actors were all very believable.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This is s great family movie. it's hard to find good quality movies that are entertaining to the partners and the kids. It's nice that they kept all the same voices for the main characters.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|An interesting series in that the story line was always so varied.  Good acting and the &#34;costumes&#34; Hewitt wore were always very special.
B0012GTZFC|4.0|A practical, usable construct for working with organizations to help align values and improve culture and productivity.  The author's suggestions are backed by empirical evidence, which is  often lacking from &#34;self-help&#34; OD books.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I almost hate for this series to end.  It does stretch the imagination.  I haven't purchased all the seasons yet.  Waiting for a break in the price.
B00466HN6S|5.0|The whole family really enjoyed this movie! It will become a regular to watch in our house. Very appropriate for all ages to enjoy.
B00AF6B22E|1.0|Whats scarier than being in the car with a drunk driver? Being in an airplane piloted by an alcoholic / drug addict.  If it weren't for the decent acting job by Densel Washington & John Goodman, I would have given this movie 0 stars.  While the movie trailer gave the impression that this was a miraculous bit of piloting by another well trained and talented pilot like Captain Sully, that portion consisted of about 20 minutes of the entire movie.  The rest was about the destructive effects of drugs and alcohol addiction on a pilot's life who could have had it all, but instead flushed his life down the preverbal toilet.  If you want to be depressed and watch somebody destroy their life, then I would recommend this movie.  I can't imagine anyone buying this movie and watching it repeatedly.  I certainly NEVER want to watch it again.  Personally, I watch movies to escape reality & be entertained for a couple of hours or to learn something new & applicable, certainly not to feel worse than before I began watching. Unfortunately, that's exactly how I felt after watching this film.  Although, on that note, this movie would be good as a wake up call for those who do have addiction problems to see how it can destroy their lives.
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|My daughter in law just loves this movie. She was very happy to recieve it on Christmas. I didn't view it myself, but whoever has reall liked it.
B004I744AS|5.0|very good app it gives many different options such as Encyclopedia definition of the word, the audio read out and best of all it is free.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I think this book was great for a few reasons.<br />1. The plot of this story digs its hooks into you and doesn't let go from the first page to the last.Even when the main character is not fighting or training the actions he takes and how he interacts with everyone and everything is interesting.<br />2. The characters in this book are well thought out and you can sympathize with what they are going through in their lives. The characters are also not just blobs of people that anyone can replace with themselves to feel like their the main character.<br />3. The suspense in the story is just the right amount, it isn't so much that I just want to skip ahead, it's also not a small enough amount that I just don't want to keep reading it.<br /><br />These are the reasons why I think this book was good and I am eagerly awaiting the next book in the series.<br /><br />P.S If you are a fan of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series i would suggest this to you.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so much more than I had hoped. I was very skeptical when I bought it for the bargain price of $3.99. But it truly was a great read. There were so many huge surprises and I found myself incredibly bonded to the characters almost immediately. A really great read. Didn't realize it was written by Colleen Hoover until the end. I live her writing style!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is well written, with excellent acting.  I absolutely love everything about this series.  I can't wait to watch more.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|cool<br /><br />coolest? game I like driving the jeep. around trying. to catch. the animals but should have more gas to go longer. but it is still a lot of fun.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a great book, I loved the references to nineties ideals and music. Character was a unique mind to see out of, some parts of the story were hard to believe or relate to but overall a great read, especially for young teens going through highschool.
0891419063|5.0|I am reading a lot of books on WWII both the Pacific front and the European front.  Without a doubt, this is the best written book on WWII war, both at emotional level and at spiritual level.  What a kind human being.  If you believe in heaven, you would agree that he went to heaven.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch is back and in top form. Flynn never fails to deliver a thriller.  Mitch Rapp and Jack Reacher should meet.
074322454X|5.0|How could one not love it if you love Band of Brothers, the DVD?  Ambrose did a lot of research, and a lot of heart.  It covers a larger scope which the DVD could not cover.  Salute to Ambrose, the historian/biographer.  Without him, we would not have know all these good and brave solders.
B00633W614|4.0|Excellent read and I have pre- ordered the next volume. Interesting characters and setting in England. Hardto put down  family saga.
1567184855|1.0|If Michael Newton has a Ph.D. why didn't he publish the name of the college?  If he hides his credentials and his records, how can we believe anything he says?<br /><br />Granted if he is a psychic, he doesn't need degrees, but he does not show that.  In this case we need more research papers from him to substantiate his theories.  All his material came from regression, but he prompts his patients and fill thoughts and words into their mouths.<br /><br />If he believes in this and has his own institution, why hasn't he ask his colleagues to regress him and find out about his relationship with his wife/soulmate?<br /><br />Why does the new souls go to other simpler worlds, and not just be a simple animal in this world/earth?  Why all his souls gather around Middle East, Europe, or South America,  with European sounding  names, and none from Asia?<br /><br />My grandfather remembered his previous life and was substantiated, so I believe in reincarnation.  After reading Jenny Cockell's &#34;Across Time and Death&#34; where she found her children after remembering whole names of locations and streets with the help of regression, I believe in regression, but Mr. Newton's book just doesn't ring true.  Nothing to substantiate, no footnotes,<br /><br />Third, he prompts his patients during regression to help them out!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A definite must read! It is a very credible story of the passage into a new life after our human existence.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|The book was a great read!!!! Was not happy with the ending though. Really?!!!! In my opinion it kind of leaves you hanging.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Shinedown is an auto-buy for me. While this is not my favorite (Sound of Madness), it still has several songs that I do love.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was scared off by shades of grey. This book lured me back in with a love story and left a good cliffhanger. It's a MUST READ !!!
B000002ZR7|5.0|The CD arrived well packaged and padded, and had original wrapping on it.  Arrived quickly and am enjoying listening to it.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Just a great little movie to take you away from everyday stresses.  Just enough humor, action, and done with taste.
B001USHRCK|4.0|This is an awesome product; however, the part bags are not labeled. You have to dump out all the pieces and separate them into colors. Then you have to look at the directions and take extra time trying to find one tiny piece in a huge pile of parts. If I had to give an age range I would say 17+ it is very time consuming and difficult. The end product will be nice though.
0192853619|4.0|This book explains things very clearly with good analogies, but I wish it was a bit longer. When they say A Very Short Introduction, they arn't joking.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well written in a style mcGiver would have been proud to star in a modern sci fi tv series . Although at times Andy Weir takes a leap of faith in the reliability and adaptability of future technology - it a really good read  its up there with  both Arthur C  and  Boba and Anderson for me
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless turned out to be one of the best books I have read in a while.  I couldn't put it down- there was always something that I just had to find out what happened first and even after that, I would still read a little more.  I strongly recommend this book as well as other books by Colleen Hoover.
030758836X|5.0|Just when you think the plot is finished, Ms Flynn throws in another twist.  Very suspenseful and bizarre (in a good way) story.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|As above. The story line and plot had me in it's grip from the fist page. You feel like you really know the characters, and maybe do.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Kept me going and not wantint to put the book down. Would highly recommend to anybody who likes spy and action books.
B001GCUNYO|1.0|I purchased Taken on Amazon.com shipped and sold from them. My PS3 Slim [[ASIN:B0050SXNHO PS3 320GB Uncharted 3 Bundle]]and [[ASIN:B0009VXAM0 PlayStation 3 60GB System]] wouldn't read the disc at all yet they both will read other Blu-ray's, DVD's, and PS3 Games fine. This maybe could a bad batch that Amazon has. I am going to Best Buy tomorrow morning and buy a copy from there. I will update this review once I test Taken. Amazon.com customer service has really understanding of this issue.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|This movie was not nearly as good as the original three in the series as it did not come to a proper conclusion.
B007SGM084|5.0|COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  YES IT WAS SEXY BUT WAS WELL WRITTEN WITH A STORY YOU GET INVOLVED IN. WOULD LOVE TO READ MORE BY THIS AUTHOR.
B001NHNG64|3.0|I enjoyed the first Jack Reacher book so much, I knew I had to have this book.  Unfortunately, this one is not near as interesting and the character development is a bit lacking.  I'm not sure I will read anymore in this series after this one.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|as always Jodi Picoult handles tough topics in a way that really makes you think.  It also makes you look at things from all sides.  Well written with characters you become very invested in.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|What a great app!  It makes searches so easy and fun,  I give it ten stars for sure.  Get it you will see what I mean.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I chose four stars because it was convoluted.  But it did hold my interest and half way through I figured out some of the clues that made the story come together.  I would recommend it to those who like to read and my husband liked the way the story was told. He enjoys John Grisham's books.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|I didn't even bother reading the write up.  As soon as I saw this new Dr. Panda I ordered it and wasn't disappointed.  All the Dr. Panda's are awesome and even though I got it primarily for my 2 year old grandson, his 4 older brothers (even the 10 year old) love planting the different gardens.  The inter-activeness of all the Dr. Panda's keeps them occupied more than any other game.  I can't wait for the next Dr. Panda to come out.
B007L6VR6M|4.0|I bought it as a gift, and my wife loves it.  A quirky love story between two kids, and the mischief they get into is pretty funny.  Its a typical Wes Anderson type movie, and it is quite entertaining.
B004I4M0A2|1.0|This is a horrible app.  None of the categories worked.  They all said that no items were available at this time. Don't waste your time loading it.
B009ERK1T0|3.0|Deftones are getting older, and I do enjoy the creativity of the work the band puts out, but this album lacks the spirit I have always heard in the the albums before the Minerva album back in 2003.  I would still recommend any Deftones fan (such as I) to buy this album.  I can see it being one of those albums that one would find a couple years later as an amazing album.  Just not right now.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|I really enjoyed this version of the Phantom.  The music, by Andrew Lloyd Webber, is known and loved by everybody.  The film highlights the sexual attraction that Christine feels for the phantom and does an excellant job of showing the phantoms viewpoint- something other versions do not even attempt.  Overall, an excellant movie-one I think belongs in every movie lovers collection.
B003ELNV9Y|3.0|Although this seems to be a cobbled-together collection without a single theme, the bulk of the tunes here showcase Beck's late-career enamour with slow melodic  numbers, often show-tunes or classics.  He's been at this since the 60's, of course, but here it becomes the main focus.  Fine: he's still a magnificent guitarist, and the playing is outstanding, but I can't help wondering if we'll be listening to this stuff as we eat our porridge in the retirement home someday.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|This version of the Superman legend is truly enjoyable.  Brandon Routh does a good job playing the Man of Steel and Kate Bosworth plays a modern Lois Lane.  Kevin Spacey does not come up to snuff as Lex Luther, but the action sequences are very good.  Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|I was prepared to like a remake of the Arnold star-maker of the 80s. And I didn't mind the story changes at all, since I was expecting that.<br /><br />However, I didn't like the portrayal of the young Conan. This kid had a scowl on his face every time you saw him, and he looked at his father like he hated his guts. Is this how the director made the young Conan look tough? He looked like a juvenile delinquent who was mad at the world. So, of course, when he broke down when his father died, well, it seemed out of character.<br /><br />The two principal female characters always looked like they just stepped out of a beauty parlor, with lipstick and eye enhancement, especially the wicked witch, so not very convincing in their roles.<br /><br />But my major complaint was with the editing of the fight scenes, of which there are quite a few. I got a headache trying to follow the action. Oh, there was a lot of action and loud noise, and I normally like to watch a good fight scene, but not in this movie. When there was action, it was so fast that all I could see was a lot of movement. Mind you, I don't want to see the fight scenes in slow motion, but I felt the film editing was at fault. I understand some young movie fans like the action depicted like this, but I can't imagine why. It reminded me of some of the terrible previews of today, with fast-action biff-bam-boom in every scene, and if you blink your eyes you miss it.<br /><br />And I missed an intriguing villain like James Earl Jones, and the rousing background music by Basil Pouledouris was definitely a plus in the original. And I thought there was too much gratuitous violence, with blood spattering everywhere, in this version of the Conan story.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw it in a DVD borrowed from the library. I would definitely be angry if I paid good money for this. Too bad for the actor, in a way.  The original made Arnold's movie career, but I don't think the Conan-portrayor in this movie will have the same luck..
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Crime drama is a very successful formula type. All you have to do is look at the long-running CSI and Law & Order series, and their spin-offs to see just how true it is.<br /><br />Some background: This is a very creative variation on the genre. Throw in a successful mystery writer (Richard 'Rick' Castle) with a satiric sense of humor, a detective (Kate Beckett) who considers him an extreme inconvenience, and a mayor who is a great fan of Richard's books.<br /><br />Rick needs inspiration for his new series. He talks to the mayor and the mayor saddles Beckett with Castle. Kate is less than pleased with this arrangement but has no choice and, after all, it is just for one book. One crime, one book. Right?? Nope. The book happens and the mayor loves it and, much to her dismay, Rick becomes a feature in her homicide investigations.<br /><br />When we get to Season 5 we have a blooming romance that Rick's daughter is in favor of. An ex-wife (and Rick's publisher) that wants to make Rick's life more interesting and, of course, more homicides.<br /><br />I don't want to give any specifics, this is a series you have to see. Never tuned in? Buy the seasons and catch up. It is well worth the bucks you pay. And Castle is one of the less expensive Video on Demand TV seasons out there. Just $14.99 for the first season. Just 10 episodes. Just enough to hook you. Wonderful entertainment. (Trust me)
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed Books 1 & 2 more than 3, but overall they were all well written and kept me wanting to continue reading.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great, fun,  addicting. Can not put it down.  I am already on level 3. It was free but I would have paid for the game.-
B009GEDP26|5.0|Still fun even though the 'will they/won't they' tension is resolved.  Still quirky.  Still hilarious.  The writing is as snappy as ever, and they characters continue to grow.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|This is a great film! Sooo much better than the re-make. It scares the hell out of me!! Don't let the subtitles put you off!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is epic!<br />I would buy this game if I were you.....however I already bought it...this is a funny sentence hahaha lol
B0065GC0BA|4.0|The first half of this book was a pleasant read. It wasn't until half way through that I started to really enjoy it!<br />If your'e into romance and like a little cry during a book then this is for you.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always a thrill a minute.  Do not miss this one if you love tom clancy and the whole experience
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved this book so much I read it twice and cried both times. Sam and Grace 's story is so good. It about first loves and how innocent it is.  I am so happy that the first copy I read was given to me when I went to the movies, that when I got my Kindle I bought it again to read. I can't wait to read Linger
B00003CXHJ|4.0|Highly recommended for those who are into war flicks. Good suspense, Will watch it for years to come I'm sure
B0025VLEM0|5.0|Just one of my favorite flicks. I think you should see it - especially if you're a zombie fan. So many good lines.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It was one of Nicholas Sparks'  best books.  I had a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />A wonderful story.  So romantic!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I wanted something else to play. I choose this game because I like Mahjong, it's great. Haven't quite figtured it out, I'm still learning.
1423140605|5.0|My son read the book and really liked it so I read it too.  I thought it was very well written.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I needed the last episode of season 3 2012. Did not disappoint. Great way to catch on on occasional missed episodes.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|The quality of the movie was great, crisp and clear. Action wise, in my opinion, it was better than the previous Judge Dredd movie.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I like the storyline and the puzzles are challenging but not impossible. Usually I finish games in a day which gets expensive but this one is taking longer to do. Worth the money.
B009O2XY12|1.0|Not worth the money you spend on it...and it's free!!! Unloaded it a couple days after uploading the apt. Had to restart my fire several times when this program froze it up. Just not worth it to me.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|perfect gift for the Zeppelin fan and will be watching for more opportunities to purchase more excellent music from the recent past
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|When I can get the fire away from the wife who's loves this game I find this to be an entertaining and thought provoking game. Pop up ads are ht only draw back but heck it was free so it was worth the money...play on.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Exactly the gift requested by the grandkids...they loved it and will give more hours of entertainment...will watch for more excellent movies in the future
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Humanity, apocalypse, courage, conviction all in a science fiction. It has not been since the foundation series that I have wanted to read an entire series in one go.
B000YHE4AG|3.0|actually ordered the blu-ray edition and tried to return this order.<br />not successful<br />not the seller's problem... will watch and verify before submitting the orders in the future
B00APUQKDG|3.0|This seemed like a cool movie at first,nicely shot but preview led me to believe rioting was near the end,witch it is not.This movie seemed to lose something nearing the end,perhaps its just me but I wouldnt have put the lead guy in such a trashy dump apartment talking with a man who wants to kill him.His limo is his office and nearly an apartment.Most of the movie is shot around that limo ... very cool on the inside,different people coming to see him ,strange relationship with what may have been his wife.Worth seeing but not for 5$ - but that is for 3 days.Some brief nudity ,acting was good,HD was nice ,I just think ending scene in trashy apt. was to long. I was wishing these guys would just shoot each other already... It just died quietly
B00003CX9W|5.0|We love fantasia! I'm so glad we purchased this so that our children can watch it like my husband and I did as children. Fantasia never gets old
B0064T6LV8|5.0|EXCELLENT ALL THE WAY!!!!!  i WILL SHARE INFO WITH MY COULD NPT BE MORE RELAXING THAN A  YSTUDENTS!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
B0098VXE50|5.0|great buy, great price fast delivery what more can one ask for...love the deals for movies, it was cheaper than what i found in stores
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is good because it covers everything that you would think I will happen in a real zombie apocalypse, including the aftermath of the whole war
B002UZCJ8Y|1.0|Worst Bruce Willis movie that I've ever seen.  Very dissapointing.  I do not recommend spending money on this movie. .
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I had seen an interview with author as well as having read a brief excerpt fro the book.  I thought that between the two that the excitement and mystique had been revealed -- wow, was I wrong!  I absolutely could not put the book down.  Anyone who loves WWII history, especially about the Army Air Corp and the Luftwaffe, will find this book extremely enjoyable.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Good reading but story line is very similar to 50 shades of Grey - even characters. Have pre ordered the last in the series.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Witty and lighthearted banter between the protagonists, and the clever twist of having a writer who sees the crimes as part of a story set this show apart from other crime dramas. Rick's relationship with his daughter gives him a degree of humanity needed to keep him from being totally arrogant.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Good reading but story line is very similar to 50 shades of Grey - even characters. Have pre ordered the last in the series.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|great book.  i love clancy have read all his books and this is really interesting and current with todays events
B0092C2X7U|4.0|At first, i coodnt figure out how to play the game. But once i did, its actually kinda cool n fun. It takes patience and a little skill. I beat the demo n now i wuna buy the full version. It gets harder but games r spose 2. This game is a challenge n if u like a challenge, get it. If u dont hav mch patience, dont get it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed the entire book. I wonder why iyt seems to be a trend to include ghosts in recent love stories I have read. I'm not a big fan of that part of this book but it wasn't enough to not enjoy the story...
B0014CDKVY|4.0|Spoiler Alert!<br />While the movie veers from the book, (especially in the ending), this is perhaps the best post apocalyptic movie that I've seen in years, if not ever. Will Smith portrays a scientist who was responsible for finding a cure to a virus that had spread throughout the world.  This virus turned people (and animals) into a type of Zombie/Vampire. Unfortunately the good doctor didn't find the cure and civilization was pretty much destroyed.  I love that they showed a typical day in the life of this doctor. While the movie is packed with action created by the zombie/vampires, it takes the time to show how he survives from day to day. His existence is better than most survivors that are portrayed in these types of movies until an event occurs which throws him into a careless rage bringing his carefully crafted existence into dire jeopardy. I also love the zombie/vampire creatures.  They are quick, incredibly scary looking and intelligent.  They are the scariest virus victims of any movie that I've ever seen. I truly hope if anything like this ever occurs in real life that the monsters are nothing like the ones depicted in this film!  I am hoping for the slow, unthinking, unintelligent zombie of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; or &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34; - certainly not the kind depicted in this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a while. True and believable characters. Great depth to the plot and true feelings show through the entire book. I couldn't put this one down. You won't be sorry if you get it...just be ready to read it straight through!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This show could be on for 100 seasons and none of them would ever compare to the first season.  Andrew Lincoln and the rest of the cast do a more than superb job of portraying a rag tag group of survivors learning how to stay alive and maintain their humanity in a world full of &#34;walkers&#34; (zombies).  I love that they don't explain how or why this apocalypse happened and that they don't waste screen time filling us in on the characters background ad nauseum.  They give us just enough info to form an opinion and then move on to the storyline.  There's nothing I don't like about this show.  Love it!
B004I744AS|5.0|Finds the word fast and offers options and a thesaurus with many other options. Word of the day is fun and the other info is good as well if you have time to read it when opening.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I love dystopian novels and the concept of Delirium doesn't let down. The in depth characters draw you into a world where it is actually illegal to love. The journey of Lena is exciting, heart breaking and surprising. This is a new favorite. Don't forget to read Hana after you read Delirium to see even more into the world of Delirium!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book! Slow at first going through the characters, but picks up & is hard to put down! Definitely a good read!
0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis does a good job on showing us what happened during the mortgage crisis. He shows who the different players were and their motives behind the decisions that were made. You don't necessarily have to be a finance person to understand the book but it will definitely help. The book is fast pace and moves on to the next situation quickly. I recommend the book if you are interested in the learning about the 2008 financial crisis.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|David Lean's classic film is restored to perfection in the Blu ray release of Lawrence of Arabia. Here, the colors are sharp and vibrant when called for, and the muted shades of the desert are so detailed you can almost feel the desert heat and the shifting of the sands. A new life for a film made in 1962. Audio hasn't been neglected, with a 5.1 DTS HD Master soundtrack that envelops you with the genius of Maurice Jarre's timeless score. In addition to the film, there are worthwhile extras and exclusive to the Blu ray edition, a remembrance of Lawrence of Arabia by Peter O'Toole. This is the best way to enjoy one of the best films ever made in a home environment!
B00006JKON|5.0|My first Jethro Tull Concert was The War Child concert.  It was incredible!!!!  I was truly amazed!  I wore out my vinyl LP long ago.  My 30+ year old cassettes are getting there, too.  It was time to replace the LP.  As a side note, I enjoy Jethro Tull music so much I named my sons after members of the band.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Excellent story, acting and directing.  The picture looks beautiful on Blu-Ray.  I lived my whole life on the west coast so never had to deal with this issue.  Was interesting to see how bigotry was so prevalent in the south.  Glad to see things have improved over the years.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book, It really took me on a wild ride in my imagination. At some point it made me blush an I'm not a blusher. Loved it!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|For the most part this book was pretty enjoyable. The female lead had an interesting background as a card shark and the male lead was involved in underground fighting on college campuses.The book flowed really well and I enjoyed the build up of the relationship between the H&H. However, the over the top aggresiveness and jealousy of the male lead was a little off putting. There was even a point in the story where the female lead was afraid of going near the male lead because she didn't want to be the first girl he hit. Like another reviewer, I really wanted them to stop fighting and enjoy being together.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I purchased the J K Rowling book the last of Sept and didn't get around to starting it until yesterday. Kindle purchase. It is a filthy book and so negative. I know it is to late to return, but I would like to register a protest. When I got to the page that had the f word on it three times, I stopped reading it. What an awful book from an author I deemed to be safe.  What an unworthy effort from a great author.  I gave it one star because the software would not let me out without at least one.  It is unworthy of even one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really good book. Now, I want to read, her other books. Very happy I started with this one.  Good read
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Most definitly one of my absolute favorite movies ever. I have read the book and they do a great job bringing the story to life and putting you right in the middle of it.
B008JIFJ4W|1.0|Amazon recommended this CD after I purchased Alanis Morissette's \\"Thank U.\\" Frankly, each and every track is too disorganized and muddled. The album lacks rhythm and sounded entirely like a mashed up, multitude of chaotic trance garbage playing simultaneously. The lyrics try to sound profound, but are really just shallow, unpoetic, puerile trash. Pre-teen Nicki Minaj and the Insane Clown Posse wrote better songs in middle school. And the stuttering here gets worst. This album does not belong in raves, concerts, parties, or my house. \\"Pit\\" because this is a nightmare.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie has a great message and I highly recommend it. We take our kids for granted at times and this movie really points out that they are a gift from God and that we are charged with taking care of them as such. I really enjoyed the acting d the chemistry between them. I highly recommend this movie!
0765325950|5.0|While I'm never happy about a series ending, especially one as good as this, I could not have asked for anything more. This book was everything I hoped it to be, and I look forward to reading it again and again.
B007ZLKK9I|4.0|My sister recommended it to me as we are big Beatles fans. It has opened up a new world of music to me long since passed.
B004Y042N8|5.0|This game is simple, period. Don't expect 3D images, music or great sound effects. This is a simple, but smart and well designed game that fits its purpose. I have been playing it two days so far and I have not get bored while I have had the time to play it. I recommend it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|We got this as a gift for my brother for Christmas and he loved it! This was all three movies on Blu-ray! The price was phenomenal. We even shopped around but couldn't find a better price!. We paid around $30 for it.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I'm a huge fan. I think I prefer this series to the fifty shades. It had more plot than the previously mentioned series I'm keen to read the next one.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great horror story!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat!  I could watch this series more than once.  Awesome
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was different from other books that are currently out there. I enjoyed how it was written in a letter format. It gave the feeling that the main character was a real person. Would highly recommend.
078401213X|5.0|I really enjoyed very entertaining movie, &#34;Pi&#34;. Excellent concept of trying to decode the stock market which leads the main character Sean Gullete on a succession of misadventures in his attempt to crack the code.
1609611543|5.0|This was an eye opener.  There was a lot more &#34;scientific&#34; information that I just skimmed through.  But, after reading all the information he described, I have not only cut way back on gluten products, but other  gluten-free products as well.  Trying to share this information with other people is hard.  They don't want to hear it.....but this is a must read.  Try to pass it on if you can.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Don't know how they lived through it and wrote such great music. Fascinating read. Well written and informative on an emotional level.
B008MM9630|4.0|i like that this game is very well made in addition to the fact that it doesnt require the internet to play. the graphics are decent  it doesnt run very slow like some games on the kindle fire. I think the game is pretty the only drawback isnits time consuming you have to wait hours and hours and hours on end to get some of the plants to grow... but its free so hey...
B007SGM084|1.0|This book was interesting at first, but the author needs to re-think the whole author idea. The same phrases over and over, I ended up skimming, looking for a plot, anything, to keep my interest. I mean, how much can you read about sex? And kinky? Let's face it, that's only scratching the surface.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|No search page or table of contents ,I was not pleased by this dictionary. Plus I couldn't understand most things it said.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|This book was interesting in patches, but why so long? what is it about this author for long winded books? just not enough to carry the length, though a great premise.
B006FKEQS6|5.0|I installed it and it workd very well.  A good price and good fit.  I will keep ordering  from my printer.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I wanted something cheap to replace ear-buds that required a headband to stay in.  These work fine, and the sound is good enough for me.  I don't know how they will last long term.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This application is great for checking how much battery life is left. It also notifies you when you are low so you'll have time to take care of unfinished business and sign off. Nice to have!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|One of the best books that I have read in a long time!  In fact I couldn't put it down until I finished.  Just  about the time I thought I knew where the story line was going, it changed.  Again, Great book!
B008518MOW|4.0|Good movie.  If you have enjoyed the other 2; this one is more a background story.  Not as many cool aliens.  But LOTS of GREAT special effects.  Pop some popcorn, grab your 4-D glasses and hit the couch, it's a fun movie.  The ending explains everything.
B00422LESO|5.0|This was such a wonderful book!  I would love to be able to go to such a place!  It is a great book for Austen fans!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Great love story mixed with deep sorrow and loss. Colleen Hoover has a way of capturing her readers with the 1st paragraph and this story is no different.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love the product can use it on my cell, kindle fire 7 work and home computers. it syncs auto and fast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing the best game ever better then temple run which I thought was impossible just a couple word you have to download this gamea
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I read this book in a night and loved it. It had a perfect blend of action and mystery. It some ways it reminded me of my name is Asher lev.  It describes the creation of a masterpiece, a masterpiece that happens to be a human soul.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I'm such a sucker for good romance and this book will be one of my favorites. The end was a little rushed but over all amazing book.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is by far one of the best TV shows currently shown on TV.  Season One is a great start to being drawn into the mind of a character you learn to like and love threwout the whole season of the show.  But for fans of the Dexter Series I will give you guys and ladies highlights of the season but not giving anything away for those who have yet to watch this show. Dexter is a cop working crime scenes blood splatter, a dead body comes along drained of blood Dexter becomes very intrested in the story behind it.  The cops dub the killer \\"The Ice Truck Killer.\\"  Threwout the season Dexter keeps the code he was taught alive by killing the bad people.  As the season progresses the killer ups his game and leaves more clues for Dexter to find.  Dexter feels a storm coming as the season gets closer to the end.  He does more research into the clues left for him by the killer and dives into the past his past to learn more about his real family.  Dexter keeps having flashbacks to his mother's death making his job harder to do, but starts to realize the connection and draws up theories about the killer and what the clues mean to finding out the truth for himself.  In doing so finds out his mother's name and address, goes to meet the killer and the killer has a surpise for dear old Dexter.  If you desire to know more order the first season of Dexter and watch the end for yourself because it even shock me as I watched it.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Marketed for teens but  a great read for all ages. If you liked the Percy Jackson or Rangers Apprentice series you'll love this book! Can't wait for book 2 to be released.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I want more... when does the next set of books come out. And PLEASE, DO NOT let HOLLYWOOD KILL THIS AS A MOVIE!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love being able to put in different zip codes for different areas of the country where I have friends and family living and being able to compare them to where I live
B0070NSPCU|5.0|It could do with a proof-read, since there are a few inconsistencies in the text (ie. which Order is which).  Other than that, this is a very entertaining read.  I can't wait for the next one.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have a different version of this game on both my laptop and desktops and find that playing this on my Android is slightly difficult.
B005CRQ4OW|2.0|It is not the kind of reading I like, but I am sure it is entertaining for pre-teens that are living similar experiences and tribulations of the middle school years
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Arguably Dustin Hoffman's pinnacle achievement as an actor.  The story is wonderfully told and the film is extremely well directed.  However, in some parts it does seem cut a bit too much, perhaps to obtain a particular length.  Some scenes could have been developed a bit further.  Overall, however, a masterpiece and one of the best movies of all time.
B00631HASU|5.0|Really good game. Helps pass the time. Many levels and different options to choose from, free play, quest, etc. U gave enjoyed it a lot
030759565X|5.0|Have already found several recipes to try - resonates with me.  Well organized and well written. Would certainly recommend this cookbook.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|the doctors sonic screwdriver was a very fun toy/collectible but the plastic is fragile and cant take more than two drops on the floor and the emitter tip Broke first drop the the second drop the wires to the wire and the sound chip riped and it no longer works but over all it was very fun
B008OM0M4U|1.0|I really like some of Sascha Cohen's other films, but this one was just awful to watch.  The jokes are so silly and the plot is just dumb.  I could barely get through this boring film.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Is one of the all of the game I have this one have a great mystery like a mini movie. I love it need more like this.
B00012QM8G|5.0|One of the best films of the 20th Century about a flawed man and humanity.  There are many other editorial reviews and descriptions of the movie here so I didn't feel the need to write another one.  The disc came packaged well in a plastic dvd case.  This is a double-sided disc so you'll flip about 2/3rds of the way through the movie.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|As good a voice as there is...she is my favorite voice in music...<br />Her most interesting album since her debut
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was earie.  I guess there are people out there like Kevin, but they should all be destroyed.  It was spell binding.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All I can say is Wow!!  This really is such a great, romantic story..  I'm pleasantly surprised!!!  I teared up a few times.... . Can't wait to read the last book....
B00336G7HI|4.0|I read where this V-Series battery replaces the H-Series but it says right on the front of the package \\"Not compatible with Cyber-Shot\\" so I had to return it.<br /><br />FYI, I used the Sony Battery Charger BC-TRP to charge it.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|first movie was better. same fight moves, old actors trying to stay in the game. could of been better. h
B005KELQEU|5.0|Purchased this for my wife for Christmas.  I read the reviews before purchasing and agree that the original Kindle works better with this protective sleeve since it so light weight.  She loves having it for protection when we travel.
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|same fight scenes; the whole time it remained in a simulation orbit and no exposure to the outside world, got a little boring.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|this movie is a loose adaptation of the book it's based upon. when watching it i had to detach myself from much of what happened in the novel it was based upon in order to enjoy it as a film. much of the politics and the beauty of the world created by riordan in the series was lost in the transition to film and it seemed to lack the magic that went along with that world in the novel. one thing i think it did well was keep the overall personality of the characters (though they are made older in the film) intact. i do, however, think it failed as an attempted adaptation and hope that the future films in the series will improve in that regard.<br /><br />once i was able to let go of how it differed from the novel i found it to be a fun adventure! good effects and impressive acting from the seasoned supporting cast and the young lead actors alike made it an enjoyable and easy watch. it was fairly fast paced and definitely amusing. my family who hadn't read the novels loved it very much on its own and some of them are even wanting to pick up the books now! if anything, you've got to thank the movie for that.<br /><br />i would recommend that fans of the series watch it, just not with expectations held too high.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|For myself I don't care how care how good a plot is if the acting isn't good. The acting on here is epic! I love it!
B0012GMZ5E|5.0|Second Winter is the third studio album by Texas Blues guitarist Johnny Winter, released in 1969. This one ranks up there with his [[ASIN:B0000009YH 3rd Degree]] album  as two of his better blues releases.<br /><br />Johnny's Personnel at the time...<br /><br />Personnel<br /><br />Johnny Winter..guitar, mandolin, vocals<br />Edgar Winter..keyboards, alto saxophone, vocals<br />Uncle John Turner..percussion<br />Tommy Shannon..bass<br />Dennis Collins..bass<br /><br />Tommy Shannon would later hook up with SRV and become half of the legendary \\"Double Trouble\\" with Chris Layton.<br /><br />This album rocks the house from the foundation to the rafters. All original blues numbers with a couple covers of Little Richard's and Chuck Berry's and his Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited.\\" With the aid of his brother Edgar the traditional blues and roots rock-oriented style that Winter would pioneer in the mid 1970's is still alive and kickin'.<br /><br />I caught Johnny live back in 1976, I believe it was, when he performed his \\"Captured Live\\" tour with Suzy Quattro opening for them. What a concert that was, I can still remember it to this day. Johnny and Rick trading back and forth. The mid seventies belonged to Johnny.<br /><br />Johnny is something special. This album rocks.
B00ARN0XGG|5.0|very chilling bone chilling scary and I'm a big guy<br />You must view this film I think it's a must see.<br />You will be happy and it's worth the time.

B002PQ7JQK|4.0|Crystal-clear blu-ray versions of all 79 episodes of the Original Star Trek, with both the remastered special effects and the original versions as aired - what more could you ask for? Thousands of others have reviewed these episodes, so I'll just add: there's little to complain about here. Special features are decent, the transfer from the original film to Blu-Ray is great, and watching the episodes with new special effects brings out a new dimension. Negatives: while the packing is sturdy, you have to remove discs to see the lists of episodes, as they're printed on the inside cover of the box, hidden by the discs. And, in the 3-set I received, the Season 3 box is slimmer than Seasons 1 and 2, so it looks odd on the bookshelf. But those are minor quibbles - this is the ultimate edition, until whatever format replaces Blu-Rays.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|They need to update this app. It won't even let me take a video on it. Only pictures. The app used to let me take videos on it but all the sudden it won't!!!
B004ZJZQJC|3.0|This was never a great movie, and it hasn't aged well. Still, it's a moment in cinematic history, when it was thought that cheesy CGI effects could carry a flick, even if they were far from realistic. It's the ultimate in teenage wish fulfillment: playing a video game lets you save the galaxy and get the girl.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is not just one more Account of a near death experience. This is by far the most  dramatic and convincing account by a brain surgeon, who did not have strong spiritual beliefs before his experience. He tells his story and also scientifically refutes all the &#34;scientific&#34; explanations about why his experience cannot be real.  All his doctors agree that he is a medical miracle. You have to read this weather you are a religions person or not. It's very well-written and very inspiring. I could not put it (my Kindle) Down once I started it. There is also a u-tube video of Dr. Alexander being interviewed that gives you a taste of what is in the book. This book helped me to a deeper understanding some of my own spiritual beliefs.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Why buy something when you can watch it on-line for free? In this case, for the special features, including a musical commentary track. And Dr. Horrible and Captain Hammer just look that much better in High-Def Blu-ray. A funny, touching film - just be aware, it's on the short side.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so much cooler then the free version. I love it so much. Especially survival. There are lots of monsters so be careful
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Fun for a few minutes.  loses its play value quickly.  the game is exactly what the description said it would be. Chase cheese avoid the cat.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show. It is fun, light, and good does always win. :)) please tell all of your friends.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very well written. Thought provoking. I remember the day Kennedy was shot, so I could related to the time period.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I found Adele on my own. I had never heard of her and one day was listening to the radio (which I rarely do - I have my own music already loaded on my i-phone). When I heard her voice, I felt like crying - Of course I had to find out who she was and there she is. I wish her all the best. She gives it her all and she moves me in such a positive way or a sad way but she is my favorite artist. Her lyrics are also brilliant.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I have had mine for a year or two now and it is by far the best transmitter I've had as far as signal strength goes. The signal is so strong that I once pulled into a gas station and my transmitter had hijacked their radio signal. However mine just died, and I felt like for the price I paid I should have gotten a few more years out of it. The neck of the device is starting to limp and it will work for maybe 20 minutes before the transmitter just dies and stops broadcasting entirely. I've replaced the fuse etc but it doesn't fix it. I'd give this 4-4.5 stars, I really just wish it has lasted longer...it's fairly expensive. I'll probably buy another one because FM transmitters are such a gamble when it comes to signal strength.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|I kept seeing fairly good reviews on this and so I pushed myself to complete season 1.  It was okay.  But this Asylum Season 2 was much better with a talented star-studded cast.  I would say it is on the campy side of fun/entertaining.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This was not what I expected it to be and not for me, we will delete this product that is why I rated one star.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book. As a 10 year old in 1963 I remember November 22 1963 like it was yesterday. This book was good.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It works like it should & a necessary app.  Nothing else needs to be said about this app...Adobe. Reader so there.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|After having seen the movie listening to the music takes me right back to the movie and being able to relive it in my mind.  I highly recommend it for anyone that liked the movie in any way.  I didn't think I did like it at first, but as time went on I realized I like it more than I knew and after getting the music I liked even more.  So that says something about the soundtrack.  Hopefully that helps someone.
B001LX2J22|5.0|I love Anthony Hopkins, and his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is masterful and engrossing.  This movie is a prequel to Silence of the Lambs, and explores the relationship between Dr. Lecter and Will Graham, the FBI agent who captured him.  Graham has retired from the FBI  but they ask him to come back for &#34;one last case&#34; in which the serial killer seems to be targeting families.  Ralph Fiennes is a great choice to play the &#34;Red Dragon&#34; and his skill makes you almost feel sorry for him.  His relationship with the blind woman played by Emily Watson is both revealing and very sad, and gives you hope that he can be redeemed.  Edward Norton is fantastic as the FBI agent and his journey because of Dr. Lecter is intriguing as well.  This movie has many twists and it really keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You won't be disappointed!
B000FC1LOC|3.0|This novel deals with a family's experience that is undoubtedly quite rare.  The characters are presented in a way that you hear each person's viewpoint, though it is not always understandable.  The subject matter is depressing, the characters are depressing, and the resolution is worse.  I did not like this book, but give it three stars because it is well executed.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Found it a bit boring but was encouraged to keep going as it would get better and it did. Would recommend it as a trilogy to adults.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|very happy with them like how the 4 movies came on 2 disk already have had to loan them to friends to watch
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Movie was awesome, so many things that connect together and you don't even realize until you watch it twice. Must watch!
B0085WA9OM|5.0|Bought Graceland years ago.  Some of my favorite songs were on it.  After watching the Paul Simon revisits Graceland special on PBS I knew I had to have it for my Kindle.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Very go book. I really enjoyed it that's the live. I  dream about. I can wait to read the next one
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book. Ms. Hoover is a brilliant storyteller.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a story about hope and the healing power of love.<br /><br />Simply an amazing read.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I was amazed at the quality of acting by such young actors in this movie. A real bonus on top of this great story is the incredible soundtrack. I had seen the movie before but liked it so much I wanted to add it to my permanent collection of DVDs.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love Colleen Hoover!  Loved Slammed & Point of Retreat. Hopeless did more than satisfy my need for another sweet love story. Like her first 2 books, this story is about loyalty to someone you love so deeply!  It's not flakey romance or games, it's what true love is supposed to be.....and it's just the right amount of steamy (and tasteful) which is what you get when you're a young adult and in love!  Well written!!  LOVED IT!!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Too slow...wants you to pay money...wants you to use facebook...unoriginal...but probably one of the best tokens of its type...decent graphics
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|This movie would certainly have to be placed in my all-time favorites.  It is a touching story focused around a young boy's year of doubt.  I purchased this movie on my Kindle for my two-year old grandson and he is mesmerized every single time he watches it.  Out of all the movies we have watched together, this one is the ultimate.  We both Love it.
B0012GMVSU|5.0|We drove to Kentucky the first of the week, and played our CD the majority of the time.... we love Tom Hanks and the CD Forest Gump.....<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Vickie Williams
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Kept my interest, very fast read. I'm a big fan of the Kay Scarpetta stories An ending that was unexpected.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing book that was just so cool for me to read  my kids enjoyed it to the max amazing book
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I purchased this on the recommendation of a few friends and it was very fun to play with family. We will probably be purchasing the expansion to six players next as there are a lot of players who enjoy this game.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was such an enjoyable book, and my first read on a kindle.  I loved the dictionary feature of the Kindle, because in this case the story is set in England so the use of the language at times was unique.  It is a wonderful story and inspiring-get out of our ruts!  And its a story I can recommend to friends who are younger, as well as my mom's generation.  I won't be embarrassed discussing anything in the book. It is a well written story.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Bought in error as it did not say it was included with the kindle.  In the cupboard as a spare
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my favorite books and I love it it is wonderful and I think the words are perfect for this doom
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have used AVG for years it had found virus that my other program didn't ,I ma sold on this program and best of all it free.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked this book because it gave me all the exact definitions of all the words i had looked up i chose all five stars cause it was a magnificent book  and i am extremely happy to have been a reader of the new Oxford American dictionary
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|It made me crazy that I didn't record this on tv.  I couldn't move forward without it.  Loved that I instantly had it and the quality was perfect.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A tortuous and unpleasant trek to an un satisfying  ending.  Nevertheless, the author kept me reading to the end...hence a begrudging third star.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book,the twist in the middle had me hooked! I couldn't put it down. I finished in 2 days time
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Amazon does not have an updated version of this app available through  its Marketplace. If you want the most up to date features, purchase through Google Play.
B00A3SGWYC|5.0|I am such a fan of Pitbull and although I wanted to buy the extended version of jhis album it's ok , cuz I gave his sings on my Ipod for my workout routine, The sound is clear and I love music !!!!!
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Just the drums and synths alone make this album worth it, everything else is a happy bonus, from the odd vocals to the noodly guitar lines you are instantly drawn in and kept busy for the length if the album.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Book keeps you guessing all the way through.  Can't wait to try another one of her books.  Plus I love my Kindle books, fast deliveries
0425263908|5.0|It make one day dream about the possiblties of finding a love so powerful that you feel it in the air makes one wish they can find a Mr Cross to some where, and I look forward to reading more books by Sylvia Day
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nice features.  Can handle larger amounts than most calculators.  Memory buttons change to add features is nice. Wish there was an Ad free version.
0425263916|5.0|It make you feel like going to nyc and see if you find a Gideon Cross, I hope she write more books I have read my books a few times and I am looking for something else to read
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved this book<br />So much it was great and has such a. Great story line and I can't wait for the next one
B0076DELIG|3.0|Too many characters were caricatures rather than characters.. The detective work was plodding, rather than creative, but it was still one of his better recent works.
B006P4FBUE|4.0|Pros:<br />Works well for selecting notes quickly.<br />Intuitive interface - easy to use.<br /><br />Wish list:<br />Cannot play a cord, intervals only.<br />Wish it would also work in portrait mode (at least on a Kindle fire).
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read any Stephen King books in quite a few years.  This was the first one. I was not disappointed.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I had no idea what I was missing out on.  Great for Call of Duty, these alone have improved my game!  Cordless would be nice, but not worth the extra money
B009JZTOG8|2.0|1st season...great! all tied in with  each tale  tying back to the main theme...<br />This season....if i wanted a soap opera i wouldnt work
B005WUHAX8|3.0|The premise of this product is great. I liked the color and the lack of bulkiness. However, when a phone call was made, it was hard for the other person to hear me unless I put them on speaker or opened the charger cover and spoke into that. I contacted customer service twice, and after being on hold both times for a significant amount of time, I was told there was no problem with the product. I decided to return the product and try a different product to protect my phone
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I normally don't care for this type of book.  But this one is well-written and keeps you interested in the plot through to its ending.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I love the challenge, this has been super fun for all the family, we have had nice time trying to figure out the puzzles this new toy represents for adults and children.<br />It was worth the try!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The story continues - and it is still exciting and worth the read.  Tyrion's story continues - I was left wondering about him at the end of the last book.  As usual, any book by George R.R. Martin is good reading.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|WOW! This movie is stunning, thrilling & eye-popping! It was even better in 3-D in the theatre. As a fan of the comic book originals, I was prepared NOT to like it, but I think they did a terrific job of it!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game runs sluggish on my kindle fire.  You can't progress far in the game unless you BUY their acorns.  They make it difficult to win them.  So basically, unless you put out money, try to make do. It takes days and weeks to earn enough money to buy land or animals.  Overall it is a fun game if you don't have plans to expand.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Okay, so I really wanted to like this movie. But I have to confess, I do not like Kristen Stewart as an actor. She is as flat, annoying and one dimensional in this as she was in Twilight. I guess I was just hopeful that she'd be better. Maybe I was counting on the supporting cast to inspire her to greater emotion and acting ability. Is it wrong that I rooted for the queen? If you want a decent Snow White movie, try Mirror Mirror instead.
B0035OC7OU|4.0|I've been reading Terry Pratchett since I was a teenager, originally reading the books in sequence as they were released before eventually losing track in the face of the phenomenal release rate. Mort is every bit as good as I remembered and more. Great fun.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Some actors should not sing. They are bad at it. I am embarrassed for them that they even tried. We watched the first 20 or 25 minutes and turned it off.
0547848412|3.0|I avoided this book for a long time, thinking it had something to do with math.The main character's nickname, Pi, was selected because he liked the math concept and wanted to avoid being teased. How Pi gets his name is a very minor part of the story. The story seems to be about survival between Pi and Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger, yet in the end,the plot twists so you don't know if it's just a made-up story that Pi concocted to forget what really happened. The story alternates between placid descriptions of Pi surviving on the sea and graphic killing descriptions when he or Parker eat. Overall I liked it, but its \\"deeper meaning\\" seems to have drown for me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Started it because the preview seemed interesting but did not like it.  Did not consider it sensual at all. Would not recommend.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|If you liked season 1 or like legal drama shows in general, you should like this season.  If you were a fan of Boston Legal this is along those lines.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|great product I loved it and comes with what I expected, Thank you! very good product hope to keep it up! :)
0920668372|5.0|Absolutely love this book.  Brought tears to my eyes.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Great gift for parents young and old to share with their Children and Grandchildren.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This was a fantastic adventure.  Intriguing.  Educational. It made me hold my breath as I turned the pages.  Surprise ending.  Great entertainment!
B004EPZ08E|5.0|Great movie I recommend for all people to watch this. First time I saw it in the theater I thought it was better then The Hangover.
B005FRF6PC|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  The literary style is a bit repetitive but I learned a lot about what drives him.  Glad I took the time to read it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|works awesome on kindle fire...I don't like when people don't say what device they have so that's why imentioned ihave a kindle fire. for people who get bothered like me :b anyways ilike it. I play every time iwake up and go too sleep. only bad thing is that if you run out of coins i just lose interest lol and for people like me who cant spend money on buying extra coins you have too wait about a couple of hours until you get your coins back.. hope this was helpful (: ignore the ones that say its a boring game!!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a delightful surprise.  Susan has a wonderful voice that is so unexpected.  I really enjoyed this cd and used it for gifts to key people.  It was very well received.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I found this to be a great Xmas time movie.  The great actors, numerous story lines, and humor, along with the 'feel good' generally happy endins all contribute to making this a nice movie which I'll view over and over.
B007SSEU9O|3.0|This is a very interesting, behind the scenes look at a very remarkable lady.  It is a little disconnected in some places but I was glad I saw it.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|but the game could have the time not constantly going uup because that be taking a while and its really good on my kindle thank you for the game
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I have checked every free calendar app I could find in the Kindle store and this one does it all. You can type items in by time or day, view calendar by day week or month,  pick reminders, and add recurrences.  The only problem I have found is when selecting recurrence for all day events (like birthdays) you can not enter the event more than two months in advance.  Other than that I would have rated it Five Stars.  Allan Wasson, Georgia.
1419705849|5.0|My son loves this book. I'm very happy with my purchase and the shipment was timely and it arrived when it was promised as well.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|yea........ its pretty fun. Not as good as temple run. But its fun I mean its for all ages. But check out super penguins that a game like temple run.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I love this CPU, itself is a monster. Used the Intel liquid cooler and works like a charm. Not OC'd it yet, but at still is blazing fast.
B009VL299E|5.0|Loved the DVD , as I'm an avid Metallica fan I love all their music and shows ! Can't wait for for the next album & show !
B00AESN8XY|5.0|So many options, so little time! I spent about a week playing only this game, and did manage to clear everything, but it took many tries to figure out the best strategies for each, UNIQUE infection type. It was that much more enjoyable finally unlocking the Neurax Worm, and I am excited to see what they release next.<br />I have a desire to see three changes:<br />1. Multiple save slots and / or the opportunity to reload from an earlier point during a game<br />2. More, detailed information than the graphs give: days between infection and first death ATTRIBUTED to infection -not floods and such; total $ spent on cure research; ability to access detailed country information from the world infection summary; etc.<br />3. Break down of how points are calculated at game end.<br /><br />Overall, otherwise, incredible and plays spectacularly on my Nexus 7. Highly recommended.
0786891416|5.0|I was so drawn into the story line that it's all I thought about in between readings! Can't wait to sink my teeth into the next book!!
B000FC10WU|4.0|This is the first Miss Marple I have read and I enjoyed the story. Her character did not come across as charming as she does in the movies but it was a good mystery that held my interest.
B000W10AEI|5.0|I bought ths dvd because I'm a die hard Potter afn.  It arrived on time and I've already watched it quite a few times.
B005LAII80|4.0|Dredd represents the paragon of the  system, workmanlike in his relentless pursuit of justice and as unbending as the law he enforces. In an especially bloody opening that feels all too routine, Dredd pursues and dispatches a murderous criminal who, at the last minute, takes a civilian hostage.<br />e image<br />While Dredd himself is mostly a conundrum, Urban brings nuance to the character, infusing him with a bestial but purposeful physicality and giving him a harsh voice that would beat Batman's to a pulp. As Anderson, Thirlby grounds the film emotionally; the stakes for her are higher than just her own life, as she experiences for the first time the realities and costs of the job.<br />There's a cynical way to look at Dredd, : proof for Hollywood that eventually any property can be made to work. But that would miss the point entirely. Dredd works because it's an action flick with wide appeal that takes risks it doesn't need to -- in its delightfully off-putting violence and daring style -- and those choices pay off in a singular and exhilarating movie experience. It's savage, beautiful and loads of fun.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Here is a movie that is funny as H%@#!! This the serious Mark Wahlberg who is normally beating up other guys in most movies but now in a completely different new light!! He is really quite good at comedy. Don't expect a plot or Oscar performance for anyone in this \\"R\\" movie. It is just full of sight gags and adult humor and beer bar style scenes. This is a guy that never grew up ... simple. Extremely clever dialog by Star Trek's Number #1 Patrick Stewart as the narrator is a pretty great way to start any movie. The final comment in his lead off narative had me rolling on the floor!! Funny.. and not expected! So all of those people that said \\"Oh it could have been such a cute, romantic comedy\\" ..or \\"why did they have to use all of that language??\\" ... \\"Hello all of you wishing on a star people out there\\"...this movie was NOT made for you!! This is adult humor and adult comedy and plenty of adult language...so get real...if this kind of thing bothers you.. do not rent it or buy it or watch it. Simple. It is a matter of choice and we all have the ability to choose what we like, and I for one really liked this movie. So am I a bad guy? No, just have a wide range of tastes that include a love for any \\"B\\" Movie. And I have watched alot of movies in my life and enjoyed them all. After all, isn't this just pure entertainment??
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I came to the series late. We rented seasons 1 & 2 and fell in love with the series. After watching the episodes one after the other, we became spoiled. Now we have to wait until season 3 airs. Free Bates.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game was reccomened to me by my wife. She knew I liked games that challenge my brain.<br />I like physics type games, This one here is a blast to sit and figure out just how you need to route the water in order to archive your objective.<br />Which is to route the water, or turning that water into steam in order to fill up the pipes below Perry so that he can travel through the water filled pipes to get out of his chamber and on to the next objective.<br />All the while your being told by your agency how good of a job you are doing.<br />Or you are being taunted by the Evil Science test  of your progress being so slow.<br />Also Perry also likes to tease you as well when you are sitting there trying to figure out Just How your going to do it.<br />Overall I highly reccomend this game.<br />As it is both plain out fun, as well as a worthwhile challenge.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I liked it but the but most of the graphics needed help and you couldn't delete any thing and most of the dragons costed like $400 and I don't have that much gold bars
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I would have liked it better if it was a silent film. The plot was lame and I'm sad that I actually bought it.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|Finally broke down and ordered this after the 4 year old made me rent it every other time we were at the video store. Then, 2 days after it arrived, Disney signs with netflix and it's (more or less) free. Either way, glad we picked it up.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great graphics and fun while it is free....have to buy stuff to continue which kinda sucks. But while it is free it is great.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|It arrived quickly and was packaged very well. I have gotten lots of enjoyment from watching it whenever I want to.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Little bit of comedy, a little bit of drama and a little bit of reality.  I enjoyed it very much.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|too much special effects - too dark - story line meandered around the real story - nice acting, though.  mediocre
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so addicting and i dont even know why! this is a great time waster and boredom killer!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is the first book(s) I have read for relaxation in 3 years.  I started the first one the day after my last paper was turned in.  I finished the last one four days later...I had a difficult time letting these books out of my hands!
B004Q3QRWC|4.0|This is a book that requires a hard copy. You need to flip back and forth through pages and chapters. Unfortunately I just received a Kindle. I read the Kindle version and feel far from satisfied. I am unsure of the relationships and how they relate to each other. The visuals (diagrams) were too small/ dark to read on one page which also created confusion. There is so much to like about this book, yet I feel I confused. I am blaming my lack of Kindle expertise. Probably just operator malfuntion
0525953728|5.0|A real page burner. I could not put it down. A 24 hour marathon book. Lots of coffee and smokes later and I was jonesin' for more. For a &#34;first book&#34; Mark Owen....not his real name for obvious reasons.....did an ok job of making his characters pop. His narratives were engrossing, heart-pounding, bullet dodging exciting. The physical exertion that these men must accomplish on a daily basis, even when not in combat is phenomenal. U.S. Navy Special Warfare types rock.
1611134226|5.0|I am a seriously devoted Pendergast fan and this latest did not disappoint. The writing is beautiful and rich with great detail. I don't believe this is a book for the faint of heart because it feels so real and scary. The endings are never neatly packaged and expected. I can't wait to follow the next chapter in the life of Pendergast and his son (s).
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator meets my needs as a realtor. It downloaded very fast and I use it often. easy to use.
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|Ususally, Big Fish games are great. What I have played so far is not very challenging at all - a 4 year old would love it.  It was a disappointment for me.  (And I hate to say that).
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I didn't want this book to end and couldn't put it down while reading it. Recommended to all of my friends!
B0009K7RES|4.0|I'm losing track of all the Mark Knopfler selections I might be missing but I think there are selections here not on other albums. Most songs on this album are on other albums by him. I thought this Radio Sessions would have extended versions but this is not the case, &#34;Boom Like That&#34; for example, is actually shorter than on &#34;Best of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed reading &#34;Safe Haven&#34;, as I have all of Nicholas Sparks books.He has a style that captures<br />your interest in the very beginning and stays throughout the book.  His characters are very interesting<br />and believeable. I always look forward to his next book.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Although this is quite an old work, it is still relevant for today.  For those of us who sometimes question, &#34;what is the meaning of life?&#34;, Frankl gives us thoughts to ponder.  Life is more meaningful when one has a passion about something or someone.  The different view of the Nazi concentration camps was enlightening for me; the people banded together and protected one another even when the only thing left to them was the prospect of yet another day of suffering.  Perhaps finding a passion or reason to live is the solution to depression treatment; perhaps more effective than drug therapies.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|OUR HOUSEHOLD IS AN ENNTHUASTIC VIEWER OF ALL THE CELTIC<br />WOMAN ALBUMNS.  AFTER WATCHING &#34;BELIEVE&#34;  WE FEEL THAT IT IS<br />THE BEST ONE PRODUCED BECAUSE 1) THERE IS MORE VARIETY IN<br />THE MUSICAL CHOICES 2) THE GOWNS ARE FRESH  3) THERE ARE NEW<br />FEATURES LIE THE &#34;RIVER DANCE&#34; PERFORMANCES AND 4) THE ADD<br />OF THE CHILDREN SINGING WITH THE REGULAR VOCALISTS GIVES A<br />SWEETNESS TO THE PRESENTATIONS.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|It was clever, moved quickly and Robert Downey, Jr & Jude Law were great. I'll be watching the second one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is the one book that I couldn't put down I took it everywhere I had to hide it under the table at dinner it kept me up all night every night just thinking about it
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I have grown wary of books where the word Publisher is followed by the author's name. All too often there's an excellent reason for it. But Courtney Milan is an exception. Her writing is smooth, the story was great, her characters are interesting & intelligent. I will be reading the sequels.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing and by far my favorite. I was so sad that this trilogy had to end. It will defiantly be one series I read over and over.
0394800184|5.0|Good childrens book about a baby bird searching for its' mom . Is VERY cute & is an adventure for the baby bird .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is basic stuff but is and can change to be more functional as needed. It does all I need it to do. Thanks for making it free!
B0015DROBO|3.0|Although the story starts out with financial data, potentially dull to some readers, intrigue comes with the introduction of &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34;.  This complex drama is page-turning and exciting.  The girl remains mysterious but, of course, there are two more books in the trilogy.<br />Eleanor Pingree, author of  &#34;A Salem Chronicle&#34;
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is great. Good quality. A good game for my little pony lovers. The picture is awesome. One thing is that it includes all of the ponies for the show. Especially, Princess Celstia!<br />  GET THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!
1118232658|5.0|Socialnomics is a must read! Whether you are new to social media or an expert, Qualman does a great job of showcasing via great story telling how business and people can leverage social media now and in the future. Believe this may be as ground breaking as Chris Anderson's \\"The Long Tail.\\"
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Enjoy. Entertaining, reflective, informative and constructive. Wishlist the rest of his books. Like that he is honest about the people that cook your favorite meals.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|This Dredd was worse than the old on which is saying something.<br /><br />Have u seen the movie lockout? Same thing here. The only cool thing about either movie is the gun.  However I still enjoy Karl Urban , in Dredd though they  gave him a batman of late voice.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|love this game and cant want for the next. one<br />loved the game cant wait to play the next one
B00884GR0W|5.0|Everyone says Block Story is copying Minecraft. NO IT IS NOT!!! Block Story has way better graphics than Minecraft. I used to be skeptical and was all that's such a copy of Minecraft, but it wasn't. I tried it out because it was the free app of the day and it works perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD. There has been no glitches or anything. The only thing I don't like is if your underground and there's an earthquake you will go through the wall. I was a COMPLETE FANATIC about Minecraft and me and my friends only played Minecraft and that was legit. Now I could care less about Minecraft. Now, I just have to get my friends to play it.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|My son and I love this show. Another great season. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good crime show.
0399160450|4.0|Great read. Couldn`t set book down,once started.<br />Would make a great movie. Can`t wait to see if this happens.<br />Also, can't wait for next book in the series.
B007EECSFA|3.0|This is an unusual book for those who loved her other books. It does drag a bit and the switching back and forth between time lines makes it hard to follow. Her writing wasn't the best style this time. I had hoped to see something more on the emotional lines of Sarah's Key. This didn't quite reach that level.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I love the trilogy.  The picture quality is great as well as the price.  This makes a great gift and I would definitely recommend.
B009DJB9HC|1.0|This just was not as good as I hoped it would be, or as good as earlier stuff. Even though I liked some cuts.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Really cool, but doesn't include the &#34;behind the scenes&#34;.  Other than that, it was a great price for the series.
B00AJV4G28|5.0|Not a lot to say here. It's Buddy Guy at his home club tearing the roof off the place. Funny dialogue in some spots during songs. ( R-rated)
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This remains one of the best books ever written. It well depicts mans triumph over adverisity. I will read it again...
B0068MNO4S|4.0|Anonymous takes a popular conspiracy theory about the identity of Shakespeare, mixes it intelligently with some clever parallels in his plays and gives the audience one of the strongest historical thrillers in years. The film moves around timelines mercilessly, introduces a range of characters quickly and doesn't do anything to spoon feed or talk down to the audience. It's extremely well plotted and gives the viewer plenty to think about, even if you never believed the rumors about Shakespeare in the first place.<br /><br />Considering this comes from the director of The Day After Tomorrow and 10,000 BC, the movie also demonstrates a near-perfect use of computer graphics sequences that recreate a long-gone era flawlessly (it's truly hard to believe these aren't elaborate sets). This is aided by the production design generally to illustrate one of the richest backdrops for historical fiction that I've seen in years.<br /><br />So was this really directed by a Hollywood elite who couldn't be named for political reasons so he handed it off to a much less capable director? Probably not but if this really is Roland Emmerich's work, in reality I have to commend him on producing one of the best films of the year. It well-paced, thoughtful, meticulously plotted - and really should have been up for an Oscar.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't  put this down!!  Excellent and unique story. Keeps you guessing, has some unpredictable turns.  It is a must read for everyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once you begin this series you cannot leave it alone.  Wonderful acting, great story lines, sublime setting. Very highly recommended.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|It's fun. The acting is fun to watch. The plot operates within its own rules, which are generally well-explained. It looks great. But you don't want to think about it too hard because (a) it'll hurt your brain, and (b) either the time-travel rules it gives itself are too arbitrary or it will turn out not to make sense. But it's a time travel film with JGL and Bruce, so what's not to like?
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I would recommend this trilogy. Well written great history lesson. Can't wait four the third in the series.. WINTER OF THE WORLD
B009NQKXYK|3.0|It kept my attention, but when it was over, I didn't care. Two days later, I could barely tell you what it's about.
B0030MM68O|4.0|I expected it to be better.  With all the hype I thought it should be better than it was.<br />That's all.
B008ZDC7M8|4.0|The Story Of Film is a 15 hour documentary on film history.  David Cousins does not look at the usual films shown in documentaries on film history.  Don't expect to find in depth discussions on Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, or other typical films.  And Cousins makes a good argument for excluding typical romantic classical films.  This help to make The Story Of Film fresh & innovative.  You won't find a detailed discussion of Frank Capra, but you'll discover Yasujiro Ozu's contribution to film history.  Greta Garbo's career is not discussed, but you will be introduced to little known Chinese actress Ruan Lingyu.<br /><br />Cousins strength is that he explains why the films he talks about are exceptional.  He gives a new perspective on how to watch a movie - why or (in some instances for me) why not the film is important to film history.  I am an avid film buff & thought I knew a lot about film history.  The Story Of Film really opened me to many films & filmmakers I knew nothing about - many have never been mentioned before!  He also shows how filmmakers learn from one another through time - how directors today borrow & expand on ideas from directors in the past.  It helps to understand why certain films & directors are important & relevant in film history.  This to me is the main strength of The Story Of Film.<br /><br />After watching the first few episodes of The Story Of Film I wanted to see some of the films mentioned.  Many of them are not available.  Some of the directors mentioned have only a very limited selection available, which is sad but understandable in todays economy.  Many of these films do not appeal to a wide audience, unfortunately.<br /><br />There are 3 negatives about The Story Of Film I have to mention.  The first one is the narration by Cousins.  For someone so passionate about film, his voice is very monotone and really lessens the impact of his documentary.  The second negative is that there are not enough film clips.  When discussing therelevance of a certain film, rather than showing a clip of the film Cousins shows a modern day shot of the city or country of the films origin.  It makes The Story Of Film less compelling.  The last negative is that I feel that some of the films/filmmakers discussed are included because of the country of origin & not for the innovative quality or groundbreaking filmmaking.  For example, after Cousins discussion on Youssef Chahine's film \\"Cairo Station\\" I watched the film.  While a milestone in Arab film history, I did not find the film all that original in either story or filmmaking technique.  (This is not to say that it is not a good movie.)<br /><br />After seeing 1,000s of films, Cousins has shown me a new way to view films.  For this reason The Story Of Film is worth the time.
0553801473|1.0|For fans of this series, if you haven't \\"attempted\\" to read this yet, I strongly urge you to get this book at the library. Take a friend out to lunch for the money you'll save. It will be well worth it.<br /><br />For the record, I'm a huge fan. I loved the first 3 books of this series and thirsted for more; upon reading A Feast for Crows, though, I started to get a little put off. Too much jumping around, not enough movement, too many new characters making appearances that did nothing for the story but fatten the book. And then I read the Author's notes in which he described his effort to write AFFC \\"a b**ch\\". Got me thinking that GRRM is tired of his effort in the series. And it was telling in the way that book read.<br /><br />When I opened up Dance with Dragons (thankfully obtained at the library), I read the Author's note first. He said, if the last one was \\"a b**ch, this one was three b**ches and a bastard.\\" Not an auspicious statement and as it turns out, this book was exactly \\"three b**ches and a bastard\\" to read.<br /><br />The hardcover is, I think, about 1016 pages long including about 52 pages of character lists at the end. Some of the favorite and interesting characters make an appearance at the beginning and never return or halfway through and stay for a chapter. And do nothing to advance the plot. Some of the characters go by different names throughout so you have almost no idea who you're reading about while the plot is not advancing. (I gave up and skipped entire chapters at a time or read the last page of a chapter and was none the worse at the end.) About 6 new characters are introduced in every chapter that have nothing to do with anything. The plot, I'm not kidding, in 1016 pages seems to move about one month in the timeline. It is so godawful dull and boring and unimaginative, it could only be written by a great author who no longer gives a rip about this series ... and should just kill it now. I don't even want to know how it ends. Almost no character he made me love or even hate survives in any form I care to read about any further. I just don't care anymore. It's a sad thing for an author when his indifference seeps into his writing and that indifference numbs his fans. The only fantasy in this series is GRRM's conviction that this is something worthy of reading. It's just bad writing, bad (as in zero) editing, bad character development, bad period. Fifty-two pages to list the characters and the plot moves a month or so. Others take him. Winter can't come soon enough.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Installed quickly, and I downloaded a video on my first try, good app!  Interface could be cleaned up a bit.
B000FC11A6|5.0|This was an awesome listen. It was a very long book, but I couldn't wait to go back to it every time life got in the way of listening. I really enjoyed William Dufris' presentation and by the end of nearly 44 hours I still had not tired of his character representations.<br /><br />The book was a joy and I almost wished I had stopped at this one instead of filling my library with other Neal Stephenson's novels.  This novel was well thought out, extremely detailed and I felt it very believable with regard to historical events. I personally have not researched it to see if the actual details of history match the story but either way it's a novel and not a history book.<br /><br />It was easy to listen to and though it spanned a couple generations of folks; the parallels between the characters were clear when they were supposed to be and yet they each kept their own identities. Every time I eat Captain Crunch cereal now I think of this book.<br /><br />There is a hint of anti-Americanism in this book which as I read it seemed to fit the storyline and I dismissed it. However as I read his other novels, I felt it more fully flowered as an author-bias and was not just a part of the story. So for this book I give 5 stars, but for other Neal Stephenson novels I have read, not so much.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|With the movie coming out this summer, (and hearing the movie was nothing like the book) I wanted to check the book out.  It’s a neat concept of being written after the 'zombie apocalypse' and well thought out in regards to tactics of how the remaining humans survived and started fighting back.
B0091REZMW|4.0|love the game but don't like that I have to buy things with real money!! will still play it though because its that great.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved playing it on my ipod and now that i can download it on my kindle fire is awesom!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|works well on kindle fire (1st gen). Responsive controls. I like that I can upgrade and &#34;buy&#34; stuff with the coins that I earn playing the game. I don't have to spend money to enjoy the game. There are also varied options to challenge yourself and earn more stuff. I also like being able to pause in the middle of a run, if I need to. It is one of the better running games that I've played. If you enjoy running games, then get this app.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I have had this watch for just a couple weeks.  My immediate impression was positive.  I like the look, the size, etc.  It's masculine, rugged looking, but also has a touch of elegance.  The only negative for me is the length of the band.  I have a small wrist and it's a bit long for me.  Also, glow of the hands at night is less than optimal.  That said, I am very happy with my purchase and think it a fine value.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I recently just got hooked on the vampire diaries and I love it!! I watched the whole season 3 in one day! Everything about the three [Stefan,Elena, & Damon] makes my heart melt! I def. recommend watching this whole series!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read many Stephen King books - this is one of his best.  I have little time to read but I am finding time to read some of this every day.  My interest is held to say the least.  I have not finished this as of today - so I expect to either edit this review or write another.  At 21% done I look forward to time with this story.  Thanks Stephen King.
0805047905|5.0|Great book as are the rest from this series. My kids can not read but after a couple of days knew all the words to the book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I play the game with my grandchildren and it is entertaining and fun. love it<br />Love the many levels ...challe<br /><br />nging.
B002VHI8FE|3.0|It's entertaining but not nearly on par with the better fantasy series.  Its hard to understand any of the character's motivations because for the most part they arent explained. The main characters are developed slowly and you learn more about them well into the third book but very slow in developing.  Most of the secondary Characters are thrown into the series with little to no explanation of their background and none to come as the story develops..The battle scenes are decent and its fun to watch nine fingers &#34;lose it&#34; so to speak.  The evil character's &#34;the feared&#34; and the &#34;witch&#34; are cool but a no show for great lengths after initially introduced.  If you have read most of the fantasy series out there and not this, then i would definitely try it. Despite its opportunites, it is still an entertaining read.<br />Ken
B004LROMWU|5.0|It was wonderful, great, better than I expected.  I have really enjoyed watching the DVD's.  The price was just right for the product.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is almost like the Pc version only without all the new updates with the app I can play with friend on the go not just at home.
B002P93VGO|4.0|In all honesty, this isnt a great movie. It isnt nearly as good as the original trilogy or First Class, but it is Hugh Jackman kicking the crap out of people and being really bad bass ;) all in all lots of fun.
B0011UF792|5.0|First of all .... You need a sense of humor!...And you need to read the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie, With that said, This is one of my favorite movies of all time George Carlin is great and has the perfect part.<br /><br />I have Dogma on DVD but the Blu-ray is far superior.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with a good sense of humor and an open mind
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love playing angry birds.........can't get enough of it..since this is my second Nook....glad I didn't have to pay for it twice.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had just received the HD Kindle Fire for my birthday and I am hooked on the Downton series. I decided to test the quality of my Kindle and keep up with the series by downloading this episode. Of course, I enjoyed this episode and the quality the HD  was amazing.
B0086700CM|5.0|its really fun I would play it all day if I could. I love all the obstacles you have yo go through. I would recommend this game to a lot of people.
B005LAII12|5.0|It was awesome my boyfriend loved it , great Christmas present. I had to keep him from buying it himself and it came right at the perfect time.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a wonderful read,  it manages to be dire but often funny at the same time<br /><br />I  hope Mr Weir  continues to write<br /><br />Dr John Harris  ..  Towson University, MD
B0063GORYU|5.0|Enjoy the challenge and feel others will also like the game. I have not experienced this particular type of solitaire and like the fact that is quite different from the ordinary game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful! The quality of the letters and the way this entire book was structured was incredible!
B008X9Z37A|4.0|For the price it is ok.  Would have preferred it in other colors and not just black. Not sure how long the corners will hold up.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Amazing. Makes you think about love in a way most never would. Beautiful and definitely worth more than the 3 dollar steal I got.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Very hard to read. Wish there was a way for the cards to be larger and to see the numbers more clearly.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|If you are willing to pay you can play this game after the first set of coins. This is a boring game to pass time.  Tried for free now deleted - this is not really a free game.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Grandson downloaded this game. He will be able to play it when he comes over to visit. We will have fun together.
B005XLN97M|5.0|I like how easy it was to put this together. My daughter was so excited. She was even able to help me assemble it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Spend way toooo much time playing.  Love the designs it makes when you win a game.  It is fun to play
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Never in my life have I read a book that was so thoroughly authored. No author in my experience exists, who can as marvelously developed his/her characters as well as Victor Hugo in this book. Nor do I remember a book that brought—as little as it may be—tears to my eyes. “Les Mis&eacute;rables” a MUST on every one’s reading list, young or old.<br />If you do know the story, I’d recommend this abridged version. But if you have never read or know little of this magnificent tale, get the full experience.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is the amazing story pretty much everyone knows. I am definitely a team PEETA fan but I love this book to death!!! The beginning didn't contain too much action but as you get farther I KNOW YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO!!!!!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|All I can say is GREAT SHOW!!!  I'm new to the show, but absolutely love it - can't wait for new episodes!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read it on my iPhone. Well crafted, intriguing turns of events, no boring moments, and a high speed read!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Once again outstanding story tell, a real time rock star.<br /><br />John Corey is one of the best minds of all time.<br /><br />Please Nelson at least 2-3 a year.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Always looking for the next best fantasy read.  Somehow stumbled on Blood Song. Have read Martin and Abercrombie and Durham, but this is the best read so far.  Nothing is written that does not later mean something integral to the plot.  A masterpiece of fantasy well worth your time. Counting the days to Book 2.
B002APU580|5.0|Very well done remake that doesn't stick to the original. I enjoyed so much that I purchased the DVD so that I will be able to see again and again. I also have the PBS version which is also masterfully done. The story itself is wonderful and if you haven't read it, you should.
B001P59V5Y|5.0|Awesome movie.  Friends made me watch this after I missed a running &#34;what did the Romans ever do for us&#34; joke... it was fantastic to watch, one of their best movies, by far!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is awesome. All of the apps that are usually free on the Amazon app store usually stink. However, one minute after I started playing this I loved it. This is a puzzle game and although it makes you think it's not to the point where it doesn't make it fun. Not only is it a great game but the replay value is also very very high.. This is one of my favorite games.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is fantastic.  Seriously well-written and well-acted drama, that has many comedic moments.  This is a time piece, and it shows that time at the turn of the 20th Century in Britain so well.  As usual, Amazon's HD Stream is top notch in quality.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was an excellent finishing for the Hunger Games trilogy. It was a fast  paced page turner with a realistic ending.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Amazon's HD Stream Quality is excellent, and sharp, just like Suits.  This has quickly become my favorite show on television.  The depth of the characters and the likability is amazing.  Must watch TV.

030758836X|5.0|This book haunted me because I know people like this.  Ever since I read the Sociopath Next Door that claims 4% of the population is scociopathic, I have noticed folks like these characters in my life--yes the story is out there, but I think it is believable.

B005PWPUW6|3.0|I'm using this converter to produce a two channel stereo audio feed from the digital audio ONLY SPDIF audio output on the flat screen television.  Our TV has a RCA/COAX digital output instead of the fiber optical toslink.  After living with it for a couple of months, the AC/DC transformer is scrapped.  It seems to me a design oversight (like TV manufacturers omission of analog audio outputs) that this converter doesn't include it's own OFF switch.<br /><br />Maybe this wouldn't be necessary if the occasional static feedback loop from Hell didn't inject itself into the audio stream at random intervals.  Shutting it off is the only way to kill it.  On hindsight, maybe a three prong grounded transformer would shut down that feedback loop for a few more dollars.  This sadly isn't the only incident requiring a complete shut down.<br /><br />I've found the converter itself builds up an RMF interference field which is visible on the analog channels from the local stations via antenna.  It might be appropriate to blame this on poor insulation of the coax cable antenna feed.  But it's not an issue with the digital channels feeding through the same antenna and coax cable.  So, to overcome the RMF interference it's necessary to use a mini USB cord plugged into the TV USB firmware service port.  It must be unplugged each time I've finished using it.<br /><br />Here's the right sort of mini USB cable.  [[ASIN:B005441I2G Apricorn Hi Speed USB 2.0 A to Mini-B Cable - Black - 1Meter/3 Feet (A1M-USB2-A-MINIB)]]  It does the job without static.<br /><br />In summation, this audio conversion synchronizes the the stereo audio to an analog receiver, including HDMI digital content from an [[ASIN:B003NS0UUQ New 3 RCA Composite S-video R/L Audio to HDMI Converter]], which would otherwise present some latency in the HDMI digital audio signal.<br /><br />This means I can use the s-video outlet on a DVD player with no HDMI outlet.  And the DVD analog stereo audio RCA jacks also feed into the HDMI converter, which in turn links the player to the TV.  From there the TV digital audio is converted to analog audio by the FiiO D3, and there is no latency between the TV speakers and the external stereo speakers.HDMI converter, which in turn links the player to the TV.

B00ADYY7MA|4.0|This is a great soundtrack, but I am only giving it a four star because there are three songs on there that I do not like.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's a really fun game, but for some reason, the daily challenge says, &quot;come back in 00:00:00 for the next daily challenge!&quot; but it's stuck on 00:00:00

B004MC8CA2|5.0|The YouVersion has the best versions of the Bible to choose from and just the ones I'm interested in reading. When I've tried online Bible programs before they were never this easy or readily available as YouVersion. I read my Bible more regularly now that I have this App on my Kindle Fire.  I love everything about this App!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I saw the movie of the first book. So I wanted to read this one before I saw the movie.  I couldn't put it down! If I tried stopping when one chapter was done, I couldn't! I had to keep reading!! Can't wait to read the last book!!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|hadn't seen this in quite some time and really enjoyed a forgotten christmas classic.<br />some moments were funny, some were sick-making, but a very entertaining movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It started out a little slow but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. It was a very good book.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|not at all what i expected but was troubling and funny at the same time. very well done and would watch over again.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|Too much dark and gloomy scenarios. Even flowers could not make me want to read this author again. I couldn't wait to finish the book and move on to something better.

B0090EHVMC|5.0|It was an awesome movie and I loved all of the caricters and all the people songs and yeah love this movie
B002ZG99TA|5.0|i may be prejudiced as it was made near my hometown but i thought this was<br />a high energy film from start to finish. i usually get bored or sleepy but this had my attention<br />the entire run.
0307891402|5.0|detailed maps,  dungeon hints tips. and so much more.  skyrim is huge and this book was an absolute must.  helped explain so many things like perks, quests, powers, abilities.  i usually don't go in for game guides but this one made skyrim that much more enjoyable .  my sons friends  call him for info from the guide.  it does NOT contain data for the DLC.  The hardcover makes so much more durable than the paper backs.  bought one of the paperback guides years ago.  it last less than six months with moderate use and it fell apart
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A great classic that takes you on an adventure with every challenge the yellow brick road leads them to.  Much darker than the film.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|looking for something different then this is it.  not overly gory but  not a kids movie either.  we were very entertained
B002ELIXCA|5.0|Season one sets the tone, pace and wildly engrossing phenomenon known as 'Dex'; a doughnut buying, deftly sincere serial killer who lives by a code.I'm often asked 'how can you watch a show about a serial killer?&#34; Easy, if the plots are interwoven, the circumstances bizarre and the outcomes unpredictable. I hope it stays off network TV, they don't deserve Dexter.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A most remarkable book about the humanity of a German man in the midst of World War Two. This is a book you will not put down.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I personally enjoy the character Ashton plays. He reminds me of my booty. This was a funny, cute, and adorable movie. Many people may not relate to the story, but I did, which was good.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|I had no idea that Clint Eastwood directed this movie.  Originally, I saw the last half of the movie on cable.  I was so intrigued, I ordered the DVD.  My spouse and I watched it last night and we both loved it.  It is not the typical non-western formula so often employed by Eastwood e.g. the tear-jerker Million Dollar Baby.  The movie explores life after death without a preachy religious undertone.  The film was well cast.  Several stories are interwoven.  The story of the identical twins is especially touching.  This weekend, I'm bringing the DVD to watch with some elderly folks.  It is a story of hope.  I'm surprised that I never heard of it before.  Maybe is wasn't violent enough for Hollywood tastes.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The first 50 boards require little thought but the train you for the harder ones. I didn't start getting stumped until the third size of boards. Some have gotten so difficult that I have skipped them. This is a great brain game!

B009AP2G26|5.0|Swan Song is one of the best episoded in a while.  I really enjoyed the 2 songs by Lea Michelle/Rachel.  Lea sang them both so well.  Also, Chris Cofer/Kurt had a really nice solo.  The scenes during Lea's solo of Holy Night were very well done.  I would recommend viewing this episode of Glee.  I would recommend buying this episode of Glee.  It is a winner.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This movie is shot very creatively, moves along at a nice pace, and delivers in every way. Very quirky which was expected from Wes Anderson. Short but sweet!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow!!! Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins was hard to put down and what an end!!!  It took me by surprise.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Excellent children's movie...children of all ages, and a charming<br />classic.  The  songs by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, and<br />cast make it memorable, and one to enjoy time after time.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|I'm an enormous fan of Burton's earlier stuff, and Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my all-time favorite movies. But, other than Sweeney Todd, his later work has been leaving me kind of cold. I love monster movies, and I caught every reference in this film, and I wanted to like it. I really did want to. I just didn't. It was kind of boring.<br /><br />I had the same problem with this that I had with Corpse Bride, which is that his characters are designed so that they never really look all that interested in what's going on around them. They don't seem affected, which makes it hard for me to care about what's going on either. I get that this isn't using real actors, but this isn't something that affected Nightmare Before Christmas, where the characters showed actual emotion. But here it seems like we get a couple tears pooling and that's it. The rest of it is strangely monotone.<br /><br />Also, the monsters in the second half were kind of scary for a kid's movie. Assuming this was a kid's movie. It was marketed that way, and it isn't terribly complex, which makes me think it can't possibly be for adults. But it's seems too scary for kids under seven or eight. I think the cat metamorphosing into a half-bat winged creature with claws that then scuttled around the room lightening fast only to try to attack people is a little much for kids under that age. And it's going to be too slow for most kids over eleven or twelve. If it is meant for kids, that leaves Burton a very narrow audience. If he meant to aim for adults, well, he underestimated his viewers' level of sophistication.<br /><br />The movie simply seemed bland, even curiously boring. Burton probably got a lot of people through the door based on the trailer, which was far more interesting than the actual movie, but the audience likely to really enjoy this movie seems small. And for the first time since Corpse Bride, I just wasn't in it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a interesting game very fun but diamonds are a very big part of it.<br />The competition part is very energy requiring but for a free app I give it 5 stars
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|Game did not work. All I got was a black screen and I have to turn phone cimpletely off and reboot.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I really like the default controls. They stay out of the way of my brain.<br />I'd like to see more patterns/colors or themes, and perhaps more content or play modes.
B00005K9LM|5.0|There is one JP better than this, but you have heard those songs more on the radio. This is my favorite JP, and it fits in any heavy collection with Ozzie/Sabbath, Dio, Deep Purple, Megadeath, Metallica, Pantera etc.
B008220D5K|1.0|As a big fan of Knocked Up I was really looking forward to this movie but I was disappointed.  Unlike Knocked Up this move has a depressing, heavy tone running through the whole movie and the jokes aren't funny because the movie is so depressing.  It's about two people that hate each other which causes the audience to hate the characters and themselves for seeing the movie.  What a disappointment, save yourself the time.
B00006F2WY|5.0|I heard this on vinyl as a kid, but somebody else got the record shortly after and I never saw it again. This CD version has great sound and I played it many times the first week. Probably better if you are already a Deep Purple fan. Blackmore/Gillian/Lord are superb this concert.
0345529057|5.0|I started reading these years ago and got hooked. I have recommended them to numerous friends, and they are all now game of thrones addicts as well.

B0038W0OIK|2.0|I am totally blind and I do much of my work at home on the pc.<br />I also produce audio files from time to time so I needed something that sounded great with music as well.<br />I've been using pc headsets for 14 years now with verious success.<br />  This headset sounds good out of the box but not great as the base appears nonexistent at times.<br />Steelseries doesn't include drivers for this product so I needed to go download the drivers from the website to access equalizers and profiles, however, the download area is inaccessible to my screen reader so I've not been able to download them.<br />  The 2 huge issues I have with this headset are the microphone and the build quality.<br />Like most reviewers I appreciated the fact that the mic is retractable however, it's extremely sensitive and picks up everything your hearing in the headset so if I was speaking to someone on skype or a recording, they could hear my screen reader and anything else on my pc as well as small background noises in other rooms.<br />  There is a major design flaw many other customers have pointed out.<br />Over time, the bridge becomes week around the connectors and one side of the unit stops working permanantly, I went through 3 replacements in the 14 months I had the headset all with this problem after a couple months.<br />I really took care making sure I didn't move them much.<br />I also had the cord stop working several times but replaced it with a cord leftover from the returned units.<br />  The extra long cord that can be replaced and the 2 sets of pads were a nice touch but if the headset keeps breaking down, not much use.<br />Unles steelseries acknowledges and fixes the bridge problem, I don't feel comfortable recommending this headset because if it works more than a few months, it seems to be the acception and after a year when the headset and replacements are no longer covered in the US, you'd be stuck with a dud pair of cans.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was less 'scary' and more militaristic, but the technical aspect of how they fought the zombies was interesting and informative.I thought the varying points-of-view added depth and dimension of the story. However, the encounters with the zombies were creeptastic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enough said.  Well since it says I have to have more than 18 words I will say I can't wait for more episodes!

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book!! It was a quick and easy read. The flow of the book was consistent. It made you feel as if you were there, seeing, smelling, tasting and feeling every word. This book is imaginative and fairy tale like. It transports you to a different time and a whole new world. I would have liked a more detailed ending but it is once again leaving it to imagination ;)
B004AUHWLQ|5.0|Jack Lemmon is a lonely office worker at a national insurance firm in a New York City skyscraper. To climb the corporate ladder, he allows four company managers to take turns borrowing his West Side apartment for extramarital liaisons, often so noisy that his neighbors notice. The four write glowing reports about Baxter, and eventually he's promoted - after adding a fifth man (the personnel director) to the rotation.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lemmon's a secret admirer of elevator operator Shirley MacLaine. He finally gets the nerve to ask her out, but she stands him up - turns out she's the source of the personnel director's attentions. A few weeks later, his secretary reveals the personnel director's long history of affairs and promises of divorce, shattering MacLaine.<br /><br />The 'good news' is that eventually this complicated plot works its way to Lemmon quiting his job, and he and MacLaine falling in love with each other.<br /><br />It was also interesting to see the mass of clerks calculating with the old Fridens, manually operated elevators, and the elevator 'starter' on the ground floor.

B005LAIHQS|5.0|I genuinely enjoyed this Men in Black 3 movie.  The movie just works on so many levels. I enjoyed each character so much.  The story was tight and funny.  The story had sufficient plot twists to keep it fresh and interesting.  The story revealed why Agent K behaved as he did.  Best of all Men in Black 3 (Two Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy) revealed Agent K to be a real stand up guy.  This will have to be one of my shortest reviews because; I simply do not want to give away any of the plot in the movie since I enjoyed it so much I won't spoil it for others.  I will say the picture and sound quality of the blue ray was excellent.  As we all know just because; the format is blue ray does not mean the video transfer is always first rate.  In this case the video transfer resulted in a crisp clear transfer where the colors were alive and vibrant.  I watched the movie on a 55 inch screen at 240 MHz refresh rate and the movie was just awesome.  The acting was awesome.  The dialogue was snappy.  Again you must remember that I personally love the MIB franchise so it would be hard for it to disappoint me that said I still rank this as one of the top twenty five pictures that I love.  I am over 50 years old so I have seen some great pictures accounting for the large list of great movies I have seen.  My purchase of Men in Black 3 (Two Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy) is one I do not regret in the least and I am happy to add it to my MIB collection.

0307960471|5.0|First, to reply to those who disliked this book, Nesbo does not write in that \\"oh how I will make you love Lisbeth Slander\\" style of Steig Larsen. Nesbo's writing is far more intense, darker, and verbally denser. This is the 3rd book of his I have read, and in my opinion, by far the best of all 3.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was fun and interesting. Fun for the whole family. The walking around towards the end was kinda monotonous.  Other than that the game was done very well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A very interesting read with powerful content.  It must be impossible to put into words what he believes he experienced.  Being a Neurologist,  Dr. Alexander presents a very unique perspective.  His personal story adds substance and is very interesting in its own right.<br /><br />The book will impact you if you read the content and contemplate the potential in our unexplained Universe (Omniverse?).  Out-and-out skeptics are never swayed.  I have been somewhat skeptical about Near Death Experience.  Proof of Heaven is very compelling.  It gives me hope and brings a sense of ominous inevitability at the same time.<br /><br />A well done book.
B008476HBM|5.0|I like Pride and Prejudice, so naturally I'll rate this edition highly. I like the story, and I like learning about that time period too.

The book covers all of the fundamentals of exposure and teaches the reader how to comprehend the principles and art of photography and how to move away from the camera's auto mode and how to choose the creatively correct exposure every time.  A must have for anyone who wants to become a better photographer.

B00AIBZM40|4.0|Mama is a good semi-creepy horror movie about two young children who spend five years alone in the woods and are later found and adopted by their uncle (the Kingslayer actor from Game of Thrones) and his wife (the always great Jessica Chastain in full goth mode, trading in her trademark red hair for black and sporting tattoos). Of course, something the children call \\"Mama\\" comes home with them and thus the horror begins. Maybe a little too much CGI used, but most of it looked okay. All in all, this is a well made ghost story that packs a few scares and has good acting throughout.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I heard of Macklemore through his song Thrift Shop, like most other people.  I thought he would just be a guy who is similar to Lonely Island, but I was wrong.  He is an great talent, and his songs have a mix of great sound, humor, and emotion.  Ryan Lewis isn't bad either ;)  I would recommend this album to everyone.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|I was in the mood for something light and fun to watch, and found out the title track during the ending credits was \\"Rule the World,\\" by Take That, which was the clincher for me. Sounds kinda lame, I know, but there you go.  Robert de Niro gave a very good performance--a big twist from his usual character roles.  All the actors gave good performances.  If you want something on the light side, but okay entertainiment, this might do it.

B009CGCQPU|5.0|Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFaydyen gave outstanding performances as Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.  I was most impressed by Mr. MacFaydyen.  The movie was understandably condensed to meet industry standards.  That said, I loved it.  The supporting actors were all very good.  I always like to watch Donald Sutherland. He did not disappoint.  The period setting was very well done.  Mr. Collins' character was well done, poor thing.  If you are a fan of Pride and Prejudice, I think you will be very pleased.  Everything about it was very well done, especially Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.  He gave an outstanding performance. Loved it! I watch this particular version often.

B005DOJ68K|5.0|All the best from CCR! Love to play this any time as every song brings back great memories. For me, the sound is excellent as I don't care to listen for every little 'critiqueable' element and just enjoy listening for the pure enjoyment of listening to music I love. So no technical critique here, just a 5-star rating for great music that I love listening to.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Real, no pretense...just the Stones honoring Muddy Waters, one their biggest influences and a chance to play together along with greats like Junior Wells, Buddy Guy, Lefty Diz  as well as Muddy's own band is an unimaginable treat. If you are a fan of the blues and want to know who influenced the Stones, don't let this one pass you by. Muddy only lived a couple more years after this gig.

B0083VP2KQ|5.0|If you loved the original Walking With Dinosaurs series (and I still do!), you must see this.  Like WWD, it's almost all dino-animation; very little interruption - and when the flow is broken, it's to explain the scientific reasoning that supports the (sometimes surprising) conclusions.  And while WWD's animation was excellent for its time, this show demonstrates the improvements possible with 2012 technology.<br /><br />If you were disappointed by Jurassic Fight Club (and I was!), this is everything JFC wasn't.  No repetition of video sequences, and best of all, no annoying George Blasing (sorry, George).<br /><br />I see a lot of reviews for dinosaur shows that begin with something like, \\"My 5-year-old grandson is crazy for dinosaurs, so I bought him this...\\"  Well, maybe you think dinosaurs are a phase that you're supposed to grow out of, but not all of us think like that.  And the BBC, with \\"Walking With Dinosaurs\\" and this show, Planet Dinosaur, acknowledges this fact.  This is NOT a kiddie show.  This is aimed at an adult, very sophisticated audience, and it shows.<br /><br />The visuals here are beautiful, and often stunning.  The animation is so lifelike it must be seen to be believed.  The effects are amazing - my favorite may be the running raid on a Centrosaur herd by a group of Daspletosaurs, driving them into a flooding river -- in a thunderstorm.<br /><br />As someone mentioned, many animals make their animated debuts in this series, and they're worth the wait.  Don't confuse Planet Dinosaur with \\"Dinosaur Planet\\"; that was good, but this is far, far better.<br /><br />One earlier review complained about the constant \\"drumbeat\\" of eating and killing, that dinosaurs are portrayed as mindless eating machines.  Well, unless you read different science books than I do, I have to say that's pretty much what they were, and what most animals still are.  When they're not sleeping or breeding, most animals are either eating, trying to kill another animal, or trying not to be killed.  I'm not sure what more the other reviewer expected, because watching dinos sleep makes a pretty slow-moving video.<br /><br />Still, it's true that the predation is realistic, graphic, and relentless, and might be scary (or \\"gross\\") for very young viewers.  If you're buying dinosaur shows for your grandchildren, this might not be the best choice.  For a proverbial dino-crazed 5-year-old, I recommend Disney's \\"Dinosaur\\" movie, or PBS' excellent \\"Dinosaur Train\\" series (which actually has good science and a real scientist).<br /><br />For the adult dinosaur enthusiast, though, and with all respect to Walking With Dinosaurs (a classic, and still one of my favorites) if you only have room for one dino DVD on your shelf, this is the one to buy.

B000ZJTPLG|5.0|I bought the Vox Amplug AC30 and loved it so much, it probably doubled (or tripled) the amount of time I play guitar.  I loved it so much I went out and got the more expensive (by $10) Joe Satriani Signature Amplug.  I liked the Satriani model also because it covered a different tonal range than the AC30, and delay feature is a lot of fun.  But I had serious questions about the Classic Rock Amplug.  Why did have only a 4-star review on Amazon - among the lowest for any of the fabulous Amplug products.  Would it be only a \\"one trick pony\\"?<br /><br />Well, I have to tell you, I was completely blown away by how great the Classic Rock Amplug is, and I'm now even more blown away by some of these negative reviews.  I've tried out a number of effects pedals for plugging into an actual guitar amplifier, and many pedal users are seeking what they call a \\"Marshall-in-a-box\\".  In other words, they want a effects pedal that will single-handedly transform whatever amp they have into the sound of a miniaturized stack of Marshalls.  Believe it or not, the Vox Classic Rock on higher gain settings is about as close to a \\"Marshall\\" sound as I can imagine.  And it comes in a small, plastic headphone amplifier that runs on 2 AAA batteries and costs all of $39.99.<br /><br />Functionally, the Classic Rock Amplug is the same as the AC30 - three dials for gain, tone, and volume, an aux in jack (for MP3 players), a headphone jack, and an on/off switch.  But that's where the similarities end.  While the excellent AC30 model simulates the boxy, sparkly sound of a tube amplifier, the Classic Rock packs some PUNCH.  The low end presence on this thing (even through a $20 set of entry-level Sony headphones from Target) is significantly greater than on the AC30.  More importantly, the sound doesn't deteriorate with higher volumes.  There are plenty of ways you can try to play guitar through headphones, but most of them become a static-filled mess as soon as you turn up the volume.  Amazingly, the tiny Amplug has plenty of power on tap, and the \\"overdrive\\" is controlled through analog circuitry, with amazing clarity.<br /><br />But the real surprise in the Classic Rock Amplug (and the point upon which I disagree with several other reviewers here) are the clean and slightly overdrive tones as you roll back on the gain knob.  Several reviewers referred to the clean tones as weak, or claimed that there were no clean tones.  Yet, with both my Les Paul and a Strat, I was able to set the Volume at around 6-8 and the gain at about level 2 and get a very nice clean tone without loss of volume.  If any dirt was remaining, a slight rollback on the guitar volume further cured the problem.  Even better, playing a Strat into the Classic Rock with the gain set somewhere between 2 to 4 actually created a Tubescreamer-like blues tone!  This tone was one of the audio demos offered on Vox's website, but I didn't believe it for myself until I plugged the Classic Rock in and dialed in that tone.<br /><br />Long story short, the Classic Rock is extremely powerful, but more verstaile than I thought.  It can do the high-gain Marshall tones I expected, but also offers a wide array of clean or slightly-overdriven tones.  It might even be more versatile than the AC30 Amplug, though I remain pretty loyal to the AC30.  The good news is that the two models are different enough and cheap enough that you can own both.  Highly recommend the Classic Rock - 5 stars.e tiny Amplug has plenty of power on tap, and the \\"overdrive\\" is controlled through analog circuitry, with amazing clarity.<br /><br />But the real surprise in the Classic Rock Amplug (and the point upon which I disagree with several other reviewers here) are the clean and slightly overdrive tones as you roll back on the gain knob.

B000UR9QHQ|5.0|I've seen &#34;Halloween&#34; many times and it's endlessly watchable. John Carpenter is absolutely Hitchcockian in his delivery of an evil entity's return to his hometown of Haddonfield. Maybe it was seeing it for the first time in High-Def that made me notice Carpenter's use of widescreen and extended camera shots. No fan of today's tasteless gore fests would have the ability to sit still and marvel at the way Carpenter glides the camera through the small town neighborhood. The way that the Shape (Michael Myers) lurks around corners and hides behind trees, stalking Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is truly creepy. Later, he pops out of the shadows and dark spaces and relentlessly pursues her.<br /><br />The music is so scary and is so representative of the horror that occurs on screen. It encourages the way you react to the film as much as the visuals do. The story itself is so simple yet entirely engrossing and somehow Carpenter gets you to really care about Laurie, her friends and even Dr. Loomis. Dr. Loomis, played by the awesome Donald Pleasance, intensifies the danger of the Shape with his retelling of his psychiatric struggles with Michael.<br /><br />This is easily one of the greatest examples of how to make a scary movie without slicing and dicing the cast into a bloody mess. In fact, &#34;Halloween&#34; is practically bloodless in its telling of pure walking evil.
B00000AF95|3.0|Not my favourite Kiss record but \\"Animalize\\" has some classic material from the great 80's Kiss era.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the filler which is no stranger to most Kiss albums. Best tracks for me on here are \\"Heavens On FIre\\", \\"Burn Bitch Burn\\", \\"Thrills In The Night\\" & \\"Muder In High Heels\\".<br /><br />One of Kiss's heavier releases but lacks depth, probably due to Gene's waning interest in the group to becoming an actor instead hower this dosent really bother me as Paul is without doubt the most talented and best member of Kiss...he steps up and produces the record well!
0765325950|5.0|With A Memory of Light, I expected a massive war between the armies of the Light and the Shadowspawn.  What I didn't expect is that the war would take place here on Amazon between the 5-star reviews and the 1-star ones.  I kept track of the ratings as I read this final volume in The Wheel of Time series, but stayed away from the actual reviews in order to avoid spoilers.  Now that I have finished, all I can say is that this book is incredible.  If you are a fan of the series, you will treasure this book as a gripping, emotional conclusion to one of the best fantasy stories of all time.  My deepest thanks to Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson, and Harriet McDougal for creating this masterpiece.  To those 1-star Trollocs who think it is fair to rate a book that they haven't actually read due to issues with e-book release dates, well, all I can say is, we know what happens to Trollocs....

B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the most amazing series I've ever read. The way the author tells of the trials and hardships blows me away. I watched the movie with my wife and slept through it till the games began, but after I read The Hunger Games book one I watched and picked the movie apart right along with my wife. Then I read Catching Fire and want more. I finished Catching Fire while out to sea with the navy,and now I'm sad that it was so fast paced and held my attention so easily. I can't wait to get home to download the third book in this amazing series.<br />TO THE AUTHOR:<br />Suzanne Collins you did an incredible job writing this wonderfully suspense series. Depending how the third book ends I hope a fourth is in the works.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Don't waste your time on this one.  Unbelievable characters, unbelievable relationships, and an ending that is about the lamest cop-out I've ever read. The author just mails it in; must have had a vacation coming up or a limit on the number of pages that could be published.  This is the first review I've ever posted and I've done so to help others avoid this book.
0765325950|5.0|Light save us from these snivelling, self-absorbed e-readers! Anyway, if you've read this far in the series, I assume you care about how it all comes out, you've been along for the ride for thousands of pages (yes, pages, not files or screens!) So the real question is: does this book deliver?<br /><br />Yes. And in a way that very few series have been able to. Of course there is more war and violence and resolution that in the rest of the series put together, but much more than that, is that Jordan here is bringing back all of the interesting elements he has introduced over the series, especially since the Shadow Rising, and here we see them all woven together into a monstrously large tapestry.<br /><br />Starting in the Gathering Storm, we finally see the end of character story arcs, such as Rand's personality break, Perrin coming to terms with rulership, and Mat accepting, to a degree, a bit of responsibility. But much more than that, there is something here for almost every major character.<br /><br />What makes this series better than anything out there (with the exception of Tolkein and Martin, who are peers if nothing else) is that it isn't just good fantasy with a great world, history, and assortment of monsters and powers. It also has powerful character relationships and dilemmas.<br /><br />As for the very very very last chapter, completed by Jordan himself; it is truly perfect. SPOILERS: As the reader, you will be included in a very short list of people who actually know the fate of Rand al'Thor after the Last Battle. As far as I can figure, only four people actually know: Min, Elayne, Aviendha, and Alivia. The rest of the world believes him dead, and as far as that goes, he is. But we know otherwise, even if we don't know his name, or where he will go.<br /><br />I've been reading the series since 1995. Other than some of Sanderson's pretty crappy dialogue in some places, this book is a true wonder of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. If youhave to give a one star review and refuse to read it, then you NEVER CARED ABOUT THE STORY OR ROBERT JORDAN'S DECADES OF LONG WORK.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This is one of the most addictive CD's i have ever bought.<br />Sharon's voice is absolutely amazing and nothing like you have ever heard before. Sound quality is great. I bought all their CD's and I think this is by far the best. I haven't listened to any Nightwish (probably my favorite band so far) song since I bought this. The video clips are kind of goofy but the music is worth the money.<br />One day I made the mistake to go out for a jog and listen to this. I beat my 5 mile PR and I was sore for three days.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I grew up watching Star Wars (the original trilogy) which was my end-all be-all trilogy sets. However, that throne has been taken by Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. The films are utterly well-produced, well-written, well-edited pieces of art.<br /><br />This box set is simple and effective in giving the three movies and the bonus features that were included in the special editions with the single movie releases. That should be good enough for most fans.<br /><br />The only thing that irked me about this set is there is an insert telling you about the Ultimate Edition and that there is registration so you can buy whatever differences that are needed to 'upgrade' your edition to the Ultimate Edition. While it's nice that there is this option, I wish I had done a little research in case I wanted to buy the full Ultimate Edition. I had no idea it was coming out.
B000AJIAOO|4.0|Better than Mother Earth but not as good as Unforgiven (which would get 10 stars)<br />Overall an unbelievable band, creative, powerful and with an incredible voice to back it up.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I admit it. I gobble this stuff up. The Wool stories are good page-turners for those who share my bias. The central character is a clever, resourseful young woman who bucks bunker convention and helps uncover loads of buried secrets in this Orwellian underworld. Lots of claustrophobic suspense and quite a few unexpected plot twists.
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|I like that there is more music in the world now that the Robinson brothers are putting out stuff on their own but I pray it isn't at the cost of getting future Black Crowes music.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day One. Really? Day one? How about Epoch One? Which is about how long it takes to wade through this windy tale. There are about equal parts long inspired and unspired passages here. The details of this fantasy world are thoroughly worked out - a couple of hundred pages too thoroughly. In the end, I wasn't compelled to launch myself into the second installment. If you dig the finer points of alchemy and enchantments, however, you might enjoy this less-than-breezy ramble.

B000001G53|5.0|...only one recording of Parsifal, it would be this one. But it's a narrow margin above the Solti, and there are many things I prefer about Solti (his pacing, the audibility of minute details, the greater power of the brass section). But by virtue of sheer overall beauty, sublimely spiritual atmosphere and hair raising choral climaxes, Karajan wins! His strings are certainly the most gorgeous to be heard, and he also has the most beautiful and convincing bells. I've heard many recordings of this music drama (it is perhaps my favorite opera), and while some occasionally receive higher critical praise, I'd rather listen to these two repeatedly. The only one that approaches them (in my opinion) is Sinopoli on DVD.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This has everything that the classic movie ELF has with more. It has better video and sound quality because its a blu-ray. The picture is more defined and enjoyable I find on blu-ray movies compared to DVD. It has the same humor that ELF has always had. Its a classic Christmas movie for the family and kids every year. One of Will Ferrel's best movies by far. It has a few extra features as well which is a nice perc. I paid $9.50 for this and the retail stores like Bestbuy were charging way more. Overall, a great buy and nice stocking stuffer.

B002YIHO7I|3.0|I don't think this album was as bad as LOVERS ROCK but even then, I want to be clear that Sade has yet to produce an outright dog of a disc, but, truth be told, these last two efforts don't do her voice the justice it deserves. Take Sade's voice and lyrics out of the mix and the songs on SOLDIER OF LOVE and \\"Lovers...\\" just sound like your average Grade B pop songs. By the way, since when did Ms. Adu start \\"sampling\\" other people's songs? (\\"Wild, Wild, West\\", INDEED!)While I can understand an artist's wanting to expand and stretch the creative muscles, the problem is that Sade did this every time she sat down with an IPAD, memo pad, a sketch book or whatever she chose in which to write her songs--THERE WAS NO REASON TO CHANGE HER SOUND!<br /><br />\\"SOLDIER OF LOVE\\" is, admittedly, a good song but the problem is that it sounds like everybody else. Plug Alicia Keyes or even Fergie into that spot and it would sound bouncy and soulful, but it wouldn't matter one bit and it is questionable if the song would ever get more than occasional airplay ten years from now. When Sade first burst on the scene she was--different. No one knew what to make of her music: with its powerful lyrics, a mournful lead voice that could bring you to tears, and often did, and a contemporary, free-form jazz rhythm that was too \\"PoP\\" for Jazz stations but too \\"jazzy\\" for most Urban R+B stations--Sade soon found a niche within the Soft-Rock movement, right next to Sting! And like Sting, her music resisted pidgeon-holing--much to the delight of her millions of fans.<br /><br />\\"BRING ME HOME\\" reminds me of MY Sade, the one whose music helped me get over failed, past romances, but for me, this is the only song on this album that does this. The rest are decent tunes but Sade's music used to go beyond such a description, bordering on the heavenly. If I go to a restaurant, or a club or even a super-market and I hear SMOOTH OPERATOR or NOTHING CAN COME BETWEEN US it ALWAYS makes me smile, no matter whatemotional trials, rude cashiers or lazy waiters I may be dealing with at the time; I don't think too many of the songs from SOLDIER OF LOVE will do that for me. If it sounds harsh, it's only because I think she's better than this. She's lost none of her power lyrically and her voice is as wonderful as it's always been, but the back music just isn't helping her, it's just pulling her earthward like so much gravity--something she used to defy as if her voice had an angel's wings!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Love it or hate it, this film has kept people talking ever since it was released last summer. Obviously it's had a polarizing effect and everyone has an opinion, ranging from calling it a masterpiece to calling it one of the worst movies ever made. While I think calling Prometheus a masterpiece is a bit of a stretch, I do think it's a fantastic slice of sci-fi and it reminds me why I love the genre so much in the first place.<br /><br />Countless others have already talked about the stunning cinematography, great performances, and impressive atmosphere so I won't spend time reiterating those elements here. What really makes this film so engrossing is the questions it raises and, in many cases, leaves lingering long after the credits roll. Now this is precisely what so many filmgoers have been irked about and I certainly do not fault anyone for feeling shortchanged. We all expect different things from our films and I can understand why many left this one feeling disappointed. I won't deny that there are some plot holes and questionable moments; in the end they weren't enough to detract from the film, at least for me. Good sci-fi raises big questions and doesn't always answer them. The first time I saw Prometheus I was mesmerized and instantly began asking friends and family if they had seen it and what their interpretations were. After viewing it again I caught so many details that I had missed the first time around and in the process answered some of my own questions while raising a sizable amount of new ones. It's a joy to return to this film in the attempt to see what I've missed and to soak in the experience time and time again.<br /><br />This film is meant to be viewed and discussed. It's designed to to keep you on your toes and to spark your imagination, something that most Hollywood films these days won't do. I find it refreshing to have a film that encourages me to think for myself and explore instead of spoon-feeding everything to me. Prometheus isn't perfect and there are some inconsistencies that I can't ignore, as is the case with most films. Despite that, I'm simply having fun getting lost in the film and hearing what others have to say. That alone is worth the price of admission.ct and there are some inconsistencies that I can't ignore, as is the case with most films.

B007N8RULO|5.0|I play it all the time when I'm killing time waiting in a Dr.s office, etc. The version on my android phone is a little different than the one on my Kindle. I like the scoring better on the phone since it takes multiple things into consideration when calculating your score, not just cards played and number of moves. It also lets you choose games that other people have won, so that you know the game is winnable. That doesn't guarantee that you'll win it, though. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play solitaire.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Recently watched the first episode of Season 1 with my friend. It was a little slow but I decided to continue. Was definitely hooked by the second episode. Decided to view both Seasons 1 and 2 in order to catch up prior to Season 3 broadcast. Loved every episode and viewed them again. Really refreshing to note how extremely popular it is with today's audiences considering there is so much violent, inferior entertainment.<br /><br />This is such a Masterpiece. The acting is phenomenal! The writing is superlative. The story is provocative. Great acting, writing is top notch. The storylines are extremely compelling. Beautiful scenery, costumes are fabulous,wonderful characters, superb actors.<br /><br />Downton Abbey grabs your attention and never lets go. The characters have me so captivated I don't want it to end. Even the ones you love to hate. The family, the downstairs staff, guests, and relatives are thrilling! I laughed, I cried. Can't wait for more.<br /><br />There are far too many great performances to highlight them all. Beginning with Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern as Lord and Lady Grantham. He is such a kind, moral individual. Maggie Smith Countess of Grantham is curmudgeon perfection. Her battling with Penelope Wilton (Matthew's Mother) is purely delightful. Michelle Dockery, (Mary) as the eldest daughter, and Dan Stevens, (Matthew) as the new heir, carry much of the story and both are quite appealing. However, the relationship/romance between Brendan Coyle (Lord Grantham's Valet) and Joanne Froggatt (Head House Maid) is a special favorite of mine.<br /><br />There is a lot happening on this estate. Both upstairs and down. There is romance, cover-ups, villainy, manipulation, politics, and everything imaginable. Never a dull moment, thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />Did not take me long to purchase both Seasons 1 and 2 (original edition). The Christmas episode was definitely included. Some customer's stated it was omitted from whatever version they selected. Season 2 only played on my computer not the DVD. Believe it is formatted as dual layer and my DVD is an older model.<br /><br />BTW My friend got hooked as well. She is most definitely very resistant to this type of genre. I've known her for over 10 years and I was really shocked to hear this.ey selected. Season 2 only played on my computer not the DVD.

B00876TJ2E|5.0|Had not seen movie in many years, but recalled it being very entertaining.  Shared with our 12 year old son who also enjoyed it.  Some of the language early in the film may not be suitable for all.  Great movie though.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The Facebook app is not worth having.  I have mine uninstalled on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; tablet because this MOBILE app does not work worth a tinkers (you can finish the sentence).

B0056K4V04|3.0|As the other reviewer noted, the London/Decca Maazel/Cleveland recordings have MUCH better sound quality than the Sony recordings. It's also odd that the Brahms symphonies recorded by the Cleveland Orchestra and Maazel aren't included.<br />The RCA recordings in Bavaria, Berlin and Vienna feature excellent sound, and generally very good performances, especially Strauss and Stravinsky. At about $2 per disc, this set represents a good value. As a Cleveland Orchestra supporter, I regret that Maazel's best Cleveland recordings aren't here.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I've owned this in the past and liled it enough to get it again. Very clear vocal mic, but if you are looking for the warmth of a shure sm58, you'll still want an sm58. This is a great, reliable mic for things like open mics and backup. I'm going to use it for Native American flute, vocals and percussion.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Your like of this film is going to strictly depend on whether you like these Kinds of Broaday musicals and further,even if you do, if you can stand your cherished theater musical adapted to film.  It would be hard to imagine that anyone could do a better job than Tom Hooper has done for the film version.  I serisouly doubt any other filmmaker could do better.  We also have a dream cast.  Far from days when movie stars who couldn't sing were used in these movies, both Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway are known for their voices. (I don't know if anyone else can remember Elizabeth Taylor singing as the lead in the film musical adaptation of A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC.  Putting a non singer in the lead ruined it and now no one will remake the film.)<br /><br />A critical deicision was made NOT to prerecord the music but to sing it live and in performance.  What you lose in purity of voice, you gain in the emotion of performance. But this probably means that if you buy the album, you will likely buy the Broadway one.<br /><br />I think Russell Crowe does fine. I was actually surprised how well he did but, remember, he didn't have to hit the notes Hugh Jackman did.<br /><br />I think one really nice aspect is that now worldwide people will know that Hugh Jackman is a triple threat talent, i.e. he can act, sing and dance.  This is very rare and it is ironic that most viewers still think of him as Wolverine.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000YHG72E|4.0|Will Ferrell is great in this movie. This movie made me laugh several times. I ejoyed the movie, but it isn't a movie that I will probably watch again.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|The movie was great and it came in really good. I enjoyed it a lot. Just really good :): Really great

B007EECSFA|3.0|This book was good, and full of surprises. But I thought the book could have been shorter, without losing any of the necessary details for the story.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I love anything about Jack Reacher although this was not the best novel.  However I refuse to see Tom Cruise in the movie (many feel likewise) - prefer to visualise a 6ft 5 hero to really enjoy the book.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I love the Tinkerbell movies, and this one did not disappoint. I think this one may also be my favorite of the Tinkerbell Movies, and I recommend it to everyone, of all ages.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|As usual, I enjoy any books with our lovely Harry, just hope they keep coming and he's not forced into retirement.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie is great. It has a lot of action and adventure. It also has some surprises. I recommend this movie for older children as there are some parts that might scare some little children. The movie also makes some adult references that kind of surprised me..

B0011UJMK2|5.0|I spent the summer of 1966 in the Soviet Union:  Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.  The autor's portrayal of the duplicitious nature of the contradictions inherent in Soviet system of government and the way it treated its people.  It's a wonder that system lasted even 70 years.  Tom Rob Smith uses his knowledge of the Soviet Union to make a compelling series of stories.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|No real story, cheesy, one or two OK moments - kind of a 'Glee-ish' (which is a negative for me). really its a 2 1/2 star movie.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Bought this for our grandson who cannot get enough of it.  Good thing it is a cute, CLEAN storyline as he watches it every day
B001XUPF2O|5.0|Great movie. Gives good pretense to the dark night rises..I watched rises prior to the OG so now I am caught up. The OG is probably the better one although Jack Nicholson played a great joker in the OG, OG..
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I wasn't sure how much I was going to like this show, but all of my friends recommended I watch it, but I had to start from the first episode.  I'm glad I did!  This is a show about a very complex family, with any different stories. I'm now hooked!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy playing it so much, that I don't want to put it down. Good way to keep you occupied when you have spare time.
1574214276|5.0|This book explains Zentangle from start to finish.  The tangles demonstrated are easy to follow.  I like the side stories about how Zentangle has helped individuals in their lives.  I'm not new to Zentangle as I have been tangling off and on for several years but I still found this the best book I have purchased on the topic.  If you can only afford one book, this is the one you want.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a good game, nice change from others. I was surprised to see it for no charge - so I got it.
B0086900TI|1.0|I'm not sure what is the goal here. Social comment? Moralistic tale? The intentions seem noble but at the end of the day, this is a movie. And as a movie, it is not very good. If it was made as a documentary, with real people and real situations, then maybe the message would be clearer. But since it's not a documentary, I judge it as a film. Now take away all the camera effects, the voice over, all the freestyle editing and all the flashbacks and flash forwards, and you've got yourself about 30 minutes or so of real narrative story line. A depressed teacher with a dying father decides to help a young prostitute so that he can feel better about his miserable life. There was enough to make a genuine good film. But it wouldn't have been very original for it's been done several times before. One thing's for sure:  dressing the movie up with so much artificial artifacts isn't what will make it stand out on its own.  I almost took the DVD out after 20 minutes or so. Not only was it pretty depressing but also, it looked like the director was a young filmmaker, still studying in film school, and trying to impress everyone with all sort of technical devices. You're supposed to lose yourself in the story, not admire the director's craft. The actors are pretty convincing but I didn't really care for any of them. It's frustrating cause I wanted to. Everything was there. But the expertise of a director is to make us think that the poetry of a scene is happening on its own, not to force it on us by using all the tricks you've read in the film school manuals. D minus.
B001U887RE|5.0|These are a classic CROC favorite.  When my Mom wears out a pair, I have to get her new ones!
B009H2PCNC|5.0|Amazingly good.  Brian Eno at his best.  An absolutely lovely, interesting, beautiful work.  Buy this now, you'll be glad you did.
B0083TU61S|5.0|As an early childhood educator, I had read hundreds of children's books and always had favorites, but when introduced to Love You Forever, I knew it would always be one of my favorites. When I  first read it, I had a 2 year old son. When reading to him about the mother singing to her son (\\"I love you forever, I like you for always. As long as I'm living my baby you'll be.\\"), I would sing it to him in a melody that I made up.  Love You Forever was a \\"must read\\" every night during our bedtime preparations.  Since then, we've been blessed to add a daughter and another son to our family, and Love You Forever has been a cherished part of each of their childhoods.<br />Our original 1986 copy of the book was a paperback, and is very \\"loved\\" and bruised, but a very treasured part of our home.  A few years ago, my firstborn gave me a hardback copy as  a very special Christmas gift, but I treasure that dog eared original and think of the thousands of times it's been read over the last 26 years. Although I can quote the entire book by memory, I still get teary when the son sings back to his mother, and then to his own baby.<br />When I first started reading this book, my son was at the age of the little boy throwing things into the toilet.  Now he is soon to become a first time Daddy, and is making me a grandmother within the next few weeks. Thankfully, I am not quite as elderly as the mother in the book, but it is special to see how our life has mirrored many of its pages.<br />I think most families can relate to this wonderful story, and it is one that both young children and adults can relate to and enjoy.  I anticipate reading it to my grandchildren and continuing the tradition of telling them that I will always love them...forever!
B0063GORYU|3.0|Maybe it would be good with a larger screen. On the tablet it is not fun to play at all.

B00910Y1OQ|3.0|After reading the reviews I choose to buy the game. But then I found out it was very short. It only took me two weeks to beat
B0080GUX2Q|4.0|I really rather quite despise self-help books :) and I was not eager to read it but it was recommended to me by someone who knows what to read. And I am glad I did it, as a non-optimist. It is interesting to learn how the positive-thinking and goal-oriented world is wrong when it is explained with the help of scientific research... This book contains no revelations per se but it makes suprising connections between different aspects of life. And it is informative. I certainly hope a lot of people will read it and dwell on it.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman. Both intense actors! Together, they are unforgetable. A dark, realistic feeling, action packed movie that you won't soon forget. An instant classic. Do yourself a favor and add this to you collection!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Great as all the other seasons. I watch the same  old episodes over and over when the new ones aren't available, just love this show. Great show to see when in bad mood, seems to always make me laugh and gives you that little bit of a break you need when you're having a bad day.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Extremely well written and engaging.  I literally did not want to put it down.  You care about the characters in this book.  They are both strong and  succeed together to make there lives matter.  It had everything dramatic contemporary fiction dealing with  the issues described in the book should have  I found this book to have some uniqueness  + it was quite  original.  Not your typical romance.  It had a lot of heart.
B002RXVOX0|4.0|The story has been done countless times. This is my favorite simply because of the cast and the location. No need to go to the mountains of Transylvania keep it in England. Langela plays the role to a T. My late wife seemed to enjoy watching him. Hmm. Olivier as always is good. It's just a very good production of a well known story.
1579128149|5.0|This book takes the Periodic Table to a new high and has some of the most beautiful pictures of elements ever taken.  The explanations of each Element are sufficient for the casual interest, and I cannot impress upon the reader simply how beautiful the pictures are as well as how unique they are.  A great deal of creativity went into this work of Art and Science...  5/5 -BUY... BUY...BUY...
B00871C09S|5.0|I've loved Hitchcock movies since I was a teenager in Oklahoma. In this one you have Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. Not bad. The opening sequence that is done without dialog sets everything up. Snappy dialog does follow. Should he be so interested in the lives of his neighbors is a good point but he does solve a murder. Does it get any better? Maybe but not very often and certainly not recently.
B008D30K7E|3.0|Liked the idea. Not too happy with some of the historical sideshows. I know it is not meant to be historical but b52s attacking Japan?
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|Well C'mon it's frickken STAR TREK THE WRATH OF KHAN! How could you not love it! What is wrong with you people? Did you live under a rock? On Seti Alpha V? Maybe the starfleet core of engineers should've spent moths excavating your ears so you could hear the greatness of Genesis!<br />Don't make me take you into a Mutara Nebula!<br /><br />(but seriously; good restoration, no problems.)
0765325950|5.0|This book is a satisfying end to the series, resolving many (if not, perhaps, all!) of the long standing puzzles, prophecies and character arcs. Sanderson has done an admirable job in crafting it, as well as the previous two books, as well as maintaining the integrity of the characters - and well written action sequences!<br /><br />If you haven't read WoT, now you've got no excuse to get the series!
B004XANKVO|5.0|I purchased this for college because my prior backpack didn't last long and was bad on my back.  This has excellent support for your back with padding.  It is extremely well made, holds up to Thule standards.  This bag is the perfect size to fit 2-3 good size college text books, your laptop, tablet, and any other miscellaneous accessories.  My favorite part is the special hard case for sunglasses or other fragile things, why hasn't anyone thought of that sooner!  There is also a small rubber band that wraps around the enclosure for those items so you can put a lock on it.  By no means would this keep someone out but you would know if someone got in.  In all the best quality and versatility in a bag that I have ever owned.  Worth the money.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Considering how poorly it did at the box office, this movie is actually fairly good. It's kind of unfair that it was overlooked -either because of its unfortunate association with the Stallone movie or the fact that the company did very little in the way of promotion. Either way, check it out if you can. The movie premise is very similar to The Raid.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I wasn't sure about this season at first. Asylums and serial killers aren't really my thing. However, between Jessica Lange and Lily Rabe, the acting quality kept me coming back until the story really got its hooks into me. Once that happened, it's been a roller coaster ride of twists, turns and pure psychologically terrifying potboiler. Not for everyone, of course, but if you like a good mind bender, this is for you.
0062218867|5.0|The Discworld saga moves forward, atop the back of world-carrying elephants and turtle. In the dozens of volumes to date, Pratchett has kept the series fresh using a wealth of characters, a rich network of relationships between them, and a kaleidoscope way of changing his focus, volume by volume, to different characters, never letting the important ones be over-exposed or forgotten.<br /><br />So, this continuation centers on Vimes - the captain of the constabulary, recently become Duke by marriage and father by the usual means. Having grown up on the streets and having policed them for his whole adult life, the duking business does not come easily to him. But then, few things ever did and he works as hard at duking as he ever did at policing ...<br /><br />... Until the two duties become one. It seems that the lords and ladies of the countryside have had their will as law long enough to get used to it, to treat that as the only reasonable way to live their lives. (The other lives don't matter so much, do they?) But when a woman of the under-caste is brutally murdered and her people plead with Vimes for justice, duke takes back seat to cop.<br /><br />Once the story gets under way, it features all the best you expect of Pratchett: adventure, satire, and humor of many kinds, but with a biting social commentary underneath and a fiercely egalitarian approach to the many peoples of the Discworld.<br /><br />As much as I like this book, I found a few weaknesses in it. Normally, Pratchett's work easily invites the reader, like me, who's skipped a few volumes, into the thick of the plot. Previous books provide back-story but not pre-requisites for making sense of the storry. Vimes's relationship with Darkness seems to spring from nowhere in this book, a deus ex machina that the reader is expected to take for granted. Also, I found Vetinari weak. Normally the most brutally placid of tyrants, his late appearance in this book sounded whiny, quite unlike the usual glacial chill of his machinations and wit. So, I like it, I'll come back to it, and I'll look for more, but this isn't my favorite within the series.<br /><br />-- wiredweirdl of his machinations and wit.

0141329394|4.0|This might be the first title you think of when Sherlock Holmes comes to mind - and with good reason.

B006LSZECO|2.0|The auhor's writing is superb and the intricate plot moves swiftly--but perhaps the author tired of her story, Gone Girl,<br />at the end?  The reader is dropped with a thump when the wife of the protagonist is not brought to justice for<br />her serious crimes...&#34;Gone Girl&#34; was/is truly twisted and perhaps evil...the reader is teased with the idea of<br />her paying but, no, it is all dropped because she is pregnant...really?  She gets away with crime...most mystery<br />readers want satisfying conclusions except, of course, in real life this is often not possible,,,some great<br />literature ends with flawed, evil characters...but this book clunked shut and in spite of its &#34;fame&#34; I do not<br />rate it highly and am sorry I gave into press and bought the Kindle version. Gone Girl is now gone from<br />my reading list
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It is just like kinectimals but better I love it 5 stars.And the best part is it is free however kinectimals costs 99 cents.And that is why it is a must buy.
B009361C5O|5.0|I have an Asus Prime with 32 Gigs of memory and I do surf the web very frequently.  I had heard of AVG prior from my son-in-law who works in computers.  I knew it had the potential to take care of my needs.  It scans each time I download anything.  It also performs scans at set times or manually.  All in all it's very nice and the price was too cheep to worry about.  If it had turned out to be what I didn't want, I would have simply deleated the app.  I have had no trouble since installing it.
B00114RKT8|5.0|This motion picture is both entertaining and it will shed light on some historical and interesting knowledge. Definitely worth seeing.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|David Clark's subtitle, \\"How Epidemics Shaped Who We Are Today\\", is a good summary of this book's thesis. Many people who think that humans are the smartest, and greatest will be forced to rethink how \\"external\\" factors effect our actions.<br /><br />Rethinking is always a good thing for us.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am still reading the trilogy.  I am on the second book now, but I enjoyed what I have read so far.  I think the people that are complaining about this book is not meant for them to read in the first place.  I think they should read other books that are on this level before they start criticizing it.  I also feel the people who criticize this book do not like the sex that is done in this book.  This book is not for them.  I love this trilogy.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|A great book, allows the viewer of the movie to appreciate the depth of the characters in the book. Unless you had read the book questions remain about some of the characters and how they came to be.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love G5 games!  Very disappointed in the last few that came out, but glad to see they're back to making great games!
B006WXHJNU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and it's a great addition to my video library.  If you like super-hero fiction, action, and/or comics, then you'll enjoy this movie.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan Boyle is not attractive, or she does not have a great personality.  The only thing she has going for her is an extremely good voice.  When they allow he to sing, with minimum music, she is at her best.  Her version of &#34;Wild Horses&#34; is amazing.  The reason I did not give this album five stars, is that the producer did not have enough faith in her voice, and added to much music or choir to her songs.  Listen to most of her songs, the first half of the song is just her singing and minimum music.  The second half is over done orcherstration or choirs.  The first half of the songs are amazing, the second half is just average.  Just let Susam Boyle sing, and trust in her voice.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Honestly, I don't even want to waste my time thinking about what to say. It offered nothing except shallow insights and cheap sensation.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting. Once you figure out how they want you connect everything it gets pretty easy too.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I have read this book several times and it never gets dull.  DeMille's style of weaving truth and fiction is phenomenal.  John Corey's (the main character) sarcastic sense of humor actually makes me laugh out loud.  Truly one of my favorite books.  I highly recommend !!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Nothing too profound or deep, but a good quick read if you're looking for some entertaining fiction to offset other more serious or complex books you might be reading presently (Super Freakonomics in my case).
1451696191|5.0|After seeing the movie, I wanted more. I enjoyed the movie, however as with most adaptations some things<br />are left out of the movie. This is the case with Perks. If you loved the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book. It gives you an deeper understanding of the characters and is better than the movie, which I give 5 stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!  I laughed, I cried, I felt a million different emotions. I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!  I'm sad I read it so fast! This book is full of so much love and hope , after such devastation. Makes you a believer that the people who are in our lives are there for a reason!  This book is definitely worthy of reading again!
0393327345|5.0|This novel by Chuck Palahniuk was a great read. The book really displayed the dual nature of a man who believes he is insufficient and has been in a state of depression and insomnia because of the lack of meaning he feels he has in his life due to our modern culture. It is also portrayed throughout how flexible people can think as a group and how strict their devotion is to basic ideals.<br /><br />The Narrator plays a large roles in this movie. He is an everyday civilian who works at an unnamed car company that takes in recalls. The man has a case of insomnia and isn't included with a name throughout the entire book. When being asked his name he makes up a new one for every support group he joins. The narrator's subconscious aches for freedom which until he meets Tyler Durden, he finally finds all the attributes he's been lacking in himself,\\"Men look up to him and expect them to change their world. Tyler is capable and free and I am not\\" (Palahniuk 174). Later on, it isn't until the end of the book, the Narrator finds out who Tyler truly is.<br /><br />Tyler Durden works as a client who destroys businesses and abuses customers. As another job he also takes the leftover human fat from liposuction medical centers as a way of income to make his soap and create ingredients for bomb assembly which then is brought and introduced into his fight club. Tyler takes a huge part in the Narrator's life and reassures him that,\\"It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything\\" (70). This type of attitude is what makes the Narrator believe Tyler is a good leader. As the co-founder of fight club, Durden initiates the reason for the fight in which it started. Project Mayhem, which is later launched, consists of Durden and his affiliates fighting and attacking against consumerists. Tyler then starts to become an enemy against the Narrator towards the end of the story which brings an unexpected twist to the plot.<br /><br />In response to Michael Crane's (10/5/02)post, I would have to agree with what he said. The book really does reveal the hidden messages the film may have not provided. The Narrator is taken through an incredible journey of confusion and beatings only to find his true attributes. Without Tyler the story wouldn't be a whole, as he is the Narrators guide to finding life.<br /><br />\\"This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time\\" (29)<br />\\"Maybe self-improvement isn't the answer...Maybe self-destruction is the answer\\" (49)<br /><br />These two quotes capture Palahniuk's writing style in a very dark way but yet with some truth. I am a victim of liking this type of writing style because it is what holds a reader in. With a dark sense of reality it shows life isn't always bright, but is based off time which is always ticking; in that amount of time we must find who we really are. I would recommend this book to anyone who has seen the movie as it is a thrill ride of questions and multiple discoveries. As I said earlier, there are many different hidden details that the movie wasn't able to show and may only be acknowledged if have read the book.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is a great entertainer with a great voice.  I particularly love his ballads, but the entire CD is really good.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Not what I expected.  Good entertainment but the storyline and characters are a bit like Swiss cheese... Full of holes. Worth the $3.99 rental price but I wouldn't buy it.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This show is ssssssssssssssooooooooooooooo awesome!!!! I can not believe how good  this show is. It definitely is just as good if not better than the first season.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This book had great potential but just kept bombing at every turn!... I felt like I was reading about some really immature high school kids who liked to swear, drink and be gossipy annoying kids! I felt like Travis's character started out really good but it just got stupid when it came to Abby and his relationship. NO GUY IS THAT INTO A GIRL ESP. WITH HIS HISTORY!  Abby was a twit.... I wanted to punch her myself!
B0053O89XI|1.0|I ordered this product and found that it had 2 disc#1, 2 disc#2, one disc#3 and no disc 4 or 5.  I contacted Amazon, who sent a replacement that had THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  Likely a manufacturing error, but a huge one.  I can't believe that it was a coincidence.  They must have made this mistake on a lot of these sets.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This in a great way to pass the time. Touch the matching cubes and they disappear.  You can rotate the<br />cube by swiping it with your finger to find all your blocks. Looks really cool..still testing it out.
0399226907|5.0|this was a Christmas present for my great- nephew but I actually love this book myself I like how he eats thru everything
B0000073BG|5.0|This band is extremely talented. It disgusts me that radio wasn't playing this when it came out. I had to discover them on XM. I always loved Trip to the Fair but until you hear Scheherazade you haven't heard the full spectrum of the talents of Renaissance.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This isn't a reality show, this is moment in time in a person's life as it unfolded and  was documented by his filmmaker brother. Nev is a nice guy from New York who was duped by a lonely woman using FB, texting and phone calls from afar.  There are some wonderful moments in this documentary, made possible only by the willingness of the subjects, Nev and his 'love', who revealed so much during the unravelling of this mystery of who was really the beautiful 'Megan'.  Given what recently happened with the football player who was duped by a fake online girlfriend, this is an eye-opener and a cautionary tale.
B0060AY85C|5.0|If you've read any of Toni Morrison's works, you know she is an outstanding author.  I highly recommend reading Home.
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|Got through the first three with no trouble, then they put the door in and do not tell you how to get through the door way. Might be fun if there were some directions to the game,
B007KAJG3K|1.0|The movie is awesome! BUT do not buy this if you really want a digital copy to download. You won't get one. You have to register with Flixster (which I did not want to do) only to find out all I can do is stream it. That is not what I ordered. So I will watch it on the disc but will not buy Warner Brothers again. Very sad.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As everyone has heard it is a HOT book.... Might make you blush.  But this is really only in book one (the other books have the sex but it isn't a primary focus).  The story line is about a tormented man, how he finds release and a woman who possibly changes him.  I read all three books in a week and I am not a quick reader but was very captivated to find out what happens to Ana and Christian.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|interesting concept, slow at first, but I'm glad I kept going, it was worth it, not that I've ever not finished a book
B00003CXRM|2.0|I did not care at all for this movie. A friend had asked me to get it for him for Christmas, so we watched it together, and I just didn't like it . Thought it was boring.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|If you enjoy watching series-type entertainment, this is a great one to watch. Suspenseful drama, great cast and acting.  Must see!
0345803485|1.0|The only good thing I can say about this book is that since it was written on a 5th grade reading level it only took me about 2 and a half days to read it. So I really didn't waste THAT much time. But I will never get those 2 and a half days back.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A typical Nicholas Sparks book where some events are predictable, but there was a nice twist at the end. Overall a great story, and I'm looking forward to the movie!
B004Y042N8|5.0|I put this on my kindle fire and I enjoy this game a lot.  You get started and then you just want to keep trying to get farther.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Don't pass this movie up.  It may be a sleeper, but it is well worth watching.  The cast is fantastic.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Imaginative, intense, exciting, and funny.  Those are just some of the adjectives that apply to this novel.  It's very well written, especially for a first novel, which I understand it is.  I look forward to the sequel in 2014.  A definite must read for those who like fantasy without elves.  Terrific!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love history, and I felt drawn back in time reading the captivating story! I did not want this book to end! Can't wait for her next book!
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It was good hi propel you're not the vest the world of year to do ya the vest and all that much of the
B000I62JAK|5.0|This movie is really stupid but it makes me laugh and when I need a good laugh, stupid works for me.  Stiller and Wilson.  What a combo.
B0049GYXDQ|4.0|The family got to watch the movie over the Chhristmas/ New Year holidays. We basically liked the movie and enjoyed it. But I guess that once for 'me' was probably enough. Not sure if the rest of the family would be interested in watching it again. At least not real soon. But if you haven't seen it once and have young girls, I feel sure that they would enjoy it, as we did!
B007WMI1X2|5.0|I only wish this had been on the air when I was in school; all history classes should be taught in this sort of format.  Looking forward to Season 4 on DVD!
B005LAIISA|4.0|I've enjoyed all of Ice Age adventures. The first one is the best of course, but the sequences have managed to keep the action satiable.
B009IQ0TGM|3.0|I loved the previous Ellie Goulding albums, there was always a contagious song that was upbeat and lovely on the ears, but on this album, I just couldn't find a song that resonated with me. I guess if you're looking for something similar to &#34;Lights&#34; which I LOVE LOVE LOVE, I'm not sure if you'll find it here.
0061766089|4.0|Buy this book!<br />I also suggest reading it more than once. It promises. It delivers.<br />Working in a corporate environment possibly helps in terms of awareness of how much one can use the ideas/strategies etc outlined in the book.<br />Am about to read it again- this is my first purchase for 2013 and has been a success.
030746363X|5.0|Timothy Ferriss is so fun to learn with. Combine a comedian, with a mad scientist with obsessive compulsiveness and you have him. I learn so much. I laugh so much. Awesome info on so much: losing weight, building muscle, female orgasm, and more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its very interesting to me when I can listen to gods word and I would recommend it to love ones who have the audible
B007M45PMU|4.0|I recognized one of the songs after purchasing it, and have been enjoying the other tracks as well. All in all, a solid purchase.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|This movie is ok. Interesting that it is based on a true story. Bad guy is really bad. You can't wait until he gets his.<br /><br />The sub plot of the main character's love interest with a church going girl is a bit of a distraction and is underdeveloped. That aside, the movie is easy to watch
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is for anyone who even remotely likes to read and keeps you wanting to read more throughout the entire book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love all the Nicholas Sparks books but Safe Haven is one of my favorites! The perfect combination of love and suspense!
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I was hopefully when I got this and the power adapter, but it didnt work for my original kindle and I admit I was disappointed.  However, not too surpried since I was unsure if the kindle was what was causing the problem or if it was the power cord/adapter.  So after I got my new kindle I tried using this again with the new power adapter - it still didn't work.  now I don't kow if it was the cord or the adapter, but something didn't work, the new kindle does and it recharges with no problem using the cord/adapter that came with it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is an absolutely fabulous read. It touched on the differences between spirituality vs religion, as well as having faith. I really enjoyed this book.
