B00DQVST76|5.0|I just got mine today on dvd. I waited a very long time for it and had been reading negative reviews regarding both the blu ray and dvd. Thankfully mine sounds and looks great. I don't see why the quality of the picture is being bashed. It is clear and looks great and the sound is awesome. I wish I had been able to attend an MDNA show because the audience looks like they are having a blast. This film definitely captures Madonna at her best and proves that she is a hard worker and still a force to be reckoned with. Hopefully one day i'll be able to see her live. Till then I have this awesome dvd to get me by.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Whereas The luck of the Weissensteiners was about the struggles of the families dealing with being Jews during and after the war. This one had some struggles but it really to me was more of a love story. Which appealed to me because who doesn't like a good love story? This story took us to different places and we seen different types of characters. I am still not sure how I feel about Margit. On one end I can see how she could fall to the manipulations of her mother. On the other hand what she did in my eyes is unforgivable. I love Sebastian and Vera's characters. Also Mathilde and Theresa. Those two really were something else. Margit's mother and Sebastian's father on the other hand. I have no kind words for either one of them or their actions. Sebastian himself I loved. I love what a gentle soul he was. How sensitive and loving and forgiving he was. And how well he dealt with what life handed him. I think more people could learn a valuable life lesson from reading this book. This is a wonderful story about a person with great character and again I highly recommend people reading this book. there is a lot to be learned from Sebastian.
1572816295|5.0|This deck is beautiful, imaginative & the soft energy of it pulls you in to explore deeper. I am in the process of learning the rider waite tarot, having read intuitively with oracle decks for 15 years. This deck is loosely related to the rider waite & it been based on this deck. It is a wonderful deck to use & explore after having the rider waite under your belt. If you are seeking a deck which delivers the message in a soft creative way, this is a good one to choose.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I've been using this processor for more than a month and is been working flawlessly, I've played games like Diablo 3, Outlast in full graphics.<br /><br />I'd recommend this APU if you're on a budget and you only play casually and you don't need ultra graphics on all games.<br /><br />I've used Photoshop, Sony vegas pro 12 and this processor renders quick enough for casual use.<br />I'm was also using Corsair Corsair Vengeance 8 GB ( 2 x 4 GB ) DDR3 1600 MHz, one of my ram stick broke after 3 weeks of use and the difference is noticeable between 8 gb dual channel to 4 gb single channel.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved this story, much as I love most of what Neil Gaiman has written. His writing transports me to a world that feels familiar to me, one that I discovered in childhood. The world of dreams, fantasy, wild imaginings, other landscapes, witches, monsters, parents who don't understand you but love you, the joyous discovery of people who do understand you. All those things. He is in touch with his childhood, with his inner child, and that makes him a great writer in my opinion. He has not forgotten the moments of wonder, the simple experiences that impact heavily on a child's life. His writing is not for everyone; I've tried sharing some of his books with others, and they wonder why I liked them. I tell them, it's because I have not forgotten what it's like to be a child. I know my review doesn't tell you much about the story, but I don't want it to. I want you to pick up this book and read it, and just let it happen to you. I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed.

0691126658|3.0|After reading glowing reviews on Amazon, we chose this book over Zimmerman's [[ASIN:0691010226 Birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania]]. Initially, we were very excited about the book, beautiful birds, beautiful colors. But shortly after starting our birding in Kenya, we realized that the book was not very helpful as a field guide.<br /><br />Its main shortcoming is its inaccurate illustrations of birds. Often, the color is off, such as the blue of Blue flycatcher and of grey-headed kingfisher. The color differ quite a bit from the nature. African paradise flycatcher's eye ring is blue, in the book, it is grey. Plain-backed pipit's back is pale toupee in nature, but brown in the book. In addition to inaccurate colors, the shape are often wrong too. For example, larks look very exaggerated in the book, they simply do not match the general impression of the larks in the field. Bird ID in East Africa would be a real challenge, if one had to rely on this field guide.<br /><br />During our 2 week trip in Kenya (Lewa Downs, Lake Baringo, Kakamega forest, Masai Mara), we had at least 6 birding/game drive guides. All use Zimmerman's book for its better illustrations. So during the trip, we used our guides' book and left ours in the tent. People rightly complain about Zimmerman's poor organization, but in the end that is a minor issue compared to the accuracy of the drawings (do not expect too much from Zimmerman either though: the drawings are nowhere near as good as Sibley's or as in Birds of Europe by Svensson/Zetterstr&ouml;m/Mullarney) .

B00AEBB8XS|4.0|Although the graphic is not all that this is a great movie. It kept me in suspense. It's worth watching and owning.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|Hoped for better but ended up with a wasted few hours. By the end, I couldn't stand the main, male character Dex. Frankly, both of the females deserved him by the end of the movie. Ethan was the best and I was so glad he ended up without either one of them. I like to think he went out and got a real woman!

Everyone had moved on in their own ways, but this was a major reunion of Pranksters and kindred spirits.<br /><br />In the beginning it was Pig's band but by this time he was close to his death bed (you hear his voice in the intro to the video). Keith and Donna were new kids on the block (that is likely why they are not represented well in the video). Mickey had come and gone and had not yet returned. Bear's influence should not be underestimated, same said for Ken and Babbs'. It was hot as shit that day (particularly for Eugene). The venue is what has since become the parking lot for the Oregon Country Fair.<br /><br />It's like licorice: Either you like it or you don't.

B0021L8V1Q|1.0|The villain has a terrible russian accent.  Sounds like Ivan Drago from Rocky 4.  I would have fired every writer in the room who pitched this stupid idea.  But it gets even worse.  Lets give him some tattoos because thats really scary and dark.  I loved Marvel comics as a kid, but Marvel movies stink.

1416972250|5.0|This is a great series! I used to read the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton but as the series went on and it became overly sexually explicit and unecessary, this series was a great replacement. I love the characters, the plot, and the way the author crafts her world of Shadowhunters and Demons and Downworlders.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|It started off slow. I didn't know what I needed to do then it started and told you step by step what each thing was for in helping you. It's a little hard until you can  figure out what you are suppose to do. you need to hit the clue button a lot and of course it just gets you interested in it after just a little bit. THEN WHAM!!!!!!!you need to buy the rest to finish the mystery.
1416972242|5.0|I am not quite done with this book yet but I can't wait to crawl in bed every night to read the next chapter. Very impressed with the entire series and look forward to the next two books!

B00DMEQP46|5.0|MGMT'S third album is a excellent record, each track is unique from the other. Each track takes you on a different journey than the last. down from the synthesizer to the guitar the instruments are very textured,fun, and weird. Andrew's vocals are very textured and different from their last albums. The songs also remind  me of 80's synth pop. A lot of people will not like this album because it is very different from their past albums, my recommendation is that you go in with an open mind and appreciate for what it is and a stand alone album rather than comparing it with their other albums.  Favorite Tracks:  Alien Days  Cool Song No.2  Introception  Your Life is A Lie  Plenty Of Girls in The Sea  Overall if you are counting on an another Oracular Spectacular look somewhere else however if you go in with an open mind and a hint of Congratulations than you will like/love this album.

1449320104|5.0|Only about 200 pages in so far, but clearly one of the best programming books I've ever read. The authors clearly have a deep understanding of the material and explain it in a clear, concise (this is a nutshell book, after all) manner. Not for beginners, but anyone with intermediate to professional understanding/experience will consider a must have on the bookshelf.
B001BANK32|5.0|This book is one of the best books ever written by Stephen King. The fact that it takes place in a secluded creepy hotel makes all the more scarier. This book WILL NOT disappoint.

B00ECU2RGY|3.0|This was a pretty good movie.  Not much in the way of special effects.  I was expecting a more exciting movie.  It was easy to leave and go get something to eat without pausing the show.  If I can walk away without pausing then I probably won't watch it more than once.  Some movies you can watch 20 times and not get tired.  This one is not in that category.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As always great characterization by this author, but I especially loved his reminiscences about the 50's and 60's.  He captured the feeling of the times and brought back the good and the bad

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|i loved this movie its was interesting from the very start! the creator of this movie has an awesome imagination
1400034779|2.0|The HBO series was interesting enough, I thought the books might be worth reading.  I read the first in the series, not sure I will go any further. Admittedly, the book was kind of fun but it was like meringue - tasty but nothing really there. Simplistic stories. Cartoonish characters. Formulaic writing. HBO is to be saluted for putting some meat around the bones offered in the book.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child has written a believable novel- love his attention to detail!. I am impressed with the lack of profanity,<br />sexual content and gore, except as needed for the storyline. If this book is a good example of Lee Child's style,<br />Count me in.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|**This review contains several spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, be warned.**<br /><br />My husband and I ordered this movie with great trepidation due to an intense dislike of a many things in the first movie.  However, we decided to give this second movie a try as word of mouth was that it was much better.  It was and it wasn't.  Two of the major issues we had with the first movie were even more annoying in this movie.  Surprisingly, some of the casting choices we did not like in the first movie improved greatly in this one.<br /><br />What we loved:<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan.  Truly awesome and amazing.  He radiated menace and was utterly believable as this most famous of Star Trek villains.  I actually liked his version of Khan over Ricardo Montalbán's in many ways, meaning no insult to the late and beloved Mr. Montalbán.  The elegance and barely leashed menace that Benedict Cumberbatch brought to the role just took my breath away.  Plus the action scenes finally gave us a look at why the genetically engineered were so feared and why genetic manipulation was banned after the Eugenics War.  I cannot compliment him enough on his performance and I am now going to look into other works that he has been in.<br /><br />Chris Pine as Kirk.  I kind of liked him in the first movie but really learned to love him in this one.  He has matured as an actor and seems more comfortable in the role of Kirk.  This is not William Shatner's Kirk, this is Chris Pine's Kirk and I approve of how he has made the character his own.  And Kirk sacrificing himself for his crew, totally believable.  Loved how and why he did it.<br /><br />Karl Urban as McCoy.  Loved him in the first movie, loved him in this movie.  I've been a fan of Karl Urban since his days in Hercules and Xena and have never been disappointed with him in any movie or tv show I've seen him in.  There is no one who could have embraced the role of McCoy as well as he did.  My only complaint in regards to him is that there wasn't more McCoy.<br /><br />Bruce Greenwood as Christopher Pike.  He owned the role and his death brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Simon Pegg as Scotty.  I've never liked any of the movies Simon Pegg's been in though I did like him as Scotty in the first movie.  However, in this movie, I officially am now a fan and most definitely love him as Scotty.  He's made Scotty his own and you can believe that this is our beloved miracle worker.<br /><br />Anton Yelchin as Chekhov was again likeable and enjoyable.<br /><br />John Cho was actually good this time around.  Hated him with a passion in the first movie as he seemed so wooden and phoning it in.  This time around we got to see him actually enjoy his role and he did well.<br /><br />Alice Eve as Carol Marcus.  The beautiful Ms. Eve fits well into the cast and she did well in the story.  Have been a fan since Men in Black 3 and look forward to seeing her in future movies.<br /><br />Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus.  It's Peter Weller for goodness sake, what's not to like?  Crazy and very evil, a perfect villain.<br /><br />What we hated:<br /><br />Look, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's a....pregnant guppy?  What was J.J. Abrams smoking when he had them design the Enterprise as such a hideous parody?  Hated it in the first movie, despised it in this movie and was hoping that it was going away and they were going to redesign it after all the damage. But nope, ugly pregnant guppy lives...unfortunately.  And hey, it must be the guppy genes in the ship that allows it to go underwater.  Seriously?  Underwater?<br /><br />Zachary Quinto as Emo-Spock.  Shoot me now.  Loved Zachary Quinto as Sylar in Heroes.  Hate Zachary Quinto in the hot mess that he has made out of Spock.  How can someone who made such a truly evil, psychotic and menacing villain who was usually cold and in control in Sylar then make our beloved Vulcan into a intolerably whiny, often wooden and lost looking twit like Emo-Spock.Usually the first thing people I know universally say they hate about this and the first movie is Emo-Spock.  Too bad Kirk saved his life.  You know, when Spock is somehow able to withstand being literally on top of the lava inside an active volcano.  That is definitely some awesome technology that allows a person to be right there in the volcano literally right next to the lava and live yet cannot protect the non-living shuttle which was not right next to the lava but a distance above.  Right.  Uh huh.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana as Uhura.  Hey, let's inappropriately grope and kiss Emo-Spock while on duty, constantly.  Hey, let's let the communications officer beam down to help her whiny boyfriend beat up the villain, cause that's always believable.  The Enterprise doesn't need security guards, just Uhura, cause she is just that cool.  Not.  Ms. Saldana, while quite lovely, is just so over the top and unprofessional as Uhura she is like fingernails on a chalkboard.  The \\"romance\\" between Emo-Spock and Uhura is so forced and unbelievable it boggles the mind.<br /><br />Chekhov as the army swiss knife of officers.  Love the character, always enjoyed the humor of, \\"...it was a Russian invention...\\" aspect of Chekhov.  Like the actor who plays Chekhov.  Cannot believe for one minute that you would let your Chief Engineer resign and instead of promoting one of the numerous Starfleet engineers onboard to acting Chief Engineer, you assign...the navigator.  Yep.  Let's not let someone who spent years training to be an engineer do the job, let's let the navigator do it.  Obviously Starfleet needs better training if the best person for the position of Chief Engineer is not someone who works in engineering.<br /><br />Emo-Spock's \\"Khannnnnnnnnnn\\" after Kirk dies.  Gag.  Overact much?  Have I mentioned I viscerally hate Emo-Spock?<br /><br />McCoy channeling Dr. Mengele.  Exactly why would McCoy (a) have a dead tribble and (b) inject it with the villain's blood?  That's just ewww,oh so creepy.  Not that both my husband and I didn't immediately think, \\"Oh hey, I bet Khan's blood will be important later on in the movie and that it's going to bring that tribble and someone else back to life.  Nah, no one would telegraph a plot element like that cause that would be lazy writing.  But wait a minute, didn't Khan's blood do miraculous things at the beginning of the movie for that little girl also?  Nah, must be a coincidence.\\"<br /><br />Overall, a fairly fun but flawed movie.  Just ignore the entire beginning sequence on the primitives' planet, Emo-Spock, and Uhura and the movie becomes rather enjoyable.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|It's the original movie from '84, with a few special features, not very spectacular, but the movie is great. Not as good as the 2nd movie, but better than 3 & 4. It's a good precurser to what's to come.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|The Eagles have been my favorite band since I was a kid. Now they are my boys' favorite!  I have box sets and greatest hits, but I've never owned each individual original album. I like the price and the compactness of the set. I also strongly recommend the DVD: &#34;History of the Eagles&#34;. The bonus concert (though short) in this set is worth the purchase alone. I felt like I was in a time capsule watching my favorite band in their prime. If they put out a full vintage concert I'll jump on it.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|The season blu-ray is great. Better than Season 2's by a long shot. There are several episodes where the warp nacelle's color is purple instead of blue, but not too much, plus the live-action footage looks great with all the detail from the film they used to remaster the series. I recommend this set for all Trekkies looking for the best release for this series & in such a great format. You'll have a great time watching these episodes in HD. I know I do when I watch these.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game!I love how they made a game similar to temple run,which is another game I love,and added minions to it!

B008JF8O9M|1.0|This did not work at all on my kindle.Tried everything, help couldn't help. So I just got rid of it.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Yes, I say it, knowing how much flak I'm probably gonna get, also I've seen the 2nd-4th, 7th, 8th & 11th movies. It left me in awe, with how well it was written, acted, & directed. The only thing that could make it better, is an extra scene depicting Spock, Uhura, & Kahn beaming back up to the Enterprise after Spock knocks Kahn out, they rush him to sick bay, they unfreeze Kirk, take a sample of blood from Kahn, made the serum he did, injected it into Kirk, refroze Kahn, then faded into black with Spock asking if Kirk were all right & Bones answering \\"we'll see,\\" & we be given some indication of Kirk being revived, then we see Kirk in the med bay on Earth. Other than that, it's perfect. I was laughing for the 1st part of this movie, with all its jokes (Chekov being told to put on a red shirt) & possible callbacks to the original timeline (Wrath of Kahn, DS9, TOS, etc). Then s*** got real pretty quick & I enjoyed the hell out of the movie.  Now, for those that might complain about it not being perfect, what size stick is up your ass?  Possible topics for why you'd probably be mad;  1. It takes from Wrath of Kahn.  It parallels Wrath of Kahn, not steals from it. They even remind older fans of that movie, with Leonard Nimoy as original Spock, telling his younger alternate self about it. Also, what was Kirk supposed to do about the Enterprise, huh? Let it crash on Earth & have most to every person die on impact? No, he's James T. Kirk, he's not gonna let the Enterprise get destroyed, he's gonna save it no matter what.  2. Benedict Cumberbatch is white & British.  Kahn, being revived by admiral Marcus, could've been given plastic surgery, as well as an alias & his skin could've paled from being frozen for too long. As to why he's British instead of Hispanic in his accent, got me. His performance tells you he's a worthy successor to the original actor in every way, for the most part.  3. Spock gets too emotional  It's been almost 50 years of seeing Spock be as Vulcan & emotionless as possible. This alternate version of him has had s*** thrown at him since the last movie, where he lost his planet & mom. In this, he's sort of started adapting to human culture on Earth; starting to get jokes, insults, etc that are thrown at him, which his original self would've let fly over his pointed-eared head. He's also been bested by an equally inelegant adversary to himself, who's helped kill his friend & he feels the need to avenge him. So much, that he lets his Vulcan-fueled emotions run wild, as he chases Kahn down the streets & in the air in California, besting Kahn, only to be stopped when Uhura, his girlfriend in this timeline, tells him to stop because they need him to save Kirk. I feel his emotional release is perfectly called for, since now we see why Vulcans can't/shouldn't be allowed to express their emotions freely & regularly.    Overall, I find this movie great, as long as you're like me & feel that every era in Star Trek has their merits on their own & should only be judged upon the era it belongs to. Hope you found this at least slightly helpful in at least seeing this movie at least once, which I suggest you do, to see if you at least like it. Thanks for reading.

B001NAQJLA|5.0|WARNING! DivX format discs are not compatible with standard DVDs. They only work on DivX players.<br /><br />.<br />What we now know as Classic Star Trek (CST) began inauspiciously in 1964 with a [[ASIN:B00005QTAS failed pilot episode]], one that short-sighted NBC should have accepted outright. After major personnel changes and a new pilot, the show was given a green light. The Enterprise crew's \\"5-year mission\\" ended over a quarter-century later, when the cast of that original 1966-69 TV series had their last hurrah. The occasion was this feature film, STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY.<br /><br />Nicholas Meyer, who contributed to the script of and directed [[ASIN:B0000683DH STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN]]  (1982), performed the same duties for this farewell picture. Based on a Leonard Nimoy story, this is truly classic Star Trek, as Kirk and crew get down and dirty with the hated Klingons. Betrayal from within results in our favorite starship captain and medico being taken prisoner by an odiferous enemy. They're put on trial, convicted and sentenced to a life of hard labor on icy planet Rura Penthe, thrown in with a variety of aliens. Capt. Kirk even defeats one of these monsters in a fistfight.<br /><br />We'd seen it all before, yet this was our final bittersweet chance to experience such familiar thrills without watching a CST show rerun. Kudos to everyone involved for a superlative last effort. As this movie so clearly demonstrates, Classic Star Trek went out on top.<br /><br />TRULY THE END OF AN ERA:<br />This was the last motion picture for both DeForest Kelley and Mark Lenard (Sarek).<br />Within 48 hours of viewing the completed film, series creator Gene Roddenberry died.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.1) Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991) - William Shatner/Leonard Nimoy/DeForest Kelley/James Doohan/Walter Koenig/Nichelle Nichols/George Takei/Kim Cattrell/Mark Lenard/Grace Lee Whitney/Brock Peters/Christopher Plummer/Michael Dorn/Christian Slater/Iman (uncredited: Rene Auberjonois)race Lee Whitney/Brock Peters/Christopher Plummer/Michael Dorn/Christian Slater/Iman (uncredited: Rene Auberjonois)
B0042J6VUS|1.0|this tripod is made of cheap plastic & literally broke within 1 hour of my posession. after supergluing it back together, my problems still weren't solved. the tripod barely supports the weight of whatever cell phone you're using. i was in my balcony trying to make a cool stop motion vine with my phone attached to the tripod, when all of a sudden my phone along with the tripod fall 6 stories because the weight of my iphone caused the tripod to fall over. i now have a cheap, broken tripod & a shattered iphone. lol. i wasn't expecting this tripod to be extra durable, but i didn't think the material would be as cheap as it's price... just dont buy this tripod.
B00F6NKFQK|4.0|We all need laughter in our lives and Oleg Medvedkov makes sure we get it. Let's Conquer Paris is a humorous and irreverant look at the historic and cultural traditions that we hold dear. This book is a series of short stories that give us a daily dose of humor. The author's imagination knows no bounds. If you need a quick break from reality, this is what you should read. I want to thank the author for sending me a copy. These stories made my day.
1401938906|1.0|First off, this book receiving 4+ stars is absolutely rigged. I would not be surprised if all 500 of these positive reviews are buddies with pam, the author.<br /><br />After developing an interest in self help/ spirituality i've come to realize that most of it is a lot of hoo hah Bull. This book is no exception.<br /><br />Basic cliff notes of the book: energy is everywhere, you can control energy, you can control yourself, just put your mind to it.<br /><br />That's it! So much of this book is fluffed with quotes from notable figures which are so horribly loosely tied to the points Pam is trying to make that it's ridiculous.<br /><br />The writing style seems like it's geared toward pre- pubescent women: horrid fluff , terribad analogies and they're never ending!<br /><br />The author, pam, bashes god and religion throughout, which is ironic as this spirituality/ control your destiny so closely resembles religion and prayer. Like two sides of the same coin.<br /><br />Besides, if the \\"FP\\" is so so so real (which is probably stated 300 times in this book), why are you putting out all this bad energy toward religion, Pam? Won't it just come back ?

1609611543|5.0|For a used book , it's in very good condition.  I' finding it facinateing reading and makes good sense to me.  I expect to benefit from this read.
1932100660|5.0|I cannot give this book high enough praise!!  I could hardly believe that finally....after almost 40 years of searching....all of the bits and pieces of information that I have been able to eek out regarding the very obvious connection between diet and health...are finally here in one place.  Literally blew me away.  I have been fighting the established medical community for years because I have very different ideas about my own health care and have assumed responsibility for the choices that I made....which were always the right choices.  (Yes I am an almost 40 year vegan graduated from vegetarian and at 64 years old have zero health issues.) This amazing man stood tall and took the full and harsh punishment from those that stood to suffer financial losses if we stopped eating animal products and who all wanted to maintain the detrimental status quo (including the American Cancer Society...you really shouldn't be surprised,.... and numerous special interest groups related to the animal products industry)  The deliberate misinformation disseminated by these special interest groups  calculated to support their financial investments  (including cancer TREATMENT as opposed to prevention)is heinous. They spent years manipulating the system to their advantage and to the detriment of this nation's health.  (As an aside, do some homework on the history of Hormone Replacement Therapy and how the real long term consequences were suppressed for years so that money could be made.  The studies finally burst forth only because they could no longer be repressed)  I can only imagine what this scientist/author has gone through.  My single voyage through the medical \\"machine\\"  has been a constant, and often seriously hostile, battle for my own health (made even harder by the fact that I worked for a State Health Dept and was always at odds with current practice)  I chose to follow my own wisdom and the results of my research though and am so grateful that I did.  Forty years later Ifinally have physicians acknowledging that my choices were obviously good ones....and those choices specifically included NOT eating animal products.  For those of you who want an honest explanation of how cancer, diabetes and many other unnecessary degenerative diseases can be prevented and how they relate to food, you owe it to yourself to read this book.  The declining health of this nation....and the explosive costs associated with this decline...are about food.  If you chose to continue to eat a diet that is not good for you, that is certainly your choice....but at least be informed.  You may actually change your mind.  Thank you, thank you, thank you T. Colin Campbell....you are a courageous man and you literally almost brought me to tears!  May you live a long and healthy life!!<br /><br />PS  He also addressed the issue of osteoporosis...another bonanza for the drug companies.  A good book on that subject is \\"The Myth of Osteoporosis\\" by Gillian Sanson.  That was one of the toughest battles for me because everyone was doing their best to scare me into compliance ....and hawking Fosamax.  The first doctor literally pulled the rug out from under me....if only temporarily.  It took many weeks of research before my original peace of mind was restored.  That same doc almost went into seizures because I politely declined the Fosamax .. .lost benefits, I'm assuming.  No one could ever answer the question of tensile strength in bones....and they still can't.  I had to do a lot of research...both mainstream and alternative....before I found anyone who even acknowledged that it is as important, if not more so, than bone mineral density.  The only real honest answer I ever got from a physician...I do continue to ask the question....is that they do not have a way to measure it.  Why bother to find a way to measure tensile strength if you can convince people to take expensive drugs without it?  Gotta' read between the lines sometimes. Take the time to do your homework BEFORE you just accept treatment.  My use of physicians services mostly revolves around lab work....then I start my homework.  It has worked well for me.  Take care of yourself....no one else can, or will, do it as well.  You are a potential source of revenue for those who would benefit from your docile acceptance of their directives.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was so good. It definitely was one of the best books I've read in a long time. It was a page turner! Pat's dialogue gets you into his brain and connects you deeper with him and those around him. I'm about to watch the movie to see how it compares. But this is definitely one everyone should read. Definitely recommend it!

B00B89LZ4C|1.0|I bought this toy for my 8-year-old son, because he's hit the phase where dinosaurs aren't \\"cool\\" anymore and he wants toys with guns. The wife didn't like it, but she needs to understand that our son is not always going to be our little 3-year-old boy. Immediately after he took it out of the box to play with it, he informed me that he could not find the action figure. About 47 minutes later, we found the toy in an RV I don't remember buying, holding tiny baggies of blue rock candy with another toy I don't remember buying: An action figure of a young man in a hoodie too big for him. I figured my wife bought it, since it didn't have a gun, so I just let it slide. Fast forward a few weeks, I notice my son eating the blue rock candy more and more, almost obsessively. He didn't want to go to school, constantly begged for rock candy and rocked himself back and forth. I didn't know why, and I didn't know where he got the rock candy from, so I went in his room to see if I could find any. I look in his toybox to see the action figure staring up at me intensely, and I may just be hearing things, but I could have sworn it told me to stay out of its territory after pressing the \\"Try me\\" button on the back. Weeks past, and my son's rock candy habit is getting worse and worse. He refers to me as \\"Bitch\\" instead of Dad, saying he picked it up from the toy I thought my wife bought. Before long, more toys show up, including one of a black man telling me that I should provide for my family, and an elderly man who keeps threatening me. Weeks pass. The black man toy goes missing after I hear a loud bang from my son's room and see a smouldering hole in the carpet where he used to leave yet another toy of a man in a wheelchair. I ask my son what happens, he says that the \\"Heisenburg\\" action figure blew up the black action figure and the wheelchair man figure. I grounded him for lying, but each day his tales of what the \\"Heisenburg\\" toy is doing grow more and more outlandish and brutal.I may need to take him to see counselling. This toy is not a good influence on my son, and I doubt it will be on any other child.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun and challenging. - great way to keep yourself entertained. Would recommend this game to anyone who loves card games.

B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Jack Johnson returns to the sound we all love and expect from him. All the tracks feature the acoustic guitar, unlike his last 2 albums.<br />Track list-<br />1. I Got You- is a mid tempo song. A great start to the album and a very promising track!<br /><br />2. Washing Dishes- uniquely starts with a gust of wind, it is an up tempo song.<br /><br />3. Shot Reverse Shot- is an up tempo song. It is a great song to dance to and I personally can't wait to hear it in concert.<br /><br />4. Never Fade- is a mid tempo song. It will bring you down a peg after shot reverse shot. Never Fade is a great song to relax to after a hard day of work.<br /><br />5. Tape Deck- is an up tempo song. Jack uses it to tell a story about his roots.<br /><br />6. Don't Believe a Thing I Say- is a down tempo song. It explores the questions of the universe with a child like simplicity. It is my favorite song on this album.<br /><br />7. As I Was Saying- is a mid tempo song.<br /><br />8. You Remind Me of You- is a down tempo song. It is a perfect song to play to your child.<br /><br />9. Radiate- is an up tempo song.<br /><br />10. Ones and Zeros- has a beautiful chorus in the back ground. It is a down tempo song and one of the best songs on the cd.<br /><br />11. Change- is a down tempo song. It has the slowest pace of any track on the cd.<br /><br />12. Home- is a mid tempo song. A perfect close to the album, it is a beautiful song perfect to listen to with the one's you love.<br /><br />Recommendation- Highly recommended to any classic jack/ easy listening fans. It's a great album with the potential to reach the top of the charts and be remembered as Jack's best album yet
B00E3BK0QQ|1.0|:I  I really wanted to play. But for some odd reason it wouldn't download at all! I let it be for a whole day and it stop  wasn't done. I even erased some of my apps to play it x.x
B003V1WST6|5.0|I started my reading 'career' by reading the shopahaulic series so when I saw this series I jumped. I downloaded the book and found it was quick paced and had enough layers to keep me very interested straight through to the end of the book. The underlying story is a romantic little love story, which can be predictable, but the way it was layered I didn't find it boring. I actually really liked that there was a story with friends as well as the employment aspect and that the author didn't drop her past life at all. It's a beach read, or just a chic lit book, but well worth it.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|Really like it.  Gives correct artist, song title, CD and purchase opp.  Hold it to the TV and it states the artist, song title and TV show.<br />Lots of fun!
B000INAXGU|5.0|This is a fantastic dance CD, especially to shuffle in with the other funk in your collection. There are a couple of slower songs, but the majority are up-tempo (thank goodness) Jamiroquai should NOT venture into ballad territory in my opinion, but stick with what they do best- FUNK!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved Matched, and this sequel blew it's predecessor out of the water! After the initial groundwork was laid for the future dystopian world Cassia, Ky and Xander live in, this book picks up right where the first left off, and pushes this adventure into new realms of excitement. Following Cassia on her harrowing adventure to follow her heart and do what she knows is right, she finds shocks and betrayals around every corner, continually flipping her already warped life upside down.<br /><br />The characters we met in the first book of this series are all brought farther into the light with this book. Each seems to change dramatically, and make you question everything you thought you knew about them. They all grow and change, secrets are revealed, and all their lives are dramatically and irrevocably shifted. Just as in part one, I love them all. This book made me even more obsessed and attached to the three main characters than I was with Matched. A few side characters also returned in this sequel, as well as several new faces, all of who are just as wonderful as the rest.<br /><br />As in the first, the writing in this book is fantastic. Ally Condie does a fantastic job with the alternating POV between the three main characters, using a writing style I personally adore. It's fantastic to read the progressing story from different people's eyes, and get to know them all a bit better. Personally, I absolutely love this book, and this series, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys YA dystopian adventures, with mild romance.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Hard to install for AM3+ systems but worth the frustration. I lowered my AMD 8-core from 41 C with the stock cooler to 29 C idle. Under load my processor rarely goes over 40 C and I have never seen it above 45 C even when stress testing on OCCT for over 24 hours. With this heatsink I was able to OC my octacore from 3.5GHZ to 4.6GHZ without a hitch. This is still the flagship of traditional air cooled heatsink and the price tag is enough to make anyone passionate about this product.
B004GYY714|5.0|Full of features, must have for any person, better than any other radio app you can find on android or ios
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Very entertaining.  Couldn't put it down. Only problem I'm having is after passing the first 5 levels I was given the option of buying unlimited levels for. 99. Are there more levels or was I scammed?  Doesn't appear to go beyond the 5. Otherwise I would like my money refunded.
0739352989|4.0|+<br />I like the girl who reads the book and she makes the character of Ana very real.  However, I don't care for the way she does Christain's voice or the other male characters.  It would have been better to have a guy read those lines.

B00EZZ9W3C|5.0|A great voice singing some spellbinding songs. Heard the album on NPR while riding in the car. Ordered it immediately. This collection makes you fall in love with music all over again!
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|First things first.  The music is incredible.  Truly one of the best live recordings out there and a long time favorite.  The New Years Eve discs are outstanding with a very cool sound.  Haven't gotten to the DVD yet (never been a big fan of audio DVD as my stereo is nowhere near my television)  Now the gripe.  What is it with the Band and books accompanying their CD's?  I know Robbie Robertson holds himself and the legacy of the band in very high regard but this is too much.  The book and extravagant packaging (1 disc each on a 12x12 space... really?) only serve to jack up the price and get away from the original point- THE MUSIC!  So... I will watch/listen (hell, I don't know what) to the DVD once, flip through the book maybe twice and listen to the music a bunch.  Five Stars for the music... One Star for the pompous delivery.
B00E1SJDJG|5.0|Bill Callahan has released a number of truly great albums over the years, Knock Knock, Dongs Of Sevotion, A River Ain't Too Much To Love, Sometimes I Wish We Were An Eagle and Apocalypse. Dream River will go down as another one. At first I thought the arrangements on Dream River were a bit bleak. I'm not sure why,  but after spinning it a few times, they feel quite the opposite. Bill Callahan's gentle strums, Matt Kinsey's electric guitar that keeps creeping in to great effect, building the tension, the percussion from hand drums and brushes, fiddle, bass, organ and Beth Galiger's chirping flute, they all contribute to music of depth and beauty.  He's developed an original way of singing and is a master of making the lyrics  stick with his slow, laconic delivery, and short, almost unnotable pauses. He has  a gift for wordplay and phrasing, and can move you with the tiniest of gestures.  Standouts: The Sing, Javelin Unlanding, Small Plane, Ride My Arrow, Summer Painter.  A river ain't too much to love, that's how it seems, but I woke on a whaleheart on the river of dreams and found myself gazing at an eagle frozen in flight, sewn to the sky, it disappeared in the light.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I love this show! Its not for everyone, I get that. But I'm addicted. And being able to watch it online is great.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love the Chromecast it very easy to set up , and easy to use... waiting for support from hulu, pandora, amazon prime, then it will be the perfect ...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am so used to stuff like this not working when I buy it.  Roku was horrible, this gave me awesome quality HD signals on my big-screen TV.  And it apparently works with iPads and iPhones as well as other tablets.  I would HIGHLY reccomend this product.  Didn't have to provide a credit card or anything...works with anything that can download an App or which can run Chrome!  This things worked like it said it would on a 2.5 year old television...that is saying a LOT.  You will not be dissapointed.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This would be a great app if there weren't so many aggressive pop up ads particulary those from ebay some of which will only allow you to select a &quot;buy the item&quot; option. There is no other way to skip the ad without completely shutting down the Kindle. Ridiculous.
B00D2HTRVQ|4.0|This game is great. I have purchased all of the Dr Panda games for my 5 year old daughter as she really enjoys playing them. They are challenging but not so much that she gets frustrated or discouraged. I have even played them a few times and really enjoyed them! Highly recommend this and all the other Dr Panda games.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Since I was little, I listened to a lot of the soundtrack and watched the musicals. Though the musicals are brilliant and the singers from the musical were amazing, I never had that much of a connection to the plot and the musical itself.<br /><br />However, after watching this, I became so emotional and in love with everything, from all the songs and the characters, I just fell in love. The directing was brilliant, the acting was brilliant, and the emotions... the emotions :')<br /><br />I especially felt all the emotions from songs... like &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; (beautifully sang by Anne Hathaway) and &#34;Castle on a Cloud&#34; (also beautifully and wistfully sang by Isabelle Allen) and my personal favorite... &#34;On My Own&#34; by Samantha Barks.<br /><br />I am so obsessed with this movie, A MUST SEE
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was just what I was looking for. Even though it is similar to Fifty Shades, it has a different twist. If you are looking for that perfect book to fulfill your Fifty Shades need, look no more! Bared to You is perfect.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This one should be enjoyed by teens and adults.  It is a beautiful account of two teenagers who have different forms of cancer.  Their relationship develops... and no spoilers!  If you, like I was, are wondering what the fuss is all about, read it and see.  You won't be disappointed.  I look forward to reading more of John Green's work.
B002C6A6N6|2.0|Wife likes the show and I wanted to make her Happy Happy Happy so I bought it. The plan was she watches this in here room and I get hours of Play Station time. Then I here come watch this with me, Crappie I say. There is a spotless little town with spotless people who all get alone and when the do shoot a gun nobody get hit. The gay guy in the show with flowing locks that are never out of place and a 5hour shadow that never grows out. I tried that and I was told to shave. Sully can build a cabin in 3hours with a only a tomahawk. So I bought a bowie knife and ax. I was told it was not the same and to again go a shave. Men buy this item with care or you too could be trapped in a pile on the couch watching this junk and wishing for PS3 GTA or Medal of Honor. I should have gotten the Medal of Honor for sitting through this.

B00144VBBS|3.0|So Toby wanted to put out a new album for people that don't know how to use a I pod or what ever to down load music. So lets take the somgs you have done and people know by heart and burn it onto a cd and call it the biggest hits. I guess I would buy that, wait I did buy that.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I actually picked this book because Goodreads suggested the book, comparing it to other books I had read that I liked. After reading such a well written book, I feel inadequate in attempting to narrate my thoughts and feelings on the novel. Ultimately, a 5 star book throughout but the closure surrounding the final few chapters of the book seemed a little stretched and drawn out, without enough actual closure. It was good with lots of moments of great.

B007FZVWFA|1.0|There are some movies that are so bad, they are good entertainment. Then there are movies like this, which are so bad because they are just terrible. The acting is poor and the plot is  inept. The special effects look like they were done by amateurs on 10 year old laptops. I could find no redeeming value in this bad, bad cinema.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|This woman has a voice like no other!  I fell in love with her video, busted my PC speakers playing it so loud...  Now I have this to listen to in my car...
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|IMO FROM HERE TO NOW TO YOU seems like a throwback to Jack's earlier albums or in other words--it's a pretty laid back album.  However, the lyrics are much more personal and meaningful.  The \\"domesticated\\" side of Jack is coming out, such as doing dishes and stuff like that.  I like it, but I don't think it's one of his better albums.  My favorites are IN BETWEEN DREAMS and TO THE SEA.  I'm giving this album 4 stars because I like the lyrics a lot.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|This is such a fun and GREAT album to listen to - really like his style...  Have it in my car to listen to all the time...
B00DJYKFXG|4.0|. . . was Rock of Ages, and the two CD disk set previously released gave us nearly everything which wouldn't fit on the double LP in 1972.  Should you buy this? If you have the two disk version of Rock Of Ages you may not be getting much new here other than a disc of alternates on disk 3. The forth disc on the deluxe version is a DVD because it is 5.1 surround sound, not because it is a movie. The tracks chosen for Rock of Ages were what someone (Robbie?) felt were the best performances. I expect the reason the sequence is different here is that it is closer to the actual concerts. I bought the 2 disk version which is in one sense a rehash of the two disk set previously mentioned which came out a decade ago. All the performances are the same except the inclusion of Strawberry Wine.  What is different is the mastering- seems the horns are reduced in the mix so the Band is a bit clearer. Sound is brighter and more dynamic. These changes are either a good thing or bad considering your preference. I happened to love the way the horns blended in the early version. The sequencing is closer to the actual concerts than Rock Of Ages and the songs don't fade out. The overall feeling is it puts you there at the concert, which is what I want from a live disk. I was disappointed they skipped Robbie's intro where he introduces the horn section!  My guess is for this version, Robbie wants us to celebrate a great Band concert and not be distracted by the horns. For people who don't have Rock of Ages or just have the 1 disc CD check out the 2 disk option of this new release for less than $20. Great music and amazing performances. If you do have the older package and want to hear the concert differently the two disc version is worth it, but remember it is the same performances with different sound.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|One of the greatest albums ever put out...  I have the original sheet music from when this came out, used to be able to play some of it on the piano when I was younger...  This brings back so many memories of my youth...

1416955070|1.0|Just because a movie is made from a novel, doesn't mean it's a well written novel. This book is a definite example of that. I have not seen the movie and am not sure I care to, since I couldn't make myself finish the book. I usually only give a book until page 40 before deciding to dump it or keep reading. This one, however, I forced myself to continue reading quite a bit longer -- nearly half-way through. I kept thinking, \\"It has to get better. After all, they made a movie from it.\\" But, no. The author too often breaks up conversations with the main character's thoughts, and those interruptions are so long that I regularly had to go back to find out what the previous character had said. Writing that causes the reader to pull out of the story and have to reread a passage for clarification lacks skill. Also, there were a lot of the conversations that were simply relaying facts so the reader understood about this other world the main character's finding herself in; a skilled writer would reveal that world piece by piece so the reader wouldn't realize he's being fed the information.
B00EQNYOYU|3.0|Alt Nation on Sirius XM has been giving two tracks a lot of air play unfortunately they do not represent the rest of the album.  There are four songs where the musicality seems to have been forgotten.  Two of the three remixes are actually far better then the original versions.  That's not a good thing.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|this game sure keeps you or your child busy. it is addictive. good mind exercises. i recommend this game to everyone.

0812982622|4.0|The plot was kind of convoluted, but really interesting.  I learned a lot about North Korea, and loved the flow of his writing.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I got this book for very little money, so I wasn't expecting much.  I was pleasantly surprised!<br />I read this book just after finishing the last two Sookie Stackhouse books, and I immediately noticed the similarities between Sookie and Rose.  They have a lot in common, but are not exactly the same.  I really enjoyed the story, the mystery and the characters.<br />I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Sookie - but know that Rose is a much more sedate type of character and this book is not as graphic as Sookie.

B0044DEAUA|4.0|This device is easy to install and fits well on the visor.  The ease of use and quality of voice transmission are added benefits.  It is definitely worth the buy.  The only minor drawback is having to call the person before you start driving if you want to be completely hands free while driving.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love these people. I feel their joy, I feel their sadness, I feel their lives as if they were my own blood relations.<br /><br />MORE!!! MUCH MORE!!!! Puh-leazzzzze!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I highly recommend this trilogy for fans of the series The Hunger Games. It's great and very alluring! Great books!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I liked this game. The game started off easy but became challenging later on. The main game doesn't have an erase feature and I don't think it needs one. That's what makes it fun and challenging. It does have an erase feature in the sandbox free play feature.<br /><br /> Directions are simple and the game rules are really easy to follow when they change in a level. The graphics are simple yes, but how graphic do you need to be with a game about sugar? This was the free app of the day and I would recommend this game. Nice way to pass the time.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is the best movie i had seen in years, I first saw it in my Cinima class and just fell in love with it!

0446581356|3.0|Just as I was afraid. I want a book that really details how to handle make up  and how to handle problematic situations like making your make up last through a hot or humid day. There has to be tricks used to deal with situations like this, but this book really isn't much different from others that I have tried over the years. Its ok...
0062080237|5.0|I read Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch, and found it to be the most entertaining book I've ever read. When I told my nephew about it, he told me to read this one. This is not a book I would normally have read, I stick to non-fiction and humor, but this book pulled me in quickly and didn't let go. Philosophically similar to Terry Pratchett in so many ways, the characters are vibrant, decaying, alive, and dying, all at the same time and so vividly. Extra-entertaining for those who love to look at world religions and see some of it come to life, even if it's in a book. Highly recommended.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|Extremely well written and documented.  A real eye opener.  Easy read even for a layman.  Leaves you wondering who you can trust.
0060853972|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud when the story came together. Definitely the funniest book I've ever read. I've read most of Terry Pratchett's books, and only a little of Neil Gaiman's stuff, but together they're the best comedy duo, ever.
B00EU7PX7Y|5.0|\\"Gravity\\" is a fantastic score, one of my favorites of the year.  The early tracks have a lot of variety - some evoke a sense of thrills/danger, while others are very calm and fill the listener with a sense of wonder.  The tracks near the end of the album (particularly the final three tracks) seem to tie all the themes and emotions together in a way that is dazzling to the ears.  I've rarely enjoyed a film score this much on a first listen; and I feel the music will only get better the more you listen to it.<br /><br />At nearly 72 minutes in length, \\"Gravity\\" is a bit longer than most other soundtrack albums.  I say the more music the better.  In fact, since the movie is just over 90 minutes long, I'd guess we're getting a score here that's probably just about complete.<br /><br />At the time of this review, I haven't seen the film yet - but after hearing the soundtrack I'm even more excited to do so.<br /><br />EDIT: Have now seen the movie, it is fantastic.  The music has a very prominent role in the film, given the decision to use almost no sound effects.  Steve Price's score works very well in the film, but it's just as great to listen to on its own.<br /><br />FAVORITE TRACKS<br />[3] The Void<br />[9] Parachute<br />[15] Shenzou<br />[16] Gravity
B0095VPAVE|5.0|This is just a lovely CPU for the money. It is a perfect solution for my office computers, even when using two monitors!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This story felt very solid. Solid and good like a book made out of wood and steel, instead of the decoupaged  fiberboard and dowel construction of many other books I've come across lately in this genre. An entirely satisfying read. Although I'm a sucker for emotional character arcs, this book didn't have anything like that which worked for me. The characters were believable and did a fine job opening up the amazing mysteries of their world. But it felt like reading a very detailed account of what happened, and what happened is something you need to read. It's great.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This series is one of the best, most intelligent and thoroughly entertaining series on television.  It centers on Alicia Florrick, a lawyer working her way in a top law firm after being out of the workforce for many years.  She's married to Peter Florrick, a man driven by political ambition, who was caught with his pants down literally, after having had extra-marital affairs, including frequenting prostitutes.  He's in the process of resurrecting his tarnished reputation and realizing his desire to be Governor.  Alicia does an incredible balancing act between moving up in her own career, with all of its pitfalls and victories, while being the wronged wife who stands by her man in an attempt to salvage her badly damaged marriage.  She is, however, her own woman, bright, intuitive and total class.  I love this series.  Can hardly wait for the new season to begin!
B00DPY95D6|5.0|I was intrigued when I started reading Chomi Prag's Cult of Mirrors. What has caused the calamitous change in protagonist Cheryl Praetum's life, from successful attorney to victim of gang stalking?<br /><br />Cheryl's body is also undergoing alarming changes. Scratches are appearing that do not respond to treatment, and which come and go at random. Is this real? Or is Cheryl having a psychotic episode?<br /><br />The man in her life, Travis, is a bad influence and she needs to be free of him as he, due to his many vices, is having a terrible effect on her.<br /><br />Chomi Prag is an attorney which adds authenticity to her novel. In her professional capacity, she has personal experience of many of the happenings in her book.<br /><br />This is a very promising debut novel, combining as it does, courtroom drama and supernatural elements. I am looking forward to her next book.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|I liked the first part more but this also as the first lot of action and suspense as expected, i love it
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book so did not turn out the way I anticipated. As I began it, I couldn't have imagined the amazing twist that was coming. It's a must read on my list.
B008JFUO36|5.0|I loved the movie, lots of action and great suspense to the end, very good acting of Tom Cruise, was what I expected
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I'm not really sure I heard the value of having someone like Rick Rubin producing this album. These songs just don't have much energy. They were clearly looking to make them appealing to as many people as possible. Nothing wrong with that but the album is up and down with soft songs and attempts at heavier music.<br />There are only about 3 songs on here worth keeping.
0321934318|2.0|The book is well written, well illustrated, and well organized, which is to be expected as the author has been producing this type of user guide for many years. Adobe has added new image editing features to Lightroom over the years and this book is helpful in learning about these additions. As an Adobe customer one is forced to buy manuals from third parties as the people at Adobe are too greedy to provide even a basic manual and usually too cheap to even supply a DVD.<br /><br />Where this book falls short is in the other half of Lightroom which functions as a poor man's digital asset management (DAM) application. Once you setup LR you are pretty much stuck and the same applies to images that are imported. Scott Kelby devotes less than one page to how to use Lightroom for DAM. This may be OK for someone who only has a few thousand images with most of them related to family or hobbies or limited travel but for anyone who has many collections to organize and meta tag and sort by client or location or purpose as well as subject the book is a travesty. A cannot believe that Kelby is this lackadasical with managing the images for his own projects and he should have included his own methods.<br /><br />Use of Lightroom for managing thousands of image files, both pre and post processed, should include an integrated strategy for backing up the files and the catalogues and doing so as efficiently and effectively as possible. Data storage devices are dirt cheap but few people know how to create an effective setup and later find the they have lost irreplaceble pictures. It is a serious omission for a book using an application to manage ones image files. With RAID this can be an automated process done in the background but it needs to be setup with an understanding of the Lightroom workflow and that is why a book is important - if the author understands and explains the options available and how to integrate everything.<br /><br />Overall this is a very basic book that is for the most part only a user manual for processing images in Lightroom. Anyone wanting to implement a Lightroom DAM strategy or wanting to learn how to get the most out of LR's \\"develop\\" capabilities will need to look elsewhere.<br /><br />I have bought at least a dozen of Kelby's books over the years and this is definitely not the worst but it is far from his best effort. I suspect that most of the actual production work for the book was done by someone else and the next time Scott should hire a better ghost. There are numerous statements that are false such as EXIF data cannot be edited (which digital photographers have been doing for more than a decade), that are important as this is where the image's metadata is stored and key to how the filters work in Lightroom.<br /><br />Often Kelby's books are good enough to get the job done but not this one. After reading this book I bought the book Photoshop Lightroom 5 by Rob Sylvan and Nat Coalson. It provides at least four times the information on how to use Lightroom to organize your files and create collections and goes over workflow strategies that will get people started. Far superior book to the one by Kelby.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1118645219 Lightroom 5: Streamlining Your Digital Photography Process]]<br /><br />Kelby with his longstanding association with Adobe also encourages the use of DNG as a file format which is plain wrong. DNG is a proprietary Adobe file format that belongs to Adobe. It is only used by Adobe in its products and it does not contain all the information contained in cameras' native RAW files. Whenever I have a problem with Adobe's Camera RAW application coverting a RAW file I can instead use the Nikon or Canon RAW file processor and avoid the problem. If I spent the extra time to convert them to DNG I would lose this capability unless I kept both the original RAW files and the DNG conversions and then with the backups I would end up with 4 sets if files.<br /><br />Anytime I need files for a publication or graphics use they need to be in TIFF which is a universal open standard format for files that is used everywhere in the world and can be opened by every application and processed.<br /><br />This book is a good Lightroom Light book if all you want to use Lightroom for is image processing as a simpler tool in this one regard than Photoshop CS. If you want to use Lightroom for organizing and managing your image files then I recommend buying instead the book by Rob Sylvan. Rob Sylvan's book will require a greater investment of your time initially but the end result will be much better and it is a one time effort.tion or graphics use they need to be in TIFF which is a universal open standard format for files that is used everywhere in the world and can be opened by every application and processed.<br /><br />This book is a good Lightroom Light book if all you want to use Lightroom for is image processing as a simpler tool in this one regard than Photoshop CS.

Not much substance here. Not much, if any social awareness. This is the birth of what popular gangster rap would become in the 2000's.

B00D6BN9NK|3.0|If you really need an action movie to watch, I guess this isn't a terrible choice.  However, as the series continues, the quality decreases.  The action was a little bit corny and the plot was kind of bland.  The movie was just okay.

0670026557|5.0|Give and Take by Wharton professor Adam Grant is must reading for anyone who wants to understand how to relate to people. Grant divides relationships into three categories: givers, who give to others without expecting something in return; takers, who focus on getting from others without necessarily giving anything back; and matchers, people who seek to get something in return when they give. Professor Grant begins by asking who benefits the LEAST from such relationships and his answer is the givers. Then he asks who benefits the MOST and again his answer is the giver. The key is that , while in the short run a giver may lose out, in the long run he or she will be more successful. Grant goes on to give a number of examples of famous and not so famous people. He focuses to a large extent on persons in the Silicon Valley area of California.  He also makes clear how you can tell if someone is a giver, a taker, or a matcher.<br /><br />I found the book to be a valuable insight into why positive behaviors work out for the best. Many people may also find specific persons who can help them as the book lists a number of such persons and websites.  Thus while most of the discussion concerns professional persons the book can be beneficial for anyone in any situation.

B00BV1P8NG|5.0|This model is amazing, probably my favorite of the 6 funko figures that have came out, while it's labeled as a 'toy', you can't play with it as it's more of a model that you put on a shelf. Some things I've noticed with this model is that the tail seems way to big as it's much larger than the other 6 model's tails, as well (as with every other funko figure) there are seams in multiple places that (while barely visible from far away) can be annoying if you keep it close to where you sit or work.

B00E687MWQ|2.0|Ever heard of reverb? Learn to use it. Dryness is not conducive to a pleasant sounding album. Oh, and let's not fool ourselves, this is not some underground rehash of black metal strictly for black metal heads, it's just another album. It's produced badly, and mistakes are everywhere. This is not the gargage/basement style that made black metal famous, it's just poor judgment from Satyricon, again.<br />Are there worth while parts? Yes, to be sure, but not one full song worth remembering. The lyrics are often childish, repetitious, and have been heard before on other Satyricon albums. The drums are recorded in the usual lackluster fashion, flat and hollow sounding. The vocals, which I would've never guessed, are the worst part of the album. Too dry, too methodical, unrelenting strictness that never engages you but simply gets in the way. I was a big Satyr vocal fan in the past, and this just made me snicker. Bass? Did they have bass? I guess they did, but like so many bands before them, it's simply an effect.<br />Satyricon has still not been able to even slightly reproduce the majesty that was both Nemesis Divina and Rebel Extravaganza; two different albums, that sounded different and were pulled off extremely well. It's unfortunate because the talent and writing is there, I just believe some darkness has left them along with the power that comes with it. I believe they call it age. I hated to see them go, but they've departed.
0345404475|4.0|*Beyond the first few pages, I fell into the flow of the book and found myself very intrigued by the atmosphere, the depth, the ideas of psychological post-war effects.<br /><br />--The main characters are wistful beings, prone to deep self-examination and probing (or plaguing) thoughts of melancholy.--<br /><br />MOVIE VS. BOOK:<br /><br />I saw the film (Blade Runner) first a few years ago. (The theatrical directors cut-with no voice-over and my brother telling me all the interesting bits left out of the final movie.) I have always been more intrigued by the deep concept of the story and art style of the movie more than anything else about it.<br /><br />\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" is not like the movie \\"Blade Runner\\" in many ways. The movie is very limited, focusing on the android problem primarily. The book on the other hand delves deeper into the devastation and the plague of the human condition at its worse.<br /><br />WINNER: BOOK but both are interesting<br /><br />THE GOOD AND THE BAD:<br /><br />I have never read science-fiction fantasy post-apocalyptic fiction before so the explanation of futuristic technology, which crossed over so effortlessly into fantasy, confused me from the beginning. The abstract descriptions tapered off quickly and I read on with ease but towards the end it flared up again and I sadly didn't understand points of it.<br /><br />(At least four times while reading I was forced to pull away from the book and focus my mind because of an abrupt change in the story that left me a bit confused.)<br /><br />I really enjoyed the Idea of the book, the Artistry of the writing, and most of the story line.<br /><br />EXAMINATION:<br /><br />The book is focused less on androids and more on the human condition after great devastation and the huge advancement of technology that makes a person stop and wonder and wonder. To wonder of silence, loud silence, and to wonder of life, and of humanity. Personally, I like to wonder.<br /><br />As for the technology, I find some controversy relevant to comment on. We may not have androids. No, but there is a parallel of social devices.  Now-a-days, we have Facebook and other \\"social\\" media which unite us, conflict us, and estrange us. Technology is smart and amazing but it can harm us and get us into trouble. There is always a push and pull to human advancement.

1419705849|3.0|This book can be split into two sections:the first 50 pages cover Greg's early-early childhood (pre-diary) and then the rest of the book is about school, girls, and a dance.<br /><br />Greg Heffley has been increasingly more interested in girls as the series progresses, but he often quits his pursuit early. 'The Third Wheel' shows Greg as more focused and eager in his attempts to woo. Greg is even a bit more considerate of others although he still does things that also yield personal benefit.<br /><br />The first portion was kind of funny but I didn't care for story-line. The second half was better and more cohesive but not as humorous.<br /><br />I hate to critique these books. I really do like them but personally this one falls flat in many areas in contrast to the previous books.
0812550706|5.0|The first time I ready this book, I read it in one sitting.  I couldn't put it down.  It read like a first book but it was a very intriging story.  Some of the psychology for the age of the characters is off but as long as you can suspend some of your disbelief then its a great book.  I had to read it a second time before I go see the movie.

I love that this isn't a graphic novel but a book with illustrations.<br /><br />Greg Heffley is a young kid who is selfish and misguided in his reasoning and yet endearingly comical. I generally experience a sense of cognitive dissonance when faced with a main character whose morals are so contrary to my own, but I love Greg with all his faults. He makes me laugh at his ridiculous reasons for doing what he did and in some way he redeems himself.<br /><br />He is a kid finding his way in the world and it is a perfect story.

1419702238|3.0|3.5 stars overall.<br /><br />This book was definitely funny, but it was not as cohesive as its predecessors.<br /><br />The Negative:<br />\\"Cabin Fever\\" is filled with many anecdotes from Greg's past that is sometimes related to of his current-day issues. The anecdotes were generally funny stories but the book was a bit crowded with the sub-stories, especially when this book only covers a 3 months period. Also it seemed a bit odd that so much old information (like reflecting from last year, or even earlier that year) would have escaped the five previous books only to pop up in the 6th.(and there was a story about everything!) In the beginning the subjects felt a bit fragmented, jumping from different subjects.<br /><br />The Positive:<br />Regardless, this was a pretty funny book with a lot of great moments. The ending in this book was resolved better than some of the previous books.<br /><br />*Alfredo and the grapefruit was hilarious.*<br /><br />I love the Wimpy Kid series very much. I really enjoyed this book but not as much as the previous books.<br /><br />[Footnote: I forgot that the rating system on Goodreads is different than the one on Amazon. Three stars on Goodreads (where i originally post all my reviews) means 'Liked it'. On Amazon three stars only mean 'OK'.]

0375847227|5.0|MOVIE VS. BOOK:<br />WINNER: BOOK<br /><br />I finally read the book and I greatly enjoyed it. I wish this had been made into a successful movie series (or really a mini series-as most books should).<br /><br />A problem with this series is that it speaks some truths that many aren't ready for. It deals with religion and the freedom from its (sometimes) tyrannical behavior. Meaning some or most will not give this series a chance.<br /><br />Story: The basic idea of this story is that children are born with something genuinely special (personified by a animal companion). And then begins a movement that causes the Adults to want to take that special-ness away. It is more complicated. The series pushes comfortable boundaries while adding in elements of fantasy and humor, and pain. It truly deals with so many subjects and elements. The world illustrated in his writings is wonderful and amazing.<br /><br />--I think it's worth the read no matter what you believe. Sometimes religion (or lack there of) has nothing to do with morals (or lack there of)--

B002EMESSM|4.0|Being this is the first Star Trek movie, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a decent movie on a rainy weekend. I hated the uniforms in this movie. I don't know why they switched from the regular Star Fleet uniforms to these that look so sloppy and unprofessional.
B000059MEL|5.0|Discovery is by far the best Daft Punk album and hearing it on vinyl and having it physically in my hands is like nothing I've experienced before. It has a crisp sound and is just all around pleasing. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of art because to, me, that is part of the experience when playing and purchasing vinyl records. I definitely recommend getting it though if you like Daft Punk and have a turntable lying around. You will not be disappointed sound and quality-wise.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Love that I can set the alarm, turn off my kindle, and it turns itself on and goes off to my music!
B00DMEQP46|1.0|What indie niche are these guys trying to fill? I do understand that artist do try to evolve with their music but to the point where they despise their own fans for insisting on hearing their older material at live shows! This should give them a clue of what the fans want. Fortunately, we have Empire of the Sun, they've manage to hit that weird/pop indie that it seems MGMT is trying to find but has yet to figure out.<br /><br />edit: I've been reading reviews and to no suprise low to mediocre scores for this album. I truly don't understand how you guys on amazon are able to give 4-5 perfect scores?
1476715904|4.0|After the last book I abandoned, I needed a book rebound and Slammed totally fit the bill. I laughed and cried and got chills and swooned. I was exasperated and then swept away. My heart skipped a few beats. It's a love story, but there is more going on than just the star-crossed lovers. It's a book about growing up too fast and learning to accept your fate. All in all it is a genuinely good book that takes you on a roller-coaster of emotions with characters you actually care about.
B00F35B8F8|1.0|The movie paused every 7 seconds for loading. The loading screens were longer than the few seconds of play time in between loads. After 30 minutes, I went out to the store and bought the DVD. The rental was a complete waste of money.<br /><br />Only gave 1 star because the review screen will not let you give NO STARS as I would have done.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie had all the excitement I could stand. I love magic shows, magicians and magic stories. I love when someone explains the magic tricks. This movie had it all and I hope there is a sequel. The actors were great and special effects amazing.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A lot of this book was very easy to tell what was going to happen. The description kind of gave it away. I mean three woman joined by something it was obvious. The best part of this book was the epilogue not because I was eager to finish the book, because it was still a good book, but because it explained and tied up a lot of lose ends.
B0055PMURG|5.0|This girl is amazing!! This movie is full of inspiration and filled with faithful foundations. Thank you for sharing your story with us all Bethany.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great fun, I love minions! My son can't wait to play, he says it looks better then Temple Run. I like the fat it has different areas to go to
B005TBN3EU|2.0|Loved the first Hangover movie, so when I watched The Hangover II I was disappointed.  Goes to show don't mess with a good thing.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|its cool and fun to play and to destroy other toys and be toys and now finish hopefully i just want coins
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This movie was just ok. The action and dialogue could have been better. Good enough to pass the time on my flight.
B00CPTUNBK|3.0|I didn't really expect that much on a BluRay aimed at kids, but the extras were terrible and the presentation is too simple, though I liked the detail on the cardboard cover. It's something.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|This is by far the best dj app there has ever been<br />I have recommended this to all of my friends and they all have it
0316247545|5.0|A must-have for fans, with a nice presentation and tons of content, from a character list to a guide of every episode in the first three seasons, and also the lyrics for all the songs, artworks, comments from the staff... pure gold.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a fun and educational game with caricatures that children are familiar with. Anyone that likes fish tanks or observing fish will enjoy this application.
B0073B587E|4.0|I've had mine for a few days now, and I like it so much I just ordered a second one to hack on.<br /><br />As a device to learn how to play the guitar, it's of questionable value.  Even if you already play the guitar, this thing takes a while to adjust to -- the only thing in common with a guitar is the chord shapes you \\"fret\\" with.  However, it does come with a voucher that allows you to download a pack of 10 songs, and those songs will light up the fretboard as they play.  That gives you a shortcut to figuring out the chords (tab would be better), and there is a feature to slow down the songs to make playing along easier as you learn the songs.<br /><br />The All-star app is nicely done.  However, where this toy really shines is as a midi controller for Garage Band and the like.  There is very little latency.<br /><br />There are a couple of misfeatures that keep this thing in the toy realm: no outputs (either analog or digital), no inputs (a way to charge the iPad while docked would be nice), and the neck is way too flimsy -- it twists as you play.<br /><br />So I bought a second one to see if I can address some of these issues.  It shouldn't be too hard to either stiffen the neck or make a new neck, and others have already added a sound-out port to theirs.<br /><br />I doubt we'll ever see a device this cool and this cheap again.  Stock up.  Maybe they'll become collectible one day, like the kitara.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This is the best stylus I have found so far. I have to use a stylus on both my cell phone and my Kindle Fire due to my hand tremors from my meds. This one has three different size daubers which is very helpful. The large dauber is used to turn pages in a book. But the smallest dauber is extremely useful for getting into those small areas without having to use your fingers to expand the screen.
0307592731|3.0|Story about an inexperience, woman of questionable emotional stability who goes on a hike into the wilderness alone.  Thought the woman was foolish for taking on such a potentially dangerous adventure without benefit of experience or guidance from someone more knowledgeable in the outdoors, hiking, etc.  Did not like it too very much.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am glad to find its a series! What it may lack in technical correctness, it makes up for with fun characters, a chilling plot and overall entertainment value. Loved it!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The idea of Jesus the Christ as we learned it in our churches and adopted Christianity as &#34;reality&#34; is informed by aslan as a group of myths, constructed with a political agenda in mind: pretending Jesus was not a piece of Jewish history and a convenient trope upon which to build a new version of empire.  Blaming the Jews for the death of Jesus was something I learned in Sunday School, along with other hateful views of others.  Here's to atheism and the careful study of history, our best hopes for saving humankind.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|One of the best Mel Gibson movies out there.  Has an all star cast and many character actors. Surprise ending.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Excellent reader. One small section did not read aloud. And it was free! Very much worth reading with insight into the human spirit.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I liked the first one with this cast but really think this is a better movie.  The last one set the time table but this one sets the characters and usually the first movie in a series does that which makes it the one to top.  This will be the one to top now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it on my ipod and I love it the updates might be a little dumb but its still great
B008JFUO4U|4.0|The movie was very good and enjoyable and I liked that it was a different aspect of an alien invasion.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I've always been a fan, and my wife likes it too! I characterize it as a western in space. For new viewers: get past the first 15 minutes - the style of the show is totally different, and its awesome.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book. Great story line. I love romantic books so this is now my favorite. Absolutely the best.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Wasn't a huge David Baldacci fan, but I recently began watching the tv show. Now, as I'm sure everyone agrees, the books are usually better, so I bought them all (as I like to read an entire series). This first book was a \\"can't put down\\" nail biter. I even read at work. I love to read this genre and can generally figure out the ending early on........except with this book. It kept me intrigued and guessing.  I can't wait to read the remaining books in the series and am dying to know how Edgar plays into the concept of King and Maxwell.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A quick read you will enjoy. You will search your inner self for traces of the story characters and events.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Easy to read with not a whole lot of scientific mumbo jumbo to weed through.  Been on the diet for 2 weeks and have lost 7 lbs, feeling great and sleeping better, I'm hoping to get off my blood pressure medication when I see the doctor next month.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|The story line was good. Even though figuring out who did it was easy, how it ended was not what I figured. That is a good thing.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I found it hard to believe that two sheets of newspaper would get the charcoal going, but it works. My only mistake was not buying the larger model. I always seem to fall short of enough coals to use full area of my 22 inch grill, with this smaller unit.
0553278398|5.0|I ventured out to read the Foundation books not in the order they were written but in the order that they should be read in.  I am a fairly recent convert to Sci-Fi.  I can find no fault with this book and maybe that is because I didn't read the Foundation trilogy.  Yeah, I had it on my book shelves for many years been never read more than the first page.  Now that I have met Hari, I want to follow him on this journey.  Isn't that what great writing does?  I think this is great sci-fi writing.  The intelligence of Issac Asimov permeates each page.  I don't want to give any of the story away, but the beginning was satisfying and so is where he chose to end it.  I highly recommend this work, it is terrific story-telling.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This is seriously the best zombie movie I have seen in years!<br />I'm also not a Brad Pitt fan, but he did amazing in this movie and actually made me reconsider my disinterest in him.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|When you look deeper into the meaning of the book, the message is really about being able to make your own choices and to never settle for anything less than you desire.<br /><br />Both Louisa and Will had choices to make about their own lives and the quality of life that they each wanted for themselves and each other.  Through her relationship with Will, Louisa realized that she wanted more for her own life than to be just a caregiver--even though she would have done it willingly just to be with Will.  In the same token, Will had wanted more for himself than to be trapped in a life that he was no longer happy with and having to be reliant on others to take care of him was slowly diminishing his quality of life. He wanted nothing less than the &#34;big life&#34; that he used to have, knowing that it would be impossible to get it back.<br /><br />In the end, they ultimately made choices for themselves that would set them free.  Choices that finally allowed them both to live, not for others, but for themselves.

0385528787|5.0|In MADDADDAM, Margaret Atwood returns to the terrifying vision of the future she first imagined in ORYX AND CRAKE and further explored in THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD, concluding this spectacular trilogy. In it, she examines the fragility of nature, the dangers of power, the risks of science, and the meaning and limits of humanity.<br /><br />It has been a few months since the pandemic called the Waterless Flood devastated most of life on earth. A few people have survived, along with a variety of genetically modified animals and a strange new human species called the Crakers. ORYX AND CRAKE told the story of the scientific genius Crake, his muse Oryx, and their plans to create a new race of people who lack destructive impulses. THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD told the story of Adam One, a religious leader who tried to bring his followers comfort and hope during the pandemic that Crake unleashed on the world, and of Toby and Ren, two women who were victims of the brutality and malfeasance that characterized society's breakdown.<br /><br />MADDADDAM brings those stories together in the aftermath of the violence of the Waterless Flood and the corruption-filled decades that led up to it by centering on Toby and a few other characters from the first two books. Toby, having survived the pandemic holed up in the AnooYoo Spa, has joined survivors from both the Gardeners, the nature-focused religious group founded by Adam One, and the MaddAddamites, bio and tech geniuses who formed an underground resistance against the nefarious CorpSeCorps. The Crakers, bio-engineered humans with a simplistic worldview but lusty sexual appetites, are also on-hand, having followed Jimmy, a friend of Crake's from the Paradice Dome where they were created and Crake perished. But they are all far from safe as raping and murdering Painballers are circling their barely protected compound, and Pigoons, pigs bred for human organ and tissue replacement, are menacing them as well.<br /><br />Of course, it all soundsconfusing if you haven't read the first two books, so losing yourself in Atwood's nightmarish and intelligent world from start to finish is recommended. MADDADDAM exhibits the clever word play and mistrust of science and technology for profit and power that Atwood began presenting in the other installments of the trilogy, as well as another one of the author's characteristic subjects: the treatment of women. Toby is a strong and sympathetic character, and through her and her lover, Zeb, Atwood is able to fill in a lot of the holes in the story the other books didn't address. Here we find out the backstory of Adam One and his relationship to Zeb, along with Zeb's own tale and what has happened to the Children of Crake since they left the Paradice Dome. We also catch up with Ren and Amanda, who were important figures in THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD.<br /><br />Most interesting in this book, however, is not the characters dealing with the new world in which they find themselves (though that is really great, too), but the development of the Craker character named Bluebeard, who comes to stand for all Crakers as they come out of the Eden of their creation into a harsh and unpredictable climate. Also especially interesting is the theme of storytelling. MADDADDAM is mostly Toby's story, but she tells Zeb's as well (to the Children of Crake, who in turn make storytelling part of their own culture), and in the end, she, with the help of Bluebeard, has left a story as a legacy and as a guide for the survivors of the Waterless Flood. Myth and mythmaking are important to any culture, and Atwood uses that idea to say something about survival and regeneration being more than purely physical processes.<br /><br />MADDADDAM concludes one of the most compelling and unique visions of the future (and the present, really) in recent literature. It is about extinction and dissolution, as well as reparation and restructuring. It is a novel not without hope but is a hope tinged with uncertainty and anxiety. Sometimes far-fetched and other times bleakly realistic, Atwood's latest is a fascinating and entertaining conclusion to her chilling series.<br /><br />Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|I can't believe that I have never come across this book before. Amazing find! This collection is truly unique. These short stories are very creative and vivid. The female characters are complex, strong and interesting. Rossi is an incredible story teller. Magnificent!
B001ILFUD2|5.0|I am trying to collect all the movies I had when I was younger and of course, this was part of the list. This was great for the price. My son loves this movie.

B00DLKXF3A|5.0|A7X is one of my 5 favorite bands, and I have been waiting far too long for the new album. At first I thought this album was watered down and boring. One of the hallmarks of A7X has always been the complicated drum fills courtesy of The Rev, none of which were present. But the boys had a plan and it really worked. Drawing inspiration from classic metal bands such as Metallica, Iron Maiden, GNR, Megadeth, Pantera, etc - their intention was to pay tribute to the bands they grew up on.<br /><br />This album is fantastic from start to finish - its now my favorite A7X cd - and yes I love all the old ones especially City of Evil. Every single song is solid and stands on its own yet seems like a logical next chapter. Some of the songs sound like Metallica/GNR, but at the same time they still have the A7X twist.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear these incredible songs in a couple of weeks live. A7x foREVer!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I hadn't been playing this game in a very long time. Having is this handy, I get to enjoy it often. Makes me feel good when I win.
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was not as good as the first one, however it was still entertaining.  It is worth reading if you enjoyed the first book.
0131480057|4.0|Excellent book.  The Kindle edition code examples are very, very small compared to the text.  I have really good eyesight and this leads to strain for me, making reading it on Kindle an unpleasant experience.
B00BEIYOHC|2.0|First a few things. 1. I really enjoyed Insidious Chapter One. 2. I think James Wan is a great Director. 3. I actually liked The Conjuring. Ok, now down to the details. Im kinda puzzled by the large amount of great reviews on this film. Take a look at the pros and cons list.<br /><br />Pros<br />+All The Same actors/writers/director return for the sequel<br />+3 Scenes in the film worth atleast watching once<br /><br />Cons<br />-Weak storyline<br />-Not frightening at all (the first was done really well and gave me a run for my money a few times)<br />-Comedy was over done (Not here and there to keep things a little light, but like in every scene)<br />-NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE FURTHER! (Just like the hellraiser series, give us more PINHEAD! Seriously tho, the first film was paced great and the sequel follows the same pacing?! Its the sequel, supposed to have more of what the first lacked? More of The Further is what I came for and didnt get)<br />-Same old Same old, if you have been watching horror films for a few years you will see half the film done over many times. I got bored with it, predictable.<br /><br />All in all, its worth watching once. I wouldnt buy just rent or go check out in the theaters. In Theory, if you liked the first then you WONT like the second due to the fact that all the things that made the first great where missing in the second. **Dear Internet Trolls, I dont care to hear your opinion. This is my opinion, im sorry if you dont agree**
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this classic game! now I don't have to keep track of all the cards! or force the kids to join me.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|One of the best apps I have ever gotten for my galaxy s4. Another huge plus was I got it for FREE!!!! I believe it would be worth the money though.
B00AFEY354|3.0|In fairness, there really was no way this movie was going to live up to a book I cherish and have read at least a dozen times. Still, I was more disappointed than I expected. The movie itself was pretty decent, but it was difficult to connect. With so much left out, Charlie's story seemed incomplete and at times, confusing. I had friends asking why this happened and what that meant. I only had the answers because I'd read the book.<br /><br />All that being said, the actors themselves are great. The casting of Logan Lerman as Charlie would have been perfect had the script been better, and his story better told.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|This is an excellent documentary of the history of the Eagles.  I have heard from some that Glenn Frey and Don Henley perhaps seem a bit controlling, i.e., Our Way Or The Highway, but I didn't see it that way.  Bands of the past didn't stay together very long because of personal conflict.  You have to have someone take control and run things.  Don Henley and Glenn Frey put the band together and deserved more $$ than the other members.  They were very meticulous and were not just looking out for themselves.  Don Felder didn't seem to really understand this and wanted the same as they were getting, but that would have been unfair to Don and Glenn, in my opinion.  Don Henley and Genn Frey wrote most of the songs together and deserved more for this.  The Eagles music today is still very popular.  I have seen them in concert 5 times and they are an excellent band and excellent musicians.  If you like the Eagles you will enjoy this documentary time after time, because the music is what it is all about.  The Eagles music will last forever!!  To all of the complainers, I say \\"Get Over It\\".
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Enjoyed the game very much. It had nice graphics and enjoyed fact it was based in Europe. Will like to play again.
B009OXS8RQ|5.0|Lana Del Rey has outdone herself. Her music is so different from current song artists out there. The vinyl gives this wonderful album even more of a vintage feel. You go Lana.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|the final conclusion to the best batman trilogy, all of the other movies had their pluses and minus but this is by far the best version of batman
B000ZLFALS|5.0|This is a Great music movie!! We have given it as gifts and the people who receive them Love it too... We have watched it many times!!
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|The movie was so long it had to be broken into two films, and this was very epic? love live the boy who lived
B000001EYO|4.0|It is definitely a cult classic movie and a great soundtrack needing to be translated to album. Lebowskifest has grown and spread, inviting all of us who love this movie and the music (Not the Eagles, man) and it needs to be able to pop in an inclusive soundtrack. Creedence rules The Big Lebowski movie but is missing from the soundtrack. Also, Viva Las Vegas does not make an appearance. The Big Johnson and Miss Colvin are necessary to accompany the movie. All in all, good music but not enough from the movie. Hotel California version is good as are the Townes Van Zant Dead Flowers, and The Man in Me Bob Dylan.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This is the best show ever made, everybody should add this to their collection. great acting, and great writing and great story.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|I loved all of this movie!  I would recommend this movie without hesitation. Angels are needed everyday in our lives.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed every minute.  Love these books!  Don't expect the books to align exactly with the movies, as there is only so much time in a movie to weave a story for viewers who may or may not be familiar with the books.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Dear customers and review writers,<br /><br />  please remember that this is not a movie fan site so please do not fail to mention the actual product it self.....I really don't care if you liked the movie your self, at all.<br /><br />********BLU-RAY**********COLLECTION*******************Lethal Weapon 5 discs************************************<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************<br />Lethal Weapon Collection 1-4, comes in one large blu-ray box, each movie has its own disc + one bonus disc for a total of 5.<br />Be genital when closing as one part comes over the other, it's a bit hard to explain, you'll see.<br /><br />If you have not seen these movies by now you probably won't enjoy them.

B00136JS12|5.0|It's Boston. Just as expected. I now have a copy that is secure and on the cloud. I will always have it and it won't get scratched.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I work midnight shift so trust me, I've tried just about every white noise app there is. I don't understand some of the other reviews. Yes, you can mix sounds and apps in custom mixes of your own choosing. No, they're not pushy about you leaving a rating. I've used the heck out of this app and this is the first time I've been asked. No, the app doesn't run in the background constantly .... if you want it to stop, hit &quot;pause&quot;. There, much easier than shutting down your device. lol<br />The noise choices are regularly updated, and it appears you can make requests too (haven't tried that because I've been happy with what I've seen thus far.) Just check the download marketplace. The updated downloads are free, btw.<br />This is the only white noise app I use. Thanks for the pleasant experience. :)
B005Y1SVKQ|1.0|There are apps that do far more for much less. Basically just inserts measurements that you ask it to. Other apps let you design and have the measurements automatically inserted.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is well written. I cannot wait to continue this trilogy. I couldn't put this book down. I hope the movie can stand up to this book
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|When I first got this app it actually worked. So once u get it try it out. Maybe u might like it. Hope u enjoy your app. Thanks for reading this also.
0679805273|5.0|I got this for my son so each of his teachers can sign it at the end of the yr. It has been great so far and I hope that it turns out to be a meaningful gift!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Gameloft makes great games but I really wish they stop making an option to download resources or something so I would like to ask gameloft to stop it with that
B0083ZBW2Y|1.0|The book was not bad but if your not interested in books like this do not even bother.  But it was slightly interesting near the end for me.
0446699616|3.0|Half way through the book there is a scene - the main characters have just taken a many hour drive through the desert, during which time they successfully deal with an ambush attempt.  The description of the trip is something like \\"five hours of boredom, interrupted by 2 minutes of terror.\\"  That about describes this book to me.  There is just so much content that does nothing to advance the story, I found myself wanting to skip ahead.  It is not that I dislike character development, dialogue, and description.  But when I find myself zoning out, that is a bad sign.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a good app . It lets u know what out there . Keep u out of danger. It very good . I LOVE IT!!!
B007IX383I|4.0|Good cd, It's different from their older albums but great concert last night in  at the Gramercy theater in NYC
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game because you can use different colorful blades and backgrounds I almost play game every day  !
1476715904|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was able to read it in one sitting and didn't skip a word of it. When I'm bored with a book, I find myself skipping paragraphs. With this book, I was glued to it for the couple hours it took me to read it!
B002RVZV9U|5.0|The rythm of the film is extraordinary, but the real merit it's in the way the director put together all the elements around a simple concept: electric guitar. May be you aren't real fanatic of this guys but, if you love rock and guitars, you have to watch this movie!
1476719071|5.0|Since reading Beautiful Disaster, I've been unable to find a book that compares to it. I enjoyed it so much that I read it twice (which I never do)!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love everything about this book and the whole series. I finished all five books in less than one week!
B005K17RU0|1.0|I loved this app then it forced me to update.  Now it is almost unreadable.  Before the graphics were large attractive easy to read and manipulate. Now they are small and fine so they are hard to see especially for someone. with bad vision.  Please I would pay to get the old version back.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Watched it dozen of times,  still enjoy it.  Would very much like to see John carter 2,3, 4..... Etc. great story and Disney did a great job producing it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It's nice to read a current book by an author who has read a lot of the same books as I.ACIM, Gary Renard, Dr Bruce Lipton, Charles Fillmore, etc. the experiments actually worked, sometimes a day late but nevertheless worked.

B00127RAJY|5.0|On day 6. It gets easier and easier. After the three days you will be sore really bad. But keep pushing yourself. The soreness goes away on the 4th day, promise.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Like the old favourite but updated and a game like this is absolutely made for the touch screen having a blast!
B00D8H3Q2G|5.0|perfect 10!  i loved the movie and always loved the soundtrack!  now i get to listen to the fully restored, remastered to the hi-resolution  qualities of SACD.  i love the way they mix in movie spoken dialouge with each audio track, wonderfully done!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|i installed mine with no problems using the included power connection as my older tv did not have all the needed ports.<br />watched a movie on you tube. after shutting the tv and wifi i noticed that the dongle was flashing a small light and when i touched it it was extremely hot. so i unplugged it from the power source.<br />is this \\"normal\\"?
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Have only begun to play but am really enjoying it. Am a novice so making a meal of it at times but is keeping my interest. Better than most of the few I've tried and best of all the graphics are clear which is paramount when using a kindle fire.
1569242739|5.0|I have made cupcakes from here a dozen times, and fed them to grateful omnis who were none the wiser, unless they knew I brought them. Vanilla with vanilla buttercream and red velvet with cream cheese frosting are my go-tos for parties, and everyone loves them. Isa and Terry make baking easy and fun!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Made my imagination soar to new and interesting places. Just when you think you have it hard...a new perspective to examine.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love all of the Reacher novels. Lee Child constructs intricate plots and creates great characters. Each book is better than the one before it.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Good action-filled story that's not a rehash of the original Stallone one ... different storyline and villains. It does contain some gruesome bits but I think they were not excessive.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful surprise.  This is the first series I have read from this author.  It was a very gripping story.  The stories in the wool series are not just for science fiction fans, but for those that find human nature an interesting subject.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I HAVE BEEN HAVING MY KINDLE FIRE SINCE MAY AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. MY GRANDSON AND HIS WIFE CAME VISIT ME TODAY AND HE GOT IT STARTED FOR ME AT LAST. THANK U SO MUCH. I LOVE MY TABLET.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|i have always loved josh groban. while this album lacks the classical flair of the first two, i still love it. i would say i wasn't especially attached to it when i first listened. but after viewing the video of his singing in the penthouse, it was nice to listen to.
B00CTT9646|4.0|I am just going to make comment about a couple of specific things regarding the Star Trek Into Darkness Starfleet Phaser Limited Edition Gift Set (Blu-ray 3D Combo Pack).<br /><br />One is the quality of the phaser replica varies a lot between units. Many people have returned it a couple of times to get a good one. There is warping and chipping reported. Mine was OK though not perfect but I won't be returning it to the US.<br /><br />The second is the UV (Ultraviolet) Digital copy that supposedly comes with this release. This is not redeemable outside of the US. This is a rip-off and was not mentioned anywhere in the advertising for this product. They wonder why people download pirate copies.
0061124958|5.0|I gave it to my niece in China, who still cannot read in English. But she was instantly attracted to its beautiful illustrations. She asked me to read and explain the story to her and she made her mother promise to finish it when I left after a week. It's such a classical tale and it is very moving.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel! Initially, I found it difficult to keep up with the various characters, but it wasn't long before  I was hooked by each of their personal dramas. The character development is very well done, and the story line is mind blowing! Great novel.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased this device primarily to stream live video and YouTube videos using my Cisco Linksys E3200 wifi router and Samsung 46&#34; High Definition TV. I am very pleased with my abilities to stream a 2-hour weekly live video of a church service that broadcasts each Sunday morning via a LiveStream channel. I first tried using the Chrome browser on my Windows 7 HP laptop and after about an hour the quality began to degrade. But when I used the Chrome browser on my Windows 7 HP desktop I had no problems at all with the HD live stream. For that reason, I give this device five stars. My rating is because the device does a great job doing what I need it to do. Also the folks at Google chromecast were great when I had technical questions about the initial set-up with my router.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Everything about Orphan Black is stellar from the writing acting to the story. I watched it live on tv and loved it so much that I bought the bluray.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I was looking forward to playing Candy Crush on my Kindle. Very disappointed to discover this cheap app instead. Will be deleting it immediately.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|My kids are four, two and one years old.  They absolutely love this movie.  The animation is still the same crisp, beautiful animation from the TV show.  There are several new songs which my kids ask me to play over and over.  And I'm happy to play them, as I like the music, too.  Twilight's transition from pony to human had me worried, and at first I &#34;poo poo'd&#34; the movie.  But it is done beautifully.<br /><br />One small disappointment, they added a slightly romantic aspect between the character Twilight Sparkle and a boy named Flash.  Since she is transported to a &#34;human&#34; world and is in high school, I guess they couldn't leave this kind of interaction out.  But it makes the movie geared a little more toward girls a little older (ie. 8-11 years), and at the end, the romantic aspect follows her to her pony world with a new pony named Flash.  It's left completely open ended, and I assume the next season will also contain this aspect.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a book that will keep you on your toes from the very first page. You will try to rush to get to the end and then you'll get upset when the story does end. Liane Moriarty writes in a way that easily captivates you. The storyline is unique and believable. I can't wait to read her other books as well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful book!  Loved every minute!!!  I could barely put it down!  Must have more, please ;)<br /><br />The characters, the story development, everything; it was lovely.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Great well build product. Its a little tight at first to get the flashlight in (expected) but after a few days its fits just right.<br />Also great seller its came way before i expected it to.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is not the kind of book I usually read, but I had read so much about it and the author (who is Mel Brooks' son), that I decided to go outside my comfort zone. I'm very glad I did. This is a well written, engaging story that held my interest. My only criticism is the footnotes: if they had to be used, they should have been on the bottom of the page, not at the end of the book. Unless there's some trick I don't know about, it's just about impossible to refer to them on an e reader.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|im dont usully like reading books but this when i reed the first chapter of this book i love it !!! i just love it !!!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I did not expect too much from this movie so I chose not to see it in the theaters.  I now think that might have been a mistake.  It was the best Dredd movie by far and would like to see them do more with this franchise.  I doubt they will because it seems many people were like me and did not give it a chance.  I hope that more will view it now that it is on blue ray so that it will have a chance to have a sequel.
0393327345|4.0|To he honest, I enjoyed the movie better. Though, as always, the book contains more information than the movie version. Yet, in this case, the timeline in the movie was well defined. This could be because I saw the movie before reading the book, but the book's timeline through me off. It is not complicated, but I suppose I got stuck on to the movie.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|great Condition
B002ZG976U|5.0|Love the movie but once it starts getting to the end of the movie it stops then we have to go to scenes details and start back from there tried this in two different dvd players and still does it. The movie is great if it would play all the way through.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm completely obsessed! I don't want to do anything but play this game! I'm turning into a complete home body haha. But in all seriousness... best. Game. Ever. If you don't download this then you are missing out in more ways than one.. #obsessed
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I gave this book a four star rating because it was a good book but at times it was a little boring.
B007NVJ7NU|1.0|Easily the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. Those people that claim this movie is mind bending or beautiful need to have their heads examined. While there was some neon lights, a lot of skin, and a consistently out of focus camera, I would hardly call it beautiful. The mind bending part about reincarnation was ridiculous in that it is mentioned, and then a camera floats around for 2.5 hours. The acting was also absolutely horrible.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Lady Gaga is back, everyone.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie, I thought Born This Way was a big disappointment after The Fame and The Fame Monster. Sure, a couple from Born This Way were good, but it was nothing in comparison.<br /><br />However, Applause gives me a lot of hope for Artpop. The beginning is kind of weird, yeah, but the chorus is definitely good ol' catchy Lady Gaga.<br /><br />Sure, it's kind of like Ellie Goulding's Lights in the sense that I have absolutely no idea what the words are, but I do really like this song. It'll be stuck in your head for ages.<br /><br />The down side? You have no idea what to sing because all I know is that she apparently lives for the applause.<br /><br />So when does Artpop come out?
B00DI75SWM|3.0|It's very fun to create keep calm pics but you can't save them to your kindle and the generator doesn't save it either. I kinda wish I could have used my$.99 on something else.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ps the game is awesome you should get the pc is the best<br />Player nastynat03<br /><br />True the best<br />Tip #100 don't go in the dark<br />Because you will die
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I can not wait for the next book to be available through Barnes and Noble!  Morgan Rice has held my attention with every book I have read. The story line is very interesting and it does not focus on just one person all the time which I love.  It tell a story of all of their lives.  The main characters I felt were a little  young for what they are going through but back in that time age was not an issue.  This book is for the young and old (lol) as I am over 50. Was a wonderful read. Thank you and keep writing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is for minion lover's. if you love despicable me movies then this game is for you.I give it a 5
B00F35BV64|4.0|not as good as the first one but still not bad.  I think they rushed the plotline too much to make it great
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I love the way  this book goes from one story to the next yet ties the characters and the plot all together.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The Lost Hero is an action packed book just like all Rick Riordan's books.  I can't wait until I read the Son of Neptune then the Mark of Athena.  The Lost Hero is definitely one of the best books I've read.  All praise the gods of Rome and Greece.  Demigods unite.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|All in all I liked Fall of Giants but Winter of the World was terrific. Lots of coincidences in characters meeting at important times.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|\\"The Lorax\\" is a film that, in my opinion, teaches us one valuable lesson. I think we should all try to take better care of our planet, and this film helps us understand why. The characters are charming, the story is well-developed, and the whole movie experience is fascinating. I recommend it.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I thought i wasn't going to like this movie but my girlfriend convinced me to watch it with her since she heard it was good.  After giving in i must say it was better than i thought.
B00BT8Y774|5.0|I find that \\"Rise of the Guardians\\" is a film for everyone to enjoy, including adults. It tells the story of how the Bogeyman creates a chaos by turning children's pleasant dreams into nightmares and by tricking them to stop believing in Santa Claus, the easter bunny, and all of these beloved characters we all know of. As kids continue to stop believing, innocence and magic begin to disappear, weakening the guardians and earning the Bogeyman more strength to continue with his madness. Does he win? Are innocence and magic finally lost? That would be for me to keep and for you to find out. Also, don't forget the popcorn, because the movie experience will be great. Yes, this is my way of saying that the film rules!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. When I took my 7 year old to see it in the movies, he loved it as well. It is full of action and keeps you interested.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Easy to use. It's makes things easier to stay connected on multiple devices. I use it on my Kindle and my iPhone. LOVE IT
B0068ZGQYA|5.0|Ok, after watching the first episode, my roommate and I almost gave up on this series (Like most people it seems after reading the comments).  Too much sex and nothing makes sense.  I guess they were trying to make it the hook episode but it didn't really do that for us.  We just ended up hating most of the characters. After the first episodes, the sex scenes die down and the story and characters come out.  The props are a bit overused (babies in jars, creepy house, ect.) but the story always keeps turning so you have to be on your toes to figure out whats going on.  This show also has a lot of back stories so if you are into that, you will definitely like this show.  Characters that you hate, you are probably eventually going to like or feel sorry for.  We are now on our 6th episode and we can't wait until we have time to watch more.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Truth, compassion, common sense, acceptance, humor, love of country, disdain for evil and stupidity...all make for a remarkably great book!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A good buy....made me laugh and think....loved it.....life definitely seems worthwhile after reading this book....enjoyed every moment spent reading the book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movies and this is an entertaining way to enjoy the story again and again even when we travel!
B0042J6VUS|4.0|it is a little flimsy not going to lie. but all the people who a writing that it feel apart in their hand.my guess would be that you stretched it too hard. you do have to be carefully whcih is why its only getting for stars plus it doesnt hold the phone up very well
B002GMSMHS|5.0|It's hard to find these picture cards anywhere.  So glad you had it!  I set it aside until my present one is full.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I only gave this four stars because it was so short. If G5 is going to charge 4.99 then I expect the game to be longer! That being said I enjoyed the storyline and the mini games. I found the hint button helpful.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|I had first downloaded another app of this game done by a fake company that stole it.  That one had terrible permissions. I never kept it on my device long and have since deleted it from my cloud. This game is the real deal with the Not Doppler developers that made it. I first found this game online and fell in love with it. I don't mind at all paying for the real game. Thanks for releasing it on Amazon.
0743243315|4.0|I must admit that I first bought this book because I was leaving London after living off Brick Lane for a number of years and I was feeling prematurely nostalgic, so my expectations for a connection with the scene might have been a bit high. I really wanted to love this book, but I could never really connect with the main character, a young Bangladeshi girl, Nazneen, married off by her father to an older, silly man who lives in the predominately Bangladeshi East London neighborhood surrounding Brick Lane. The first half presents a somewhat two dimensional woman, and I wish she could have come across more vibrantly, after all, she was only 19 at the time and in a new country, even if she rarely leaves her own apartment. After tragedy strikes time jumps forward to life over a decade later, and we are reintroduced to our protagonist, who has become more complex in the intervening years, and I found myself surprised and excited to realize at one point that as time moves forward, this would be a novel to confront 9/11 and its aftermath for Muslim citizens/residents of a Western country. However, while Ali does a remarkable job of coloring her side characters, in particular the eldest daughter and Nazneen's best friend, Nazneen's inner world remains frustratingly elusive, or worse, flat, leading to an ending that does not feel particularly deserved.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This came in brand new and properly packaged and with neatly labeled locations.  The only part I did not like is the slots for the SATA drives, it is a lot tighter than my older Gigabyte motherboard and I had to experiment in a way to accommodate my various drives.  Has heat protection as a safety measure just in case.
0140067477|5.0|I can't even remember the number of friends I have given copies of this to as a gift, or simply lent out for a quick read. Every single one of them loved it, and some of them continue to reread it all the time, like I do. I first heard about this wonderful book in high school, when I was taking a class on world religions. Now, there are certainly more comprehensive guides to learning about Taoism, but finding one of them seems like something Owl would do, not Pooh, and as Benjamin Hoff teaches, we should all try to act a little more like Winnie-the-Pooh. So every time I need to remember to slow down and let life comes as it will, I reread parts of this book. It's message of living more simply, and not thinking quite as hard or holding on to emotional roadblocks is one that we can all learn from, not to mention that revisiting classic Pooh tales is so much fun, it cures your blues all on its own!
0141345659|5.0|I started reading this together with my niece who is a young adult and could not put it down. Absolutely worth reading.
0060786523|5.0|I absolutely cannot say enough about this book. If first read it about five years ago, and, as I'm sure you will be, I approached it as a little bit of a challenge. As many people have commented, this book is so long its almost hard to hold, but as I got to the last few hundred pages, I kept wishing that there would be more and more and more. I never wanted to stop reading it. I read a lot of novels in a year, but very few have stuck with me the way this one has. Just say the words \\"A Suitable Boy\\" and I am transported back into the lives of the main characters, and I still get emotional over the choice the Lata makes.<br /><br />Many reviewers have also commented about how this is a sprawling family drama, which almost doesn't do justice to the way you, the reader, infiltrate these characters' lives, and that you learn an awful lot about Indian history. That is very true, and in fact, I think I know more about 1950's India, and Indian history in general, from reading this book than I do from a class I took in college on the subject, but A Suitable Boy isn't a history book. Seth doesn't wonder away from the story for a not-so-brief lecture on the history of land rights in India, he weaves these social and political concerns so effortlessly into the backdrop of this story that you're almost surprised in the end by how much you've learned.<br /><br />So if you're on the fence, not really sure if it's too long, or too dense, or if you're not a history or Indian culture buff, stop worrying. This book has something for absolutely everyone, and will make you love each and every one of the characters. From the moment Lata's mother declares she intends to find a husband for her daughter, to the very last page, you will be completely enthralled by this world.
B000HL09MG|3.0|I don't recall having such a hard time with the acting and casting choices in this film. I want to love the film, but I can barely watch it. Most roles are well performed, but I just have a trying time suspending any disbelief with the piss poor acting by Kidman and Cruise. I mean don't get me wrong, as far as they go it's the best of their career, but looking back I shouldn't have purchased this. For the price it might make for a good watch when I'm in the mood for overpaid celebrities s***ting all over the master work of a true auteur. Netflix it.
0156034026|4.0|I admire the confidence and thoughtfulness Hamid brings to such a difficult subject, the treatment and reactions of Muslims living in New York after 9/11, or at least one. He brings sympathy to a position that must seem impossible to the American people, a bit of admiration for a group of people willing to take on American Exceptionalism, while still ultimately loving the country. As other reviewers note, the use of the second person singular is interesting, and I was genuinely interested in the narrator's relationship with his American girlfriend and colleagues, but I can't help but thinking that the voice and story ultimately falls flat, something about the listlessness of the tone, perhaps. Worth the read, but I don't think I'll be looking to revisit it.
B00008S7KC|1.0|As an avid Floyd fan, this DVD was an essential; when the replacement (this purchase) imagine my dismay when I discovered it wouldn't play! This is incompatible with my DVD player! Wish Amazon had a disclaimer on this!!
B008J05EL8|1.0|Won't work. Won't install, won't do anything. AVOID. Want to give zero stars. And there needs to be a better way to 'return' an app.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game to keep you mind young. great to do when bored. tricky and can be confusing but don't give up.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|Great game. I enjoy using this game to take a break from a busy day.  It is very easy to play and keeps you busy.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This was a good book. I just had different expectations for it. I knew what was going to happen before I even finished the book.
B005DESVPO|5.0|This album is what really sold me to buying more of his records.<br />He has this sound that can shut you up and put you in a trance listening to his talent.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I absolutely love the weather channel app. It gives me all the information that I need and its more accurate than other weather app's. :)
B003F9G8B8|1.0|We rented this video, but were never able to watch it.  It showed up as paid for on our digital orders, but there was no way to view it.  I have bought videos on Amazon and that worked fine.  Searched the wed to find solutions, it all seems real simple.  Will never rent a video from Amazon again.  Very frustrating.
B004QYTRRS|4.0|It's quick romantic movie. Just enough action that the boys might be able to sit threw it (added A.J. is in it won't bother them either lol)
B00EQNYOYU|4.0|Not quite back to the excellence of Year Zero, but a great step in the right direction with after the aptly titled The Slip.  Complete with some new and even alien sounds for NIN. A surprising release coming out hot on the trails of the first How to Destroy Angels record.  Let's just hope Reznor keeps up the momentum.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|i waited anxiously for the release of this film.  was very disappointed.  it is nothing like the book.  i will not purchase anything else about hobbits produced by the same people.
B0055D3EFU|4.0|you know something is going to happen.  you don't know when and you don't know what.  its clean horror.  preys on your personal fears alone.  good old fashioned horror film
B004H4XAXO|5.0|Purchased for my husband to read on holiday and he couldnt put it down! ... it was the quietest holiday ever!  :-)
0817439390|5.0|Extremely well written with no assumption of photographic knowledge.The book is written as if Mr Peterson is sitting in your living room talking to you as a friend.<br />Bill Griffith<br />Trans-portraits<br />Sydney Australia
B0008ENICU|5.0|Fast-paced comedy.  What can you can you say about a movie with all these great actresses.  To describe this movie I'd have to steal a line from another movie rife with great actresses,  \\"Fasten your seats belt, it' going to be a bumpy night!!
B00260GLBO|5.0|Bought this for my son, it was his favorite birthday present. It was exactly as described and has held up well to being played with every day for the last 2 weeks.
B000002TLX|5.0|Richard Marx's Greatest Hits is absolutely awesomeness!!! No words to describe it! Well maybe! But no words! I give a five of five stars! And Happy 50th Birthday Richard Marx! Have a wonderful 50th birthday old man! Just kidding! LOL!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. I give it all positive comments except for the fact that there is still another book. Ahhhhhhhh I wish I could just end at this book but then I think to myself what will I read next? I mean there is no greater book than the Hunger Games. I would recommend this book to 12-1000 year-olds. This book is really good for any teen because it has a great romance for the girls and plenty of action and blood for the boys. Once again I love this book.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is great, I have downloaded a lot of apps like this one and I had always felt they weren't doing anything, but it was different with this one! I really like it, and its really easy to use I was really amazed about how easy it was and its fast was done cleaning in less than five minutes, I really like it and I'm really exited about finding something that works .
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It is so cool plays calm music and i don't know what to say I just love it it is a good app
B009CF3MEK|4.0|It had been a long time since I had seen this movie and couldn't really remember what it was about. So I wanted to see it before seeing the new movie. Definitely adult content.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting and so much fun every day I play it! My friends also like this game, we all battle for the high score and the title \\"Best Subway Surfer\\" this game is epic and free, check it out on the Appstore!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love uno. Uno is a great family game. I have played . Uno since I was five I think. I hope other people like it like meeeeee.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|i think this was a poor adaptation of a great book.  i also think the choices for characters was poorly done.  the actor portraying ben is such a douche, however the choice for chon worked out well.  you could not find a less sexy or more poorly chosen actress for O than blake lively.  she is far too wholesome to pull off that role.  travolta is always lame though so no surprise there.  del toro and hayek delivered outstanding performances as usual.
1250012570|5.0|I loved Eleanor and Park. I really just got lost in this novel. It really was a true love. I loved Park he was just adorable. I loved Eleanor too. I felt so bad for her. I really felt for the characters as if they were real people, not characters.
0205313426|5.0|The book is very concise and yet has all the writing rules needed. It is like taking a writing class.
1451696191|4.0|Not my favorite. I had high hopes coming into this book. I was a little disappointing. It was still a good book, I just didnt love it.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|A great story.when is the next one coming out. Can't wait to read it. Lots of suspense and intrigue throughout
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game, it is so much fun to play. I am such a big fan of the movies and the game is great.
0525423842|5.0|My son loved it & passed his AR test w/ 100%:)  John Grisham is one of my favorites & I guess one of his too!!!
B0019N95IK|3.0|I like the series of Enterprise so I thought I would give the Blu-Ray version a try.  I already have all four seasons on DVD and wanted to see how it looked in High Definition.  Immediately when opening the case I noticed the disks were loose inside the case. They basically put an entire season of 6 disks into a one disk case.  All the disks visually looked fine though.  I was also unable to put the disk back into the case without them falling out while trying to close it.  Poor design and cheep construction.<br /><br />Two episodes on disk four did not work.  The disk was free from scratches or any sort of visual damage.  I can only guess it is a manufacturing problem but I guess it's possible it was damaged during shipping.<br /><br />I think I will stick with the DVD version of the series for now.  The Blu-Ray version wasn't a whole lot better quality and isn't worth the sloppy packaging job and disks that don't play for the higher price tag.  I'm sure since this is there first run at HD there is due to be some hiccups and they will iron out the bugs down the road.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Well this app is extremely difficult at times only because it say you can wake up to your fav music but I have no idea how
B003VIWO9I|5.0|This is a bit different from what we may think of as Terry's &#34;normal&#34; tales. Oh the humor is there, and the sly cleverness, but this is a tale both darker and perhaps more thoughtful than one might expect. One of his best!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game love it on it everyday so addicted to it. advise anyone to purchase this game. Full stars for this game.

B00DQBWLSO|5.0|LOVE this album. I am a huge John Mayer fan and have been since before Room for Squares was released. His last two albums have been my least favorite, and Continuum and Room For Squares have always been my favorites--until now. Paradise Valley shows a ton of lyrical and emotional growth for JM as an artist. Waiting on the Day, On the Way Home, Dear Marie and Who You Love are my favorite tracks. I am listening to this one over and over.
B002ZG97EC|1.0|I ordered the Despicable Me (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy) - when it arrived the digital copy was not included. I called Amazon and they gave me a digital copy via Amazon player - but was told that I could download to my computer and add to my apple devices. They also sent me another replacement order and that arrived without the digital copy as well. I returned that order since they said I would be charged. The file that I was able to download to my PC is a WMV which is not supported by itunes and I cannot add to my sons ipod touch or my iphone. If they would have shipped me the actual movie and digital copy I would have been able to add that to my itunes. Do NOT order unless you don't care about the digital copy.

B006CR2PD0|2.0|If your 'suspension of disbelief' can swallow this storyline, you can handle anything. Jurasic Park is a completely acceptable reality as compared to a woman like Basinger's character putting up with this kind of 'come on' from any male, no matter what they look like.  The only movie I can think of with this much potential sex appeal which completely flopped to this degree on a cinematic level would be Bo Derick in Tarzan.  Surely Playboy has a spread sheet on Basinger that they can recommend as an alternative to spending valuable time watching this movie.
B001EIOOWC|1.0|The worst movie I saw this year. The script is poor. No interesting characters at all. Absurd scenes like Nikolai and Anna know where Kyril is going to kill the baby and go to the right place and in the right moment. Wounded Nikolai does not have any other place but to crawl over the dead killer, and the dead killer resurrects and tries to finish his job by removing a knife from his own body.  The best absurd of the century!

B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|J.J. Abrams (the director of the film) does a good job of introducing to new or non Trekkers or Trekkies a key character/nemesis from the original series. To me it looks like he's trying to blend or include the two fan groups (1960's-90's and the new movies) with this introduction. The story had way more action than character developement but I guess that is due to the status quo these days in film making. Roddenberry was WAAAAAAAAAY into character developement. Just look at TNG, Voyager or DS9 to see my point. In those series he cared much more about us &#34;knowing&#34; the characters than actual story lines although the creative genius of the plots was never lacking. Gene was also resolute about the prime directive which both versions of Kirk ignore (esp the new version). Picard would rather die than &#34;bend&#34; it. The latter part of the movie was interesting in the &#34;twist&#34; of characters between Spock and Kirk. Not so sure he had to go that far to hold the older Trek fans but I was waiting for &#34;the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.&#34; All in all a good movie which BTW do not rest with my older Star Trek movies. The new ones are just that &#34;new&#34;. Both versions of Star Trek reflect the generation they were/are directed toward with enough &#34;old&#34; version links to keep us older fans interested.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It flowed just as well as his other novels with just as much emotion and allure.  I couldn't put it down.
B00DMEQP46|4.0|I have read many negative reviews for MGMT's latest self-titled album, the truth of the reviewer's criticism is undeniable and obvious upon the first couple listens. Personally, I feel there is more to this album than what has been said. I have to be honest, I'm not sure what it is, but what I am certain about is after listening to it for most of today, I now have an understanding of the direction that Andrew and Benjamin want their music to go to.<br /><br />Like Congratulations, MGMT steers far away from the style of music that brought them into the airwaves. For some, this is very disappointing move, for me, it has grabbed my attention and eagerness to see what comes next. It's pretty clear that MGMT are not interested in making hit songs or continuing the formula that got them success in the first place. The question I ask is this really a bad thing? Is going in a different direction really so heartbreaking? For a casual listener of music or this band, sure, it's understandable. But isn't it a band's mission to grow and create? Maybe MGMT have abused this freedom on their 3rd record, or maybe they are distancing themselves away from the spotlight as far as possible. Whatever the reason, they seem to be set on the music they want to make.<br /><br />MGMT is an album that goes in many different directions. From synth/sound effects filled songs, to organic studio jams, it's hard to pin point what style this album is exactly; it's more of an album to listen to from start to finish. The songs that stood out the most for me are:<br /><br />\\"Alien Days\\"<br />\\"Cool Song No. 2\\"<br />\\"Introspection\\" (My fav.)<br />\\"I, Love You Too, Death\\"<br /><br />This album would be a great addition to anyone's vinyl collection; it provides that perfect atmospheric sound that could fill up a room with that necessary background noise. MGMT is simply an album to listen to and enjoy, if your expectations are high, you are either going to be content or really disappointed: there's not muchspace in the middle. Doesn't seem to be a whole lot of elements to analyze or ponder. MGMT seem to feel confident to make the kind of music that they want to make and on their own terms. I can't compare the music to anything in particular, if I had to, I would say if you threw the experimentation of Brian Eno and the recent style of The Flaming Lips, you would get this album. Love it or hate it, time will tell what will come with these guys. Maybe it's not the album we expected, but it is something that should be given a chance.

B00D5LC4GY|2.0|Well, it's a decent puzzle game, but the haphazard snapping forces extra unnecessary moves. Even when the shadow lines up the way you want it, it doesn't snap in place properly at least half the time. Unfortunately, that takes a potentially cute little puzzle game and turns it into a frustrating mess.

B00E34A9FU|5.0|judging by the many enthusiastic and well written reviews of sunshine daydream a newcomer to the dead would think this is a great concert ;; well that would be correct ! over at the dead web site it is reported this show has been the most requested show ever. a show that's circulated as a bootleg for years, has finally been \\"officially\\" released now that legal issues have all been resolved. and a great release it is. the annoying echo in the vocals on my bootleg copy have been eliminated on this new version and the latest remix technology has been used to bring the sound up to the highest standards. but what really stands out is the wonderful clarity on the dvd ::: a huge upgrade from the old vhs tape that has circulated for many years. and the best part is turning up my surround sound on the home entertainment system ,,, WOW does it sound GREAT !!! being able to see the show is also a huge bonus since that experience really brings back memories of \\"being\\" in 1972 and remembering everything that was going down back then. plus seeing jerry and the band playing one of the best dark stars, is truly amazing ! if you are wondering if it is worth the $$ to pick this new version up i can tell you the answer is a loud and happy \\"yes\\" !! enjoy the show !

1781162646|5.0|I'm marking up Stephen King's Joyland like some people do the Bible. Highlighting, underlining and making comments in the margins, boy, will some of my Christian friends have issues with me. Worse yet, instead of doing my work--which today should have been the writing of my own book--I'm sitting with a cup of coffee reading King's latest novel.<br /><br />I must confess, I have not been a fan of King's work. The horror genre is not my thing. But, good writing is. And without a doubt, Stephen King is a master story teller and superb writer. Like an eager apprentice studying a master painter, I am soaking up literary skills I can only wish were mine. As a writer of young adult literature, how can I not be fascinated with the brilliant way King brings a young man's emotions and pain onto the pages of a novel that is both a little creepy and a tender coming of age story?<br /><br />Joyland is, at its heart, the coming of age tale of 21 year old Devin Jones. Devin is an ordinary kid, a nice guy. But of course, he's chasing after the wrong girl. How many young men don't do exactly the same thing? Devin is going through a rough breakup with the-girl-who-is-so-not-right-for-him. While battling what King calls \\"suicidal ideations\\" after the gut-wrenching breakup, Devin gets a job at Joyland, a second rate amusement park filled with college kids at summer jobs and colorful \\"carnies\\" that are kind of there for life. He's a young man on an emotional roller coast. The ghost, throat-slashing serial killer, and who-dun-it-murder mystery serve only as plot devices to help young Devin finally grow up.<br />The ghost and serial killer might sound scary, but there aren't really very many scary moments in Joyland. There are a few, but there are many more touching moments. As one reviewer said, \\"Moments where you want to reach out to Devin and say, `Devin, hang in there dude - we'll get through this together and things will work out great.'\\" This isn't a book that will keep you up at night; this is a book that will keep you wondering how Stephen King can put into words so perfectly what it's like to be a 21-one year old virgin who wants to do \\"it\\" with a girl he thinks he's in love with, but who has already moved on to do \\"it\\" with someone else. If you're looking for a Stephen King tale of terror, then look elsewhere. There are few bloody romps into the grotesque. But there is a story that most young people can probably relate to. That is the brilliance of Stephen King.ght; this is a book that will keep you wondering how Stephen King can put into words so perfectly what it's like to be a 21-one year old virgin who wants to do \\"it\\" with a girl he thinks he's in love with, but who has already moved on to do \\"it\\" with someone else.

B009LGO88E|4.0|It's really convenient to have a second circle pad and extra shoulder buttons, there is only two problems; The first is that there is a serious lack of games that utilized the circle pad pro, but more importantly is that its just not comfortable. It sticks out to the right side so it throws off the balance and there may be a grip on the bottom but it still makes you hold it in an awkward way which isn't too bad unless you play it for and extended amount of time then it will get uncomfortable. But overall I think it's nice, if you have a game like Metal Gear Solid then it might be worth looking into, because it can make it much more smooth. You just may have to get used to aiming because the sensitivity is different than an actual joystick.

0634049011|5.0|New learner on guitar.  Can read music (played mostly woodwinds)but never played a stringed instrument. Fretboards or necks without frets have always been a mystery.  Enter this amazing book!  AMAZING!<br /><br />Chapter 2 on \\"Root Shapes\\" is alone worth the price of the book.  After less than hour I can just put my hand/fingers on ANY note!  Gimme a \\"G\\"  Okay... here let me play six of 'em in different locations.  Suddenly the fretboard is a lovely map of territory to begin to explore, and not a forbidding landscape.<br /><br />Rush, RUSH to order this book.  It will help you understand the physical layout of the instrument and will surely reduce your learning time no matter what method you are using to learn.

B00C2FFJFM|1.0|i have heard her voice and those songs and she truly makes me miss the days when Jennifer Lopez ran the airwaves and though J Lo was just a Ok singer at best, at least something was bit catchy, on this album it just hurts at the hype and the way the material is truly weak and nothing here is memorable. all the autotone can't cover up a weak vocal presentation and those songs are  yikes! however to her credit she is a alll across the board act who has the money on her and the right handlers to make her  hit in film and tv, so the music game is a hobby.

B00CL8D83U|2.0|finally got to here this album and while i have dug them back in the day, this album felt like one  ep with no consistancy or any groove or melody. the  songs  start to build up and then fade before they even get something off and running. i felt this  record was trying to be slick and it never found an idenity and it never  found its mark.
159562015X|5.0|So often we are trying to work out weaknesses instead of truly being grateful for our strengths. Yes, it is good to work to turn about our weaknesses but this book helps one work more productively from the area of our individual strengths.  I highly recommend it and taking the test may be an eye opener!
1451626096|5.0|Phillippa Gregory is a wonderful writer. The White Princess follows much of the other books in this series but she is such a vibrant writer that it is hard to tire of the style or the plots. You don't want to miss a word and she is a master at balancing conversations with descriptions. If you are a reader of the other books in this series (or curious as to what makes her such a popular author) make sure to read this one.

B005LAIIKI|4.0|Django Unchained (the 'D' is silent), is a fun action film. THe film is a bit slowly paced, yet made sure to ensure that the film was still engaging and kept the action moving. I felt it was a bit long winded (2 hours 45 minutes) for my taste, and I felt it could have been sped up a bit without losing anything. The overall plot is simple, Django get's separated from his wife, and this is the story of him trying to rescue her (that's all I can say without ruining anything). While the film focuses heavily on the main characters, Tarentino does a fantastic job of making the story interesting by using secondary characters to his advantage. This adds a lot to the film and makes the film come to life. The movie though isn't as violence focused as some others by him such as Kill Bill (don't worry, there is still plenty of violence), but really takes advantage of humor to make this a bit more light hearted at times. It's important to remember though that this is a fictional movie. There are historical inaccuracies, etc. and this is fine as long as you can look past that.<br /><br />Parents, this is not for kids. There is a little nudity, some innuendos, lots of violence, blood, and gore, use of the \\"N\\" word, concepts such as slavery, alcohol consumption etc. For this reason I'd peg it at 15-18 years old. This obviously will vary depending on the family.<br /><br />Overall, the audio itself is not the best I've heard with it's DTS HD-MA 5.1 soundtrack. The film's vocals are slightly low on the volume end. The dynamics aren't there and it's a bit of a flat soundtrack. The highs and lows don't occur often. It does have a few dynamic peaks, the surrounds are used pretty well to create a nice, encompassing environment.<br /><br />The video was good, a bit cold considering the desert and warm environments the characters were in. The blood and shadows were detailed and the shadows had a fantastic detail level with the grime and textures. The film is a bit soft, not as sharp as I would have liked at times but still well detailed. I believe this is an artistic choice, but one that bothered me at times.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend it, but it was a bit longer than I would have liked. The characters were well developed and had some good humor at times. If you have the time, go for it, but if you can't stand a long and often violent movie, I would recommend passing on this.ould have liked at times but still well detailed.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|If you like action movies and gun play with a mix of interesting actors this is for you. Do not expect amazing performances but you will get some passable ones and a few chuckles from the funny parts. I liked it for the fact that John Malkovich is in it and he makes it worthwhile with his eclectic style. I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars if I could but oh well will push it to 4 but worth a watch I would say.

B00E0G5U4G|5.0|I don't think much needs to be said about this album except that it is brilliant and perfectly executed. If you have been longing for a record that is somewhere in between Necroticism and Heartwork then this is the one to listen to. I was a bit skeptical when I heard Michael Amott wouldn't be a part of it. After hearing I can say that I don't even notice that he isn't on this record. Go and get it now and get this album to the top of the charts to show those over hyped rap and pop artists that real music still can be heard without the help of MTV or radio play. Time to bring metal back to the people.
0985557834|5.0|It is better then volume 1.  Cheaper and has more difficult patterns the &#34;1&#34;.  If you already familiar with paracords, I would buy volume 2 and buy other for beginning books.  You can aslo get many beginning patterns just google it.

0345803485|5.0|I was encouraged by my co-workers to read the Fifty series when it was discovered that I was the only human on the planet who apparently did not get sucked into the fifty vortex. Fifty readers on TV are/were creepy and it turned me off.  but i decided to go down the rabbit hole and I learned some things:<br />1.  if you love Twilight and over 21 this is your book.  Its Bella and Edward without that whole inconvenient vampire thing and if they could actually have sex.  No for real. . it is Twilight. . every character. . .most of the scenes.  It even takes place in Seattle for pete's sake.  What is the pull with the Olympic Peninsula?  Bella=Anastasia; Edward=Christian; Rosalie=Kathleen (even though Kathleen is Anastasia best friend, its still Rosalie)  Emmett=Eliot; Charlie=Ray; Grace +Carrick=Carlise+Esme.  Alice=Mia<br />2. for the people who claim it not good writing. . .well. . its not Shakespeare. . but that is not why you buy Fifty Shades.<br />3. It is thoroughly entertaining, even when the character are vertical. . . well. . being vertical doesn't stop them either.<br />4. you will gain a new appreciation for elevators. Even though you can't tell me that in a million dollar high rise they don't have cameras in the elevators. . but I will let that one go E. L. James. . . this time.<br />5. Its Jane Eyre folks. Not the good literature part, but the dark mysterious Mr. Rochester as a twenty-eight year old CEO meglo-maniac who make his own rules to deal with the hand he is dealt and instead of having a schizophrenic wife in the attic, his dark and mysterious secret is in his heart.  He even has a housekeeper!<br />6.  A sex fiend that does not like to be touched.  (!!!!!).  That's worth the price of admission. By book two you are going to be on the floor, in a fetal position, gasping for air wondering how on earth can one touch have you reeling.  And you will like it.<br />7. Three words.  You. Are. Mine.  (cue the change of panties)<br />8.  And the sex scenes are not that bad either.  If you are into that sort of thing.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Catty Noir is beyond beautiful in person.  My children have been asking for her for a while and I was not amused with the pictures prior to buying her.  She is all black with striking silver accents for makeup adorned with hot pink.  Her dress is extremely beautiful and intricate.  It does have tulle, so I am wondering how long it will hold up, but I will update my review if anything happens.  The most popular negative review states she is made of cheap plastic different from the other monster dolls.....She is the same as all the other monster high dolls and yes her boots do come off and she does have feet.  Her stand is different then all the other dolls with an open circle that is vertical.  I am not sure if she should sit on it or exactly how it works but it fits in between her legs well making her seem fairly sturdy.  Currently we have her sitting on it so the dress can hang down freely.  I think I like the new stand a lot better then the previous ones.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Definitely the best looking monster high doll out.<br />Her dress is absolutely stunning in person<br />Make up and accessories are beautiful<br />Comes with a long book to read<br />Comes with a stand (different then previous ones)microphone 4 bracelets, necklace, and 3 earrings one being a 13.<br />The boots separate in the middle like old barbie boots<br />I bought two (one for a friend and one for me) both seemed to be free of defects<br />I love her right hand and the curve to it<br /><br />Cons:<br />I doubt the dress will last a long time under a child's care<br />The boots may break if a child takes them on and off

Like many of Gladwell's books this book looks at many different variations of this topic, to include the ideal computer programmer and hockey player, all the way down to why other cultures are better at certain skills such as math than those of us in the U.S.<br /><br />Gladwell does very well in this book, as in his other works, to bring the reader to a place of open examination of his/her own situation and the opportunities in their life that have gotten them where they are.  It forces you to look at the unseen opportunities that are possibly commonplace within your culture but often are setting you up for future success in ways you may never know.<br /><br />Another great read from Gladwell!
0062255657|1.0|This book was hard to keep reading. I'm not the kind of person to stop reading a book in the middle, but I wish I had with this. I'm sorry, I'm sure many people like it, but I don't know where the author came up with this idea. I'm glad it was short so I didn't waste too much of my time, but I did waste money on buying it. I had heard it was really good. The summary doesn't say anything about weird imagination land. I thought it would be interesting. I recommend you don't waste your money unless you are familiar with this author and already know you like his style.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This app is easy and fun.  It basically uses compound words that you have to put together.  Sometimes you have to think outside the box though but ultimately it's a very nice game.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Why couldn't he make this into a full story? This was and is one of my favorite short stories ever!
B0014JLYPQ|1.0|Honestly ... I thought the price was to good to be true. It was ! I had it for 2 weeks and the slip resistant track on the bottom of the shoe started to come off. To late to return them now. I should of just gone to store and spend the $40 at the store ..
B007R41E8O|5.0|I became very addicted quickly. I love hidden object games mixed with adventure and puzzles. Great graphics...story keeps me wanting to find more clues to see what is<br /><br />happening on this island. Would recommend it!
B005IQZB14|4.0|A story worth telling and worth reading. Compelling from page 1 to the very end, every young (and young at heart) woman should read this and relish in Strayed`s  wisdom and character. It might just inspire you to head out on your own \\"Wild\\" adventure.
1400032717|4.0|I received the book in a timely manner.  There were some markings in the book, but that was in the description when I purchased it.  Overall good condition.  Nothing to complain about!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The language was beautiful.  This could have been three different novels.  Too many names to remember.  What I enjoyed most was the beautiful detailed writing.  Hosseini is a gifted writer.<br />Marilyn Brown
B008CRC506|5.0|Purchase this for my partner and he was very happy with it. Although the show itself wasn't a hit it is still great for ideas and to watch when you want to kill time
0525478817|5.0|TFIOS was an amazing book. It was the book that got me to love reading again. I highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I totally love this game ..... farts....... it is so cool. I think this game is challenging but........ butt........ really awesome.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I really enjoyed the series and all the Star Trek movies so I was expecting this movie to be better but it fell short.
0525478817|5.0|The book came in excellent condition with no page folds or anything to that matter. I recommend this to anyone.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|don't know what to do with this does not work like cpu you tube<br />don't know what to do with this
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|From #1 til #8 Still loving the game<br />Can't wait for#9 to come out. My Son<br />Turn me on to the game's.
0792841344|3.0|Once again another good product. my ol'man is crazy about this moviewe searched high and low for it. and Amazon had it for a $1.73. the item is like new. and plays great. thank you once again. Once again 5 stars
B003JHKORK|2.0|This movie leaves out a main character  that was in the book and changes the hair color of another one. I think that they did a little bit of a poor job with the Poseidon cabin.They also did not show Percy getting claimed (i thought it would be cool to see). In capture the flag Percy was against Annabeths team in the book she was on Percy`s team. Other than that great action.
0525478817|4.0|My roommate's daughter had to read this for school glad I took it from her. I read it in two days at work. I would recommend this book to adults as well as teens. This book made me realize that we may want to read what are children are reading to make sure you are comfortable with the material and things we are teaching our children.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down...going to buy book 2 and 3 today . Save yourself the time and get the trilogy !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its great I can. stop playing this game it is so addicted I feel like a little child when am playing it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good for free. what do you want me to say? I sit at home and it keeps my time occupied. mission complete.
0670026557|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1RXAL5T032ACS]]I'm a firm believer than your network is your net worth, and have read many books on this topic. Having that said, I was already aware of many principles in the book, however the power of \\"dormant ties\\" was a game changer for me. I've recently started re-kindling past relationships, and it's been amazing! This principle alone, makes the book worth it's weight in gold.
0307476073|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"accompanying\\" the author (without the physical exertion and pain).  Much like a Bill Bryson book but more introspective and less humorous.  Great descriptions of terrain, brutally honest thoughts/feelings and soul searching.  I find myself hoping that the author goes on more journeys and writes about them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. Super fun and easy to play even for my son's! Updates make game even better.  The battle with vector and Delmocho are challenging but not impossible to beat.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Pretty unique movie overall.  A lot of classic Tarantino, including gory violence, but the violence fits in this movie, given the wrenching slavery theme.  This is one of those movies that, despite being long, kept me alert and awake the whole time, often on the edge of my seat wondering what would come next.  The acting was also outstanding across the board.  This one gets a full five stars.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Good clock, nice display. Could use an option for multiple time zones. Can't complain though, it is free. I like it.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|CINDER is a fun, fast-paced re-telling of the Cinderella story with science fiction and paranormal overtones. Set in a far distant future, Cinder is the cyborg ward of a New Bejing widow who has two fully human daughters of her own. Cinder works as a mechanic in the market to support the family, and while she's not covered in ashes, she is covered in grease and soot.<br /><br />The course of Cinder's life changes when Prince Kai, the Imperial heir, visits her booth seeking repairs for his personal android. A spark (no pun intended) flies between them, but Cinder thinks nothing of it. Especially as the market is shut down when a new case of the horrible, deadly plague affecting humanity breaks out.<br /><br />But before too long, Cinder is forced into the Prince's orbit. Not only does she still have Kai's android to repair, but she might hold a key to defeating the plague - or even be the key to defeating the threat posed by the Lunars, descendants of a Moon-based human colony who have learned how to manipulate bio electrical energy and control the thoughts of Earth-born humans.<br /><br />A lot of the fun of the story is seeing how Meyer translates the original Cinderella story. There's an ancient orange VW Bug instead of a pumpkin. Cinder's cybernetic foot stands in for the glass slipper. Her fairy godmother is a doctor who excels at telling half-truths. There's a betrothal ball, but not the way you think.<br /><br />At the same time, Meyer's story is original and not all dependent on Cinderella. The world-building is nicely done. Nor does Meyer pull her emotional punches. Cinder's life is gritty, and her world has consequences not often seen in the Disney versions of the original material.<br /><br />I'm very much looking forward to the next books in the series.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Sure, if you are old enough, you can think of Total Recall, a bit of the Matrix and even see some of The Sphere.  Heck pick a Sci-Fi movie.  But, it had a story which wasn't blatantly obvious at first and some good action scenes that made sense and fit  the movie.  All in all, it was just fun.  I think some people may ding the movie for the ending, but honestly, it was slightly different and not completely predictable Hollywood formula.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|use to love this app,  but now it is just frustrating,  too many commercials,  too much homework that gets you nowhere,  the most recent update also took away the mystery seed trick,  it use to be that a mystery seed was a rare plant if it had stars after you fed it once. now they all do,  I planted 15 in a row and none ended up being rare,  this app use to be fun,  why change?  also don't ever open treasure chests unless they are free,  they are never worth it.
0385341008|5.0|It was so interesting.  Made me want to write letters, and have them to reread without turning on a computer.  the  history of the book makes it.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My grandchildren range between 5 1/2 to 2 years of age.  They all love to play on the ipad with this app.  It keeps them busy and out of mischief, especially when we're out in a restaurant.  It's great!
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Originally broadcast in America with dubbed voice over and the original is fantastic with it's original Australian lingo. Mel Gibson was a hottie!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book five runs parallel to book four for a time.  Where book four focused more on King's Landing and Dorne, book five takes us back up north to the Wall, and to Meereen and Daenerys.<br /><br />All I can say is that I could not put this one down, and finished it in record time!!!  There are some cliffhangers, of course, and if my fellow readers are anything like me, they'll be chomping at the bit waiting for book six to come out!<br /><br />I highly recommend this one to anyone who has read the previous novels.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The original outer space beast that many others have tried to replicate but the original is the best ever!! I also love Sigourney....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Quite addictive. The story does not drag for long, even though the setting of the series is in the early 1900s.
B00AEBBA1I|5.0|I had wanted this DVD for a long time and finally got it on Blu-ray. I am extremely pleased. I have been a Depp fan 4ever!
B000WAEK0E|3.0|I'm not going to review the set. If you like Van Morrison, you pretty much know what you're getting. It's nice that some Them songs are included, but how in the world can a greatest hits package by him, not include Madame George and Ballerina.
B0039O8AQK|1.0|I thought this was going to be a great movie but got so depressed with the first 1/2 hour or so that I turned it off.
B00DJYKFXG|4.0|I have just about every Band release and when I saw this box set was coming out I jumped at the opportunity to own it.  I was excited about Disc 5 because I thought it would contain videos of The Band playing a lot of great songs that I don't have on video.  Unfortunately, there are only 2 videos on the entire disc.  I wouldn't be as disappointed if I would have known upfront that only King Harvest and W.S. Walcott were the only actual videos.
B000B8QG22|4.0|Robin Williams was great. Ending was sort of anti-climatic. Story was well put together. I would recommend it to baby-boomers especially.
B00AZRBLHO|2.0|Although I have thick filter against business books, that book came my way thru some tweets and then strange conversations...<br />Disclaimer: Those comments are solely my own opinion. I'm not trying to prove anything right or wrong! It is just an action of expressing my opinion in free style...<br /><br />That story is like... yet another classical hollywood movie script, but more of a fast food type!<br />You can hear the trailer: one man, one company, one destiny, splash boom effects effects! etc etc...<br /><br />I couldn't stop myself in repeating; \\"and? and then? so then?\\" while suffering with the cramps in my stomach!<br />Especially whenever I read parts which sounds like; \\"developers are the usual suspect, they always do evil things\\" and so on!<br /><br />Look around you, and try to list down the most innovative companies.<br />You'll find out that most of them, I even argue that all of them, are development aka 'production' centric, never 'operations' centric!<br /><br />This book... keeps talking about side effects of corporate mentality, mostly from operations perspective.<br />Though, it keeps going in the direction of process-centric approach more than action-centric culture!<br /><br />Anyways... if you want to read fast food type \\"clich&eacute;\\" book, go for this one!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Everyone should own this classic. A real keeper. I never get tire of watich this mvie. Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison are super together!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I recommend this to anyone with a pulse, and brain. I didn't want to put it down, you won't either.
B00CBRH4YU|2.0|This movie could have been a good story but it was cut up into segments that consisted of people wondering non stop. I though to myself while watching it &#34;if they show one more scene of people aimlessly wondering I am going to scream!&#34; Not worth the money I spent to rent it. Total flop! It is odd to me such a good cast would perform in such a crappy movie.
B0091REZMW|3.0|We'll see how it goes getting further into the game. Hope I don't have to spend real money or I'll have to delete.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Suspenseful and action packed. Great movie! The best Tom Cruise movie I have ever seen. Better than the spy movies.
B000W9399S|5.0|This is a good book.  Light Fantasy reading I guess I'd call it. By which I mean you don't get bogged down with descriptions and huge casts of characters.<br />Rincewind and Twoflower were quite opposites and had a fun dynamic.<br />The world is imaginative and never boring.<br />Lots of action, even though Rincewind doesn't want it.<br />This is my first discworld novel and it was definitely successful in making me fall in love with the world.  I am currently downloading the next book.  I can't wait to find out what happens with the wizard and if we will ever know what the spell does.
B004RGHWIQ|4.0|I had originally seen this movie in the theater with my wife. I really liked the story. It was definitely different, and has that Tim Burton touch mixed with Hayao Miyazaki's style (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, etc - if you have not heard or seen any of Hayao Miyazaki's movies - check them out - AMAZING!). Some people say Coraline is ok for all ages, but it is not in my opinion. Even as an adult, there are parts of this movie that are very creepy, and leave lingering feelings or akwardwardness and chills. As mentioned in some of the other Reviews, there is a great moral tied to this movie. I bought the real 3D version, that requires an actual 3D Blu-Ray Player/Playstation 3 along with a 3D TV & Glasses. I enjoyed the 3D effects in this movie. In particular, there are parts that are beyond visually stunning.<br /><br />If you have not seen this movie, and like animated films with some edge, this is worth watching. Good voice acting, great animation/Quality Graphics, and really has both sides of a coin incorporated, where much of the movie is Dark Colors but then parts where there are incredibly vibrant colors and visually enticing moments of psychedelia, oh yeah!! It's not a 5 star movie in my opinion, but I give it 4 stars for originality, good story and characters, good moral, and great as far as visual quality.<br /><br />If nothing else, give this movie a rent. A bought the movie to add to my expanding  collection of 3D movies, and after watching this with my wife the other night, I am happy and stand by my purchase =)
B007N8RULO|5.0|I can never play just one game.  It is a lot of fun.  It can be a challenge on some games.  It's a challenge trying to beat your own time and moves.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It is hard but fun. I'm so happy the game is out its hilarious and is great and so many people watched the video and would love the game. It is a great game and I recommend it if you like the video.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Had a difficult time putting this story down.  Loved how all the characters come together and you learn more about the past.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The imagery is wonderful, great to read hard to put down! I really could go on forever, so I'll just say, Read this book!!
B009ZABU7S|3.0|I was planning on using this to help a friend learn English, but I would like to have an American English version.<br />It doesn't recognize what I am saying, and I speak English, so that part of it useless.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I found this product to be very well made, it works on windows 8 and mac ios. The lights are very visible through the dark smokey shell. well constructed cable components.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for people of all ages, would definitely suggest playing. My little cousin got me hooked, and I can't stop playing when no Wi-Fi is available
B00EUIO8Y2|2.0|At least Madonna has made statements acknowledging the error of bad sound in this release. The crowd noise sounds incredibly artificial, pumped up way too much for most of the album. Instruments & background vocals aren't loud enough, and her singing isn't always at its best either. I shouldn't have to see the visuals to accept that too much dancing throws off your vocal game. Her last tour release was mixed far better. When all this gets worked out, I expect Amazon to offer a replacement or refund for my purchase.
031623480X|5.0|The sooner you read this fascinating book and begin applying Dr. Perlmutter's principles to your lifestyle, the sooner you will experience the amazing beneficial effects of Dr. Perlmutter's advice. The book is wonderfully written in language that the lay person can easily understand. Dr. Perlmutter brings his extensive experience and superior intellect to the table in attacking some of the major causes of ill health and less than optimum brain function. Without reservation, I recommend this book to all who care about their personal well being.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I saw the movie first and only read the book on the recommendation of a friend.  Boy i'm glad i read it.  Very little in common between the two.
B000TEPKS4|1.0|This wasn't what I was looking for so I said I hated it. Not my type of music. I really like a refund.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I ordered this CD.  I saw all the great reviews and thought I would give it a shot.  Glad I did!
B000FBFN1U|3.0|I'm hooked and will brave it out to the ( probably bloody) end. But it could be a LOT shorter.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|being a Fallout fan, I was recommended this book by a friend and I must say I'm very happy about that. this book was impossible to put down.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved the style of the writing. Since my book was on Kindle, it was very difficult to look at the end notes while reading. I wish the book would have explored more about where the virus might have come from and why didn't they try harder to find a vaccine. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the read.
0756655307|4.0|I really like the info on this book. Nice to have for looking up basic facts \ history. My only gripe is the artwork is inconsistent. I wish everyone ( character) could get a full page.  So if your looking for a guide or are new to the Marvel universe  pick this up...
B0012GMVSU|5.0|I absolutely love this score. The music is nothing less than spectacular. I recommend pretty much every musical score Alan Silvestri has done.
B00DYXBAMC|5.0|This is a fantastic first album by Zendaya. I've seen her twice in concert before her first single was released, and thought she was a great live performer with a great ability to engage the audience. The songs on this debut CD surprised me, they take her singing in a direction different then her previous work on Disney soundtracks, and really showcase her vocal talents.
B00915G6SU|5.0|We love the show and purchase each season on DVD as soon as we can. This is a great product and works perfectly. We're looking forward to many years of enjoyment from it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The concept for this fantasy novel is a winner, no doubt about it. A decadent government that chooses to use its talented youth in a group death match for the viewing entertainment of the populous deserves to be starved out of existence. Its iron-grip control of the situation is unquestioned, however, and our young characters are locked into a struggle for survival. We are just along for the ride.<br /><br />It isn't enough that there are girls as young as 12 who have to fight for their lives, but they have to find a way to battle or outsmart those who are older, bigger and, for all practical purposes, professionals at this bloody event. The cruelty and cold calculation of the participants as well as the organizers of the Hunger Games pretty much make this the ultimate reality show. The Biggest Winners are those who get to keep their lives, horribly changed as they would be.<br /><br />We follow the progress of the main characters in their selection, preparation and then the actual playing of the Games as told in the first person by a young female whose skills in the outdoors give her something to compete with in the wilds of the vast \\"arena\\" created by the organizers.<br /><br />Well told, this story has adventure and romance at the teenage level to complement the twisted tale of a society gone wrong. My teen years are far in my rear view mirror, but I enjoyed this tale and you probably will also.
0385743564|5.0|'Steelheart\\" is easily Brandon Sanderson's best work to date.  The writing is tight, the action is hyperkinetic, and the characters and plot flow seamlessly together to create a page-turner of a book with  not a single wasted word or scene.  Sanderson returns to some of the same themes from his adult novels, where individuals are given powers that set them apart from mortals, except this time he does it here on Earth, and the Chicago based setting makes this a more believeable story.  This is scifi, not fantasy, and it's really good.<br /><br />I'll be recommending this book to many friends with high-school aged readers, and will also be talking it up to kids in grades 6 and up.  I will eagerly read the sequel when it comes out next Fall.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|The first few chapters to introduce ashmole 782 were hard to get through but once it got going-like the romantic friction between Diana and Matthew- it never stopped. There were a few places where I had trouble keeping up and making connections (possible \\"loop holes\\" in the information presented?) but I never felt like I wasn't going to get something out of it or that I was becoming a team Edward tween for continuing to read it. Harkness kept my moth like attention span in check and has me coming back for more. Overall a pretty good read.
B00E5C3AJM|4.0|I really enjoy this game, when it works! I love the clothes, and dressing up my avatars. It's a cool distraction. I recommend it.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I had to read this for my honors English class, and I expected a boring typical reading assignment.  What I found was a great mystery story that had me guessing what would happen all the way to the end.  I would highly recommend this book.  Enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|not like XBOX edition but it might have more than the XBOX edition.you should save your money in till minecraft pocket edition 1.0.0 updatecomes out.this is the best game I love it.it doesn't have a lot but it's good
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|There are very few options relative to stations.<br />I did like the buffering feature, it appears the show is buffered on the device in its entirety and then played. Had NO buffering issues during the movie and the quality was perfect!
B002XXNSF6|5.0|Great movie. Will remind you of those youthful trips while traveling abroad. The actors also provide the audience with some very memorable scenes.
1609611543|5.0|At the beginning of the summer I went on a wheat free diet after reading this book recommended by my cousin Eleanor. This book has changed my life. After many years of following the multi-grain diets so recommended for us, I realize I was in a self defeating situation and have finally begun to lose weight. There have been some unexpected side effects in addition to weight loss. Since my shoulder surgery four years ago I have had terrible arthritis in that shoulder since the repair could not be 100%. My arthritis pain has reduced significantly. Not completely gone but about 70%. The same can be said for pain from the torn cartilage in my knee. You probably want to know the grand total which is 32 pounds in three and a half months. I am also down to the last hole in the belt and will have to start punching new ones. Soon I will be replacing my wardrobe. All this mind you with no other change to my routine; only the elimination of wheat from my diet. If someone is struggling like I was, I recommend this book.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|To begin with I had no real ambition of seeing this film in theaters so I just waited til it came out on blu ray. As the title says this is a different kind of 'zombie' movie than you've probably seen. These infected creatures move with a purpose, and while it may not be quite as scary as your slower creepier moving zombie, it is still altogether effective.<br /><br />Not a huge Brad Pitt fan but he does a decent job in this movie, though not without keeping the hero role. I never read the book so I can't really compare it's faithfulness. The most unfortunate part of the film is that it suffers from formulaic zombie plot-itis (which has become all too common these days), it's also probably 15 minutes too long.
0316056898|5.0|A definite must read if you would like to be entertained. Tina Fey is is hilarious writter! Also enjoyable as an audio book, since Tina herself is the narrator.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to set up, great picture quality, sounds great.<br /><br />the only negative so far is the lack of support from HBOgo, Showtimego, Amazon and such.
0785153942|3.0|Let me be clear -- I loved the movie.  It's definitely my favorite of 2013, and it's probably in the top five for the last few years.  This graphic novel serves as a useful compendium to the film's story.  But it's really only for die-hard fans.  By itself, the story is wafer thin and doesn't break any new or interesting ground.  It's exceptional short and can be finished in under twenty minutes.  In reality, the novel could honestly be a series of concept sketches that just didn't make it to film.  For which they had to write some kind of story around.<br /><br />As a reader, we learn a few facts that are interesting to the universe, but that are ultimately not interesting in this form.  The characters are quickly introduced and just as quickly discarded.  The format in which it is told (a reporter interviewing about year zero) is fairly cliche.  Additionally, it's clear that some details of the movie were just not understood when this book was written, as several characters depart from their actor's appearances and mannerisms.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is only for people who love the universe and literally have to own everything from it.  I enjoyed it for what it was, but it's clear that it is not for a wide audience.
B00819ER0Q|5.0|It is a very interesting movie, funny, and thought provocative. A must see. Don't want to give anything away or spoil it so that is all I will say about it.
030758836X|4.0|This was a really good book! I really enjoyed the writing style of Ms. Flynn and would love to read her other books as well. I started this book a couple weeks ago and like it, but didn't feel the need to always be reading it. This probably had more to do with just being busy and having tons of things going on in my life. But then, a couple days ago, I sat down and was determined to finally finish the book. When I got back in to reading it, I couldn't put it down! There are so many twists that you don't expect and the characters are quite... interesting. I never really knew what was going to happen next and then when everything started falling together, I couldn't believe it! The ending was very strange, and I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. I think it actually fits the story really well, since the entire story is crazy. Normally, I wouldn't like this ending at all. But like I said, it fits the story and the characters! This was a great work of fiction by Gillian Flynn, and I can definitely see what all the hype is about! I highly recommend this to everyone, especially those who love mysteries and thrillers. :)<br /><br />pagesofcomfort.blogspot.com

B006S08RLU|1.0|Well,really wanted to own this movie,and I will in the future but should have just gone to buy it at the store.This version said that it would not load because I lived in the wrong area.Immediatly it was almost impossible to open the box.

B00BXJZ07A|4.0|[[ASIN:B00BXJZ07A Elvis Club]]Yes they still have it! After a long absence and the addition of Steve Almaas of Beat Rodeo on Bass, Scott Kempner, Roscoe Ambel and Frank Funaro are back with a record, as good as any they've done before. Awesome guitar driven Rock and Roll.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|An easy read with a lot of fun facts & history.<br />Terrific for bedtime or sharing. Thanks for the tip Cylas.
B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|Bill gives a nice overview of historical events as well as travel information.  His descriptions are colorful and his story telling is entertaining.  I thought he was more interested in the feel and culture of the place than just in his own egotistical relationship with the people and places he visited.  I like that aspect in his writing. You can surmise from his writing that he genuinely likes traveling to this continent.  I recommend this book as an interesting read, especially if one is planning to travel to Australia.
B00BQ1D9AA|5.0|Classic blues rock fusion.Great sound quality Three masters at the top of their game. Not a bad track on the album. Minor gripe, no info about the songs or backup musicians on the album.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|Great game, lots of fun, but it doesn't work well on the Kindle.  The latest update caused it to start freezing up at regular intervals.  I even tried removing it from the device and re-installing it (which deleted my character), and it still froze up every few seconds.
B00E34A9FU|4.0|\\"The rock music group Grateful Dead is scheduled to perform at a 'potluck picnic' Sunday, sponsored by the Springfield Creamery.\\"  Eugene Register-Guard Newspaper.<br /><br />\\"Do you hear that same sweet sound again?\\"  \\"Bird Song\\".<br /><br />For Deadheads this was (is) a mythical concert from 1972. And now, finally, it's being released in it's entirety along with a DVD (or Blue-Ray) of (most of) the concert.  Over the years this concert has risen in many fan's eyes as a musical --almost spiritual--highlight of The Dead's many great sets.  This concert was just after the band had returned from Europe, which has provided fans (like me) with many hours of great music.  And this set is no different.  As Garcia has said \\"...the music played the band.\\"<br /><br />The band still had that looseness that's so much a part of their music.  But their playing was as intuitive and as tight as I've ever heard--and besides albums, I was lucky enough to steadily hear them live--indoors and out--in the Bay Area from '68 through '70, and sporadically thereafter.  Because of what The Dead do with the music, their playing can sometimes be ramshackle--they can lose that thread that holds everything together.  But not here. Not this time.  Everyone plays as one mind--in control but always searching, exploring for that key that unlocks the music for both the band and the audience.<br /><br />A benefit for the Kesey Creamery, (people were afraid that someone would dose the kiddies' milk and cancelled contracts) it was also the last true meeting up with The Pranksters.  The hot sun (\\"We're changing our name to the Sun-Stroked Serenaders\\"--Bob Weir.) kept the instruments out of tune, but the band somehow got past that and played a tremendous set.  During the concert the band became so focused on the music that they played through all the problems.  And the lucky attendees found shade under any available trees and and just enjoyed The Dead  playing a mythical set of music--which the DVD bears out.<br /><br />All you need to do is hear the band begin to slide into \\"Sugaree\\", and then \\"Black-Throated Wind\\".  And on into \\"China Cat..Rider\\" (whoa!) and you know you're hearing something special.  But listen to \\"Bertha\\" (a personal favorite), or the 20 minute \\"Playing In The Band\\", a lively \\"He's Gone\\", and The Dead rarity \\"Bird Song\\".  And even after hearing  a number of good/great versions of \\"Dark Star\\" from the \\"Europe '72\\" set, the 31 minute version here is a standout.  There's the beautiful \\"Sing Me Back Home\\", followed by a fine \\"Sugar Magnolia\\".  And these are just a few high points.  Deadheads will have their own favorites.  And I have to say that Garcia is simply on fire.  Just listen to where he takes the music on \\"Playing...\\" for example.  And he doesn't build up to something--he's doing it from the start.<br /><br />But there's moments like that all over this set.  And it doesn't matter where or when it happens because it will happen.  This is one of those special times for band and audience alike.  Garcia fans will definitely not be disappointed.  As for the rest of the band--after the Europe trip--you can hear how well they're playing literally from the beginning.  For fans of early Dead (like me) this is about as good as it gets--and I've been a fan (this was before the term \\"Deadhead\\" was coined) since their first vinyl album release.<br /><br /> I still remember buying their first album (with the weird cover that suggested that this was something different) and slipping the album onto my stereo (the kind where the speakers are attached  to the turntable with very short wire) and hearing \\"Cream Puff War\\", \\"New New Minglewood Blues\\", and \\"Viola Lee Blues\\".  Hmmm.  This was something new.  From that point I never missed a new Dead album. I even came across (the now) vinyl rarities \\"Historic Dead\\" and \\"Vintage Dead\\", which was full of live and mysterious music.  But if you're not into this period of the band that much--this may change your mind--after blowing it.<br /><br />The DVD is a good quality look at the whole adventure--shot on \\"spec\\".  And as apparently loaded on LSD as many others, the film-makers managed to document almost everything (there's some tracks missing from the film) that went down on that sunny Sunday.  Garcia was surprised that anyone wanted to film the band--\\"Why?  We just stand there.  We don't do anything.\\"  But having a visual account of the concert is well worth having for views of both fans and the band.  The film taps into what the Grateful Dead experience was all about.  The sound and picture is better than you might think.  Having the complete audio concert is something special--but having the visual record of that day is something altogether different.  The film elevates everything to a higher level.  This edition has no booklet--just a short essay by David Lemieux about the concert, inside the quad-fold packaging.<br /><br />I should let people know that this is also available through The Dead website as a limited (12,500) edition.  At a higher price you get a 40 page booklet with essays by David Lemieux and others, a tie-dye slipcase, and an exclusive bonus documentary \\"Grateful Days\\" with new interviews with Mountain Girl, Ken Babbs, Wavy Gravy, and others.  But for most Deadheads the music is the most important thing, so this \\"regular\\" edition will do nicely.  It's nice to finally have this historic set available in good sound and visuals.  This can sit next to \\"Europe '72\\" with no problem.  And don't forget the NRPS' live set, also from the same Veneta Dead concert.  Up next is the Garcia/Legion Of Mary set, coming soon.-after blowing it.<br /><br />The DVD is a good quality look at the whole adventure--shot on \\"spec\\".

0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a book of a fascinating story with delicate ideas and attractive plots. Moreover, it is these vivid pencil drawings that make the book so unique and compelling, and distinguish it from other common children's books. The first part of the book just goes with images, which is a great example of how the story was told by pictures instead of only by words. The readers get all understandings of the book from these illustrations. It started with the picture of the moon, zooming in on the scene of Paris, the train station, and finally the character, Hugo, just as the beginning of a movie. One of the most impressive images to me is that Hugo held the handkerchief with ashes of \\"his notebook\\" in it (137). It not only pushes forward the development of the plots in this novel, but also firmly connects to the main topic \\"dream\\". The ashes not only represent the dream of Hugo, but also firmly relate to the dream of Papa George.
B004X80QNG|4.0|[EDITED: 22 Sept 2013 seems to be running better, raised +1 star to 4 stars]<br /><br />I got this app as the FAOTD, for the price of free it was certainly worth checking out.<br /><br />The usefulness and rating this app merits depends on your specific application. I'm using it on an Android 2.3 smartphone to sync with Google Calendar.<br /><br />I'm rating this app from the perspective of comparing it with the stock Google Gingerbread calendar, which works pretty well but lacks some features from later Android versions like event searching.<br /><br />Pluses: The aforementioned search capability that Android 2.3 otherwise lacks in its calendar, can quickly move events +/- days or minutes<br /><br />Tie: the PI calendar has more display options than the google one, although it seems to be a heavier more resource demanding interface and responds a bit more slowly.<br /><br />Minuses: Once my calendar data seemed to disappear for a while, there is a fix for this on the play store although my calendar data came back on its own and I have not had the problem since.<br />I had some frequent force closures when I started using the app and went back to stock Android 2.3 calendar though those seem to have gone away.<br /><br />Summary: I was initially quite pleased with the calendar as an Android 2.3 stock calendar replacement. Due to the quirks I went back to google stock calendar fora while although I'm trying Pocket Informant again and it seems to be running well. I have not seem PI3 but for the same price it seems like it might be a better option. Try this one if it is free or substantially discounted.

B008X9Z37A|3.0|the one thing that I do not like about this cover is, that when I set it on the coffee table to watch a movie or if my grandson is wanting to watch something, it falls. there needs to be a strap between the front cover and the back, otherwise it does the splits and lays flat. I have to Prop it up against something. other than that, the cover is doing it's designed purpose.

B00AGKHEUI|4.0|No kidding, a store which is symbolized by a red bullseye is currently selling this 3 CD expanded edition for only $5 so it's hard for me to find fault with it, although like others I do hate the unprotected discs jammed into the cardboard case and in fact my booklet, which was jammed into the first of 4 such openings, was stuck and required losing a bit of one corner of the last page to pull it out.<br /><br />Upon listening to the first disc, I was struck by a sudden massive improvement in sound quality when \\"The Chain\\" came on, and for the remainder of the disc. I went back and compared and there is a slight quality difference between the first 6 tracks and the remaining 6. The first 6 are not bad by any means but they are inferior to the remainder for some reason.<br /><br />I fell in love with many of the outtakes/demos on disc 3. Stevie's \\"Planets Of The Universe\\" is breathtakingly beautiful and haunting in the truest sense of the term. Also, hearing Christine run through a rough version of \\"Songbird\\" with some additional lyrics was a treat, followed by a beautiful instrumental take. A simpler, drumless take of \\"Dreams\\" is also one of my faves. I haven't checked out the live disc yet. I have to recommend this if you can find a bargain like I did.

0307474259|5.0|I was amazed when I started reading this book; it is a real eye-opener that explains the science behind weight gain and weight loss, and it is not what we have been told all our lives. If you choose to buy this book, you will find out why the calories in/calories out theory doesn't work, why exercise isn't apt to work either, particularly for the long term; and you will find out what does work and why. There are apparently those who don't agree with Taubes, but the science is solidly on his side. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand why weight loss has been so difficult, and what it takes to shed the extra pounds.
B00E6887H0|5.0|My favorite new release of 2013.  Yes, most of these songs have been around for awhile.<br />Yes, most of these songs are available on previous recordings.  Some things just get<br />better with age and this live disc is proof of that.  Listening to this is like a wonderful<br />home cooked gourmet meal, satisfying and filling.  Highly recommended.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|This book of poetry was delightful, indulging, satisfying and crave-inducing. I suggest reading this one with a glass of wine and your significant other very close by.

He wants me to read SPOT SAYS GOODNIGHT over and over and let him lift the flaps.  He has fun every time.  I would suggest that every2 and 3 year old boy and girl should have the experience of enjoying and learning with the SPOT books.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's okay. It works well with Youtube and Netflix, but that's it. I hope it gets more apps. But I really hope the casting from the Chrome extension comes out of beta soon. I tried casting regular sites with video through my Macbook Pro, and though it's an old Mac and I only have Lion, it works well but does not seem to place nice with the Chromecast. The video is black and you can only hear sound. I tried casting with my husband's PC, and it works but there's still still hiccups and sync issues with video and sound that just ends up being a headache if you get invested in anything. I tried everything, changing the resolution and streaming to a low setting, didn't seem to improve it. I keep waiting for them to get more apps and to have better casting from the Chrome browser. I read online that a lot of people had better luck with this; I didn't because well I can't afford the new computers. I have my old Mac which doesn't really work well with this device.

B00DPY95D6|5.0|Once in awhile, I pick up a book that is a bit off the beaten path in order to ensure that I am always branching a bit. Generally, those books are disappointing, but this one made taking that chance well worth it. This was everything I love in a book. A suspenseful, engaging, SMART page-turner. If you like courtroom drama, suspense, thrills, and intensity, this is the book for you!
161655164X|5.0|I love looking at concept art for my favorite games, and The Last of Us definitely made that list. Originally I was going to buy this from a manga/comic store, but the price was $40. I like to support local comic stores, but the price differential was too great.<br /><br />If you are interested in seeing lots of amazing concept art for this game, you will not be disappointed. This book also contains lots of information about the though that went into the character creation and scenery. There is an insane amount of thought that went into the smallest details in the game (and it shows).<br /><br />As expected with art books, I would suggest beating the game first, then going through the book so that you don't spoil anything for yourself. The game is amazing and the art book does not disappoint.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love solving the the puzzles and gathering the clues and items needed to escape the room. Very entertaining and enjoyable.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|There are two pitfalls of instrumental metal. One, the melody and sense of groove or musicality of the art suffers at the expense of being technically tight and difficult. Two, the rhythms chug, become repetitive, and do not explore ambient sounds or meaningful lead parts. Scale the Summit has skillfully navigated between this Scylla and Charybdis.<br /><br />For musicians, you will appreciate the non-standard time signatures, syncopated rhythms, and explorations of different harmonies and melodies. Scale the Summit plays complex music, but does so effortlessly and smoothly. Their YouTube channel also offers many playthroughs of their music.<br /><br />For non-musicians, you will appreciate the melodies. Most songs have catchy parts that get stuck in your head, even though it's quite technical music. The music is solid, neither cheesy gimmick nor plain soul-less strings of notes.<br /><br />I have listened to this album dozens of times, closely and casually, and it has lost none of its flare. I can listen to this album in the background when I read, or I can concentrate on it and dissect its layers. Both methods are rewarding. This is an excellent album that I would recommend to anyone who loves instrumental music or hard rock.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I never thought I would read this book until one night my husband started reading it to me. I found it interesting enough to buy the book! I am not a fast reader but finished this in 2 weeks which is awesome for me! I found that I couldn't put it down and look forward to part 2. The author uses the word murmur WAY tooo much along with &#34;inner goddess&#34; phrase....she should've thought that out since it is repeated on almost every page which makes it look like lazy writing . Overall, I enjoyed reading this book!

1781162646|4.0|This was a very good read but not what I expected from Stephen King. It was not creepy. I like carnival creepy books which is why I bought it, but this book did not satisfy me in that way. It really was a good story about good people, some with the gift of ESP, some with dysfunctional issues. It does have an element of mystery. The end of the book was quite surprising, which seems to be a Stephen King gimmick. The writing was done very well and keeps you interested right up to the very end. I would have liked the story to continue to see what happens in the life of some of the characters.
B009RX8MQ0|4.0|A deeply involving, well-written, acted & directed \\"Soap,\\" which I'm sure all those who are fascinated by the daytime soaps like \\"Days of our Lives\\" will truly appreciate. I especially could relate to poor beleaguered Jack, Amanda's childhood friend, who near the end remarks to her. \\"I'm tired of all these half-truths and secrets....\\" Yes! So was I long before he said it. And my complaint  about the acting (& directing) style continues with this film series where the dialogue so often descends into needless whispering & mumbling so that I, for one, cannot understand what is being said. Emily VanCamp has a soft voice which is not easy to understand as it is - totally lost in certain cases. Proper dicrion & enunciation used to be part of acting lessons - apparently no more & the audience is not so important anymore it seems. Have these actors done any stage plays? I think Emily would find herself hard-pressed in that venue.<br /><br />Of course, the film to a certain degree raises questions about revenge & that would have been I think proper to develop more, but in any case if you like to spend your time just sitting & watching something interesting, \\"Revenge\\" does fit that category.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Challenging and enjoyable game so far.  The timer makes it a lot tougher than your average HO scenes. Am looking forward to playing more of it.

B003G4W49C|5.0|This story was very good and hard to put down. It chronicled the story of Ender Wiggin, a boy that was forced to grow up to fast. The challenges that he faced and obstacles that were put in his way by the adults in his life to bring out his true potential were fascinating. This books end really raised some thought provoking questions about fighting and the aftermath of war.

B00E5Q1HJS|3.0|I'm not a writer and don't know what could have made this better.  All I can do is share my feelings and I was left wanting more, waiting for something big to happen and surprise us all.  The space dive was already done in the first film and it seems they were running with it again in this film because it was new and unique in the first.  It needed some other new gimmick to grab its audience.  In my opinion.

B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Being a private equity investor, when I talk about venture capital, I have this saying that I shoot off to every wannapreneur... ideas are dime a dozen, execution, execution, execution is the key.<br /><br />But I think I'll stop saying that after reading James Altucher's latest book Choose Yourself!<br /><br />If there's something to take away from this book... its just that, generating ideas, I now realize how weak my idea generating muscles are, and now doing some daily practice to build these... the effects are amazing! Tough to do... but amazing.<br /><br />You might have heard about James because of the sale of Stockpickr.com  (that's how I did) - in any case, let me put it this way... he's a serial entrepreneur, made his millions, invested it, sucked at quite a few things, and lived to tell the tale of it through his blog, so we can live a better life!<br /><br />Having said all this... let me tell you some other things I took away from this book. Choose Yourself! is about choosing yourself, why wait for permission from others, yes... to re-quote Nike... just do it!<br /><br />There is a paradigm shift taking place in this so called capitalistic world... as more and more are shifting to choosing themselves rather than working as a cog in a large corporate, and hating themselves and their job.<br /><br />James is asking you to head the world on... straight, honestly, courageously (without fear of rejection). And all you have to do is ask! Ask the Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram and he'll probably say the same thing...<br /><br />And what he's suggesting is a wholesome solution, focus on your physical, emotional, mental and spiritual needs. Don't do things you don't like... (I love that!!) and be happy.<br /><br />And most importantly... be ready to fail, fail so much that you accidentally become a success! This happens overnight btw. Should you buy this book? Read the above again... and just do it.
B007ZB06OW|4.0|This is the battleship from Yamato 2199, the ship is a good size ship, not too big, but not too small. Some of the parts DO require glue so don't listen to manual where it says glue is not required. Painting is not required, but the model would look better if you do paint it. Some parts a little too small and need needle pickers to attach the gun ports and etc. Otherwise, a very nice model to put together.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good graphics and fun playing aspect--though pay-for add-ons (saddles, gems, bridles, etc.) are a little pricey. Some popup ads, too, but not horribly often.
B0054EU0H0|4.0|I bought this product for use on my D3200. Another reviewer said it did fit the D3200 with some attention to detail. I can say that this does NOT fit the D3200. If one aligns the bottom and left edges of the screen protector and the screen, there is about 1/16\\" overhang of the protector. To most people, this would seem insignificant, but to me it won't work because any overhang means there is an edge for dirt and dust to collect, and a chance that the screen protector gets rubbed off on a bag, shirt, pants, etc.<br /><br />With regard to the product, the packaging was excellent. They provided a microfiber cloth and card for applying the protector, which was laminated on both sides making applying it very easy.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Good fun, love the concept. It is addictive for sure. But it has issues:<br /><br />- The daily free points screen flashes without giving you the chance to collect your points.<br />- If the zoo is full  or space is tight, and you purchase a building, it places it under animals and you don't always notice unless you edit and move your animals around to see what's underneath.  Also coins in the ground and trash often are underneath the animals. I did not notice the lobster shack was hidden and I purchased it again = $10,000.<br />- It deleted three family animals after a crash.<br />- I am at level 30 and downloaded the app in August '13 and it has not restarted at Level 1, yet.<br />- Won't let me release a saved family.<br />- Sometimes need to store/delete dirt paths in order to place animals, even though there's enough space.<br />- Everything costs too much!<br />- When advancing to the next level, don't always receive prize.<br />- Not enough gas!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I think only a parent will &#34;get&#34; this book. Like the father you want Jacob to be innocent. No matter what, you can't give up on your child. The mom's insight to her child, doesn't give her a way out.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|We used this on a recent car camping trip, and it worked nicely. I'm still torn whether I'd prefer a full-sized one or this &#34;compact&#34; one, but this was reliable, easy to use, and nice and small (relatively). It'd be nice if the handle somehow came off for easier storage, but then I'd probably just lose it and/or manage to disengage it while pouring out hot coals, so maybe this is for the best.<br /><br />The handle stayed nice and cool, and the coals got nice and hot. Recommended for camping trips with just a couple people!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Overall great book! A must read for all women would definitely recommend!<br />Especially for those starting off in the career work or in school!
B003G4W49C|3.0|Definitely a boy's book - but much better than I expected it to be. People should go into this one without knowing anything and have a low bar for expectations.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I do not have allot of time to waste and dont use it as much as most people do hope this answers a question
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|With the exception of \\"Suit and Tie\\" and \\"Mirrors\\", I cannot listen to the rest.  The tracks are way too long and repetitive and the lyrics are silly.  I don't understand how he could have two great songs and 7 stinkers.  I read another review before I bought it saying that I would only listen to the two hits.  I should have believed it. Sorry JT...
B00BGI08GG|3.0|I buy this series on blu ray because I wanted to see it in Spanish, but my surprise was great when I heard that you have audio in Castilian, even when the warner bros will understand that the Castilian accent is not like the latin neutral accent I'm disappointed! either way, do not want piracy on the street but we are forced to buy piracy with audio Latin spanish!

B00ACBN9CI|5.0|The game is a really simple fun jet simulator game. It runs smooth and is pretty addicting for those of us who enjoy a good jet fighter game.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|I heard my husband listing to it in our car and just had to buy it and listen to it at work also.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Brown has a knack for story telling. But his stories contain so much we'll researched data that the reader is dream in like a moth to light. In this tale a Senators daughter learns more than she ever thought she would about the way politics a desperation make for a hotbed of lies and receipt. Deception Point is a great yarn and masterfully spun.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|More like 3.5 stars<br /><br />Good. LONG. And the storylines are very well interwoven but OH MY GOSH I felt like it went.on.forever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Luv this game highly addictive. Can't put it away. It is a RUSH. Once u  PICK it up u will not  want to put it down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never reviewed anything ever, but this story was so amazing I just can't help but give it 5 stars. This is without a doubt my favorite series of all time. Buy this book!
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Speedy shipping, I was very happy with this purchase and look forward to purchasing other seasons in the near future!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I was a bit jolted at the abruptness with which Ender's Game ended. Don't get me wrong, I loved reading it. But with Speaker for the Dead I was hooked from beginning to end. I felt there was so much depth to the characters and the emotions at play, especially in the family the book focuses on. Card really takes his time in developing a rich, intriguing narrative. I can't wait to get my grubby hands on the third book of the quintet!
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|We couldn't wait to watch it every night.  The last episode or so wasnt as full on good, kind of goofy with the love story playing out as it did.  But still better than most things I ever watch!  We enjoyed it.
140006922X|5.0|I'm an eighty-year-old Episcopal priest who found Aslan's analysis to be superb.  It's about time for Christians to take off their blinders and substitute historic facts for the untruths that currently flood American religiosity. .
B007WULJ5G|4.0|So, with all the hype I finally sat down and watched the film. With much angst over the infant rape scene I had heard so much warning about. Yes, yes, the concept and idea of it was disturbing, but the scene itself was rather unremarkable given all the yammering about it.<br /><br />I sat there after the \\"most horrible\\" scene and thought, \\"well if this is all the film has to offer, it is going to be pretty damn boring\\". I am happy to say, I was wrong entirely. The movie as a whole was much better overall than I expected, especially given the fact that I truly thought I had \\"missed\\" something given the lack of effect the infant scene had. The acting was actually fairly decent, it had a plot, and yes the movie in general was disturbing.<br /><br />I am always looking for a film that will mess with my brain. I grew up in a time where slasher and gore films were all the rage, and I lived on a steady diet of them, always trying to find the next great \\"horror\\" movie. As I grew up the slasher/gore films didn't/don't really cut it so I moved on to find movies that will leave me queasy from a psychological stand point. Something that won't let the brain settle easy after seeing it....this one fit the bill. I won't lose sleep over it, but I agree with other posts/reviews that there is a certain feeling after seeing it. Just as you think \\"there is no way what I think is going to happen, is going to happen...they would never do that\\" and next thing you know, there it is.<br /><br />I would not classify this as a horror movie, nor fully as an exploitation film, as some people have...I think it belongs in the corner by itself, in it's very own category.<br /><br />I would recommend the film to anyone that wants to watch a film that leaves them thinking \\"what the HELL did I just watch\\"?<br /><br />Fair waring you may feel like you need to take a shower after watching this film.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is worth a watch....
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is really cool when your finished with the story there is still free play which means you can still roam the city
B004I9G486|5.0|I purchased this to replace the worn out cable in my 09 Audi A5. It fit perfectly, and though some say the cord is short, it is actually about 2&#34; longer than the cord that came with the car. So far, so good!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Love Stephen King, haven't read it yet, but I'm sure it is great!  never been disappointed when reading his books.
B00BF123WG|4.0|I did enjoy this movie and I thought it was well made, unlike some of the other movies on the same subject.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I missed it on TV and couldn't get it to download on direct tv.  It was worth the price I paid.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Apparently this movie went through a lot of re-shoots and re-edits to make it better and the work they put into it shows.  Not too much pre-amble before the action kicks in very near the start.  Some genuine scary and tension-filled, edge-of-your-seat moments; you really feel like you're in the middle of it.  If you can't get on board with the notion of people becoming zombies then you probably won't get into it.  I'm not a typical zombie-film-lover and I really liked this movie. A lot of action too.  A tension-filled, worthwhile movie experience.
B008JFUO36|1.0|Dull, stupid, and starring Tom Cruise.  Notice that 500 people gave this inexcusable pile of dreck positive reviews.  America is doomed.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This is a very good game I love it bcuz you dress ur girl buy clothes and have a boyfriend!
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Without the profanity,  this movie is Project X in the 1920s.  Too many movies are replacing dialogue, plot development with complex CGI, cinematography and action scenes.  I honestly see no difference between this movie and Fast and the Furious. There's about the same level of intellectual intrigue.<br /><br />While I'm sure this movie might appeal to the thoughtless,  avoid it at all costs.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This is one of my all time 5 favorite point and click games. Never before have I not wanted a game to come to an end as I did with this one. Just finished it and I'm immediately going to play it again, it was that awesome.<br />Graphics are top-notch. Scenes are done in a simplistic manner but at the same time they are simply amazing. And scene setup easy to navigate.<br />Game play flows smoothly with no story interruptions, I love that.<br />The puzzles were so much fun to play, so well done and the clues given in order to proceed to the next step were difficult but not to the point of making the game frustrating.<br />You'll get your money's worth. There's no way you'll finish this one quickly. I didn't keep track of time but it took me several days of game playing to get through it.<br />Don't think about getting this game, just do it. It's an entertainment blast!
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app is like an attention freak,  once you use it, you can't use youtube on your browser unless you delete all cookies and everything. It is a malicious app.
B00CDXOXB4|3.0|I am glad I saw it free on Netflix. I would have paid 1.20 for it on Redbox but not $3.99 here.<br />Because this was a poor replica of a Julia Roberts classic and an M. Knight Shamylan classic.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: this movie = Sleeping with the Enemy (mostly) + The Sixth Sense. Period. I know it's hard to be original, but this is 10% original at best. For example, instead of the Carnival Scene at the school in SWE, Safe Haven has the 4th of July Parade.<br /><br />Sleeping with the Enemy is much better and hard to replicate or top.  Josh Duhamel is very good looking so that made up for it; lots of shirt-off scenes, yep. Made it worth it.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I can say that I love ordering off of amazon. I ordered this cd for my mom and honestly say she will not stop playing in the car. She addicted to it. :)

B00D8HNR2K|5.0|After hearing Came Back Haunted I had a feeling Hesitation Marks would be better than the last few. What I didn't know was just how good. I have listened to this album for a straight week and I've got to say it has grown more on me than any other album ever has. There are a few tracks that I initially rated 3 stars in iTunes but now I can't understand why I gave them anything less than 5. For example, Find My Way, if you are a fan of Beside You In Time this sounds like its brooding offspring. I have NO idea how I missed that... WTF.<br /><br />I have to be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of anything NIN put out after With Teeth. Year Zero was just ok, Ghosts seemed like it was weird for the sake of being weird and The Slip, well, lets just say I no longer listen to that album. But since Reznor once created such suburb albums as The Downward Spiral and The Fragile I don't think I will ever stop giving him a chance. And I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />Upon first listen I was pleased from what I heard but it grew on me 10 fold. My favorites are Find My Way, Satellite which sounds a little poppy but is NIN's new industrial sound, quite catchy if I may say so. One that I liked immediately was All Time Low, which is a strange amalgamation of funk and industrial, sounds strange I know but because it is done so well it was my first favorite. Come Back Haunted, Copy of A, Various Methods of Escape, While I'm Still Here, In Two and Black Noise are also fantastic. There is seriously this strange noise 3/4 of the way through the remix of While I'm Still Here that I hear now when I think of this album. It's almost like his music 'came back haunted'. -Pff sorry. It's the brilliant things like that though that make Reznor's music stand out. Good job Trent. Sorry I ever doubted you.
B00A0A6F7C|4.0|What a voice.  Loved every song.  She is one of those people who if we didn't have these talent shows in England and here would not have been found.
B0090O07S2|5.0|Hats off to the people that did this!  They took a marginal show and brought it back to todays standards as though it was filmed today with great definition of video and sound...  Greatness...

B0081336FO|5.0|Season 2 is amazing. Some of the best tv out there. If you like mystery, you'll love Sherlock! You will not be sad you did!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed the multiple plots and the parallel stories of the characters so I rated it a four but I couldn't go higher because the book dragged on for me. I kept trying to solve the mysteries that seemed to be unsolvable. But, the last chapter brilliantly ties up the whole book.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The book isn't very long, but as a quick summary of one of the most inventive men that ever lived, it's perfect.

B0049IHX2C|5.0|Love Will Smith. All of the men in black movies are good. This one is my favorite. Fun movie to watch with friends
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Timeless Classic. Nicely filmed, good story flow, superb acting. You get drawn into what happens to all the characters as the story is historically accurate with only a few &#34;Hollywood&#34; twists thrown in.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Family and I watched the first movie as a refresher and this one a couple nights apart.  We really enjoyed the pacing and character development, such as it was, in the second; everyone was more confident in their roles and you could see that the screen time was attempted to be doled out more equally to the ensemble cast.  The growing interplay between Spock and Kirk was great to see, but I'm always amused by the antics of Bones.  Good to see him get in on more of the action.  The Enterprise and her crew must track down a domestic terrorist with unforeseen consequences. The Blu-ray image and sound quality are top notch. CG has come quite a way since prior reference work like the Star Wars prequels and I much prefer the noticeable 'grittiness' of these effects compared to the smooth sterile worlds of SW. 4.5 out of 5.
B00D5LC4GY|2.0|the touch response is off,pieces don't land where u want a 3rd of the time, and your finger has to be over blocking your view. its also reduntantly easy. needs serious polishing to keep.  pieces are basically near where they go rather then shuffled.<br /><br />What's with the gibberish level names?
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|great game reminds me of playing the real thing as a kid. like the way you don't have to pay to keep playing.

B008476HBM|5.0|Great experience with this seller.I now adore eBooks and love Jane Austen. Will definitely buy from this great seller again!
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Great game if you like time management/strategy games. You can continue after your time has run out, just no gold star, then you can go back and try again. Have it on PC also and this kindle version seems to be working well,  no problems so far. So even if time management is not your cup of tea, you can still enjoy this cute game. A lot of fun!
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I've never read a book where the author spent so much time describing the protagonists' clothing.  Might as well read a women's fashion magazine.

B0053FANQS|5.0|Love all these movies. I love the racing and the actors. Bought this for my collection. A must have. Action packed
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very well written. Made you feel as though you were on the journey with him. Hard to put the book down
B0035S996U|5.0|Contemporary take on &#34;The Odyssey&#34; in this cult and maybe classic 1970's Walter Hill film. Lots of fun. Innovative screenplay.  If you have a school aged teen who can't quite relate to his or her school assignment reading some abridged version of Odysseus' 10 year journey home, watch this film of a Coney Island gang, the Warriors, journey home mostly by subway and occasionally by foot from a huge gang pow wow in the Bronx, some 20 miles away, where they are wrongly accused of murdering Cyrus, the warlord of the largest gang in NYC. Gang after gang in each section and turf of every mile between the Bronx and Coney Island, tries to lure, catch or kill each member of the Warriors for their alleged shooting of Cyrus. &#34;Warriors, come out and play!&#34; Watch it.
0553296981|5.0|My 12yr old grand daughter had summer reading to do and I picked up this book for her. At first she didn't seem to be interested. But, after one of the counselors at the boys and girls club explained to her, how much the girl was like everyday girls, she had to read it and was hooked.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|What to say that has not already been said or reviewed.  I enjoyed the story when it was first published and I still enjoy it today.  I revisit it every couple of years as I do with all my favorites.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Super good movie. Love Tom Cruise! This movie keeps you on your toes at all times. Unexpected twists all over !
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Bought this for my grandchildren.  Their parents watched it when they were kids and I thought they would also enjoy it. They did!
B00D82BNLC|5.0|This book was given in exchange for a fair and honest review!!<br />Though this book is fictional, i was right in the middle of it. I felt as though it was an episode from one of my favorite television shows, \\"X-Files\\". The author does a magnificent job of stringing together a sensational and suspenseful plot and decorated with vivid and precise details. I confess that i normally am not into sci-fi or anything except the aforementioned tv show, but this book that Carolyn Bennett wrote was superb. Cannot wait o read more by this author.

B00DPY95D6|4.0|Cheryl, a bankruptcy lawyer, finds herself in the middle of a political nightmare with a case that could have major financial repercussions. Fighting for her professional life, her search for answers is hampered by bizarre events effecting her personal life. Drugs, gang stalking, demons and spirits, and an unexpected pregnancy cause her life to spiral downward towards a potential nervous breakdown.<br /><br />This is an exciting look into the life of a female lawyer, fighting the \\"good ol' boys\\" mentality of her profession. It's obvious the author has personal experience with courtroom procedure, making it interesting to follow along with the scenes.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really liked this book a lot, I liked the way the story continued to develop and we learn more interesting things about the world.<br />I also like how it parallels our current society under the current administration: All the money and the power is located in one city. The people there live wonderful lives and know absolutely nothing about the rest of the country, many of whom are suffering under the rules of the current leaders.<br />It's like the Marriage of Figaro just before the French Revolution. I wonder if the people in hollywood will realize just how inflammatory the story is and alter the movie to protect their 'great' leader?
B00BNUBK46|4.0|used it elk hunting the last 3 weeks is pretty awsome for packing at night its super bright and has a wide range. but the batteries only last about 3 hours but all in all its been a good light for the price

055358894X|5.0|I have a soft spot for fantasy books about thieves and this was a brilliant book with that kind of focus. The story focuses on the clever Lock Lamora and the band of Genteleman Bastards that commit robberies with him. Unfortunately, things don't end up going very well for Locke and his friends during the course of this book and we live through those events with them.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. It is told in alternating time lines with parts set in the present and parts set in Locke's past. This can be difficult to pull off but it worked really well in this book. As we get to know Locke and his friends as an adult we also get to see him as a child and see the events that shaped his life. The book is really well written and flows from chapter to chapter. I stopped reading everything else partway through this book so I could focus on just this story. There is a lot of action and quite a bit of humor throughout the book. There is also quite a bit of violence in this book, so I would warn off anyone that is a little squeamish.<br /><br />This book really excels in the characters. Locke is clever and comes up with brilliant plans, but he is also a terrible fighter and things don't always go the way he wants. His flaws make him so much more realistic and interesting. Jean is another great multi-dimensional character and a nice balance to Locke. In fact all of the Gentleman Bastards has something to love about them. I loved reading about their camaraderie and it's great to see Locke willing to go to his friends for help when things go wrong. They work as a team, it's not just Locke on his own trying to achieve things. The interactions and relationship between these characters makes this book adds a lot of depth to the story and involves you in it even more.<br /><br />I would recommend this to fans of The Name of the Wind - this book has more humor but an interesting story and characters. To fans of the Riyria Revelations - though this book has quite a bit more violence and it more graphic. To fans of Mistborn - because it is a great book about thiefs. And I recommend this to to pretty much any fan of fantasy because this book is brilliant. I disappointed that it took me so long to get to this book but I am very excited to read the next one.e violence and it more graphic. To fans of Mistborn - because it is a great book about thiefs.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Ms Kerman has a very accurate representation of the state of the American prison system.  While she touches on the potential abuse of power that is fostered by the system, her representation is very tame in nature. Excellent read!
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|The more of this I read, the more it drew me in. It got better as it went on and the hero became more interesting, in spite or, or maybe because of, his flaws. Some questions are answered in this first book, others are not and I will be very interested to see how they are in the next book.<br />I enjoyed it.
B00ET9T2WK|1.0|Only get if you want to wait 5 minutes for the game to load the menu. Other parts of the game are even slower. This might be a good game if they can speed up the loading process.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Was really good I knew I'd have to pay eventually but was worth it just wish the game lasted longer.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|I am glad I did not pay a theater ticket for this movie. It is entertaining but didn't leave up to its hype. I put two stars instead of three because Amazon streaming services had issues showing the movie in HD. Checked speed and Netflix and they worked perfectly.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Great ! Have only used IT A few weeks BUT VERY HAPPY. Gives all other apps something to strive for.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching the film, I wasn't surprised to find lots of details missing from the movie in the book. It is a very easy reading, with what starts as a simple story moves forward and turns into a little kind of political story. Of course, not very deep, but with some hints of it, enough to keep you following the characters that weren't that developed for the screen.
B00BXHLM1K|5.0|This 2013 production of Rigoletto at The Met in 2013 is simply outstanding....and the DVD is a worthy addition to any collection of opera DVDs. Set in Las Vegas in the &#34;rat pack&#34; era, the production values are just outstanding....and I have to confess to being an &#34;old school&#34; opera fan, not normally enamored with transpositions of operas into modern settings! This production, however, works brilliantly in every respect. Zeljko Lucic was simply superb as Rigoletto, and Diana Damrau was all quality. Her &#34;Caro Nome&#34; was a highlight. Piotr Beczala was, as always, perfect. In a word....crisp!<br />The absolute highlight was the &#34;Bella figlia dell'amore&#34; quartet....and Oksana Volkova and Stefan Kocan deserve special mention in this regard.<br />All in all....superb!
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I play this on Face Book, I love the game there, but this game is useless to me, as I am away from an Internet connection a lot of the time. Was very disappointed to turn it on only to find I couldn't play the game.<br /><br />It is a fun game. But only as fun as the nearest WiFi connection.<br /><br />It would never allow me to connect to Face Book. Not for me, too many issues.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|It has trouble loading but once the game stars, it runs pretty smoothly. It is a great game and is one that you want to play every day. I like this game and I'm 13, my little sister does too. I think this game is worth getting!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I am also reading the books and wanted to see how well the show follows, great job! I watched the whole season in a few days and passed it on to a fellow reader of the books.

B00018D3RI|4.0|If you're looking at this, you probably remember the good ol' days when Starsky and Hutch had their weekly spot on the tube.  Same ol' guys, same ol' lines.  Only problem is the original introduction music has been stripped away and some nondescript tune put in its place.  Half the nostalgia of the old shows was the theme music..., but get past that and it's still the same great blast from the past.
B00C2IJJE6|5.0|This is one of the rare movie that is enjoyed by me. Honestly, I love to watch action packed movies like \\"The Last Stand\\", \\"Taken\\", \\"Taken 2\\", \\"Unknown\\" etc. I gave this movie a try because of so many good reviews and purchased the Blu Ray from Amazon. I was glued to my chair even the running time is 140 minutes. The story line is good and the pace is fast without slowing down. Tim Robbin and Morgan Freeman gives a very excellant performance too. Repeat viewing will let one appreciate the movie more.

One is dual sided with full screen on one side and 1.85 on the other, and the other release (single sided) looks to be 1.77 only.<br />In comparing identical scenes, it seems that the dual version is the best.  The full screen shows much more of LeeLee (mostly on the bottom) and the wide screen side shows more on the sides.  The wide only dvd cuts off a bit less on the bottom/top than the dual/wide-side, version but has some of the sides cut off.<br />  In short there is no propper version released.<br />You should get all the top and bottom of the full screen, and all the side of the dual-sided wide video.<br />  This is a great movie as thriller's go, and you at least get to see more of Leelee on the full screen.  I'll have to check a vhs if available to see if it is any different.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book brought poetry and beauty to an otherwise ugly truth about humans and their quest for power.<br /><br />I can't wait for my daughter to read it.
B002QE3CTY|1.0|It's hard to read because of the way they talk. There is no rhyme or reason as to why they use the words they use. Everyone's angry no one has compassion. Then suddenly he cares about every one.... blah! So glAd it's over!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Only plays Netflix, Google Play, and Youtube. Buyer Beware of it's limitations. Setup was ok but you might as well get a roku or something with more apps.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|What a story, could not put it down. An exciting series of events, thoroughly enjoyable. You will be more enlightened once you finish the book.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I wasn't sure if I wanted to download this game because it's for children but I am so glad I did. I look forward to coming home after work to play. It's a very relaxing game. The graphics are fantastic. This is by far the cutest game I have ever played.the only thing I would change is that it takes so long to level up. This game actually taught me alot about different fish..I give this game just under 5 stars...I would highly recommend finding memo.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The dinausours make this game  so fun! Three different  parts of your Jurassic Park,<br />Land (Jurrasic) Part, Water (Aquatic) Part, and Snow (Glacier) Part.<br />IF YOU LIKE TYCOON GAMES AND DINOSAURS THIS IS YOUR GAME.<br />5 STARS DEFINITELY NO QUESTION
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One delivers a fantastic well driven sci-fi story. Cline displays robust character development and attention to minutiae that leaves the reader satisfied and eager to turn the page.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Graphically simple and beautiful, 'sugar, sugar' challenges you to use strategy and simple physics to get the sugar in the right cups. You can retry as many times as you need to complete each task.  Like 'Factory Balls' it lets you learn the strategy you need by trial and error. It's wordless and very satisfying to play.
B00BFV1K2A|5.0|Once you start reading this series, it is extremely hard to put down until you finish the entire series.<br />I recommend it to everyone who needs to be taken to another world - one full of action.<br />If you have trouble reading novels with a lot of violence then this is not the series for you, but I loved it!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great puzzle game. Lots of codes and cool national treasure things. Fun.<br />Progressively more intuitive it felt like. Waiting patiently for more levels to come.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It's similar in ways to Gladwell and others in that the author recounts a number of interesting experiments you may never have known about, but a bit lighter and only dealing with habits.  I found it interesting and read through it more quickly than I do most books.  I actually wish it went more in depth into our habits and how to stop bad ones and ingrain good ones.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was hesitant to start reading, since I was a bit disappointed by &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns.&#34; At times it felt slow because Hosseini builds each character so that they seam real. This is well worth your time.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was an adventure I was willing to take. The beginning was slow and I didn't see what all the talk was until Bam I was in a world I knew existed but not heard this much about, then it takes a twist and both characters are in the unknown. The stories are compelling and very gripping. A must read for romance lovers. Awesome use of obtuse wording and extinct language not used in today's society. Loved it all!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it...borrowed it , read it once...bought it...read it again...and then again. A book that's very easy to lose yourself in.
0596007124|5.0|Best novice and medium start guide design patterns made fun!<br />Recommended to any developer/architect/system designer who wants to improve his/her applications. A must have book!
0062080237|3.0|I've read, oh, four or so of Gaiman's works, and they've been marvelous, \\"Neverwhere\\" being the first and second and third; and then.... but they are not this particular book, which is not the same, not even in the same ball park, nor solar system.  Granted, Gaiman's approach to death and \\"reality\\" has always been disquieting (for this Christian reviewer), but this creation is unduly strange.  \\"Unduly\\" because it never seems to go anywhere, plot-wise, story-telling-wise, alternate-universe-wise; maybe it goes neverwhere.  The characters never engaged me -- late in life I reread Time Enough For Love and still sort of liked Lazarus, even if his philosophy no longer accorded with mine -- but what's-his-name never fit at my dinner table.  Verbal legerdemain: Gaiman can indeed write well: it's fun to read his words, even if the story goes in circles like a merry-go-'round.  And I will never look at Lucy with quite the same eyes.  I will not re-read this one.
0399226907|5.0|We first feel in love with the regular hard cover version of this classic. The story has bright colors, fun sensory holes for tiny fingers to explore, simple plot lesson on metamorpheses, counting, days of the week, nutrition moral and food identification. It's been a family favorite. I wanted to give some new moms this book as a gift (with cute stuffed caterpillars I found at Dollar Tree). I knew I'd find the best deal for the book on Amazon.com, so I took a risk ordering this smaller copy. It is small (slightly bigger than a dollar bill), but perfectly appropriate for the baby/toddler audience! It can become that special book that travels to the car, pack n play or fits in your purse for an errand. This is a satisfying purchase for my gift.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|It took me awhile to get used to the Doctor not being played by David Tennant, but Matt Smith is superb!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was amazing but if you read the book and watch the movie you are in for a suprise
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I just love this story. The old days, the etiquette, the love... And Richard Armitage. Hello! What a man! Yes please...
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Never any issues on any device I've played on. Great graphics, overall very fun game for all ages. Love that you can accessorize your shark w a lot of variety.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down just like the first one.  I just reread the book since the movie is coming out soon and it was just as good the second time around.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app was very fun. We made a family night of it and everyone enjoyed finding the clues and figuring out what to do with them. Can't wait for more rooms.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Been watching from the very beginning excellent entertainment. Always wondering who will survive, or who will be next!! Looking forward to new season in October.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I know some people that claim to be \\"Star Trek fans\\" will tell you this movie is a disgrace to the franchise.  I am here to tell you that I am a HUGE Star Trek fan and I found this movie to be very good.  I realize Abrams has changed the universe, but that is what makes this so interesting. We all watched the original series, the next generation, voyager... etc.  Rather than relive the past over and over and over again, what we have is something new.  We have a franchise that is decades old and still relevant today.  That is what makes these movies so refreshing.  The fact that they aren't predictable and feel NEW!<br /><br />For those non-Star Trek fans, you will love the movie.  It is very fast paced.  There is humor (maybe a bit too much).  There is a bad guy.  There is suspence.  There is GREAT Writing and a great story.  And more importantly, these actors have done a fabulous job working together and you can feel the chemistry like you did in all the Star Trek series.  Even if you are not a trekie, this is a great fun movie to watch.<br /><br />William Shatner once blasted the Next Generation when it was coming out on TV.  He said the Trek fans would never accept the new series.  He was wrong.  Just like how the Trek fans are wrong about these movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just reread Catching Fire and then had to reread Mockingjay as well.  The first time I read it I liked it but I didn't love it, the second time I read it I loved it.  Suzanne writes so well and even though I had already read it I couldn't put it down.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|A very good price for a well made product. Just as it was shown and described on the Amazon site.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Best book I've read in a while.  Confusing in the beginning, but as all of the intersecting lives begin to deepen and you learn the characters, it grabs you and pulls you in.  Loved it.
B003WUYQSW|4.0|Before the Internet Gary would probably have been the greatest shoe salesman if that was the direction he went.  He'd be a winner wherever he tried.  But in the Internet  age things are unfolding so rapidly it takes a great current-time thinker to help normal folks put the pieces together and that's what he does so expertly.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Well acted, good action and I was on the edge of my seat. Brad Pitt was masterful, rock solid and believable.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it, Just plugged it into TV, Following instructions, Have no problem, simple to use.  I would have like to have had a little more info on the device.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|This CD is an eclectic mix of songs. I particularly like the song where he sampled from Billie Holiday! I just love it!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|While there can't be a definitive single CD of Beatles' music, this is a very good collection.  Highly recommend it.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|It's an excellent addition to my Blu Ray Collection. Will buy again from here. Great Series to watch. Walking Dead Rules!!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I must admit.  This second book was much better.  Now that Christian is cured, Ana needs therapy.  This woman is too jealous.  I think she has issues that need to be discussed with Dr. Flynn.  Christian is so sweet with the words he says to Ana.  I nearly melt when he speaks from the heart.  Still too much cussing.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Fantastic read. Makes you stop and appreciate the little things. Loved it!! Would recommend this book to anyone!  Thanks Mom for telling me about it
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|Pretentious. This movie tries so hard to be intense, brooding & deep but fails to deliver. No wonder it went straight to DVD. It would have bombed in general release.  Such a disappointment. Don't waste your time or money on this snooze fest.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|It's an excellent addition to my Blu Ray Collection. Will buy again from here. Great Series to watch. Game of Thrones Rules!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|\\"I absolutely loved this book, it's heart breaking yet suspenseful, there are so many surprises it's almost unbearable. I read it in three days because it was so good.\\"
1609611543|4.0|I would give this a five star rating for content but the only complaint I have is perhaps it gets a little long winded and technical. A little better editing could have easily resolved this. Other than that, the information it contains gives the reader some potential avenues to explore that are not so mainstream. The central theme of the book addresses the effects simple carbs have on us and the problems we encounter sometimes due to the GMO aspect of most of the grains available for us to eat. Some commenters here have criticized him for being anecdotal to substantiate his claims but I don't think that label truly fits. He is a doctor who has successfully treated MANY patients with various ailments who have been to other doctors and used the medicines prescribed to no avail. He provides evidence from those cases yet people cast him as being anecdotal as if he only heard of someone's sister's mother's brother's nephew's son being cured by a witch doctor back in the early 60's in some remote village on the other side of the planet. Of course I use hyperbole, but only because I view their claims as such. What more can a doctor do than provide first-hand accounts of before and after real cases? Others have acted like it's not necessary to buy this book because the information is simple and easily available. It is true the information is simple and easily available but many people need to read it from a trusted doctor and they need to be inspired that they MAY have other options to treat their particular ailments even after years of failure with medicine-based approaches. This book is like many others and substantiates a truth that many illnesses can be dealt with successfully through a change in diet and/or lifestyle. When my wife and I see a commercial for some type of medicine, we always joke that the side-effects seem worse than the symptoms they are intended to treat. what does that mean? It means while the medicine is masking the symptoms (never actually curing them because they can't), it is actually causing harm to your body in other ways. Many times a doctor has to prescribe several medications that counteract the other's side-effects. So these are the physical train-wrecks he has seen walk in his office time and time again and he has introduced them to the concepts he lays out in his book and has seen great results evidenced by those patients being able to get off the medications and start feeling better. And that is what this doctor is all about
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I like playing this game but my granddaughter loves it, & it gives her something to do while her big brother hogs th TV in the family room.
030758836X|5.0|This was a perfectly drawn story of two people who meet, fall in love and never really know one another.  The ending leaves you believing there is more to the story.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app very much. I am a new user to being online and being able to access the weather is one of the many things I like. I would like to be able to find out about the tides, also. So I can plan when to go to the beach.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|It feels like a book. It also stands horizontally when I want that aspect. I like the red color because it is easily seen.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking.  History illuminated at everyman's level.  Fleshes out world events at the human level.  A must read.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Sharp Objects is a read-it-now thriller that should have you turning the pages in your quest to unravel the whodunit mystery. It's Gillian Flynn's first, and her development as an author is clearly evident if you read her next two books, I'm glad I began with Gone Girl. The story revolves around Camille who has more than a few personality problems--caused, supposedly, by maternal lack of affection. She is a reporter on a little-read newspaper who is sent back to her home town to glean a high profile story on child murders. The story is well written and the character is likable despite her hang ups. I did not find the relationship between the sisters as portrayed by the author believable. The chief protagonist is in her thirties and she socialites in an illegal manner with her thirteen-year-old sister? Hey.... but it's fiction, right? So read it to get a novel spin on a family saga that is more than a little twisted and certainly interesting.
B00C5R8364|4.0|As I wrote in the title. This book is a good read. It is entertaining, and gives a good political description of the world today.<br /><br />It is not a Clive Cussler or a Carolyn McCray novel, but I liked it.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Other than the high price tag, this is a fairly decent point and click adventure game. But, if you like Hidden Object Scenes, you'll find none here. The game play, I found to be a tad \\"slow\\" and lacking in the \\"adrenalin\\" department. Although, the story was different compared to the usual ghosts, witches, demons and mental hospital escapees that we're used to seeing in games such as this, it still was suspenseful enough that it was enjoyable to play.<br /><br />I am unsure if G5 has made any minor changes and/or updates recently;  but I personally have not experienced any of the issues a few reviewers had mentioned in their comments. Because I haven't had this issue, I assumed developers had the nag screen removed from the app. However, I'd be curious to know if others are still being nagged to rate the game with a 5 star review after each chapter.<br /><br />I've played longer games for much less money and lately, the quality of G5's games, simply does not always warrant the price tag of $4.99. Where Angels Cry is a nice game but I personally don't feel it's worth the full asking price.
031623480X|5.0|As a healthcare provider, I have been sharing the key points of this book with all of my patients. I have only eaten bread once since starting this book, and that was a mistake! Otherwise, I feel much sharper mentally than I have in a long time. I've also effortlessly lost 12 pounds in three weeks and gained control over my appetite. If you don't believe the incredible ability of insulin to control your eating behavior, you can learn this once and for all by following the low-carb, gluten-free advice in this book for about a week, then expose yourself to a high-carb, bread-heavy meal and pay attention to what it does, not only to your appetite, but to your emotions in general. This happened with me, and it taught me once and for all that I don't want to allow carbs to literally control my behavior!<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter, having treated neurological diseases and disorders for years, tells of personal, professional stories of recovery that are simply amazing, all brought about by removing gluten from patients' diets. ADHD, Migraines, and Alzheimer's, are all known now by compelling research to be largely resultant from grain in the diet! Dr. Perlmutter points out that while you may not have obvious intestinal issues from having gluten in your diet, virtually ALL human beings have BRAIN sensitivity to gluten. Dr. Perlmutter talks about how the always-wrong advice of eating low-fat, high-carb meals robs your brain of much-needed cholesterol. He also talks about the link between statin drugs and Alzheimer's Disease. You'll also find information on other important weight- and appetite-regulating hormones, such as Ghrelin and Leptin.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter includes numerous recipes and a four-week plan to help you get off to a great start on a permanent life change by focusing on single things each of the first three weeks, and then bringing it all together in Week 4. Week 1 - Focus on food, Week 2 - Focus on exercise, Week 3 - Focus on sleep, and Week 4 - Putting it all together (which includes great coaching tips on how NOT to stumble in your new lifestyle).<br /><br />With virtually every page, I thought constantly of an 83-year-old lady that I'm close to that has Alzheimer's Disease, and how her life was filled with doing all of the things warned against in this book: low-fat, high-carb, taking statins (and every other kind of pill ever recommended by her doctor). Now, she costs her family and society a fortune every month, as well as exhausting and grieving her loved ones with her plight and their helplessness in the situation. I was impressed that Dr. Perlmutter gave many examples of how drugs were NOT the answer to many mental issues, and how often, in a very short time, a dietary difference can make all the difference!<br /><br />Tired of being foggy and fat? Read this book! It will change your life!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone Great and fun game easy to pick up on<br />If your into action packed and all around fun games to play this is it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the last installment. Got pretty crazy there at the end. Wonder how well they're going to follow the book in the movie.
0439813786|4.0|Upon first picking up the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick I was completely overwhelmed by the thickness of what is listed as a children's book. Now don't get me wrong, I read the entire Harry Potter series but those books were written for a slightly older audience so the length seemed more manageable. I told myself I would start by reading just the first 100 pages so I could break up the long text. Much to my surprise the first approximately 40 pages of the book are drawings, beautiful detailed yet simple graphite sketches that tell the story of a young boy in Paris who lives a life of mystery inside a train station. As the text started I expected to reread what I was just shown in pictures but the author continues on the story where the last picture left off. This continues to happen throughout the book and as a twenty-something year old woman I found myself enjoying that I could make up my own stories to the pictures between Selznick's writing. While I wish at times Selznick would go into more detail about Hugo's, the main character, life, the functions of the clocks, the mechanical man and the old man's previous life I had to remind myself this book was written for children ages eight and above. I finished the entire book in a two hour period and while I don't think many people above the age of 13 will seek out this book on their own the story was enjoyable and I can see it as a perfect book for elementary and middle school children.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|the product is very versatile: you can plug this little amp to 3.5 audio jag (most of headphones jag), to digital audio, USB and iphone/ipod jag (old ones though); this give you lots of options. It sures amplify big headphones  ( I have an audiothenica m30) more than any portable player can do, but in my experience this amp dont increase much the sound quality. I tried with my flac quality songs, evethough it makes a diference it is not as I expected.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Not really worth the money!<br />I wouldn't spend the money again especially after finding out the application doesn't have music to download and use unless you spend more money.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|the movie rambled on and on. like an old road. my wife and I were bored and very disappointed confused with the plot.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is an addictive org that is worth the time. Only down side is the pay portion and long wait times for upgrading your equipment.
0691131511|4.0|I really have to take my hat off to the author. Although the book is not a chronological history, which I probably would have preferred, it presents brilliantly composed snapshots organized by topics, such as chapters on eunuchs, Greek fire, economics, etc. This is an amazing book, and it  very challenging, written skillfully at the highest levels .After reading it I feel compelled to immediately reread select chapters. The author has written a truly magnificent book full of subtlety, irony, and meaning. I thank her, it's a must read.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|Not much more to it. It's heavy, durable, beautiful, and does it's job. Comes with an extension cord if the 2ft-ish cord is too small for you. The bottom of the controller is a clear gum-type of material (think of shoes that have the gum bottoms) that 'sticks' to most surfaces. It is also somewhat clear, and has a blue led that shoots down, creating a glowing blue ring that is really really slick.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|Its a cute game,  I haven't resorted to buying the full version, and my son only seems to want to play the ones he can't.  Not sure why I haven't may have been the price for putting puzzles together.  I will look into it again soon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game. Very addictive and cannot wait for more levels. Look out for secret passages. Thus game is a must have for all ages.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Given that this book is free on Kindle I downloaded it and gave it a read.<br /><br />My primary concern with the book is that the kid in this book doesn't try to do anything, but is given everything he wants instantly. He tries one time, success. This is true through the whole book. He has everything given to him just by pure luck. He doesn't put in any hard work at all. This is the kind of story that teaches kids that they don't have to try and they are all special and will go on to live an amazing life without doing anything.  You have to put in hard work and effort to become successful.<br /><br />Beyond this, the book is geared toward young readers, maybe early teens?  I didn't notice any particular issues with the vocabulary or sentence structure other reviews have pointed out, but it's certainly not Tolkein writing the book.<br /><br />If you're bored and get it free on Kindle give it a read. I wouldn't pay for it though.
B008K8U13K|2.0|why is this the prototype version of the game, the one where all music and sound effects are screwed up. plus sonic can't run at full speed and the controls are terrible, uninstalling!
B009LDD590|5.0|Not a fan of cable television these days, so I prefer to order my favorites and watch an entire season in one week.  This season DID NOT DISAPPOINT.  I love you Nucky Thompson but this season was all Gyp Rosetti.  I enjoyed all twelve episodes and will leave it at that...don't want to reveal any of the good stuff.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is so fun!!! I can't believe it's free because if it wasn't free I would still get it. It's worth it. So I think you should get this game. Trust me you would be surprised how good this game is!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1451697686|5.0|The book came immediately.  It is a great book.  Wonderful resources and ideas.  A great motivator to get rid of stuff, live more simply, and reduce what comes in and what goes out of your home.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Nothing too deep here, just a fun read over a couple of days. This is your regular Dan Brown novel. I liked Inferno better.
B007SGM084|4.0|Kept me reading through the first two books.... I couldn't put it down!  The story could've ended there. The third book has some slow spots and becomes very predictable. It seems to end and then has afterthought which follows. It feels awkward to me but overall a very good read.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy playing this game but I feel some aspects are too expensive and time consuming to be rational<br /> in a GAME. Acorns are hard to come by, and don't tell me to play the Scrat game because I feel the rewards scale is rigged.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't stop reading!!!!!!! So amazing. This is a book you want to cry and be happy over. So well written.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|It moved at all times no time to relax and look behind as you read  you just want<br /> to get to the next event and find the bad guys and what it is all about. No time to waste  it just keeps you wanting more.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|What a wonderful find. i was looking for an easy to use calendar for my kindle fire.<br />Works great and I would recommend this to anyone.
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|Boring and un suspenseful. Overrated bye everyone. Hate how people say this movie was so good?! It was crap and the military scenes sucked.
B005LAII80|5.0|A superb urban sci-fi action movie that spares no time getting you right to the action. The actors' performances and the direction are both excellent. Although this movie is lacking in much social commentary or satire, it would make a great double-feature with Robocop. Dredd is more straight-forward survival adrenaline like Die Hard or The Raid although it's a bit deeper than either.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Terrific!<br /><br />OK, I can't submit this with just one word, even if it's the right word.  It works well and it sets up easily.  I am buying two more right now. One as a gift and the other for my other TV.  Netflix and YouTube work far better with this than with the TV's built-in browser.  I'll say it again - terrific!
B000XUBC5E|5.0|I have read it twice. It is a really fast read because it is written and edited so well. Buy it!
B004FHP9KA|4.0|this was a good movie to rent, however, I don't see why there was SOOO much hype! It's not going to be one a watch over and over again.
B009JBZH54|5.0|These movies are awesome to watch. This new batman is better than the older version. The price is very cheap.
B0000AUHPK|4.0|I've always loved this story albeit dark, but Ralph Fiennes is dreamy enough to make you love the villain. If you're a fan of Old England, try this one.
B00E95ED32|5.0|Top Three Songs:<br />- Wake Me Up (feat. Aloe Blacc)<br />- Shame on Me (feat. Audra Mae, Sterling Fox, & Nile Rodgers)<br />- Lay Me Down (feat. Adam Lambert & Nile Rodgers)<br /><br />  I thought I saw it all when I heard of the metal band Korn working with artists like Kill the Noise, Skrillex, and Noisa to make The Path of Totality (2011), a mix of metal and dubstep (or whatever you experts want to call it).Well I was wrong because here comes house producer, Avicii, with this first studio album True (2013) mixing a genre that I thought I would never hear mixed with EDM (at least too well with); country. We got a taste of this country/EDM mix back in Ultra Music Festival in 2013 when he played an acoustic set with some of the artists of the album. It got really mixed reviews with the fans, they were at first confused with the new set and sound that they were hearing, but later on Avicii was praised for experimenting with country music along with other genres. And to say the least that he isn't just experimenting with country music like everyone thinks, he also was able to throw in some pop, disco, R&B, soul, rock, and funk with his own house sound. So now comes the question: Is the album a hit or a failure?<br /><br /> Of course we start off with the first single of the album \\"Wake Me Up\\" with Aloe Blacc providing outstanding vocals and inspiring lyrics. This is one of the songs that follow that country sound with its square-dancing like beats and guitar along with a synth you can tell that Avicii clearly made. \\"You Make Me\\" is a more soul/pop like song, with a piano that stands out and vocals from Salem Al Fakir that also makes the song. Another song that follows the country/American theme is \\"Oh Brother\\" with lyrics, from Roger Pontare, that are clearly magical and have deep meaning with each verse along with a trumpet that makes you want to get up and just dance, again, a square-dancing like tempo. The next song almost sounds like an Adele song, with the soul/R&B vocals from Audra Mae keeping it very calm and not making upbeat, a good song just to listen too. \\"Dear Boy\\" is one of two songs that feel only like an Avicii house song without any outside genres in it. I am not a big fan of the lead synth at most times it just annoys me, I can withstand it, but I won't be playing it like the other songs. With Blondfire and Aloe Blacc providing vocals another country/folk like song, this song again is more relaxing that you can just listen to without needing to get up to dance and also has a classic keyboard-like synth with it which is nice change. We get to two songs that I feel like they were cut from Daft Punk's new album Random Access Memories (2013), but they shouldn't have. \\"Shame on Me\\" is really an up-beat R&B/soul song that I almost challenge you to resist not dancing to its drum beat that gets you up on your feet, vocals that are amazing, and a Daft Punk like vocoder that stands out and makes this song. The next song is a disco/funk song, again just amazing and I want to challenge you to not dance. \\"Lay Me Down\\" is what I expected from Random Access Memories; great grove, a guitar funk from Nile Rodgers, and vocals from Adam Lambert that just take you back to the 70's. \\"Hope There's Someone\\" is a cover song from a band called \\"Antony and the Johnsons\\" that was released in 2005 (if you think that isn't long that was 8 years ago). Avicii did a great job recreating this song, but making it a house song, instead of \\"Baroque pop\\" style of song, with vocals by Linnea Henriksson. The ending song of this album, \\"Heart Upon My Sleeve,\\" is the only instrumental track in the album with the orchestral strings that just power this track up to the next level, a great end to a great album.<br /><br />  To say the least this is album did not a fail at all, it was an overall success, even though Avicii did take a huge chance with trying mix genres, it all paid off.  Not only did he do a fantastic job at merging all these different genres with his own house sound, he did it right were other artists might fail. I said with \\"Shame on Me\\" and \\"Lay Me Down\\" those were songs which I think should have been on the last Daft Punk album because they just fit that disco and funk they were messing around with, but lacked that up-beat dance you would hear at that time period on that album. Avicii also did a great job messing with country rhythms and instruments that made this album so great too, not just making danceable songs, like \\"Wake Me Up\\", but songs like \\"Hey Brother\\" which just carried so much emotion in it. He also had songs that you could just listen too without the need to dance, which a lot of artists with albums fail to do, like \\"Addicted to You\\" and \\"Lair Lair\\" where the main focus was the vocals and the instruments have more of a back-up role. There was only one song that I could not listen to too much and that was \\"Dear Boy\\". The vocals were good and it felt very much of an Avicii like song, but the lead synth in it I just can't stand to listen to it for 7 minutes basically. But for Avicii's first studio album he did fantastic. He had the right mixture of his style and other genres that I thought would never work out for an EDM artist really. This is a must have for any EDM fan.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My husband bought me a kindle fire and I was looking for some free games to download. I saw this and thought I would like it because I like puzzles. The instructions were confusing and I actually had to look up a tutorial online to get it. But now I do and I am on level 5. It's frustrating but so addicting. Looks like I found something to do to waste time!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie is good to watch after watching the Lord of the Ring trilogy. I can't wait to see part 2 of the Hobbit.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I don't know how many times I've watched this movie, but it never seems to get old. Emily Blunt is perfection! This is a must-see for anyone who loves historical romance.
B00F35BV64|3.0|the movie had a descent story and some pretty awesome action scenes. My only reason for not rating it higher is it was too predictable. All in all it was good but a bit of a let down from the first movie.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a super fun and cool game. I played for the first time and loved it! My brother wanted me to get the game because his friend had it. I would recommend to kids who are 6 and up. This game is definitely something to download!
B0026NZR98|5.0|wish I watch this earlier or on release, so I could talk to people about it.<br />I had a school project due on this movie and I count find in stores.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|My husband saw this band on one of the late night shows and played the song for me (Pompeii), it was love at first listen!  Ordered the album the next day from Amazon and every song is wonderful:  beautiful instrumentals, great singing.  Reminds me of a mix of Depeche Mode, Morrissey and Coldplay.  The only bad thing is that I get the songs stuck in my head and can't stop hearing them!  Already anxiously awaiting some new music from them, may even purchase the US release for the two extra bonus tracks!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This one definitely was the best of the three. The only thing it lacked was a conclusion on the Jack Hyde fiasco. Talk about leaving a reader hanging! I would have loved fifty more pages to read about the conclusion on this; especially because it took up such a huge part of the book!<br /><br />I loved everything else in this book. I'm happy that the author chilled out on the \\"inner goddess\\" references and the thin lip references.<br /><br />Such a fun read & a fun series, overall. Wish it didn't end! I hope she writes another novel about their family life.
0307456633|5.0|sad there was only one season.  too bad no one enjoys descent shows.  now I need to read but cannot afford it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this book! My whole school is reading it. No matter what this will always be my favorite book ever!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Love the sound options and alarm settings. only problem I had was with the last update it would shut off every 45 min for some reason waking me up
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I enjoyed all three of these books. BUT. The phrases got redundant. Christian's mouth in a \\"thin line; thin angry line; thin sad line.\\" The \\"inner goddess\\" in Ana has got to go, as well as, the \\"half moon glasses\\" that she peers over.<br /><br />Entertaining? Yes. Repetition of phrases throughout all three of these books? Annoying. Too much sex- even the sex gets boring.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Edit: 9/17/13<br /><br />Unfortunately I had to return it. (Lowered my rating from 3 to 1 star). Even though it was working last night after 4+ hours of trying. I woke up this morning and it was not working again. The router is 5 feet away from it. It is unreliable and cannot always connect to the internet. FYI, I am pretty familiar with networks and I'm not a novice. This thing is not ready for prime time.<br /><br />9/16/13<br /><br />I spent several hours trying to make the Chromecast work with my network. Chromecast has compatibility issues with several routers. This thing was driving me crazy! I was able to connect it to my network but not the internet.<br /><br />You need to go to Google support here: [...] and check known issues with several routers and workarounds.<br /><br />My router is the Netgear R6300, and In my case, I had to enable ipv6 in the router. (it is disabled by default)<br /><br />I noticed that many people were having similar issue; so I hope this resolves your connectivity problems and help keep your blood pressure down.
B004S5C8WG|3.0|This a good book for a rainy day, an intriguing plot, some good surprises, and easy to read.<br />Recommended for those of us who enjoy almost credible  fiction.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|I love, love, love this movie. So many great actors and a great story to boot.  I highly recommend it.<br />The sequel now out in theaters is good but can't com[are to the repeated viewings this one makes so enjoyable.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie stayed very true to the comic books, and brought a visceral and real world to the big screen. The action was believable and the story was very solid. All the actors involved superbly played their parts, and their keen performances made this film a veritable hit. This movie has personally earned a rank in my favorites collection, and I highly recommend it to any lover of action and/or the comic book genre. You will not be disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|5+ stars. I absolutely love this book trilogy. I fell in love instantly with Christian and Ana. Alot of people call it mommy porn but it's a deeply moving love story between two completely different people. I have to say the third book is my favorite. I recommend all three books as a must read.  The Love between Christian and Ana is so beautiful. We see it begin and bloom into a love that is unconditional. Thank you to EL James for a  beautiful story that I have enjoyed reading over and over again.
B0061S073A|5.0|This app works to beef up the parental controls on my original Kindle Fire.  I wish it were available on the Kindle Fire HD, but it's not for some reason.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|This is the Dead at their peak. The Dark Star and Playin In The Band could rank among the best ever live renditions. Also a stellar Bird Song and Greatest Story Ever Told. U can't go wrong with the Dead, Jack! As for the DVD, it is only rivalled by The Grateful Dead Movie as far as the most killer GD performance captured on video (although, technically, the GD movie is compiled from a multi-night run @ Winterland)BTW, what was up with that naked dude on the stage?
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I love all the details to this app. I hate that it is 99&cent; to upgrade it. The main thing is I love this app!!!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|If you're a &#34;trekkie&#34;, you'll really love this movie, especially if you followed the older TV series.  Without giving everything away, you should watch &#34;The Wrath of Kahn&#34; old movie before watching this.  Your understanding of the references will enhance your movie experience, if you do.  As always, JJ Abrams does a wonderful job directing.  Next time, you can cut down on the &#34;glare&#34; effects, JJ, and you are the wizard at camera shaking.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Loved Robert Redford in the Great Gatsby.  The 2013 version was beautiful and flashy but the 1974 verson with R. Redford can't be beat.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is an interesting view into what could possibly happen in the future or in another civilization.  Very entertaining but basically sad with people hunting one another.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|The actors are good, but the storyline seems to be quite predictable.<br />I still enjoyed the show very much.<br />I especially like the drones - they appear very fierce with the sound effects and their forceful actions.
B004LROUNG|5.0|One of the best Grisham books I've read. Kept you guessing and had interesting twists. I would it read again.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|i liked this movie better than Fast & Furious 6 and Ironman 3 which came out around the same time.
B0030B621W|5.0|Sam Bell is serving out a 3 year contract on a lunar mining base.. or at least, that's what he's made to think.<br /><br />This movie is a thinking person's film.  If you're looking for explosions or aliens, this probably isn't your movie.<br /><br />I absolutely cannot spoil this movie for you, so I can't say too much.  It's got elements of Momento and Total Recall, but it's much more personal, intimate, sober and reflective.<br /><br />An excellent independent film that transcends science fiction.  Like \\"the Matrix\\", there may be a parable about our current lives... hidden in this movie.<br /><br />The ending is a bit drawn out, but the acting, writing and story are superb for my taste.
B00BOXZAG6|2.0|Idea is creative, but didn't expect it to be a love story.  Would have been better if it can leverage on its interesting idea on something more action-pack (IMO).<br />Video quality is poor for a Blu-ray disk.  Video is snowy and pixelated at times.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I am new to Montezuma and was not sure about this timed game,but have gotten somewhat addicted to the game. I find myself stopping when reading and thinking that I will fit in a quick game and half an hour later I am still playing!  So toe this has become a great game and as I get older I find  that this game exercises my mind and increases my dexterity. I hope that you find this game pleasurable as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Has many challenges on each floor to find an escape. I enjoyed the challenges and puzzles on each floor and the many views
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE TO PLAY THIS GAME but it is hard to beat Victor it is fun and funny I think that you should get this app
B009MO5ES8|4.0|Surprisingly fast pace movie.  Storyline a bit too simple though.<br />But I really cannot imagine riding a bicycle without brakes...
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Well written novel that tells the story, probably all too commonplace, of women trying to survive a constantly changing set of rules in Afghanistan. While not as emotional as kite runner, the author keeps you engaged throughout and brings Afghanistan to you from the eyes of women and children.  A good read
B000005RU2|5.0|I'm a Mini LP CD collector. AKA Paper Sleeve cd. While searching I ran across Made In Japan and looked at pictures since some remasters are released in the Mini LP format. I scanned the reviews and had hoped to come across some mentioning of the packaging. The cd is going to sound different to each person so I don't bother with that part of reviews. The images shown about item ARE NOT the cd that you receive. I purchased with that assumption and requested to return product. If you are a collector of the MINI LP CD format best to inquire before purchase.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I was prepared for a tale of a drill sergeant mother, of a headstrong, unrelenting parent whom I would violently disagree with.<br /><br />Not So!<br /><br />I found the book inspiring in its emphasis on raising bright, accomplished, kids.  After years of helicopter parenting, it is refreshing to be reminded that parents do set the tone and standards. Maybe if we had more kids raised a bit more no nonsense, our society would be better off.<br /><br />That said, everything in moderation, as the author discovers by the book's end.<br />Highly recommended for an excellent, quick read.,
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Storyline is ok, and the actors are not bad.<br />But the video quality is very poor for a Blu-ray disc.  I thought is its either my Blu-ray player, AV receiver or TV causing the problem.  But a check on my Avatar 3D disc indicate otherwise.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This was full of action and I like the new technology and how it very updated the old Star Trek. The actors are great and I though the movie was great!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is terrific; no freezing or crashing. I got this app because the weather channel app kept crashing. very happy with this, easy to navigate &amp; updates are instant!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! Not only do I play it but so do my kids. It keeps us entertained for hours!!!

B005XQLBU4|4.0|missile defender is one of the most addicting games on kinndle ive ever seen. Never have seen another game with so much Multics tasking
B002M9WW30|5.0|I almost brought this last week for 35.00 (a used copy) but I didn't. I'm glad I didn't because a few days later I brought it on here for only 19.95 (brand new) so thank you Amazon for the great deal.<br />Up here and all over the internet i've seen people give this set bad reviews for it's picture quality so I was expecting the worse. But after watching them i have to wonder what is wrong with those people. This is the best I have ever seen these films look. Yes, the picture quality could have been better, but I am completely satisfied. So if you love the ROCKY movies go ahead and get this set.
0307719774|5.0|I absolutely love this book! I find it to be a unique way to see the changes that you went through throughout the years. Extremely pretty and gorgeous. It's also quite small so it'd be portable.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|It's great movie i like it and even the quality is very good. i will recommend you to sign on amazon prime.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|This series just increasingly becomes better; this is my favorite series, and I am always satisfied with each season I purchase.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I'm going to make this short and sweet: if you love Titanic and have a blu ray player you HAVE to add this movie to your collection. The picture is the best I have ever seen it look. The audio quality is out of this world. Get it now!!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not something I thought I would be interested in but once you start playing its super addictive... Love the challenge of it definitely keeps your mind going!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Fast moving and very suspenseful and sometimes even scary. This was my very first book that I read by Lee Child. I will definitely read No. 2 &#34;Die Trying&#34;.
B00F35BV64|4.0|If you are a Star Trek Enthusiast, then this one is for you! Some very interesting spots during the movie that will have you saying &#34;I remember that!&#34;. I won't go any further, other than to say you'll see.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Purchased for my other half for his birthday. Recieved today. Tried to use digital copy code as our son accidently broke our dvd player. Keep being told the code is invalid. Hubby is off to purchase another dvd player so we can watch. I had thought we would be able to view via Amazon Instant Video once itbbecame available with tjis purchase. Apparently I was wrong. You have to view through Paramount and they replied that it may take up to 72 hours to process our issue and reply. Very aggravated and disappointed. If we ever get to watch the movie, I will reevaluate my rating
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|IT'S OK BUTT IT ONLY WORKS WITH GOOGLE AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE WI-FI. THIS IS GOOD IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SMART TV OR A DVD PLAYER WITH WI-FI THEN IT'S COOL. MAYBE SINCE IT'S NEW THEY WILL COME OUT WITH A LOT MORE IT CAN DO..LIKE I SAID IT'S OK ...

B000AYEL6U|4.0|Mrs Gaskell's novel deals with a young woman who moves from rural Helstone in the south of England to Milton, a gritty industrial town in the north. Her father refuses to sign the bishop's declaration of conformity with the Common Book of Prayer, thus making him a dissenter. As a result, he loses his position in the church and moves the family lock, stock and barrel to Milton, far enough away, he thinks, to make his disgrace a secret. There, they live on his wife's meager income while he ineffectively tries to make money giving \\"lectures\\" and taking private pupils. In this booming industrial town, an Oxford education is a rarity. One of his pupils is Mr. Thornton, owner of a thriving cotton mill. Mr. Thorton is a self-made man, intelligent but not educated.<br /><br />The daughter, Margaret, is first repulsed, then attracted to Mr. Thornton (very like Pride & Prejudice.) A series of reversals and sudden deaths changes the fortune of both Margaret and Thornton.<br /><br />The problem with Gaskell's writing is that it is less skillful than Bronte or even Dickens. She has a good eye for the milieu but uses a broad brush and her novelistic machinations are rather jarringly unlikely--or handled less skillfully than the same \\"unlikely\\" occurrences would be by Bronte or Dickens. But the drama makes for a good miniseries, and the script is quite faithful to the book, except the initial chapters where Mr. Hale pretty much destroys his family is played down a lot. This is in my opinion Mrs Gaskell's best novel and it was a good read--and it makes a good dramatic series. However, Wives and Daughters, a weaker book, made for a better series, in my opinion.
B00E3UN44W|5.0|I'm a '60s kid, and much too old for fangirling, even if I was the right sex, but I'm addicted to the show as much as the fangirls are (though I draw the line at \\"shipping\\"). Heck, though, Sherlock is testing my stamina as well as my hearing. Benedict Cumberbatch talks at roughly the speed computer chips used to go in the days before computer chips started going at the speed of light. Which is difficult enough for a brain like mine that only goes at the speed of clockwork, but on top of that you have the visual graffiti, those fly-past word-jumbles that litter the screen like a hallucinogenic Scrabble game every time some new character attracts Sherlock's gaze. It makes for an information-flow that is more than my cerebral cortex can process without overloading the circuits and causing smoke to leak from my ears.<br /><br />Still, there's always the good old BBC iPlayer where you can re-play the show at your leisure. I've seen two episodes so far, and careful analysis of the content tells me that Sherlock is still alive and Moriarty is still dead. That's about all I can say for a certainty, because in terms of comprehension I'm struggling along at the back of the pack.<br /><br />But certainty is not something you should look for in any case from Sherlock, which specializes in teasing the viewer. Steven Moffat is just one of three writers for the series, but it is his presence that is most strongly felt, even in episodes he didn't write. In many ways the psychology of the show occupies the same territory as Moffat's other show, Doctor Who, where comedy and drama can alternate several times within the space of a minute, and false scents and long-delayed payoffs are part of a strategy that seems increasingly audience-aware. In Episode 1, The Empty Hearse, Moffat goes as far as lampooning his own fans, or the hard-core at least, by dramatizing no less than three different solutions to Sherlock's faked death based on theories circulating on the internet since the Reichenbach Fall episode that seemingly killed him off (and then seemingly didn't). It's gone further than any show has before in breaking the \\"fourth wall\\", and is edging dangerously close to what would probably be called Deconstructionist drama, where the distinction between actors and audience is dissolved entirely, and where fictional structure falls into a Perception Paradox and implodes with a gentle sigh. No, I'm joking (I think).<br /><br />But say what you like about Moffat (and many bad things have been said), he's never boring. If this remarkable show is going to vanish down its own plughole, I'd like to be there to see it happen. In the meantime, here are some good reasons to keep watching:<br /><br />Martin Freeman as Dr Watson - surely the face-actor of all time. First seen as Tim Canterbury in The Office (UK original), Freeman can do more with a fleeting look than others can do with a whole paragraph of speech. There is a lunatic moment in Episode 2 (The Sign of Three) where, for no obvious reason, he calls Sherlock \\"mate\\". In the barely perceptible pause that follows, the merest flash of facial expression succeeds brilliantly in conveying his astonishment at himself for having used such a blokey form of address. It happens so fast that the inattentive viewer could easily miss it, but for me it was the funniest moment in an episode that contained a lot of funny moments. More than that, it reinforces the feeling I've always had that Freeman does not play Watson; Freeman *is* Watson. He is thinking and feeling everything that Watson is thinking and feeling, no acting required. A master-class.<br /><br />Una Stubbs as Mrs Hudson - often described in her native land as a \\"national treasure\\", which undervalues her. In my view, she's precious enough to deserve her own vault in the Bank of England with guards at the door 24/7. Older viewers will remember her in Worzel Gummidge playing opposite Jon Pertwee as Aunt Sally. (I mean she, not Jon Pertwee, was Aunt Sally.) Viewers even older than that will remember her as Rita in Till Death Us Do Part (US remake: All in the Family). Mrs Hudson, the good-hearted chatterbox, is not an easy part to play without becoming tiresome, but Stubbs hits exactly the right tone and is an essential ingredient in at least two great comic scenes.<br /><br />Look out for:<br />Lars Mikkelson as Charles Augustus Magnussen, who promises to be the new Moriarty. I say \\"look out for\\", because so far we've seen only his eyes, which might or might not be a conscious echo of the eyes-only view we had of the new Doctor (Peter Capaldi) in The Day of the Doctor. Undoubtedly cast on the strength of his impressive performance in the Danish series, Forbrydelsen (The Killing), he might be a sign of a change in mood. Up to now the present season has tended more towards the comic and self-referential. Mikkelsen's appearance might be the moment when the new season turns serious.<br /><br />Speculate about:<br />Mary Morstan, as played by Martin Freeman's real-life partner, Amanda Abbington. In Episode 2 she marries Watson, and Sherlock is best man. However, in the previous episode Sherlock had subjected her to his usual scrutiny at their first encounter, generating a screenful of the aforementioned word-jumbles: \\"linguist\\", \\"nurse\\", \\"short-sighted\\", \\"cat-lover\\", \\"bakes own bread\\", and several others. One that could easily be missed is \\"liar\\". Was that thrown in on a whim, or is it a time-bomb? Hmmm......<br /><br />That's my review. What follows below is something I posted back in September, when Amazon was offering the DVDs for Season 3 on pre-order. Which was absurdly premature, since not only had the season not been screened yet, it hadn't even been shot. We were being invited to review discs for a non-existent show. So, predictably, a lot of people took up the challenge. I couldn't resist making my own contribution, in the form of a Victorian fantasy. I should probably delete it now, since it's lost its topicality, but people seemed to like it, so I'll leave it be.<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />(Scene: 221b Baker St, London NW1. Date: April 1st, 1895)<br /><br />WATSON: Pray, Holmes, instead of puffing on that ridiculously large pipe and staring moodily out of the window, apprise me of the solution to the Case of the Missing Moving-Picture Show.<br /><br />HOLMES:  I'm cogitating, Watson.<br /><br />WATSON: Indeed? Well, let us hope Mrs Hudson doesn't enter unexpectedly.<br /><br />HOLMES:  You are very droll.<br /><br />WATSON: I confess, Holmes, that I grow vexed at your obfuscation. You speak mysteriously of products that are for sale, yet do not exist; which can be rated and ranked and judged for quality by their customers, yet the warehouses that supposedly store them are empty. You can buy them, but cannot hold them in your hands. You speak of dogs that didn't bark in the night, of cars that didn't park in the night, and ghosts that didn't give me a fright, but still I know no more than I did at the start.<br /><br />HOLMES:  Very well. I see that I have been remiss in not furnishing you with the fruits of my mental labours. Consider, Watson: once you have eliminated the absurd, whatever remains, however ludicrous, must be the total minus the former.<br /><br />WATSON: That's the latter.<br /><br />HOLMES: You have it precisely.<br /><br />WATSON: And what is it, in a nutshell?<br /><br />HOLMES: It's a nut, Watson, as any book on botany will reveal.<br /><br />WATSON: I mean, what is your conclusion in this case.<br /><br />HOLMES: Ah. My conclusion is that we have been conspired against by men from the future.<br /><br />WATSON: Good Lord! Is that possible?<br /><br />HOLMES: I am forced to deduce it from the evidence. Outside we hear the reassuring clip-clop of horses and the rattle of carriages, but these men, inhabiting this same street, hear the sound of machines flying overhead.<br /><br />WATSON: Holmes, you never cease to astonish me. But what of this conspiracy?<br /><br />HOLMES: Seemingly it is the doing of an inter-galactic time-traveller, who I am led to believe is a sinister Chinaman called Doctor Hu. This cosmic mischief-maker hurtles across the centuries in a stolen police-box, accompanied only by a succession of \\"companions\\", who I understand to be attractive young women who run a lot. By his agency, we -- that's you and I, Watson -- have been constrained to have our lives re-lived in some future century. And these have been recorded as images on a kinematograph, and compressed, if you can believe it, onto a single spinning disc.<br /><br />WATSON: You mean, like a gramophone record?<br /><br />HOLMES: Just so, except smaller and much more difficult to get out of its case without bending it.<br /><br />WATSON: Remarkable. And they have recorded our expeditions and peregrinations?<br /><br />HOLMES: That is my conclusion. We two, and Mrs Hudson besides, have been mimicked and made a mockery of by skilled impersonators with preposterous names, like.... Cumberdick Bendersquatch, or some such thing. He, it seems, is my alter ego, while yours is colloquially known as \\"Tim from the office\\". I am unable to ascertain what office that might be, and can only surmise that he's a renegade government clerk fallen on hard times.<br /><br />WATSON: But why us, Holmes? What use can be made of our lives by these ruffians from another century?<br /><br />HOLMES:  Aha. Well, I have since delved further. And, as I suspected, there is second criminal mind at work, one that keeps to the shadows and dark places while he concocts his fiendish plots. You see, Watson, Doctor Hu is but the visible face, while the brain belongs to another.<br /><br />WATSON: Good Lord, Holmes, is there no end to the ingenuity of those who would bring us down? Does this mastermind have a name?<br /><br />HOLMES:  He does, yet I can hardly bring myself to utter it.<br /><br />WATSON: You don't mean--?<br /><br />HOLMES:  My nemesis? The one man of whom I fear I will never be rid? I wish it were not so. Yet I must conclude that it is.<br /><br />WATSON: Moffiarty!<br /><br />HOLMES:  Exactly so, Watson. The only begetter of this devilish scheme is indeed Professor Moffiarty. And Doctor Hu is Moffiarty's creature and does his bidding in all things.<br /><br />WATSON: Holmes, I shudder to think that your nemesis assaults us yet again! What mischief has this demon conjured up in that future time?<br /><br />HOLMES:  Killing, mostly. He is notorious as a killer and a destroyer of dreams. On a mere whim he has killed several of Doctor Hu's running \\"companions\\", some of them more than once, and left a trail of weeping women around the world who have followed the Doctor's adventures on the kinematograph. At any hour of the day or night their despairing wail can be heard: \\"Moffiarty!! Nooooooooo!!...crying now.\\"<br /><br />WATSON: Then, at the very least he deserves a straight left to the chin, for I abhor the maltreatment of the gentler sex. What a bounder!<br /><br />HOLMES:  Hush, Watson. I fancy the game is not yet afoot, still less ayard or amile. Let us ask ourselves the following questions....<br /><br />[The rest of Dr Watson's journal is missing, believed lost forever, though it is still on sale at a reasonable price and can be reviewed by anyone who hasn't read it]
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I've now read all of Gillian Flynn's novels. However, I read them in the opposite order that they were written. I found this particular novel to be better than Dark Places, but not half as good as Gone Girl.<br /><br />It was a very interesting and great mystery with several surprising twists. The main character was a bit strange, but it seems as though Gillian Flynn likes her main cast of characters to be strange.<br /><br />If you've never read anything from the author before, this isn't a bad place to start. Like I said before though, I personally enjoyed Gone Girl the most.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|I'm only a teen who shouldn't be interested in books, but as soon as I picked it up, I couldn't put it down! It's constant action and mystery. (And yes, a little gore) I would recommend it to 10-18 year olds. Quite an enjoyable book and above all, fun to read!

Most of the time my iphone and ipad cant find the device.i have a sony bravia smart tv and thought it shd work great but i have to reset it number of times and set it back up which takes a lot of time and patience.Same happens on my nexus too.Also its only limited to netflix and youtube. Need more apps .thiniking of returning it. Truly disappointed.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book started out strong - \\"snappy dialogue\\"- and I do see it's value as YA fiction.  I just felt it got a little slow as the story progressed.  The ending seemed a little rushed and predictable.  With that said, I would still recommend the book for teachers and parents who are looking for a vehicle to start a conversation with youth.
140006922X|5.0|Intriguing history of the man Jesus, not as the son of God. Author probably an Atheist. Assesses the Bible as history and identifies the large amount of inconsistencies and Biblical &#34;fact&#34;conflict as stated in other documentation of the times. Content includes History of the Jews, Romans, the Holy Land, assessment of New Testament authors where known. Born-Again-Christians, conservative Christians, and Believers would probably toss it after a few pages.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you haven't purchased this book yet, wait until 2014 when book 6 will be released. Otherwise You'll be hanging off your seat for months!<br /><br />Pros:<br />GRRM has gone back to some of the action that we've come to expect. Familiar faces and some new ones brighten this book in the series compared to the 4th book. (A Feast for Crows) Though as in all A Song of Ice and Fire books there is a dark overshadowing of everything. A little something that every one of us has been waiting for--no doubt. (Without spoiling it I can't say what; but something we all knew would one day happen finally does.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Huge cliffhanger.

B003XVYLDU|1.0|As a college kid I read one of his books and was really impressed.  But now, years later as a mature adult, I read Slaughterhouse-Five and thought only an immature person could appreciate such drivel.  The senseless bombing of Dresden, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe to rubble, was a tragedy.  Unfortunately, Vonnegut was too busy writing in his avant gard style to tell that story.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This film should have a boatload of awards behind it.  Everything about it is fantastic, the acting, the cinematography, the costumes, the music.....I could go on.  And as another reviewer said, don't bother renting, purchase it, because you're going to want to watch it again, and again!
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|A masterpiece of a film. Truly awe inspiring in style and storyline. Haunting, exciting, even funny at times.<br />And with a score for the ages. Will become a cult classic like Blade Runner and Donnie Darko.
B00EVCGUNY|5.0|I heard this band for the first time while running through my car's satellite radio channels - would have never heard of them otherwise. The song that caught my attention was \\"Hey Now\\" but on listening to the samples of this album I was actually very impressed. Although relatively young, they sound like a much more experiences and polished band and are likely to have wide appeal across demographic boundaries. My only worry is that like many emerging acts from Britain (think Adele) they will get killed by the mainstream... Hannah Reid is an amazing singer and Dot Major and Dan Rothman are amazing musicians and they're all great composers and lyricists especially Hannah Reid. They are coming to Seattle soon and I am looking forward to seeing them live....

B00785P2QC|4.0|I just started playing but so far it doesn't seem like a bad game.  Yes, it does ask you to post to Facebook a lot but you get rewarded for doing so.  In my opinion if it gives you the chance to earn virtual cash or whatever it is called in the game versus having to actually buy cash with real money than I am all for it.  There aren't enough games that give you that option on the market right now.<br /><br />The only drawback I can see is the amount of time it may take to earn credits to move forward or open new buildings, but at the same time that is enough to make one want to work a little harder to do just that.  I am giving it four stars for now.  After I've played for some time I will change my review accordingly, if need be.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|People knock the sequels.  But i particularly love them and the quality.  The blu ray transfer does this groundbreaking film justice.  Pick it up!
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Against my better judgement I gave this a shot. Okay story. Less than interesting setting- pretty standard for fantasy (I think). Most of the characters a cliche. The imp being the salient exception. Writing is decent. Won't read the second one though.

B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I have two Loftek CXS 2200 webcams, and this app works flawlessly with them. I tried several other apps, including the Loftek app, and nothing comes even close. This app is so good that I got the paid Android version AND the paid iOS version. I can check my webcams from my Kindle Fire HD, my Motorola RAZR, and my iPad! Of course, try the free version of this app first, to ensure that it works on your phone/tablet, and with your webcam (and if it doesn't, it might be your webcam's fault! he he), and if it works I encourage you to get the paid version, not only because you can control several webcams, but also because you help support the developer. And this particular developer deserves a standing ovation!!!
B00000428L|5.0|Karajan was a great exponent of Richard Strauss, but there's something truly extraordinary even for him about this recording, as other reviewers have noted.  It has a great sense of freedom, a contrast from the famous Berlin recording remastered on the DG Originals series.  Karajan represented the very heights of greatness as a conductor, but he rarely relaxed or loosened his intense grip.  That was actually an incredible strength of his, but showpieces like Also Sprach Zarathustra can use transparent virtuosity, which the DG Originals disc doesn't have.<br /><br />That's all a prelude to saying that on this Vienna Phil reading from 1960, Karajan finds an almost rhapsodic voice that is probably unparalleled.  In this case, the orchestral playing is voiced with freshness that allows the individuality and deliciousness of the Vienna Phil to come forth.  There's a naturalness that reminds us that the Vienna Phil is to the manner born in Strauss.  Instead of being hit by one huge sheen of sound as on the Originals, we hear many layers of orchestral color.<br /><br />Never fear though, for Karajan hasn't lost his masterly hand.  The added feeling of freshness doesn't mean that Karajan has cut back on intensity.  There's still a great feeling of decisiveness and the ability to phrase with pinpoint accuracy.  It's a rare combination that should be celebrated.  While other virtuoso readings of these work have sprung up, the passion and Karajan's complete affinity for Strauss would be hard to match.  You'd never know that Zarathustra is an oft-played work that has become a sonic blockbuster.  The generous fillers ring with the same fervency.  The Dance of the Seven Veils actually seems to lilt.<br /><br />One could go into detail about the specifics of each interpretation, but I'll leave the discovery to the listener.  All I can say is that it is indispensable and belongs in any Strauss library.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|Awesome and Hilarious!! I strongly reccom mend this movie to anyone that hasn't Seen it! Ben Stiller is Epic!! Watch it!

B00D2MC8WG|5.0|Gustavo Dudamel has made a big splash on the international music scene and has fostered a great relationship with the Berlin Phil as a favored guest conductor.  Despite his reputation as a dazzling showman, it's been thrilling to follow Dudamel as he blossoms into a startlingly mature conductor.  Earlier this year we heard a great Mahler 9th from Los Angeles that had the all the commitment of a skilled veteran.<br /><br />Actually, it's about time to stop viewing Dudamel as up-and-coming and acknowledge that he's already arrived.  As a sad commentary on the state of the recording industry, very few discs from guest conductors have been released at Berlin during Simon Rattle's tenure.  (EMI wasn't generous with Rattle, either.)  Now that we finally can hear Dudamel at the helm of this great orchestra, we hear how masterly he truly is.  It must be a temptation for a young maestro to be enamored in the sound of the Berliners and forget to deliver an actual interpretation.  But Dudamel conducts with authority that gives no hint of a need to grow.  He produces a wonderful, rich sound that brings out the individuality of the Berliners, yet there's no pretentiousness or fussiness.  His control is truly captivating.<br /><br />Karajan was a great exponent of Strauss, with a particularly gripping reading of Also Sprach Zarathustra on Decca with the Vienna Phil, but neither Abbado or Rattle have recorded it.  Dudamel has the advantage of impeccable modern sound from DG which produces maximum impact.  The thrill of hearing the most dazzling virtuosos in the world give their all is twice as mesmerizing when we feel we can hear each individual instrument no matter how crushing the total volume.  Dudamel certainly deserves a lion's share of the credit for achieving dramatic continuum that revels in each moment without either loitering or becoming impatient.  In a promotional video, Dudamel said he viewed this live recording as one of the high points of his career.  It's easy to agree in the face of conducting that is so natural and effervescent.  I'd have to agree with the previous reviewer who finds Dudamel particularly thoughtful and measured.  I'd also agree that the fillers don't have the same impact, but they're still a treasure in their own right--readings on this level aren't released every day.<br /><br />At this point I think Dudamel's boyish image as portrayed by the media has traces of inaccuracy, at least in relating to his actual style.  All throughout this disc there is a feeling of abandonment but also of complete confidence.  Dudamel comes to the core of the Germanic repertoire with freshness, to be sure, but with definite indications of experience.  It's a marvel hearing him guide the orchestra with adeptness that balances everything perfectly while still welding everything into compact, intense whole.<br /><br />Considering that Berlin is searching for a new conductor in 2018, a major new release like this one makes one wonder if Dudamel is posing as a candidate.  He's a dark-horse candidate to be sure, but I have no doubt that he is better prepared for the task than Christian Thielemann , the current favorite.  In the meantime, we have a Strauss disc that is truly unforgettable.gree in the face of conducting that is so natural and effervescent.

B00EMQIMTE|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is Holly Golightly. There is and was only one. It is hard to describe the attraction of this film, yet it still captivates me every time I view it. I think it has something to do with the time and place when it was made, a carefree time that exists no longer and a time when new mores were coming into vogue. It has an IN quality about it, yet underneath it all, there remains a search for what life is really all about and what really makes us happy, in a fulfilling way, after all those cocktails have been downed and the cigarette smoke has cleared. I suppose there is some comment being made about the morality of the lifestyles of both Holly and Paul (George Peppard) Varjak. Both seem to subsist on the money of others (Holly from her numerous men friends and Paul from his older female sexual benefactor Patricia Neal). Hepburn gives her character a glossy veneer of sophistication and a detached indifference for meaningful love and relationships from the opposite sex. Peppard in a very good and underplayed performance seems to be her conscience even though he has a difficult time putting his own life in order. Through all the partying and merriment I found Buddy Ebsen's performance as Doc to be the most touching and moving. He seemed to represent a yearning for a much more simpler and tranquil lifestyle, truly loving his Holly to make it all complete. Ebsen's performance is heartbreaking, as he must leave his Holly in a world very foreign to him, leaving the void in his heart still empty on his journey back home. I think Peppard sees this and knows he must change his ways and also those of Holly for whom he is so attracted. This is a truly wonderful entertaining and rewarding film working on so many levels. Adding to the overall effect is Henry Mancini's timely score that is so vibrant, elegant and sentimentally moving and captures the essence of the story so satisfyingly.
0316056898|4.0|Tina Fey is a great narrator for the book about Tina Fey. I can't imagine going through this book any other way; skits and voice impersonations were a nice touch.<br /><br />My one criticism of the book is that it could have been a bit more focused on the main topic - women in leadership positions. There were great points here and there, but I think she could have incorporated more of her experiences getting there and being there without all of the frilly and sometimes unnecessary life stories and comments.<br /><br />Overall, the book was greatly entertaining and I would recommend it.

B00EMQK32I|5.0|WE WERE SOLDIERS is a very thought provoking film in effect focusing on a single engagement early in the Vietnam War.  It is a powerful and emotional film that avoids the bigger picture, the political events, and hones in on the men and their conduct in a very intimate way. WE WERE SOLDIERS focuses on the combatants. We see the tactics and the strategies employed by both sides. We see both sides in this engagement and somehow that too is the powerful image of this film. We see the North Vietnamese army, not as a ragtag militia force, but as a real army of thinking and dedicated men of conviction. Once on the ground, it is also interesting to see just how things escalate just within the confines of this engagement. I thought both Mel Gibson and Duong Don portrayed their characters as opposing commanders in the field as thinking men, as caring men and elevated this film beyond what could have been just another clich&eacute;d war film. This film really defines the phrase \\"thought provoking.\\"

B00ADS98FC|5.0|This film was a fun watch! In addition to being so unique & entertaining, it was also a great study about this Millennial generation. The interactions between these students and the lives they lead are vastly different from those of the Brat Pack. Of the seven core traits of Millennials (special, sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, and achieving), these students exemplified them all in one manner or another. The interpersonal relationships & group dynamics give life to these characteristics through romantic relationships & a cappella competitions. From feeling pressured to perform without fault, to following leaders without question, these students are without a doubt a study in contrasts with older generations. Fortunately, this film is still accessible to these other generations & can even be used as a way to orient oneself in relation to how these students live and thrive.

B005MLTGWK|5.0|This DVD contains six one-hour episodes that cover the first three books in Kate Atkinson's popular Jackson Brodie series. Jason Isaacs is perfectly cast as Jackson Brodie, Millie Innes is delightful as his daughter, Marlee, Amanda Abbington does a great DC Louise Munroe, Phillip Davis departs from his usual bad guy casting to play a lovely Theo Wyre, Sylvia Syms is marvellous as Binky Rain and Natasha Little plays an excellent Julia Land. The episodes based on Case Histories depart from that by being set in Edinburgh and introducing DC Munroe early, but apart from that, follows the book quite well and is very enjoyable. The next two episodes, based on One Good Turn, follow the general plot of the book but with some significant changes that involve Jackson more in events than in the book. Despite these departures, they are still very enjoyable. Brian McCardie plays the perfect villain, Terence Smith, in these two episodes, and Orla O'Rourke does a great Tatiana. The last two episodes are based on When Will There Be Good News. Gwyneth Keyworth plays a delightful Reggie Chase. Once again, there are significant departures from the book, but the bones of the plot are adhered to. There is more interaction between Munroe and Brodie, and it will be interesting to see how this plays out in series two, as Munroe is largely absent in the next book. Very watchable!
B000V6I7WG|3.0|It's rather difficult to review this movie without revealing smoething significant about the plot. Here's the best I could do without containing spoilers:<br /><br />Oldboy has good pacing great acting and excellent cinematography. Unfortunately these upsides only end up magnifying the great downside - Oldboy is a sick film. As the film unravels you get a good feel for the characters. Normally this is a major plus, but when something startling/disturbing happens it's twice as shocking because you've developed a rooting interest for the people involved. I'm all for suspense and shock value as much as the next person but I feel there should always be boundaries - trust me when I say Oldboy intentionally runs right over them. As engaging as the film is there are certain parts that ruin an otherwise great movie by trying too hard to be provocative.<br /><br />I can honestly say it's impossible for a normal person to walk away without feeling seriously disturbed. Some may argue that's the entire point of the film. While I certainly agree, I counter with this question: At what cost? Should directors be allow to put anything and everything in a film for shock value? Are you willing to watch anything for suspense? Where is the line drawn? It's a slippery slope, and I feel this movie slide right off the cliff.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|The production values make this a film worth seeing. If you are into a class tale of apocalyptic zombism, then WORLD WAR Z will entertain. The reality based narrative style of WORLD WAR Z impressed me. The acting also, is top notch. Brad Pitt is very convincing and very engaging in his role.  His screen presence alone is a big factor why this film works. Along with the excellent production values and director Marc Forster's very artistic eye for storytelling (QUANTUM OF SOLACE, MONSTER'S BALL, FINDING NEVERLAND) this film is rather exceptional.
0375714839|5.0|I'm reading this for a masters course as a paired text with a high school student.  I owned the two original volumes and let a friend borrow them, never to be returned.  I have owned the film since it's DVD release and I like to show certain scenes to my student so that she gets the emotional impact of who she describes as &#34;a pretty much normal rebellious girl like me.&#34;
B008WCP2PG|5.0|The package said ultra violet digital copy but I don't think I got that part cuz I only have one disc. Any way great movie and I seen it in the theaters was good. Fast delivery and great condition. The main actors did a great job. Tatum can dance and hot body. If you like this kind of movie it was good.
B0057FHYM0|5.0|So much comes to mind when I think of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. It is jubilant, heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting to the spirit, this film demonstrates and is a tribute to all the goodness there is in the world and what life has to offer and what we can strive for. I saw this film when I was a little boy and well it was good I suppose but it has grown to mean much more to me with each passing year. There is goodness and love and tragedy in the world as I have now come to realize but when your spirits are low you can return to this film and remember and savor the lessons you have learned and reflect back and see parallels in the images that you once never truly saw. For a film that is greatness I suppose. Someone recently reintroduced me to this film and it has taken on a whole new meaning for me. Happiness is where you find it and make it. The one character that left an indelible image with me was Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte). Captain Von Trappe (Christopher Plummer) implores him to \\"Come with us.\\" Rolfe had his chance to live life as a human being but he chose otherwise and in doing so gave up his chance for happiness. As a viewer, choose happiness and indulge yourself in this film. You will truly take away something of value each time you view it.<br /><br />Such great talents are associated with this film. The prolific Robert Wise once again demonstrated his vast array of directorial talents (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, EXECUTIVE SUITE, THE HAUNTING, WEST SIDE STORY, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP) being able to produce yet another gem regardless of the genre. That is a rare thing and Wise certainly seemed like the man for that job on this film given his gentle demeanor and eye for good storytelling. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman is another prolific talent with screenplays for EXECUTIVE SUITE, SABRINA, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and THE KING AND I to his name. Production Designer Boris Leven also was another prolific fellow with production designs such as GIANT, JOHN PAUL JONES and WEST SIDE STORY to his name. The entire cast is excellent. Julie Andrew's naïve yet intuitive qualities as Maria matched against the outwardly stern and overtly proud Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trappe, who's personalities must eventually come together in order for them to become life loved partners is brilliantly performed by these two. Particular note should be made to Richard Hayden's performance as Max Detweiler Von Trappe's friend otherwise talent agent who acts as the liaison with the audience with his wry visual expressions.OHN PAUL JONES and WEST SIDE STORY to his name.

B000JIHP88|5.0|the leaves move up and down, the animals are bright and colorful.  the music is OK its like an mp 3 but not real instruments, the baby likes it.  The rain-forest noise is very quiet, she does not like it(crickets and monkeys).  The remote doesn't work incredibly well, but I have not tried to change the batteries.  you can choose light, music or motion, or any combo of those three.  The top is removable for when you baby is older. The batteries have lasted in excess of 13 weeks so far.  As a note you must have this thing on a crib with bars and spaces. it attaches by screwing thought a space between the bars, so you can't attach it to a standard pack and play or co-sleeper.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|Lots of action in this movie, I seen this with my grandson and he really knew what was going on with the actors. I got for his enterainment  but I also enjoyed it. I would recommend this movie to action pack lovers out there. Fast delivery for its price.
0141345713|5.0|A great tear jerker, and rumors are being spread about a movie coming out so get a hold of this read before the movie comes out.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Maggie Smith is always great. I really enjoyed it!!!<br />A touching story of a prima donna in the opera world.<br />Great fun!
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Don't be wearing a heart monitor when you watch this!! Lots of action and nail biting with this one. I thought my monitor was going to was going to call 911 during some of the action scenes.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This ones a real hoot. Great for the whole family. So much better than the trashy movies out today. I do recommend this one.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is a great movie for 1956. It still holds up rather well to today's movies even tho it lacks the effects of today's stuff. Highly  Recommended!
B00C061I3K|5.0|Got the album and have been hooked over it. Random Access Memories is a Tribute to classic styles of music and its felt in this album I have five favorite tracks on this which are<br /><br />Doing It Right<br />Contact<br />Get Lucky<br />Loose Yourself to Dance<br />Give life back to Music<br /><br />Glad I got it!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the game one of the best endless runners.  Highly addictive and somewhat innovative. Reccomended for fans of the movie and fans od games in general.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I LOVE this game. The very first time I started finding the hidden numbers I found myself completing the whole game in one day because I couldnt put it down!
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|What a piece of garbage. It is even worse than a free one which came with my Kindle Fire HD. That  original one would loose the ability to send emails. So, I took it off and got the Tab for Kindle for 99 coins.<br /><br />It is very awkward, slow to load, only appears in landscape and then it kept freezing and rendering my Kindle useless.<br /><br />It behaves like some sort of bad browser bookmake.<br /><br />Save your coins!
B004XANKVO|4.0|Great bag.<br />Pros:<br />Quality construction<br />Plenty of storage space<br />Weather resistant<br /><br />Cons:<br />A little on the big side<br /><br />Overall the bag has met all of my expectations.  It has a ton of storage space.  I haven't used all of it yet.  Its big enough to double as an overnight bag as long as your not packing a suit.  I live in Seattle and therefore I'm in the rain a lot.  While not waterproof, it has kept my equipment dry on wet days.  Its worth the price.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I was never into Star Trek until JJ's 2009 take on the story. I loved the new cast and relationships. Into Darkness is even better. Pure pleasure for a &#34;Cumberbitch&#34; and a &#34;PineNut&#34;.  Does Zach have a name for his fans? I love watching him too!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Not much to the game, addictability is negligible and the extras are not inspiring.  Okay for kids to play, but the coins go too quick to keep them engaged in the game.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This wasnt a bad book but i didn't cry like everyone else said i would. I'm used to reading Lurlenne McDaniel books they made me cry this didn't
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|That Brandon Sanderson writes fiction well is obvious, but that his fiction is more true than much non fiction<br />is a welcome revelation to any story lover. His plots and characters are well drawn and fit nicely. When you write this well,<br />noone else can do what you do. Another fantastic original that is an instant classic.<br />I will end this review by saying I will seek out his other books immediately.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|It works great. I have tried many apps and it works GREAT with them. I was super happy. I did not quite beloved the reveiws until now. Thanks.
0143116177|3.0|This book is an interesting account of the origins of many of today's financial institutions like the Banks, Share Markets, Bond Markets, Central Banking, etc. However, the problem I see in this book is that it has a very biased point of view. It seems as if it sets out to erase the actual origins of credit, banking,markets and in general the world system that existed centuries before the rise of the West and which was actually the foundation upon which the Venetians, Genovese, Dutch and British innovated. If one only reads this book you would think there was no trade before the 1400s when that is absolutely not case. To cover that era one can read Abu-Lughod's Before European Hegemony and learn about the trade and credit systems used in long distance commerce. Niall Fergusson doesn't mention any of this.<br />  But it's not just Fergusson's omissions that make me think of propaganda, it was assertions like the one he makes on page 135: \\"He was ruthless in his treatment of competitors, executing British East India Company officials at Amboyna and effectively wiping out the indigenous Bandanese.  A natural-born empire builder...\\" The author's personal views on the European Empires take center in what seems to be an effort to show the West as the sole creator of today's financial markets. No wonder his next book was called The West and the Rest...
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well written  with all the right elements suspenseful,  unpredictable, and captivating. Would highly recommend, a gripping moral dilemma that begs the question; what would you do?
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I have no use for this unless the real game is available to download.  I haven't been able to find it.
0307744434|5.0|This is a lovely, engaging fable.<br /><br />It was perhaps oversold by the PR folks, which may account for the disappointed expectations of the few unhappy reviewers.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I liked it because it dealt in how jealously and lies can destroy not only a person but a world!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset met most of my expectations. For the price I feel it delivers.<br /><br />+ Very comfortable. I have worn these for 5 to 6 hours at a time with no discomfort. They don't make my head feel warm like other headsets I have tried. I also don't feel the need to take them off after wearing them for many hours.<br />+ Freedom with wireless is great. I love being able to get up and walk around without having to take the headset off.<br />+ Excellent battery life.<br />+ Microphone quality is excellent.<br /><br />- Sound quality of the headphones is average. Overall clear and clean sound, but lacking some power and fidelity in my opinion. Can probably be remedied with some EQ tuning.<br /><br />Out of the box I had a few problems but I was able to remedy them fairly quickly. Initially after turning on the headset for the first time, it would drop the connection and reconnect. This was happening every 10 minutes. I was able to fix this by changing the wireless channel on my router (2.4GHz band) to channel 11. I also set the bandwidth from 20MHz to Auto(20MHz/40MHz). After doing this I no longer experience disconnects.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I didn't think it wld b a game I liked.  However I ended up getting sucked into it. I m not a game player bc games usually r like all the others. I don't usually like village type games but this had fun playing games w/in it.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Toddler Aquarium is the perfect game for your children to learn their ABC's in a fantastic way. The app goes through the entire alphabet starting from which ever letter your child would like and proceeds from the selected letter. So if your child clicks on the letter J it will proceed K then so forth. There are four games per letter that your child will play before moving on to the next letter. The first game is a puzzle which makes up the shape of the letter selected. This teaches the child how to form the letter. The second game is matching the shape of the letter to a set of letters given below then your child will piece together a puzzle of a thing that starts with the letter you just matched (such as B and you will have to piece together a boat). The third game is matching a set of pictures to the proper word that begins with the letter. Finally the game follows up with another set of word matching and from completion your child will move on to the next letter. The game focuses on repetition, saying the letter to your child multiple times. Also after completing matching with words of a particular letter, the game pronounces all the items listed. This will help your child remember what they have just learned. The game not only helps your child remember what they are learning but they will also love the graphics and interactive play that Letter Quiz Aquarium provides. There is a beach theme with cute little grabs holding the puzzle pieces and  the shore washes in the items that match the words above. The game also does a great job of pronunciation of all the words and letters. I highly recommend this game for anyone who has a young child, niece, nephew, or is a baby sitter; it will keep your child entertained for hours upon hours.
B0095NCXKI|5.0|I have always been a fan of Kat Dennings dry delivery, and she doesn't disappoint with her character Max in 2 Broke Girls.<br /><br />Dealing with minimal income and a new overly cheery waitress is enough to make anyone hate life. Yet Max keeps going, accepting of her life, until Caroline convinces her to dream bigger by starting a cupcake business.<br /><br />The comedy is just over the top enough to know the writers aren't trying to make the show serious, and the constant jabs at hipsters are plenty (plenty welcome).<br /><br />Highly recommended if you want a good twenty minutes of sarcasm and high jinks.
B009X2CRMK|4.0|A mystery story which unfolds through the discoveries of an abandoned child and later, her granddaughter, over a period of thirty years, keeps one enthralled to the very end.
0792839749|4.0|This has been on our list to acquire for our home library for years.  It's a bit long in the tooth, and shows a similarity to productions like The Great Race (Tony Curtis) and Disney's Mary Poppins (did they share the same choreographer?), but the transforming car is well worth a look.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app lets you draw anthing. The colors are endless. I love this app. You  can save your drawing. Get this game.
B00170F0WU|5.0|This style of gangster movie does not feature an Italian hit squad but an Italian contracted killer that connects the viewer still suddenly with the mafia underworld as you sit there watching the main character receives his jobs or contract hits or while listening as the main character takes a call from a client to cancel a job is still intenseful and suspenseful. The additonal challenge for the main character for a fee will deal with the crooked narcotics agents.  Those crooked narcotics agents have plenty to answer to for their misconduct while in public office but in the movie they finally realize they should have only one concern with hopeing to find their new shadow first before it finds them.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Thomas has done it again! 19 Amazing songs that are all unique. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys orchestral music, and the price is great!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As a non christian I may be a but more open to a historical interpretation of who and what Jesus of Nazareth was, but Reza Aslan does not take a position of arrogant omniscience rather one of academia. This book is an honest, critical, reasonable evaluation of the historical Jesus and also provides a marvelous insight into the world in which this influential man lived.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is a great game.  My son and daughter have had a ball!  I love that they can EARN the credits, instead of always having to buy them.  I would highly recommend this game.
B00DGKVW9Y|2.0|I purchased this a week before leaving for India for ten days.  I really wanted to love it, but I couldn’t.  The sound quality was very good but navigation was a kludge.  There is really no excuse for such a basic and non-user friendly frontend but I hopped to get past that.  Battery life is very poor but Cathay Pacific has USB ports so that is not an issue but then the troubles started.  I may have had a faulty unit but I didn’t have the time to mess with it.  Songs would just stop playing or get all jumbled and stop playing, requiring a hard reset every time.  Then the unit bricked and would not even respond to a hard reset.  Contacted FiiO and after a few days they suggested updating the firmware.  Tied twice with no luck.  I was running out of time so I returned the unit for a refund.  With a good firmware upgrade, correcting the very poor navigation, this might be a good unit but I feel FiiO released it a little too soon.
B005F3XV62|5.0|Great Movie - Underrated<br /><br />A lot of funny one liners<br /><br />Kids movie, I think not!<br /><br />Great Cast<br /><br />Classic Kevin James
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a most wonderful coming of age book!  I was pulled in immediately by the premise and the characters.  I rooted for the good guys.  I quietly cheered when things went well.  I had to put  the book aside for a few minutes when the tension got to be too much for me to keep reading. I am a teacher, and would recommend this book as required reading for all middle school students. Brava to the author.<br /><br />It's been an hour since I finished the book, Wonder.  I can't get it out of my mind.  I am curious about the characters and how they develop as they grow up.  I am already hoping for a sequel.<br /><br />Remember, kindness matters.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Can't say how much I love this book. Walter Isaacson is an artist. The amount of interviews and research he did to write a fair and complete biography on the life, psychology, and success of Steve Jobs is remarkable. Recommend to read this if you're interested in entrepreneurship, psychology, successful people, or the history of technology.
0316123587|5.0|This book is everything its described to be. Came in great condition, shipping was fast! This was a gift and was very well received!!
B0042VJSVU|5.0|I bought the grey market flash instead of the one officially imported and supported by Nikon USA.<br />I never had any issues with past Nikon flashes so I took the risk and savings.<br />Flash came just as expected.<br />It's fantastic.<br />Had the larger SB-910 flash before but sold it again after a few months. Reason: Didn't need the power/features of the SB-910.<br />Major differences are commander flash group's (SB-700 has Master, A and B vs Master, A, B and C on the SB-910) SB-910 reaches farther as well but for me the smaller more portable SB-700 is better.<br />It does everything but is for sure a bit limited compared to the SB-910 but I'd say that only matters to professionals, I'm not a professional.<br />I like the controls. TTL-BL (balanced light flash with matrix metering) and i-TTL with spot metering. Also FP is no longer displayed on the flash (set in camera menu anyways). Overall a fantastic flash, I'm using it with a D600.
0618001905|5.0|Very great read for entertainment. Hochschild is a journalist by trade, so you have to be prepared for some bias, but it is mostly neutral.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Absorbing detail. I thought I was tired of slavery and racial tension  books but  I fell in love with the characters GRISSOM delineated. I could not put the book down  as I was dying to know what happened to each of them.
0439813786|5.0|For anyone out there looking for a touching and engaging story, I cannot sing Brian Selznick's \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" enough praises.  As the story opens we meet Hugo Cabret as he moves through the train station he calls home.  We follow him through his daily daily as we learn about his personal tragedies and his obsession- the mysterious automaton that had consumed his father's attention. His need for spare pieces of machinery to repair it leads him to encounter the local toy maker, opening new avenues of possibilities and friendship.  This touching story sucks you in and has you hooked before the first line of text.  Selznick's inventive idea to tell the story using sequences of pictures as well as text truly allows you as the reader to see Hugo's world just as Mr. Selznick imagined it himself.  The inclusion of Selznick's illustrations adds a dimension to the story that is both inventive and original.  This is a book that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a beautiful and unique story to fill their time!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Actually, Tom Cruise has come back to Earth (in real life) and his being cast in a Sci-Fi movie occurring right here on earth is quite appropriate. But I love a good Sci-Fi movie and this one is pretty good. It evokes emotions like 2001 Space Odyssey. Beautiful. You don't like the acting? What are you comparing it to? Its Tom Cruise. Hey, he does all his own stunts, convincingly. He's no J. Nicholson or A. Hopkins but he's not a bad actor. I'm glad he's come back to reality (again, in real life). You think there is too much CGI? Too Digital? Again, what are you comparing it to? Are you sure you knew you were watching a Sci-Fi movie? Actually if you watch the \\"Making of\\" on the blu-ray it explains there is a lot more \\"reality\\" in the movie than you might think and less CGI. But its a modern science fiction movie. CGI is required to tell the story, but I think this movie is a perfect balance. The drones are the coolest, even though they are villains. I love the noises they make... kind of like R2-D2 on steroids. The score is fantastic. You can watch the movie with only the score playing. That's a little weird, but the score can probably stand on its own if you are into just listening to a movie soundtrack by itself. One question I have about one of the characters, Vika, is why are her eyes so dilated all the time? It is spooky looking. Why I am writing a review of this movie that hundreds of people have already given their dumb opinions of, I don't know. Just thought I would offer mine because I liked it so much. Besides the movie, the \\"making of\\" is a very interesting documentary. Its in 5 parts and in HD as well. Its almost as good as the movie itself. I own the blu-ray and the video is of outstanding quality. Can't comment on the audio since I have not watched it with surround.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Awesome story. Kept me riveted the whole way through. Can't wait to read the next two books.  This is a must read for any sci-fi fan.
0517543052|5.0|reading this book. ha<br />This book is amazing. I highly recommend it. It does more than open your eyes to stay in the present.
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|A compulsive thriller. The early stages dragged a bit but the narrative gained momentum about 30% in and I was hooked.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great game<br /><br />Continuous play better than game 4' more flexible an  less expensive truly brilliant  progression and wonderful outfits. I truly love this game
0060936223|5.0|I am a huge fan of Smith, and it took me a while to get around to reading this book and was in a pile of a pile.  To wait for it, and to have it whisper to me for so long was a gift.  It is an intense and subtle, engaging and sleepy, bright and dark vision into one of the most recognizable artists as she recounts her years as she rose from the concrete during one of the most important artistic periods in American history.  It is a document of not only her life developing as an artist, but of her contemporaries.  The real beauty of this book lies not within the shining fame of its author as she recounts her exploits, but of the subtlety and fascination she had with Mapplethorpe.<br /><br />Reading many reviews of this book, it is clear that many people have either missed the mark, or missed the beauty intrinsic with her relationship with Robert in the book.  The most beautiful moments in the book are where she magically describes, revisits, and explores the unconventional but purely loving relationship that they shared during his life.  Interestingly, the book becomes less about this rock and roll goddess thrown into a career that was seemingly an afterthought (at least to me), and more about the love and the hope and the relationships that she shared with the magical people around her - and ultimately I believe that this is where this book takes the most beauty in its most elemental state.<br /><br />It is a book about beautiful love, in a beautiful universe, and you find yourself rooting for these beautiful characters immersed in the poetic and simple prose of Smith as she helps us navigate and identify and experience the New York that has been lost in decades, completely unrecognizable to us and today's Disneyfied Manhattan.  The words are prolific but sparse, charged with immediacy while the events and people they describe are long gone.  It is a document of our artistic history and an actualization of the difficulty of expressing love in language and gestures.  Simply beautiful and American.Simply beautiful and American.
0307887448|5.0|The three things this book does, is:<br /><br />One, it is incredibly full of video game, tv show, and overall pop culture references from the 80's it blows my mind. I didn't grow up during that time period, and I didn't understand most of the references, but I have a love for them without ever seeing, hearing of, or playing them in my life. That's how good the writing is! If you have any knowledge or nostalgia for the time period, even if you never touched an arcade, you should read this book.<br /><br />Two, the book completely pulls you into another world. It may not seem from the description of the book that you will feel like you are in another universe, but that is exactly what the book is. You will feel like you are sitting right next to the protagonist the entire time. It helped me to think creatively and it had me wondering what was coming next through the entire book. You find yourself jealous of the protagonist at times, as well as thankful for what you have at others.<br /><br />And lastly, this book has a great message. Sorry to break it to some of you, but this game isn't all about video games. Okay, I'll admit, its mostly all about video games. But the underlying tone and message of the entire book is very different from what you might expect. Without revealing anything super big, I will just mention that this book caused for a lot of self inspection and discovery. It didn't ever make me feel bad, but it made me think about my life in ways that I had not in a very long time. To help you understand further what I mean, I recommended this book to a friend I have that is wasting his life away in front of his computer in his parents house, not doing anything with his life. I hope it will help him realize some things that i learned while reading it.<br /><br />This book is already one of my favorites. I have actually never written a review of a book before, if that tells you anything. This is worth your time, money, and any thoughts you may expend while thinking about what the author is trying to teach us about life.
0375869026|5.0|My son told me he has to bring this book to school. So I placed n order. It arrived a few date late
B003FCVF6I|4.0|If you are interested in everything that happened with your favorite gaming company, this book has it. Going as far as the release of the Playstation 2, the histories behind several consoles and games are a sure hit if you enjoy the backstage events leading to each product. Easy to read, and plenty of details.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This man is a musical genius. I loved all of the songs on his track. i was not disappointed with this cd
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Good game Nice way to pass the time. I highly recommend it.  Tutorial is a little less then further coming with the intricacies of the game.
B00CGYK9O0|5.0|Super cute stickers and I loved that the chalk is included. Makes things much easier. Can't wait to use them at our wedding.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|I bought this item for my son. He loves minecraft. All you should do is slightly larger pieces.It really is much like the game.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Art of War was recommended to me by another artist friend. I was so blocked, I couldn't, wouldn't, and possibly didn't want to read it then. A year later and gaining momentum back in the studio, I picked it up to see what was so good about this book. It's simply a rare gem amidst  similar books I have read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Definitely helps to increase your memory. Love the detective aspect of game. Part puzzle part memory part detective great game.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|nice, simple, works, name your recording first, hit the red dot to record, hit the dot again to stop recording, hit the menu list icon to view what you recorded.  5 stars for doing all it says, and for it's cuteness as well.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this book at first. But before long I was hooked and devoured the next couple of books. Waiting on pins and needles for the 8th book to come out. Love all the knights and sorcery!!!!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Daniel best nuff said. This is one of my all-time favorite book series. You should definitely read . It do it now in fact
B00CTNUMPO|2.0|I like this movies, which I have seen many times with the same pleasure, so<br />I am still awaiting this disc !
B008BM9L72|2.0|Why should I have been drawn into the hype of this series? What a waste of time for any of you looking for a good read from a mature writer. Women's Erotica is just that when it is well written from someone who does not write from a naive 23 year-old.<br /><br />So you might make millions and a movie offer but you have left the integrity of the genre to the fame of the dollar. Sell your soul. The story line could have been so much more enticing had you gotten it edited and made your characters' ages more appropriate. I can go on with the criticism. Good luck with your career. Practice makes perfect. Already in the third novel, it was obvious you had gotten help in style and character development.
1439170916|5.0|This is one of the best resources for any cancer patient/survivor or professional. A must have in your library if you are a counselor, medical professional as well. I have given away several copies, so this is a replacement for my library as a breast cancer counselor and medical writer.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Watched the original with Stallone when I was a kid. I suppose every movie seems better when you're a kid. While the plotline has changed, and the sidekick is kinda cute (subjective, but this is an opinion anyway), it's still somewhat predictable. Definitely some interesting moments though. Action's ok if you take into account that, as with most other action flicks, they dodge bullets with the best of them and seem to survive a lot that's thrown at them, including armor piercing rounds!
B001PPGAIA|4.0|All around awesome, lovely, adventure, love-hate, epic movie. You won't regret watching this:)The scene is set during world war 2 in Australia played by Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. It has all that kind of romance stuff packed in this movie-- and you can probably forecast what would happen just by watching half of the movie.<br /><br />Love the beautiful scenery in the movie... while acting is a bit OKAY.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Great Movie!! All the kids love it in my house...  and the adults too!! Need more options to buy movies tho and not just rent.
0061906220|5.0|So I'm the aunt that gives little kids books for their birthdays. Of all the books I gave my nephew this is the one he LOVES. He has the book memorized forwards and backwards, side to side, and up and down. The book lends itself to re-reading because of how satisfying each little section concludes. The books has a certain beat that just makes it so fun to read. Everyone that picks this book up and reads it out loud has a different take on it. You can make it playful, educational, loud and/or silly.<br /><br />Besides being instructional (colors and keeping things positive) the book really fosters a love of reading as a fun activity and not a chore.<br /><br />I already bought him the other Pete the Cat books. He's a big fan. GET THIS BOOK!
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Great Movie!! All the kids love it in my house...  and the adults too!! Need more options to buy movies tho and not just rent.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's a great app, particularly since the constant ads have been pulled. Perhaps it was a system glitch. I still don't care for the chests that pop up pushing for cash purchases, but they aren't too intrusive. I would say closer to five stars but for that issue.
0393316041|5.0|Richard Feynman was an interesting and noteworthy human being in many ways. Not only did he make incredibly important contributions to science, he is still contributing to society through this book - in a major way. &#34;Surely You're Joking...&#34; paints a picture of a human being that we all strive to be: smart, funny, curious, playful, with a strong moral compass to guide our decisions. A fantastic and inspiring book.<br /><br />Thank you for existing, Mr. Feynman.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|The game is quite interesting, if a bit more than I had expected. The hidden pictures are timed and the items move around in the scenes from one viewing to the next. I play games for casual pleasure so this one is more difficult than I am used to playing. For the more serious enthusiast this would be a delightful challenge. Have fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent graphics and more challenging than most other mind puzzle games. Each stage has multiple tasks for you to complete or figure out.

B0000048CX|5.0|This album has a really warm and inviting tone to it that they would revisit with more maturity and vigor on And Then Something.... But it doesn't diminish this classic in any way whatsoever. It stands on its own and has a few outright gems that are better still than a lot of the modern stuff imo. The Tengo originals meld with the covers seamlessly and most would have no clue what they are listening to for the most part.<br /><br />I am not going to name single songs as I think an album such as this kind of flows purely as the best Tengo records do, but know that it is definitely a worthwhile purchase. I can listen to this one as long as any of their other releases and I have them all. Solid effort that doesn't quite sound like anything else they have done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sub way servfer is the greatest game on the planet I am so glad that I introduced his game to my step mom because now see has it on her iPod.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Personally I found the first book to be better but this one was just as perfect!! With lots of plot twists, and surprises around every page James ashamed does it again!! Can't wait to read the death cure!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Loved the story telling and the humor.. A way out of the malaise of the current employment funk. Encouragement and honesty about dealing with failure and misery..
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I've been using the Chromecast for about a month now and have found it to be a great device.<br /><br />Mine came with 3 months of Netflix and the integration is seamless. I find a video I want to watch on the Netflix app, push the play button and start watching it on my tv. From there the Chromecast does all the work and I can shut down my phone. Another other device (tablet, phone, etc) that's connected to the Chromecast can be used to pause/play the video at that point.<br /><br />I've also really enjoyed the YouTube integration.<br /><br />I would give the Chromecast 5-stars but the lack of services is why I'm rating it 4/5. With the addition of other services like HBO Go, Amazon Instant, etc I'll gladly give the Chromecast 5-stars.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|A lovely app. Bold and very useful with its electric blue tone and crisp graphics.  Phone alarm apps are too small.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Acting is superlative....Subtle glances and outright discussion make for a very engaging story...You can enjoy each episode individually ..but shines when you watch from the beginning season
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I have known a few young people who didn't deserve the scorn heaped upon them by others. I have often wondered how these unkind, shallow individuals can survive in our society when they treat people, especially young people, badly.  The book shows us how almost everyone can learn to be kind and loving if given the opportunity.  I loved this book!!

B00BY8DC2A|5.0|I really like The Brand New Heavies and when I saw this I had to have it.  It does not disappoint.  You will enjoy this CD if you are a fan.
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|This movie sucks.  It don't follow the original story line.  In this movie, they changed so much around from all the other movies, that they just made a mess.  If you have watched the other movies, and liked them, you won't be pleased with this one.
6305428042|5.0|I grew up with this movie. While it had a heavy role in my development, I have to say one of my favorite scenes was when the children befriended the zombie; what from whence they were afraid, they gained strength and rose again.

B00991TCOG|5.0|Loved it! If in bad mood,  pop it in and blast it and, brightens my mood almost immediately. Great buy,  very worth it!
B003XMWSSY|5.0|I review a book on writing differently than a fiction book. The criteria is simple. Did I learn anything and will I refer to the material over again? The answer here is YES And YES and that equals five stars.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Love the movie and love the extras!  This DVD/Blu-ray is exactly what I wanted.  Definitely recommend this as your next purchase.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I particularly enjoyed this DVD because it has subtitles available.  The music is beautiful and now I can &#34;hear&#34; the words
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I could always depend on it, until the last update. I had to redo the settings after it updated and I overslept!

0385349947|5.0|It is true that women tend to underestimate their talent and competence, where men overestimate theirs, and Sandberg rightly encourages them to raise their hands and sit at the table. I say: Build your own tables and redefine success and power for yourselves.Women do need to strengthen their trust in themselves, their inner authority, knowing, vision. One tool that helps is learning about the powerful correspondences between women's ways of knowing and changing and the emerging new science and evolutionary consciousness. They are both expressions of the archetypal feminine. The need for more women in positions of leadership is not a women's issue, nor only an issue of social equity. It is an urgent need for the entire world community to transform the meaning of power, success, leadership. Bringing feminine values, visionary power and enormous capacities for creativity is a leap into a different way of working and governing, that could help create \\"a world in which it will be easier to love\\" (Paulo Freire). So follow Arianna Huffington on the Third Metric, read Meg Wheatley \\" Leadership and the New Science\\", Sally Helgesen, especially her recent book \\"The Female Vision\\" with executive coach Julie Johnson, or Riane Eisler on creating a caring economy. What could change the world? if women regain their power. And leap wholeheartedly into the work that has meaning for you, your values, your vision.
B005LAII80|5.0|Highly under-appreciated, this is the best movie I have seen in a LONG time.  Simple, gritty, characters you care about, and a soundtrack that drives it all.  I like plot, not big explosion-filled brain dead fests, and this made it among my top 5 movies, so it's not a mind-numbing experience.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is the height of plot-development, I'm just demonstrating that if you think it is just a stupid shoot-em up, it isn't.  Give this a try, you won't regret it.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|No spoilers here. Just watch it. And watch your jaw drop at the end. Kevin Spacey is an amazing actor.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I found the book very interesting and descriptive. I felt like I was inside the character. I love reading these book!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This movie was not the price to watch and suggest that no one else watches it either.  Great actors bad plot and direction.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|it fit except I have problems when using to buttons at the top.Otherwise ita a good product.What the manufacturer can also do is provide a place for the stylus in future
B0015DROBO|5.0|I enjoyed the story because it had more than one plot in it. It kept me from putting it down.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Seemed like a similar news story, I could tell what was coming next. It was  a little slow at times
B002CNOA6S|5.0|Good movie! I cried & laughed!! Dustin Hoffman plays Raymond SO perfect!! I highly recommend watching Rain Man if you enjoy experiencing a wide range of emotions.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So much more than a \\"sex\\" novel!!!!!!! Every detail was exquisite!!!! So much to look forward to in books two & three.
1401324649|5.0|Folks, you've got to read this book if you want a good laugh from start to finish  If you want to see how one man affected history in Russia, the US, Spain, China, Korea, Bali, and on and on, this is the book for you.  The author is Swedish, and he must have had a lot of fun writing this satire!  Our 100-year-old-man is an explosives expert; loves his vodka; and loves adventure.  After he climbs out that window of the nursing home he was in, one by one, he meets some interesting characters.  The chase was on with one of the local policemen first searching for an elderly man who everybody was concerned about; then a mass murderer, yes the same elderly man; and then becoming one of our centenarian's group.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|If you are living overseas, this device is not the greatest.  That is because it does not work with a VPN.  So if you want to watch Netflix or Amazon prime using your chromecast, you are out of luck.<br /><br />Also, I was disappointed at the extremely limited compatibility with iPad.  Essentially, you can only cast YouTube and Netflix (but again, if you're overseas, not Netflix, because Netflix is not available to overseas users, unless you use a VPN).<br /><br />I was watching mlb.tv during the season, and that is not location restricted, so it was a lot of fun casting a tab from my desktop browser (careful, Chromecast only really works well with Windows 7 or 8 OS, you can try with XP, but it doesn't work that great, or not at all) and watching MLB games on my big screen without having to hook the lap top up to it with an HDMI cable.<br /><br />Overall, this device has a lot of potential.  And it is probably much, much cooler for U.S. users.  I'd definitely like it more if I could stream Netflix and Amazon Prime.<br /><br />I mainly wanted to post this review as a service to users overseas who could get their hands on one of these (i.e. U.S. military, diplomatic, or other expat); probably best to wait until Google makes it more compatible with VPN and iPad apps.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and addictive! I would definitely recommend this game if your looking for something that engages the mind to pass the time.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />I own all the Star Trek motion pictures on Blu-ray, both the Kirk and Picard versions, and have watched all of the others that are readily available on DVD or Netflix streaming.  I'm not Trekie enough to dress up or attend conventions, but I enjoy and admire the series, especially the historical continuity all the series tried hard to maintain.  J. J. Abrams has done some very fine film work, but his two CGI infested rapes of the Star Trek saga will never be find a place on my shelf.<br /><br />Had I never watched a moment of the Rodenberry and Rodenberry-inspired Star Trek saga, I would grant both films, at best, three stars and describe them as grossly over-CGIed and aimed at an audience without much of an attention span.  In other words, par for the Hollywood course.  But I have seen Rodenberry's work and those he inspired.  Even when he was bound and gagged by minuscule budget constraints everything on the original series, he did it so much better and with brain fully engaged.<br /><br />Both of Abrams' alternative versions destroy the history the various Star Trek series carefully constructed and maintained throughout a variety of series:  The destruction of Vulcan in the first film retained here; the out-of-character love interest between Spock and Uhura; the death of Christopher Pike that negates the original pilot later woven into a two-part story in the original series; an Enterprise bridge that looks nothing like the original; the frenetic behavior of every character except Spock that is nothing like the original characterizations (and this film ends where the TV series began); Carol Marcus's English accent in this film even though she was a an all-American girl in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn.  And speaking of Kahn, Into Darkness is in part a mirror-image recycle of Star Trek II's conclusion.  (Really uncreative, J. J.  I saw it coming a mile away.)  Benedict Cumberbatch is a fine actor and suitably maniacal as Kahn, but he makes a better Sherlock Holmes where he can display a range of emotion.  Here, he is as expressionless as a statue, no doubt at Abrams' direction.  Ricardo Montelban brought so much more flair to the character - twice.  And I here enter a plea to all film makers to stop asking the human body to survive unscathed the physically impossible.  You don't need science fiction for that.  Watch any James Bond film.<br /><br />At the end of the film, I hoped mightily the Enterprise would burn up in Earth's atmosphere, take all its hyperactive characters with it, and end this series so Gene Rodenberry could rest peacefully in his grave.  I doubt I'll get my wish, but I won't waste time watching the inevitable third installment.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Like it very much. You need to try it out! You will never worry about being late again. I really enjoy the setting options.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I've been a fan since 1987 and this is the best by far of all and it keep getting better with into darkness. It's amazing, can't wait for the next one. I've seen both five times allready and I'm ready for more.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Superb. Seen it five times in theaters and I'm waiting for my blueray, to watch over and over again and again.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is one of the best zombie movies/series I've seen (Zombieland rocks too!). But, you want to hear about the quality of the product: Perfect.

B005LAIIN0|1.0|This pathetic movie is based on the premise that Anthropogenic Global Warming is more than an elaborate hoax. And if you refuse to fall in lie and join the \\"Church of Man Is Destroying the World\\" (The End is Nigh!) then you will turn into a zombie and eat brains or die. Infantile. Not worth your time.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|Graphics cool, concept cool, actual play- meh.  It was the FAOTD so I'm not bummed there.  Just not as enjoyable as I had hoped.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Long, different, but still compelling. Bothersome to me was the fact they tried to modernize a 1920's era story with jay-z music and club style dancing. I mean, really? Almost a drug-induced film depiction. Loved the book, movie was just....OK. DiCaprio was great as usual, and other guy was his usual self haha
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it! Season 3 was very entertaining. I was addicted all season. I think season 1 is still the best season but I was still entertained.
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|\\"Liquid Spirit\\" is the marvelous Grammy-nominated third recording (and first on Blue Note) by singer, composer, actor, and leader Gregory Porter, who gives a masterful performance of 11 original songs and 3 standards, keeping up the momentum of his preceding recordings: [[ASIN:B003D5X3VM Water]] and [[ASIN:B006OE7XM4 Be Good]]. Some singers only interpret the music of others, but Porter has the ability to uniquely see the world and then express his own viewpoints through potent lyrics that occur 'organically', a booming expressive baritone voice, and his musical group. He is accompanied by his long-time associates: Chip Crawford on piano, Aaron James on bass, Emanuel Harrold on drums, Tivon Pennicott on tenor sax, Yosuke Sato on alto sax, and Curtis Taylor on trumpet. When performing, Porter always wears his distinctive 2-piece Kangol hat and balaclava headgear.<br /><br />The `best of the best' on this recording begins with the gospel-tinged Grammy-nominated song \\"Liquid Water\\", which is driven along by hand-claps, grooving horns, James' bass figurations, and Chip Crawford's staccato piano funk. The powerful Max Roach-Abbey Lincoln gem \\"Lonesome Lover\\" is marvelous, pushed along in 4/4 swing with a 6/8 vamp with a hot Yosuke Sato alto solo. \\"Hey Laura\\" and \\"Brown Grass\\" are ballads that intensely lay out the story of troubled romances gone wrong. The very hip, bluesy \\"Free\\" and \\"Movin'\\" are autobiographical marvels showing the positive influence of family on Porter and show his backup group at its best. The engaging \\"now and forever' theme of \\"Wind Song\\" is propelled along nicely by Harrold's drums, James' bass, and Crawford's sparkling piano. The beautiful 'fairy tale'-like ballad \\"When Love Was King\\" is dedicated to Porter's new son and the world he wants to raise him in, getting a very emotional performance. \\"Musical Genocide\\" has Porter effectively exhorting the timely theme of getting back to the basics of music appreciation. And perhaps best of all, the stunning \\"I Fall In Love Too Easily\\" gets a tender and passionate reading from Porter using his entire baritone range, backed by only by the rhythm section and with a marvelous Crawford piano solo. Of special mention throughout are the pianistic fireworks and shadings of pianist Chip Crawford and the saxophone soloists, who all interact wonderfully with Porter here as in live performances. Produced by Brian Bacchus, \\"Liquid Spirit\\" is a marvelous recording showing why Greg Porter, hailed as one of the first-rank jazz singers of the day, is also a prolific poet/lyricist backed by a spirited group that brings the music to life. Highly Recommended. Five FABULOUS Stars!

B004UJAOLM|5.0|It took me a minute to get into this book, but I'm glad I didn't give up! It was so good! I'm repulsed by Heathcliff, though I felt sorry for him at first. Jealousy turned him into a monster!!
B000WYCF6Q|3.0|Have moved this several places on my handlebars to try and get it where a simple downward look will reveal what's behind. On curved handlebars the only place I've found that it's not totally in the way of a hand grip is on the bottom inside. THis makes it difficult to see without moving my leg to the inside so as to see around it to the rear. Image is good .
B00COQKE2M|2.0|Dying is Your Latest Fashion is one of my favorite albums of all times, and Ronnie is what makes it special. This theory was made fact when The Drug in Me is You first came out providing a little touch of the old Escape the Fate along with a little something else. Unfortunately, this \\"something else\\" has grown, and that's not a good thing. The something I'm referring to is Ronnie's ego which plagued The Drug in Me is You, especially in Tragic Magic. But enough about the past, let's talk present. Slap on this album and I think \\"huh, this isn't that bad... Yeah I could get into this!\\" And then he starts rapping and my heart drops. To make matters worse, he'll say something stupid in his god awful \\"rhymes\\" and my heart falls. (in reverse lol) And unfortunately, that's how it is every song (except for bad girl's club, I practically hunched over crying when I heard that one) Always starts strong, ends distasteful. Naturally, they're not all like this. Love Fashionably Late and Born to Lead is ok, other then that they're just as I said, good until the breakdown. Really don't care if the style is different, I just can't stand Ronnie's terrible rapping; it's so basic. Find it fitting to end this review on a sole point: I miss the old Ronnie.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I missed seeing this episode last spring and with the new season coming soon I wanted to catch up. It was a great episode, as most NCIS are...I loved being able to 'search' for what I needed to see, rather than 'hope' it was going to be recorded on my DVR.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I purchased these to replace my old wireless headphones (Creative) that broke, my main use is music (almost thruout the whole work day), occasional videoconferencing and random gaming.<br /><br />My initial impression of these headphones was that they looked flimsy and ugly, but upon closer inspection and first use I was quite impressed. My previous wireless headphones snapped in half from their plastic headband adjustment mechanism, the G930 has this weak spot made of metal so this should not be an issue with these.<br />The headphones are much lighter than what I'm used to and sometimes I even forget I'm wearing them. Signal strength is excellent, I'm yet to hear any noise/static while moving around my apartment. A lot of people complained occasional loss of signal but I haven't experienced any of this.<br />I'm not much of an audiophile so I won't comment the sound quality any further than that I have absolutely no complaints, the headphones sound very good and compared to my old headphones I don't hear a lot of difference. These headphones seem to suppress outside noise little better which helps. Audio quality during video conferencing was a pleasant surprise, I was able to hear the people a lot better (which may be due to better outside noise suppression).<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - lightweight<br /> - comfortable<br /> - volume adjust is a scrollwheel instead of buttons, easy to locate and use<br /> - ear cups are large enough to not press on your ears<br /> - charging cord is microusb type so it can be used with phones, tablets etc<br /> - charging cord also works as single slot USB hub<br /> - excellent signal, I can move around my apartment freely without hearing a single crackle<br /> - microphone has has a red mute warning light<br /> - microphone can be folded up which also mutes it<br /> - 3 programmable keys<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - not a big fan of the looks, but then again I didn't buy these to look at them<br /> - charging cord is microusb type so itcan be a pain to plug in without removing headphones<br /> - microphone not detachable<br /><br />edit 10/28/2013:<br />I had to remove one star because the volume control wheel seems to stop working at random after a period of use, problem can be fixed temporarily by powercycling the headset so it's not the end of the world but still very annoying. I sent my headset back to Logitech for replacement because of this and after roughly 1.5 weeks I received a new one, but the problem still existed so I'm just going to assume it's here to stay.
