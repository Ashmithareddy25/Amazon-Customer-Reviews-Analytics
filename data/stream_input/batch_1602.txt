B002MQYOFW|5.0|I  am usually not a fan of trilogies, but this was an exception and I am looking forward to reading the sequel.
B005DNOAQY|5.0|I saw this film when it was first released and remembered how funny it was. Certain scenes never left my mind, bringing smiles after so many years. How wonderful to see it again. Woody's matchless timing, self-deprecating style and comedic skill come together seamlessly, making you think you are watching hysterical collisions of mind and matter. Be grateful that LP record albums were in use at the time or you would miss my favorite, brilliantly executed bit. The same can be said for telephones at the time. Who would have thought that they--and their numbers--could be the stars of a running gag? If there is a prerequisite to viewing this movie, it would probably be to see [[ASIN:B001EBWING Casablanca]] first.
078322804X|5.0|What to say about this piece of story?<br />One of the masterpieces of John Landis<br />Beautiful music, fantastic actors, I love it!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I ordered this item via kindle and I love it.  I installed it on my iPhone and can read anytime I am waiting or wherever I am because of convenience.  I wish I would have done it a long time ago.
B007F7XXKA|4.0|The book carries us from past to present and shows the mirror of tomorrow. A good analysis of how great nations are created and how fragile a good economy could be. All Governments should read it, if they want to grow!As for students of economics, they must!
B0083GQKQG|3.0|It was a truly art house bizarre movie where you aren't sure if the mother is just as psycho as the son.  Yet, as weird as it was, I couldn't stop watching it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the Best Book of the entire Series!!! It was so worth buying and putting on my Kindle Fire!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Although the book is written in an interesting fashion ,i.e. the switch in each chapter of the 1st person of the 2 main characters, the ending of the book defies logic and spoils the read.
B008602KQI|5.0|in these days this picture remember the actual reality, maybe taken to an extreme modus but there wil be the possibility of near future fact
B008602KQI|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Acting and scenery were well done. Stayed true to the book for the most part. Looking forward to the next movie in the series.
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|This is a mediocre simulation of some of the old school RPG games I grew up on.  Ok, but not great.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the best place to put everything you want to keep track of ever. Access everything from any device you own - on-line via a web browser or off-line on your laptop. Searched everything including your PDF's (if you pay $50 a year). Snip web pages you want to view later, draw diagrams on a tablet computer with pen. I use Lenovo 1838 with the digitizer pen. Free to start out so you have nothing to loose. If you don't need a lot os storage per month or search functions or to lock your application on a laptop no need to pay. I've been using applications like this for 20 years. This has the best set of features and local/cloud access of any solution I've tried so far. I personally don't store any passwords or personal data though Evernote website discussion says they use the strongest exportable encryption allowed by the US Govt. They go on to say that they'd like to change that if they had the horsepower etc. to do so. Give it a try and see if it is right for your needs.
B008602KQI|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie and I fully realize that movies never tell it the way book lovers see it.  However, way too much background is left out, such as why hunting, her father and mother's story, 3 days and nights in the cave, Madge,the Hob, the Prep team, etc.  Therefore, it just seemed to jump from one scene to the next.
B00932A5QA|3.0|I love cheezy bug movies. A fourth movie on starship troopers - had to watch it.  After the first 10 seconds I detected that this was going to be an all CGI movie, and almost turned it off.  It was obviously created with a gaming engine - and the whole film is like one big in-game cut scene.<br /><br />You do get to see some of the old cast - Johnny Rico is a general now, Carmen is still a ship captain, and Carl is the king of psy-ops or something.  Plot wise it is about as good as the first movie - so if you are a real fan, and you don't mind watching upscale CGI, you will probably enjoy the movie.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This point-and-click game had a lot of funny and interesting puzzles the graphics are beautiful. It could have been longer, but this was well worth the 99 cents and if you like it and would like more, there is the next game \\"[[ASIN:B0073LWEXK The Lost City]]\\" which is longer and more complicated.<br />This played without a hitch on my Nexus 7.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect. It was a great story that filled in a lot of blank areas from the trilogy
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Need  I say  more?  If you are a fan of the  show , get this  set.  I Love the show  &  could  watch these  over  & over.  No problems at all w/the  DVD's.
B003B02OOG|5.0|These short stories are a fast read.  At times I laughed and others I was in suspense.  This style of writing is a great departure from Grisham's other books.  I recommend it highly.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Excellent, obvious and yet powerful, as some of the best books are. Have personally overcome two habits since reading this.
B001MBK3T4|4.0|I first heard this when I was 15 on vinyl through headphones connected to a vacuum-tube stereo...it changed forever my views of what \\"heavy\\" sounds like.  From the first high-hats on \\"Turn Up the Night,\\" followed by that thumping \\"chuck-chuck\\" of Iommi's SG copy, I was hooked.  Great stuff, and this album is for the most part all of a tone.  Thanks to Dio's lyrics and singing, it is rather sinister throughout; if, like me, you felt this album was vaguely satanic, it was by design.  Beyond that, the guitar tones are wonderful:  harsh, stinging, feral, and just beautifully distorted and chunky.  I think the smaller scale length of the Gibson-style instruments reduces the harmonic overtones and really leaves you a lot of fundamental note; sending that vibrating over mahogany and through tubes, it's beauty incarnate.<br /><br />Dio's singing is overblown and operatic at times; I love it.  Lyrics are so serious, something appealing to that teenage part of my brain.  The only weak spot is \\"Over and Over.\\"  Skip after one listen (but still, Iommi's twisty leads are terrific and refreshing), and enjoy scary Satan implications like \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\" (which would be, I assume, and upside-down cross, fairly Lucifer-ous).  Geezer's bass is phased on this song, which he also does live.  Appice's drumming is wonderful and (sorry to say again) heavy throughout.  Great songs and performances, coupled with the scary cover, make this a masterpiece of late-70s - early 80's metal.  The wah-wah on \\"Turn Up the Night\\" also sounds particularly evil, even though it's a major key song.  This is a success.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|It is entertaining but unreal the warped mind that he had from being abused.  Difficult if you would fall in love with someone such as this!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|i so thoroughly enjoyed this book!  i was actually sad when it ended!  i really had forgotten what an excellent writer stephen king is, as i hadn't read a book of his in probably 20 years.  i just couldn't put it down as i became completely swept away in the story, the characters, and in not being able to figure out how it would end.  the 'retro' setting of 1958-1963 was so well-researched and was like a stroll down memory lane for this baby-boomer.  and like so many of us, i remember exactly where i was and what i was doing when i heard that kennedy had been shot.  really up until the last second, i had no idea how this would turn out - bittersweet, but wonderful.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I know that Book 4  k in this series was a bridge book but I was sort of discouraged and hesitated to start reading 5.  It is as exciting as book 3 in the series.  I know when I hit the end of this I will be on pins and needles waiting for Book 6 to be published. There is just one surprise after the other and I am not giving out any spoiler hints.  It was way too much fun reading something and going WHAT!
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Kids love this movie and really like the story, plus a world of talking cars. Adults can say its a kids movie but still end up watching it and enjoying it as well.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I loved it, one of the best books I have read(in this genre).Down to the point,with a very clear message.Highly recommend it.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Enjoyable, light read, esp. if you're a Fey fan but even if you're not, she tells her stories in an entertaining way.
B0016LTNL4|4.0|Entertaining, funny and would recommend for light hearted, silly entertainment. Great British comedy, obsurd, but easy to follow and great acting.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|The Pines was a fun read.  You felt so bad for the poor guy who led you through the story--he took beating after beating but kept on going.  Every time I thought I had this story figured out, it went another level deeper.  I thought it was a really good book.
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater and loved it!  The books were phenomenal and the movie stayed pretty true to the book.  Since I have an \\"at home\\" theater, I tried out the movie with 3-D & surround sound and it was AWESOME.  Better than in the theater, if that is possible.  Anxiously awaiting the sequels!
B003V1WTMM|4.0|This is the third book that I have read by Kate Morton and found them to be all a good story line with lots of fore shadowing and good plots.  I thought that I had figured out part of the mystery about the sisters and then discovered another line of possibilities to the mystery.  I like the fact that there was no cussing, or sexual discriptions of  realationships between characters.  It is a good story not to long but just long enought to hold your interest and make you want to hurry up to the finish.  I would tell any of my friends to read this book, or the other books by Kate Morton that I have read,  Forgotten Garden, and The House At Riverton.
B008602KQI|5.0|\\"Hunger Games\\" is something of an odd fit, both as a novel and a movie. I was introduced to the novel by my adult, PhD-candidate daughter, who said the book was marketed as a juvenile novel but that I would find it anything but juvenile. She was correct: the writing is riveting. And I promptly read the next two novels.<br /><br />When the movie came out, I had doubts. The novel is intensely personal, so there are no grand, overarching vistas, and the reader never knows more than the first person narrator. In a film, you can't get into a character's head quite that easily, unless you want to try the god-like narrator approach, constantly talking over the action. The director wisely chose to ditch the god-like narrator, and instead you have a number of scenes not in the book, where characters manage to both increase the level of tension and drama and at the same time fill in some gaps based on knowledge not known to the main protagonist. This is done with a gentle touch; even a careful reader of the novels will not feel the story was violated.<br /><br />The special features on the disc help explain some of the choices in how the book was turned into a film, especially an amazing letter by Donald Sutherland, explaining his understanding of President Snow, the chief villain in the series.<br /><br />In short, this is an excellent film based on an excellent book. Don't overlook the \\"special features\\" as they are, for a change, special.<br /><br />I can hardly wait to see what they do with the next two books.
B008IYR2BA|3.0|This season was only okay for me. The story seemed to kind of meander a little bit, which I think was a product of it originally being the last season, and then finding out it wasn't so they had to figure out ways to not wrap up the story quite yet. Still good, still Dexter. Here's to hoping for a great last season.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|I have read this book twice, before and after Barack became President. I have been greatly impress both times.The first one because I was able to know about his life and to find out who he was. The second reading reaffirmed my impresions of of a man of firm convictions who is fghting against adversity and succeeding. As President he has stablished the bases for programs that will help the people of The United States and the upcomming generations. He is the corageous architect of reforms knowing the political liability that they carried, this is a reflection of a man of integrity who is swimming against the current keeping afloat his principles. The book Dreams From My Father helps the reader become familiar with his great personality. Marco Cáceres MD
B002APU580|5.0|The acting was suburb. The costumes and scenery were wonderful. Let's face it, I LOVE English drama and try to view all things English. Waiting for the 3rd season of Downton Abby.
B007OY64C8|5.0|Westerns are not my favorite genre, but Tombstone is great.  Acting, pacing, cinematography, dialogue all great.  \\"I'm your huckleberry\\" --- cracks me up.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|guys this boook is amazing!! i love the ending and so will you. hope u do love it as much as me!! buy it on kindle!!!!!!!!!!!
B008602KQI|2.0|the movie was o.k.  I thought there would have been a little more \\"umph\\" to it considering all the hype up to its release.  It kind of moved slow.  The first half was good but then it started to get slow and I did not like where it was going.  I hear the the book is way better but I do not like to read so I personally cannot tell you that.  It could be the director of the movie that made it seem like it was drawn out.  They say there is going to be a part 2, and part 3 to this but I most likely will not watch them.
B006886LCE|5.0|This is the real deal folks.  How things were really working over there.  Amazing how despite the total lack of proper planning and doing a war on the cheap by the Bush administration our enlisted troops and junior officers prevailed.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have watched this movie 4 times - this is the only movie I can say that about in my life. I highly recommend this movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book pulls you in because it is conflicting and only resolves near the end. While I wasn't that happy with the way it ended the ending made sense after thinking about it. If you like a mystery with a lot of character study, this is a good book for you. My understanding is that a movie is being made. Always best to read the book first!
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Got this as the free app of the day, although if I'd known how good it is I would have just paid the small amount that it normally costs.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Final installment really let's down the series. Comes across as following the old mills and boon formula. Very hard to believe that such characters could suddenly conform to the happily every after with 2 kids scenario. Would have liked a bit more stark reality something more in line with book number 1
B008JH5CVS|3.0|The movie was okay. Plot wasn't that gripping, but the action was enough to keep you interested. the hero is questionable because it's hard to decide if you like him or not.
B003DFLZB2|5.0|Hans Zimmer's score seems IMO to be a dynamic blend of sentimentality (representing Bruce's troubled past, and his feelings for Rachel); powerful, driving music for the fighting scenes (Molossus is my favorite track on this album); with a hint of mysteriousness (as seen with the Scarecrow scenes and when Batman blends into the darkness). I can't think of any BAD scores written by Hans Zimmer. This is definitely a must have for the Christopher Nolan Batman fan.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was the best book of the grey trilogy..it gave u more than just whips & chains..it actually had a plot & storyline. Honestly I started reading the book cuz of all the hype but it wasn't the best books I've read..I mean how much sex can one person have?!!! The first book had me like ok really?!!! Nextttt!!! Lol but nonetheless it wasn't the worst trilogy I've read just a bit unrealistic, however I did enjoy the happy ending in this last book :)
B00884GR0W|1.0|It says there is an error and so the game will not install on my kindle fire. Sad to waste $5, but I will update my review if this error is fixed.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|Lots of action not much substance.  Was kind of lame in its subject matter.  If you want ction with no thinking, then this will do.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very easy app to use with lots of options.<br />I would have willingly paid for this game but yea it was free.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I could not put my Kindle down.  Absolutely loved it.  The way the author brought witches, vampires and deamons together was really well written.  I have already purchased her next book Shadows of Night.
B007SGM084|5.0|I heard so much about Fifty Shades that I had to pick it up. Well lets just say I have not put the book down since opening the first page. I would rather read my trilogy pages than read my homework. I was not sure how things were going to turn out but I am so happy this book kept my interest.
B001P7HUF0|4.0|I had to watch this movie for my Torts I class and it was very enjoyable.  The characters are memorable.  Matt Damon does a great job as the young attorney fresh out of law school and is very believable.  I would recommend for anyone who enjoys John Grisham or legal thrillers!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a page turner! When you think you have figured out what is going on, you are not right...and it happens more than once. One of the best books I have read recently.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a wonderful book, kept me turning the pages to the end. I thought it told a lot about relationships and how people react differently. I loved the way it worked through them as the story went along.
B00598XVA4|5.0|Iron Maiden is one of the BEST metal bands of all time!! Still touring, still producing albums, STILL ROCKIN'!! This is one of the first albums I ever bought and can never get enough.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|This was the third book authored by Sedaris that I have read.  They are all higly enjoyable.  Very few authors can make me laugh out loud while I am reading.  He is certainly one of them.  As soon as I finished this book I ordered another one for my kindle.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Really do like this app.  Ordered the free version then the paid version which offers many more sounds.  Only two things I do not like about the product: navigation could have been explained, and some of the sound bits are too short.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Sensationally bad, but obviously a great way to sell books and make money for the author and publishers....and the book sellers. Nothing in the book was enlightening for me.  I've known about or experienced most of the scenes in the book - even the abuse.  This is not entertaining reading, especially for the high percentage of women on this planet who are abused on a daily basis by men who think women are only there to be used as objects for their sole pleasure.  I read the book to find out what all the fuss was about. Obviously a lot of woman (and men) out there are very naive and probably thought the book was 'enlightening' in a sexual way.  Maybe it gave them some new ways to make their relationships more exciting; to rekindle their passion.  There are plenty of other books out there to provide 'stimulating' sex education.  I have no idea why this book (and the others written by the same author) is so popular.  I think it should be banned.  Abuse in a sexual relationship, without consent, is wrong....even if it is supposed to be fiction. I have no intention of reading the remaining 'Shades of Grey' books.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|in the beginning and middle of the film, it was really funny and had some great scenes. but at the end it got a bit serious and the laughs completely died down. channing tatum did a great job proving he is not just a pretty face and was really funny!! still cute. the cameo from johnny depp totally stole the ending.
B0080BFVPU|1.0|This was one of the shoddiest transfers I've seen lately. The back cover boasts of an 'astonishing remaster' which, basically, consists of your garden-variety noise reduction, artificial sharpening and edge enhancement. Detail in most scenes (even closeups) is scarce. Some scenes look as if they were lifted from the (not exactly stellar) DVD. Usually even below-par releases have at least some redeeming quality to them, but unfortunately not in this case as far as the picture quality is concerned. The blandness of the image is perhaps what Walt Disney Home Video means by 'astonishing'.<br /><br />I bought this together with High Fidelity (which, *thankfully*, is a fairly decent and strong-looking release)<br /><br />Also let me talk a bit about the extras. Wait! There are none. Not even a trailer. The astonishment continues.<br /><br />The only aspect I would give somewhat high marks for on this disc is the audio, as they have actually managed to not screw this up along with everything else. But all in all this made for some very poor treatment of what I consider to be a unique classic from the period. Shame on you Disney for treating your customers this way.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie!  This was the first time I saw it, I did not go to the theater to see it.  The Blu-ray has lots of extras and if you have BD Live, you can get even more.  Also, I was able to load the digital copy on to my laptop and can watch it there any time I like!  So that is cool, especially if I am travelling.
B000ME5B30|5.0|Thanks to Gore and others, the dots were connected years ago and still people are denying, dragging their feet and sticking their heads in the sand.  Well, good luck to the future generations.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book (and the other two) make up such a great love story. The bonus is that its full of jaw dropping moments! ;)
B00884GR0W|3.0|castel miner z is what i think of this game lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol
B006BAEQB2|3.0|Another view of the era from another window. A resonable read and interesting to a point, but if you have read the preceding books, then there are no real surprises in the facts and characters.<br />However, the book does present a more sympathetic view of Richard than the traditional Shakespeare image (Paul Kendal would be proud of her).<br />What we really need is a good HistroFiction book on Warwick himself.
0060899190|5.0|This book was well-packaged and in excellent condition..  I would gladly order from here again.  Some of the secrets make you want to laugh and some make you want to cry, but it is great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. I laughed out loud so many times. I can highly recommend it! I'm looking forward to more novels by this author.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|This world needs more of Milton Friedman's wisdom and common sense. I only wish he was still alive today so he could help spread the news about capitalism and freedom and how essential they are to each and every American, whether or not they realize or recognize it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The entire book is great, but the end makes this a true piece of literature and mindblowing! Cannot wait to see the movie!
B007X1ZQSU|5.0|one of the very good bands finally gets a proper \\"deal\\"... which sound really good, all are recent remasters.<br />But do not forget their fantastic 1st.album!! It is better then you think, together with the \\"Wagabounds of western world\\", they are more then classics, the are esentials...
B008MEM24S|5.0|Works and runs great. Just like were's my water.  Hope for new levels soon. As far as $.99 games go I feel I would have a hard time getting a better deal.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just like my kids can spend many hours playing these games totally recommend it if you want to keep yourself entertained. :)
B008F5YDRI|4.0|A movie certainly worth viewing.  I liked it a lot....the ending was predictable but that didn't matter.  It's a feel good movie.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I don't really read much, but I decided to buy this book. And I could not put it down!!! It is a book that you need to purchase!!! It grabbed my attention from the first page. Great read, even though it is sad.
B000I9S64U|4.0|There are plenty of problems with this movie, but if you can ignore the fact that it is based on the greatest work of scifi of all time you can have a pretty decent time with it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app rocks on the DROID. No bugs that I've found. Makes looking at Pinterest so easy.  Love all the recipes & DIY ideas.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Was one of his better ones.  The story kept on moving but there was only Blue Man and her so the list wasn't large.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using Pinterest and love that i can use it now on my phone and kindle fire. It is a fun app that gives you great ideas!
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This story is both heart warming and heart breaking.  I certainly makes you think about your own life and how you may want to live it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is addicting. Great fun. I can play it for hours. This is one game i would pay for.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book held me until the end.  I loved all the plot twists and never really knowing the real deal.  However, the end is awful.
B003MS0UHU|5.0|I have been a fan of Ice Age movies from the start.  I heard lackluster reviews of this movie so my expectation were low.  I watched it with my daughter on a day she was home sick.  We loved the movie!  The true meaning of family and friendship reigns again with these prehistoric characters.  Who knew we'd get so attached to the terrifying T-Rex mother.  We watched the movie 3 times that week.  Absolutely fun and adorable.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I would recommend this series. It is a good story. You just end up skipping some of the romance to get to the actual story.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Read this after I finished Gone Girl. I have no idea how the author comes up with such disturbing stories, but once started, you can't put this book down! After this one, I immediately went on to read her 3rd book. Now, it's time for some light, fluffy reading to recover. But, I'll be first in line to buy her next book!
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" last Spring, so I had a good bit of trepidation when I finally decided to watch the movie. Why ruin a good thing ... I was so thrilled to watch the book virtually come to life in front of my eyes. This is a tale well told, played out on the screen in excellent performances, great cinematography, and a screenplay that was true to the original tale.<br /><br />Now that I am trusting of the treatment of the story, I am hungry for the next installments.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The likeability quotient was missing in \\"Gone Girl\\"<br />along with the disappearance of the main character.<br />It is still an OK summer read.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I liked all of this series, but there was a little too much of one thing.  The story is great, if you skip past some of the romance.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Very enjoyable. Well written. Craig is very honest about himself and not mean spirited about the people who have passed through his life.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would highly recommend Gone Girl. The twists kept me hooked. Gillian Flynn<br />has me as new fan. I was looking forward to another great read, so immediately ordered Sharp Objects.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|My husband recommended i read this book because the table of contents mirrored a lot of questions that i had been asking. I'm so glad i picked it up.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Kerr has a wonderful character trying to live in a very bad time.  He is a confoformist in a very conforming society.  The Berlin slang is wonderful.
B00122HT04|4.0|I've had this album since '07 that I got from somewhere else but liked it so much I decided to buy it again through the mp3 site. Solid metal album with some other elements that make it interesting. Scream, Afterlife, Brompton Cocktail, and Dear God are album highlights.
B004XS97QS|5.0|This is the 2nd season/series of the rebooted Doctor Who featuring Matt Smith as the 11th Doctor, and he does not disappoint in the slightest.  Very impressive acting and the character has a feeling of being very genuine and very authentic.  The show continues to thrive and is both fun and entertaining to watch, and some of the stories, while outwardly entertaining, also really make you think about things in ways you otherwise might have overlooked - which I feel is true of several seasons/series of Doctor Who - but it certainly continues in this one.  This year again featured the Ponds, Amy and Rory as The Doctor's companions.  Excellent special effects as usual and great writing, but superb acting, especially by Matt Smith.  Matt Smith may have been the only person who could have adequately followed David Tennant's 10th Doctor in the iconic and legendary role.  I am truly impressed with how good this program is and I highly recommend it to anyone.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Excellent and fresh approach to a zombie apocolypse.  I just hope the movie they are trying to make will be as good as the book.  Not holding my breath though.
B003F5NSTW|4.0|I was reading the book but had to leave it behind at my host's house so downloaded it to my Kindle for the plane journey as I couldn't put the book down.
B008602KQI|5.0|I am an avid reader and am always wary of the movie adaptations of books.  There always seems to be some major story plot that ended up on the floor rather than the movie, or for time sake, the movie is too compressed, or you need to read the book to understand the movie.  More often than not I am finding it hard to watch movies after I read the book, but this is not the case with The Hunger Games.<br /><br />This movie creates a thrilling theatrical event with a happy mix of edge of your seat suspense and calm reflective moments. Very well done indeed and stayed true to the book but can stand alone as well.  The use of CG with the natural environment was very well done and did not seem forced as sometimes happens.  One of my all-time top movies.<br /><br />The only thing that was a negative was the amount of \\"shaky camera\\" during the scenes.  I don't mind some but this movie toes the line a being excessive.  That being said, it does add to the movie vibe and helps set many scenes.<br /><br />The other thing is you need to know is, watch this movie before your pre-teens.  The underlying theme is not suitable for the younger audience.  This movie takes maturity to fully grasp.
B003KLGKAA|5.0|One word sums it up: Wow!<br /><br />David Tennant gives us an unparalleled performance as The Doctor.  This was his final series/season of Doctor Who and it's packed chock full of goodness.  Great story lines combined with Tennant as the tenth incarnation of everyone's favorite timelord are truly phenomenal.  After watching every episode featuring him in the coveted role, I must confess I was brought to tears and had grown very attached.  He brought a youthful excitedness and playfulness to the character but also a deadly seriousness and sense of the massive responsibility being the last of the timelords carried.  This was amazingly well made television and any fan of Doctor Who would be both moved and deeply impressed by it.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|For a long time I attempted to rent the \\"limited edition\\" of this movie but it was always checked out. That edition included some previously \\"cut\\" scenes and this disk includes both the original edition and the limited edition. The additional footage was worth waiting for.
B008602KQI|4.0|When watching this movie, if you've read the books, you definately need to see it as a different entity.  While I like the books better, I also enjoy the movie.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was very well done. Each time I watch it I see more details from the book. It was nice being able to watch it on my iPad before the blueray dvd arrived.
B003HYSSZK|5.0|I think Matt Smith did an amazing job, far better than almost anyone could have imagined, in filling the shoes of The Doctor - and not just filling them - *being* The Doctor, making the role his own but staying true to what makes The Doctor \\"The Doctor.\\"  He is witty, playful, child like in some ways in his wonder about things and his fascination at  things. He can also be quite serious and grim.  You see a whole range of sides to the character.  Smith was, in my opinion, positively the right person to cast in the role to follow David Tennant's 10th Doctor (what a tough act to follow!).  The show continues to impress and is fun and entertaining to watch, and some of the episodes, while entertaining, also really make you think about things in a way you otherwise might have overlooked.  The 11th Doctor (Matt Smith) shall not disappoint!  Amelia Pond is also a great companion in series 6 of the reboot of Doctor Who, and adds a great element to the show.  (Love her Scottish accent and she is quite, shall we say, fashionable).  If you are a Doctor Who fan, this series will not disappoint.
0307730697|5.0|Very Sad True Story of Adam Brown worth the read! Its more then the fighting that goes with a seal its the trials and everything he overcame to become a Hero truly fearless!
B000OW77UU|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.  I can narrow it down to a Top 3, basically.<br /><br />This is the true story of a man coming from poverty determined to find happiness for himself and his son. This movie is about life and it's ups and downs.  Someone who saw an opportunity and didn't give up on it.  Someone that knew they had something to offer and didn't accept having a life of unhappiness because he didn't have everything given to him from the stats.<br /><br />Excellent movie.  I love everything about it!<br /><br />I put down this and Rocky as two of the best movies I've ever seen, among others.  Enjoy
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think this book was exciting to read. The storie was well written and engaging and something that is generally a dirty secret...
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|Christopher Eccleston played the 9th Doctor in this reboot of the historic Doctor Who television show.  It had been several years since they'd stopped making new episodes of Doctor Who by the time this new incarnation of the program came out.  The 9th was my first Doctor, and succeeded in getting me \\"hooked\\" on Doctor Who.  Although Eccleston only did one series/season of Doctor Who, it was a good one and had some compelling stories and introduced viewers to Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) who would go on to remain the 10th Doctor's (David Tennant) companion the next series/season.  There are all sorts of fascinating adventures to be had in this year's episodes and it's the only place a person should start when watching the new Doctor Who reboot.  Starting with this year's show, someone who had never seen any Doctor Who previously would be able to feel comfortable and start learning about everything that makes Doctor Who what it is and why it's so great.  As for Eccleston's performance, I felt that he did a fine job and brought a unique persona to the role of The Doctor.  He has a buzz cut hairdo, he wears a black leather jacket, and he has both playful and serious qualities to his character.  I think he did a fine job and wish he'd done a few more seasons/series of Doctor Who.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great place to start watching Doctor Who, this is it.
B003KHMX32|5.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\" is the best written show on television.  It is smart, scary, horrible, wonderful, hilarious and heart wrenching and we just cannot get enough of this fabulous, modern version of Greek tragedy.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|This book is not very complex. The characters are simple and the story line is predictable. Just another vampire romance
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie and I'm waiting on the other two books to be put to movies.  There are things in the movie I liked better than the book.  And, of course, there are things I liked better in the book.  The movie means more if the books are first read as the books have more depth to them.  However, I've watched the movie a few times and it never gets boring.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|if you do not want to think too much while watching a movie and just want to watch something for entertainment, this movie is a good choice.<br />good action movie to watch over the weekend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was very skeptical to read this trilogy because of the controversy I had heard from other people. HOWEVER, I must say, it was was an awesome experience. I'm not a novel, romance kinda book reader, more an informational, health/fitness kind of reader. So I was surprised this kept my attention. It is written very well with great attention to detail. No wonder most men have a hard time with this book, which is a shame. I hope there are additional sequels to come.
B002BGA7WM|5.0|This has some fantastic music on it! Im a huge fan of MUSE. What I thought was really great about the download though was how easy it was and the cloud music player!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|It was Fun, funny and Uplifting to watch, we enjoyed it very much, light hearted. Good for all ages. Recommended watch!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was an awesome trilogy! Kinda reminds you what might be missing in your relationship. Would definitely read it again!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is by far the best trilogy I've read in quite a while. I think the writing was superb and the overall storyline was very well executed by the author. Can't wait to see what's next!!
B005723JSQ|4.0|this was last months selection for our book club- we all really enjoyed the book!  I have been a fan of Sophie Kinsella since Shopaholoic, so I was very excited to read this one.  It definitely kept me up way past my bed time reading \\"one more chapter\\"
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The Hunger Games was entertaining, I like Sci Fi, but it didn't live up to all the hype that was given it.  I'm happy I waited for it to come on Pay Per View.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book based on the subject matter. The idea of kids killing eachother was really disturbing. When I finally did pick it up, I couldn't put it down. I read all 3 books in a week and a half. Highly recommended!
B007NCSQFO|1.0|I brought the album for two songs the rest weren't so good in my opinion. I think she could of did a whole lot better like the first album.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|This was one of the best books.  Extremely clever.  Sold me on continuing to read this series with Detective Gunther.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Very good quick source for news and interesting info. I can spend time just fliping though the news blips. I think it is a great source.
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first I could not get into this book but once you past the first 100 pages its a great read and cannot put down.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Quick and entertaining read of a classic pirate story.  I finally read this well into my adulthood, and am surprised to hear how many read it as a child given the complex use of pirate lingo.  It's an adventure children will enjoy, but there are also many nuances that will likely only be appreciated by more mature readers.  Overall, really enjoyed it, and had no issues with the Kindle version.
B001AITGWE|4.0|crisp,well written,solid plot line.surely he would've gone to jail for killing the nazi, but didn't devolve(the story)into  orge of senseless violence as so many other movies of that genre have.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I have been a fan for a long time and this album does not disappoint. From their very first EP to now, I am still amazed how this band makes me feel inside. I am Monster and Man.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|The DVD would not play in my Pioneer Blu Ray player....was part of a \\"bad batch\\" I'm gathering....bought a second one at Target and had the same response.
B008602KQI|4.0|Hunger game's is one of the best movies I viewed on Blu-ray this year. The picture quality and surround sound is great. The colors, the environment, the feeling and various moods takes you into the movie, however there is still room for improvements. One thing to consider is that this movie was design to include a teenage audience, therefore it limits extreme conduct. To me, enough was done to make this a solid movie. The whole point in the movie shows various human characteristics from the best that we can be to the far worse. Katniss Everdeen, the hero displays a nature that most humans feel towards life no matter where we are from the best to worse political systems in this world. Generally we have a love for our family members and we share the moral concept of not wanting to harm others. One of the worse things in the world is seeing children being harmed. The plot in this story builds up to putting children in an arena, having them fight to the death. What is just as bad is brainwashing children to participate in these activities. If not one thing you can take from this movie is a message of humanity. In spite of the problems that exist in this world that has to be a better mean of finding a solution to our problems as oppose to murdering one another in sport.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I liked the book mainly because I was already hooked up with the story from the first three books of the Ice & Fire series and fallen in love with some of the main characters.  The previous book however had me a bit disappointed since the story fanned into several new characters leaving most of the dear ones behind.  A Dance With Dragons shows a comeback for Tyrion, Arya, Jon Snow, Daenerys  and some of the most interesting characters.<br />Martin's prose is always fluid and his imagination is fantastic so it is always easy to read whatever comes out of him, however, I sometimes wondered while reading \\"Dance..\\" if this particular story had acquired a life of its own and the author had been left behind trying to chase it all over the place.  It is clear that the intention is to let time pass until all the pieces fall into place and the different stories meet into a final great ending but the number of stories and characters keeps fanning out and multiplying, leaving several cliffhangers for the readers ... Who will have to wait 3, 4, 5 years to find out what happens ...  Oh well, like I said, he got me from book one, I' ll wait for him!
B006Y68ZYC|5.0|This is a great story.  It took me a couple of episodes to love it, but now I'm hooked.  I like how they tied all of the characters together.  It is very imaginative and something new from the ever-present monotony of crime series and reality TV!
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book was just too detailed, way too slow, skipped a lot of pages trying to get back to the \\"good\\" part.
B0077SGMXM|3.0|This app is pretty good but is not as reactive as I like. Some of the issue may be my screen protector not allowing all my moves to get to the app.
B004PV3M5A|4.0|If you like the smiths/cure 80s echo and the bunnymen kind of music you will probably like this band. Very consistent album to album. No bad music so far. Buy it. Enjoy it. Turn it up!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This is a good movie. Personally I rated it A+ plus. I cant wait till next one. Hope the next one b as good as this one. Excellent job!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|this book kept my attention from page 1 until the finish.  anyone interested in a good read with lots of twists and turns should read this one!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance with Dragons fills in parts of the timeline for characters that do not appear frequently in book four of the series and then takes off from there. It is a great continuation with twists and turns, unexpected alliances, treachery, and heroism. George R. R. Martin has an enormous ability to create and build upon characters that are believable and then to put the reader into their heads and/or see into their psyche. The reviewer found the book to move at a faster pace than some of the previous books in the series and, therefore, to be harder to put down at times. Another excellent book in an already epic and wonderful story arc.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I read this book some time ago, but I have not been able to get it out of my mind. It is a tremendously important book - one that every American should read. I reported on it for my book club and everyone found it as astonishing as I did. The book clearly shows the truth about living in a country where everything is provided by the government: home, clothes, food, education, job, etc. It should be a real eye-opener for anyone who believes government handouts are a good thing. As the great leader of North Korea gives with one hand, he takes with the other. More evidence that the United States is the best country in the world.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I love everysingle twilight saga movie a a super fan of these movies. I read the book love the way the r making it to the big screen. Way to go love sadly the next one is the last one.  :-(
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I loved the book.....read it over two days,could hardly keep it down.The only only negative if at all, is that there are far two many characters with foreign sounding names which makes it a bit confusing at times.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Great follow on enjoyed every page.Looking forward to the next one. Jeffrey Archer stories are always the best.Good Work .
B0030B624E|5.0|So...tho movie contains all the plot and great special effects that a movie like this needs...and then some. I haven't seen a Hollywood budget that didn't do zombies well yet. This one reminds me of the first Return of the Living dead. The perfect amount of gore, effects, plot, and most importantly laughs. It is a Zombie viewer must see!
B007SGM084|4.0|I found the Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle to be a very provocative series.  If you want something to read in between college text books, I highly recommend this series!
B008602KQI|5.0|Exactly what I wanted and delivered right on time. Had heard so much about the movie but wasn't familiar with it prior to ordering. Movie was absolutely worth seeing and a much needed bit of entertainment to take one's mind off of the stresses here in Afghanistan! Well worth the price!
B008K9UZY4|5.0|My daughter lovet it easy to manuver in her kindle. very similar to the actual video games plays the game for quite a while
B007JMW46U|5.0|I've read other versions but this is the 'cleanest' eBook version I've seen.  Well formatted and easy to read and the illustrations are clear on a Kindle Touch.
B007SGM084|3.0|Really the book was only okay to me.<br />The story was a little lame, the sex and conversation between the two main characters was just repetition, repetition.<br />Even the same adjetives are used over and over. The story could have and should have been one book.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Thought the book was way overrated, could've all been written in ONE book, ended up skipping a number of sections after a while...just not a story line that fits my interests.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Recently read this book and was about to give up on it when about 35% of the way through, but then a twist...and another twist... and subplots. It turned out to be a rather gripping and fairly well written book in the end. I honestly had a hard time putting it down to go to work. I recommend you give it a try.
B008602KQI|5.0|The acting is superb, the way the Capitol is depicted is spot-on, and the chemistry is wonderful amongst the characters.  We watched this movie for a third time when we got our DVD, and we immediately wanted to watch it again the next night.  Now we have to twiddle our thumbs till the next movie comes out!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I'm enjoying the trilogy ...mostly. The so called hot steamy scenes make think of a woman that has walked into an adult store for the first time in her life and her imagination began to wander.  The story is good but the sex scenes get a little redundant in their lack of creativity.  I couldn't help but chuckle at many of them bc they are the norm for me but the out of the ordinary for Anna. Cheers
B006LSZECO|3.0|As a fellow author I know how much work the author put into this book. Amy is one devious, manipulave, vengful women. I really felt sorry for Nick.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0066PQSJA Writer Interruptus and Other Stories]]
0893860220|5.0|Without doubt this is an exceptional book.<br />It contains 101 dialogues (recorded on tape in the early '70's) between Nisargadatta and his visitors.<br />Nisargadatta teaches in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta, like Ramana Maharishi.<br />I believe this is not a book for beginners; it will not appeal in that case.<br />There is not much to derive from this book for the ego/personality/individual; the message or wisdom at the heart of the book does not serve the personality/individual - 'it is what it is', plain, universal, impartial.<br />But the words of Nisargadatta do offer the reader insight and motivation to unmask and dissolve wrong understanding in general and wrong self-understanding in specific.<br />In fact it is good news: 'whoever wants to be naked-real, will have to undress'.<br />I conclude with a quote:<br />\\"Truth is loving and lovable. It includes all, accepts all, purifies all.<br />It is untruth that is difficult and a source of trouble.\\"
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|I know that it is difficult to make a movie of a book and please all the fans of the book. In the case of John Carter it appears that the movie was never introduced to the book! The film took what was one of my childhood favorites and made it into something I was sorry to have wasted money on. The only things that remained true to the books were some of the names. The entire paradigm for the movie changed, In the book the residents of Mars had faced the danger of extinction and had come forth victoriously into a state of victory in an advanced civilization. In the movie the residents were hanging on, barely!<br /><br />The movie did not do justice to the books or the characters in the books. Even if I would have never read any of the Edgar Rice Burroughs books, this attempt would have failed to entertain me. To me, that entertainment  is the mark of a good film. John Carter missed the mark.
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and couldn't wait to start the 2nd book. It is a true romance. Yes there is mild sex scenes parts but if you are offended don't read it.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This Kindle Fire was a gift. I had been talking about getting something smaller to carry with me during our travels. I love to read, keep up with email, and teach (I teach online insurance classes) and while a laptop is convenient and good, there are times when something smaller is needed. The Kindle Fire met my expectations. But then I wanted to protect it so that I wouldn't accidentally damage it. Being cost conscious, I looked for something inexpensive. This cover is lightweight and as such does not add much, if any, weight to the Kindle and is very durable. I love that I can open it up and use it as a stand (works well when I am checking my classes). Overall, I am very pleased with the case. It has met all my expectations.

B0075PYG1M|5.0|As a music lover, I've grown to be open to listening to a variety of musical genres over the years. With jazz being one of my favorite selections, I can appreciate how a musician playing his melody evokes just as much as emotion as vocalist singing their lyrics. My initial draw to the cd was one of my favorite artist, Lalah Hathaway. Her rendition of \\"Cherish the Day\\" was a smooth and velvety sound to my ears. At this point, of course I had to listen to the rest of the cd.  I'm so glad I did.  It was a perfect blend of artist with songs tailored to fit the styles that they're particularly known for. One pleasant surprise was the collaboration between Lupe Fiasco (who in my mind is more than just a rapper, he's a hip hop renaissance poet)and Bilal, \\"Always Shine\\".  \\"Black Radio\\" wasn't a song I intially liked, but the more I listened to Yasiin Bey, aka \\"Mos Def\\", it really grew on me. I don't think there's a bad song on this cd. I would recommend this cd for any newbie who is transitioning from R&B to Contemporary Jazz.
B008602KQI|4.0|From all the hype, it was not what I expected, but I did enjoy it! I watched it twice and would watch it again, which is not something I would normally do!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Very well crafted, the author has given life to the characters, the story is so riveting I have trouble putting it down.  The only downside is that I've worked my way near the end and fear I now have an addiction that I will no longer be able to feed.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br />The book is reasonably well written, but the story is about the sexual \\"education\\" of a young virgin and the \\"shady\\" life of a deviant sex predator. Not very interesting. For those who like that sort of thing, it is a good book, but I did not enjoy it - deleted it about halfway through.

030758836X|2.0|Nick, small-town boy from Missouri, moved to New York to become a journalist, and he was doing reasonably well working for a magazine when he met Amy, the daughter of two psychologists who were also children's book authors. They fell hard for each other and were married, and everything was great, more or less. Then the economy tanked and print journalism was spiraling downward anyway, and Nick was laid off. And then Amy was laid off, though she hadn't really had much of a \\"serious\\" job anyway. Then news comes that Nick's mother has terminal cancer and that makes up his mind for him; they're moving back to Missouri. And while it's a somewhat depressing homecoming for him, it's a trek into the wilds of the hinterland for native-New Yorker Amy. Nick and his twin sister, Margo, buy a bar (with the last of Amy's trust fund) and they try to scrape by.<br /><br />Then, one day, Nick comes home to find the front door standing open, the house partly in a mess (and partly, strangely, untouched), and Amy is gone. Was she kidnapped? Fled? Nick has various personal issues and he's not entirely straight with the police, which doesn't help. And we begin reading installments of Amy's diary over the past five years of their marriage, and it tells a very different story of their relationship from what we've been hearing from Nick.<br /><br />All well and good, right? But there are major problems lurking ahead with this book. As the first half of the story progresses, you begin gradually to wonder who's telling the truth. Is Amy simply wearing blinders? Is Nick going to turn out to be a very unreliable narrator? Is someone -- or everyone -- being set up? And then you come to almost exactly the halfway point, . . . and in less than a page the entire story has been turned on its head. Nobody is who you thought they were. The sudden new course the plot steers is Hitchcockian in its ability to knock you completely off balance. And, to be honest, I sat there for a moment trying to decide whether I wanted to finish the book or just chuck it across the room (metaphorically, anyway since I was reading it on my Kindle).<br /><br />Finally, I figured, well, there's a whole half a book left, who knows what new turn the story will take? And Flynn's first two novels were absolutely first-rate. And I could think of several possible justice-filled endings that might satisfy me, knowing what I now knew, so I took a deep breath and kept on going. I got maybe another hundred pages into it -- and I can't reveal what happens without ruining the book for you. But I found myself putting the book aside for a day, or two, or three, and reading something else. I wondered if finishing it was worth the time. I have a feeling a really bizarre ending to the whole story is looming, and you know what? I don't care. There's not a single character in this book -- not Nick, not Amy, not his father, not either of her parents, not the idiot Missouri cops, not Amy's redneck acquaintances at the cabin, not the various stalkers (or whatever) -- for whom I can feel the least bit sympathetic. Maybe Margo, a little. And maybe their cancer-ridden mother. But none of the others. They're not even interesting villains. And if you can't find a character in the book who's worth reading about, why the hell bother?<br /><br />Flynn is a first-rate craftsman when it comes to putting the words together, and I will wait patiently for her next book and I will give it a try.

B0083EY9EI|5.0|Emeli Sande is an incredibly talented artist.  Her vocal style is mostly R&B and very mainstream.  I have heard her compared to Alicia Keys and Adele (and fun fact, her first name is actually Adele).  Most of the songs on this album are ballads but they are still upbeat.  I would highly, highly recommend her music.  She is definitely an up n' coming artist worth checking out, and she was featured in the Closing Ceremonies of the 2012 London Olympics.

B00122N0MU|5.0|As a 50-something, I enjoyed Dire Straits hits for years without even recognizing who the band was, or the amazing talents of Mark Knopfler on the guitar.  Their music has always had a unique quality, and is right there with the best of classic rock & roll.......This \\"Best of\\" compilation of their music is great, and includes all of their big radio hits from the past, including Sultans of Swing, Money for Nothing, and many others.  I highly recommend this compilation for all classic rock fans !!!!
B007XNTDPA|4.0|I enjoy reading of Theodore Boone as he is a \\"real\\" charachter.  In this case it is very late in the book before you can guess as to what will happen so you are kept interested the whole way.
B008458O3S|5.0|I had my doubts when I tried the free version, but I ended up buying this version almost immediately. The puzzles are easy at first and then ramp up in difficulty. Very fun game!
B008YYCUES|5.0|Suits is one of the best programs on TV - the quick pace, smart dialogue, interesting characters formulate one of the best series dramas in a decade!<br />The entire cast is outstanding- the Emmys missed the mark when it overlooked this series for recognition.<br />Hopefully the Golden Globe Foreign Press will reward this exceptional program!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|My son told me about these books. I could not put them down. I am on book three and I continue to be intrigued by the characters. The author has a wonderful way of telling a story so you feel you are a part of it. I would recommend these books to those who enjoyed reading the Harry Potter series and the Eragon series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable.  Characters are very interesting.  Cannot wait for New season to arrive.  Mrs Patmore is a very special character.  Mr Carson as the butler really gives an air to the role in the household.
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|Very nice sci-fi novel. Alsor very interesting to read what Philip K Dick thought 1992 would be like: everything needs to be payed; videophones are everywhere...
B008602KQI|4.0|While ostensibly a story written for teens (and, perhaps a few advanced pre-teens),<br />the story line should (could) appeal to almost any age range.  The plot line, briefly, deals with a distopian future in which children (I believe anyone under the age of sixteen may be considered a child) are compelled to fight to the death, but for what?  The story indicates that it is for a kind of personal glory (not to mention a lot of money), but make clear why anyone would put themselves in such a position.  The film setting is beautiful.  It reminded me of some of the scenery in the Southern Appelacian Mountain area of the U.S.  The opening scene, at the very beginning of the \\"contest,\\" reminded me of the beginning if the Japanese Ninja film \\"Shin no Obi.\\" In which the young students, who have just been given their swords are told to kill the person standing next to them. As might be imagined, chaos and confusion reign until someone actually follows the directive.  The futuristic aspects of the film are well done and, I believe, are intended to show the increasing gap, in this country, between those who have much and those who have little.  I believe this movie is worth seeing and I'm curious about what will be made of the sequel.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Keeps you reading, can't put down.  If you watch the TV show it really helps to know the all the names and places.  Love this series.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn was a great find....... Read Girl Gone...and was hook and Dark Places<br />is just a very good read.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very good book. I had a hard time putting it down and thought the way the story unfolded was very well written and kept you interested.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is the first Hugh Howey book I have read, but I don't believe it will be my last.  Similar to Steven King's \\"The Stand\\", this work offered a chilling view of a post-apocalyptic world that was gritty yet perhaps accurately forecast. While the imagery was often dark, the descriptions were so vivid that you could picture life in the silo as something palpable and real.  All in all, a good read.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|So my grandkids (ages from 2.5 to 10.5 yrs) enjoyed this, & are happy to watch it repeatedly.  I'm happy to see it over & over again too as they watch.<br />A clever & real plot, the evil-doer(s) aren't scary but they are appropriately sinister.  There's a bit of fear, then some heroism, then some redemption.<br />Very well done & highly recommended.  First time viewing by kids less than 5 shld prob be w/an adult to keep perspective (it's a screen, this is a cartoon/movie) if needed.  (Unlikely tho)
B004G606K8|5.0|I love this book and the two that follow. It's a terrific story with varied characters that have depth with all of the imperfections that make them feel real. The pacing is excellent; it's fast in the areas it needs to be to keep you turning the pages, and slow in those areas that show the depth of feeling these characters have for each other. The descriptions allowed me to see the world the authors have created with vivid detail in my mind.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this title is that the formatting (on the ipad using the Kindle reader) was sometimes inadequate. There were areas that showed in italics that shouldn't be, and others that had a larger font size than they should (usually the first paragraph of a chapter).<br /><br />I highly recommend this title and the two that follow despite the formatting issues!
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent deal considering you can't just read one of the Fifty -- all three are easily consumed within a week. Having the trilogy on the Kindle allows for more discreet consumption as innocent bystanders have no idea what you're indulging in at the coffee shop. Great buy, highly recommended!
B0086O4FLC|5.0|I love the energy in all the songs on the album. It flows great from the first to last track and the musicianship is outstanding. The mix/mastering is natural but crisp and well done too. Everything has good placement in the mix and feels right.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My kids and I love to watch this movie.  It is entertaining to the kids (mine are ages 11 & 8) and there is quite a bit of adult humor, that goes straight over their heads but makes me laugh out loud the whole time.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I am in 10th grade and although it's meant to be read when you're younger, I really enjoyed it.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  As a matter of fact, my friend recommended it to me and told me to read it.  I love how the characters feelings are portrayed and how I feel as if I could play the main character.  To me a book is never good unless you can put yourself in their shoes and see what they see.  I would also recommend Kristin Cashore's books: Fire, Graceling, and Bitterblue (If you liked this series) simply because of the Romance, Adventure, and the way things are described.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was griping and I enjoyed it, which is very important, but the writing is a bit simple for my taste and I wasn't surprised by anything until the very end. Still, it was pretty good, and I plan to read the rest of the series. I suggest if you're reading it for the first time, don't read it for the hype, like I did.
B0011E9LBI|4.0|I really enjoyed Men in Black the first time I saw it many years ago. We all walked around the office with our pens and sun glasses, threatening to zap various individuals. Recently, I was watching a feature on the Cartoon Network with the grand children that contained a Mr Black and Mr White. It brought back memories of the Men in Black movie.<br /><br />I had a VHS copy of the movie but decided to obtain a DVD since VHS players are going the way of the dinosaur. I watched the flick the day it arrived and can't wait to share it with the grand kids.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this movie!  I think they did a good job with the casting. It is not a perfect match to the book but it highlighted most of the key points.
B00008YZYM|5.0|This is a fantastic movie for adults and kids alike.  It is good clean fun.  I'd recommend it for about age 7 and up personally.  Just because I don't think kids younger than that would really get the story line.  Two thumbs up.
B0086700CM|5.0|Purchase this app for my 8 year old daughter's Kindle Fire.  She loves it.  She plays it all the time.
B008602KQI|5.0|For those that read the book the movie has to be better than for those that had not.  The transition from book to screen was done about as good as could be done.  I was disappointed with the omission of some things I thought important and the movie not doing as much back story as needed on some others.  It has to be remembered that an audience can only sit so long in a theater seat.<br /><br />I don't want to include spoilers so I will say that if you want to see this movie go; it is about as good as it could be in the time a movie would have to run; if you can, read the book first, if not read it after.  The book was a five star book; the movie left out some of the book but did follow it faithfully.  If you see the movie and want to know what you missed; you will have to sit down and read.<br /><br />When I first started reading as a child, I loved the Readers Digest abridged books; that is, until I read a mystery that I couldn't follow.  I then read some full versions of the titles I had read abridged and found the reading experience much better.  If you watch The Hunger Games, you are getting the abridged version; a very good story but not the full story.  I am looking forward to the second and third installments.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was sa fast paced very enjoyable read/ride. I kept exclaiming out loud at all of the video/game, movie amd book references that were integrated not just decorations in the book. Lively and cleverly done. I look forward to the next book by this new-founf author!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wanted to see what all the advertising hype is about this book. WOW! Very disappointed. At best, this could be rated Mommy Porn. There is no plot and the writing is elementary. I can handle a little X-rated writing but the entire book just went on and on about absolutely nothing except \\"Oh My!\\". Sadly, I kept reading hoping that some kind of story would develop but was very disappointed. This book is not worthy of Amazon's best seller list.
B007SGM084|2.0|I read a variety of books, and am generally easy to please...however, I thought these books were poorly written. Too repetative on many words and details, to the point of mild annoyance. If you take out the adult content, it reminded me of books that are written for a junior high audience. This had the potential to be a good book (the plot was promising!), but instead I was disappointed.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I'm more the superhero kind movie but I rent this for my family and I ended up getting in to the movie a lot.
B007MJT1K2|5.0|Had a lot of fun watching with my son.  Great adventure.  It entertained both of us.  Can't wait for the next one.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The Innocent is one odf Baldacci's better recent books.  Lots of excitement a good plot and some interesting characters.  Only thing missing is a little believeability.<br />The story gets a little out of hand with our hero becoming almost a super hero to beat the bad guys -good guys or is it the other way around?
B008FC4WA4|4.0|Nice story, really liked the \\"bastard\\" character, wish it was a long book to know more about him. Love all Nick Hornby's books! Waiting for the next one...
B0068LYEHA|5.0|This book reads like a comedy routine and if you don't find at least a handful of things that resonate with you and have you laughing out loud, you have some living to do!
B008MEM24S|4.0|In the end, this game is a lot like Where's My Water. It is enjoyable, and the new voice-overs add something to the game. The balloon bonus levels are interesting, but not as difficult as the \\"tilt\\" bonus levels in WMW. Just like WMW, I think this game can be played through a little too quickly, but it is cheap entertainment. It is also a game my 5 yr old enjoys without getting too frustrated.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not the best book I have read but it was interesting and different. I'm sure there will be a sequel so I can't wait to see what she does next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Captivating, exciting read.  I was immediately caught up in the story.  The characters were believable, and there are many emotions that are felt while reading this book.  I highly recommend this book.  I'm now into book three, and have a hard time putting it down.
034580404X|5.0|EXCELLENT!!! Very good reading, could NOT put it down. As soon as I finished 1 book I started the next.  Read all 3 books in week and a half.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it this game just wish I had enough time to keep up with it but a lot of fun
B0009RCPY8|5.0|This is a really good movie. Both of them are but the original is really good. One of the best scenes is when the cop or whoever he was open the trap.You should get this.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|Nice brief history of all aspects of the Korean War... valuable to understand the dynamics of this overlooked part of America's 20th Century history...
B007RTAR64|4.0|I wanted this as a collectible, to never take out of the box. The plastic on the side was bent inwards so the box itself was damaged. Her hair seemed to have been loose and all over the place.
B005AKFXZW|1.0|Too much description leaves nothing to the imagination. If I want to see a movie I'll go to the cinema. This is all about detailing scenes, and nothing about character developement or story. Tedious,boring and all in all a waste of time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book and an extremely fast read. It kept my interest throughout the story so much that I had to get the second book once this one finished.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good read!  Especially if you liked 50 Shades.  Had a really hard time of putting it down.  Can't wait for the second book.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|An excellent followup to \\"The Name of the Wind\\" that continues Kvothe's journey towards becoming his word's greatest hero. Easily as good as, if not better than the first book.
B008602KQI|5.0|Delivered promptly upon release of DVD - in perfect brand new condition.<br />Movie is appealing to most age groups, with the exception of under 1,2 as it is<br />quite violent in nature...subject matter is mature and somewhat disturbing,<br />overall, an excellent film.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|It's a simple concept, that grows more complicated as you progress.  It is a mind game, not a skill game.  Enjoy.
B008D47DXC|5.0|I loved the movie years ago.  It's still good.  I wanted to be able to watch it again whenever I wanted.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie is great story. The author of this really came up with a great fantasy. I hope his fantasy never becomes a reality!
B006LSZECO|3.0|this book was a fun read, a little predictable but i enjoyed it and wanted to keep turning the page. worth reading
030758836X|4.0|I agree with a previous reviewer. The book kept me wanting more but the author didn't know how to end the story...unless there will be a book where it left off.  But otherwise would recommend it!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I had just read the book and was surprised to see that it followed the book very very very well.
B005EPFA8I|5.0|This is a movie that you will enjoy, especially if you're into pre-history and early human development.  You will loose none of its impact by watching it in 2d!
B008602KQI|5.0|I love the Hunger Games - I am a big fan of movies, so I watched the movie and then read the book and I couldn't be more excited about the tale of Katniss and her world. This was one of the first things I ever pre-ordered and I love Amazon's price guarantee - and 19.99 is NOT bad for a brand new DVD - plus I got a digital copy in my library on here ;o}
B002BI6SMI|5.0|me and my fiance were trying to figure out what movies to watch. we decided to watch taken and it was the best decision we made we both actually loved it. she went to work the next day I went to school the next day and we talked about it to our friends and told them that it was a must see. watch this movie you will not regret it.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The app would be much better if there was a way to shut it down.  It's always running so your battery drains more quickly.  Otherwise I really liked the app.
B008602KQI|5.0|I am sure many will say \\"it's not as good as the book\\" which is true but the movie is still very well done. The cast is excellent and the major points of the book are all captured in this film. For those that haven't read the book, I think you will enjoy this movie as well.
B008602KQI|5.0|Saw the movie in the theater and decided I wanted to own it. Can't wait for the rest of the movies to be released as well.[[ASIN:B0084IG8TM The Hunger Games [2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
B007SSEBCU|1.0|Streep gives her usual fine performance, although she sounds a bit like her rendition of Julia Childs.  The real problem with this film is that it makes no attempt to teach us anything about Margaret Thatcher and how and why she came to be what she is.  Instead the script dwells on ghosts, delusions, declining health, and what we are supposed to believe was an unreasonable, domineering drive.  Unfortunately the film can be used to illustrate what we mean by a \\"Hollywood\\" version of a famous and influential person's life.  Perhaps someday there will be an attempt to probe Mrs. Thatcher's life and the influences that made her who she became in a serious way, but this is not it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book one was so addictive that i finished it in 3 days! I couldn't wait to start the next book. I find myself reading late into the night and half to make myself put it down. It was definitely worth the money!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I havent read the books but I will after seeing this movie. Both my grown daughters read the books and loved the  movie.  My 12 yr old grandson read the books and loved the movie also.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No, I'm not calling author Mark Owen a liar or a leaker: but this book became necessary because White House & other administration individuals both lied about this mission & mixed their lies into leaks that endangered occupational security for this & future special forces missions, endangered SF operatives, decimated human intelligence recruitment by exposing them to arrest & imprisonment (if not death), & discouraged the morale of not just SF teams but other troops who need to have absolute confidence that the command structure \\"back home\\" is fully behind them.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon's speedy delivery of the Kindle e-version, I was able to start this book shortly after 9 PM PDT on release day & finish it in the early hours of morning. I've read LOTS of SF books, fiction & non-fiction, & I'd rank this in the top 10%. Not the best, but very satisfying; & among the very top for (1) its unique insight into one of the most important SF ops conducted in the war on terror; & (2) its challenge to the \\"higher ups\\" to shape up: don't leak secrets; don't tell lies; don't allow among yourselves what you refuse for the men & women who actually risk their lives for your operations.<br /><br />The author has pledged that he did not break security for this mission or missions in general. He has pledged to give a bulk of the his profits to veterans' charities. He likely could not have set the record straight had he submitted the manuscript pre-publication, &, IMHO, that is one of his top priorities: he wants us, ordinary citizens, to know that we can't always trust our government & its politicians, but we can trust our troops.<br /><br />Thank you, every service man or woman who has risked (& many given) your lives to protect this country. Thank you Mark Owen & the rest of the team that got Bin Laden for your service. I'm proud to buy this book to honor Mark Owens & the other team members. I'm proud to buy this book to tell the government & political people responsible for theleaks & double standards that American citizens will support our troops even against our elected & appointed leaders who have self-interest rather than patriotism as their motivators. I'm proud to buy this book to increase donations to veterans' support services. In fact, I think I'll buy a few copies (1) to support Owens more; (2) to give to others who will enjoy & learn from reading this amazing story, & (3) to demonstrate to the powers that be how hard it is to put the cat back in the bag once it's let out.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Great tidbits on the mindset of a successful entrepreneur. Cuban provides insight and advice for those who want to start a business and for those who already have. Short book, easy read. Well worth the price.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|the book is ok - not high on the reading list. I would not recommend the book to others unless they have nothing else to read
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I regret investing the money and time in this series. I started by wanting to see what all the fuss was about, and kept going because I kept thinking it would get better and I'd already paid for it. It's a rip-off combination of Twilight and Pretty Woman, and not as well done as either of them. There is no basis for why these characters come together, back story is provided only when it's required by a new absurd event, plotting is thin and unrealistically paced, and threads and characters are left dangling. Anastasia is bland and two-dimensional. The shame is that it really had the potential to be fantastic. The real ending is boring and unsatisfying, and the add-on ending proves that the author and editor know they screwed this up. They should have started over with Christian as the main character and told it through his eyes. As they handled it, they were a day late and a dollar short.
B008476HBM|5.0|I did read this book in school (many years ago) and had forgotten much about the book.  How important family is and what we in today's world take for granted, love and family.
0718157834|5.0|This book is juat amazing! I absolutely laughed out loud and then before i knew it i was wiping tears from my eyes.  I had read a few reviews and wanted to wait until i was alone to read the ending.  Amazing boook, thoroughly recommended and well done jojo - you have tackled a very difficult subject that most dont want to discuss let alone read in their own time.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|this book was a little hard to understand at first, but it was a great book. very sad at times
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The first chapter had the reader intrigued...very thought out and the plot was very intense and kept you wanting more....had a hard time putting it down.  Highly recommend this book....enjoy!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The fact that I'm still thinking about this book shows how disturbing it is. To say why gives away too many details. Read it, think about it, talk about it. Character driven, none admirable in their own sick way. Even makes my state (MO) look awful, not totally inaccurately.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was fast-paced, well-written, unpredictable, surprising, and kept me on the edge of my seat. It was also pretty instructive historically about a period of U.S. history! Highly recommend.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I recently fell in love with Downton Abbey! I'm so glad I was able to get the second season on DVD quickly through Amazon!
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the book and loved the movie.  Will definitely purchase all the sequels and have read all the books.  Purchased<br />both books and movies from Amazon!  Great...totally recommend it!
B008BIN9EW|1.0|This game was a great game when I was able to play it on my S2, I had to reset my phone to factory default and after that, it was no longer compatible with my devise wtf!
B0001ARCFA|2.0|I've only owned 3 headphones - AKG K271, these, and The Audio Tecnica M50s.  The M50s blow both out of the water.  I was so underwhelmed when I first wore these it was shocking.  I tried to return them a few weeks ago but it was passed the deadline to return products.  These headphones lack clarity, they have no bass, and are extremely overpriced.  For an extra $50, you can have an outstanding pair of headphones instead of these.  Especially if you listen to music heavy in bass, you do *NOT* want these headphones.  Some AKGs have some bass, but these have very little.  They are just uninspiring, and it really degrades the music listening experience.  Get the M50s, you will thank me later.<br /><br />edit: I want to make it very clear that the lack of bass is not my only reason for disliking these headphones.  I found the mediums and highs to be very washed out and unclear.  Additionally, these headphones will not get loud at all.  With my system's volume at 100% AND with a sound boost, at the highest volume setting they were still not very loud.  What I am saying is that with an extra $50 you can buy a much better set of headphones, whether they be M50s or not.  These are just a very poor set of headphones for the money, and I would advise staying away from this model.  AKG as a brand is good, and I liked my K271's (though I prefer my M50s), but these headphones are rubbish.
B003GK21OE|3.0|I have always enjoyed reading David Baldacci novels. I found this one predictable and a bit labored in patches. Still a good read though.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|So often in a series, the author gets lazy and the plot line becomes predictable.  This is not the case in MOCKINGJAY by Suzanne Collins.  The discovery that there really is a District 13 is only the start of a narrative arc that begins a revolution that never reassures the reader of its' outcome.  The ending surprised me, probably because I was expecting a different outcome.  But I think that readers who enjoyed  'The Hunger Games'  will find 'The Mockingjay'  equally satisfying.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|Very inciteful.  Changed my belief about roswell. True believer now about our country's cover-up of the Roswell crash. Loved the book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Also read [[ASIN:B0093TFLYY Taster's Choice (If you like 50 Shades Of Grey)]] <-- Both of these are great books. I loved the trilogy by EL James, and followed right behind it and read the Taster's Choice book by Jamie Fawkes. Hot combination!!!
B000W1PXTU|4.0|When I was a kid in the seventies, I would put in an 8-track of this before I went to sleep at night. In the morning, I'd do a little acting exercise where I'd try to embody the mood of the first song I heard when I woke up.
145162445X|5.0|An excellent and  challanging examination of the ways in which moderen physics informs our  contemporay cultural view of the universes' origin. No math or sophisticated physics is needed to understand the information presented.  The reader is advised to pay close attenion to the exposition and follow the chain of reasoning closely.<br /><br />The physical facts are presented in this book in  clear, precise, and non-technical prose. However, the reader must make the connection to the analytical consequences of the physics.  Dr. Krauss has presented a excellent description of the philosphical implications. He makes clear distinctions between acknowledged measurable and predictable material fact and speculation. He makes clear his own bias from the beginings while leaving readers free too weigh the imformation for themselves.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|It was a pretty good movie. Lots of action. Sometimes it was a little unbelivable. I did not like the ending. But overall a good action movie. Laim Neeson was good as usual. The wolves were pretty nasty!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After the first two suspenseful books, I was a bit disappointed with the plot of the last. I understand the fantasy of changing a hardened man, but it just didn't keep the same suspenseful thrill as the other two books.
B000SEGEKI|4.0|Interesting approach. Easy to read. I recommend strongly. There are very tips during the whole text. It's good for beginners and experts professional.
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|I went into thus read skeptical after a friend ranted and raved over it all night at a party. He's got questionable taste.<br /><br />He at last got his hooks in when he emphasized how truly the book fit in the noir category as easily as it did sci-fi.<br /><br />Takes some time to get the slang down since it's presented immediately and without context in many cases. But that just builds the atmosphere after one figures it out.<br /><br />Excellent read. I'll be getting the others in this series as well.
B005Q6GIY0|5.0|Awwww, it's refreshing to see real acting - not a reality show drama.  SOA does a great job of keeping their audience on their toes.  As much as we want the club to do right, it just wouldn't be as much fun to watch.  Great job writers.
B0036SXQEA|5.0|A re-cap for me. But the HD quality was very good. The movie is a great story that reminds watchers where and why love exists in all our lives.
B002MGIIZE|5.0|i guess either u love it or hate it. w/o giving the details away, it's very bizarre & \\"out-of-the-box.\\" i loved it. not \\"horror\\" as i'm used 2 but thought-provoking & a psychological thriller that opens your mind to other-worldly thinking. will watch over & over again!
0345803485|5.0|Enjoyed all 3 books. The first 2 were a little better than the third one, however, still enjoyed it very much.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Very good workout.  I have been using the DVD for 30 days and have seen results and still can't move pass level 1.  I plan on using this for years to come.  Love it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We (my wife and I) have thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. The show is excellent - family friendly, a bit of a history lesson and interesting plots and characters.  Highly, highly recommended.
B0084RSYEK|4.0|I love Eddie Murphy, I made a point to catch this movie at the theater but it was gone too soon. Seen it again listed on Direct tv, missed it again. Found it on Amazon, my favorite movie source, watched it , enjoyed it.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|Very entertaining... we had company over to the house and surprisingly no one had seen the movie. We all enjoyed it!
B007B5EDEG|4.0|I wanted to buy the books having watched the TV series and the books have not disappointed.  It is a great read in the ever convenient ePub format.<br /><br />However, the publisher needs to re-evaluate their pricing structure for digital content.  You can buy the 5 paperback books for less then the digital version.  Where is the logic in that?<br /><br />So I have given it 4 stars, with 1 star taken off for its pricing compared with the paperback.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I read this book in record time - couldn't put it down. Hard to describe - so many lifetimes, so many plot lines, but characters you'll love.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love the move...and read a couple...can't wait for the other movies to come...Never thought I get such good service ...but it came quickly and it was so easy to order...this won't be my last time either.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|I was a teenager in the 80s and like many kids of that era LOVED THIS MOVIE! It most definitely is a classic 80s movie! In any case I let my own kids watch it and they thought both the hair and clothes styles were old and funky, does that make ME Old and funky I sure hope not because those were some of the best years of my life! And that 80smusic, that was when music was music and not noise like it is today! In any case I LOVED THIS MOVIE but you'd really have to be from that 80sera to appreciate it!
B006RUJST6|2.0|First off I will admit, i didn't finish reading the book as i lost interest 63% in, according to Kindle, so feel free to take this review with a grain of salt.<br /><br />In any case, i just simply didn't relate with any of the characters and was not drawn into the storyline so when it got too much i put it down and moved onto something else.
B002RB7VMA|5.0|I've listened to a couple of his albums and Crazy Love is his best.  \\"Haven't Meet You Yet\\" is one of his original songs and my favorite.  I also have it as a CD.
B004IK9CTS|4.0|about an old classic like Dorian Gray?  Still entertaining after all these years.  A bit wordy for the new crowd,  but the lesson of the story is infinite.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I quite literally did not put the \\"Hunger Games\\" down until I finished the last page!<br /><br />While these books may be aimed at youth, this great-grandfather enjoyed them immensely; engaging and fast paced; for a time, I existed in Panem, worked in the mines, fought to feed a family, and suffered along with the books main characters from the overwhelming power and extremes of a government gone mad.<br /><br />I found them very well written, better I might say than Collins previous work, and thorough: nothing was left out, and there was nothing unnecessary added.<br /><br />I have not seen the motion picture; for fear that it will dilute the story, as all book-to-movie processes do. For me, the books are well worth the money, and a great read!
B007JMW46U|5.0|This is a great Kindle book for free. It includes very nice illustrations from original books and also presents clear text for reading.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Definitely a must see movie lots of action, gets the blood pumping. very realistic. it kind of shows you what those soldiers go through
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|I read these books just before the movie came out.  I missed it in the theaters but heard great things about the movie.  Once I was able to rent I did.  I was a bit disappointed in the movie. I'm glad I read the books because otherwise I'm not sure the whole thing made a lot of sense.  They do follow the story plot but I feel they missed a lot.  MY husband got the benefit of me stopping the movie for back ground explanations.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the series. Well written and great plots. The ending was okay, a bit of a cliff from the previous chapter. I would definately recommend this book to others; adults and teens alike.
B0014EU5XI|4.0|I really like the timespan coverage of the music. It highlights how the changed over the years. I'm a fan of what most people consider \\"both\\" eras (the country/blues and synth rock). My only real issue (aside from a couple of songs I would have liked to see, ie: TV Dinner) was some of the transitions from song to song could have been better from a fidelity standpoint. You'll have a song with a lower average loudness level and weak bass and it goes into one way louder with heavy bass, making you scramble for the volume or bass control knob. I've seen this on other compilations too and I don't understand why the studio can't do some basic volume leveling.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|A well written script, awell shot movie with some breath-taking action shots and scenery as well make this a very worthwhile investment in time and money. it's a great way to spend both.
B006GLNTSM|5.0|Love this show!! Had to purchase 3 episodes not shown on HBO to go.  Same for a for the others.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game! It starts out very easy, but gets harder as you move up the different levels. I highly recommend it.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Better than I thought it would be.  I liked it alot.  Good twisted love story about two college students with troubled past falling in love. Abby is running from her past and Travis is a bad boy she is attracted to. Does he bring her back to her past or does she move forward from it?  Read it and see!
B000Q79HS8|4.0|This may be the 3rd. installation but it isn't the weakest. Strong script, plenty of action and room for continuing the series without any problems.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|A lot of people I know didn't like this book, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it was better than Catching Fire.
B008602KQI|4.0|I love the story.  Read all three books and just had to see the movie.  I think they did a pretty good job.  Unfortunately, there are always small details that get left out when going from a book to a movie.  Sometimes this makes it hard to understand the significance of what is going on.  My husband had not read the book but still enjoyed the movie (with a few explanatory comments from me).  My son loves the extras with the DVD.  I would recommend purchasing both the books and the movie.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I ordered this product to move my old slides that go back 50 years to when my kids were little to my computer. Having someone else do them would cost a fortune and this is a really great price for a product that does a wonderful job. I was a little confused by the small manual that came with the machine. But, their email is on the manual and I emailed them and what service!!! I got a CALL, can you believe that and a return email along with a new manual they have out. Their support is great. I have come to the conclusion that the only companies that I want to do business with are ones that have good support. Sam is their support person and so nice. He told me to call him anytime for help. That's hard to find these days. What a breath of fresh air. I have now done about 60 of the hundreds of slides I have and am very pleased with this product and what fun I am having seeing these old pictures and reliving them again. Thanks DB Tech for the Memories.
B00130UFY2|4.0|Action, Action, Love and loss, more action, aliberal dose of suspense and more action. Boredom, not going to find it here. A great follow-up to the original.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The trilogy is amazing and my friends and I all traded our books around. It's worth the read to finish the trilogy!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|If you're a fan of the original Quell, you'll love Quell Reflect.  Loads of levels.  Puzzles are fun, but not to tricky.  If you get stuck there's a handy hint button.  Beautiful on my Fire.  I would recommend Quell for any avid puzzler.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|we missed this when it was released years ago<br />we were wonderfully suprised  it was a great story and a beautiful film<br />we will be watching it again next week
B007IJDXFK|5.0|I've only been a fan of Anathema a couple of years now. I'm certain this is my favorite release of theirs. I'll be enjoying Weather Systems for many years to come.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a definitely amazing book! It took me 4 day to read the entire trilogy. I just could not put it down. Of course, if you aren't into love, action, romance (extremely dirty), and family, then maybe this book isn't for you. But this is a book where you can completely connect with the protagonist and even wish you were her.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I keep reading all the episodes over and over.  They are so good.  I can't wait for Season 3 in January
B00164GDA0|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. It brought back many memories of my youth. Pez candy. You flinched, so you get punched in the arm twice,and many more things of that era when I was a youth. If you lived in the  50's and injoyed that time,this is a MUST SEE movie for you. ENJOY.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book took a few pages to get me hooked - but once I was hooked... I was hooked. I was told there was a twist to the story before I read it... but I figured out what the twist was as I read further into the book and I saw it coming. I think I would have figured that out even if no one told me there was a twist. So - it was disappointing to see that coming so easily.  And I really didn't like the ending at all. It was very flat and didn't have the same quality as the rest of the book. But overall, I can't complain... it was well written, gripping, easy to follow, and hard to put down.  It is very uncommon to have a story be so good and so interesting when the main characters are so unlikeable. (The musical \\"Chicago\\" comes to mind as another example of unlikeable characters, yet a good story line).  And a book with those qualities is worth five stars to me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you finished the first book, then I'm sure it would be easy to pick up the second. Loved the entire trilogy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book and it did take me about halfway through it to really start enjoying it, but the more I read the more I got hooked! I highly recommend this book to everyone, if you like a good love story you will love this book!
B008LY5VHE|4.0|The story plot is simple. See Shark, See Shark terrorize a small coastal town, see people die, see people kill shark!  There you have the entire story in four declarative statements.  Although I am one of the ones that was inspired to go to college and get a biology degree because of the salty shark researcher in the movie, I cannot get passed the cheesy mechanics of \\"Bruce\\" the shark Still the director did a supurb job at making us \\"WAIT FOR IT\\" type scenes that still excites us today.  Although I have become accustomed to 21st century techniques in Hollywood, this story will be forever a classic. (But if truth be known, I  liked the book better~)
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I really like R. Downey Jr and the<br />special effects were interesting. Hope they make another Sherlock<br />Holmes movie.
B00553U3HM|3.0|I have only recently started reading Ken Follett and all the books so far have been fascinating with the amount of historical detail and research.  The Man from St Petersburg was readable but didnt catch my interest as much as his other novels.  Worth a read in any case.<br /><br />Fortunately there are lots of other Ken Folletts to read.  I have recommended his books to friends who have also become fans.
B00846REIS|1.0|Maybe it was my fault assuming that because it was on the New York Times Bestseller list, it would be worth my time.  I finished the book because I paid for it and could not rationalize not giving it a chance to pick up, but it was seriously terrible.  First of all, it's almost a carbon copy of 50 Shades of Gray! The leading male role is essentially the same person.  He even suggests at one point in the book that he and the female lead have a dominate/submissive relationship.... I do not understand how both this book, and 50 Shades of Gray would be on the Bestseller list at the same time. Why are people essentially reading the same book twice?  Also, maybe I'm a prude, but the erotic scenes in this book were disgusting and unrealistic. The author takes away from the heat of the book by making her main characters have sex every other page; it makes you dread those moments rather than look forward to reading them...
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Best Linkin Park since Meteora!  They are back to just doing their type of music, not trying a certain style, just the Linkin Park way!
B004GFN11A|4.0|Very useful on my tablet. Prefered over brower usage. It has a lot of great tools to use when you don't want to sit in front of a laptop or desktop. Definitely recommended.
B000W1SSV0|5.0|This is a great \\"cool age\\" Jazz album.  You could sit, dim the lights, push yourself back in a recliner (with or without a martini) and just groove . . . .  Stan Getz is truly an icon of this style.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I preorder this show every season,one of the rare things I buy for myself. This year is unlike any other and that is because its amazing and always one step further than the year before. Amazon treated me right with this because the Dvd went on sale a day before I recieved mine and they still sent my refund of what i paid. Once again excellent serve and if I could give it 10 stars I would.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I must say I loved this book. It was written in a simple way but it was very engrossing.  Loved the characters and their love story.  A must read!
B008602KQI|4.0|It is an entertaining movie and follows the book closely.  If you loved the books you will like the movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|Enjoyable, easy and fast read.  E.L. Hunt appeals not only to what most women desire in a monogomous relationship, but also to what most men can aspire to become with that special someone.  My \\"goddess\\" is back!  Book 1, adventurous.  Book 2, spellbinding and unexpected.  Book 3, anticipating the next!
B008602KQI|5.0|Best action, suspense and great story line.  This movie keeps you on edge to see what will happen next.  Characters that you love and love to hate.  Recommend it highly.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is as fun as where's my water.I hope they keep updating.It requires logic and common sense.I am glad I found Perry
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|Melancholy and romantic, this movie is a classic worth seeing more than once.  Too bad online rentals are too expensive to do so.  Amazon should discount the subsequent showings after the first one, y'know?
B006LSZECO|3.0|a lttle confusing to read since the story jumps around.  Also, did not like the ending...after the whole story unfolds there is really no ending!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Awesome show just keeps getting better every season cant wait for season 5 so we can see what the gang gets into next and finally what jax  can do while he is in charge
B007MNV5WU|4.0|excellent game ,but some are very testing; still rate it very high.would like to be able to control the birds once fired into space.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book was recommended to me because it was said to be similar to \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" so I figured I'd give it a go.  Cheryl, the author, tells the story of her mother's death and how she basically ruined her marriage, dabbled in drug use and after going to REI for a shovel, she is intrigued by this book about Pacific Crest Trail.  Relatively unprepared, this novice hiker (saying if she can walk, she can hike) decides to hike the trail from the Mojave Desert to Oregon.  The journey itself is the real meat of the story with the interesting people she meets along the way, as well as the time she spends totally alone.  She successfully manages to weave the story of her physical journey with her mental journey and makes peace with many things that were in her pre-PCT life.
1858705770|5.0|Why o why does Amazon bundle up all the reviews on the various release formats of the new Skynyrd album.  There is the standard release, the deluxe version and for some of us, the Classic Rock Fanpack version featuring the new album, with some slightly different bonus tracks, a full color 132 page magazine about the new album, interviews with all members, and stories of the past, present, and future.  Plus there is a review of every Skynyrd album pre and post plane crash, as well as the best live and compliation offerings.  There is also an exclusive poster, pin and keychain.  The whole deal cost $20.00 through the UK magazine website, and it totally worth it for the TRUE Skynyrd fanatic!  The magazine alone is worth the price, and you get a better understanding of why the band continues to record and tour, and believe me, it's not just about the money.  The new album is pretty darn good.  Not comparable to the old stuff, but this is a different Skynyrd now, and with that in mind, their winning streak that started with Vicious Cycle continues with Last of a Dyin' Breed.  Really good rock n roll, something that the Stones or The Who making new albums in this day and age, would not be classics like their 70's stuff is, but good old rock and roll.  Definitely worth picking up if your a fan, and if you are slurge a bit and get either the deluxe version or the fan pack.
B003MXB4FC|4.0|A strange movie with an unreal feel, entertaining nevertheless.  Certainly a hit with the kids (8 and 14 years old).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is great I could not stop playing it. I even dreamed about playing it. and told my family about it
1451627297|3.0|After SK's accident I lost interest in his books. Following his accident, the new stuff just wasn't the same as his other books.  Then, this was book was recommended to me by fans of his older work so I gave it a go.<br /><br />Jake gets introduced into a doorway into 1958...and he loves it. The tastes, the smell and the simplicity of the past.  Then Al, who introduced him to it, presents an interesting argument:  What if you could change the past and make someone who suffered badly, live happily.  What follows is a beautiful description of the past, of that time and it is just gripping.<br /><br />I missed the multitude of complex characters from his past books but this was gripping.  I felt like I was there.  Easily the best SK book I've read in many, many, many years.<br /><br />***MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD, DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING*<br /><br />However, I found the ending a tad disappointing.  I liked the general idea, as opposed to a happy ending where he went back living happily ever after with Saide.  However, I didn't like that his choices lead to the earth destroying itself.  It could just have been that it turned the society into shit and that made him leave it alone.  To me that would have worked better than the whole world imploding on itself because too many new 'stings' had been created by all whose life was changed.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I thought season one was pretty good, but the second one kept me watching. So hangips on picture quality and there was no lag in the streaming times.
B002DS3982|5.0|I loved this movie i really felt for hurricane denzel did an awesome job portraying him i have had it a week and i watch it sometimes twice a day.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|It was an excellent movie that really makes you think. Happiness isn't always wrapped up in money & riches. This movie really makes you take a step back & realize that life is fragile & wealth can be found in many other places in our lives.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I often download books to my Kindle to read and decide whether or not to purchase the actual book, hard cover or paperback based on how good the book is.<br /><br />This entire series will be a definite must-purchase.<br /><br />The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was much more fast-paced than the previous two books in the series. Either that, or I was enjoying the books so much I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />It's just rather sad that Stieg Larsson passed away before any more could be written.
B008602KQI|5.0|A great trilogy once you get started you won't be able to stop. So much adventure and so many mishapes. You will truly enjoy all three books.
B002B8EUOG|5.0|From the beginning of this series - if you can get past all the SMOKING !!!!  you are hooked.  Every single episode of every season is absolutely addicting.  I cannot wait until Season 6 is here and hopefully (I heard) Season 7.  They want to take it all the way through the 60's  !!!  FANTASTIC SHOW - If you haven't watched it - START.<br />Thanks, Amazon !!!  By the way - NETFLIX did not have Season 5 and they won't have it for a year.....  I'm so thankful for Amazon !!
B005AKFXZW|4.0|Great book very interesting tales with lots of twists and turns not just on the trapeze. Love books like this that offer intrigue to reader and make me wonder if this is possible.
B007Q476KU|4.0|Nice story, just don't like that everyone in the movie has a British accent. Not all Europeans have a British accent when they speak in english. If you don't want to do subtitles, at least have the Germans speak english with a German accent and the Irish with an Irish brogue.
B00181MHQU|5.0|This movie is a classic! Fabulous dancing, great songs, wonderful acting.<br />The amazon viewing of West Side Story is clear and of good quality.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|My husband and I have watched every episode of Sons of Anarchy.  By far one of the best continuing drama's on TV.  We are looking forward to season 5 starting next week.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Ok, it took me forever to read this series.  I thought this was way below my intellectual capacities and certainly was not my preferred genre.  My girlfriend loaned it to me and kept asking if I add read it yet.  I felt trapt, so I finally settled in to get the deed done. Admittedly while reading it I hid the cover so no one would know what I was doing. So, here's my confession - I loved it!  E.L. James really has created characters that I found myself  really \\"pulling\\" for,  hoping they'll make it through!  The sex is steamy, and there sure is a lot of it - certain parts made me a little squeamish to be sure.  The idea that these characters, Ana and Christian, love each other so intensely is the theme that carries the entire series, without that emotional connection I could not have got through the books.  All that said,  the books are not literary jewels.  The story is set in Seattle/Portland and James tends to lapse into British colloquialisms quite often.  Since these characters are Americans and obiously set in an American environment, it just doesn't fit.  She tends to use the same desciptive phrases over and over,  and her writing made me wonder if there was an editor involved in this story at all.  Ana certainly doesn't do much to bolster the feminist movement either.  She is rather easily mollified by Christian's sexual prowess (over & over!).  So rather than go on and on about the faults of this book - I'd prefer to say if you're not looking for a classic read, and don't mind some detailed sex scenes, it's a pleasant diversion for an evening read! A guilty pleasure if you will!
B0012BX062|5.0|A double CD before his untimely passing with classic songs! I have had to purchase this soooo many times. But now I have it in mp3 format....it will be with me forever!
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This was a terrific movie.  Not a lot of cast that I knew, but they were really wonderful.  Filming was great and the area was beautiful.  Shipping was lightning FAST![[ASIN:B008F5YDRI Salmon Fishing in the Yemen]]
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Wasnt as good as the book but was worth buying and watching. Bought on Amazon through a Roku In HD
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was so looking forward to this book... I felt it was very boring at times.....LONG, drawn out periods.... Very disappointed.....
B000WYF2FW|5.0|I first heard this album when it came out.<br />Despite all the controversy about \\"MY SWEET LORD \\" sounding like \\"HE'S MY GUY\\" (which I'm sure was accidental,  this is a fine album from the \\"spiritual\\"<br />Beatle.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|Very disturbing book - especially being the mom of a teen.  Too much crazy, disfunction in one family!  Writing not near what Girl Gone is like either.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I am only about 10% into the book, but the author's writing style drew me in right away. I can relate to the content as well, so that helps.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Classic Baldacci.  This novel has twists and turns you don't see coming.  I'd like to see another novel with this \\"Hero\\" named John Puller.  When the next John Puller novel comes out, I will pre-order it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great follow up to the first book! Captivation, action filled and a love story for the romantics! Overall a wonderful trilogy!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Tube mate works great, has options to download video in multiple resolutions and formats. Can even download as MP3 which is great
B0018ARNME|5.0|This album has all the classic Neil Young tracks one could ever hope for \\"as of today\\". Even a non Neil Young fan (which I was a so-so) can appreciate his mastery and craft from this selection
B001N4Q4MA|5.0|It's my favorite move, even as a college student! I love how funny and lighthearted it is, plus the whole thing rhymes! What could be better??
B008XG1X18|5.0|Creative people unite! This is the best site to share what interests you. Great ideas, recipes and tons of inspiration.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|After reading the reviews for this movie , I had high expectations.<br />Unfortunately, the first part of the movie reminded me of watching the Wizard of OZ.<br />With all the crazy colored hairdo's, swirling beards and mustaches,and the most uncanny people.<br />And of course there was the character that played Dorothy, traveling through the woods,<br />being poisoned, then falling asleep on the ground.(wow...just like in OZ)<br />During the forest scenes,I was expecting the Wizard,<br />to come out from behind the curtain at any moment,and give Dorothy a bow.<br /><br />This may have been a good movie had they left out some of the corny resemblances to OZ.<br /><br />Not impressed.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this every night and love the rain noise. I easily fall asleep to these wonderful sounds. Very soothing and comforting
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Awesome Album. Lots of fun.Fun for me and my daughter.<br />Loves hearing the album while taking her to school.<br />So glad we picked it up.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Despite the size of this mighty tome, this book is addictively readable.  The writing is excellent as is the attention to detail.  The transition between books I and II is seamless. This sequel allows for additional character development which makes them more dynamic and compelling while the multiple story lines remain coherent.  I don't know how George R R Martin does it, but I'm glad he does.  A great read!
B003YNFYCO|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend who enjoys the Beatles early music and is very happy with this selection. And I think this cd finally sold him on putting away his broken cassettes - the sound is terrific.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|I do have a lot of bad habits and this was really an eye opener on fixing those. The experiments on mice were amazing! Just by reading 4 out of 9 chapters, I would still highly recommend you a buy!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I kind of like the book, but after reading no. 2 and 3 I started to skip pages because the story got very repetitive. How many 'beautiful husbands etc' and orgasms can one 'stomage'? There is some merit in the story as such. Some exitement and some drama. I would recommend it as light reading; don't take it seriously and enjoy reading while making a very long and very boring train/plane journey!
B008602KQI|5.0|I have watched it a million times! Literally . It is so Amazing and great. I can't wait for November 2013 for Catching Fire to come out.
B003QS9TKU|4.0|What a pleasant surprise. I downloaded this film that I had seen in my childhood for my 5 year old grandson before a 3 hour flight. It is not animated despite the cover. He loved it. I had to reming to laugh quietly, so as not to bother others. He said the war part was a little scary but afterwards he asked me about WW II. So there was even a mini history lesson op. See it !
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is super fun. Great game play. Great graphics. Great fun. Everyone in my family loves to play it. Young and old. Highly recommend!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE this game!  It is exactly the kind of puzzle I like to do.  I love that there are several packs that are available for free, so the play time is incredible.  The levels progress in intensity, and there have been times where I have been stuck for days on a certain level.  Sure you can find a route, but finding one that uses all available squares is much tougher.  I will be sad when I finish it!  Will have to find more games like this and the 3D cube game.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved all three books and enjoyed the Happy Ending on this one but I still was left feeling like it unfinished. I hope there are more books to come. It was something outside my comfort zone of reading but truly a nice escape and I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Maybe my least favorite of the Hunger Games series, but still a great read.  Suzanne Collins has a very vivid writing style and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I looked forward to bedtime to read about what experiences Katniss would go through.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I don't understand why these changes were made. All I want to do is find a copy of the remastered editions of the original trilogy, but they don't exist. WHY? Hayden Christianson was two when Return of the Jedi came out. Why is he in this?
B008UO7WB8|3.0|THe only reason that I continue to watch this show is because I purchased the season and I want my monies worth. The show is poorly written, unrealistic, ridiculous. Not worth your time unless you are a twelve year old girl, in which case the show content is not appropriate for that age group.
0823015017|4.0|I'm still working my way through this book.  It is not for the faint of heart!  By that I don't mean it's not a good book, it is but it goes into depths regarding color I never dreamed possible.  I sort of wanted a book that was full of \\"recipes\\" for mixing colors but I think this is much better.  After I have worked my way through this book,  I'm pretty sure I won't need a recipe book at all,  I will be able to write my own.<br />I have always felt held back by my color choices with polymer clay so this book is perfect for me.  Plus, there are plenty of inspirational pictures as well as some fun looking projects.<br />If you want a book that \\"teaches you to fish\\" rather than just giving you the fish,  this is the book for you.  I am fairly confident that this is going to be a well used reference book in my polymer clay library,  it is not a light read by any means.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abby is a must see.  Within the first episode you want to keep watching. The only warning I have is that you will be sad to know that the third season wont be out until March.  So go out and watch them all.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book series. The last book still had a lot of action and came to a good conclusion. It was surprising to see who Katniss actually ended up with. Overall great books and can't wait to see the other movies that come out. I definitely recommend this.
B000FCK42M|5.0|One of the best Don Winslow books that I have read. Captures your attention right off the bat and it is difficult to put down.  Great characters that are intertwined into a mesmerizing story line.
B005K17RU0|5.0|excellent.  I especially like the weather map that allows me to see weather patterns that are coming my way in the next day or so
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|How did I just now find out about this show. Each episode and each season just gets better and better.  Wait till you see the end of season 4!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Be patient with this book.  You think it is going to be a take off from media headlines, but it is not.  The author does an excellent job of weaving a tale that leaves you thinking.
B008M36EEI|4.0|This movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  I did not know what to expect with this movie, but the story line was good and the movie flowed easily, retaining my atten till the end
B000GOUMPI|5.0|Even though it deviates from the book, this a horror movie classic. I love watching it for all the architectural details and that moment when Jack is completely consumed by the Overlook.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This show has great acting, smart plots, lots of humor.  One of the best series I've ever seen.  Director does a great job of making you like and hate the main chracters at the same time.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Interesting concept.  Movie could've been a better production.  Definitely worth watching.  I had a feeling it was going to be a kids movie at the start (and since I hadn't read the book), however I was nicely surprised at the real violence and twists throughout.
B0086DBE62|3.0|This movie was with subtle comic moments. The satire was good too. But, I guess I expected more from Julia Roberts. Anyway, part of the fun was lost because I was cheap and didn't watch th e movie in HD.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Martin needs to review the rules applying to the intransitive verb To. be.  Also, he should learn when the use of the objective personal pronoun is inappropriate.. Teachers of English will find treasure trove of BAD examples to  illustrate these important rules.  One can accept these serrors in common speech but a writer should never do so except when a charracter intelligence is being demonstrated
B008EL4YX6|5.0|I love this game! If I would change anything it may be to add some hints when you get frustrated!
B007IQX1G4|1.0|If you'd like to be left with a sense of watching a slow train wreck, then check this film out.  Really bad ending.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this trilogy very fast, it was a very easy read. All the hype was right I thought these books were terrific. It's Pretty Women meets Twilight for adults with no supernatual things of course. It's a love story in the end with lots of kinky sex. Now realistically this story is far fetched but I think that was what the author was going for, a fairytale. There is lots of crazy sex which I enjoyed but some readers might not. Readers will wish and dream for their very own Mr. Grey. I have recommended these books to all my friends that have not read it already. Don't be ashamed to read this book in public girls, hold it up high and other women will probably comment on it. Now what am I going to read after these?
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Somewhat light but enjoyable movie. Good characters that you like, so you get involved in the story. I recommend it as entertaining.
1451627297|4.0|I had never read anything by Stephen King before - to be honest, I always thought he was too creepy/murder-y for my tastes. But my mom told me about this book and after a quick preview, I decided it was right up my alley. Revisionist historical fiction? Yes, please!<br /><br />The main character in 11/22/63 is Jake Epping, a teacher in present-day Maine. Through a friend, Jake learns of a time travel wormhole that always takes him back to the same day in September in 1958. Jake decides to go back in time to do two things:<br /><br />- Prevent a local man from murdering his wife and most of his children<br />- Prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating JFK (hence the 11/22/63 title)<br /><br />So Jake goes back in time and while he is waiting for both of these events to approach - there are five years between 1958 and 1963 after all - he begins to develop his own life. Sidenote: he didn't just kill Oswald right away because he was trying to get some better confirmation that Oswald actually did it (the book explains this a little better). Anyways, Jake takes a job, rents an apartment, continues to research/follow Oswald, and ends up falling in love with a woman named Sadie, all of which make his decision to change the past and then head back to the future more difficult to carry out. I was really surprised by the Sadie thread  - Jake's relationship with Sadie was a very sweet and poignant part of the story. I even cried a bit.<br /><br />Of course, as soon as Jake starts messing with events in the past, the future starts changing and that the past will do whatever it can to keep him from making changes, further complicating his decision to prevent the JFK assassination. He also learns that seemingly minor events in the past continue to repeat or harmonize as he moves forward in time.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this book. My only, very minor, complaint is that the timing and the pacing was a little odd. I know that's probably a strange comment about a time travel book, but King sped through some periods and dragged others out. This a book of a brick and most of it is good, but I think King could have sped up some parts a little bit. That said, it was worth the read and if I had more free time, I would have cranked through it even more quickly than I did.<br /><br />In a nutshell: 3.5 stars. I'm going to try to read some more Stephen King books.
B003B02O14|5.0|Grisham does not disappoint in this latest offering.  Book is full of suspense and twists and turns throughout.  The only disappointment....after a great buildup throughout the book, the conclusion of the story seems abrupt.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|This is a great book so far, love reading about James Fraser and looking to reading the section with his daughter.
B008602KQI|5.0|Daughter had her birthday party around this movie!<br />Loves it!<br />Read all the books!<br />Can't wait for the next sequel!
B00355L2TU|5.0|This exercise DVD is great. There are 3 levels.  I have done the level one workout about 10 times, last night I moved onto level 2 and it was a killer!  But i pushed thru and finished and feel great...Jilian really works out all of the different muscle groups.  I love it.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I strongly recommend this film. Great direction, great acting, and surprising character development. This isn't just action porn, there's an emotional response to everything that happens. Go watch.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great game for the family only bad thing is you can't get out of the game once you start. If there was a way to close out without shutting down I would rate it a 5 for sure.
B002DPRLJ8|5.0|Although some may call this movie dated and corny; nobody is murdered, drug use and gun violence are not glamorized, and the script was written by someone sufficiently intelligent to communicate without using vulgar language from the gutter.  Plus Doris Day and Rock Hudson were great in this film.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Once you get started with the series, it's hard to put down. Some of the intimate tales of this book seemed a little far fetched but the story line was enough to keep me interested. This is really a book of fantasy because I've never met or heard of anyone who has sex as much as this couple. Overall, it was a good book, just not very realistic.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I purchased the book because of all the Hype surrounding it. The writing skills were poor and there was absolutely no story line other than sex and more sex. This book is probably the most disappointing one I have purchased in a long time. If you like pornography which I dont then this book is for you. If you want a good read then dont bother with this one the author is not a good writer.
B008602KQI|5.0|A breath of fresh air!! Great movie, well done!! It's nice to see something in the movies that succeed other than vampires/werewolves
B00354Y9ZU|4.0|Seth Has a clear vision, an imaginative mind, and expresses his ideas beautifully.  The concept he explores of giving as a way to become indispensable is ancient, but exquisitely timely as we move from a spiritual to a secular age, and the economic powers conglomerate more and more, even as the means of production spin outwardly into a complex network.  I would have given this book 5 stars, but there are sections that could have been more concisely written.  They are easy enough to breeze through, so don't let that stop you from reading it. It is well worthwhile time spent.
B008602KQI|3.0|Having read all three of the books to this story, I was, of course, let down by the movie.  Had I not already known the story, I may not have been so disappointed in the disappearance of dialog and scenes that made this story such an adventure.  Movie left me guessing about what was going on because I already knew what should have been happening that didn't.  I still enjoyed watching the movie though and I would recommend it to non-readers.
B008602KQI|5.0|GREAT FLICK...CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUELS...THE BOOKS ARE EVEN BETTER! ALL OF THE ACTORS DID A GREAT JOB AND WERE VERY BELIEVABLE
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put the book down which was extremly dangerous since I started school two weeks ago and every chance I got, the book was back in my hands. :)
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This book was hard to put down.  King captured the essence of the time in history when life seemed simpler.  His brilliant account of how Lee Harvey Oswald's life evolved in the months and days before the assasination of JFK was truly masterful.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|The book took a short time to get used to however after you embrace the concept that it's from the 5 year old point of view, it's a good read.  It held my interest and at times I couldn't put it down.  There is closure at the end too.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS SERIES. DIDN'T WANT IT TO END. HOPE THEY COME BACK WITH MORE AND NEVER STOP...
B003UBTX72|4.0|As a Stones and Keith fan going back to when they started i for sure wanted to read his book. it's not a gripping tale and he's no great writer, but nevertheless enjoyable and interesting to get the inside story behind many songs and albums, and of what was going on all those wild years. by the second half of the book i was skimming a lot to get through names of who engineered what studio session and that kind of thing, but the earlier part is fun and you do get a picture of keith and his Life.
B000XPOB0M|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Played through w/out interruption of pauses for downloading. Easy purchase process:) love the selection I get w/my Amazon Prime membership!
B003Q6CUAI|3.0|A incredible amount of waffle cut to the basic diet and food values eg good bad etc so you can get a grasp as to whether or not commence the diet, let's face it that's the main reason for purchasing the book.<br />Little less how wonderful a person the author dietitian is and how obese his patients are,give us some solid data on succes failure side affect rate.<br />Wouldn't recommend to read.
B002MXO6L2|5.0|This was a fun flick from beginning to end. Nice and light very engaging.Woody and Scarlett were a delight to watch.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie and My nephew borrow and  it love it and he still hasn't brought it back.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|When ever I read a book about the Navy SEALS or Delta I expect it to start with several chapters dedicated to how hard their training is and how hard he men are.  The author shared some of these details but focused much more on the man, his family, his teammates and the unbelievable personal hardships that would have broken many others.  I made the mistake of starting the book around 6pm on vacation, I was not able to put it down until I was finished around 4am.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|pretty addicting game although it would be nice if you didn't have to connect with friends to complete goals I hare hugging people to play my games
B007R12TNQ|3.0|it was good to watch . Made me laught a few times. It downloaded real easy. The picture quality was great.
B008602KQI|5.0|I wondered whether the movie would do the book justice - that rarely happens.  Answer is \\"yes\\".  There were a few deviations, but not enough to detract from the story line.  I wondered how the film makers would translate the post-apocalyptic world of the book into images, and it was all done very well.  Can't wait for next movie!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I love Diana Krall, and this CD lived up to my expectations.  Since I love her, I recommend anything she produces!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The triology was very well written. It's not often I read novels that don't have a swatch of tartan or a man in a kilt, so it was a refreshing change. Everyone talked of how it read as a bit of porn, but I didn't see it that way. It was no more so than some of the other books I have read that are just listed as \\"Romance\\". I liked the fact that it showed how easy it is for some people to take advantage of those with a troubled mind and the struggle of those who love them go to get them back. To me that was the point in this story, but that's just me. And yes, I did even cry while reading.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Great product cost was awesome free can't beat that. I was looking for a calendar that I could use with no wifi and this is it. I don't have google calendar nor will I sign up to get it. I don't care about syncing with other calendars. I can put my info in and color code it. Love it would recommend to anyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists and turns in this novel.  You don't know until near the end what really happened!  I would recommend this book.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not very well written, but the story moves quick. A fast read. Not as dark as I expected but it tells a better story then the first.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's a great book! The story line is ever changing and easy to read along to. GREAT FOR ANYBODY, well maybe except kids, it's pretty cruel. It's much more intense than The Hunger Games.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|this DVD made me feel as if I were back in New York and watching it again on the boardway stage. the sound, picture, all<br />of it was great.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was ok, but there wasn't much of a story line.  I find Ana as stupid and he is just plain sick.  She blushed and flushed so much it made ME sick.  Sometimes twice on one page.  It got to be irritating.  I wish I would have highlighted all the flushing, blushing and then flushing more that was in this book and counted them.  Once in a while she turned red.
B0086700CM|2.0|this is good for a 10 year old boy--not necessarily an adult--i prefer word games or puzzles,  not a metaphor for my life.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Full of twists and turns.  Exciting until the very end.  A must read for book clubs for some great discussions.
B008N1LL42|4.0|Very well done. A different take on an alien invasion, with a solid mix of action and story. Characters are fun and tough. Really good movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|While this book hinted a lot at some of the same plot lines as 50 Shades of Gray, I was quickly drawn in and now await the sequel with much anticipation.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book! it was so good I finished it in 4 hours!!!!!!!!!!!!! it was just soooooooo good. I loved the other books too. can wait until the rest of the movies come out
B008N1LL42|5.0|I am a video nut.  I love all types of movies. but this one was spectacular...  it had it all.  action, adventure, even a little romance.  but the special effects were unbelieveable.<br />I watched it on my kindle fire and then on my computer.  couldn't put it down.  even took the kindle to the kitchen with me to make my sandwich.  hope they make more movies of this quality.  I now purchase all my movies and books at Amazon.com.  im not a geek but Amazon is turning me into a book\movie junkie.  The prices are better than the store and I live in a very out of the way place so the convenience is excellent.  I always recommend Amazon.com........
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I agree this is the best book I have read this year. I bought this book yesterday and I didnt put it down. Amazing storytelling. Addicting! Why have I not read anything by Blake before!?! This is a must read. I wish it wouldnt have ended but the ending was great. The entire book was a nonstop rush.
B008602KQI|3.0|I saw the Hunger Games in theaters and it was ok. I love the book and have read it 3 times. The second dvd with the special at least explain why the director changed things from the book. Hoping Catching Fire is better.
B005FISBTO|1.0|The rating for this is due to how Showtime handled this DVD distribution, not the show/episodes themselves which are much better than season 5.  WARNING - there is a 2 minute Advertisement for upcoming Showtime seasons that shows the ENDING OF SEASON 6.  I got burned on this same sort of advertising when they were promoting season 5 on TV when they showed how Season 4 ended (right after i purchased the Season 4 DVD).  My wife and I got the same canned response from Showtime about how it isn't their fault, which just goes to show you that they take no pride in the products they sell to us.  Maybe i should just call them up and ask them to tell me what happens in Season 7 so i don't have to worry about avoiding anything Dexter related until it comes out next year on video.<br /><br />Stay Classy Showtime!
B003PIS5XI|5.0|I loved this movie when it came out and have enjoyed it many times over the years. It is now time to introduce it to a new generation. All of my nephews in the 8-10 age range are getting this for Christmas. I hope they love it as much as I do. I think it is the perfect compliment to last year's gift - Flight of the Navigator, another great movie from the 80's.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is really good. The info is usually correct. Its the best one I have found. I would recommened this app for everyone to us. The only issue is you have to keep your location on at all times, which kills your battery.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|When I need to be going to sleep I think of all the bills and errands I need to take care of. I also seem to have nerves ready to explode as my husband snores beside me. I have tried hard to find peaceful music. FOUND IT! Relax Melodies app allows you to listen to a river; zen music or crickets and more. You will melt away to la-la land.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|I would not presume to add much to the reviews here, and indeed the reviews through the decades since this movie came out. It's Hitchcock, for heaven's sake; what more need be said? Classics are classics for a reason: they stand the test of time. This movie does that in spades.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I forced myself to continue with this book, expecting it to improve, but it did not, its just utter Crap
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had no idea what this book was about. I was just looking for something to read and saw this on the best seller list. I am not a prude but I have to say this is one of the most terrible books I have ever read. When they got to the bondage part I deleted the book from my Kindle. I shoud ask for my money back. If you are not into this sort of thing then buyer beware. I will be sure and research the next book I download.I should have done that with this book.<br />[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B008ASLK8A|1.0|Shut it off half way through. Stupid story lines and an insult to anyone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes stories. Wasted my money
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A well written tale of a \\"cast off\\" girl who emerges into womanhood with special talents that improve the lives of those she meets during her struggle to blossom. There is just enough mystery to keep the reader riveted to the page.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books. I have to admit it. I heard how everyone was saying how dark and dirty they were but I was unable to find that part of the book. yes they are different than the typical romance novels but they aren't as dirty as everyone made them out to be. To me, they are no different than a romance novel, they just have a dark streak. The first one was really the dirty one if you had to label them. The rest was a sweet story of two people falling in love that have a healthy sex life.
B008602KQI|4.0|I hope that the sequel gets better than this one. It was a little slow for me but still good. No a man movie but good to enjoy with the significant other.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Never read the book .... weird and sick movie and story line strangely with echos of George Orwell, 1984. I enjoy watching movies again & again over the years but I Probably will never watch this again. Should have rented it at Red Box instead of buying it.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I read book 1 and 2 of this trilogy because of the crazy hype that surrounds Fifty Shades. I had to know what was so good about these books. After reading through 2 I lost pretty much all interest in the series and only bought the final book to say I had finished it and also in the hopes that maybe it would get better. Unfortunately, it did not.<br /><br />I've had Fifty Shades Freed for a couple months now and it almost feels like homework to read it. I'm so bored of this tired plot line, or lack there of. All in all, book 1 was worth the read and book 2 wasn't bad, but by book 3 I'm way over it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved these books. I have to admit it.

B00846TTDG|5.0|An accurate portrayal of the men who serve and die in the name of our great country and are rarely given the proper thank you that they deserve
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|very convenient, I read the whole thing (again) on my droid cell phone.  Just a something to peruse here and there and in no time it was all read.  It's relaxing to have free access to classics.
B008602KQI|5.0|For those who have read the books then you will find that this film adaptation follows very closely to the original work. Obviously there are a few things omitted but I am not a purist and understand to include every detail from a book would require the movie to be 4 hours long.  That being said as a stand alone film those who have not read the books will be in for a treat. The story line is gripping and the actors really bring home the emotion.  Worth every penny of the purchase.
B00845PV16|5.0|I love amazon and the freedom of renting current movies at a great price. The quality is great in the convience of my home for movie night.
B002DD67XG|5.0|What can you say... like a moth to a flame... I grew up with the music and when I hear it again, after all these years, those memories still return.  Amazon makes it easy to find, preview and download.  A+
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Difficult to put down, so I read it really quickly.  An interesting story in a Lord of the Flies kind of way.  I can't wait to get the next book.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Reminiscent of Tomorrow When the War Began, it's startling to once again have a book invade one's thoughts while on the bus, at work, during conversations, and long after the last page has been turned.
B003E88TKS|4.0|Interesting movie about professionals who travel and live \\"other\\" lives while on the road.  Funny and yet sad.  I did enjoy the movie and thought that George Clooney did a great job.
B008M34INW|3.0|Not up to what Mel can and has done. It seemed to me that it lacked a believable story line. It is not a movie that I would ever watch twice.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I can't help but wonder how much life in North Korea is like the book implies.  Couldn't put it down for the first three quarters of the book, then the writing seemd to wander and was hard to follow.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|You will probably be disappointed with this adaptation.  The performances are flat, the design is unimaginative (especially of the capital and it's citizens) and casting is very hit-and-miss.  Woody Harrelson phones in a completely off target performance as Haymitch, who was one of the most interesting characters in the book.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book, go there first.  However I don't recommend the sequels, as they are disappointing.
B000I186FW|4.0|Entertaining, thought provoking film. We spent an evening catching up on a few older films....and found this among our choices. I do recommend it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I just downloaded this app today and I'm addicted already. I love the combination of relaxing music and the challenge of figuring out the puzzle.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I purchased this movie under the recommendation of my great niece.  Was she right or what!!!! It is a great movie and I am now reading the books and can't wait till the next movie comes out. I hope it is as good as the first one.  I thought the movie had a little bit of everything and is a great movie for the whole family.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|I thought it was cute - for those of us who grew up with these movies, it was a satisfying look back at your favorite \\"pie\\" kids.  There were some pretty hilarious moments, some just funny, and some were more nostalgic than anything else.  This is a fun movie that you will most likely only watch once, so I would recommend renting, not buying.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was completely mesmerized by this book.  The twists and turns created by the author  deserve high praise indeed...but as I saw in a brief review it is as if the author did not know how to end the book...so she just stopped writing.  I would definitely recommend this book and possibly someone else might be happy with the ending.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|This was perhaps one of the most celebrated movies and DVD releases of the year.  I have to say, for me , it was a let down.  Probably one of those things that should have stayed a book.  The storyline is interesting enough for the book, but as it moves to the big screen and you spend the next hour or so watching children run around and brutally kill each other for the entertainment of the wealthy governing class who watch on TV,and of course YOU the viewer, it is just not that interesting.  Special effects, scenery and all of the other things you go to see when there isn't a great plot to the story, just weren't there.  There are other movies, telling of a similar story - people being used to fight for the entertainment of the ruling class and to keep them in line while being under the control of said class - (Death Race, Rollerball, Gladiator come to mind).  All of them were adults, slaves or prisoners, not children who went around killing each other to provide entertainment.  Some of these movies had Academy Award level acting and special effects but not this.  I can handle a kid killing a kid every so often, especially if it were tied to an intriguing plot and/or special effects but child hunting/killing child for the good of his neighborhood is pretty much the entire movie.  And whereas you may be in to that kind of central theme, devoid of intriguing plot or visual excitement, and like to watch it, it's really not for me.
B008BM9L72|1.0|This book is very boring and extremely poorly written.  Trite rubbish and merely a vehicle for gratuitous sex. I was very disappointed considering the hype surrounding it.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|I have to be honest...I was expecting this movie to suck...but it didn't.  Without revealing too much, there were several hilarious moments that caught me off guard.  There were times when I laughed so hard, I had to pause the movie to catch my breath, and once I fell right off the couch.  The plot makes good sense with proper homage to the television program and plenty of surprise cameos to make this worthwhile.  This is one you can buy - you will want to watch it again some time!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book contained nothing but kinky sex.  The story line was lost in the bedroom and anywhere else they had sex.  This is not reality.
B00846REIS|5.0|Similar to Fifty Shades of Grey... But different too. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|very good book to read,for adult to read,i like this book,also the other 2 books too,i hope they make a movie out of these books
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game to past time and diffrrnt not your everyday game sometimes ducks waiting on thing to grow ext lol
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is an eloquent writer, she incorporacted humor and intellect in a way that captures your attention and refuses to let go. She opens herself to the reader with no a lack of shame allowing them to see her as a human despite her life in the spotlight. Stories of failed breast feeding and falling asleep during meetings she's truly fascinating.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|My writer-daughter recommended Flipboard to me, and I've used it almost every day since downloading it.  The intuitive interface and smooth operation really give it an aesthetic edge over point and click news sources.  I use it mostly for science stories on my tablet, and it delivered me a great one yesterday about the discovery that what was once thought to be junk DNA is mainly the on/off switches for genes!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|There have been only a handful of books, made into movies, that have ever been worth watching and this was not one of them. This movie appealed to those that read Suzanne Collins \\"The Hunger Games.\\" If you didn't read the book and you watched the movie you wouldn't get the full experience of what's happening, why it's happening and how it affects the participants.<br /><br />Personnally, I wouldn't suggest watching this film, but to read the series.
B004X4QW42|5.0|I think the first and second movie is the best.  I don't recommend watching in English.  You should watch in any other language.  Sub titles are better..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is addicting and cool. not to mention easy to play. the best part is there are clear instructions.
B008602KQI|3.0|Wish the movie had followed the book.  Wonder if the other 2 books in the series will be made into moviesl if so, will they follow the books.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|For anyone who has ever lost a loved one suddenly, this movie provides a possibility that you will be reunited someday. The concept that who and what you truly love is always there waiting for your return is uplifting and hopeful. Although the tragic loss of both her children and husband is heart wrenching, the depth of their love brought them all together in such a brilliant way.<br /><br />Although I love Robin Williams comedic talent, his dramatic accomplishments are so believable and on point, especially in this film. He is an incredible actor! This is an amazing film!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Before I got this app my kindle fire kept going off shutting down then I found it and tried it out after that LOVED it and it helped me charge it up.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Having a bit of a scientific background, this book made a lot of sense to me. However, parts can be a bit tough to get through due to the terminology and some concepts.<br /><br />That said, this is a must read if you aren't feeling up to par, have weight you'd like to lose and/or just want to eat healthier.<br /><br />My own story may not be spectacular but, in just a few weeks I have already lost weight, feel so much better than I have in a long time and random symptoms I've had for awhile are now gone. This is without starving myself or having to totally revamp my lifestyle. I've been reading labels more closely and eating better overall. It's interesting how some foods like eggs are not \\"forbidden\\" and others just need to be eaten in moderation. Dr. Davis makes a great case for eliminating gluten by examining the history of wheat and identifying the process that results in a person feeling like crud after eating it.<br /><br />I want to tell everyone the stats and facts Dr. Davis without sounding like an evangelist but, my weight loss alone is speaking volumes.<br /><br />If you are questioning whether or not to buy this book, I would say that at the very least, you will have a better understanding of what you are eating and how it is processed in your body. At the most, you could save your life.
B007MJKOY4|3.0|I expected this movie to be good and it didn't disappoint. It was an excellent period spy piece.<br /><br />That being said, though it wasn't a letdown, was not as impressed as I'd hoped to be.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is addictive! It's fun, easy to play (to a point), & it's easy to get into competing high scores with people you know (my brother hasnt beaten me yet!). Anyway, five stars, I love this game!
B001KL0WJW|5.0|The directors cut is different from the original. It has comic book touches in it. It really does't take away from the movie though. It still is a good movie to watch.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|I have been on many diets and had a diffcult time staying on them.  This plan has been easy to maintain and I have not experience hunger pains! And the weight has come off.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|Good easy read. A page turner. It's a bit predictable but still I enjoyed it. Good alternative to 50 Shades. What it's like to have a crazy stalker boyfriend
B008602KQI|5.0|After reading the 3 books, this movie about book 1 was a good approximation of the book itself.  We enjoyed watching it with our grandson who had not read the books.  He liked it \\"a lot\\"
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was pretty good.  Katniss character was excellent.<br /><br />Omissions/edits from the book leave the movie a bit lacking.<br /><br />Woody...surprisingly pretty good.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend and I loved it. I would recommend this book to any one.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|i loved this book and was very excited about the movie. When I saw it at the theater I liked it a lot... It just isn't a movie I will watch over and over. I believe the excitement around the books  and now movies is worth the hype so if you have not seen it, it's a must see for sure.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|This is really a cute game. Very challenging and a bit addictive.... it is great that there are daily gifts also.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This is such an inspirational book! While reading it and after reading the book I really felt the urge to get on and start organizing my space better.<br />There is so much clutter in our daily lives and I started to notice more and more things that I can do without, that are completely unnecessary. This book prompted me to cluttered my house and thus, I feel more cleansed and I better able to realize what is truly important in life and in our household. I highly recommend this book!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Since loading this application I've use it countless times while I'm out shopping to scan bar codes and find not just information and reviews, but I've saved tons of money discovering that those clearance tags really are not clearance tags.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I saw this movie on TV and fell in love with it.  It has romance, sword fights, good vs evil, not to mention a light comic air with the ghost.  I highly recommend it.  Plus I love the actors.  They do a great job!
0525953728|5.0|This is a MUST read! Mr.Bissionette seems like a very likable guy,its ashame his fellow teammates are against this book..Go buy it!!
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Jack Reacher - the very best character in fiction today!  Unbeatable twists and turns in the post-army adventures of the judicial vigilante, Jack Reacher, whose nomadic lifestyle leads him into his own brand of karmic delivery!
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were wonderful!  The story line behind it all wad grabbing me off my seat.  And my husband wasn't complaining about me reading all the time!  ;-)
B007IXGUG0|4.0|I am not a huge rap fan, but id say most of the songs on here are worth listening to. Like any album, some wont be that great, but overall its pretty good.
B007SGM084|4.0|Put off getting the books because I didn't want to read what I thought would be just a 'soft porn' book. (From other reviewers and word of mouth).  Instead I found that it was well written and I think I will be bereft when I finish them, even though I sometimes skim through the sex because it gets to be a little dramatic and unbelievable at times.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This movie was a very enjoyable action movie. Sherlock Holmes didn't really solve much until the end and it seemed out of nowhere. Still enjoyable, but not Sherlock.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|The author's rather unique use of foreshadowing made for engaging reading. We know what is going to happen from reading the first few pages which makes it enticing to find out the details of how such extraordinary events could have occurred. I found the two main characters disturbingly naive and lacking in courage even though they were just young teenagers. It seemed like there were better choices they could have made to make the best of a bad situation instead of just patient endurance. Completing the book satisfied my curiosity but left me feeling rather empty and uninspired. It's not a book I'd ever read a second time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am suprised that this book made the best seller list and so glad that I didn't purchase all 3 books when I ordered. I will not be ordering the next two books. I want it to end as it did in the first book and not go on.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Because most of us live our lives on the surface, even those with an established religious tradition, it is uncommon if not rare to experience the deeper things of the spirit. Anita Moorjani brings extraordinary light and hope to all who seek truth and are looking for genuine realization of what they have so long believed. Her journey can be yours. Do not miss this encounter with the divine--for the Kingdom is within, waiting.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I love country music but my daughter got me hooked to this song. Very talented!!! I would buy more of her songs.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Before I read this book I kept hearing that it's an erotica.. So I was hesitant in getting it because i thought, \\"damn another Zane and no real story.\\" I can honestly say I view this book and the two so differently from others. I view this as one hell of a \\"captivating\\" story. A page turner.. I see a blooming romance between a trouble young man and a naive young girl..
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I downloaded this game awhile ago.  I have enjoyed it thoroughly and want to let anyone who enjoys puzzle-type games know that it should not be passed up!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|When this game first came out there were already android versions for. 99 and for free. 4 months later and still for the kindle only this version is available. I dont mind paying for a game but Im not paying for one thats available (on android none the less) for much cheaper. Especially when reading that it takes the kindle version an extra month or more to get the new levels.. Just disappointing all around.
B008602KQI|5.0|Simply one of the best stories ever told! The movie is an excellent depiction of the book. It has humor, action and intensity that is very well filmed and scored. Definitely recommend purchasing the DVD, you will want to watch it more than once.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is a page-turning legal thriller that will leave you guessing in the end. It's a great discussion book for any book club!
B008476HBM|5.0|The print of this book is attractive as is the simple cover.  The size is standard but handy so I can put it in a tote or bookbag and have it ready for access whenever I  have a spare moment.  So far it is sturdy and doesn't look dog-eared even when it's been toted many places.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I did not like the free Angry Birds because the ad pop-ups would get in my way when I was trying to play the game.  The ad would block your view of the pigs, monkeys, whatever you were aiming to hit.  Very frustrating!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I needed a laugh. I really enjoyed watching this made me laugh so much. It was a light & funny movie. I believe the whole family should watch. It was so good I may end up buying it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell part II, just as addicting as the original Quell. With the same calming music, worth it just for the music, from the original.<br />Definitely a must as a FAOTD.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds Free is alright to play, it doesn't have as many ads Angry Birds Season.  I did go ahead and purchase the one that is Ad-free, it was worth $.99!
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I'm a big Marley fan so this was great to watch. I enjoyed learning where he came from & all he had to go through to get where he ended up. Made me love him even more.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games movie is a true representation of the Hunger Games novel.  The movie faithfully recreated the underlying feeling of the novel.  The action flix fans appear to be disparaging the movie because it is not a true action movie like Expendables 2, I say thank God for that.  If you liked the book you should like the movie.<br /><br />The book makes a point of the great contrasts between Capitol and the other segments of the Nation.  The movie clearly shows the same contrasts from subsistence level in zone 12 to the high tech high life in Capitol.<br /><br />Great movie try it you will like it.
B001I9WK14|4.0|Takes you back and revives those feelings and emotions that have long past. It now seems like a magical time in music. Great Album.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|It was a funny movie. Kinda of a slap stick comedy. It was an okay movie but I thought it would be better than it was but for the most part it did have some funny parts in there.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't want to read the Hunger Games books for the longest time, because I was sure I wasn't going to like them. I'm not one to jump on a band wagon and read a book or see a movie simply because it's what everyone else is into. Plus, I've never really liked books set in dystopian societies.<br />I ended up seeing the movie with a friend as something to do on a summer night, though, and decided that since the movie was pretty good, I might as well try out the books. I flew through the books and am currently finishing the third one.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is wonderfully done. It follows very closely with the book. Because I love it so much, I watched it again last night. However, this is not for little kids. I think it is too violent. I told my 12 year old he can watch it after he reads the book.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is not as good as the book BUT I still loved it! Amazing movie and a great cast.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|fun for me as well as my 4yr old.  screen freezes up occasionally and if you purchase acorns you apparently don't always get them?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have enjoyed this product (Solitaire) very much since I purchased it.  I especially like the variety of things it does when I win the game - very entertaining.
B00846REIS|4.0|I thought \\"Bared to You\\" was a great read! I am so excited to get the next book to see what happens!
B007KQXB2G|5.0|This episode is jam packed with unexpected twists and turns!  It makes you want the series to never end!  I am addicted to this show and can't wait to see season 6!
B005R32L66|5.0|works great would recommend to everyone... works on my coby 7\\" droid... I use skype as my home phone and it works on all pc's tablets in my house.
B004XZR63M|3.0|This is a great first book of a 3 part series .... I have also purchased and read the guide to Investing and in short the above book is far better and cheaper.<br />My advice is buy this book but none of the others. To me it seems like the first book is written as a great ''taster' book to get you hooked on the concepts and theories that have worked for the author - if you want more of a 'taste' the next book is more expensive but in my view not a better book - For instance the guide to Investing is repetitive and badly written. The author could have written a book at a third of the size and made exactly the same points.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|It's as bad as the first one I bought it to see if there was any difference none what so ever nothing but sex thrill...........
B00866H7SS|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book after the wonderful read of Fifty Shades, I must however say that I am struggling, I'm not pruny and do have an open mind, but I just cant get past all the swearing.<br /><br />yes I know fifty shades and many more books have swearing but it is not used all the time, I will keep trying to read this book I do however prefer books with less swearing just my personal prefrence.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was awesome!!!!!!!!!!! I didnt want the book to finish. Now I am in love with Christian Grey. I recommend this book to everyone.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Dexter continues to be one of the best shows on American TV.  What an ending!  Each season just keeps getting better.  I cannot wait to see what happens next.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|English is not my languaje, so you have to forgive my spelling and grammar. I enjoyed the book; it is not a master piece, buy it is well build, the characters are amazing, hope I could do something like that. To much sex scenes, I liked the 2 first but got bored with the rest. Other than that it is a beautiful story, great fantasy and great Christian Grey. I read the three books, first time I read in English, wonderful experience.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I'm not a fan of Brad Pitt but this one was very, very interesting !  How Germany continues to invade France !
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love to listen to the various melodies & sounds when wanting to relax or prior to falling asleep at night.
B008602KQI|5.0|I don't know why writers always have the human civilization in destruction, or some other weird situation. I don't know WHAT the point was in having a bunch of teenagers go out into the woods and kill each other? To me this film didn't make too much sense.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|We bought the first season of \\"Modern Family\\" since we had not previously watched this program.  It is well written and very funny.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an easy book to read, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The characters were easy to follow, and the plot twist was great.
B004SBULWE|4.0|This works to shut down all non needed programs. It also works in the background with no prompts from the user. There is a small box that lights up telling you what number of apps have been shut down. Including the amount of memory saved. Kind of a cute side note it says memory's no big deal I found it cute. The only need to push the button yourself is when you need to save power (RAM) right away. Even then you can do it with no need to open it just press the button on the screen one step instead of two.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I am new to Amazon, gifted with a Kindle recently from my bestfriend who is a great reader.  My first purchase is A Discovery of Witches and I was captured! Great story, great writing.  Deborah Harkness brings you right into the world of Diana Bishop! Can't wait to read the next book in the series.  I highly recommend this Read!
B008602KQI|5.0|Top notch film making here.  Pitch perfect casting.  Excellent effects. awesome soundmixing and effective use of soundtrack.  Get it.  Watch it. Enjoy!
B008602KQI|5.0|I read all the books and missed seeing it at the theater.  Bought it through Amazon on pre-order.  I got a free digital copy from Amazon as a bonus for pre-oredering the dvd!! Thanks Amazon!! Loved it!!!
B000IKM8UM|5.0|Not quite HD or BluRay quality.  The quality is that of old DVD at best.  But the movie is excellent.  Denzel Washington never upsets and the music is amazing.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed the book but the ending just left you hanging wondering where the rest of it was. Would love to have a continuation?
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Well written.  It was refreshing and rewarding to read about an older adult, not a 20 something, leave his routine life to explore the outer world and his inner thoughts.  Highly recommend it.  KD
B004XUMMFE|5.0|What can I say.  Firefly is one of the greatest tv shows ever.  The shows that come close to matching it are few and far between.  It was a crime how shabbily the show was treated by fox. I wish that they would make more content for the show in other mediums.  I would love to see a firefly video game.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Christian Grey & his 50 shades are brilliant, different & a must read! Once you start reading you get absorbed into the story & you are unable to put the book down!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|There is obviously strong views re: this book. I don't know what Matt may have given away that was unpatriotic but the stories were fascinating. It was good to finally hear what happened. I was so proud of our SEALS! Hopefully if any retribution is due Matt he will get it...otherwise I think it wrote a very well written book and it was a pleasure to read. I will only say I hope he wrote it for the reasons he states in the book.
B008XG1X18|3.0|not bad enough for a free app...but I wish it would not freeze and prompt error messages every time I use it
B0049U4INC|4.0|My college class used this book as a project, and I learned a lot about how to connect and enchant others to listen to what you are saying. I will be reviewing this book in preperation of my business plan.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I really enjoyed the 50 Shades trilogy, although I think the author could have cut back a little on the \\"intimate\\" scenes. Overall, I would recommend the series to a friend.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book felt like wrapping yourself in a blanket on a cold day. It's slow to get you warm, but once it does, you don't want to come out from under it. The writing was beautiful and the characters were flawed and broken, but realistic and redeemable.<br /><br />This journey isn't so much about Harold walking 600 miles to see Queenie, a former colleague stricken with cancer. It's more about the journey itself, what Harold learns about himself along the way, and how he touches others when they hear his story. He believes that if he makes this trip on foot, then she will hold on for him.<br /><br />Tidbits are revealed slowly about Harold's life -- about his distant relationship with his son, how his marriage with Maureen slowly soured, and how his retirement is not what neither of them expected. But this book is about hope, too. And that's why I enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />While this is not a book I would have normally chosen on my own, I'm glad it was selected for book club!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|its great I have Been useing it to sleep with I just set the timer and go to bed. I just love it.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|This movie wins at crossing space, blending eras, and weaving anachronistic technologies with a thick and explicative narrative. There is no wonder this movie spawned three TV series with hundreds of episodes. The two protagonists accompany each other well in a rich and realistic way: One the tragedy hardened bad-ass who is quick to quip but not quick to discount an idea, and the other a disposed of geek driven so much by his own curiosity he is immune to cowardice.<br />The movie also has an epic setting and is action packed. It's easy to watch more than once!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I learned about this book on the TV show \\"The View\\" and was excited that Whoopie Goldberg loved and recommended it.  I was so disappointed.  I didn't even finish the book because I was so bored with it.  I read almost half of it and kept waiting for it to get better but I finally gave up.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B002DD67XG|5.0|This is by far my favorite album of James Taylor's.  As soon as I hear the first note, all calm comes over me and I am relaxed.  A must have for James Taylor fans..
0525953728|1.0|As a cheap thriller: indeed, a cheap one.  As an insight into SEAL operations: sightless.  As a historical account: worthless since most of historically important data are classified.  In summary, a book of limited value (Marcinko's stories of SEAL daring-do are so MUCH better, if for no other reason than for the crusty humor and eloquence of style), based on a clear  intent to improve the size of thhe author's retirement fund.  if you need to read a more \\"factual and in depth review\\" of Bisonette's opus minor, read those with one star only.  Most are written by the former members of the Armed Forces, and their cumulative verdict i(and sentence) is that of a \\"dishonorable discharge.\\". Personally, I'd add penal servitude for conduct \\"grossly unbecoming.\\" By authoring this strikingly self-serving book, CPO Bisonette indicates not only that he does not grasp the concept of political criticism (to which he is entitled), but, more disturbingly, that he either misunderstood or never got the meanng of the word \\"to serve\\", i.e., the essence of the moral and ethical underpinnings of every active or retired member of the Armed Forces.
B0080JG2D2|3.0|If you do not have this CD, it's an incredible release, so you would do good in picking this up.  I had heard that this was a new transfer from the master tapes, thus I picked this up to replace my well played original master CD.  I must be honest that I cannot tell much of a difference between this an the original release.  I'm an audiophile snob and have over 80K invested in my sound system, yet can't tell a difference between this an the original release.  For most people I do not see a reason to invest in this \\"Gold\\" disc if you already have the original CD release.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this book a lot.  I heard that it wasn't as good as the first but I gave it a try anyway.  I was so happy I did, it was a great book.  It as full of suspense and written as well as the first one.  I would recommend this book to anyone who liked the first.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Sparks has done it again, KUDOS.  Waiting for the movie outcome for this one. Characters and setting believable.  Story line is inviting and warm, with a bit of thrill and tears.  I recommend it to others.
B0035G0U2O|5.0|This movie had me on the edge, it held my attention all during the movie, I didnt get up for anything during the whole movie. That says something for me. I always get up and down and feel the need of something to eat and drink, but this movie, I did not. I sat and watched it all the way, and even felt my self in the movie with them. I enjoyed it very much. Thank you, for no foul language, and a great story.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Riordan is incredibly gifted at using historical figures such as the gods of Olympus, in order to tell a thrilling story. The Heros of Olympus is a fantastic continuation of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. I can't wait for the next book in October.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I picked these up because I like to run and thought some lightweight headphones would be more comfortable for longer runs. I was wrong. These are indeed extremely lightweight but that's not a good thing. They never stay in place and I am constantly readjusting them. They always feel like they are about to fall off of my head. It's very annoying and I have already stopped using them for this reason.<br /><br />If you're considering some lighter headphones for working out with, it's just not worth it to save a gram here or there in weight. Headphones like these are never really heavy in the first place, so just get some normal ones and skip these.<br /><br />Sound quality was fine. I don't expect theater quality sound from any pair of cheap headphones.
B00297FEUS|3.0|I ordered this to re live my 80's days and the love for the music,but after I received it,I noticed the sound quality was terrible,pretty much like my cassette i had back in the 80's!  Found out after reading the reviews some bad copies got released without the bands knowledge,I saw on one of the reviews to try the label rhino records,and they would send me a decent copy of it,I've sent them about 5-7 e mails with no response,anything else I can do??? Would really like to get a remastered copy as I thought I was buying!
B006HAPY26|3.0|I wrote a review of how in the cherub series the books get worse and worse as you go on in the series. Well this second book is a clear example, as I was very hooked with the first book but not the second one or third, fourth and so on.
B00622B3MY|3.0|We enjoyed Cars 2, but comparing it with the first one, definitely enjoyed #1 for our kids. We thought the amount of bullets, missiles, fighting was a bit much for our son (4).  The pace of the first cars was definitely more his speed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was definitely a different read for me. I usually read adult urban fiction, however, this was a page turner for me. It's a love story with a twist. Had I known how much I would've liked book one, I would have just bought the trilogy from the beginning. The sex script was not what most would consider doing but still had me wanting to read more and looking at my husband like \\"come here right now\\". Very detailed insight on the main characters' personalities made understanding the sex script better no matter how bizarre some may feel about their choices of foreplay. I could go on and on but this one you just have to see for yourself.
B002RI9S2Y|4.0|I read this book when I was only nine, and it was the first book that  I got hooked into. It is a pure classic fantasy book for children.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Great music from James Taylor and Great deal from Amazon.com. Many Hit songs James Taylor sings like \\"Fire and Rain\\" and \\"How sweet it is\\".
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I was able to stay away from this books for a while as I thought all the hype was excessive.<br />Then I thought, what the heck.. I'll try the free sample.. and I was hooked. Everything from the world description to the characters made me wanting more and I bought the full book immediately.<br /><br />Sure, there is a bit too much focus on the action and is a bit unrealistic at times, but it still is a great book that you'll want to read very fast!
B005D9MUWY|3.0|The app is okay, but actually the predictive text in the free version seemed far more accurate. The paid version is so inaccurate that I'll probably uninstall it and go back to the older, free edition.
B007MG360G|5.0|great and wounder ful game to play.try this is great you'll enjoy it.great coms.try to get them all and you'll have fun with it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It  kept my interest with its many twists and turns. Well written and a fun read.
0393088774|3.0|Most reviewers will either love this book on ideological grounds or hate it on ideological grounds. I guess I fall into a third camp.<br /><br />\\"End This Depression Now\\" is cogent and forceful. Krugman makes a pretty airtight case for his policy proposal, addressing everything such as why distribution of debt matters (i.e. households vs governments), why some European countries did better than others following the crisis, and why inflation conspiracy theories are nonsense.<br /><br />Despite being a lean and meaty book (Krugman's writing style is fantastic and concise), the book is not consistently thought provoking. His facts and figures are nice, and his arguments are dare I say correct, but as an avid reader of his blog and as someone who reads a diversity of material, I feel like I've heard most of this before. I find Paul Krugman's blog to be far better reading material than this book; on his blog he tends to impart his impeccable political wisdom combined with his loosely restrained penchant for arithmetic. In this book he is more restrained on both his political insight and his technical knowledge. I wanted to read a book with numbers, and with passages that makes some sense of political madness. For the most part, I got neither. I understand he wrote the book to connect to a common audience, but one can't help but think his smarts would be put to better use if he wrote just a bit more technically, easy enough for a fairly well-educated non-economist to understand and strong enough to be a valuable reference, instead of a primer to Krugman's ideology.
B000FC0ZEO|3.0|Thus is a good read, but I find it extremely detailed and wordy. I would like to see adequate descriptions, but emphasis on conversation.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|For the first time I had a chance to see all the season 1 episodes and view some that I did not have the opportunity to see previously.  This was such a groundbreaking (space breaking) program that changed the world (universe) of Sci-Fi Television.
B00456H5LC|4.0|This was really nice.<br /><br />The flow was right on point and well composed. I am looking forward to his next project to see if he can follow it up.
B0083L22U4|4.0|I have been a huge fan of Ultravox since their first days with Dennis Leigh (John Foxx). At first I was disappointed by the change to Midge Ure as front man, but their stylish work, 'Vienna', etc. very quickly won me over. This latest effort has all the style and virtuosity of earlier work, but is basically all ballads. 'Rise' and 'Hello' are great tunes, but overall the songs are slow, downbeat and lack the power of previous favourites like 'Sleepwalk', 'Accent on Youth', 'The Voice', etc. If you are a fan of their more lyrical and introspective songs you will surely enjoy this new release. New listeners should not miss hearing previous releases from their heyday.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful app which has helped me through many a Bilbe class. Perfect as an exegetical resource or for those who are curious about the various translations out there.<br />My only disappointment with this app is that not all of the versions offered are available to be downloaded and read offline.<br />Other than that, it's a great tool for any Christian or seeker of Truth.
B001V5CIHQ|4.0|We watched this with our kids (ages 2 and 6). We all enjoyed it. My 2 year old isn't much of a movie watcher yet but loved the crocodile and Tinkerbell. My 6 year old was totally engrossed. We liked the characters and the effects. We would watch it again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books r amazing! I have been hooked since the first chapter! It took me 4 days to finish the second book because I couldn't put it down! And w 4 kids that's fast lol! I have all 3 books on my kindle fire and I usually don't reread books but I can definitely see myself rereading these! I love fifty shades!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|You cannot stop to read it....<br />It is a very well written book. You will miss it at the end
B000HF6XV8|5.0|This movie was a favorite of mine when I was little. 20 years later and I still love every minute! This film will please the whole family with an uplifting plot and interesting characters. If I could I would give it 6 stars.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I LOVE this movie. So I pre-ordered the DVD and Amazon gave me instant streaming on Amazon video. I watched that immediately the next day, even before the DVD arrived. The quality of instant video and blue-ray are great. There is another disc with some good extra stuff on it.
B008M34CSI|3.0|Nice but not spectacular special effects, mix with an average action story with a little si-fi thrown in for good measure.
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought the casting was excellent.  The movie did an excellent job of translating the book onto screen.  I enjoyed it.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie, was very entertaining, would make you jump out of your seat at times.  I would definitely recommend it for viewing, the violeence is well subdued by director.
0143119680|4.0|In \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" historian Deborah Harkness deftly interweaves  fantasy, the history of alchemy, mystery and romance to tell the story of Professor Diana Bishop.  Wonderfully picturesque descriptions of characters and settings engage the reader's imagination from the start. With a story so real yet surreal, this novel gets harder and harder to put down.  But it is only the beginning of the story...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This title is so wonderfully written, I had to finish reading the series. I just wish it could last forever!
B0014EU5XI|4.0|For all lovers of ZZ TOP, or new, this is a great selection of some of their classics. A taste to get more of their music, both early, popular, and recent.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is excellent. I am not a big fan on reading but this book has changed that. Once I got pass the first two chapters I could not put this book down. It was very easy to find myself still reading at 2 in the morning. This book will definitely open your mind and leave a smile on your face.
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you wanna get in shape and get your body used to the basic exercise and heart rate it should be used to, this is an awesome workout DVD. It might be a bit tough in the beginning if you're not really used to working out, but that's the whole point. It pushes your body step by step to get to where it should be. There are 3 stages so once you feel your stamina is built on the first stage, move on to the next. Your body needs to be challenged in order to are results! If you feel some muscle pain, you're doing it right. I personally use the McDavid waist trimmer during the workout and I sweat 3 to 4x  more in my midsection. Good luck everyone!
B0044WQHYI|5.0|I'm a fan of the halloween franchise so I just say to hell with the remake stick with the classics.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|This is the best movie done by Tim Burton, definitely a classic. It was one of my favorites when I was just a kid and I still love it now.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I found the first book in this trilogy interesting.  I moved on to the 2nd book thinking this story line would move on and the \\"focus\\" would be less on the S&M - not.  Some friends on fb said to hang in there as the 3rd book would explain everything - wow; how disappointing.  Again, practically every other page was more S&M (getting really boring!)and not really much of a story line.  I was really hoping for (and deserving of) some really crazy weird twist to the end of this trilogy.  I would totally recommend this book if you're just looking for ideas on S&M with no real story.  My time could have much been spent reading something like Gone Girl or Defending Jacob.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Overall, I thought that the movie does a pretty good follow-up job from the first movie. There was just something about it that seems to leave you wanting, or should say, expecting more. As I said, the movie does a decent job for a sequel, that in itself is a victory considering how many lousy sequels are out there. But if you're wanting a movie that is challenging or is a blockbuster smash, this isn't it; however, if you're wanting a movie that is a great way to just relax and let your hair down with, then you'd probably enjoy this one. It's easy to follow, simply to understand, and unfortunately, the ending is pretty predictable if you're watching the movie and not having an ADD moment. So, why the 3 stars? It's a pretty okay movie,(would probably work for a date night movie) but I expected more and it just wasn't what you'd call, \\"overly impressive.\\" Hope this is helpful.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Steven King does it again with this book.  He makes you think while you are reading and entertains you with his opinion of what might of been if history had been/could be changed.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I love Philippa Gregory and this one did not disappoint!. lots of history with her own fresh take on everything Can't wait for the next one!!!
B008IJTFYW|1.0|I can't get this to download or install on my LG Optimus V phone, good thing it was the FAOTD or I'd be asking for a refund. Sorry
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy was amazing! I don't usually Read books like this, but I can just read and reread Fifty Shades of Grey forever! Absolutely fantastic. The way the author writes is breath taking and once you start to read the books you don't want to put them down. Well done!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne does and excellent inscription of the characters.  They are alive, believable and full of humanity.  You can't wait to see what next event will bring and how the charters will react.  Of course you are immediately wanting to read the third and final book on the last page of this book.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Well I've just gotten started with it, it's fun to look through pages and pages of interesting things, but is that all there is to it? I don't really know what to do with it.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott's book really opened my eyes to the direct correlation between eating and running.  I knew there were linked but his amasing recovery from monster runs just by changing his diet convinced me there must be a direct link.  I don't know that I will ever be as dedicated to diet as he is - just can't afford it- but I hope to make changes
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Great app for kindle fire just as good as any. Youtube app that ive used works great!buy it you wont be diappointed
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Beautifully written, this book really opened my eyes as to how lucky I am, and how I should not take my family for granted. I had never thought about how Internationally adopted children might have a yearning for their homeland, but this was conveyed well throughout the story.<br /><br />I loved how we saw the contrasts of the families and how and watched then unfurl and then weave together.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend for anyone who likes to read about lifestyles in different countries.
B008602KQI|5.0|Such a Great Movie. Loved the cast, especially Jennifer Lawrence. I could not put the book down until I finished it. The movie lived up to the book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game definitely keeps you on your toes. Lots of levels, some of them are very challenging. I myself haven't beaten the last level on the first pack and I don't see it happening anytime soon.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was a great adaptation of the must read book. The acting, especially from Jennifer Lawrence, Lenny Kravitz, and josh hutcherson, was superb. A must see.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was really good, and it should give us food for thought, imagine if the rich took control, we the not so lucky would have to sacrifice our children, but would we.<br /><br />Anyway the Hunger Games was an awesome movie, but the book was even better, I can't wait to see the rest of the Hunger Game movies.  Bravo Hunger Games
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Awesome, just awesome. This book is hard to put down. I would recommend this and all others in the series to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Mind numbing drival.  It's all i can do to get thru the last book.  I keep hoping for some devastating events to take place in the lives of these caracters.  Playboy is better written.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Compulsory reading for anyone who is worried about weight gain, gastric reflux and high blood pressure. Suddenly you will know why some foods make you feel sickly and bloated. A  well written and informative discussion.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Well written and executed.  A real page-turner.  I highly recommend.  This book is a departure from Stephen King's usual fare.
B004NS710C|4.0|Fairly realistic plot.  A dopey mistake that could lead to massive disaster... kind of like the upcoming election!  Two of my favorite people, too.  Plus, Denzel's the good guy again.  Redemption at the end without everybody dying.  What a relief!  LOL
B00846REIS|5.0|I have only read half the book and I cant wait for the second one to come out. Very well written and believable. I read 50 Shades of Grey twice, wonder how many times I will read these??
B008KPDKAE|5.0|Great film! Very funny but real premise and obstacles.Not cheesy,really fun well done romantic comedy with wonderful lead actors and very funny supporting cast.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Was wonderful, took 20 or so pages to get into but was shocking up to the last page.. Even after you find outwho dunnit  theres still more twist!!!:)
B007A6XLDU|5.0|Very nice little program. I really enjoy using it the paid version is got a lot more functions than the free version has but the free one is alright
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Once again Lee Child takes you on a wild ride with amazing characters and a great plot. When I need a break from the grind of daily life I know Jack Reacher will take me there. I savor these Lee Child books like dessert to the rest of my reading because I know just how good they are.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I lost a lot of sleep over this book, as I stayed up late each night unable to put it down! I love a book that makes you really ponder the premises put forth in the book. I also enjoyed the fact that, while I didn't want the book to end the way it did, I realize that it really couldn't have ended any other way and stay true to the characters within. Great read! One of the best in years (and I am a librarian, so that is saying a lot).
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Mr. Taubes has authored numerous well documented ground breaking books on nutrition, diet and health.  In \\"Why We Get Fat\\" he debunks many stubborn myths about what makes us fat...many of them based on just plain common sense.  The real villain, at the root of many of our health problems including obesity, is over consumption of all kinds of foods, but chiefly highly refined carbohydrates. One of the great fallacies of recent nutrition \\"science\\" is the demonizing of dietary fat.  Replacing nutritious fatty acids with factory engineered \\"low fat\\" junk food has logically led to the substitution of refined carbohydrates (the real \\"junk\\" in junk food) for healthy fatty acids.<br /><br />If you get reasonable regular exercise, limit calories, and above all, stop eating empty sugar and starch calories, our obesity and many other health issues like type 2 diabetes and heart disease will go away.  No magic pills.  Just application of sound, basic nutritional principles that have been proven to work.<br /><br />Although Mr. Taubes' writing style here is appropriate to the subject matter, it is by no means dry reading, and at times is entertaining as well.  Thorough documentation is present throughout the book, which adds even more credibility to the book's content.<br /><br />A must read for anyone who is either struggling with obesity and overweight, or who knows someone who is.  I guess that's pretty much everyone.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|Great acting; you can almost feel the despair of Fassbender's character. This I believe is what you would call a \\"character study\\" film so don't go looking for a plot. I plan on watching it again just to be sure I missed nothing. The NC-17 rating is a farce; it could have passed for an R-rated movie.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|While I must admit that, as an instructor, I had to read the first book in the series because it is a required reading for our Freshman Success Seminar, I quickly moved on to books two and three.  Suspense and curiosity all tied together with a messy little love triangle, and unanswered questions kept me going.  What will happen to the districts?  The capitol?  Who will Katniss choose?<br /><br />Book three started out with the same up-close experiences that we enjoyed and feared throughout the first two books.  The districts move in on a revolution behind the reluctant leadership of a heroine who knows the struggles facing the poorer districts,and is willing to sacrifice her life for her family, friends, and the betterment of Panem.  As readers, we were right there in the trenches with the rebels, Peacekeepers, and laymen alike.  Sharing their hunger, their pain, their fear and hope.  And then, bang!  Everything stops.  We are removed from the first hand, close up feel of the battle, left gazing through a fog at the lives we have come to learn so much about, and left gasping for air somewhere along the perimeter of the story only to come back chapters later to find that it's over.  The choices we so eagerly anticipated, the heart wrenching decisions that we should have been a part of were taken away from us and decided somewhere in the periphery by someone other than the one person (Katniss) to whom the choices actually belonged.<br /><br />I felt cheated; as though someone stole the most essential chapters and left me with an incomplete copy.
B008602KQI|4.0|As far as book adaptations go this movie does a pretty good job.  It's definitely not perfect, but it's a good representation of the book.  I recommend you read the books first and then check this movie out.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Heared a lot about the book<br />So I picked it up at a special price<br />Found it to be well written and a good read think all women should read
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a challenging and fun little time waster.  My 3 year old can play it too, so dual purpose!
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Fantastic quotes and very poetically written book. Interesting story as well, definitely worth the read. I recommend taking a spin through the book
B007IXWKUK|5.0|At first I was a bit surprised by the detailed sex scenes,  as I continued to read on I found this story to be about two people who fought to find love and to learn to love themselves.  A beautiful trilogy about love, relationships and redemption!!
B005UKI1TW|5.0|Bocelli shares his stage with a number of top singers -- all accompanied by the NY Philharmonic Orchestra (Alan Gilbert, conductor) and Westminster Symphonic Choir. The mixture of classical and pop music has wide appeal for the variety of tastes of a huge NY Central Park crowd. I can't stop watching the DVD!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Absolutely love jetpack joyride. Would have given it 5 stars if the kindle fire touch screen wouldn't register a tap occasionally when none was made.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|Very predictable, most of the was descent. There were a couple really funny scenes. The highschool reunion night was really dumb.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I recently purchased Raven's Shadow Book one: Blood Song, & have been asked how many stars I would give it.<br /><br />If the maximum number of stars is 10, then I would give it a 11 :)<br /><br />Its been a long time since a book has totally enthralled me, I couldn't put this book down. It has a depth that few writers ever achieve & simply transports you to another world, of action, intrigue & magic.<br /><br />I cannot wait for book two.
B003EY62II|1.0|We couldn't watch movie in the kindle.  It kept freezing up and I had to reboot every time.  Saw maybe a minute of movie.  Will not buy any more movies for kindle.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Yeabsolutely a must read. Enjoyed this book to the point I read it in one day. Caught my attention immediately.  Nice little love story that held my interest. If you like to read romance novels, you will not be disappointed with this book.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|3/4 of the way through the first book I was very upset with the death of a major (and my personal favorite) character, but the remainder of the material easily made up for it. A solid choice if you are a fan of the genre.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. Couldn't put it down once i started reading it. The story between them was just great and and kept you reading it and wanting more. Once i finished the book i was like crap i gotta read it again. so i did. I can't wait for her next book coming out. I will definitely be reading it.
B002PA8Q1S|2.0|KNOWING WHO THE MAIN CHARACTER IS NOW AND THE ROLE HE PLAYS IN BATMAN LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S LEARNED A LOT SINCE THIS MOVIE. ITS NOT BAD,BUT ITS NOT GREAT... IT'S ENTERTAINING AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S UP AND COMING ACTORS TRYING TO PAVE THEIR WAY. COULD HE DO A BETTER JOB TODAY DOING THE SAME ROLE? YES, I BELIEVE HE COULD.
B007UXTG8M|4.0|I liked it.  Had to really think the story line or the under lining issues of these people but it was good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A truly enjoyable read.  The characters were very well developed, each one intersting and complex.  You never know what was going to happen from chapter to chapter.  Without giving away the end it was very unexpected.  My book club loved it.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is very well done. It's story is very sad and I cry when I watch it. It sticks pretty close to the book and the actors and actresses do a fabulous job. If u like death and action this is the movie for u.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Well it was a little less interesting than I had hoped still pretty entertaining. Overall in my book it's a one time watcher, but well worth the one time.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I rented this for my wife, and streamed it through my PS3. I paid for the HD version. About 40 minutes in, a message came up that it had to switch to standard, due to my connection. I let it switch to standard, and the quality was pretty poor. I restarted it in HD, fast forwarded to the same spot, and had no other problems. As for the movie itself, it was pretty solid. I didn't think I'd like it, but I did. In fact, I liked it enough to borrow the books from my daughter. I recommend the books highly. As always, there is some good stuff the movie leaves out. The mutts that chase them at the end are MUCH cooler in the book. And Cato, poor Cato, his on screen death is much kinder than his demise in the book. Random final thought: favorite scene in the movie is when Katniss is waiting with Cinna for the games to start, when the timer gongs, she turns, and looks so scared, trembling. I just thought that was a great acting scene for her. That's it, long review, I know. Final point of reference, I'm a 38 year old, white, male.
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC news Kindle edition is an excellent product.  It is easy to use and allows selection of source information and easy interface to look at the story in more detail.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|Of course it is not the same as having my laptop open and typing in the full version of work or excel, but it works wonderfully and is very easy to use. I highly recommend it at only $15. I was easily able to type up an entire document in it and transfer it to my computer.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Found book 2 to be very much like book 1, no suprises. The writing is not the best. Subject matter is exciting and story flows well. Seems that the writer is following a standard story line and all the expected twists and turns are there. It is just that they are expected.
B007SGM084|5.0|could not put down until all three books were read.! A lot of sex but to find out why the young man became a dominant was serious .Things like this happen to our young men and young ladies every day!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|ok . .. . .. ive used this app fr a few days . .. . .. ITS FRIGGIN AWESOME! !!! !! ! !!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love this app, when it works right.  Half the time it won't open and it has to be force closed, then re-opened. Other times pictures won't load or it freezes.
B005ILYWN2|4.0|My son and I really enjoyed this quirky ( subject matter wise ) movie. It has such a interesting 'hook' in that Trolls are real in Norway, and the government has to muddle through managing them in the inept fashion governments have. Even watching the film with subtitles never really drew me out of the immersion of the piece, and the special effects are better than I expected. The actors hold up their end of the bargain as well, and the actor playing Hans really does a great job selling the idea he's a tired old grump with an unpleasant job.
B001V5CIFI|4.0|I enjoyed Nanny McPhee as an adult because of the comic timing between Colin Firth and Emma Thompson.  The children are quite exageratedly precocious and the vivid colors give the illusion of being in a fairy tale, or the children's book that it is.  Fun for kids with life lessons easily put forth, and enough plot for parents to enjoy.
B004NS710C|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but it turned out to be very gripping and touching. Loved the character's interaction with each other and with the action at hand. Great film, I'd recommend to anyone!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Excellent series! You never know what'll happen! Love damons character and I love the plot. It gives you the best of both worlds.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|This is the first book that awakened in me a true search for the spirit. At first blush it is a simple, straightforward read that can be of immediate physical value as well.<br /><br />I am immensely greatful.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I read the book on a beach in 3 days... The story takes you in immediately and it feels like you are part of the Enzo's family.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Very bizarre but loved it. Could not put the book down! Loved the romance and quirkiness, rather entertaining! Think I've fallen for 50.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Liked playing this version of Mahjong.  It was fun with interesting designs.  Don't get to play much because my grandson, is always on my kindle playing.
B0085A9J18|4.0|When a SWAT team tries to raid a tenement, that's also a stronghold for a crime lord, they quickly find themselves out-numbered, out-gunned and under attack and a mission to capture a major criminal suddenly becomes a fight for survival.<br /><br />Forget about plot, forget acting, and forget characters; `The Raid Redemption' is all about adrenaline-pumping, smack-bang action and, on that front, it delivers commendably because, let's face it, it doesn't have much else going for it.<br /><br />As the leading man, Iko Uwais is amazing and it's hard not to pump your fist in the air whenever he launches into action, delivering some well deserved comeuppance to ruthless criminals dumb enough to get in his way (pretty much all of them). The guy is in top form and his fighting skills are impressive to watch on screen.<br /><br />The action itself is fast and oh so bone-crunching brutal; guys get their heads slammed against walls, backs get snapped, limbs are broken and people get stabbed several times in the blink of an eye, I winced every time something painful happened and yet I enjoyed watching the violence. I haven't felt this way since seeing `The Protector' with Tony Jaa. This is a film the action-junkies will eat up; just remember to check your brain at the door.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|My son is really into this and I must admit, his fever has caught on to me as well.  I like the different levels and challenges and we have both passed more time with this game than I will admit.  Only thing - amazon sent me an email saying a free update for the space HD was<br />available for download but I have been unable to find it to download.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good selection of games. Wish you didn't have to unlock everything to get to the next game but overall it is good.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a easy to use app for your Kindle Fire.  It was quick to install and has made \\"e-baying\\" mobile. Best of all it was free. I rate this  a 5 star app.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|Tower defense type game... you pick a mix of towers to stop things coming at you in a line...decent graphics, goofy plot
B008M36EEI|4.0|The was a quirky English comedy film which was surprisingly touching. It was more about overcoming skepticism and finding hope and dedication to a difficult goal.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really did. It has some great moments, but the whole movie revolves around MT's dementia and it moves at an agonizing pace. After the first ten minutes you want to tell the director, \\"okay Maggie is getting old and her mental faculties are no longer 100% we get it, move on\\" but the movie continues to bludgeon you with it in almost every scene. Another issue I had was there were some attempts at cinematic imagery, that were unevenly applied. When combine those with the constant portrayal of MT's dementia  it was very difficult to figure out what was supposed to be historical and what was the director attempting to be \\"artful\\". Great sets, good acting, mediocre cinematography, substandard plot and metering.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|aaayhhhhh<br />aaahhhhhh<br />aaahhhh<br /><br />it is a fun file game.<br /><br />t<br />it is a fun file game that is good for all those people that like mithalagey and games because it is both
B0070XFNDE|4.0|This novel is a sequel to \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\".  Ruiz Zafon's writing is enjoyable as usual.  I love his sense of irony.  The story brings together many of the story lines mentioned in the two previous books.  However, though some loose ends were tied, it left as many questions as it answered.  Actually probably more.  I have to think that the author is writing another novel to continue the saga.  I enjoy his novels and look forward to answers to the dangling questions.
B008M34INW|4.0|It was fun to see Mel Gibson display his enormous talents which include an ability to play pathos with humor and tragedy without crushing the viewer emotionally. He exudes a rugged cuteness and of course the sort of happy ending. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B001RJJ82O|1.0|I was not interest in Spawn when this movie came out.  My son was real small and unfortunately my days were made of cartoons and god aweful family films (God help me-Free Willy!). A few months ago I started collecting McFarlane figures and found Spawn to be the most creative. My son has come to collect as well and we compete sometimes with our purchases. Anyway we decided to watch this movie together hoping to get some idea of the Spawn mythos and did we ever regret it.<br /><br />I have to start by complaining about the special effects. They are B-movie grade and that is a compliment they barely deserve.  The hell sequence was the worst and reminded me of those Sci-fi channel movies that obviously is ran through a mediocre computer program by a half-wit. The only thing we found remotely interesting was the cape, which as someone else said, was rarely seen and that made the star rating fall even further from 5.<br /><br />The next thorn in the movie is the Spawn suit.  it looked severly padded and when the lead actor walked in it I was reminded of a Godzilla suit.  I don't understand why it was needed because the actor had a nice build without it.  Also the burned face mask is as cheesy as the ones used in the later Nightmare On Elm Street movies.  It is sad when it is compared to the look of Spawn in comics and action figures.<br /><br />The clown is down right stupid and the lame sense of humor his character is supposed to have got irritating quick.  We both, taking turns, fast forwarded through his scenes and the dialog of all the actors seemed written by mindless juveniles.  Due to my son I have been around many teens through the years and they all showed a wealth of intelligence, forcing me to wonder about the mental capabilities of the screen writers when this mess was conceived.  I read one of the comics after viweing this and found that the story is very interesting, there is no excuse for this farce of cinema.  Pass this by but if you must watch, rent and make sure you don't invest much money on that.
B004F1F32A|4.0|This was actually a pretty good movie.  I am not actually a big fan of Neeson, but he does a good job in this movie.  Good action, good story and just good fun.
0316056871|5.0|This book was a breeze to read. It took me 3 days. I just could not put it down. Tina is funny and very straight-forward. Her stories are relatable and make me smile. I've read it twice already and lent it out.
B008M34INW|5.0|This movie was GREAT!  Really kept me glued to the TV for the whole movie.  Enjoyed the acting, the writing, etc.  A MUST see, for sure!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is a great game!!! very entertaining and a great time killer. beware can be very addicting once you start to play...:-)
B000KK0AKU|4.0|One of my favorites!  Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger in the 80s in NYC.....you can't go wrong.  Steamy love story!
B00846REIS|5.0|After 50 shades didn't think I'd find another interesting book with all the right excitement in it, but this book has it all and then some. Can't wait for next one.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Great book, just finished second in series, Point of Retreat. Also excellent. Was looking for something to read after I finished Fifty Shades series, and this series did not disapoint!
B008M34CSI|3.0|It's not bad.  Plot jumps around a little.  Don't expect Academy Award material.  Good special effects.  Decent ending that keeps you guessing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My son purchased this book for my tablet.  This was the first time I have ever read a book in this format.  I really enjoyed reading in this form and will be sure to get future books on my tablet.  It was fast and easy and you were able to read the first and part of the second chapters before purchasing. I was told to get with the time and I did.  Thank you.
B001G7HKZ4|5.0|I love this charming film almost as much as I love Lee Pace. Its funny, romantic, and very enjoyable. There are a few moments that will pull at your heartstrings if you've ever been in love especially if its unrequited.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great books, and the movie did a great job keeping true to the book. I am looking forward to the rest of the series. It relates great to all age groups.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I had not expected to enjoy this movie as much as I did. It was entertaining and exciting. Good movie...
B000YIWF4C|5.0|I've got a clear bias, as I am a Columbia Business School Alum who had Greenwald as a professor, but this book is good.  His other book, Globalization, is also good, but it is very academic and sometimes hard to read,even for someone with an Econ background.  Value investing, on the other hand, is very approachable.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from beginning to the end. Definitely a page turner and hard to put down. Highly recommended!!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a very well done movie. It follows the book quite well with only a few changes. The actors are great and the actual film quality is fantastic. Great product! I definitely recommend it!
B001BANK32|4.0|I wouldn't say this is a really terrifying book, but it was thoroughly enjoyable. I don't often revisit books, but I would consider reading this again, a little slower this time to really enjoy it.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Liam neeson is badass in this movie.  He does what all fathers should do if their daughter is in danger - kick some serious ass.
B002B44KDG|5.0|Just a classic Neil Young album. I had the album, I have the cd and now I have it on my player on my phone and I hope my Kindle Fire.
B000002H33|5.0|This was the final studio album that Metallica's late great bass player,Cliff Burton,played on before his death at the age of only 24.He was without question...in my opinion,THE BEST bass player that Metallica ever had.He was a part of the heart and soul of original Metallica.Unfortunatly,this talented young man left this world way too soon....As far as this album,it rocks! Pure thrash metal to the bone! It's a shame that Metallica has not kept this same sound throughout their later releases.Kill 'Em All,Ride The Lighting and Master Of Puppets will always be Metallica's best in my opinion.Five Stars.
B007704HO6|5.0|I really enjoyed reading \\"A Street Cat Named Bob\\" and highly recomend it. It is a beautiful True story about a man recovering from drug addiction, and how Bob the cat came into his life and virtually saved him. It goes to show you what an animal can do for us. Just loved this book.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I have this app on a motorola droid 2 and on an Asus Infinity tablet.  I pretty much always play music from my device, but I have tried the cloud streaming on my phone, and apart from a slight delay in starting to play the song (probably due to buffering) it works fine.  I have both downloaded music from my cloud drive and uploaded it onto both devices and both work great.  My one major complaint is that once you create a playlist or add songs to now playing, you CANNOT drag and drop the songs to change the order.  You have to delete the songs and add them again in the order you want.  I usually don't use the shuffle feature because I like to listen to songs in a particular order if they seem to go together well.<br /><br />On my phone, the ability to skip songs or pause without having to unlock the screen is pretty nice, and I will give them credit that it is innovative.<br /><br />Overall, the app has functioned fine and played music fine, but not being able to easily change the order of my songs is a huge drawback.
B007SGM084|5.0|This Trilogy is awesome, and I highly recommend it!  I could not stop reading until I finished all three books.  Details galore, oh my!  The story behind all the \\"details\\" pulls you right in.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Erotic, funny romance novel. Very well written, and causes an inability to stop turning pages. Keeps you on the edge of wanting....MORE!
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I saw Coldplay in concert for the  first time. And as soon as I got home I purchased the album. It is lively and fun and isn't all dreary like some of their older songs tend to be. A very lively album with good lyrics, catchy rhythms and an irresistible want to get up and dance and sing
B005IQZB14|4.0|It felt like Cheryl Strayed was writing about my life, what she experienced when her mom died is very close to what I have been going through.<br />Feeling disconnected with family, feeling alone and feeling like I have to find my way somehow - all very close to home.<br />I haven't hiked for months on end but in the last 6 months I've been Hang Gliding, Ziplining, in a Helicopter, and keep going back to ride the biggest, fastest roller coasters in the country.  I am looking for my peace and I hope like Cheryl I find it at the end of my journey -whenever that will be.
0756405890|2.0|I went into this with every intention of liking it but it just didn't happen for me.  Overall, the book reminds me of the Harry Potter series:  improvished boy goes to school to learn wizardry, offends a really mean professor and a poor little rich spoiled kid who does everything to make his life miserable (or worse).  I mean really, REALLY?  Couldn't you come up with something a little more original?  The story drags and drags.  I think a part of the problem is that this is a trilogy--too much material for one book but not enough for three.  I hear that not much that Kvothe wants to resolve, e.g., Chandrians, is resolved in the second volume so it looks like a bunch of side stories.  I think that I'll skip this series.  I'm also surprised by all of the  wildly enthusiastic reviews--don't you people read anything more critical than fantasy?
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Awesome documentary.  More than anything else, all of the interview footage from Bob and the Wailers was very cool to watch.  I had to watch it twice in 12 hours just to make sure I took it all in.  Solid pickup for anyone, Bob Marley fan or not!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Just like the first book of the trilogy, I find this book to be such fiction that it is unbelievable. The only reason I bought the second book is because a friend told me that it defines the first book. Not! I will not be wasting any more money on the third book. Despite the trashy content, the author's writing style is, in my opinion, very unprofessional. If I had to read \\"oh my!\\" one more time, I felt like I would throw up.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|OK for entertainment, easy summer read.  I am not sure quite why it has been on the NYT best seller list so long.  It's an interesting psychological study, but it's a little heavy on the graphics for me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had heard from my daughter about angry birds 2 years ago, but didn't want to put games on my cellphone, as I used it to keep in touch with my children and grandchildren thru texting and talking on the phone.  2 months ago, my sister told me I could get the Kindle Fire with my husbands rewards points, so I ordered it and began playing Words With Friends with her.  I asked her about the Angry Birds App and she said it only costs 99 cents, so I got that one too.  I love Angry Birds, tho it can be very frustating too.  I play it almost every day.  Kudos to the inventer!
B003YL4KS0|5.0|My curly hair looks great, I have fell in love with my natural curls! Thank you for the wonderful deals! I love amazon it's where I go for all my reviews....
B00846TTDG|3.0|The movie was ok but the story line was not well developed . The characters were not well developed either.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is very good! Interesting story!Am half way through and can't wait to see how it ends - so I can get the 2nd one!
B001O1O71C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I would definetly recommend it.  It's a very short book and an easy read.  Its very difficult for me to read about \\"The Holocaust.\\"  I always hope and pray that there are those that tried to help the Jews.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|When I first started reading his books I thought they were going to be boring, but I found out that once you  started reading I found myself right in the mix trying to figure out who the traitor is or capturing the killer right along with the good guys.
B008BM9L72|1.0|This is pure mummy porn. I have only read about half of the first book and don't think I'll bother with the rest. From my point of view a shear waste of money.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|I love all Lee Child books, esspecially the Jack Reacher ones although the way he travels without a wallet and clothes frustrates the hell out of me . I couldn't do it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have read all three books in the Hunger Games trilogy and I am OBSESSED! I couldn't WAIT for the movie to come out. I was there on opening night and I am one of the few who went into the movie not expecting too much violence. I knew since it was a PG 13 movie that it couldn't have as much violence as the books. SO, because I went in with that expectation, I LOVED the movie! The only complaint I have heard from people who have read the books is that there was not enough violence in the film. I personally thought they did a fantastic job with the movie. I still like the book better, but it's rare that I love a movie more than a book. I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to EVERYONE!
B008602KQI|4.0|I never read the book because I had heard it was very bloody and graphic but decided to give the movie a chance and I liked it!  I thought the girl in the lead part was very good and, although it was a little hokey in the sci-fi<br />parts, it kept your interest.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoy the movie The Hunger Games, and the video quality of the BluRay is great.  We sat and watched all of the behind the scenes footage, which is really interesting.  They provide a lot of background for this movie.
B00285K1KE|4.0|By far the best Hulk adaptation on the big screen. I understand why Ed Norton's version got more love from the general public, but Bana's Banner/Hulk dynamic was much closer to the true spirit of the comic.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Video was quality - got a little slow sometimes but most likely that was my internet. This season was great!
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Excellence book. Simple, easy to understand for everyone. It change my perception and shift up to new level.<br />Highly recommend for everyone
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Having been one of the people that was turned on to the series via the T.V programme, a storm of swords was the first time I was reading ahead of where the series had finnished. To put it bluntly, it in no way lets you down if you are a fan of the T.V series or the books.<br />George R.R Martin has created a realm so diverse and with some of the greatest writting I have ever read. The characters pull you into their world and their hardships and you find yourself completely engrossed, it is here were Martins true genius is reflected. He gives them such human emotions of all different degrees and shows the sicology behind each person.<br />In short, I have already started A Feast For Crows and basicaly everything else in my life is just a distraction untill I can get back to my book.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is awesome,heart breaking, and action packed. I loved it,my heart went out to all those children. Katniss is the next superwoman.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought I.didn't want anything to do with sex since menopause struck.  Now I know its lousy lovers I don't want. Bring it!
B00846REIS|3.0|Much too similar to Ana and Christian.<br />Down to the rich business man persona. Should not be read after reading fifty shades of grey .
0061692042|2.0|I read glowing critical reviews of this book and I was excited to read it but my excitement proved to be insufficient to sustain me as I tried to slog my way through it. The book was at least twice as long as necessary and all of the interesting parts of the book occur in the first half. Although it was tedious reading at times, I found the first half enjoyable due mostly to the depiction of the parents. I felt empathetic to their plight and even though their problems were self inflicted, I still found the father to be likable. I knew that his plan wouldn't end well but I was sad about the outcome, nonetheless. While the mother's character was presented in a way that made her seem cold and isolated by choice, even she was more appealing than the majority of the other characters in the book.<br /><br />The author is clearly gifted and despite the monotony of his descriptions of the Canadian landscape (and every other landscape in the book) I recognized his talent but it was not enough to save the boring storyline he crafted. What should have been an exciting turn of events was instead more of a \\"thank God something happened!\\" moment. I don't want to spoil anything for others who are considering reading it but the \\"event\\" is buried so far into the book, I no longer cared what happened to any of the characters. Maybe I am just an unsophisticated reader who is unable to appreciate this new \\"classic\\" but I have a hard time sticking with a novel with no real redeeming or interesting characters. This one could have used a lot more editing and if it were about half the length, it might have been tolerable.
B008602KQI|4.0|We'll call it \\"Hunger Games for Dummies\\".  This movie followed the story of the book, but as with most books to movies, a lot was left out of the movie. Howeer, the premise is there, the important characters are there and all in all, this movie wasn't bad.  Not as good as the book, but it is worth watching.[[ASIN:B0084IG8TM The Hunger Games [2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
B007HNFREW|5.0|I'm really sort of frustrated.  All of my friends have hyped this stupid show up to the point where I figured watching it would be unbelievably disappointing.  It isn't.  It's well-written, well-acted, and basically everything fantasy shows wish they would be when they grow up.  Even the children are excellent actors.  This show contains everything good and nothing bad.<br /><br />Which means I'm addicted.<br /><br />I have no time or money to spend on new shows.  But if I don't find out what happens to Brandon, I'm going to explode.<br /><br />Also, what the hell.  Tyrion, played by Peter Dinklage, is unbelievably awesome.  It's like everything awesome that needs to happen, Tyrion hops on that and does it.  I have had heightism all of my life towards shorter men, but that is GONE.  Good god.<br /><br />Quit reading this and go watch this show.  It is carved out of pure awesome.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is just as much fun as I thought it would be.  I really didn't expect that my grand-kids would enjoy it as much as I do! Now we all grab for the kindle fire to try and get it first!  Plays great on the kindle fire.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I have to say our 12 year old wanted to rent this as we had missed seeing it in the theaters. It took about 15 minutes of the movie to figure out what was happening...but once we figured it out --- HANDS down a GREAT movie.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I think this is a must own album. The movie to me was mediocre in their attempt to tap some \\"spiritual\\" themes but this music score is absolutely incredible.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was so dissappointed with this book-  had heard so much hype about it and I thought it was xxx rated. OMG- I really don't like funky, nasty books.
B005AQT9HO|5.0|As an avid fan of classic rock, I've been on the hunt for newer bands with an older sound and feel to them. I finally found it with Rival Sons. Great lyrics, great music. A nice mix of the harder rock and a few softer songs. I will definitely be checking out their other albums.
B0056BMK6K|3.0|This ebook has great content but somewhat confusing as to how the author accomplished his great marketing results. A very specific step by step methodology would have been better. But I liked the inspiration!!
B002SHD9E2|4.0|While the singing in this movie version isn't as good as the CD of the broadway version, this movie does a great job of capturing the conflicting emotions of the main characters in a way you can't see from a seat in front of a stage.
B008602KQI|5.0|I enjoyed the movie.  All the characters fit their roles well.  The story was interesting and kept me engaged.  The movie flowed.  I was never bored.  Looking forward to the next installment in the series.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I didn't see this in the theatres, because I didn't think it sounded all that great.  However, friends recommended it, so I finally watched it.  It was a great surprise with several twists, and it was actually grounded in reality.  People *do* get hurt trying this stuff.<br /><br />I laughed more than I thought I would, and I thoroughly enjoyed the action.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|We did not read the book, so I cannot compare it with that.  We did really enjoy the movie, although I found the \\"critters\\" that they used at the end in the climax to be a bit cheesy.  I have been told that if they had attempted to use them as written in the book it would have been even more cheesy, so I'm glad they changed it.  I have definitely recommended it to friends as a really interesting story idea that was well-acted and fun to watch.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Really enjoyed being able to download right on my TV. Amazon made this very easy for us with a last minute choice to watch.<br />Will utilize service again!
B0083GQKQG|2.0|This is one of those movies that seemed to me to have been made only to give actors a chance to act.  Yes, the performances were great, but I watch movies to be entertained (or made to exercise my brain) by a story, not to marvel at the performances.  There was little plot to this movie, and what there was of it was deeply disturbing without any redeeming resolution or moral to the story.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was a fitting end to the trilogy.  Excellent plot and story line. It is a shame it was his last book
B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved this book!  It has lots of twists and turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Very captivating story line!
B001NLKT60|5.0|the three book series is outstanding<br />book 1 the girl with the dragon tatoo was a little slow in developing the characters but excellent<br />This book was a rapid and exciting read
B008602KQI|5.0|Unless you live under a rock, you've probably heard of the Hunger Games book series and this movie treatment of the first book.  Both the book and the movie are worth your attention because they provide different perspective views of the same material.  The book is very light on dialog, and events are mostly disclosed through the thought processes of the sixteen year old protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. The movie describes a broader perspective, and provides a larger worldview than the first book provides.  In this respect, the two versions of this story are both necessary, since the motivations of the character are clearly visible in the book, while the reality-television, game-show, decadence, and despotism aspects of the ruling class are more easily seen in the movie.  So my recommendation would be to read the first book of the series, and then see the movie afterward. Due to time (and I'm sure budget) limitations the movie doesn't include many of the details that were clearly visible in the book, but the omission of those details doesn't detract from the overall story. The movie is well produced, and while it compresses weeks of story into a few frantic days, it does justice to the source material. The movie is also considerably less violent than the book, but any story that describes gladatorial games used for reality television entertainment must contain the violence necessary to convince the reader that this is unjust.  The movie is a well balanced presentation, and is suitable for kids who are old enough to not be frightened by the premise. (The grim premise being twenty-four children battling to the death in an arena until only one survives, for the purposes of entertainment of the ruling class and intimidation of the general population.)
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I titled this somewhat forgettable because, well, apparently I read this book once before and forgot!  I was all excited to read this, having heard the hype.  I waited on the library hold list, finally got it in and started right away.  Within a few chapters I was thinking that maybe I had read an excerpt somewhere because parts sounded so familiar.  By the time I got halfway through I was getting suspicious, and the end, with it's twist?  Well, I knew what was going to happen long before it occurred.  Apparently I read this book a while back and didn't remember it at all, which isn't a good sign. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book with a good amount of suspense and some pretty well-developed characters, just not ones that will stay with me very long. Obviously. I'm looking forward to reading Ms. Flynn's next novel (I'm 99% positive I have NOT read that one) and hopefully it's less forgettable.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO INTERESTING AND FUN I CAN'T SEEM TO WANT TO PUT IT DOWN I FIND MYSELF NOT WANTING TO GO TO MY EMAILS I JUST OPEN THE GAME
B00571F26Y|3.0|Found this very interesting and believable.  Feel it does account for alot of the weight troubles we have expecially the bloating.<br />Well worth a read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME BIBLE FOR THOSE WHO READ THE LORDS WORD, THANK GOD FOR THE AUDIO PART  THE BIBLE.
B0049VZ222|5.0|It didn't seem like sucha  great series in the first episode or two, once it really got rollingf it became suspenseful. Sure there were a few scenes or episodes that stood out, but what I enjoyed was the survivalist modes put into place.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|At sixty five years of age, I can safely say that I liked these books a great deal.  The escapades of sexual divergence had not as much hold on my psyche as much as the truth regarding what love, and dedication is about. At every turn my mind was worried that something untoward was going to be the result of last nights, (or days) intimate encounters. It took the middle of the second book to realize my fears were unfounded.<br />What a fun read, and the thought of leaving the characters behind and go on to other works left me a bit sad.<br />The final verdict is...  Three books, are not enough.  Bring on the mink handcuffs!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A book which I am reading slowly ( as I usually do) because I don't want it to end too quickly. I love Victoria (the main character) and the woman Elizabeth who introduced her to the language and labeling of the different flowers.
B006QPVH6O|4.0|The overall idea of the film was a good one. I thought the acting was fair. If they would have had a blockbuster budget it would have been a blockbuster film.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|This movie was the tops.Kept me on the edge of my seat.Really wanted to own it and now I do.
0525478817|5.0|John Green is honestly the most brilliant writer. I started this book 3 days ago, and i have about 60 pages yet. I know that it's not a proper review until I've finished the book, but I have laughed and cried, both hysterically. I may be an emotional teenage female in a serious relationship, but this book has had a definite impact on the way I think. I commend John Green on his piece of awesomness.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I love Sheldon. He's hilarious. I bought all five seasons. I watch it over and over again and it's still funny
B000IBVRQW|4.0|This was a good movie about Jane Grey's life, but it didn't go far enough for me.  They didn't stress enough on how Northumberland was scheming to rule England through his son and Jane--it was more than just religion that made him a traitor.  And of course, the love between Jane and Guilford Dudley never existed.  But they gave us enough to show that the families used Jane for their own ambitions.  And Helena Bonham-Carter--it was nice to see her so young--I didn't know her career started at a younger age.  Overall, I think anyone who wants to see it will enjoy it.
B002PNDEXK|4.0|After reading the book \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", I wanted to see the movie, directed by Ang Lee, again.  I had seen it in the theaters when it first came out and liked it, but I was not as familiar with this story, having never read the book.  My first Jane Austen book was \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and after that, I could not make myself read any of her others thinking NOTHING could top P & P.  So years went by before I read \\"S & S\\".  After reading the book, I thought \\"I have to see that movie again\\"!  I knew the story would be so much more meaningful after having read the book, and I was right.  The movie is so wonderful--the details they got so right in the clothes, houses and furnishings, the actors who played the parts, the way it was written (thank you Emma!)--all are excellent.  This is such a lovely rendition of a spectacular book.  Movies rarely live up to the books they are taken from byt this one did.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Excellent for mystery & suspense.  Had some trouble connecting names and people as the author uses Swedish names, so it was somewhat confusing at times.  Some sections really slow, but the areas that stepped up the action makes you forget the rest.  I highly recommend this book as well as the other 2 books in the trilogy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Maybe it is just me, but in a good read, there should be a moral lesson: the villain should be brought to justice. I just don't like stories that end up validating someone totally reprehesible, or, in this case 2. Sorry, just not my cup of tea!
B008XFAT7S|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie it reminds me of Ong Bak but very well choreographed and gruesome (in a good way) I'd like to see more of this type film
B008602KQI|2.0|After reading the Hunger Games trilogy, I pre-ordered the movie and could hardly wait until it was released and I received it. I popped it into the BlueRay as soon as I found it in my mailbox. The actors who play Katniss and Peeta were excellent and I loved seeing Woody Harrleson.  However, I thought the remaining acting was \\"cheesy\\" as were all of the special effects. After reading the book first and then seeing the move, I have no idea how anyone who didn't read the book had a clue what was going on in the movie. I was SO disappointed that I'm not sure I'll even bother seeing the remaining two movies yet to come. There was no background given on the story, no explanation of what the hunger games were and how children were entered into the drawing, and the games appeared to last only a day or two. The story was so rushed and jumped from one scene to another. There didn't appear to be any relationships formed between Katniss and Peeta, or between them and Haymitch, or between Katniss and Cinna. Nor was there any explanation of who Gale was or the history between Gale and Katniss, or who Haymitch was. I understand that it's impossible to cover everything that was in the book, but I expected more. The scene I was most anxious to see in the movie was when Katniss and Peeta rode out on their chariot with flames on their outfits. The effects looked so fake I couldn't believe it. I re-watched the movie a second time to give it another chance, but unfortunately I still feel the same.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The best book i´ve read in a while. I´m pretty glad i bought this bundle. It´s even better than de HBO series.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|This book has it all...suspense, love triangle and found myself laughing through the chapters. So far, best Stephanie Plum book.
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and was glad when I bought it on Blue Ray, It is simply a great flick to watch and watching it on Hi-Definition is simply great.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The concept of this novel was intense and gratifying. However, It fell short of what it could have been.  The ending was lacking creativity.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a most anticipated movie and I could not wait to see it. I must say that it didi not disappoint. I enjoyed the movie very much. It had the action and a plot, which to me is always important in a movie. I would reccomend adding this movie to your collection, because you would enjoy it now and later.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this trilogy,  the movie is worth your while.  It might even make you think.  I look forward to the next one.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book, exciting and fast paced with just enough intriguing historical facts to keep it real.Im almost done the entire series.<br />[[ASIN:0062017926 The Judas Strain: A Sigma Force Novel]]
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I like this game, but its not something I'm addicted too. It's a decent if you want to keep occupied for a few minutes.
B008602KQI|5.0|Afeter reading the book, I was looking forward to the movie.  I do not go to the theaters and upon receiving the DVD, I was pleased with DVD.  Great production.  Looking forward to the next movie/DVD.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|Restkess is not a new book and I don't know how I missed it!! It is truly exciting and full of unexpected twist and turns it. It spends equal time during WW2 and thirty years layer as a mother gradually reveals to her daughter her secret life as spy who has had to take on a new identity to avoid being killed by a traitor living in luxury and a perceived war hero which is far from the truth!!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This is a very good adventure movie. I gave it four stars because the tempo the movie kept. Events either occurred too quickly or too slowly. Other than that the actors were amazing in the roles and the director did great in representing the book.<br /><br />If you didn't read the book you may be slightly lost on some of the movie. It watch it twice an you should get a good feel for it.<br /><br />This is a movie you must see.
030758836X|5.0|Okay, I hate book reviews with even a hint of a spoiler, or a whisper about what will happen in the story. Unfortunately, I read some reviews of GONE GIRL by Gillian Flynn that clued me into some of the plot mysteries. I won't do that.<br /><br />Let me first say this is a wonderful novel filled with plot complexity and wonderful characterizations of Nick and and Amy, husband and wife.<br /><br />The story unfolds with Amy gone, just disappeared like a vapor into thin air. The narrators are Amy and Nick. The first part of the novel as told through Nick's and Amy's eyes has alternating chapters told by each of them.<br /><br />In a sort of reverse sequencing, Amy's chapters focus on the past, when she and Nick met and describe the onset of the problems that beset their seemingly perfect marriage. Nick's chapters, on the other hand, begin on the day of Amy's disappearance and progress day by day as this nightmare unfolds.<br /><br />Slowly and inexorably, Amy's story melds with Nick's as their respective chapters move closer in time.<br /><br />Eventually, we get to part 2 describing what happens when the police get involved and slowly, the puzzle of Amy's disappearance begins to be solved. But that's only the beginning of the story.<br /><br />I won't tell you any more than that. I'll simply say the story is a chilling tale of duplicity and devilish manipulation. As a reader, you can't help but turn the pages to find out where it all ends up.<br /><br />Five out of five stars for a cleverly constructed tale and for hip, stylized storytelling. This is wonderful, contemporary fiction.<br /><br />Mark Rubinstein, Author, MAD DOG HOUSE (Thunder Lake Press, October 23, 2012)
B008602KQI|5.0|the movie is very entertaining good story line and action  looking forward for more from this series and i think you need to watch it a few times to realize how good every part of the movie is good
B008A1NSTG|3.0|It was neat to think that it is based on a real life event. Good for the whole family. The scenery was beautiful. A little sad for small children but that is part of life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I first read \\"The Hunger Games.\\" I'm 63 years old and I have not yet seen the movie and wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Well I could not put down the book and continued to read \\"Catching Fire\\" and then \\"Mockingjay\\" with the same enthusiasm.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love this show. And the instant streaming was great. No stopping or buffering at all....would rather have had the option to rent the season instead but for the price it was worth it for whole season.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|One of the funniest movies ever made. I watch this movie when I'm bored and trust me.. it totally makes my day! The movie has all sorts of comedy, including slap stick, dark and sarcastic. Plus there's just amazing character development, which for a big-budget Hollywood comedy is rare!
B0014EU5XI|5.0|Need great music for a long drive?  This will perk up you day and get you rolling!  Classic ZZ Top, great for waking you up and moving you forward.
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading the Fifty Shades Triology needed something new to read. A friend suggested it and I fell in love with this book too. I can't wait for the 2nd book in October.
B008602KQI|5.0|My daughter and I loved this book and were so excited to see it in the theater. It did not disappoint! I am thrilled to have my DVD, although it loses a little of the spectacle watching it on the small screen. It is a thoughtful and poignant movie that is also full of action and a romance. Hard to imagine better. Enjoy!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|cannot remember ever reading a more poorly written book in my life.  It seemed like a book written and edited by a nine year old with knowledge of sex.  Hated it beyond words.
B005P1YCNK|4.0|I really appreciated the simplicity and truth of this book.  No hype or quick fix methods, just truth that anyone can incorporate into their daily lives.  This a great reminder to help reinforce and be consistent with these principles if you already practice them and a great starting place if these principles are new to you. The author's style of writing is easy to follow and the examples given in the book are very realistic and relatable.
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the books and loved them. Saw this movie, and was very pleased. It stuck close to the original plot. I would highly recommend viewing this. It's definitely a younger adult movie, but it still will keep the older viewer engaged as well. Can't wait for the next one to come out!
B0058BIDUK|5.0|Big fan - though a late adopter :) - it has to be one of the best shows on t.v. What's not to like...
B0084IG8TM|2.0|This movie is simply way over rated. The over hyping of the movie itself already misleads people. It gives people a pretty high expectation for the movie, so if's the movie is okay, we'll feel that it's a bad one (worse than okay). If the movie is bad, we'll feel it's really bad one.<br /><br />And here are the reasons of why this movie itself (without any consideration of its overhyping around it):<br /><br />Spoilers below<br /><br />1. People say that Katniss issuch a great character with all her heart, mentality, and skills. The \\"heart\\" part, I agree. The \\"mentality\\" and \\"skills\\" part, I don't agree at all. Both her mentality and skills are not consistent, in this movie at least (I never read the book, that's why I'm reviewing the movie only ;p)<br /><br />Examples: I don't think replacing her younger sister is a super noble move at all, that's what a big sister or brother do anyway, except the older sibling feel that they can't win at all or doesn't care at allor worse, both. Okay, let's say it's a noble/bold move, then what? With the Hunger Games already going on year after year, they are suppossed to be prepared mentally and strategy wise! She hasn't prepared anything for the games except her hunting skills?? No strategy, no other kind of martial art or self defense at all? That's not consitent and doesn't make sense.<br /><br />She also get a lot of help: from the mentor when he sent the cream in her hiding to heal her open wound, Peeta's help when he persuaded the \\"bad group\\" to leave her and let her tired while he gave her chance to escape and plan soemething better, and also the little girl who's smart and idolize her, she also helped our so called great main character. So she's not that good actually. Even with all those helps, she barely made it.<br /><br />And how come his mentor can send in help like that? If the hunger game president really doesn' twnat to give the poor (district 12) too much hope, then he'll hold Katniss' mentor to be responsible for some kind of punishment, since it's not fair, especially against the president's will (we can see how he wants to control the outcome of the game).<br /><br />2. The fighting scenes is so annoying!! The camera work are worse than if a 5 year old holding a video camera and trying to film an MMA match! It keeps shaking so bad and going everywhere! And I am not exaggerating at all, it is that bad!!<br /><br />3. The movie is way too slow and too long. Recently, this become a trend for a so called big and great movie (I called them overhyped), examples of other movies which are way too slow and long (both great or bad movies): Transformers series, The dark Knight Rises, Battleship, etc. Why come back to the old school wy of presenting movies? Remember when we watch old James Bond series still played by great Sean Connery, awesome Roger Moore? They are great James Bond movies, just way too slow and long (4 minute on underwater diving scene, etc.). The James Bond movies played by Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig are pretty way faster pace.<br /><br />On top of all that, it's way overhyped, then it'll mislead people to have a very high expectation, so I was about to rate this movie 1 star but again, after I cool down from the overhyped, I just review the movie itself without the overhyping, I give it 2 stars.<br /><br />Ooh, one more. Why do they have to use children to figth to the death? Just use adult to fight to the death? That idea also makes me sick, seeing what they intended to be 12-16 year old killing each other (this question is more for the author of teh book, Suzanne Collins ;p)<br /><br />Anyway, the movie itself is okay. But with the idea and teh overhyping, it's getting worse. Just be prepared.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Entertaining book, I picked this up from a recommendation on Amazon and enjoyed it. You can definitely see the paralells to Haldeman and Heinlein, but this book stand on it's own and doesn't feel forced. I'm anxiously awaiting the next book which is being released in a few weeks.
B008M34CSI|2.0|Poor directing, poor acting and predictable story line. The computer graphics were the only thing \\"good\\" about this movie and even that was just...okay.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Catches your attention early, then maintains it throughout.  Great twists.  Could not put it down once halfway through.  Good incentive to read other G Flynn novels.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I've read no less than 10 books on Navy SEALs and this book is the best.  This book isn't like others with pages of details describing battles with the enemy.  Fearless focuses on the man, and as a result we're able to better understand the type of people this line of work attracts.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|The CD version was always in our car for road trips. Our family knows all the words and sings along. Now it is with me always!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Well, since I absolutely love this movie, there is no surprise on my rating here.  The acting, directing, writing, cinematography, everything.  This is a fantastic.  Easily in my Top 5 Movies list.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I enjoy the ancient mythical Greek era so I enjoyed this film. It's not an academy award movie for sure but it's still entertaining
B002E66C6E|4.0|The U-Boat with the Enigma was captured by the British, not the Americans.  Bletchley Park was the site that broke the Enigma code; it was in the UK not the US.  That said, the movie was still a good one with good acting and believable characters; I enjoyed it.  Especially the dedication, where the film makers paid homage to the crews that captured Enigmas from the Nazis.  Without their sacrifices England might have fallen; what a scary thought!
B008M34CSI|2.0|Don't remember much of the movie as we were drinking heavily while watching it on the deck. You had to suspend reality right up front as the President's daughter would have been brutalized immediately in a prison take over situation, space station or not.  Kind of labored after that.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great love story! Easy to read and you can put it down 1 second. It's a must read and its so much better then the movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|The books, of course, go into so much needed detail about this story. However, being as the movie can only be just so long I think it was done well. I am glad it wasn't as gory as the books..made it easier to see. The actors were cast perfectly & they all did an excellent job. This is a \\"must see\\" movie. Buy the dvd, you'll want to see it several times!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|as good as TWC on TV and I don't have to listen to a lot of junk to get the forecast
B008602KQI|5.0|I took my daughter, who has read ALL the books, to see The Hunger Games in the theater.  Both of us loved the film and couldn't wait to have a copy for our library.
B005IQZB14|5.0|As a hiker who has gone through days of blistered painful feet, carried heavy packs, put in long hours (23 miles in one day coming out of the Wind Rivers), having lost a loved one to cancer, and having met someone in the Cascades who was hiking the PCT from Mexico and noticed his odor, I lived some parts of this book.  However, it wasn't so much that I could related to the author's experiences, it was quality of writing with which she related her story that kept me on the trail with her.  Blending her life story with her trail story always kept me wanting to know \\"what happens next\\".  So well written that I could feel her pain and her joy. I can't say that I full understand why her mother's death made her so self destructive, though I recognize that the two journey's, hiking the PCT and writing this book were ultimately cathartic, bring both the author and the reader to where she is today.  I can highly recommend Wild by Cheryl Strayed for both my hiking and non-hiking friends.
B008602KQI|5.0|My granddaughter has been a Hunger Games fanatic forever.  She  has seen this movie several times, and was so happy when it arrived.  Now she can watch it anytime, anywhere.
B008602KQI|5.0|great movie, just a glimice of what could happen when the goverment takes over,beware!!! hopefully there will be more movies like the. wake up america
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Pretty good movie. Good video quality from Amazon as allways.I liked the Japanese film \\"Battle Royale\\" better though, both movies had a similar theme.
B005NFVZZG|5.0|A great third season to a terrific series. Full of lover's quarrels, dangerous resurrections, and plot twists that will keep even the most devoted fans guessing, I highly recommend this season and series. My favorite part, an ending you can't imagine that has me hovering over my computer, ripping out my hair in frustration that I have to wait for the next season.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in 1 day and the whole series in four.  I thought that this was a wonderful read.  There were only a handful of typos in the entire series that I noticed.  There are some repetitive adjectives, but they carry with the character's personality and honestly how many different words can you use to describe a vagina?<br /><br />Worth the read!!
B002VUFKG6|2.0|While Gilbert retains some of the charming voice that shone through in Eat Pray Love, the structure (or lack thereof) of Committed kills the book.  The transitions between her experiences on this journey with Felipe and forays into the sociology and history of marriage were awkward.  Gilbert's conversational tone faltered when she went to deep into the academic research on marriage, and she never came across as an \\"expert\\".  The most annoying thing about the book was her constant ambivalence about marriage and then her inevitable conclusion that it was an institution she could and would embrace wholeheartedly.  The book could have benefited enormously from an editor willing to re-structure the book and cut huge awful chunks and add in more.  Reading the book left me hungry to read a better-written, better-researched tome on the same topic.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this book in 1 day and the whole series in four.  I thought that this was a wonderful read.  There were only a handful of typos in the entire series that I noticed.  There are some repetitive adjectives, but they carry with the character's personality and honestly how many different words can you use to describe a vagina?<br /><br />Worth the read!!
B00821PCJS|4.0|I am into this type of sci fi on tv. Of course this is good but not excellent in my opinion.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read this book in 2 days and the whole series in four.  I thought that this was a wonderful read.  There were only a handful of typos in the entire series that I noticed.  There are some repetitive adjectives, but they carry with the character's personality and honestly how many different words can you use to describe a vagina?<br /><br />Worth the read!!
B004Q9TK98|5.0|From the first page I could not put this book down absolutely mind blowing! Fantastic author will never be dissapointed in any of her books
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was in suspense the entire book. Each time I thought I knew where it was going, I was wrong and caught surprised. It was hard to know whether to sympathize with the main character or be glad that he was being treated this way. The ending was unexpected and I have continually pondered it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think every one should get this app it is AMAZING EVERYONE GET IT. get it now. finally they came out with this
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I enjoyed the first book and wondered what was next so got the next two books.  I have talked to several people who have read this series and have enjoyed it.  Not being used to the proper terms and names I had to refer back a few times to remember who was who.<br /><br />Over all a great series.
B008BM9L72|4.0|I enjoy romances and decided to explore the hullaballoo over the alleged mommy porn (but I'll leave my view on society's dictates on indulgences for mommy's for later) and purchased this trilogy to adorn my Kindle (at about 100ZAR less than my bookstore was offering).<br />Let's call this what it is - an intimate romance. The BDSM is an entertaining divergance from the real story, which contains poorly written prose with haphazardly inserted adjectives swapped for go-look-it-up-in-the-dictionary synonyms to describe the character's emotions and expressions. EL James clearly has a lot of time on her hands, but I couldn't help but fall in love with Grey. He is an obsessively protective, intimate, handsome billionare -characteristics that the ladies sitting in the bell curve of a normal distibution appreciate. The character development is a bit suspect - it isn't clear why he transforms so quickly and the internal thoughts of Ana Steele on paper, are not believable - this is a well-read intelligent writer in the making and her prose is poor. I did skip through some of the sex scenes though as again, I think the writer included them as an interesting diversion. The trouble with the books, is that I can picture many women comparing Grey with their own men - it is so far fetched that it becomes fantasy. In some respects, this may disappoint the reader as they realise this guy just does not exist! I also felt the book could have worked well if there were just two(again, fault of the sex scenes). Having said that, I'd still recommend it to my romantic friends; I could not put it down; but one should read it with an open mind and see it for what it is - a celebration of an intimate relationship, which is what we are all programmed to appreciate.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Doesn't move fast enough.  Disappointing finish. Not up to Grisham standards in my opinion. I loved his earlier novels, especially \\"A time to kill\\".
B006RUJST6|4.0|Big up to Hoover - this and the follow up - Point of Retreat, are intelligently written captivating romances. The prose and character development were superb. The story was at times unbelievable, but the down to earth characters and setting kept me entertained. A truly intriguing protaganist in Lake. If you enjoy unexpected stories about truly normal people, this is for you. Circumstance and tragedy brings the main characters together and forms the basis of their relationship. While the story unfolds though, they realise their similarities and potential longevity go beyond the experiences that brought them together. I would love to read more of Hoover's offerings.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all 3 of these books in 4 days, I could not put them down. I never read love stories,I'm a mystery murder lover but this was definitely one book that will read again and again!
B001GS5BI6|5.0|very happy with this shipment and product, xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx ...
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Not very engaging.  The interface was boring.  The response time lagged, I couldn't move very quickly.  I would not buy this again.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is excellent.  Very romantic and a great read for any woman. If you like the Shades of Gray series you will like this book. Can't wait for the 2nd book in October.
B007SGM084|5.0|Just what we women needed. I hope to read more from this author. Hopefully with the same playfulness. This book left me speechless and at time breathless......
B008602KQI|5.0|When I ordered the DVD, I did not have a Blu-Ray player.  When it arrived I did.  It looked good, but a do-over would be the Blu-ray discs.
B008OM0M4U|5.0|I bought this off of Amazon Prime as a download and it was a good laugh.  I recommend watching it!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I had to finish the trilogy to see what all the fuss was about. I still don't see it. The writing style is that of an 11th grader; the plot is thin; the characters are poorly drawn. The sex was repetitive and unrealistic. Nothing new or exciting in this trilogy.
B00701L5XS|4.0|I use this app to help teach Boy Scouts about knots.  They love the video-game-like format, and it helps illustrate complicated knots to them.  It's certainly a niche app, since most people probably don't know, or use, any other knot except tying their shoes.  That said, it does a good job, and illustrates how to tie a variety of useful knots.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read the fifty shades trilogy and want more, so a friend told me about \\"Bared to you\\" and at the end I wanted more. I have already pre ordered the next book. Great read!!!!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is a great time-passer.  Shooting the birds into the concocted structures is mindlessly fun, and each new level poses a variety of challenges and puzzles.  Almost everyone enjoys this game.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I often get part way through non-fiction books and never complete them.  This one had me engaged from start to finish and even looking for more at the end.  Some very enlightening ideas here on why we do what we do - or don't do what we would like to do.  There is some direction at the end around how to apply this to your own life, but the actual application is likely to be more work, more difficult - but potentially very rewarding if followed through.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|I can never remember which bills are due on exactly which days - but this simple app helps.  It's a convenient, single place to put this important information, and it reminds you.  It's helpful, and I recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book and it kept me turning pages and guessing until the very end!  I woke up in the morning anxious to start reading because I couldn't WAIT to see what happened.  This is the first time in my life that I have actually spent a day doing nothing but reading!!  I couldn't WAIT to see what happened next!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Into The Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes is an absolutly entertaining read. When I first read by sample it was slightly confusing to follow. Yet by the end of my sample Haynes reeled me in! This book deals with heavy mental issues and keeps you wanting to read more and more to see how the Cathy got to such a place. Haynes style of writing is very clever and entertaining! I recommend this book of suspense with many, many twists and turns! I could hardly put it down!
B008602KQI|5.0|If you read the books, you should still like this.  If you see this first, you will probably want to go read the books.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark Places was the second novel I read by Gillian Flynn. Although I enjoyed Gone Girl very, very much and highly recommended it, Dark Places was even more of a page turner. Flynn has a particular style of writing that captivates her readers. If you do not like intense imagery or or very dark material stay away. Books that you cannot put down in our busy lives are hard to come by, but Gillian Flynn did it for me, twice in a row!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I love the beat to this song !! listen to it at work all the time and when I am at the gym, one of those songs that get stuck in your head
B0080CLN7Y|2.0|It takes a long time for the video to load and then once it does the video quality is not good. I would have bought hd but that video never loaded. Netflix and hulu have you download video playing software when you sign up with them to help you watch things. Maybe that is an idea you could think about. My videos on those site load fine typically and have a great picture while watching. I really like being able to have this option to buy them on your site but just wish I was receiving a better product. But overall I love Amazon!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After the final chapter of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", you just have to know what comes next. And this book is trully great!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|After reading 50 Shades of Grey it is exciting to comtimue the story. Can't wait to see what happens in the end
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm a big fan of happy endings, so I really loved the third book. As the first two, I just couldn't stop reading!!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|This was an outstanding value ,couldn't find it in my town and found it used on amazon, like new it plays great and so I recomend several of the used dvd's I've bought from amazon, on the new ones watch for the format as several are not playable on equiptment bought in the U.S.
B001HC8516|1.0|Centuries of romances have been lived and written about in books full of passion.<br />Than we have Cinderella. This book would let women believe that \\"cinderella's way\\" is the only right one for happyness (...let alone being it realistic). I don't think life, romance and relashionship is so straight, simple and...boring. Please women go for some more challenging book.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|What's not to like about this classic film?<br />Sure it doesn't have today's effects, but it does have great stars!<br />A must for every video library!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is great,goes into easy to read information of all things related to wheat addiction.I was amazed at the detail of what wheat can do to the body.if you want a book that will explain what your body goes through when consuming wheat and what it does to your blood sugar and health this is the book.Great great book and I will be putting it into action shortly!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This film was a great adaption from the book. It is hard to make a film from a book that relies on so much inner monologue, but Gary Ross did a fantastic Job. I can't wait for the rest of the trilogy.
B008M34CSI|4.0|The story line was similar to Escape From New York and Escape FROM LA, just a bit updated.  Overall, this is an entertaining \\"folly of man\\" story with plenty of action.  Worth watching, just don't take it too seriously.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game was simple and not very challenging for me. I enjoy it very much for a change of pace. Makes your brain think. Grand daughter also plays it and has no problems. She is 7 yrs old.
B002RI9K5Y|4.0|I started reading East of Eden as part of an intention to read modern classics and was overwhelmed by Steinbeck's love of words.  The story has been told several times before and since this book, but Steinbeck's narrative immerses you in the lives of the characters.<br />Do not read this if you like sparse prose in the style of Hemmingway or Toibin, rather if you enjoy Pat Conroy or John Irving.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This novel had me hooked right from the beginning. This easy read is interesting and has a great story. I felt the loss from the characters and was very interested in the flower messages. I am not sure if they are true... I found the dictionary in the back a nice resource just in case.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Obsessed with this book! Really needs to be a movie, no matter how risqué it is. This book is amazing! 5 stars!!!
B0031TZ9KS|4.0|I had little idea that the title character of this book had Asperger's Syndrome before I picked it out to read. Not only is it an interesting, intriguing story, it details the day-to-day challenges that children with Asperger's -- and their parents -- live with.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|It was nice and easy relaxing I have not used it a lot but that is only because I fall asleep on my own
B0012FE4BS|5.0|As a fan of ZZ Top from the beginning (1971) it's great to hear this recording without the \\"improvements\\" whoever thought it needed finally taken out! (example: the  two drum breaks on La Grange, HUGE difference.  The Remastered Fandango is also a big improvement
B003QP4NPE|4.0|Good book, enjoyed the read.  Though the technology involved is based on \\"current technology,\\" it still got just a little to \\"science fiction\\" unrealistic for me, but still very good and well written.  Would recommend it.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|Ingenious. Very funny too. Great acting from everyone in it. Anything Kubrick is great in my book; even his earlier work like killers kiss showed promise, regardless of the flaws. If you love Kubrick don't miss out on this masterpiece.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Shriver writing was of the utmost quality.  The story was mezmorizing and at the same time disturbing.  To think of a child born who was basically evil from the start, is perplexing.  I loved this book & highly recommended it to many people.  It would be a great \\"discussion group\\" read.
B004MPESSY|5.0|Went on a hunt to find this movie, I saw it back when it was released and LOVED the original. My boyfriend has never seen it though and I wanted him to. I found it on here and immediately called a movie night lol We sat and ate popcorn as we watched and found it very difficult to eat anything at all when it all began. Watching her get raped while stuffing our faces just seemed a little weird. Anyways...he was disgusted and was screaming at the screen for her to fight back and calling the guys every name in the book. Then he laughed as she started getting her revenge later on. If I didn't know better I would have thought we were watching a comedy from all the laughing he was doing. He said he loved the movie and loved how she got back at all the bastards that did that to her. Glad someone else loved the movie as much as I did.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|It was too off the wall for me.  Too much hipe for this movie.  Not worth renting.<br />To each his own.  I just didn't care for it.  Why don't they make good movies anymore....
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|MUST read if you've read the first two! This is the final book in the series and has some great twists in it! It also includes an extra chapter at the end that lets you in on what happens in the future, how everything turns out, and what happens to Katniss' life...I don't want to give it away ;)
B0056BMK6K|4.0|I found John'sbook chocked full of useful tips to market books. I plan to use many of his proven techniques to help sell my recently published novel \\"97 Miles South.\\" Thanks John.
B003AX0X3I|5.0|Parts of this compilation was released just after Jimi's untimely death and was titled \\"Cry Of Love\\", but this album is probably more of what Jimi had in mind.  You can really sense a new musical direction that Jimi was taking; every song is light years beyond his first album.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I liked the movie but had read the book first and I think wo reading the book first I would not have understood a lot about the movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The books along with the series just get better as you go. Loved it! A great love story along with some action!
B00348K1I6|5.0|Watch it! A great movie about a great man. Denzel owned it so well that I have a hard time separating the two!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have nothing bad to say about this book.<br /><br />I started bought this book on kindle from my ipad, synced it w/my kindle on my android and finished the book in about a week.  That is pretty amazing to say especially when i don't like to read.  I purposely wanted to finish the book, then had to buy the second book.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|This game worked fine on my Samsung epic but when I try to install it on my galaxy s3 it says it's not compatible. What's the deal?
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest. It is by far my favorite site, the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I do not find the search engine to work very well when trying to find something specific.  It's easier to google what you are looking for and then Pin it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Runs perfect on evo 3d, challenging but not frustrating, good choice of visuals and sound, easy to learn if young or new to touchscreen control, overall great game and a nice expansion of first one.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I bought this album after hearing and loving \\"tonight (we are young)\\" and I love every song! It's definitely worth the five dollars I spent in the album. Only thing is it has quite a bit of f-word action so you probably don't want to let kids listen... \\"carry on\\" is the best song in my opinion.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addictive!!!!!!  It is  a great way to spend a rainy or boring day!!!'  Just when you think you have it figured out some new level comes to throw you off!
B008602KQI|5.0|If you're looking for action, this movie's got it. I found this movie to be worth the price;good acting,good action...good purchase.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|By this time in the story the reader knows the  characters as well as members of their own family.  The story has twists and turns and surprises.  It builds from a realistic, historical feel to include more fanciful creatures and magic.  The reader has a whole world teaming is his/her head with all kinds of possibilities.  A very engaging and fun ride.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I didn't order this either.  Please correct your data base so this doesn't happen again.  Rather disturbing.  Thought maybe I had been ordering on my sleep.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was not worth one dollar, let alone five dollars.  Don't waste your money on it. Not typical of the author.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Even after 25 years of loving this show, I still get chills listening. I loved it as a kid, and now this concert reminds me why, plus shows me bits I've never noticed. Beautiful. Simply Beautiful.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|excellent story line, great actors.  Maggie Smith never fails to entertain and surprise you.  beautiful castle and grounds.  looking forward to Season 3!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It does what it claims to. Make sure to see all of the screens it offers. There is tons of good info to be seen.
B000VZYW1M|4.0|If you like music from this era you must have John Barleycorn Must Die. It's to Die for. This album & Low Spark of High Heel Boys are two of my favorites. Nothing that I'm aware of has been done recently to compare to this.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved it I have watched this movie 3 times plus I went to the theater 2 times to see it and loved it every time I watched it there is always something new you don't rennet seeing.
B005LAII0I|4.0|This tale is partially narrated by the evil queen (played by Julia Roberts) but a great deal of it eventually focuses on Snow White. The tale in itself would be predictable and dull if they didn't take certain liberties with the fairy tale. The biggest change is that Snow White is more of a heroine than a peaceful damsel in distress and she turns to banditry with her dwarf friends. There's a lot of light humor (sometimes using modern context) within which helps propel the tale forward.<br /><br />Lily Collins plays Snow White and Armie Hammer plays the charming prince, who ends up coming across as lovable oaf at times. At first he's to marry the wicked queen but his heart, of course, remains for Snow White. He does a good job when under the wicked queen's love potion (called \\"Puppy Love\\") but the real male stars are the dwarves. The epilogue shows what happens to the dwarf bandits who helped Snow White secure her kingdom. A dance score follows with the end credits.<br /><br />There are obvious themes of true love and believing in yourself. Nothing too deep, mind you, but all in light fun.<br /><br />Snow White is a tale from the Brothers Grimm. This particular version of it had a budget of $85M and so far has made over $162M at the Box Office.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; FAIRY TALE FOCUSES: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early September 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.
B008CP93S0|3.0|This movie wasn't great but wasn't bad either. I was super excited to see Jennifer and Paul in a movie together since I loved them in Object of my Affection. Wanderlust kind of let me down. I thought that they carried some of the jokes on to long.
B008KNUKVI|4.0|It's really a shame The Sing-Off was cancelled as it was the only \\"talent\\" show where all of the contestants had talent.  Pentatonix hit the ball out of the park with every performance.  Had this CD been a studio version of their performances on the show, it would have been outstanding.  There is something about the arrangements they did for The Sing Off that made each song a piece of addicting ear candy.  Many of the arrangements played with volume, pace, bringing different voices in and out, and sudden bursts of powerful sound followed by chilling silence.  Aside from \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\", and perhaps \\"Aha!\\", I found the rest of the arrangements rather flat.  Good, but not their best.  I am axiously awaiting what they do next.  It would be a shame if this is their one and only CD.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|Had a bad day at work? Kids won't be quiet? Traffic backed up and you can't get where you want? Why not settle down to a nice game of running over mutants! I love this game for a nice challenge of trying to top my previous record of distance as well as racking up zombie kills.
B008602KQI|3.0|I would say that the show was done to add to the advertisements for the books. It was an OK film, sometimes people talked too fast to understand what they were saying - when often it was important to understand the what and the why of the hunger games. Acting was OK - I felt that they didn't develop the characters very well in the beginning probably due to lack of time and large amount of content.  Others will rave about this movie I am sure - I just thought that the plot was rather thin and veiled -- maybe it will appear when episodes 2 and 3 come out?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOve LOVE all three books and im not a reader so this says alot!, I feel lost without a fifty book to read ! Cant wait for more from this author !!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case exceeded all my expectations. Thin, light and durable as well as waterproof. It's well worth the money!!  Especially if you have kids and you're worried about droppage or water damage.
B00338QENI|5.0|Who would have known that such a intriguing and fascinating story existed? My 19 year old daughter was assigned this book in college, so I figured I would read it to get a gist of what's expected in her lit class. Little did I know my journey into the life of the Immortal Henrietta Lacks would lead to such wonderful discoveries about life, science, and the human spirit. This book is a must read.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great book for women! I loved it, could not stop reading it.It's a story about love, sex, lust and it involves a mystery as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OMG!!  I am not a regular reader - but WOW!!!  I was HOOKED on these books - in fact - I have started them OVER again!!!  I think I'm in LOVE with Christian Grey!!!  A must read!!
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a good read. Very similar to Grey series. The story line was adequate and kept the reader interested. Not great literature but good escapism.
8866131024|5.0|It's the third year in a row I buy this little guy. Love the colors and the fact that it's hardcover!!!! I like having one page per day, but on the other hand I don't need to write much, so the tiny size is perfect for me. Let's face it, it's small so if you need to write a million different appointments this is definitely not for you, but for just a few to-do things a day it's perfect. I like the ribbon to mark the day you're on and the elastic to make sure it stays closed. The few pages in the front with monthly calendars are good and also the few in the back for general notes; nice that it's not a lot of them like other planners that fill up with random paper that bulks it up and you never use. Finally, the pocket in the back is perfect size for carrying business cards always with you.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great book! It was probably my favorite book in the fifty shades trilogy. Definitely must read books!
B008602KQI|3.0|Really hated that several of the key parts from the book had been changed or totally left out....like  where the mockingjay pin came from which was a very important part of the story.
B0012FB2MW|5.0|I'm 43 and can't believe I went all these years with only Faces songs I heard from the radio! They are/were phenomenal! Each song on this album I heard so far (there are a lot on here!) is a GEM! Rod Stewert, what happened? You were given your special voice to sing this type of material, the kind that's worthy of it! The band is perfection and their material should be re released so more people can hear it; they don't make them like this anymore! Quality rock and roll at it's finest! I highly, highly recommend this album! Thanks to Amazon for putting it on sale, otherwise I may not have bought it. Huge value with all these songs! Thanks!
B008JAGZDE|4.0|Good movie. I didn't expect this movie to be as good as this.  Looking oking forward to the next one.  Stiffler is the best and he finally gets his revenge after all these years, lol.
B008B8A9V8|5.0|What a great lillte book of knowledge with so many creative options!  I especially loved the bind offs - can't wait to try some of them!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and am so glad that they finally have an app.  It is as easy to use and navigate as the full site and repinning is fast and easy.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised reading this book. It picked up just where the first book left off. I would recommend it to anyone, not just young adults.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Title says it all: I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, and thought it was way better than book 4 (mostly for the characters it follows), but I was definitely disappointed by the ending, especially having heard how long it took him to come out with this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm completely obsessed with this app! Has everything and more! Great recipes and DYI projects! Once you start its hard to stop pinning!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Just a fun, whimsical, different kind of film. Interesting story, good acting. Leaves you smiling. Ewan McGregor is always a pleasure to watch.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very confusing at the start. Well written. Interesting characters ..  a bit absurd at times...the ending not at all to my liking. But strangely enough I could  not stop reading it. Janet B.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I found this book compelling and well written.  I could not put it down, and needed to find out what happened.  I also could relate to the story as a parent of young adolescents and teenagers, and thought that the characters,at least at first seemed similar to families that might live in any neighboring suburb or coummunity.  My book club will be discussing this book soon, and I can not wait to hear what others thought!  A must read and a great read for the summer.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Titillating:<br />I had no idea what the first book was about.  Imagine my surprise when I found it to be \\"X-Rated\\", but it did grab my attention.  A book for women, not a \\"prize\\" winner.  I am now reading the third book, so it must be a success.
B000TERK3C|5.0|I'm a long time Radiohead fan. This is one of my favorites. I needed to replace a physical CD so I decided to purchase a digital copy.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Great season each episode was amazing. Only show that I yell at the TV to tell people to watch out for Zombies
B008602KQI|4.0|I'm a huge fan of these novels and I think this film captures a lot of the emotion from the book.  The acting was a little less than brilliant.  However, as a compliment to the book, I thought this was fantastic, and I like watching it again and again.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen House was a great book. Reading the book tapped into a lot of emotions. I would read more from the author.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love, love, love it!  Came in the mail and packaged nicely.  No issues!  Love that I can watch it via the internet and the DVD!
B007ZLKKZM|5.0|Love how complete it seemed.  The music was wonderful.  It was the first time we used our new home theater system.  The title is so perfect.  Martin hit it on the head.
B007XGJK4G|3.0|In my opinion the movie is quite chaotic and long. The background story has not been structured together specially for those of us who do not know much about his life. His life seems quite dark from the context of the movie. There are though some lovely concert scenes. It could have been done much better.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You is Fifty degrees hotter than Fifty Shades. Sign me up for the rest of The Crossfire series!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|The Affair is an outstanding story. I fills in most of the information regarding Jach Reacher's and the Sherrif's relationship. It shows why she protects him the way she does in novels pertaining to later time periods.
B008602KQI|1.0|You requested a review. The disc we received was defective (would not spin up in the Blu-Ray player) and had to be returned.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie again, had forgotten how wonderful an actor Jimmy Stewart was...shame on me.  Amazon streaming video prices are fantastic for stay-at-home entertainment.
B008602KQI|5.0|The BlueRay Disc of this movie is fantastic.<br />The acting, characters, fast action and story are great, while keeping the soul of the book in tact.<br />As always, read the book first.
B0058BIYEU|5.0|This episode is one of the funniest.  The women are hilarious !  The \\"Wildebeest\\" is probably my favorite episode.  The writers are clever.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Never have I seen the subject of drug addiction and the attendant descent into hell depicted so artfully on screen.  This film is a masterful commentary on the awesome power of longing, loneliness and loss.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I read Dark Places after reading Flynn's other two books [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:0307341550 Sharp Objects: A Novel]].  While Dark Places was a good book and kept me reading, I did not find it as good as Flynn's other efforts.  This book seemed particularly violent and graphic and the story line, while interesting, did not hook me.  Dark Places follows Libby Day, the lone survivor of her family's slaughter at the hands of her brother when she was a young girl.  Day, now a grown woman, has spent her life living off the donations of a sympathetic public.  Now she is forced to reexamine her memories of the night her family died in order to keep money coming in.  The book alternates between Libby's point of view and flashbacks told from her dead mother and allegedly murderous brother's point of view.  I didn't find any of the characters sympathetic or likeable which seems to be a trademark of Flynn's writing.  As the story unfolded I found myself wanting to hurry up and get to the end because I found the characters so irritating.  While I thought the premise of this book was quite interesting and was worth a read, it's not one that I'll return to like Flynn's other books.  Even though I did not find it up to Flynn's other books, I still thought it was better than the majority of fiction on the market.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|The shipping was fast and the product was in excellent condition and obviously the movies were as good as I remember them. What more could I ask for?!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I bought the kindle version of this book after reading Flynn's Gone Girl (her third novel)and it did not disappoint.  Sharp Edges was her debut novel and had me hooked within a few pages.  Set in Wind Gap, Missouri,  Sharp Edges chronicles the return home of the Camille Preaker, a budding journalist who had relocated to Chicago to escape her past. Returning to Wind Gap to cover the abduction and possible murders of two young girls, Camille must face her disturbingly perfect mother, a Lolita like young half-sister she barely knows and a myriad of other colorful characters all while struggling with the memory of another sister's death years ago.  As in Flynn's other novels, Camille as the protagonist is not a particularly sympathetic character and makes some jarringly bad choices.  All in all I found this book riveting and immediately wanted to read more of Flynn's work.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I has worked very good so fork it will do a very good job with my pdf's and other  word doc.  Great tool to have.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Maybe it's because I don't usually read this type of novel, but this was really a waste of time. Poor writing and very little depth.
B008ASLQZW|5.0|Great follow up to the original. Good action, same as the first. Leaves you thinking there will be a another to make a trilogy.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|There's a lot more to this man than what is in this movie.  But for a racing \\"idiot\\" such as myself I still found the movie to be very well done, informative and captivating.  I knew nothing about Senna before watching the movie and now I just want to learn more.  I would happily recommend this movie to others and watch it again myself.  I wish I would have seen it in theaters when it was in town.
B0088WGBC8|5.0|Good suspense. Is he a good guy, or a bad guy? YOu got to watch the movie to find out. It's worth the time.
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|I have read most of Bukowski's work and even saw him speak in Los Angeles many years ago.  It's difficult for me to explain, but this book, as with many others of his, affect me in a visceral way that I carry with me for a long time afterward.  His prose is simplistic and spare, but always very powerful.  I'll return to these stories again and again over time.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Really amazingly well-constructed.  It weaves effortlessly through a non-chronological time structure, providing hints about relationships and other stories before and after you see them.  It is simiar to George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series but even more deeply woven.  Somehow even a chapter composed entirely of powerpoint slides does not come off pretentious.
B007SGM084|2.0|I was ready to put it down after book one but since I bought the trilogy i felt i needed to finish it. The most dragging book ever. I read Crossfire first and maybe thats why this one look so amatuerish.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It was great to get this game, I have played several times I am a bit of a solitaire junky and it is very easy to use on my lg phone.
0525953728|5.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" is not great literature. It lacks the profundity of Adam Brown's story in \\"Fearless\\" or the crisp clean narrative of Chris Kyle's \\"American Sniper\\". This is not Shakespeare.  But I couldn't put it down.  While Bill Clinton was soaking up the adulation of the Democratic National Convention and Robert Irvine was bringing order to the culinary world in the background, I read this great book from cover to cover.  I wanted to hear the truth about the killing of Osama bin Laden from a man who was there. I wanted to be able to counter the idiotic charges of Pentagon lawyers that this consummate military professional would divulge information damaging to national security.  Threatening \\"Mark Owen\\" with legal consequences just because he failed to obtain clearance to publish this story is more of the same bureaucratic bullying that sickens the citizens of this country \\"Mark\\" served and defended.  We have the right to know the truth of this story, unvarnished by the opinion of some idiot Washington lawyer.  The book is respectful.  Now let us see the pictures.<br /><br />Read page 299.  Most of the proceeds of this book will go to charity.
B0086700CM|4.0|The graphics are way awesome. My 6 year old is better at it than I am though, lol. I can see how it could become addicting!
0142410705|4.0|So, this book was assigned to my kids for summer reading.  Actually, it was the book the school chose to assign to ALL the students.  I'm guessing, that is about 2000 students.  With that many locals reading the book, it seemed like a good choice for me, too.<br /><br />I opened the book in the morning, and just turned pages all day, reading until the end.  Good book.  But several times, I was jarred from my reverie by poor editing--hence the 4 stars.  Actually, I'd give it 3.5 if I could, but rounded up instead of down, due to good story.  Amazon.com suggests the appropriate age for this book is 12 and up.  Given the amount of sex concepts, I'd say at least 13, and for most kids, 14 or 15.<br /><br />Lots of reviews talk about the story, I'll describe a few examples of editing concerns.<br /><br />Early on, I was frustrated that Hassan's parents are shown telling Hassan to call home while he is away, but he is never shown calling home once.  Story should have avoided having the father tell him to call.<br /><br />The author obviously fell prey to Green's desire to share and preach little bits of random information.  Sharing information enough to suit the story, fine.  But he overdid it.  Two examples:  The comment about how much water to drink overshot the mark, and became preachy.  The shower curtain info was interesting, but was obviously shoehorned into the story.<br /><br />Anagrams play a significant role in this book.  But the author has to reach so far to get the right anagrams sometimes, that he messes with the language to make them work right.  Generally, Green's pros flow so well that every time I found the phrasing stilted, I was surprised.  And then my surprise turned to momentary irritation, when it was invariably followed by an anagram.  Like YRS FOREVER.<br /><br />For some reason, there is a minimally discussed dog in the story.  It was not well described when introduced, stuck in oddly later, and never used for anything that moved the story along.  It didn't seem to represent anything.  I couldn't figure out why it was included at all, and I kept waiting for it.  Distracting.<br /><br />Finally, I sincerely wish the author had researched the product made at the factory better.  His description of the product simply isn't accurate, and I couldn't help feeling that a female author would never have made the error.  Perhaps Green needed a product, and just had trouble coming up with one.  This one had a humor factor, so he used it.  But the description of the factory and the product were jarring for me, because they didn't make sense, in a story that is pretty reality-based.<br /><br />There are more, but this is certainly more than enough for a review!<br /><br />Again, I did really like the book, despite its flaws.  Given that other reviewers have said \\"[[ASIN:0142402516 Looking for Alaska]]\\" is better, I am interested in reading that one next.It didn't seem to represent anything.

B000W93CHC|5.0|After a year using a tablet with an e-book reader, I finally downloaded a book I decided to start reading right away. So in addition to a good read, I'm enjoying the transition from paper pages to the wonderful world of electronic reading. I'm hooked. Anyway, only half-way done with a 1000 plus page book - but it's very much in the spirit of 'Pillars of the Earth'. Soon to be an 8-part mini-series this October on the Reelz cable channel. Good plot, enjoyable characters, Follett vividly creates the medieval world - I really feel I'm in the 14th century while reading - a great respite from reality.
B004LROUNG|2.0|The characters are uninteresting. The plot is not unusual. I'm very disappointed because I usually like Grishm - but this one is not a winner.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|While searching for a battery meter app.  I found so much more than that.  It is simple and accurate.  Does its job well.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Enjoyable way to kill some time. Easy to play -- very intuitive, with great explanations for new features. Could even help keep your mind sharp as you get older. Might even be helpful for you as you age.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Nice entertainment nothing special. Interesting special effects. As a result downloaded the John Carter series by Edgar Rice Burroughs for further read.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I read this book and after getting about half way through it came to the conclusion that it was absolute rubbish. The story is stupid, the main characters are stupid and I am sorry that I spent good money downloading it.
B000FC10MU|5.0|This book was worth my time.  It has made me view the world around me differently.  It has made me appreciate the relationships I have with other people and with favorite places.  I think most Americans would enjoy reading it.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are awesome. I haven't been able to put them down. I started re-reading as soon as I finished the first time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy is awesome.  These books were passed around in my facility, after reading the first I did not want to wait so I purchased Darker and Freed for my IPad.  I read the first book in two (2) days.  I read the last book (Freed)extremely slow because I did not want it to END.  Congrats to E.L.James.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book had me from the instant I started reading it. Can not wait for the 2nd book to come out!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book changed my life. It is a dry and technical in places  but the  diet plan and the concepts are wonderful. This is a must read for people who are experiencing any health issues.  Read this before taking dangerous drugs or having surgery.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|You can never put everything in a movie that was in the book....think this movie did a great job of including the important plot details.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I had another brand that I did not like. This one is amazing. Great sound and a tape that doesn't repeat itself for a good 15-20 minutes. As realistic as one could ask for.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|This movie is riviting for all the children and adults that I have had the opportunity to show it to. Fine family fun and entertainment
B0083GPDBO|3.0|Looks like it could be a good show but I was watching with three of my kids ages 12-16 and I did not feel it was appropriate for them.  We ended up turning it off and not completing it.  Others may really enjoy it, just not for me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A great, fun read with a great twist at tne end.  Loved it as much as his other books.  Real good feeling book.
B0000262QW|5.0|I am an acoustic jazz fan, and frequently find jazz/ fusion of the 70's pretty ho-hum once you get past Weather Report's \\"Birdland.\\" I think that electronic instrumentation \\"flattens\\" jazz, causing it to lose it's feel of being a conversation. Early Return to Forever, however, it the exception. Though the sound is different, relying heavily on Brazilian beats instead of classical jazz swing, and Corea using an electric piano, the music retains the diaphanous feel and texture of jazz. You get the feeling that the musicians are really listening to each other.<br /><br />From the opening track to to end, this album is maravilloso. Corea, Airto and Clark are fantastic, liquid and subtle as a rhythm section. And the fact that Joe Farrell's main solo instrument is the flute makes the music instrument. And Flora Plume's voice weaves in and out of the music, being used more like an instrument than as a voice intoning lyrics.<br /><br />Every song on the CD is fabulous, earthy and yet spiritual. It opens with the upbeat \\"Return to Forever,\\" and melts into the soft, dreamy tones of \\"Crystal Silence,\\" a tune which ranks beside only Miles Davis' \\"Blue in Green\\" from \\"Kind of Blue\\" as the gentlest jazz ballad of all time. The very playful exuberance of  \\"What Game Shall We Play Today\\" picks the mood up.<br /><br />Which leaves us with the masterful finale, \\"Sometime Ago - La Fiesta.\\" This is a wonderful example of \\"Third Stream,\\" where improvisation twines around pre-written sections. It is handled so well on this CD, with the sections providing wonderful contrast as the piece builds to a perfect, upbeat crescendo.<br /><br />All in all, I think this album should be in every serious jazz aficionado's collection. At the very least, if you and your lady-friend need to do a little snuggling with a bottle of wine, and, like me, cannot bear Barry White... :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the best of the three books. By the time we reach book three, we are completely drawn into these characters. I hated to see the series end. Not only because it is erotic but because of the love story. Highly recommended.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|It's funny I don't like cats, but I do love this movie.  It is an adorable tale of a two cats and adventure.  A millionaire leaves her inheritance to her cat, Duchess and her kittens, and the greedy butler decides he wants the money so he kidnaps Duchess.  An alley cat, Thomas O'Malley, and his friends jump in to save the day.  There are fun songs, adorable kittens, and just mischief in this movie.  It is a classic Disney movie and makes me laugh everytime I see it.  It actually reminds me of 101 Dalmations but with cats!<br /><br />With the new Blu-ray edition you both the DVD and a Blu-ray disc, which I love because I keep the DVD in the car and Blu-ray in our family room.  The animation and sound have been remastered to update the movie, but it still has the classic animation from when it was originally released in the 1970.  There are also lots of Bonus Features available on the discs, which we haven't even had a chance to check them all out.  Overall, this is a great Blu-ray/DVD set to add to your collection!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the most beautiful production to come along in years. Fabulous storyline, characters, scenery. It has it all. We watched the first year's series on Netflix streaming and couldn't wait for year 2, so we bought season 2 on CD at Amazon. The only bad thing is that we couldn't quit watching it and finished the CD too quickly! Now we have to wait for season 3.[[ASIN:B005Q1W10A Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 2 (Original U.K. Edition)]]
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I really enjoy using this app at the end of a long day to unwind.  It allows you to choose several sounds at once so you have a lot of control to listen to exactly what you want and there is a wide variety of sounds and music.  I rated it with 3 stars because it does not allow you to play your selection and then use another app.
B00117XLO8|4.0|I have never seen the First seasons and wanted to see how it all began.  Watched with my eldest daughter and son-in-law.  We all like supernatural.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love this series. I can easily read one book in less than a week. It is very hard to put it down!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Wonderful book explaining the simple daily things that most people don't understand can make or break them.  It's hard to realize how those little steps can compound into massive success down the road.  This book explains that very well.  I am recommending it for everyone I know.
B000QE9ERK|4.0|This movie is based on the book El Club Dumas.  Unfortunately, everything about Alexandre Dumas and the modern day club was cut from the movie.  In the book, the club served as a red herring regarding the intrigue surrounding the search for the ancient books to decipher the key to invoke Satan by means of the nine portals. To the reader, the twists and turns of the plot created a surprise ending. Although I can understand why the characters were americanized for American audiences, having read the book in the original Spanish, I was disappointed at those changes.  As to the mysterious young woman, while I understood her to be an angel, the movie portrays her as a devil.  In spite of the many differences between the book and the movie, the action and suspense in the movie made for good viewing.  I wouldn't mind watching the movie again.
B0086700CM|4.0|While this game is challenging, its even more challeging to download. -.-<br />Anyhow, this game is great for people with good reflexes.<br />Even if you don't have good reflexes, this game is still great.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This is In This Moments best album yet. It's hard its gritty and kicks you right in the teeth! Don't get ne wron all of there albums freaking rock. A star crossed wasteland was my favorite, then ther was Blood.... Baddass! Buy this album! It will blow you away.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The title of the second book of this trilogy is misleading.  Its a little softer around the edges, not darker as the title suggests. Or maybe by the time you read this one, the shock of Christian's secret has worn off.  Either way, being an armchair psychologist, I was glad to find out what led up to Mr. Gray's choice of lifestyle.  And for those who agree with Ana about Mrs. Robinson, I think you'll be thrilled with the ladies' tete-a-tete.  I know I was!  Laters, baby!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|We purchased this without seeing it at the Theatre.  Have to say it was better than we expected.  The special effects were good and liked the fact that the language was clean.  Good movie for young adults.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved all the books this Author has written..could not put them down and I<br />think Gone Girl would make a great movie!
B008602KQI|5.0|Even though the movie deviated a bit from the book I thought it was amazing.  The gory scenes were not too bad, which I appreciated.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I really loved this read because I found it made me think a little deeper into what it must really be like to cope with disability. I have no experience of being wheelchair bound nor have I ever cared for a profoundly disabled person so I was moved by the insight Jojo gave me through this story. Mostly I liked the honesty of her characters and the simplicity of the setting. I could imagine this book as a play on stage. This book deals with a very sensitive issue and I believe it succeeds in raising the question within the reader as to how  would you cope if asked to participate in such an event. It is a very morbid subject but she delivers it so full of humor that it makes for a very enjoyable read.<br />I will seek out and read another of JoJo Moyles's books.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Loved this movie. I liked it better when I watched it the second time. It's a good one for all ages.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Does what it says!! Relaxing! Good menu & selection! Would purchase this app again! It is reliable. There have been no problems. I like having the timer, makes it convenient.
B005XLN77O|5.0|I bought this set for my daughter's 8th birthday - she loves it!  I comes with 4 dresses, and 3 pens, 2 stencils and a small pack of stickers as well as a new doll.  She took to it right away - and we will likely need to get refill packs soon -<br />I encouraged her to try her designs on paper before the dress to help her plan it out.  Also -<br />I am not sure if its explained, but after you tear the dress from the paper that surrounds them, turn them inside out - the marker designs go through the dress, so you can see it - (just avoid words or write them in mirror image) and place stickers on AFTER you turn inside out - the dress fits better that way.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Pretty much all no bs fact about hypertrophy training. If you want to see results read this and stay disciplined. You will get where you want to be. I did.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was a fast read that leaves you thinking at the end. The ending was a little unsatisfying but I would still recommend reading the book.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I was glad to have the preview, but if I had realised how short the book was I might have left it at that. Aside from length, it was a clever, witty, laugh out loud book! Glad I had seen 30 rock, as there was a decent chunk on that.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the best Trilogy I have ever read. So detailed and just kept you hooked ever second. Wished there was a Christian in every woman's life.! Will definitely help your love life.<br /><br />~Jennifer B.
B002NZTZ8S|1.0|It is not worth the money I paid for it, it is 3-D but not as good as most of the 3-D movies Ive bought, it just doesn't have the special effects that 3-D should have or that's my opinion..Thanks.............
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book is well written and keeps you turning pages.  I had a hard time putting the book down. If you like a good suspense novel, this is highly recommended!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just as good as the first two. Couldn't put if down. Takes a really good book to grab my attention like these books did.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I loved this book, once I started it I could NOT put it down.  I personally think its one of Steel's top ones!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Starts out a bit slowly...but worth it to get to the plot twist that ultimately unravels a fascinating story of a truly diabolical character and some very unsuspecting and unfortunate victims. Loved the clever narrative structure, with the main characters revealing the telling details little by little, manipulating the reader's emotions and suspicions, and culminating in an intricate and satisfying climax. Frightening to think that something like this actually could happen. I read it on my Kindle (on the treadmill) at the gym...it definitely motivated me to come back each day to see what happened next!
B006G2124E|2.0|This movie was so silly and contrived. How many people have toilets just sitting around to  donate?? Come on! Like the Blind Side, just another simplistic \\"feel good\\" movie with no substance.
B0084242OG|4.0|I didn't get into this until the season was over, but what a guilty pleasure! Love it! Intrigue, melodrama, murder, ruin, all in the name of revenge. It's ridiculous, but a lot of fun. Check it out.
B008602KQI|4.0|Movie had good video and sound quality. Editing was average to rough, causing confusion to the viewer in places. Movie should have had about 10-15 minutes put back in that were probably left on the cutting room floor. Additional scenes or longer scene transitions would have made the story line smoother. Parents, do not let pre-teens or youger see this. Movie should have had an \\"R\\" rating due to the violence. This is a \\"Lord of the Flies\\" type movie without the class or insights. Characters are flat with little development. Overall, a good mindless action movie for adults or mature teens for a stay at home weekend.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|extra period piece.  Jane Austin at her best.  I'm a Jane fan.  /Excellent look at the interworking of Edwardian England.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never been much of a reader..as a matter of fact this is the first book or series I have completed entirely.  Other books have never really kept my interest.  Trying to find more books to read similar to this trilogy.  So if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book. Kept my attention the whole time & had trouble putting it down. If I didn't have kids to take care of it would've been finished in two days. I highly recommend it :o)
B0063GORYU|4.0|Easy to play but still fun, this is a good game to kill time.  It seems easy but every so often a tough combination pops up and really challenges you.
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie is phenominal, just like the book. Some details were lacking in the movie, but overall a great film. If books haven't been read, I suggest reading them.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was good, but too many differences for my taste. If I had never read the book it would rock!
B008602KQI|4.0|I've seen this movie twice in the theatre and now once on DVD.  Each time I've been on the edge of my seat with my heart racing.  This is a great combination of the \\"world\\" created by Suzanne Collins and of the artistry of Gary Ross in bringing that \\"world\\" to sight.  Each performer is \\"spot on,\\" though Stanley Tucci's \\"Caesar\\" and Donald Sutherland's \\"President Snow\\" are the most memorable.  That, of course, reflects the skill of the actors.
B008XG1X18|4.0|love the web sit and so glad they filnly have a app for it the only problem it freezes every one and away.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This was a fascinating book, which showed great imagination on the part of the author Stieg Larsson.  I liked so well that I am almost through with book two and have ordered book three.
B006ATJXQW|2.0|I had a lot higher hopes for this book! I was kind of bored reading it and it didn't flow very well especially compared to how outstanding the other books were.
B005EPFEPM|5.0|A must see film for everyone.  Cannot begin to put into words the beauty and power of this film. One of those rare documentaries you can't stop thinking or talking about.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Very good video.  I would have given it a 5-star, except for the fact that it left out too much of the story.  I reccommend that the individual read the book first.  Then the characters stand out more, and the movie watcher can follow the story better.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Ok, so i will admit i am a huge acapella music fan. I fell in love with this group when they were on the singoff show. But regardless of whether you like acapella music or not, you have to check these guys out because besides great vocals, their bass and percussion guys are ridiculously talented. Never thought I could bounce in my car to acapella! :-)<br /><br />Can't wait until their next release!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I've used this app for over a month and I really like it. I loaded on my kindle fire and so far no problems. For free its ok with me!
B008602KQI|5.0|Very good movie. Some scenes were not quite what I imagined after reading the book. However, still a very entertaining movie and am looking forward to the sequels.
B000V6ACKG|5.0|This is of course one of the top 5 classics of all time.  My young sons listen to it all the time!  Easy download and it's saved online for you.
B00846REIS|3.0|I liked it except for the very crude language.  It does follow the same basic storyline of Fifty Shades of Grey.  However, having said that, it is not written nearly as well.  It is written with a staccato feel to it and the language is just very crude!  I will go on to read the second book when it comes out though.  Towards the middle to end of the first book it does suck you in enough to make you want to hang in there for the second book.  Being the hopeless romantic that I am, I guess I'm hooked!
B0072NWKEC|4.0|I have read other Bernie Guenther books by Philip Kerr and enjoyed them all. Prague Fatale takes the story to Berlin at the time when Hitler was  coming  into power and Jews were being targeted for \\"relocation.\\" The detective finds himself investigating the murder of an SS officer which took place at the home of a SS general during a gathering of top Nazis in Prague. Kerr paints a powerful picture of how the German people were dehumanized and made so fearful of saying or doing anything which might bring the wrath of the Gestapo on them, that the unthinkable could have happened! The author illustrates what can happen when freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion are suppressed and lost! Very chilling!
B000FBFML6|5.0|Intrigue, plot and fantasy galore, the entire series never fails to be engrossing and fascinating.  Magic, dragons, inner emotional turmoil, a dream world that becomes a part of reality through Fitz Chivalry's daughter Nettle and the skill, and a love between a Fool/mystical changer of the future and a man/wolf, and that man and his own wolf Nighteyes through a communication called the wit, make this wonderful reading for many.<br />Sometimes the plot and ruminations of the characters become a bit too heavy handed and slow, but on the whole I love these books by Robin Hobb.<br />Bravo!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Had to read to find out what the fuss was about.It's a love story about two people with divergent background.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games book was a great read. It really surprised me how much I was pulled into the story. I can say that it's definitely a book worth reading. If you end up liking this book, you will absolutely love the second and third books too!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Diana don't know her magic. So, what?  I still don't get why it is such a big deal.  Matthew was spying on her for his race's survival. So how or why did he fall in love with her?<br /><br />I was delighted by Diana or maybe by the unique mix of science and magic.<br /><br />Honestly, the character development wasn't to my liking.  At all.<br /><br />So, 3 stars for the creative mix but I am not going to buy the next ones if I get tempted to read the rest of the series at all.
B004T6IBNY|4.0|I started out with the free version and I enjoyed it so much I bought the full version. I have had a great time sitting and playing pinball for hours. I also like how to use the flipper you only have to tap which side of the screen it is on, this helps avoid the problem when your fingers slow migrate away for a button on a touch screen. I really wish this app was formated for the MacBook Pro as well.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Lots of action, very interesting, AND I watched it twice, so it was definitely a great movie. A must see.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Loved the series, was really exited about this book coming out. I was not disappointed.  Has the same excitement in it as the others , and great characters.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This series is great. So many characters to keep straight it can get confusing if you don't really focus. The storyline is very creative and doesn't follow any path that is predictable. No character is safe. I felt so invested in each character and as each book ended, I couldn't wait to get into the next one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow!!! What a crazy story. After you get into it you won't be able to put it down!!<br />There is one surprise after another!![[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was actually (in my opinion) much better than the first one. The only reason I decided to read the second book was because of the first book's ending. I hated/loved the way the author did that. Good idea. Anyways, the book 2 is a must read.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|'Kick Ass' is the perfect title for the movie. The first time I saw it I was very impressed with everything about it. (I used to study film in college and enjoy a well crafted movie.)<br /><br />So for those of you who have put off seeing this film my advice is don't be. You'll enjoy it, its a very well done film, even if it is over the top with violence (which I'm not a fan of)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My daughter and I cannot stop playing.  We have completed all the missions twice and we still keep playing. Get it while it is still free. It's hard to believe such an awesome game is free!  ; )
B008ASLK8A|1.0|This moviE SUCKS, it was so slow and boring that I could not even bring myself to watch the whole thing, watching the trailer was far more enjoyable that the movie its self. Do yourself a favor and save your money dont rent this movie unless you cant sleep and need very much to get some rest, in that light the movie works GREAT!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the style of writing in this book.  Great suspense.  Great humor.  All in all, a fantastic read and I highly recommend it.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|This moviw as many others look good in the trailer but was a disappointment in full length, I wound not recommend this to anyone this movie lacked a good story line good acting and any really good action scenes.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Love James Taylor songs as they remind me of things that happened in my past. Great to hear all the hits in one place.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes it is true this book is hot! If you liked the twilight series this is a grown up version
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think this trilogy was gr8. Can't wait to see if she comes out with a Christian view. I fell in love with the character
B003O86FMW|5.0|For anyone who enjoyed The Hunger Games, book 2 to the trilogy just adds more zest to what we thought we already knew. Twists and turns and an unexpected outcome!
B008602KQI|5.0|this was an awesome move to see at the theatre's and i couldn't wait to get my own copy on dvd!  its a different take on style and lots of action!
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|Once again Fiona Apple delivers a stellar album full of delightful songs.<br />Gems in their own right and they grow on you, very well and blossom into wonderful pieces.<br /><br />She is a stellar artist and has been since the outset of her career, despite being in the pop realm and also being elusive of that at the same time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very good book alot of twists in it kept me reading didn't want to put it down. Recommended it to alot of people.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The writer gives a very open and honest account of her life as she describes her journey on the Pacific Crest Trail. Very inspiring!
B008M34INW|1.0|Did NOT like this movie at all and usually I'm into the action type of flick.  The plot was hard to follow and there seemed to be a lot of stupid, nonsensical points in the movie.  Definitely not one of Mel Gibson's top 5.  Sorry that I spent the money on it.
B004FPJ87W|5.0|Rented La Dolce Vita to use as an opportunity to hear the Italian language and practice my pronunciation of words.  It was very beneficial in this way, yet in the process I was also introduced to a beautiful piece of cinema and storytelling that I would not have come across otherwise. For those less interested in the language and more in the story itself, there are English subtitles throughout the film.<br /><br />Ciao!
B0065CCM76|5.0|love love love bob seger.  now i can listen whenever i want!<br /><br />downloaded this in upstate new york.  even got a fast connection.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love browsing Pinterest on my phone now. It's fast and easy to repin items as well as add new categories to your own wall.
B008COD5OO|1.0|No really , just watch Superbad instead. Its a silly remake without a plot. Yes we are allowed to write one star reviews. If everyone only wrote reviews for movies they liked , every movie would get 5 star reviews and there would be no bad movies.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|We like this dictionary a lot. It finds words fast and we really like that it lists synonyms, sentence examples. A great space saver as well. :)
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|This album is great! My kids love Hot knife, the last track. The album is filled with fantastic piano and drum work and Fiona's voice remains fantastic. The songs are her typical heart wrenching heartbroken ballads. This is definitely one of the top albums of the year.
B007SGM084|4.0|This is a good book if you like a lot of sex.  There is always something going on to keep you reading.
B008602KQI|5.0|I AM ALWAYS SKEPTICAL ABOUT A MOVIE,WHEN I PREVIOUSLY READ THE BOOK. THIS MOVIE CAPTURED THE CORE OF THE BOOK EFFORTLESSLY!!! THE CLIFF HANGER EFFECT IS SPECTACULAR. IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW WHO DIDN'T READ THE TRILOGY, I WOULD DOWNLOAD IT IMMEDIATELY,BEFORE CATCHING FIRE IS RELEASED NEXT YEAR.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I like the book alot though I thought it was kinda confusing. I didn't get how the creditswere linked to dollars and controling the avatars whole body with only the gloves.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've finally gotten around to reading this book and I wish I had read it much sooner!! I loved this book and I'm looking forward to the next one!
B008YYCUES|4.0|I really love this show. The acting is wonderful with a cast that was selected by a genius.<br /><br />This is the kind of TV that makes us look forward for the next episodes. Keep it up Amazon.
B008602KQI|5.0|I am rather disappointed that I cannot share this movie with my granddaughter.  I have challenged her to read the book and only then, with my son and daughter-in-law's permission, will I allow her to watch the movie.  I think there are positive messages that would inform any young person's sense of responsibility and the role of risk taking versus surrendering to what may seem to be the inevitable.  That is, a person can overcome and a person never really knows ahead of time what attributes they possess that may allow them to overcome what seem to be insurmountable odds.  I am keenly awaiting the arrival of Catching Fire and Mockingjay.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Awesome Set Book! Really Well packaged, fast service and delivery. I will definitely buy again soon.<br />Love it so much!
