B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was really realistic. I couldn't stop reading it. Some nights I would stay up until 3 in the morning just wanting to know who would be on the tape next. Jay Asher sure did a very nice job on this one!

B004JN1CW4|5.0|I loved the book and a great condition to this series and best of all it made a conviction to my 5th grade year and I'll be reading the author`s other books!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I really appreciate the auto correct in this app it not only correct ts your words but it learns so that it gets them right because it starts learning how you pit your sentences together.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Overall this is a great game except for the fact that it doesn't update  until like twelve or so days after it was released on Apple and Android. Please fix this
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My 2 yr old daughter absolutely loves all Dr. Panda apps. I can actually take a shower or do dishes if she's playing. They are all very interactive and really imaginative. In fact, I have been caught playing once she's done.

0767817478|5.0|I think this movie is such a good movie. If I never first saw the movie when I was a littl kid, I would never knew who Godzilla really is.<br /><br />I love this movie and the Japanese Godzilla movies.<br /><br />Godzilla, you are my hero.
B00867GJYK|5.0|I was so excited when &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; finally became available on Blu-ray.  I remember seeing this for the first time at the theatre and was mesmerized.  The Blu-ray quality does not disappoint!

B00755646W|5.0|This movie/documentary was ahead of it's time chronicling The Blond Ambition Tour.  I don't know why it took so long to come out on blu-ray though.  This was the concert that put Madonna on the map and she has set the standard for concerts ever since.
B001TH44VY|5.0|The movie Amadeus is literally the best one I've ever watched in my life! The way it's set out makes it feel like its the 1700's! I love the music played in there and it's just really great!! 😀
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I really like this stylus!  My hands do not get tired writing with it and is precise.  This  very sturdy and seems that it will last a long time!
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Interested strategy game requires some thought to deck composition similar to MTG in gameplay. Requires some grinding and buying cards with in-game gold. If you drop some money in it, there's no guarantee is for a specific deck. My advice is start with a chaos main deck and an order alt deck.after I bought the 200 runes and gambled on the cards, order became my main deck by far. Challenging, but not impossible to do without money. Definitely gameloft best game I've played.<br />Enjoy.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|I have  to admit. Is a  just browsing the new releases that were actually available for checkout when this book caught my eye. Mainly th  cover and after reading the description I thought, \\"what not?\\" . After experiencing how suicide changes lives forever I was  interests  in the storyline.<br />I was  hooked. I read this book in one day. I found myself unable to put it down. Intriguing and certainly kept my interest. I would highly recommend to anyone.<br />It has so many lessons to he learns  within its pages while keeping you on the edge of your seat.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This is a great game.  Time just goes by when playing this game. I think everybody should play this game.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|There is nothing I can say about this film that has not already been said. Watch it, or choose to be ignorant.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have tried numerous white noise apps, and this one is by far the best! There is a good array of sounds to fit any mood, and the binaural(?) portion is wonderful!  I've used this app for both sleep and for blocking out sounds while studying, and it had done a fabulous job of both.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Why is it that so many good films go un-noticed?<br /><br />My wife and I watched it at home and ended up cheering, which is something we do not normally do for movie characters.<br /><br />This movie is not what you think, but it will not disappoint.<br /><br />I'm going to find what the critics said about this film, so I can know what critics I should be following.<br /><br />Jude Law is MASTERFUL!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|The mujsic is good and the acting natural. If you don't mind reading subtitles (they speak in Japanese) you'll enjoy it. The Japanese people's respect for the &#34;departed&#34; is admirable.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Because the author is Sylvia Day and because she is such a fabulous writer, I can give her no less than three stars. That said, I was confused by this story. It read like a series of days instead of a complete plot. There wasn't a significant conflict or climax. In fact, the story just stopped. I really wanted a cliffhanger, another conflict that had me needing the next story. Still, I am looking forward to the 4th and 5th book. I'm hoping for more and am confident Ms. Day will deliver.
1439190275|5.0|Dr. Westman's book and diet plan has helped my husband and I to regain our health. This diet plan is great because I was NEVER hungry on it. I discovered that I had hyperinsulinism (extreme carb cravings) so, once I completely cut them from my diet, I lost a ton of weight and had a lot more energy. Hubby and I are now in kung fu class where an assistant instructor thought I was 20 years younger. Sweet Boy!
B009YN2M7S|3.0|To start off, romance really isn't my genre. But after reading all the great reviews on here & friends speaking highly of this author, I thought I'd give it a try.<br />It took a longgg time to get to the point! In the beginning, all I could think was \\"ok.. she lives in a cottage. I get it!\\" It wasn't until Kevin came into the picture, that it got good for me.<br />The romance was very cliche for me.<br />The action part was great, I couldn't stop reading and the ending was beautiful.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|pretty good game.  wish it was more interactive.  i like the ones that u have to do more than hog.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is an awesome knife...I highly recommend to anyone looking for a good quality American made knife. You just cant go wrong with a kabar
B00B47NO2O|1.0|Warning: some minor spoilers here but hopefully I can convince you to not waste time and money on this show. While the plot sounds like something I should be very interested in, this show was painful to watch. Every episode left me angry over how stupid they make every protagonist out to be. I understand they have to keep the plot running and if the good guys are too good, the bad guys would be caught and the show would be over. But instead, they've made the bad guys seem like they can predict the future and the good guys not know their a** from a hole in the ground. They want you to believe that a large group of random strangers on the internet suddenly became obsessed with this one serial killer in prison and are able to coordinate an intricate plan among everyone that infiltrates and outsmarts every level of law enforcement. Meanwhile, the FBI \\"experts\\" are the dumbest, most incompetent people on the planet. I think what it comes down to is lazy writing.  Let's put one cop on surveillance detail so that person you thought was innocent can show their true evil colors and get away. Need backup? Let's send Kevin Bacon and one other FBI agent to make sure that everybody gets away. Have the house surrounded? Someone on the SWAT team is a follower. The main bad guy breaks out of jail TWICE FFS!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Such a fun game. A lot of fun trying to beat my score and building new armour. The mach 2 is pretty cool
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Loved the movie!!!  It did show up in letterbox forum which did not look right on our large TV.  We did manage to stretch it a bit so I was not distorted.  Overall Amazon video rentals...100% better than the service from Direct TV
B000P12LWY|5.0|There's something for everyone in this series.  The costumes, the colors, the music...history accurate or not I loved it.<br />I started the series on TV in the 3rd season and I loved it.  Found the first 2 seasons and watched them to see what I missed.<br />I'm all caught up on all the seasons but I liked the staging and photography in the last episode the BEST!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game. It is fun and addicting. A person can be anywhere from 5 to 75 and still have fun. I think that there should be more vehicles though. Like a police car!

B00BUAEYVK|3.0|Yes it has action but just not what we have come to expect in a &#34;Die Hard&#34; movie. More of a &#34;Die Hard comes to grips with his son&#34; movie.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|A movie that a macho man can watch  Great story , beautiful photography, great acting.<br />Will require GIANT bowls of popcorn.
B004HD61KE|5.0|As always James Rollins delivers a great book. I don't understand how he doesn't get the same attention other authors of our day enjoy. I always love to see how he weaves history and science into a thrilling story.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Don't believe the negativity!  This is a great end to a great series!  It was just how I thought it should end!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is the most funniest game I ever played I let my niece play and she said she loved it so she went on vacation and I started playing and I loved it so much I started playing everyday
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its easy to navigate between different versions of the Bible on this app. The books of the Bible are easy to find. Overall this app is wonderful.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|The cutter takes a lot of practice..Just have a lot of bottles because you will lose many of them..All in all, I think once I get the hang of this I will be happy with this product and won't cuss near as much..Thanks
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Something fun to put on my Kindle. Gives you a good a colorful read out to minimize running out of juice.
0131480057|5.0|In the typical *nix style this book is not dry, with little bits of comedic interest / puns / plays on words strewn throughout. The authors take what can be tedious subject matter and makes it readable. Highly reccomend for anyone using *nix systems in a buisiness environment, or even the curious hobbyist. This handbook can serve as quick reference or extended learning, and will take you from  &#34;that nerd who doesn't use windows&#34; to &#34;that geek that can get around and actually do pretty neat things in linux!&#34;
B00A83075M|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, and I am so glad I did. I purchased it in an early order, and by the time it came out it was cheaper at another store; so Amazon gave me the difference in the prices to match the competitor!!
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|I find these games more like books with puzzles. Good HO. Hints were helpful. I played it on a Kindle Fire, so objects were not too small.
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|A continuation of the first season but with a different twist.  Again once you start watching its hard to stop.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|I loved this game, I had to complete all 100 levels, very addicting and fun. It a great mind game, sorry it ended at 100, I would still be playing it.
0439023491|4.0|This second book of the Hunger Games trilogy seems to start off a bit slow. I think the feeling comes from the fact that the Suzanne Collins has to set the scene and fill us in on what Katniss has been up to since participating in the Hunger Games. The first book ends by leaves you hanging off the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. So this feeling is what makes the beginning of the second book seem slow. But the slow start does well in further developing the characters and the plot.The further you get onto the book, the faster the pace gets.Suzanne Collins gets the readers warmed up with a casual walk and then increases it to a run. Well before the end on the book you are in an all out sprint. I took my time reading the first half of the book. I stayed up into the early morning hours to devour the last half of the book because I couldn't put it down. Another excellent journey of the mind!
B004SBX112|5.0|this one like the other angry birds keeps the kids occupied in the car on long car rides , it is wonderful
B000U6BT40|5.0|I just love the people in this show.  Colin Ferguson is just great.  Fargo, Jo, Zoe, Vincent, Henry, Nathan, everyone who is portrays these roles really delivers.  I would love to live in Eureka!  I know Sheriff Jack Carter would keep us safe!  What a cool place!
B006VA57CY|5.0|Used Amazon Prime to stream the show. Watched the whole first season in a day. Used CLOSED CAPTIONS just fine with streaming. No problems streaming either.  Masterpiece Theather always has well done entertainment.
0765334798|3.0|So, Redshirts, the new John Scalzi novel. Okay. Hmmm.<br /><br />Look, I'm a fan of Scalzi's fiction. His Old Man's War books (Old Man's War, The Ghost Brigades, The Last Colony, Zoe's Tale) are excellent SF with a good story, setting, and plenty of humour in the narrative that works well. Agent to the Stars was also a really good read, as was Fuzzy Nation. But Redshirts. Man, disappointing isn't even the word.<br /><br />The focus of Redshirts is the UUC Intrepid, and some newly arrived ensigns - our titicular Redshirts. The primary character is Andrew Dahl, and it's his experiences as he joins the Intrepid that we follow. There's something very wrong on this ship, and with his colleaugues miraculously disappearing at the right moments just as senior officers walk into the room, Dahl soon sets about to discover just what the hell is going on. It appears that there's a rather high percentage of crew deaths on away missions, and it is clear that certain people seem to be invulnerable to this misfortune....<br /><br />I'll start with the good: Redshirts is a funny novel, a quick read, and full of references to Star Trek. I enjoyed reading it, plowing through in barely a day, simply because it's a typical Scalzi novel and his prose is easy to read - it very much has the 'one more chapter' effect. I also very much liked the fact that Redshirts focused on the minor crew members on the Intrepid, not on the bridge crew and high-ranking officials as is the case with many novels, and TV shows.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />Despite how much I enjoyed reading Redshirts I got the feeling, on pretty much every page, that I'd seen this before. Scalzi pays homage to Star Trek, without a doubt, and manages to do so fairly well, but that's its biggest failing. It's too similar, too many plot elements have been seen before. Adding a tongue-in-cheek take on them is good because, lets face it, the source material is ripe for mocking. But Redshirts' main draw is also its biggest letdown.<br /><br />I had very high hopes for Redshirts, but ultimately it failed for me on pretty much all counts. It's a quick - and enjoyable - read, but doesn't do well when you look below the superficial elements. And the Codas - completely unneccesary, and it felt like they were there simply as padding because the main story was over so quickly.<br /><br />For a bit of mindless reading if you've a spare afternoon, then Redshirts should suit you fine, but if you're looking for something deeper just give it a miss. I can't say I recommend it, because I don't, I'd much rather direct you to his previous novels where you'll find some of the most enjoyable SF stories I've read.
B00CATSONE|4.0|impressive story of a great mans life very thought provoking and well researched recommended read a book of inspiration to all
1781162646|4.0|Joyland, Stephen King's new novel, is a strange beast. Coming from Hard Case Crime and being billed as 'a mystery, a horror story, and a bittersweet coming-of-age novel', it appears to have a little of everything. Perhaps that's the main problem with Joyland - what, exactly, is it? It's a question I asked many times during my reading, because the story I found within the pages was so much more than the billing Joyland received.<br /><br />In Joyland, King has written a novel that has many of his trademark story elements: coming-of-age, mystery, murder, and friends. It recognisable as a Stephen King story almost from the get-go, and the further in you read the more you realise just how King is able to weave a fairly simple story into something more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The narrative is told from the point of view of Devin Jones, remembering his summer working at Joyland during his time at university. While events are recounted, the benefit of hindsight allows some comments to creep in here and there, giving the story more emotion and grounding, letting you believe that this truly is an old man telling a tale of his youth. His memory of his first love, the fall-out of the relationship, and his reaction all play a large part in the story, a seemingly central point around which most of his thoughts revolve, at least to begin with. It's fortunate that King doesn't dwell to much on these aspects of Devin, instead focusing on the main attraction of Joyland: the park itself.<br /><br />Anyone that has been to an amusement park, or touring fair, will instantly recognise the vivid descriptions King employs in exploring Joyland. I suspect that even those that haven't will be hard pressed not to close their eyes and see the place come to life. The park is a character in itself, not simply a location in the novel to serve a purpose - although the purpose it serves certainly elevates its status. With a carny spirit and enjoyable characters, Joyland is every bit the perfect place for this story. The history of the murder plays a large part in the revelations we discover, but perhaps not as large as you may think.<br /><br />Joyland is an exceptional novel. Not only does King deliver an interesting murder-mystery that will keep you guessing, but does so without it obviously being one. It's often heartfelt and emotional, with relationships playing a large part throughout, and never is it a chore to read. Perhaps one of King's best novels in recent memory, Joyland is a slow-burner that will not let you down. Highly recommended.
B0030MM68O|4.0|tale of PTSD and the guy's in the unit of combat that noone gets to see or hear about,very intriguing
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|First, the shaky camera. Makes me dizzy. I'll give any movie a one star when I see a shaky, hand held film job. Then the sub-titles for the Russian speaking idiots; they go by so fast you cannot read them. This was some disappointing. Compared to the other Die Hards, this one is not even in the same league. Hey Bruce Willis, maybe you'd better check the writer, director and producer to make sure one or all has not gone to room temperature. This movie simply sucks. What a waste of $20.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|flick,not too shabby of a storyline,even though this particular storyline has been played out over and over again.Okay for the price!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Compared to waiting for my computer to load and put in the right city/ state, this is much faster. I'm using it on my Kindle Fire. One touch to turn it on it and one tap to pull it up. Love the hour by hour weather prediction. Can't get that on the news or the weather channel station.
B00640UICA|5.0|This game is a treasure. All the little characters are charming.  The sound effects make me laugh even after playing through all the levels.  It's intuitive, easy to learn, and runs glitch free.  Fun to play either by noodling around trial and error or by using some focused logic.  I found this game in the app store by chance and really love playing it.
B00CW665VI|4.0|This amusing story about a boy meets girl and falls in love for the first time is told with a unique twist. It's written in the first person using the hero's voice.<br /><br />Drew is an experienced player in the New York financial world when he meets Kate at a club. He is strictly a one night only kind of guy which he explains in hilarious detail as if he is talking to the reader. Kate brushes him off. He's bothered but consoles himself with a pair of red headed twins, only To discover on Monday morning that Kate is the new associate hired by his firm.<br /><br />I didn't really like Drew at first. He was cocky and jaded. I think that is what the author intended. As he falls more into Kate, you really start rooting for him. His internal dialogues are laugh out loud funny. I became invested in his happy ever after. The supporting cast of characters was a wonderful addition.<br /><br />There were many references to romantic movies. This book would make for a great chick flick..
B007OUINLC|5.0|If you are interested in the history of psychoanalysis, you will enjoy this.  Keira K is stunning and enjoyable as usual.  It is also a very good story and you can really relate to the characters.  Seeing Keira's character change and develop is intriguing -- starts as a patient and ends up as a psychiatrist. I always like movies with characters that adapt and develop.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Already read it once.  Re-reading again since the movie is coming soon. Luv the characters!  Can't wait for the movie, Book 2 Catching Fire!!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|This movie was highly rated by many and my expectations were high.  But the basic message and idea was not all that unusual and I could only relate moderately well with the characters. I am the kind of guy that can get very emotional while watching a really good movie.  This one just seemed a little trivial or common - small dramatic punch.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Just loved all of these books in this series...I sure hope that she comes up with the next one soon!
B00CATSONE|3.0|Although many of Tesla's accomplishments are lauded in this short book (less than an hour reading) it tells little of his life's story, which is what I wanted.  It much more an inspirational book designed to motivate someone, and the author makes a pitch to join his web page and begs for positive feedback in the end of the book.  I was really looking more for the big story of the life of a man that did so much and got so little recognition.  Most people today still do not know what he did for the world...
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I absolutely love JFK and was really glad to see a new viewpoint on it. Even if it is from Stephen King...lol I always like reading his novels I just hate that it takes me the first 10 or so chapters to get into it. :)
B0063GORYU|4.0|I am getting pretty good at winning the single deck games - maybe I better try some more difficult double decks deals.  But even though it's a free game, it is fun to play and expandable enough to keep your interest.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is great and fun. its not time consuming or needing alot of friends to build and have to send materials to build or upgrade buildings, you just need game money. try it out
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I still do not like then on-screen typing on the Kindle Fire, but I also use this on my desktop at work and my laptop at home, and plan to get a keyboard to use with the Kindle.  I like this much better than Open Office, and it has some features that even MS Office does not that I wish it did.  The Kindle Fire HD version takes some learning to use, but for what you get for what it costs, this is one of my favorite apps!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the most amazing one out of the series. I love how it gives the background details of Christian. Now I can fully understand what was going through his mind. Hopefully, the author will continue to write more books, but put it as Christians point of view instead of Ana's.
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|No I'm not - and it is frustrating to play this game when you bridges always fail - but it&#34;s kind of fun watching cars and trucks take the dive... The tutorial is just OK - and it's not hard to play - but it is hard to get too far, even with modern matrials, since thee are no hints and the connection dots don't always line up exactly. Playing on a touch screen is not fun. Just when you think it almost works, then change one thing an see ten things disappear - too frustrating.  I DELETED IT!
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|This is a very elegant design, that plays well up to four players and travels better than just about any other game I have. Definitely a must for everyone.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Really one of Evanovich`s best so far.  I have read all of her Stephanie Plum books from 1-8 and each one seems better than the last. I will continue to read the rest of the series, with relish!
B00001MXXH|5.0|Just as great as the first time I watched it!  It is an iconic movie for our generation!  Love it!
B00008EY9G|5.0|What a great movie. Such a twist at the end. The actors were very good and the plot was terrific.
159562015X|3.0|This book nailed me on the head. The quiz was quick and the details at the end were easy to read and review.
1400069807|5.0|No saccharine descriptions or spicy language here. By telling us stories about the people at the center, he makes his description of the complicated and secretive food industry digestible.
B001EZ2T7W|3.0|I've seen the TV show, nothing really more espcetacular than that...the quality doesn't not look close to HD at all,
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|he loved it and i did too because it was free my son is 7 at first i had to help hime but afterwards he was great and didnt wanna share lol thumbs up
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love having Pinterest on my Kindle I didn't 5 star rate it because there are things that could be a little better. You can't directly pin anything from the web, you go to the pin, but then when you want to return, you get sent back farther than you'd want and need to navigate back to where you want to be. But overall a fun app.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is the greatest game ever. I always enjoy games like this one thank you so much for this game.
B004EPZ0BG|3.0|I bought a used copy of this movie, so was not expecting it to be perfect, the movie skipped in one small part but something was obviously spilled on the DVD, it almost got stuck in the DVD player. I will probably not buy from this seller again.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Awesome challenging game. Beat the 60 sec and the game is on.  love this game. Thw best time game ever. :-)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Excellent, moving book. Although not as good, in my opinion, as A Thousand Splendid Suns, Hosseini weaves a story of love, questions, hope, and loss across multiple decades. He uses multiple viewpoints and styles in telling the story, switching from a third-person account to a letter to a first-person account to a magazine interview. Every chapter tells the story from a different character's view point and Hosseini masterfully weaves them all together.<br /><br />However, the style does lend to what feels like a lot of rambling and unneeded details because of all the different settings and characters he tries to develop. It often feels like he gets sidetracked from the main story. But I think that might be the point: it's not just \\"one story.\\"<br /><br />Through the multiple accounts and viewpoints, Hosseini is really telling a bigger story--a story about life and how seemingly inconsequential decisions (and selfish ones too) rip at the core of our identity and affect other people in ways we could not anticipate. It's a bigger story about how love and commitment doesn't always end up with a fairy tale ending. Sometimes life really sucks, but it's in those moments that, if we are willing to look deeper, we'll find out who we really are in a deeper way. Some questions don't have answers, but because we are not an island in the universe how we live in the face of these questions effects other people in significant ways.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|Another 5 star transaction.  Found on Amazon at a great price.  Seller shipped the item promptly.  Item was received just as described.  Will definitely buy from again.<br />Even though this is an older movie....a great item to add to your collection as it is a classic Whitney Houston movie....great music and storyline! Thank you.

B001BN1ZHW|5.0|SweeneyTodd was film of energy depth you say take two  it did me or is it bluray i have found this medium far more enlightening than just dvd which because of its limitations lends itself having the depth of the story lost  into obscurity the film bodes well the people draw from the strength of the piece not the other way around this is a film that hangs out a thread of decency but blink and that friend will have burton knew this way before anybody else even saw it coming so watch it again then you to will see why it takes two
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|FREQUENT UP-GRADES are needed.  I have 33,564 coins. I've completed every puzzle and upgraded all prizes to tier 9 except for Bears and Dice. I need more Dozer Dollars but I Don't want to buy any. Every up grade costs 10 dozer dollars.  The game is starting to get boring, it needs more puzzles and rewards for all those SILVER coins which I still Don't understand why we get them.  I probably have just as many SILVER coins as I do gold.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I know I don't usually review movies, but sometimes you just gotta get the word out there! This is officially my new favorite!!! I just finished it and I haven't stopped crying, have you ever tried to type through tears? It's a pain in the behind! Yet here I am shouting from the proverbial rooftops that this is the best rendition of this story I have ever seen. I am not going to lie and say I've ever read the book, I don't need to seem smarter than I am. The book was too old and slow for me to even really start. The musical took full advantage of the slow crawl of the story and filled it with beauty and ugliness and imperfection that had me riveted from beginning to end. The cast sang their lines with no dub over, that is apparent in the occasional pitch issues and emotion that ripped my heart out and stomped on it a few times before shoving it back in my chest and sneering \\"Try it out now, witch.\\" Really, Russel Crow? All the crap I've talked about how once he aged past his good looks he was destined to wait tables? Open mouth, insert foot Seanna! His Inspector Javer reduced me to tears with the tragic black and white view of the world and not being able to move past it. Everyone was wonderful, but I need to give a shout out to Sascha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter! They made this movie in a lot of ways, I don't think I could have appreciated the drama without their comedy relief. They are pure evil, but you can't help but love them. My 16 year old daughter looked at me at one point and said \\"Is it weird that I think he's really hot?\\" Lol! I was feeling a little weird myself until she said something! Wonderful movie. Period.
B008602KQI|4.0|I never read the books but gave the movie a try cause of it's cool premise. It's a great movie that gets you hyped up for the sequels, some things i didn't like were just minor complaints like how they censor the deaths, or how Peeta didn't do that much. People expecting an action-packed movie will also be disappointed. Bottom line is the hunger games is a cool movie that definitely is a much watch as long as you appreciate for what it is. Can't wait to see the sequels!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Genre: Psychological Thriller<br />Sex: :( **** what was there was just wrong.<br /><br />Sometimes there are books that affect me in a negative way. I am horrible to live with because of my foul mood while getting through the story. I am extra cuddly and almost needy with my husband (which drives him crazy) and my happiness is squashed for the entire duration of the book, I become a negative and broody person. This is a book that brought it all out. At the same time. I even had sad and depressing dreams in the three/four nights I was reading this. I rated this book a three because obviously to affect me this deeply it was well written and a good story, but as I've stated several times, I read to escape reality not get beaten over the head with ugliness. That is the best way to explain this book. Ugly.<br /><br />The sex (which was a surprise since I didn't think there was any) was just plain wrong. Wrong men, wrong reason, wrong time, wrong place, and wrong freaking mentality. I disliked the girl telling the story from beginning to end, she was weak and spineless and handicapped mentally and kinda stupid and wrong in her own right in too many ways to count. Too needy, too damaged, too oblivious, too willing to party with thirteen year olds (she's 32), and too caught up on judging people. I am going to be searching for a funny, feel good book to read next so I can recover from this downer.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for someone who wants a psychological thriller, I was surprised by the end. It was written well and (to be fair) it was a good story that twisted and turned than smacked you upside the head in a matter of fact tone of voice that makes you blink a couple of times before you register the ugliness and brutality of the outcome. Simply put, it's just not my thing. That certainly doesn't make it bad, it was actually really good. Just not for me.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I have never been let down by the Keys, I have several albums and they are all great blues. I hope the Black Keys will come to the Blues Fest in Billings Montana some day. It would to this town some justice. I love this band.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The latest Crossfire novel was as delicious as the the ones before.  I can not wait for more of Gideon and Eva!!!
B009SQOGZ2|4.0|I received this movie for my birthday, it took me a little bit of time to actually watch it. But I really like it, i thought it would be a cute kids movie, ya, ok. But once I watched it I realized that even though it had young themes, like school bullying, it also had themes that could relate to adults as well. I would definitely recommend it to someone else and watch it again.
B004MNVKVO|1.0|FYI:  I give this album, that I have had for 30 years, a 5 star rating, but this is a review on the new Blu-ray disc's audio and video quality.<br /><br />I hate to be the wet blanket, but this was a terrible attempt to introduce a classic album to Blu-ray. I am a big Rush fan and am rooting for the Blu-ray format, but I have to be honest here.<br />First of all the video, pictures, and menu are all poor quality. I understand the video clips and pictures back then were inferior compared to now, but the menu, at least, should have looked a lot better. The font from the lyrics is way too small and blurry. It came across as a high school student's video project. I realize this is more of a music Blu-ray, but the visuals are embarrassing.<br /><br />I was willing to overlook the visuals for this Blu-ray if the sonic quality, of the 5.1 mix, was exceptional. Unfortunately it was not to be. Of the three 96/24 mixes I preferred the PCM 2.0. I didn't like either of the 5.1 mixes, but thought the PCM 5.1 was better than the DTS. Both of them had way too much boomy bass, and the surround effects sounded gimmicky, like a cheap ploy to get everyone hooked on the 5.1 mix. Both mixes are heavy handed and fail to complement the overall sonic balance of the original recording. I found a big difference between the PCM 5.1 and the DTS 5.1. The DTS version is not as smooth and has much more of an edgy midrange, which works well for dialogue in movies, but not music. The PCM 2.0, with the re-master, did bring out more resolution in the high end and cleaned up the mid and low frequencies. The problem is that the higher resolution seems to change the balance of the mix levels. The midrange was a bit overcooked and Lee's vocals came across as a little too forward. I am unsure if it was remixed when they re-mastered on the 2.0, but if they did, they shouldn't have. If they didn't they should have. I see a future for 96/24 and 192/24, but it has to be done right. The mixing engineers need to adjust levels differently when they mix for higher resolution. I think they will have to transition much like they did when going from LP's to CD's. It took a few years to get it right, but they eventually got it.<br /><br />Judging on this Blu-ray, I think reintroducing classic albums for 5.1 will be a tough sell, especially to audiophiles, who would be the only ones willing to pony up the $25.00 for an album they already have. Music Blu-ray's may have a chance, if the album is recorded for the 5.1 format, and is mixed right. But in the end, I think it is dead in the water without a concert type video accompanying the audio tracks.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I love this so much.  It does just what it is supposed to do.  The color is bright and cheerful.  Anyone who is on the fence about buying this case will not be disappointed.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Ok...you have seen the Hangover Part 1, Part 2 is a must see...can't wait to get Part 3 HA-larious, lol.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I am more of a science fiction guy myself, but I was recommended this book by my sister. I figured I'd check it out seeing that I recently finished my last book and was searching for my next read. It was nice at first...a nice casual read. Then before I knew it, I was hooked. I finished the book within a week; which is saying something for me for being a slow reader and having two jobs.<br />One thing that was hard for at first was that it bounces around, going from present to past and back to present and back again. However, Morgenatern does an amazing job at keeping you captivated and a lot of times in suspense wondering what will happen next. If you get a chance, I would definitely recommend this book.
B00177YA1K|4.0|This, I believe, is the digital version(through Amazon Prime, I think) of the movie that I never saw so I can't really comment on this. Sorry.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|i like this just fine with the exception that i can't figue out how to get out of app without starting over each time.
B001FB55L2|5.0|WOW!!! This is a very good movie and very touching and true with everything that has happened in the lives of Military Soldiers.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Fun game to play, the controls aren't that great but the multiplayer is good and so are the graphics. It can be aggravating to save up enough credits to buy new weapons and stuff.
B002AF4Y9G|4.0|I was told this is a MUST watch movie...I like and own almost all of the movies that Quentin Tarantino did or involved in. I watched it twice...the first time I was kinda tired and I was completely lost/disappointed but on the 2nd viewing of this movie it all made sense to me...I like it, it was good. If you like QT this IS a must watch movie.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Received the product much sooner than expected and was very pleased with that.<br />Was charged with customs/tax and was not prepared for that.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Now if you like the first one you have to like the remaining movies. I purchased this for my future Family, all the previous installments as well, and my Mother...my Mother out of all people was stuck on the couch with me and was like a little kid...if SHE loved them I know EVERYBODY will love this and the other installments.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Ended a bit suddenly but otherwise great and enjoyable. Professional narration is very nice and even gives voices to their own character.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Ok...from the previews of this movie it was NOT what I thought it would be. Please DON'T get me wrong, it was a good movie even though it was NOT what I was expecting. I thought there would be lots of flying footage but...sorry I am not going to be that guy who ruins the movie for others. Parents and I were expecting something else but man...they were glued to the screen as was I. Denzel Washington rocks!!!

B009NY43NY|4.0|After reading so many negative reviews, I was somewhat surprised that I enjoyed it so much.  Although the writing lacked a certain \\"zing\\" that many of the early books had, I think that some logical conclusions to relationships and character development were presented here.  Sookie was never very comfortable in the world of the vampires, despite her love for some and friendship with a few.  The idea that she could ever happy after with Eric or Bill would have required a major out of character adjustment for HER, our heroine.  Sookie has always loved her quiet times--her grandma's house, cooking, her friends, sitting in the sunshine.  She didn't have the making of a vampire.  And Sam was very much a part of the world that Sookie felt comfortable in--so I'm quite content with that resolution.  As for Eric being out of character---nope.  I think that he was very much in vamp character.  He did care about Sookie, quite a lot, and much of it was demonstrated in the arrangements he made for her.  But \\"love\\" as they knew it wasn't going to last..he knew it and so did Sookie.  I enjoyed the visits from old characters, even if brief.  I liked that they stood up for Sookie when she needed it.  Maybe I'm just getting old...but I enjoy resolutions where characters find love and friendship--then go off and live their lives.  In this ending, it was the villains' own prejudices and flaws, Sookie's smarts and a caring group of honky tonk folks who saved the day. Sookie remains in her sunny world of sweet iced tea and tasty tomatoes, a nice garden and comfortable fresh sheets! I'm satisfied, and thanks to Ms. Harris for a good read all these years.  By the way, I regard the \\"True Blood\\" series as a totally different universe with different characters than appear in the books!  I watch it, but it ain't the same as the books---so let's no overlap our feelings on this!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This simple game is  a fun way to relieve a stressful day!The Kindle is a joy to own!!!We just need more hours in the day for fun things.
B002NN5F7A|1.0|The ridiculous amount of foul language made the scenes unrealistic.  Yes, the stress level would be extremely high because the salesmen were in a pressure cooker atmosphere to produce sales in a system stacked against them.  However, the tremendous acting was overshadowed by the limited vocabularies of otherwise very bright men.  Frankly, the language made the whole movie really boring.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|The Twilight saga is very good and find movies with great quality and very cheap is excellent, I recommend this product

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is probably my favorite game I have on my kindle. My highest score is only<br />8,000,000+ and I do not get to play that often. I sure hope they come out with a<br />Temple Run 3.

B005ILYW1E|4.0|A hard nosed cop played by Jason Statham, and his surprisingly tough partner go after a serial killer.  His partner gets a lot of grief over his preferences in lovers. Unfortunately for them the killers favorite target is police officers.  Their main suspect is wiley, clever, and far to smug for any tough cop to endure.  Naturally the cops can't get any good evidence and he is let go after Statham brings him in.  Him and his partner finally decide enough is enough after the victim count hits around seven.  If you enjoy good cop movies you will more than likely enjoy this one.  Great rental price and decent purchase price on it right now. I saw this before some time ago and just I re-watched it as rental since the price was ninety-nine cents. This is one I can see going back and watching from time to time.  Good price on Blu-ray too so I got it.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B00CL6HGIK Broken City]], [[ASIN:B005LAIILM Parker]], and [[ASIN:B000I9VZEI The Transporter]].<br /><br />CA Luster

B0016YBFZ8|3.0|The Movie stars out with Ray Layotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci about to open up the trunk to find out about the noise coming from the trunk with these three guys thinking they killed the guy from the bar and when they opened the trunk and seen he was still alive he was stabbed and shot then buried in a un named plot of land then you hear Ray Laotta tell the screen he always wanted to be a Gangster. then he tells his story spanning 1955 showing a young Henry Hill starting out in the business to the 80's when he went into Witness Protection with Karen Hill and his two daughters. I found it less gory than Donnie Brasco but the ideal is the same with mobsters their misses and Girl friends
0385341008|4.0|This is a very interesting book due to format and historial facts that blend with the personal stories of the people during W.W.!!<br /><br />I have recommended it to several of my friends who also enjoyed it and thought it was very worth while.I do think it appeals more<br /><br /> to the more mature reader, older than 30, but I could be wrong and still suggest it to young adults as a good read.

B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Duplo is always a great gift for my nieces and nephews. We have duplo that's more than 20 years old. It never wears out, nor does our interest in playing with it. We bring it out whenever we have kids over, now that ours are grown.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|The book was good, with all the expected mayhem going on in Gideon and Eva&#34;s lives. It left me a bit deflated where it left off, thought it could finished on a higher suspense than where it did. Thinking it was a trilogy, it was a little disappointing not to have an end, I hope Sylvia Day does not drag the next novel out too much as we are starting to rehash over the same wordings, the same feelings. I may be sounding a bit down after reading this book but it REALLY is a good follow up to the series. Just thought it went through the same dramas a bit too much, well worth reading
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I enjoyed playing the game, as did my two daughters (5 and 6). My one complaint is the number of ads, which seem excessive.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|my family loves this game it is so fun after I tried the game I couldn't put it down you should get it
B009YP9L7U|1.0|The book was lame. Didn't even finish it. Read the first four chapters and I couldn't get into it. It just seems to bounce around alot. And I dont mean the fact that it was bouncing from present to what happened when they met either. Usually a really good book can keep me captivated, but this one? Not ecen worth the free book.
159562015X|4.0|I really enjoyed taking the online quiz portion of this book.  I found it immensely helpful in highlighting my personality strengths in order to choose a fulfilling and successful career for myself.  My sister, who is a human resource guru, recommends and even buys this book for her employees on a regular basis as a way to help them develop themselves and now I see why!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Love the tv show. I could watch it over and over again. Which I do. I can never get tired of this cartoon. Mostly because I'm just as sarcastic as Daria. :)<br /><br />But what really sucks is that none of the songs, were originally from the show. In the dvd, it was changed, except for when Mystic Spiral sings, the opening theme music. But I could live with it.

So far I have not been disappointed by this writer.<br />This  particular book hit home with me. I lived in North Carolina and was married to a very controlling, verbal and physical abusive marriage. I finally got the courage to leave and I am divorced now back in Virginia. All I can say is I have the most respect for anyone that can get themselves out of that situation.

B008OHV4PG|4.0|Director Jonathan Demme teams up again with Neil Young and provides another combo documentary/concert film.  As a long time Young fan, I'm always interested in his musical direction and his interests in the fidelity of recorded sound.  Here he returns to his hometown in northern Ontario as he prepares for a two night gig at Toronto's Massey Hall. Young rents a '56 Ford and follows his brother in a Cadillac making pit stops along memory lane.  Neil tells us events in his life growing up all of which is pretty normal stuff.  No horror tales in his background.<br /><br />When the film takes us to the concert venue, Young walks on stage alone, but for his guitar and harmonica, says nothing to the audience and starts playing.  He mixes up old songs from the late `60's and brings them to life in a new way.  He sources his more recent (2010) material as well, providing a nice mix.  Playing alone I was interested in seeing Young thumb that top, thick bass string while still coaxing the melody out of the lower ones.  I'm no guitar player but you don't see that too often.  My subs were awake and moving.<br /><br />Demme and Young get a bit carried away with some of the camera tricks, the most offensive being a small camera mounted on the mic stand.  This gives us a good view of Neils throat, teeth and nose hair.  We even get a bit of spittle on the camera which can be enjoyed through much of the concert.  Don't get me wrong, the music is great and Young clearly has deep affection for his roots.<br /><br />This Blu ray disc looks pretty good, but is fairly routine for the technology.  Blacks are deep during the concert footage and the visuals feature excellent texture and clarity.  Notice Neil's tattered straw hat.  The \\"road\\" footage is more limiting given the home movie style of shooting.  The transfer comes in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and, as hinted at above, is damn fine.  At least the concert portion is.  Again, the stroll through memory lane is less involving.  Here are the concert selections:<br />1.  Peaceful Valley Boulevard<br />2.  Ohio<br />3.  Down by the River<br />4.  Sign of Love<br />5.  Rumbling<br />6.  Love and War<br />7.  Leia<br />8.  After the Gold Rush<br />9.  I Believe in You<br />10.  My, My, Hey, Hey (Out of the Blue)<br />11.  You Never Call<br />12.  Hitchhiker<br />13.  Walk With Me<br /><br />Extras include a couple interviews with Young and Demme, a short \\"making of\\" doc, a trailer and an assortment of Sony previews.rough memory lane is less involving.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Cast well chosen, acting is excellant, and story is very well written. Most similar stories are 90 % the family and 10 % the household staff. This is more like 50 - 50 and I think really adds to the character development.
B007TKT2SK|3.0|I only used it a few times. I was looking for a calculator and this popped up, was a mistaken download but over all it is what it is. I did find a calculator which is what I was originally looking for.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Game wants money for each new object. Needs graphic enhanced cinematic view to make the game worth it. Still worth playing needs more though.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Yeah, these are the altered versions on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />But unless you're some huge Star Wars nerd who considers \\"The Force\\" to be a religion and routinely goes to Star Wars conventions and dresses up like Darth Vader...who cares?<br /><br />Seriously<br /><br />Personally, I couldn't care less if Greedo shoots first, Jabba has received a CGI makeover, or Hayden Christiansen appears for all of 3 seconds replacing the original actor as the ghost of Anakin at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\".<br /><br />Do these few little minute details drastically change these films that all border on nearly 3 hours long?<br /><br />No, they really don't.<br /><br />If you want to skip this blu-ray release which features drastically upgraded audio and visual presentation in favor of your old VHS tapes just because they aren't EXACTLY the way these films were originally released...then suit yourself.<br /><br />If you want to wait another 10+ years for George Lucas to kick the bucket so you can get the original, unaltered versions with supreme quality...then have at it.<br /><br />Me? I'm not some kind of obsessive Star Wars purist. I'm just a guy who enjoys the original trilogy. And the subtle changes that have been made haven't detracted from my enjoyment of the films at all, really.<br /><br />5/5

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|But it still kept you reading.  Loved the first two books and will read the fourth because the story still leaves you wanting more.
B005EI86JU|3.0|I found this digital copy difficult to navigate between chapters.  Not really a fan of it this particular digital print.  I would prefer to have a hard copy of this publication as it would be much easier to bookmark sections I want to remember and/or try to apply as I am shooting pictures.

B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Good characters, lovely editing, good story.  Gritty details about what mental illness does to a family. Believable choices by characters, but the process of change by Pat(Cooper) was so subtle as to be non existent, and made the ending feel like it belonged in a different movie. Tacking on a \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" ending did not do justice to to the work done earlier in the movie.  Sadly, the love of a difficult woman can't cure bipolar disorder. Felt like a roller coaster that built up and built up and the ending finale was simply coasting into the off-loading deck.
0439321603|5.0|The book is awesome!!! My son loves it!!! It completes his collection!!<br />We did not even know this book existed!!!
B004856SQ8|5.0|if you forget that this was a tv series and a pretty lame one at that, the characters are engaging and the actors used in this version do a great job capturing the series essence. Liam Neeson shines as always. Except for the final battle in L.A. Harbor, where I worked for over 30 years the action is great
193700788X|5.0|I LOVE IT!!! DIDN'T KNow THIS WAS EVEN OUT!!! I HAVE ALREADY ORDERED THE LAST ONE DUE OUT IN THE FALL!!!
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Perhlman was made for this role. the special effects are excellent and the acting is lively ,,,,,the is a lot of humor and pathos in this film
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book!  Lots of emotions! It's a must read book! Make sure to read the second book! :)
B005TBN3EU|1.0|The original Hangover, as wild as it was, didn't cross the lines that this sequel did.  Definitely not my cup of tea.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best if you go on iPhone or iPad it is the best game ever it is better then temple run 2. Or angry gran
B005UG53NS|5.0|Like Part 1 - has dark elements to it, but it's very faithful to the book, and helps to tie the whole series up.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|An opened mind show with twist and turns, keeping you on the edge of your feet. I recommend this show to all of love mysteries and science.
B004MPEFBE|5.0|Each part of the series is a little darker - definitely not for kids under 10, but it is a great movie to watch from the story line to the visual effects. Very tight, very well done.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Worth the watch. A lot of info for the person that doesn't know how or where their food is produced. The corporate side is fascinating and scary.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|Loved his development of characters but have become depressed with the lack of conclusion to his novels.  This one especially seem to leave the reader hanging.  Are the sirens coming to get them or to defeat the enemy?  Who can tell
B005COO1X6|1.0|Very disappointed..love Stephen Kings writing but come on,a car that eats people??? This story was too stupid to be scary.
B002WTX7XO|4.0|It wasn't the BEST movie you could make on the subject...but we enjoyed it (me and my 13yr old daughter) and we're big fans of apocalyptic movies like this.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Takes very long to load just at first with my Kindle Fire. Then the fun begins. Don't be afraid to try if you are a hidden object fan.
B0057F869U|3.0|I feel like with the 2 hours they had, they could have covered more of the storyline according to the book. IMHO the 1996 blows this one away. Also Rochester needed a bit more ugly, and the lunatic needed a bit more crazy
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever but, I can't get 0.7.1!!!!!!<br />Overall, best game ever, you can build whatever comes into your mind and you can craft in survival and survive against evil mobs like a creeper, zombie, spider, and skeleton.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My friends all have the v0.7.0 version on their tablets. I have a kindle fire and the update won't work. I feel really left out and want my kindle to update update please for 5 stars
B0097BY3K6|5.0|I discovered David Garrett about 3 yrs ago. His music is so cool and uplifting, I find him fascinating to watch on his DVD. I also watch his Utube shows, can't get enough of him. This latest CD continues his genius with the violin and the fact that he is easy on the eyes is an extra plus.  Can't wait for his next CD.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|I like this album better than the last one. I do like the last album but this one is a lot better to me. The songs have more character and killer guitar licks
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Great game it has Mario rip off but it's one of the best Mario rip offs yet amazing get it!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I would recommend Downton Abbey to anyone who enjoys good drama, English catch phrases and beautiful castles. This drama is set in the beautiful English countryside and encompasses the drama of the classes in the early 1900's.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I downloaded it a while ago and it was great! But then my kindle started messing up, like for example, I couldn't go on the internet,go on games, and it basically blocked everything as soon as I uninstalled it, everything got right back to normal. Overall, not satisfied with this app.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I don't normally read this kind of story. When I first started reading it I told myself I would not have ordered it had i known it was vampires, werewolves and the like but figured since I had it I may as well read it and it was riviting. I am ready for the next in the series.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|Of course this is a wonderful movie.  Very intense and more so because it is based on a true story.  The music is beautiful in the movie too.
B004U52VPS|4.0|Bought for 11 year old son Christmas present. Popular idea for this age group. Find that takes a while to set up so have adapted game. Lots of fun.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Reminded me of basic training with the Women's Army Corps. I'm a big fan of Vincent D'onofrio from Law and Order Criminal Intent, and wanted to see him in other roles.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is way better than the computer edition with newer units.  i would really recomend this  really worth the money
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Mr Baldacci writes in a very captivating style. This book is a great example of his work. The primary focus is on the action and secondly on the purpose, protecting people from deliberate harm. If you are looking for an action based novel, this is worth the time and effort. If you want accuracy and believable circumstances then this will disappoint.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game I play it all the time and I love it and finally wow just get it and play it
B0055S348W|5.0|I have the Photosmart 7520, which is not listed as one of the compatible printers.  I use Cloudprint for my smartphone, but it wasn't working for my kindle fire.  Printershare was easy to install.  I needed to download a driver, but the app prompted me - I did not have to research this myself.  Printing is very fast.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Google play is much much much better than Amazon.  Minecraft`s updates are always out the day they say on Google. I HATE the Amazon Appstore so much now I deleted it from my phone the second I heard that Google had minecraft updated.  Listen Amazon: hundreds of kindle owners, ( including me ) are pissed because of your slow poke nonsense. It's time to step it up you lousy jerks.
B00AK57N00|1.0|Unable to play because I don't have an active Internet connection...yet i just downloaded the game. Either android 4.2 is the worst android version or this game won't run on my nexus 4
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|It's good but needs work like to go 2 New servers. But other then that.it's awesome I love medic I love it when we can play.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Fabulous album-listen to this CD  as often as possible-love Rod Stewart- young and old -his voice has not changed one bit-
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I would definitely recommend it.  Khaled  Hosseini is a great writer!  He uses a very different and interesting way of writing by putting many perspectives of lives in Afghanistan to create one story.  Overall I loved it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|other than the unappealing guy in the car :) it is a good game, the only thing I don't like is that you always flip over...other than that it is great
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Mara is very convincing as a depressed wife of Tatum, who destroyed their wealthy lifestyle and caused her miscarriage after  his arrest for insider trading.  After his release from a four year prison term, he returns to a suicidal and drug-addled wife.  Law enters as her psychiatrist trying to find the right chemical cocktail to fix what ails her.  Nothing works and he consults with Zeta-Jones, her former psychiatrist, who is not particularly empathetic or helpful. Suddenly Mara, in a sleepwalking fog-a side effect of her latest drug, Ablixa-stabs and kills Tatum.  She gets off the murder charge on an insanity plea due to the drug and has to do a stint in a psych ward, where she begins to improve dramatically.  Law's professional and personal life go to hell as he is blamed for prescribing it. He detects  discrepancies in Mara's statements and behavior, however, and begins to smell a rat.  As he works to exonerate himself, he must step outside legal and professional boundaries and , in doing so, appears somewhat unhinged himself.<br /><br />This film could have been so much better.  The plot is interesting and fairly intricate enough to draw you in.  I think the casting was the issue.  First, if you are a Tatum fan, he has nothing to do here.  He barely appears and is dead early on. A little more development of Mara and Tatums's relationship might have been helpful. There is a flashback that attempts to do this but it is not fleshed out.  Rooney Mara is excellent at developing her character from severely depressed to calculating.  Jude Law does a good job of keeping you on the fence about just who he is.  Is he a good guy?  Is he a competent doctor or a little careless and money-grabbing? Perhaps he is just a little attracted to Rooney, the desperate little bird?  It bothered me that Law and his wife had no chemistry and she walked at the first bump in the road.  However, Zeta-Jones was the real problem for me.  She was so brittle and so plastic from the beginning,not to mention more gorgeous than any doctor you've ever seen, it was a \\"tell\\"....like a clue in a card game.  I suspected her immediately and therefore saw early on where the plot was going.  If her character had been played as an earth mother type who had great insight,  concern, and caring for her former patient, the plot twists would have been less exposed.  I think the goal in this plot is to keep you thinking Law's character is flawed on several levels, and believing Mara's character is a victim of the medical community.  Zeta-Jones waves a big red flag that says \\"hey, I'm in on the plot twist\\".  Finally, the trap Law sets for Mara is satisfying but the ending itself seemed emotionally vacant.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Great series! Great actors and actresses! Looking forward to the continuation of the series (i.e. possible 7 back in Tokyo??).
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Complex, character driven, surreal, grounded. A fantastic fantasy epic with tension and drama enough to make your head spin. Pick it up and you won't wanna put it down!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I played this game with my six year old son. It was a lot of fun. Challenging at times. We are hoping for more in the future.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Christian and Ana: the kinky love story of our time.  Book 3; FSF brings the trilogy full circle - answers all the questions and fills in all the blanks.  Heavy on the sex and light on adventure and intrigue.  Guess it just wasn't that kind of book although I kept hoping for a little more excitement outside of the red playroom.  If you read the first two, you might as well read this one - for closure.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I really wish it had more graphics an brighter colors. It could be bigger too. I do play it still though.
B008ZTW7OU|3.0|Bluesy retro rock that would have fit in on the Dazed and Confused soundtrack. Has a few great songs and the rest is decent filler.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Best workout, you will sweat like crazy and see results within a few days. Can't beat the price. Buy it today! You won't be sorry.
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|I have not read the book so I don't know how well the movie keeps with the book but this movie is a let down.  It was hyped to be a super-natural world like Twilight but this movie is boring.  The teenage angst is not done very well.  The witch the story is about only does magic a few times, none of the witches do much magic.  The country (not southern) in this movie gets old quick.  The young actors aren't great but neither are the more experienced actors in this movie and I know Jeremy Irons is an excellent actor so something went wrong.  Not much character development, plot was interesting but not properly exploited.  I doubt I would even watch it again for free.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|All great actors and characters.  There were some slow parts in the movie.  I rarely watch a movie more than once, but rated it better than average because I would watch it again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its ok. I like how it looks so real.the good part is its totally free and its pretty easy to play.
B008OOYALE|3.0|My grand-daughter and I enjoy the game but have problems with being thrown off line when we try to visit  others islands which is part of the fun. Its also frustrating to breed the same dragons over and over. When you put certain colors of dragons together you may get dragons of a totally different color. That is frustrating. I understand making it more difficult to breed the more expensive dragons but you should be able to without having to buy them.  Overall I love the game just needs some tweaking.
B008602KQI|4.0|I have read the book and expected the movie to highlight the violence from the story.  i was  pleasantly surprised to find that the movie really highlighted many of the better parts of the book.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Third time I've read it and it's every bit as good as the first time. The plump comfort of a story, the soothing, rocking safety of a lie.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this game and I get so wrapped up in it that time flies! Great game that gets harder as you play more levels.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Marson is a great story teller and incredibly clever. His sense of humor and personal insight make you feel as though you are having the most entertaining conversation of your life. I hope he writes another. I will be the first to get it. You will not be disappointed. Especially if your a true fan of his.
0062502174|4.0|This book was suggested by a friend. I enjoyed reading it and for those who are not keen on reading long novels this one is short and to the point. Before reading this I finished David Copperfield, The Alchemist was a much needed change of pace and breath of fresh air.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This CD is in the style of Taylor Swift's original music. Several songs on the album are great and memorable. If you like Taylor Swift, you should buy this CD.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love love it it os awesome and tots cool and you should get it... NOW so get it today
B003WTE886|5.0|If you love Taylor Swift music, you should own this CD. She has some great songs on this album, check them out!
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|I have all the other Dr.pandas and this one looks fun and awesome game to play and show to my cousins and my freinds.
1596680180|5.0|I chose this book because it presents a great presentation, and a varied collection of techniques and illustrations about the art of braiding strings and tissues, and other materials. I believe that those interested in the subject will have an excellent opportunity to expand their knowledge. I recommend this book to everyone and a great use!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazon is really late getting out updates. If you are going to get this app, which is an awesome app, buy it from Google Play, so you do not miss out on awesome updates.
087033039X|5.0|The book is very nice and has an excellent structure, based on stories and illustrations that show the art of leather work in their hearts. I recommend to anyone interested!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|The &#34;frustration free&#34; packaging is a farily non-descript cardboard box - none of that hermetically-sealed plastic that you have to destroy to open.  It's certainly not the packaging that you'd see at your local Best Buy, so if that's important to you, then look elsewhere.  Personally, I'm only going to toss the packaging in the trash anyway, so I don't care what packing it came in.<br /><br />If you're looking for a pocketable, hard case that will protect your headset investment and keep its charge &#34;topped off&#34;, then this case is ideal.<br /><br />I like that it uses red and blue indicator lights that are easy to tell apart if you're red-green color blind like I am.  Normally, bi-color red/green LEDs drive me batty because I can't tell which color it is, so I don't know what it's representing.  Not a problem with this case, so that's a huge plus for me.<br /><br />It's also nice being able to carry the thing in your pocket without fear of squishing your headset and knowing that the headset will be raring to go when you pull it out.
B0063IH60K|4.0|you can choose from several options.  Much better for those of us who aren't good at shuffling cards and no mess to clean up.
B005LJITS0|3.0|It's a cute movie.  Great for kids...not too scary, got a good theme (courage is not the absence of fear, but doing something in spite of your fear).  Puff pastry for adults - light, crispy but absolutely no substance.  A good no-brainer for when you want to veg out.
B0006AAS5G|1.0|If I were a small child it would have fit perfectly! Should have been listed as a unisex model. Really!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great book by Hosseini.  I am still in the process of reading it and cannot wait to get back to the book.  This author weaves a great story.  At times it is hard to read but we need to know how lucky we are to live in this country of freedom.
B00A81MV3U|2.0|There were no other films that year worthy of notice? If it wasn't for the relentless, in your face, screaming, crying, and general rage this film would have no personality at all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this app cause I liked horse's. I lose track of time because this is such a fun app.if y'all like horse care an fun get this app.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It lets me download almost any youtube video, in video form, or mp3. Its the only youtube download app that works well that i have found, and its free!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I didn't know who she was until after a saw a few of her U-tube vedio.  After that I knew I just had to have the cd.  The music is very upbeat.  I have yet to take it out of the cd player in my car.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is really fun. I just got it and I'm glad it finally became available on Amazon and not just on Apple.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book is beautifully written. I am able to tell that the author carefully selected each word. The story is one of redemption yet painfully realistic. The importance of words is emphasised throughout the story and I cannot help but marvel at the brilliance of the narrating. This book is like none other and I will keep this story with me. . A great book for all who love quality writing and a captivating tale.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really cool you can make friends and have a bunch of horses you should definitely play this game if you are a horse lover
B0049J5EOK|5.0|My toddler son loves all of the Toy Story movies and watches them over and over and over.  You can't go wrong with any of them if you have kids, and adults enjoy them too.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Does all it says it does in an understandable way for us non math people.  Love the list ability!!  And the regular works well too if you don't want to buy the pro.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Very sweet movie.  If you have not seen it be warned, the beginning is way more sad than you expect from a kids movie, but it has a cute happy ending.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have been looking for a way to print from my kindle fire since I got it Dec. 2011 and was always unable yo and was very disappointed.  It was a major hindering factor that I hated! !  I was always looking for apps to fill in this problem until Kindle did.  Then one day I accidentally fell over this app and pow!  I install it finds my printer,I hit the print button button and to my surprise and delight it works great!!  Give it a try
B0049J3QAY|5.0|My toddler loves this movie.  You would think he might be scared, but he is not.  He watches it over and over.
160941392X|5.0|Safe Haven was just a good story in itself. The way the author took us back in forth through time was easy to follow and the reader's voices were especially good. Altogether satisfying & entertaining.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|It is a little more graphic at times than others, but doesn't dwell.  Not too graphic.  I like Hannibal's calm, cool, and insane character and was surprised to get to know the Will character - I think he's a great addition to this show!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|i love this game, so many levels to play and its never boring! I could not put the game down because it was so challenging!! I would recommend everyone one to get this game!!!
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother-in-law for a Christmas present..<br />He is happy with it, so I am happy
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very nice. It's great for my husband as he studies his bible a lot. Also able to use his Kindle in church
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I enjoyed reading of the focus, commitment and rigorous test it takes to be one of America's elite service members.  The close bonds that these men developed and their ability to endure in the worst possible situations humbles me.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Game did not work at all after going on Amazon specifically looking for a 2nd Solitaire game to use on my Kindle. It froze just like the first one did.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|A fitting end. Loose ends tied up. Free at last free at last, thank the Light almighty I'm free at last. 14 freaking books. Never again.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I am an artist and paint with acrylics.  This program is very clever and a lot of fun.  It has a very nice assortment of media and it's uploadable.
B009NY43NY|4.0|The turn of events here is not what I expected! As always the book is a page turner and I enjoyed it.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|Some reviews say there is a lack of art work I don't  agree.  They did a adequate job recreating each album, each album contains lyrics and additional art work plus you get a bonus book full of art. And Pink Floyd's visual experience wasn't so much about their album covers as it was about their live concerts. The only thing that could have made this collection better is the inclusion of a singles & rareity's CD. But this is easily remedied buy purchasing the CD's \\"WORKS\\" & \\"The Pink Floyd Early Singles\\". I will say I have never liked cardboard CD cases as they are certainly going to to destroy your CD's. My recommendation to you is do what I did with my Beatles box set, Listen to them to make sure everything you bought is satisfactory and then burn them to blank CD-R's for your listening pleasure and keep your box set as your source material. I promise you the more you pull these CD's in and out of the cardboard cases the sooner you will no longer have music, just pretty little Frisbee's. The sound quality of this collection is beautiful and appears to be the most complete collection of Pink Floyd studio albums available out there right now. This is the way these albums were meant to be heard! No need to get up and flip your album from side A to side B Just press play lay back and enjoy the seamless concept albums from start to finish!!! Better than the good old days... I know I was there.
B007N85POS|5.0|Fun, fun
B00BI73CVI|5.0|it was very good! I think the acting was very good... Anne Hathaway did a phenomenal job, I was not aware she could sing like that.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Didn't care much for the gaming.  No really goals to work for.  Became bored with quickly<br />.  Its not for me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft-pocket edition is so fun and cool and great for the little kids and big kids and adults and pets 1729
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Great movie, nice story-line twists. It's different from most movie formats so can get a little confusing, but overall great plot.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|My grandsons absolutely loved this game and play it often.  It is alot of fun.  Sure to please you little ones.
030758836X|5.0|I don't know if I have been away from something different for awhile or what, but dang, I enjoyed this book.  GIRL GONE by Gillian Flynn is my first book by this author; I will be back for more. It is different.  Told differently and it reeled me right in.  At first I felt funny reading it, like someone peeking into a marriage that shouldn't.  Then it took off.  What happened here?  Who done it?  Was he a killer? He was a cheat.  Was she?  Is she alive?  Who is guilty and of what?  All I can say is get this book.  Read it.  Enjoy.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I rented this film for my 8 year old and he absolutely loves it.  For me, it was just alright.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|I enjoyed the story and the way it was told.  This would be good for young children and not be too frightening and even possibly help young kids face and get over their fears.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|My daughter loves the remake. She watches it all the time, just like how I used to watch the first one! :)
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Some of the episodes on this set are advertised as uncut versions.  I did not watch the show when it aired, so I don't know what extra footage or unbleeped words are included, but the show is definitely TV-MA.  Any given episode may go from moments of light-hearted comedy to horrific violence as Walter White continues his descent.  Bryan Cranston tends to get most of the credit, but the show would absolutely not work without Aaron Paul.  Both are excellent this season.  I haven't availed myself of the extras, but I intend to eventually.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game looked goofy but I downloaded it and can't stop playing it. It has a good balance that keeps you playing.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I don't think there has ever been a fan base of short-lived, but cult favorite, tv show that has ever been more determined to keep their favorite characters alive.  \\"Firefly\\" was a sci-fi series thatran for a few months on the Fox Network in 2002.  Fox clearly had little interest in the show as it was bounced around to different time slots, underpromoted, and eventually canceled with nearly half its episodes unaired (they were later aired the following summer as part of a 'burnoff').<br /><br />  Fox's absolutely disinterest in the show was nearly criminal.  They should have passed and let it be picked up by another network, perhaps even the Sci-Fi (now SyFy) Channel, which ended up doing such a great job with \\"Battlestar Galactica\\".  Not content to be shoved aside by clueless network executives, the \\"Firefly\\" fans, nicknamed 'Browncoats' (after the apparel the rebellion wore in storyline pre-dating the tv series), fought long and hard, and succeeded in getting a full motion picture released, with all the main actors coming back to reprise their beloved characters.<br /><br />  \\"Serenity\\" takes place several months after the chronological conclusion of the television show.  Mal and his crew are still scrambling for any kind of smuggling jobs they can get to pay the bills, with work having become much more difficult since River Tam joined the crew, due to the Alliance fearing what she knows and putting pressure of Mal to turn her over.<br /><br />  A smuggling job gets the crew dangerously close to the Reavers, a bastardized version of once-humans, who are this 'verse's version of zombies.  The events that follow put the crew (and River) back on the radar of the Alliance who send their vicious and merciless 'operative' (Chiwetel Ejiofor) on a mission to hunt down and capture River, while disposing of anyone who gets in his way.  Along the way, the secrets that Alliance has long struggled to keep hidden become known to Mal and his crew.  It is then a race against time(and the 'operative') to get that information out to the public.<br /><br />  \\"Serenity\\" shows what can be done with this this universe when given the proper production budget and resources.  Joss Whedon created a film that certainly ran neck and neck with other sci-fi films (like \\"Revenge of the Sith\\"), in terms of action and intensity.<br /><br />  It's a shame that it still did not get a big box-office return because that essentially negated a chance at any big-screen sequels.  However, the 'Browncoats' remain determined and I would not put it past them to get this show back on the air at some point.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The second season of Sherlock is just as much fun as the first, thanks largely to the actor, who are perfectly cast. The writing is smart as well, and they've brought Sherlock from the 19th to the 21st century easily and believably.
B008OOYALE|1.0|It is a great game but it does not update for kindle users.  You cannot visit neighbors without a crash, and we do not have access to any of the newer dragons that are made with special buildings.  Also after a while you never get any new dragons, like your selector is stuck in a rut.
B00992CF6W|1.0|The new upgrade stinks trees no peaceful mode anymore in all ways IT SUCK BADLY YOU DON'T WASTE YOUR OWN MONEY ON THIS WORTHLESS GAME UN TILL IT IS BACK TO NORMAL PERMANENT NORMAL DON'T BUY THIS APP.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It is a lot of fun being able to style someone. I would recemend this game to ages 10-14.<br />....
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have been hooked since the first time I picked up this book!  I am thrilled to have found this author!  I love the book and cannot wait for the next one!  A definite must read for those who love the fantasy genre!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Why a fourth book.......Why is the story dragging on are we gonna have to wait a year to finish this story....disappointed
B008NW67IQ|4.0|Mumford and sons play interesting music, bluesy and rhythmic.  I like folky music with lyrics you can actually understand, they meet my requirement.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book!! Definitely a page turner...great read! I could not put this down and unfortunately was finished in two days! Purchased another G.Flynn book the next day.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book. I love all the characters, the wit and liveliness of Eliza, the frank practicality of Charlotte, the sweetness of Jane, the silliness of the Bennett parents,  and the complete character of Darcy. It is a romantic book. I love the complete change of Darcy.  I believe her aunt and uncle describe it best, \\"that one of them at least knew what it was to love.\\"  I read this book every couple of years, and every time as  I approach the middle I am engulfed. It is a classic read. I love how it is funny and endearing all at the same time. It is a great read with complex characters and an engaging story.
0979019710|5.0|I had so much fun reading this book.<br />It presents precious information in an exciting, simple, and authentic way.<br />Hal just really boils it down to an essence without beating around the brush.<br /><br />You can read it over and over again to keep gaining valuable insights and most importantly to reinforce the knowledge.<br />Because knowledge becomes real knowledge only when you embrace it and when your actions start to align with it.<br /><br />This book will NOT change your life.<br />But I am firmly convinced that YOU can transorm your life using the information presented in this book.<br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />That being said; thanks Hal for this book. You rock.
B00C81AVNU|2.0|\\"Kinky Boots,\\" with music and lyrics by Cyndi Lauper, just won Tonys for best Musical and best score, and it's hard to begrudge Lauper's win after her heartfelt speech at the Tony Awards. I've always enjoyed Lauper's quirky musical sense, and I enjoy pop-rock musicians venturing into musical theater. Lauper's fellow 80s star Boy George made a strong impression with his fine, underrated score for \\"Taboo,\\" and lesser-known musicians Duncan Sheik and Stew scored with their superb music for \\"Spring Awakening\\" and \\"Passing Strange,\\" respectively.  Of course, Elton John has also had some success with \\"Aida\\" (Tony Award) and \\"Billy Elliot\\" (critical acclaim). But Lauper's score for \\"Kinky Boots\\" is, unfortunately, a disappointment.<br /><br />It starts off on what is a surprisingly weak opening number, in which the main (admittedly catchy) ditty \\"The most beautiful thing in the world is shoes\\" is repeated over and over and over in exactly the same way. (Compare that to the dynamic, funny, and tone setting opening of \\"Matilda,\\" which lost the Tony to \\"Kinky.\\") After that, we move into the forgettable \\"Take What You Got,\\" where star Stark Sands, as shoe factory owner Charlie, shows off an unconvincing British accent (as do other cast members throughout-- a particularly grating flaw on the recording).  Following that, we  get a rather skimpy disco number, \\"Land of Lola,\\" featuring Tony winner Billy Porter as the star drag queen, Lola.<br /><br />Fortunately, for awhile, the score does pick up some steam. \\"Charlie's Soliloquy\\" and \\"Step One\\" put Sands on better footing (pun intended) as his character Charlie decides to move his family's shoe factory into a new direction, specifically by creating over-the-top footwear for Lola and her fellow drag queens.  \\"Sex is in the Heel\\" is a much better song for Porter, probably the score's standout.  After that, Annaleigh Ashford does well with \\"The History of Wrong Guys,\\" a very Cyndi-like pop song that would not sound out of place in the 80s.<br /><br />After those, the score is mainly unobjectionable, but also not particularly distinguished. There are a couple of eager-to-please act closers that lay on the \\"feel good\\" a bit thick, and two ballads for Porter which tend towards the saccharine. Trite lyrics throughout, unfortunately, do not help matters, either. Though I don't hate this score, and think this looks like it could be a perfectly entertaining show (those drag queens look fierce!), I just can't recommend this recording. C+
1476733953|4.0|I have to admit I felt that WOOL missed the mark as I first started to read it. Fast forward two weeks later and I am a few pages from the end of this book and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a solid read with really engaging characters.
0783231032|5.0|Another of my favorite dark comedys that makes fun of America's reaction to the start of WW II.  I especially enjoy the scene of the interrogation in the Japanese sub.  How they got very well known performers to act like knuckle-heads is beyond me!  One of Steven Spielberg's best under the radar creations.  Get it and you will laugh all through the movie.

B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book  is the second  in the selection series. I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as  the first but I  was wrong. If anything this book is better! I can wait to find out what happens next!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Really enjoyed the game. Wish it was longer to expand the story line.<br /><br />Liked not having all the character dialog to wade through.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show with a lot of wit, business and legal know-how, plus great acting! In my book, that equals something I'd watch, any day!
1455502626|5.0|couldn't put it down, it is very long and I'd suggest you make a paper list of the characters, it helped me keep them straight
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started but this is truly my type of game love hidden objects and there is nothing better than a good clean mystery. Being older its a bit hard for me to see but well worth the trouble thks for a challenge
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much I played it 2 hours straight and it has great graphics it is the best game I have on my kindle fire HD

B005K17RU0|5.0|I was very unhappy with my previous weather app. This one is wonderful! It has notified me of severe weather in our area in a timely manner and is easy to follow. Shows current weather on my phone screen all the time. I'm a fan.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Another great John Hughes movie. I absolutely love his movies. I've been watching the Breakfast Club since I was little. Its a great movie I love it.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I really liked this story and the television presentation.  The actors were great and the characters were very well cast.
B009AMANBA|5.0|well deserved, both Day-Lewis and Depp are masters at disappearing into memorable characters.  And this Lincoln rings true.  The historical records tell that Lincoln had a surprisingly soft voice such a power physical and emotional presence.  No one has ever brought this man to life, like this.  Maureen
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|incredible! great graphics and playability ...so many great armors... wish it was a little more sensitive to touch but it just might be my kindle otherwise great game all around.
B00AK57N00|5.0|This application is great for passing time. It isn't all that easy but isn't too hard either. I enjoyed it and I give it five stars. Thanks for such a fun application! :-)
B00CTII57Q|5.0|I watched the last four episodes back to back, and some the acting is the best I have seen yet.  I think Crowley knocked it out the park.  Dean and Sam...bravo.  They ran the gamut of emotion; brought me to tears, and then turned it around with a laugh out loud.  The direction it was going made it seem this was the Series Finale, rather than the Season Finale.<br />Glad it is not!<br />Powerful ending and I am looking forward to Season 9.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|The movie was funnier than I expected it would be.  The story was engaging.  Although promoted for boys, girls will enjoy it too.

B005LW5J9O|5.0|Dan Brown eat your heart out, along with Einstein, Steven Hawkings, and their comrades, present and past. What's old is truly new in this fascinating account of the ancient poet, Lucretius (think 50 BCE!), and his ultra modern view of the universe we live in. There is only one thing permanent in it, Lucretius insists, and that's the atoms that come together, form more and more complex entities, then break apart only to reform again and again. And not only does he make astounding and compelling arguments for his position, Lucretius does it in an epic poem so beautifully crafted, not even the Catholic church in the middle ages kept it suppressed. Kudos to Stephen Greenblatt for making such science interesting and easy to read. Highly recommend this wonderful piece of non-fiction.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I just love the entire Quell series.  It is the only game that I have ever given 5 stars.  Well worth a dollar.... I'm on to play Quell momento.
0307887448|5.0|I've never been a big reader. I'll start books but rarely ever finish them but this book, I couldn't put it down. I was hanging on every word on every page through the whole thing. I honestly did not want it to end. I had a smile plastered on my face almost the whole time I was reading it and I even laughed out loud a few times (something I've never done for a book before).<br />This is easily near the top of my favorite books list.<br />Anyone who is a nerd or loves 80's references with LOVE this book.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book.  I could not put it down once I started.  I had never heard about the Orphan Train and was surprised that it actually existed.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game to put some time into very well made. Pretty decent amount customization given only four characters but still a really fun game
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so excited about this series after reading Bared last year. I cannot even begin to express my disappointment in where this went. Which really was in a circle to know where - c'mon we could've at least gotten a proper ending.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|We were so pleased by the free version of this app that we went ahead and got the paid version - and it has been well worth the price.  Our daughter just loves learning the alphabet through this app, and we have noticed a huge difference in her comprehension after using it. A+
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Like others, I anticipated the 3rd book in the Crossfire Series.  I wanted to see how Sylvia would end the series and where she would take Gideon and Eva.  I stayed off of any internet page that would spoil the ending.  I have to say, I wasn't entirely surprised because SO much happened in the last 50 pages and I began to wonder how she was going to wrap it up.  So, when I got to the end I was relieved that she didn't leave it with so many loose ends and that there would be more *coming soon*.<br /><br />I did think that there was too much going on in the book and I found it hard to get into. Throughout the story there were too many small sub plots and meaningless characters (think Tatiana and Megumi amongst others) that took pages which could have been written to boost the relationship between Eva and Gideon.  I don't know if the characters were props to show a more mature relationship between Eva and Gideon, but it could have been done differently.<br /><br />I did not hate the book but I was not exactly thrilled there would be more to the story which means that I will have to wait another 10 months to see the 4th book.  All of that said, I think it was either too many character sub plots for Sylvia to wrap up, or she felt that the readers would want more without cutting us off with nothing but \\"happily every after\\" for Eva and Gideon.  I WILL be disappointed if we won't see the next book for many months - by that time I will have written my own ending for Eva and Gideon.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wonderful-as all his books are. Story telling at its finest. Beautiful rich characters and a plot that kept me glued to the book and an ending that left me sad yet satisfied.
1469220725|2.0|I waited so long for this book and it was so bad. What a waste compared to book 2. This one ruined it

B0095P29EG|4.0|My family loves to watch this movie, it is filled with a lot of action and it is also funny
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Great read!!!  Harry Hole  is addictive.  Will certainly read more of his adventures.  Not always believable but certainly gripping.  Worthreading
B0095P31L6|4.0|My kids love this movie, it is a very funny movie and the characters are really great. Would recommend it for the whole family to watch.
1616550414|5.0|Very good deal.  NOt cheaper anywhere else.  If you want the English version, this is it.  My wife loves it and is an avid Zelda fan.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This is one of the best MI movies I have seen. It has a lot of suspenseful moments. I would recommend this movie to any one who like to see an action packed movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I hope the movie can do justice to this amazing story I haven't seen it yet but now I really want to!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to read. Buttons are large. Very intuitive. Just a great basic calculator. Adds are not obtrusive. Keeps track of entries which is nice.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It was unique to hear it told from the victim herself.<br />I hope that the proceeds from buying this book goes to the victim and her family.<br />God bless
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|Great actors, Great plot, Great movie.  There are many twists in the movie and it made for an enjoyable experience.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro writes with such a clear, wry view. Her characters are palpably real. Loved this collection that speaks to the long arc of a lifetime.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I concur with other reviewers that Ms. Harris was ready to let Sookie and her world go. It was predictable -and a little sad - but ultimately limped toward the end. I am happy I got to take this journey with Ms. Harris and I thank her for ending the series when she did.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is the best he of all time.  When updates come out it makes it that much better.  The only downside is updates com out later for tue kindle fire then other devices.  Besides that it's a perfect 5 stars.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I've seen all the versions and I feel this is the best.  It touches me each time I watch it.  Good acting.
034554398X|5.0|George RR Martin's Game of Thrones series is so clever, imaginative and well-written, that even though HBO's hacks butchered the story, characters and dialogue, it still makes for highly popular TV. This is a must read for any intelligent person.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Bryan Peterson has given me new levels to acheive in my photography. I am an amatuer, so take it for what it is. I truly had lots of blocks fall into place reading his very teachable language and examples on exposure. This is not a onetime read, but a well preserved reference to always comeback to.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I really like this game, It's pretty straight-forward and easy to get pretty good at.  I only play hardcore mode now as it gives a real challenge, and each game only takes a couple of minutes (easy to sneak a game in while doing other things).<br /><br />I'm sure it'll get old quick if i just sat down and played it for a solid day, but for a game you can pick up and play while waiting 5 min for some random thing in your day, this game is pretty awesome.
B00340O3KQ|5.0|Classic movie that exemplifies awesome acting.  I would rec to any fan of Travolta and Cage.  Ive seen this movie about 5 times and still love it.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I got this because of other reviews I had read.  It's very fun once you get started, the upgrade system is pretty cool, but once you finally max out the upgrades, there's not really much else to do.  It has a Tetris-like feel to the gameplay even tho the way you make matches is pretty unique (unique to me anyways).<br /><br />It was a fun game and I didn't have any real complaints with it, but once I got all the upgrades and 'won', I've pretty much stopped playing it.
B0099114WO|5.0|As any married couple has been together for a while can relate to this movie. I loved it loved the actors as well. I do recommend this movie
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|What a waste of my time and money! The plot was okay if only the actors.....ACTED! Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Again I couldn't put the book down.  Other definitely needs to be another book, because the author leaves us hanging in for more!!!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|\\"A Quest of Heroes\\" is Book 1 of a series by Morgan Rice. I'm not a fan of vampires, so I haven't read any other series by this author. This series is imaginative and moves well. Morgan Rice has created a world of knights and ladies, chivalry, magic, and mythical creatures. If only this magical world included outlines, plot maps, and editors!  The first errors I noticed were in tense. \\"He had saw...\\" is a mistake most word processing software catches easily. Similar problems with verbs happen frequently in the story. Inconsistencies in spelling also distract from the story. For example, on one page Princess Gwendolyn's name was spelled Gwen, Gwynn, and Gwyndolyn.<br /><br />Once I learned to ignore mistakes in grammar and usage, I began enjoying the story. However, key elements are repeatedly redesigned. Thor's journey to Kings Court is told near the beginning of the first book, but when the trip  is referred to later in the story, the details have changed. Characters in the first book, Thor's three brothers, diappear from the story with no explanation. Then they miraculously appear again in Book 5, once again becoming a major part of the plot. Their absence was not explained. In the knight's competition, the king and his family are spectators on the field. Reece and Thor leave the competition and go quickly to the palace, summoned by the king. When they arrive, the king and his court are in the middle of a banquet. How did that happen?<br /><br />As I read the first five books, I finally stopped going back to see if the details were as I remembered. I apparently was paying more attention than the author and editor. Just as in a child's rambling storytelling, time, setting, and history change at the author's whim. I don't think Rice knows what will happen in the next book, or even in the next chapter. I have settled in to enjoy the plots, subplots, and rabbit-chasing, with no assurance that the many conflicts in the story will ever be revisited, much less resolved.A less particular reader may give these books more stars. A more exacting reader may give fewer stars. I will not be recommending these books to my 7th grade students. They need to read books that show good writing techniques, better than the average 7th grade writer.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Greg is still at school, still has Rowley as a friend, but when uncle Gary moves into thier house for a resason a lot of things change Gregs school has a dance Greg is facing or doing any thing to get a dance partner or couple does he. find out in this fabulous book
B008SOS63S|4.0|Good music if you enjoy some magic guitar playing, special guests also great - Beth Hart and John Hiatt were special.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Well I normally don't leave reviews but had to for this book.  I assumed this was the last of the trilogy but was blown away at the ending...and the fact that there will be 2 more books.  This book seemed to be more of a filler to get the next two going.  I feel this whole book could have been axed and just wrap it up already.  I felt the air leaking from the tire on this book.  Hope the next one is better because if its not no one will even think about purchasing the 5th book.  The love scenes are nice but they happened much to frequently in this book. I kept reading hoping to get to the good part then BOOM slapped in the face with the end of the book which really leaves you hanging to nothing basically....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the single best book I have ever read. In one night I have managed to laugh and cry more than ever in a book and I would not have traded it for anything. There were so many thoughts I had while reading this book and every single one of them was more important than any silly question I have ever asked myself. I am so proud to say I have read this book and I hope that every single person gets to meet their Gus Waters in their life. Bavo John, encore! Really thank you so much, I could not hav asked for more in any book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I just don't get the angry reviews of this book. I loved! There was growth for Gideon that I feel hopeful about. Eva still rocks to me, too. And thank goodness! it answered some questions from &#34;Reflected in You&#34;. And yes, it was full of sexy hotness, but not so much I wanted to skip over some of it. I recently finished a book like that and I wouldn't have done it again. And personally, I don't remember reading that this was supposed to be a trilogy, I feel people want this to be Fifty Shades, but...it not!. I'm glad it's not. Hell yeah bring on more books!!! I loves me some Gideon Cross! The story was interesting to me as well. Some parts, I was aggravated and anxious; I like that in a book . Of course I will be reading the next next one. Just hope it doesn't take as long to come out as this one did.
1612680003|4.0|I like dthis book, it had a lot of good pointers, but was basically common sense.  Sometimes people jost do not want to do what it takes to be successful, which is get off your behind!

B00C5W3SBE|2.0|Dreadful.  The main problem (aside from the charisma-free cast) is the appalling script.  Everything that's made Baum's OZ and the MGM Oz beloved has been tossed and replaced with a miserably unimaginative ripoff of \\"Wicked.\\"  The action is slack, the motives of the characters murky, and the storyline hackneyed.  Only Rachel Weisz emerges without serious damage to her credibility, but Kunis, Franco and Williams are nearly unwatchable.  Although I have many objections to \\"Wicked,\\" it's a masterpiece of dramatic art compared to this awful (and financially successful) dud.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Buy this app RIGHT NOW! My best friend introduced me to Subway Surfers. I have almost all the characters so you should BUY NOW!

B009UNH0EM|5.0|This is a good charge cable, exactly the same as the original that comes with the Voyager Legend headsets. But it is not so easy to quickly replace on the spot if you misplace or lose it, as happened to me. On-the-street replacements from some retailers can be costly.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B009UNH0EM Plantronics Voyager Legend Charge Cable]] is a good one, and the new magnetic snap-fit connector has proven to be a good one when attached to the [[ASIN:B0092KJ9BU Plantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth Headset]]. The connector works well in that if someone bumps or jerks the cord, the headset will pop off of the socket safely, without damaging the connector or headset. It's reminiscent of the MagSafe power connector that is found on the MacBook Pro, which keeps keeps that computer from crashing to the floor is someone trips over the power cord.<br /><br />The shortcoming with this cord is that it's only 9-inches long, though that's not an issue for many. The price is OK for a proprietary cord that works, but there is a far better choice for Voyager Legend owners. The [[ASIN:B009UNGYIU Plantronics Voyager Legend microUSB Charge Adapter]] is a far better buy than than the original replacement, as it includes a 24-inch USB to micro-USB charge cable that plugs into the magnetic snap-fit connector. The product images show that it has a short tether, which allows the connector to be attached to the cable so that it doesn't get lost.<br /><br />I had lost my original charges cable when visiting a client site, and was surprised that many retailers did not carry this cable as a replacement. When I finally did locate one locally at a major cell phone store, it was at a substantially higher price. Lesson learned, the hard way.<br /><br />Compare both the price and specs between the replacement Voyager Legend Charge Cable here and the more versatile [[ASIN:B009UNGYIU Plantronics Voyager Legend microUSB Charge Adapter]]. At the time of this review, this multi-function adapter only costs $3.00 more than the original replacement, so there are better choices available.<br /><br />6/10/2013sts $3.00 more than the original replacement, so there are better choices available.<br /><br />6/10/2013

B002VWNIDG|2.0|I saw 'The Shining' for the very first time whilst recently at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado. Apparently, one of the in-house channels runs the feature 24-7. Though it is common knowledge Stephen King was inspired and developed some of his thoughts preliminary to writing the novel, the subsequent adaptation itself was filmed elsewhere, principally in Oregon and England.<br /><br />I consider this movie as more of a psychological thriller than a true horror film. Though there are some genuinely chilling sequences, 'The Shining' is a dated, often confusing series of disjointed vignettes and freeze frames. It is poorly written, engages its actors in embarrassingly ill-considered stagecraft and has been badly transferred to a grainy full-screen DVD format with wretched sound. I think even Mr Kubrick would be embarrassed.<br /><br />It's probably not fair to judge thus harshly after so much time has passed. After all, we do get front-on nudity and the `f' word a lot. There are several other uncomfortable--often inexplicable--moments as well. I'll never envision Yogi Bear the same, I assure you. These things had a certain shock value for their time; still, I'm disappointed. Classic as it may be, it's a poorly made, outdated bit of psychodrivel.<br /><br />I'll eventually go back and see it again. I am curious as to what I may have missed the first time out. And too, I'm open to editing and revising my remarks accordingly. I should probably read Mr King's book as well; I understand Mr Kubrick took off on several tangents, possibly diminishing the impact of the written word.<br /><br />Two Stars (1 ½ really) for now though--and that's a stretch.<br /><br />Russell de Ville<br />10 June 2013
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Up until 3 years ago, I had never heard of Paulo Coelho.  One night, while walking on the upper west of Manhattan, I did what I always do when I see book-seller tables and stands: I helplessly gravitate towards them.  This time, I saw \\"The Alchemist\\" laying right on top of all the other books, and something pulled me to it.  I didn't really get the title, or think I would be challenged or inspired by reading it.  But something told me that I had to have it.  I was getting ready for a major trip overseas to be with a relative that was ill.  I was in the middle of graduate school, and  trying to figure out the direction of my career.  I read this book, and felt as if a Heavenly Angel personally came down to guide me.  The paradox is that nothing in this book is new.  In fact, all of the wisdom and human experiences Paulo writes here, have been going on, discussed, and passed on since the dawn of time.  It is no secret that we live in a time of incredible resources - and equal yearning for emotional satisfaction in life.  The writing style, creativity, and clarity of writing, brought to life and into the hearts of millions an answer that is embedded in each person's psyche: the purpose and meaning of life: YOUR life specifically; MY life specifically.  Who, why, where, what...in a simple, enthralling, creative spark of genius.  Paulo takes us all on an incredible journey that happened a long time ago, in a far away land, but right in our hearts.  No wonder this book is a best-seller.  After reading it and marinating it in my soul, I was deeply inspired to write my book on spirituality and recovery.  My own recent publication is one of the outcomes of having this brilliant author guide me to the next step in my own journey.  \\"The Alchemist\\" is not just some fairy tale, far removed from you. It tells of your own story; but if and only if you have opened up a blank story book, and are ready to start from a different kind of beginning.<br /><br />If you are considering buying this book, most likely you are a Seeker, just like so many of us.  Go ahead and buy it, read it, study it, and most importantly, make it yours.

0786891416|5.0|I was SHOCKED when I found out that Richard Castle was a real author and had written all the books referred to on the &#34;Castle&#34; TV show.  I chose to start with the Nikki Heat series even though I had some interest in the Derrick Storm books too.  Heat Wave was not only a good book on its' own, but the references to it from the TV show made it even better in my estimation.  The whole writing style is quite similar to the TV show - good characters, humor, great dialog, and a good story line with some twists and turns.  All in all - a Good Read.  I'll be getting the rest of the series.
0060977264|5.0|This book is an eloquent mirror of spiritual love; how it should be, how it is, and how we long for it. I was deeply touched, and could not put it down until I was finished reading it.

B003FL4O9E|5.0|always a great movie. Funny, old school fav, came in clear my 9 year old loved it awesome glad its on prime
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was a basically savior because my Xbox broke then a few min later my pc  Broke then I was happy because  I could connect my pc to my phone
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have no problem reading more Gideon and Eva! I love this couple and unlike alot of people I thought this book was fantastic! I loved the twists and surprises and was excited to see she was doing a book four and five. Gideon and Eva have so much to overcome and deal with that I see no problem with a continuation of their story. Life doesn't always have a happily ever after. It's nice to see Gideon and Eva getting to the point where they can lean on each other and trust and work through their problems. I really didn't see their story as \\"finished\\" in just three books. So I am looking forward to see where Ms. Day takes them next.;)
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I don't normally like to read, but this book sounded great and once I started reading it I just couldn't put it down. Great book with alot of suspense and a twist at the end. I would definately advise reading this book. Just loved it.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I don't expect sparkling intellect or credible drama from Ms. Kinsella, but I do expect a fun escape.  I loved other books she has written, but this one just didn't do much for me.  It was a bit annoying.  I couldn't get into the characters and really didn't care how the story ended.
1401234550|4.0|You would expect to see Sinestro back as a green lantern but the Geoff Johns did a good job with this story arc. Definitely gives you a different look at the &#34;villain&#34;  Sinestro.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed the beginning of the book and thought, here we go another great novel from this author.  But, I agree with the other comments about there never really being a strong focus as the story started to include other characters and span the years.  It was a bit disjointed and hard to follow with enthusiasm.<br /><br />I think this needed a few more rewrites before publishing to get many of the \\"kinks\\" out.  Not nearly the level of the first two novels, sorry to say.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I had not seen the trailer for this movie nor really heard much about it. I was in the mood to travel so I watched it.  If you are a reader, writer or an art aficionado you will find this movie delightful. The movie is easy on the mind and has a great cast. It is now part of my movie collection. Makes a nice gift too.
B00846F1YW|1.0|I thought this might be a cool hidden object thing, but it is the same search over and over again, which is likely exacerbated by the fact that every time I leave the game, I have to start from the beginning again. I can't get through the whole story in one sitting, but I also can't save... So, after the second time crashing because I wouldn't/couldn't upload my score (&#34;success&#34;) on Facebook or Twitter, I just stopped playing.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|It is obvious that the band has grown, as these new songs are a multilayered rock and roll desert. Been a fan for a while, and loved Josh Homme and David Grohl in Them crooked Vultures' album. Have been listening to this non-stop since I got it. Favorite track so far is definitely &#34;The Vampyre of Time and Memory.&#34; &#34;If I Had a Tail&#34; and the opening track &#34;Keep Your Eyes Peeled&#34; are also great singles. Highly recommended!!!
B003L77GH4|5.0|although totally in the realm of made up this was entertaining, fast moving and definitely over the top!  worth checking out...
B00701L5XS|5.0|It's perfect! As a captain and circumnavigator, I still can use a review of knots occasionally and this app also allows me to learn new ones. I love it.

B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|If u like the show, you will love the CDs.  Vol 2 has the Fade into you song that vol 1 is missing, so buy both
006441034X|5.0|When I realized that this was a book and not just an animated film, I had to get my hands on the book. I LOVE IT. There is so much the movie left out or changed. This story should be considered a classic.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|John and John Jr. are as mobile and violent as ever.  The action was over the top and really enjoyable.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Ever intriguing, great finish to season! In this season, the writers broaden the story-line to encompass more diversion.<br /><br />Very entertaining!
1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki is the next best author after Dale Carnegie in making management books simplified, to an amazingly great start.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|When an online explanation of the movie is necessary to understand what you just watched, it is probably overly complex.  Just because something is difficult to understand, does not make it intellectual.  The individual vignettes were good enough, but were tied together very poorly.<br />Maybe I missed something, but at the end where they are old and wise, why are they not on Earth, and wherever they are, how the hell did they get there?
B005LAII94|1.0|lame plot, lame movie, with all the superstars in this its not worth the money, absolutely horrible.  3 more words....
B00821OX98|5.0|If you like shows like Walking Dead and other science fiction shows you will like this show.  We were able to watch all episodes of all 3 seasons free by subscribing to Amazon Prime.  The season finale left me in suspense and looking forward to season 2.  The same can be said for season 2 and season 3.  The ending of season 3 has me really looking forward to season 4 if there is one.  Well worth watching if you are into science fiction.  Just remember to overlook occurrences that if they happened in real life would be very improbable but after all it is a show made for entertainment and entertain they do.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I honestly loved reading this book because not only were the steamy scenes great to read, but there was so much humor throughout the book that it didn't make it boring to read at all. Emma Chase is kind very talented writer and I will definitely keep on reading anything she puts out in the market. Definitely recommend this book
B009AMANBA|3.0|Nice costumes and acting, but I couldn't help falling asleep in the movie.  It was mostly about negotiations and going back and forth with arguments, etc.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|If you didn't like QOTSA before \\"Like Clockwork\\" it seems unlikely that this latest effort will change your mind. It's not the commercial, radio-ready work that you will buy after a single catches your ear on the radio.<br />However, if you've casually liked some of the bands work before \\"Like Clockwork\\" I think that you'll agree that you're hearing a band reaching its full artistic potential. It works so well as a singular entity that I think it demands to be heard in its entirety, preferably the first time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun game and I like it a lot ,it is the most played game on my kindle fire.I love it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was so sad when this book came to an end but on the bright side I know this story is not over . Love Eva and Gideon in this story when you find true love its hard to let it go. I must  say that this story started off slow for me but once you get into it  it's a page turner
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I bought this game for my little brothers, who love this app! I haven't found any problems with it, and its really fun! Great app.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|Great read couldn't put it down. Can't wait to start the next book. Keeps you interested not wanting to put it down. Gerald turner
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I just bought a Kindle Fire HD and was looking for an affordable case. This works well because it can be a stand as well as a case and can be turned many ways.
B005OOL1IC|5.0|Awesome movie, great price for the blu ray, no complaints! Great movie to add to your DVD  or blu ray collection.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great game to pass the time, good graphics and controls but needs more updates. Would be 5 stars with faster updates...
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I used to be a Jamie Foxx fan and liked a lot of his movies. Since all of the race card using government we have mainly the White House I am fed up with it. I will not watch this movie because it only seems now just being white is racist. I am not a racist but I am not going to sit back take it. Jamie Foxx got on TV and talking about the movie,joke or not,that he gets to kill all the white people in the movie. This wouldn't have bothered me if we didn't have a racist president and his Administration that we have now.It's bad enough that,Zimmerman who's got a Peruvian mother making him Latino,you really see it all blow up black mobs 8 to 20 jump on one or two whites and say that's for Trayvon. I am also tired of seeing the grade school picture of him as portrayed in the news.
B005IQZB14|4.0|While I recommend this book for adults, it is hard to believe some of the dumb decisions this woman makes.  The descriptions of the Pacific Crest Trail are fascinating.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Amazing ending, I loved this series.<br />Had me hooked from beginning to end and it was hard to put down the book.
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|I had been hanging on to my slime-covered 2-film Ghostbusters collection because I assumed that a nearly 30 year old film would not benefit much from a blu-ray upgrade BZZZT! Yes, Dr. Venkman, I was wrong. But \\"I didn't know you were going to be giving me a electric shocks!\\" GB4K delivers on improved picture, but that is literally ALL we have to celebrate.<br /><br />Having been viewing the film from the privacy of my own home since 1986 on VHS and DVD, I really was astonished at how crisp and clean the print looked. Although you'd think the improved clarity would make the stop-motion work more evident, it actually tones down the more obvious blue screen scenes featuring the Hell Hounds and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, blending them better into their respective backgrounds.The colors on the proton pack streams, Slimer and Gozer powered light shows are vibrant and truly stunning. This is a great viewing experience!<br /><br />As previously mentioned there are no extras (not even a trailer). I'm not sure if this is a limitation of the 4K technology or if they just decided most GB fans already had the other DVDs with extras, but that was a slight disappointment. Still, with a presentation this amazing, you don't need that icing on the cake to get you to buy. Definitely worth your time and your money.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|I choose this movie because of the actors in the movie. I gonna watch it again when I get some more time.  Maybe I'll be able to give it a better rating?
B004JMSIRC|5.0|I had been holding off upgrading to the blu-ray edition of Iron Man because I originally bought the Target exclusive 2-disc special edition encased in an Iron Man face plate and wasn't sure if it would be worth it. Man, was it ever!<br /><br />I have been slowly upgrading my library of DVDs to blu-ray and have been disappointed with the transfer of older films made pre-2004. It's been hit or miss. Maybe that's why the blu-ray presentation of Iron Man really pops and the clarity seems so off the charts.<br /><br />I feel like I've never REALLY seen the film until watching it in this format. The shine and texture of the Mark I armor made me feel like I could reach out touch it and the colors were so vibrant. It really brought new life to a film I have enjoyed for many years. Even the bonus features shine in HD (Stan Lee never looked so good, True Believer.<br /><br />My only wish now is that my IM Face Plate container had room for a 3rd disc, but maybe that would give the DVD edition a complex. Looking forward to upgrading the rest of my Marvel collection.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I saw Avatar so many times.  It's a movie you never get tired of seeing.  The 3D just add flavor to the screen, it makes you want popcorn as if you're at the theatre.
0425263924|5.0|I guess everyone is entitled to their views and opinions.  But I am a hopeless romantic.  This story touched every part of me.  I did get some answers that were pending in the first two books, and came away with new questions, but the book was great page after page.  I held my breath on a few occasions, but was left feeling full.  I am so routing for their love.  Can't wait to see what happens next.  Thanks Sylvia for another great story.  And the ending was good for me as well.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|This port of a Nintendo DS game is a.great buy for any fan of the Final Fantasy series.  I can't say much more than that I like how the gameplay feels... nothing much more to say, so I'll leave it at that.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is good for seeing exactly how much battery you have left on your device i really like how you can change the color of the tubes thats a good feature if you dont know if you should get this app just get its free and if you dont like it then it didnt cost you anything.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have really enjoyed using this app.  It was a life saver the other night when my dog woke me up and then I was having a lot of trouble getting back to sleep.  Created a combo of sounds and then I was back to sleep!  This is a good free one.  I have not found ads or other things to be annoying with this app.  you do have to figure out on the Kindle Fire, that when it asks you to upgrade, you just have to hit your BACK button to get to the app if you don't upgrade.  That was the only little thing.

B0000E64TQ|5.0|Have always enjoyed this album! From the beginning of \\"Funeral For A Friend\\" to the final number, it hasn't got a weak song. In SACD, it is a revelation in surround sound! Highly recommended as the top album from an immense talent.

B000QUEHNK|5.0|Very human story,well written.  I could  relate to many of the episodes.  Sometimes it was really funny, sometimes  poignant. I think everyone can see a little bit of their family in it.  I loved it.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|A rhapsody of love, once ecstatic with newness, now deeper and more authentic after facing the harsh realities of life.  Linklater's Before Sunset is a brilliant film on its own, but best if viewed after watching Before Sunrise, where the story begins. Looking forward to part three: Before Midnight.

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|With 2013's highly anticipated comeback effort [[ASIN:B00C9U9YOW ...Like Clockwork]], it truly is 'smooth sailing for Josh Homme and band, Queens of the Stone Age.  Consistent from beginning to end, ...Like Clockwork joins the company of the most elite albums of 2013.  In a year where rock, particularly alternative rock, has thrived, ...Like Clockwork continues the trend.  If rock and roll ever seemed to be on the cusp of death in recent times, Queens of the Stone Age ensure it is alive and well.<br /><br />Absent of filler, nothing 'breaks the deal' throughout this capable effort. \\"Keep Your Eyes Peeled\\" sets the tone, with its introduction matching the ghostly, haunting  allusion of its title.  Soon enough, a stable, rollicking six-eight groove gets down to business, not to mention strong vocal and lyrical moments from frontman Homme (\\"Fall leaves realize they are no friend of autumn...\\"). Things remain strong on \\"I Sat By The Ocean\\", where more clever play on words and musical personality courtesy of Homme captivate the listener (\\"Time wounds all the heals...\\"). Additionally, throw in some amped-up guitar licks and the 'rock' is firmly planted. \\"The Vampyre of Time and Memory\\" (notice the spelling), makes darkness sound so 'glorious'.  \\"I want God to come/ and take me home,\\" Homme sings, \\"cause I'm all alone in this crowd / who are you to me...\\").  Discouraging and black it is, it does so passionately and soundly.<br /><br />The juggernaut arrives in the clever \\"If I Had A Tail\\", a clear triumph with no questions asked.  Plenty of emotions and rock-n-roll 'stank' is placed in this standout, which  begs for repeated listens.  If that head-nodder isn't enough, an equally alluring \\"My God is the Sun\\" overachieves as well, filled with a full palette of a 'best of' of rock cues. Cleverly, QOTSA make the music match the 'weight' of the title and theme (\\"... kneeling, my god is the sun / Heal them, with fire from above...\\").  \\"Kalopsia\\" see-saws thoughtfully between restrained and 'full-throttled' moments, giving the number sort of a 'split personality' nature. \\"Fairweather Friends\\" is even stronger, delivering lyrically and musically ultimately.  The song, co-written with Mark Lanegan dabbles in the legitimacy of 'friendship': \\"So what's it gonna take / to get you back in bed? / Gossip, drugs, and snakes / they're just our best fair-weather friends...\\"<br /><br />From \\"Fairweather Friends\\" it's \\"Smooth Sailing\\", which finds Homme his boldest of the effort. Buttressed by a funky groove and a carefree attitude, \\"Smooth Sailing\\" epitomizes its title.  \\"I Appear Missing\\" runs a bit long at six minutes, but the allusion to the 'rabbit hole' from Alice In Wonderland is more than enough atonement.  Closing, the title cut takes all elements that make the album 'burst with quality' and concludes as well (or nearly as well) as the effort initiated.  All said and done, [[ASIN:B00C9U9YOW ...Like Clockwork]] is the rare, near-flawless album.  Filled with contrasts, brilliant musicianship, and capable songwriting/concepts, let's face it, IT ROCKS! Highly recommended; 4 ½  Stars.trained and 'full-throttled' moments, giving the number sort of a 'split personality' nature. \\"Fairweather Friends\\" is even stronger, delivering lyrically and musically ultimately.

B00C1CO0XS|4.0|George Benson is a legend, period.  To provide perspective to his legendary musical status, Benson never has to release another album to affirm his place within music history. That said, thankfully Benson blesses his devoted fans with yet another album, [[ASIN:B00C1CO0XS Inspiration: A Tribute to Nat King Cole]].  At the ripe 'young' age of 70, Benson flexes his vocal pipes with the swagger of a much younger man.  Covering the staples of his musical idol, the late, great Nat King Cole, Benson easily does his idol justice. Never missing,  Inspiration - A Tribute to Nat King Cole, is truly an 'inspiration' to not only Nat King Cole/George Benson fans, but fans of jazz, traditional pop, and all styles of music.<br /><br />There is no need to analyze every number, but there are some noteworthy moments worth mentioning.  Benson's swagger is lofty on \\"Just One of Those Things\\", where he scats incredibly agilely.  He matches the same swagger on \\"Walkin' My Baby Back Home\\", a mid-tempo, grooving cut that'll easily incite the tapping of the foot.  Later, \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself A Letter\\" gives off a similar aura.  There there's those signature Nat King Cole cuts like \\"Unforgettable\\" (featuring Wynton Marsalis) or \\"Route 66\\", which both get 'grade A' interpretation from Benson.  Vocal chemistry is superb on \\"When I Fall In Love\\", in which Idina Menzel blends capably with the vet.  \\"Mona Lisa\\" both opens and closes the album. The first take is 'Lil George Benson' as an 8-year old accompanying his vocals with ukelele playing, from 1951.  The closer is one of the more popular standards, and Benson makes it as magical in 2013 as it was back when.<br /><br />Ultimately, [[ASIN:B00C1CO0XS Inspiration: A Tribute to Nat King Cole]] is as much a testament to Nat King Cole's legendary musical presence as it is to George Benson. One of jazz's greatest guitarist as well as one of the most flexible musicians referencing his pop and R&B endeavors, Benson enhances his lot on this 4-star effort.  Highly recommended, particularly to jazz and easy-listening lovers.on this 4-star effort.  Highly recommended, particularly to jazz and easy-listening lovers.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I started reading michael connelly about a year ago, now I have 5 left to read,  awesome stuff....This one was great, however, everytime the author used the word \\"i\\" I wasnt sure if it was haller or bosch at first.  no big deal
B007L4T234|5.0|I read all the time, but only a few books on this kind of topic. Its a book I had a really hard time putting down. It may seem rude or &#34;sick&#34; to some, but its a part of life that many (unknown to us) live in. Very good books
B0063IH60K|3.0|I love the game features. Ads are annoying, but I tolerate them to play the game.  If I were that annoyed by the advertisements, I would get up and play the game only on my computer ...go figure
B0038P59A0|4.0|Action packed movie with lots of wit. Something the whole family can watch.  I recommend this as a movie for a fun night in.
B00AK57N00|5.0|dis I like it somehow reminds me of cut the rope for some reason and it gives me that feeling
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|A great interpretation of The Eight Pages. Possibly the best. Two things, though. I want Chapter 2, and this game is... Well, its hard, but not scary. The graphics aren't great, but that's okay, its built for a phone and didn't have a $2,000,000 budget like some of these ridiculous HD apps do. They certainly don't hurt it. But Slender sort of just... Appears. Everything just... Is. There's no real scary factor. It IS ludicrously fun and he catches you unawares, but overall, its just not scary. Still, very fun.

B007FIY3VW|2.0|Bought this for my kindle and it's hard to use and you really can't use it for any type of papers
0670026603|4.0|This book made me think a lot about &#34;what if this would happen to me tomorrow&#34;. Great for Book Club discussion.
0425263924|4.0|I liked Entwined with you; I think the characters grew a lot on this one and I enjoyed the side histories.  I didn't care about the Russian mafia crap... to me that was a little too weird.  I wish Sylvia had shared ahead of time her intentions of extending these series to a 5 books instead of 3; just to control our expectations :)
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but found it quite difficult to get through a lot of the medical terms.  Other books I have read on this subject were easier to comprehend.  The bottom line of what it had to say, though, and the reconfirming of some of my childhood teachings, all continue to help me strengthen my faith and spirituality.  It does my heart good to read that God loves us so much, it is beyond our human comprehension and that we can do nothing that can’t be forgiven.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|The DVD was very well done and the bonus concert was a nice addition to the package. Most fans of this band will enjoy it even though most of the interviews don't really have much new information for someone that has followed the evolution of the group.
B00000DF6O|5.0|B.B is the King, for many reasons.  And this work helps to prove that.  No dubbing, all songs written by B B, As a Blues guitarist he has long been an icon.  His long history as a composer, player and performer are really obvious in this mature and lovely CD.  It has the confidence and sophistication one would expect from someone with his wonderful track record and creative talent.  Buy this.
B00975L81Y|2.0|When a band names an album The Manticore and Other Horrors, that's a sign they're out of ideas. I'm a Nymphetamine/Thornography fan. After that, Cradle of Filth has gone steadily downhill. Godspeed was worse than Thorn, Darkly worse than Godspeed, Manticore worse than Darkly.<br /><br />Cradle of Filth is a band that depends on a layered sound. Two guitars, bass, drums, male vocals, female vocals, and keyboards. There was a time when all of those were done by separate people. There's only three members left in the band now. Dani Filth's vocals are fried. The current drummer only knows how to play blast beats. Paul Allender, the most important member of the band, can't be expected to consistently come up with good leads for the bland songs.<br /><br />On a positive note, the symphonic tracks, absent on Darkly, have returned. Unfortunately, they're the only standout songs. On the many downsides, there are no epic-length tracks, which is something the band usually does well.<br /><br />The band's goal was to return to more punk-based riffs and avoid the uniformity of their previous two albums. This failed. Ever song mine as well be called &#34;Some Monsters and BDSM Stuff.&#34; It doesn't sound like Nymphetamine, and it definitely doesn't sound like their classic era. It sounds tired and out of ideas.<br /><br />**The deluxe edition comes in a digipack with two bonus tracks that are as bland as the rest of the album.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Cannot go wrong with this movie. I really enjoyed this movie, and it's for sure my favorite Daniel Craig one so far.<br /><br />Having the UltraViolet digial copy is a plus as we view a lot of our movies on Vudu (which is connected to UV).
B008VO3PA4|5.0|5 stars it is halerise  if you have a cat you can relate to the book I would recommend it to cat lovers
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Thanks to Kai and Michelle Chamuel(The Voice) I like Grenade.  Love, love, love - Just the way You Are - it is everywhere.
B0028OF7TA|5.0|She loved the package.  It was sent in a timely fashion and had all the elements of a fine boxed set.  She loved the music and it was packaged very well.  Thanks
B009LXECF6|5.0|I became an even bigger Bruno Mars fan when Kai sang When I was Your Man on Ellen.  Like him as a person and as an artist.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory and enjoyed watching the season in order from beginning to end.  I laughed and laughed.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I love Lady Antebellum.  They are so &#34;down to earth&#34;.  Like that they are so genuine, it reflects in their music.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|its amazing app now you'll never be bord again it will be like if your in the game .....LOVE IT
0679746048|5.0|Purchased this book for .01 with delivery cost.  I really wanted the book.  The description said that there would be a CD.  I received no CD with the book but I was not disappointed.  Book was in good condition.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled was fantastic! It was so refreshing to read a romance written from the guy's point of view. The fact that this particular guy happened to be a perverted, crass, man whore turned good guy made it even better. I was laughing throughout and fanning myself during the steamy scenes! Great job Ms. Chase!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the last of the 3 books Stieg Larson wrote and I just had to get number 2 and 3 after reading the first one, which was recommended by a friend to me and my husband. This man n e v e r reads anything fiction... he got it from his daughter who told him it was a &#34;must read&#34; and we agree....it has kept us up late many times it is that hard to put down. I would nver have bought these books if left to my own devices... BUT THEY ARE GOOD. ☺
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|Good story with awesome characters. I just came off reading Glen Cook's Black Company which I thought was phenomenal, so I'm comparing everything to that. Garden's of the Moon has great characters which are fairly well developed. The story is comparable to Game of Thrones in that there are many characters with dynamic loyalties from chapter to chapter as they discover what they themselves are really about. If you've read all available Game of Thrones books, and have already read the Black Company, this is definitely a good series to follow up with.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|There were many helpful hints for authors who have not yet put together their books for publishing on Kindle. This book will help you avoid the formatting issues that so many indie authors experience when trying to get their book out to the public. Thanks to Amazon for providing it for free.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you like scheming, justice, complete DISREGARD for justice, rooting for and against different characters at different times, brutality, and the possibility of anyone being able to die at any given time then you'll love this series. Good luck trying to read this book to fall asleep at night. If you've already watched the HBO series just remember that NO television depiction has ever come close to fully capturing the books they came from. After you finish this series (whenever it ends) you'll be googling &#34;books like Game of Thrones&#34; to find your next read.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The book was more worn then I expected from the description.  Have not read it yet.<br />Will buy &#34;like new&#34; or &#34;nearly new&#34; next time.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The only thing more epic than this show are the books themselves. Great job of screen adapting a series. As thorough and detailed as I've seen.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I very rarely go for books that are reviewed as &#34;laugh out loud&#34; funny because every person's sense of humor is different.  I was having a hard time finding a new book to get into after reading Connected and Beauty from Pain.  This book did the trick.  It is hilarious, witty, clever, different, and HOT. I have told all my book lover friends to read it and they are obsessed too. It was such a refreshing read being that it is from a total guy's point of view. It is such a page turner, full of steamy angst, and I plan on reading it several more times. Love love love Drew!

B006CUDDUG|5.0|Excellent story, very dynamic pace, with complex twists and unexpected events... It will capture you!<br />The book is quite compact, so perfect for reading during a trip
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This is more than a cookbook.  It is a history of some of the most important foods in our diet, how they came to be and how they possibly influenced the evolution of man and his culture.  I is a wonderful new perspective on the foods in our diet, how they are important and how modern man has so perverted some foods so that they are less than useless.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in anthropology, comparative cultures and, for that matter, anyone who is interested in eating.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|We are a family of Twilight lovers.  This was not different;  Nothing bad to say, just love all the movies in this set.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|It was a funny insightful book and a light read if you are interested in being entertained. I had laugh out loud moments, loved it.
0553385461|4.0|If you are curious and have an interest in science this is a very good book to read.  Just gives you that much more to think about.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book made me so angry, it was the worst book I have EVER read, it was repetitive and the story was rubbish, terrible!!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|My kids and I can spend hours playing Uno.  This purchase was well worth it. Great for traveling, no lost cards.  Definitely recommend.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Love it!  Highly recommend it to anyone wanting a great 3D movie to watch in your own home.  Love it!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Very intense novel! Read in one day...complex modern themes of War and  Terrorism explored sensitively in thought provoking manner. Highly recommended.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game its fun and cool everyday I play it and all the levels its totally a five star game I just had how we need Internet or wifi for this
B0019CSXAM|5.0|as a HUGE HIMYM fan, this season was obviously a must have. has all the episodes from the season plus extra with commentary and other special extras.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Everything I expected from this Country Pop Trio - fun to listen to.  Beautiful vocals, upbeat music - looking forward to next album
B000HT3P7E|5.0|the beginning of the HIMYM series. essential for any fan to see where it all started. has all the episodes and tons of extras for you to enjoy all the more.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is the best puzzle game I have played and I have tried several . It has many different puzzles for free or to purchase. Try this one first and you won't need any other!
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|as a HUGE HIMYM fan I loved having this season. great extras and easy to use between episodes. definitely you can tell this is the beginning of the stories of the characters, but this season is a must have to get to know the backgrounds of everyone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am also intrigued with this series and so thrilled there will be more books to come in the future. I cannot wait to see where it will go next!
B00005JMCN|5.0|Watched it with my son and 7 year old grandson.  We all loved it!  Great message about overcoming obstacles in life.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Not even an attempt to make any of it half way coherent.  Just had to laugh through the lameness, and enjoy the action.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|Free version is too limiting. Doesn't provide much fun. It would be much more fun if each section provided more options.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A cute a quirky quick read, I would recommend it to any fans of fantasy literature, books and reading, or daring adventures.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is a really cute movie! Even liked by my 4 year old son. I highly recommend it! We rented it, first. Just to make sure we liked it. But this is one we could have just bought, unseen.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book has to be the best book in the world!!! All the emotions, actions, jokes, and so much more!!! If I had to chose one book in the world to read it would be Wonder!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed the puzzles. Great game. Can't wait for the next one! Animation was very good and it had lots of details.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is the best game ever on my kindle i play it 24 7 i think this is worth 6.99
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|It's an interesting screen adaptation of actual Viking history. Hopefully, though I am skeptical, that will be kept in it's proper context.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a fun game but on survival monsters just appeared in my home but otherwise a great game I recommend gather as much wood as possible then make a hole and bed and live in it and then make a house
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis gives an outstanding performance. How the story delves into the mind of Lincoln as a lawyer is a different perspective of this larger-than-life figure and his struggle with the moral dilemma of his age.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Loved it but even on easy slender man seemed to be everywhere I hate to admit it but I had to delete ﻿the game because I couldn't take 1 step without him jumping  off a building  or something
B005H8DEMG|1.0|Not at all what I expected from the trailer. I'm not much of a fan of classic plays, and that is really what this is: traditional theatre brought to the silver-screen. In short I found it so painful I didn't even make it through half way. If you are a fan of such work you'd probably love it.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|I agree with everyone else's review's game is amazing I like how they make fun of different things for the costumes
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show manages to stay on task through shuffling of admin staff. At times the show seems to lose direction but always seems to find itself in the end with ideas how to move the story forward in new and better ways while keeping the essence of the story alive and genuine.
B00014TJ7K|4.0|Had some songs I had not heard before.  It is really a good album! You gotta love George! I love it!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I liked it overall. I didn't care for the CGI, however, which severely detracted from the immersion in the film. Why bother with all of the detailed costumes if you're simply going to use tech from a decade ago?
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|This is a really great video of the entire concert! This is from Ringo's Birthday.  The all starr band is amazing!  Some nice audience footage too!
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|It was simple, well done and well coordinated tale told in a contemporary style. In short I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Lots of hidden object games. Being able to zoom more would be helpful on my 7&quot; Kindle Fire. Interesting storyline. Easy enough to find what is needed to progress without being boring.
0060594896|5.0|I found Jack's book very interesting to read and it has a number of tools in it which help in the process. It's also very motivational, and has great ideas in it and suggestions towards other books like &#34;Think and Grow rich&#34; which I've now read several times as well. I hope to start working on these principles when I can find some money to make my films and TV series, it's such a long haul.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Cannot see anything past the ads. If you want us to pay for it do not offer it for free. :(
B00C061I3K|5.0|Random Access Memories is as classically original and every bit as tasty as every other Daft Punk album. Unlike the others, I enjoy this album best on a random track play, instead of playing in its continuous order.<br /><br />Well worth the wait!
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|This album along with her other tribute album to Bill Evans are just beautifully produced.  The song choices here are the standards that Baker was known for and they come alive and seem fresh with Eliane's wonderful piano and her husband's jazz bass.  If only we could have her return to St. Louis for another great concert at the Sheldon.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Not a very necessary app, but since I have room what the....  It's a large representation of the very small battery display on my device.  Easy for old eyes to see.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Whether you need to hold on, let go, &#34;man up&#34;, or get a life, this is a great book about delusion and reality. Loved the antics and the ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|when is the 0.7.0 update coming out for kindle fire?!?!?!?I have been waiting and when my friend told me about it- IT DIDN'T show up so PLEASE try to get the update
B0002TJGQS|5.0|If you plan ahead, there is amazing savings by buying &#34;button&#34; style batteries online. My bike helmet light is working again!
1476733953|5.0|A thoughtful and engaging read the reviews of Wool show that not only is it well written, but it's timely and touches on something we as a culture are attuned to.  Wool isn't so much about living underground in a silo, really it's about power, control and how science dictates culture.<br /><br />Hugh Howey has taken a unique approach in presenting his view of a dystopian future. Instead of the dramatic moment where the world is annihilated, or the cathartic return to the world outside, he gives us the moment of human awakening. Wool depicts a precipice and that moment of change is the real thrill of quality science fiction.<br /><br />Despite being a science fiction novel, Wool's isn't really about science. In an uncharacteristic move for the genre, Wool does not feature high tech science. There are no ray guns or delithium crystals.  In fact the focus is on the mechanical workings of industrial machines.  Nuts and bolts are far more frequently discussed than what little technology there is.<br /><br />What brings it into the world of sci-fi though isn't what science there is, but how it's used, who controls it and the impact it has on those who live under it's influence.  Howey addresses these issues in two ways, one by showing us the effect of science on humanity (being forced to live underground as the air above is toxic) and through the use of technology within the silo (as controlled by the IT department).<br /><br />The possibility of Wool is what thrills and terrifies readers.  I know, without a doubt, that the things Howey describes are possible.  I believe humanity is capable of the kind of atrocities which led to the creation of the silos.  And the idea that we would use power to manipulate and control a populace is not only true; it's been proven throughout history.<br /><br />In the words of L. Ron Hubbard: \\"...science fiction, to be credible, has to be based on some degree of plausibility.\\"<br /><br />The thing I find so thrilling about Science Fiction is exactly this: it is possible.  It's not going to happen now or maybe at all, but the possibility seals my mind in the world of a book.  I'm invested because I believe.<br /><br />Another hallmark of the Science Fiction genre is the inclusion of the cultural sciences.  If done well a sci-fi novel will include not only technology but psychology, anthropology and sociology: creating some of the most realistic and fleshed out cultures that have ever existed in fiction.  The reason for this is the Science Fiction writer's commitment to writing about the real and the possible.  Once you've researched how a nuclear reactor works and figured out a way to make it propel a space craft it's only natural to put the same effort and commitment into every aspect of world building.<br /><br />Wool details the culture within the Silo with subtlety and ease.  People are sorted by living quarters, jobs and even the color of their work clothing.  The mastery comes in with how completely everyone buys into the system.  Even though the novel follows characters who are questioning the rules, their mind set is so ingrained with the status quo, the simple act of thinking takes tremendous courage.<br /><br />From food preparation, population control, government and law enforcement, Howey creates a fleshed out world with attention to detail so meticulous that by the end, you find yourself looking at the open sky, wondering why you're above ground.<br /><br />The other door Science Fiction opens is for the author to explore issues of philosophy, religion and culture.  Because technological advancement and cultural shifts are fundamentally tied - this is proven throughout history - it is logical to think through the effects that the imagined technology will have on the people who live with it.<br /><br />The focus of Wool isn't science, or even a dystopian future.  The focus is humanity.  Out of all the questions the human species has asked itself in the history of our evolution, the most important, by far, is `Why are we here? What is our purpose? What will my life mean?' These questions have been the driving factor behind every war, on both sides. Acts of great charity and great evil are borne out of the need to find these answers. And so is great fiction.portant, by far, is `Why are we here? What is our purpose? What will my life mean?' These questions have been the driving factor behind every war, on both sides. Acts of great charity and great evil are borne out of the need to find these answers. And so is great fiction.
1607066017|5.0|Really great story, with great artwork. Couldn't be happier! Read it! It's worth it. If you're looking for something to read, look no further. Thumbs way up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazon finally updated minecraft pocket edition to 0.7.1 so everyone can stop complaining about the when the update is coming out enjoy
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is my second game like this and I absolutely love them.<br />Great traffics a d story lines!  A must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Very useful can be fun to use it is also kid friendly. The new features in this blog post about the same time.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I started reading GOT after watching seasons one and two on HBO. I love all the extra details and care the author puts into each character, their personality, their roles in the plot. He also really develops all the different houses (lords) and how they have interacted in the past and what their sigils are/mean and how their are intertwined to one another. The books just have a lot of details in general about everything, but they aren't tedious to read like Lord of the rings.  So far at book two they have been a long, fantastic read. Really captivating! plus the author knows how to make you feel emotions and fall in love with certain characters and hate others, but he lets them surprise you with how multidimensional they can be. The author is also not afraid to through huge surprises into the plot! If you want some long term entertainment in the form of a great book I would highly recommend.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I really love this app. But when I tried getting on it it went to my real Facebook page. I tried going to both but it would still go to my real page.... But other then that I loove this app!:)
B005COO1X6|4.0|This is a short read but well worth my time and money. King knows how to make inanimate objects become utterly terrifying.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book was perfect. It had its ups and downs and that makes it a great story. I loved the characters and the descriptions. It was a great romance novel. I CAN'T wait to read about Alex's brothers stories.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I wish there was more to come, but every good thing usually comes to an end. Cant wait for the movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Well what can I say, the app simply converts my S3 into a kindle. Can read, shop for books. Its great !!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|What makes this show so much fun to watch are the display of modern opulence and sophistication, witty dialogue, and the excitement of a talented novice entering the cut-throat, yet financially rewarding, field of legal battles. All the characters have complex and peculiar personalities, which allow for the comedy to spring naturally.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is a book that kept me wanting to read more.  I found it hard to put down once i started reading it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome. It lets you run on top of trains to collect coins. It's an amazing game!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Well, I have never flown before, and after seeing this, I may never fly. It has some nudity, so, watch the kids.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|This is my first Micahel Buble album and I love it.  Will certainly buy more and will have to look into his others.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Not much into writing, so all I can say is it was a good story, must see. It will be worth your money.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I like this game better than the orginial Cut the Rope because it is more interesting. You have more challenges & have to think if you want to get all 3 stars. Whick I do ever time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|REVIEWED FOR: Sinfully Sexy Book Reviews<br /><br />I have to be honest, I don't know how unbiased this review could possibly be.  For the past ten years, I believe, as long as Sylvia Day has been writing, I've been a die-hard fangirl.  I will read, literally, anything she writes.  But, there's a very good reason for that.  She tells a story So. Damn. Well.  Her writing draws me in and holds me captive until I, with great regret, turn the last page.  Emotion, fascinating characters, intense sexual chemistry, beautifully inspiring romance...these are only a few of the characteristics of a story from Sylvia Day.  I'm absolutely thrilled to share with everyone that Entwined with You, book three in the international phenomenon that is the Crossfire series, is each of those things and more!!<br /><br />Entwined with You picks up immediately where Reflected in You left off.  For those who, somehow, may not have read this series yet, I won't be giving details in order to avoid spoilers.  I will say that book three most assuredly moves Gideon's and Eva's relationship forward, and in a way that was so unexpected, but absolutely delightful to me!  There was less angst and more romance.  It's no secret that I'm a fan of angst in my stories, but, truly, this was a gorgeous and refreshing change of pace.  I LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT!!!<br /><br />Certain important questions do remain unanswered at this point; however, there would have been far too much to resolve had this been the final book in the series.  I've come to care for each of the fascinating characters peopling Sylvia Day's Crossfire world, and I need to have resolution for every single one of them.  I don't ask for much, do I *grin*?  Very honestly, I completely understand the necessity of a book four and even a book five.  That same honesty compels me to admit that I will happily read as many Crossfire books as Sylvia Day wants to write!  I love these characters and this world, and I have no desire to see it end any time soon!!<br /><br />Now, let's talk sex.  I know, I know.  You've all been waiting so patiently!  Here's your reward, then.  The sexuality in Entwined with You is dialed up to the MAX!!  That was somewhat of a surprise to me, and, as I'm being completely honest here, I enjoyed it immensely!  On a serious note, there is something about the way Sylvia Day writes these scenes that speaks to me when so many other erotic romance authors leave me cold these days.  The intensity and chemistry were tangible.  There were moments I felt so totally enveloped by the atmosphere she created between Gideon and Eva.  This author does sensuality equally as well as fierce, fast, raw desire.  As Gideon's and Eva's physical relationship is so much a part of who they are as a couple, this remains an important and essential aspect of the series.<br /><br />Entwined with You is, in my opinion, another Sylvia Day masterpiece of sizzling, jaw-dropping sexual attraction, ardent obsession, and impassioned romance.  There should be absolutely no doubt that this is an author at the top of her game and at the peak of her genre.  There are reasons the Crossfire series is read and loved around the world.  While the larger-than-life relationship of Gideon and Eva is at the forefront of those reasons, do not discount the continuing genius and sheer talent of their creator, Sylvia Day!!  Hey, I was honest.  Life-long fangirl, right here!<br /><br />Enjoy this one, friends.  Clear your minds of all of the daily stressors of life, sit back, and drink in this female fairy-tale of sex and romance.  When you're done, share your thoughts in a kind and constructive way.  I hope you all enjoy Entwined with You even half as much as I did.  If you do, I know--I know--you'll turn the last page and breathlessly await book four!!<br /><br />5 Stars & Bravo to Sylvia Day!any time soon!!<br /><br />Now, let's talk sex.  I know, I know.  You've all been waiting so patiently!  Here's your reward, then.  The sexuality in Entwined with You is dialed up to the MAX!!

There should be absolutely no doubt that this is an author at the top of her game and at the peak of her genre.  There are reasons the Crossfire series is read and loved around the world.  While the larger-than-life relationship of Gideon and Eva is at the forefront of those reasons, do not discount the continuing genius and sheer talent of their creator, Sylvia Day!!  Hey, I was honest.  Life-long fangirl, right here!<br /><br />Enjoy this one, friends.  Clear your minds of all of the daily stressors of life, sit back, and drink in this female fairy-tale of sex and romance.  When you're done, share your thoughts in a kind and constructive way.  I hope you all enjoy Entwined with You even half as much as I did.  If you do, I know--I know--you'll turn the last page and breathlessly await book four!!<br /><br />5 Stars & Bravo to Sylvia Day!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I'm an angry birds fan & really enjoy this games. Of couse, I compare it to Star Wars which is even better..
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Depressing not funny. Wasted money. F*** every other word. Would not recommend. Wish I wouldn't have spent the money.  Do not waste yours.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm an Angry Bird fan & a Star Wars fan so this gives me the best of both. I love getting all the pictures of the characters on the one page. Sound effects are great along with the little extrasyou can do on the planet screens.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Life of Pi is a movie and book of great importance.  Everyone should give this story a read or watch.  The blu-ray edition does not disappoint.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|It's a good game but hard to understand how to play it. Sometimes the vehicle has to fall apart to get the points but not always. A better explaination on how to actually play the games & get points is needed.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It seemed like the author got board, and said done! Not so happy with that ending?<br />Could have been so muck better.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I cannot review it as I did not receive it.  I downloaded the audiobook and instead received excerpts from two other classics under this title.  What happened?
B002I9Z8CG|5.0|Lots of extra features!! Video quality much better than on VHS or DVD. Sound quality absolutely terrific!!! Would suggest to anyone.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I really liked this movie, and so did my 5 year old son.  He has seen it repeatedly.  It provides a good message to both boys and girls that women can be heroes too.
0385349947|3.0|i enjoyed this book throughly but i found it hackneyed at times. the part of the book i enjoyed the most was learning about the different women in the world and how they are treated and the different stories that she tells. the part of the book i did not love was the receptive ideas that she portrays. i think that this is a great book for women to read. it teaches women how to impower themselves and work to get where they want to be.it teaches them the inequalities in life and how women have to work harder to get what they want. i reccomend this book to women graduating college but i would not reccomend it to someone in high school because it is hard to relate.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|A good entertaining movie somewhat stretched in credibility. The Lead roles were well cast but Sean Connerly will always be James Bond.
B00427X9WI|5.0|Great movie!  Kind of makes you reflect on your own life, to see where you are in your life.  Wish I had the bravery she had to make changes.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|This movie has become a Classic and I am sure I will see it again. Reception was good. I enjoyed the music.
1478978082|3.0|Well, there may be a few who don't, but most do.  I had no need to keep on turning the pages on this one...or continue listening as I had the audiobook.  Go over to Audible to hear how much people really were unhappy with the replacement voice talent.  While the talent was pretty bland, the story did not help much either.  Almost like this got handed off by Connelly with 20 bullet points for a framework around which some underling author could stretch a story.  I finally felt a need to go out of my way to finish the book with the ending action...but the wrap up was not really that interesting.  I could try and lay the blame totally on the voice talent, but I can't.  The book just seemed to be missing elements that make the Bosch series an always enjoyable venture.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was cool. I liked it. I'm writing random words now because I needed seventeen more. Ugh, I'm finally done.
B00BDSRISA|3.0|i liked the last album better that being said this one is ok , and when i go back and listen again i will probably like it more
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|enjoy it a lot. not a lot of time to wait for things to finish growing ect...always tasks to complete.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It is pretty good and easy to use for beginners and lite on your hardware like your tablet. I recommend it.
0760336954|5.0|Great Book with many pictures and writings.<br /> i like that it has the demo of drawing cars.<br />sad that peter schreyer's works description is very limited in the book
B000KJT8IG|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this when you're looking for some good laughs without any hardcore, raunchy language.  A classic the entire family can enjoy over and over again.
B003NWS5AO|3.0|I have always loved Robert Plant and when I heard &#34;Satan, your kingdom must come down&#34; at the intro to the TV show BOSS, I was compelled to buy this CD, That said, I did not care too much for the rest of the album.
1416955070|5.0|Total easy teen read, but completely entertaining. Couldn't put it down, finished three books in 10 days and they were all fantastic.
1623420148|5.0|Tangled is a book I totally recommend! I have read tons of books in the Adult romance category and this one is just so refreshing and different with a male point of view.  Drew, the main character is so witty and funny, yet very masculine. I loved his point of view and the entire storyline.  I can't believe this is Emma Chase's first book. She is an amazing writer. Can't wait for another book from her.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What can you say other than wow. Suzanne Collins closes out her trilogy brilliantly. The only complaint is that the ending seems rushed.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Box is very soft and the look of the box is very nice. It's sad that the Christopher Nolan Trilogy is over but It's Christopher Nolan, it's probably not over :D
0374533571|5.0|I am not finished with this book yet, but I am loving it!  I have always heard about EAGLES fans, and reading about it corroborates what I have heard.  Can't wait to read it to the end., to see what's in store for Pat.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's Awesome, fun, all around great. Reminds me of world of warcraft and minecraft mixed into one game. Love it
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great acting, a little inside to mental illness, great ending. Too much f word though. Long movie, perfect for passing time on a road trip.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This book was very well written. My only compliant is that it was slightly far fetched and at times; hard to follow. I realise that the third book will hopefully clarify things....yet I still don't quite understand what happened.
B000F6IOBQ|5.0|I had this movie once before but we lost it in the move now I have it again and have watched it 4 times already!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|the best, most mind stimulating show that I have ever watched.  I love the show and LOVE AJ COOK!!!!  I WANT TO MARRY HER!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Slim design, lightweight, and not at all bulky when reading. Also seems pretty durable and gives me enough confidence to not even buy a screen protector.
B003B02O7I|5.0|If you enjoy easy  reading, this Grisham novel is for you. A good read, full of the descriptives of the Pantanal, which must be a wonderful place....
B00006AW2G|5.0|Had the LP for 35 years, and replaced it with this CD.  Gimme Shelter alone is worth the price, it's far and away my favorite here.  Monkey Man and You Got The Silver show off Keith Richards' guitar mastery, and even a rare vocal (for those days).  With Brian Jones contributing less and less, Keith picked up the slack and then some.  Great tunes throughout the album.  If you're only familiar with the Stones' early hits/singles, it may take a while for this album to grow on you.  Just like the longer songs (Midnight Rambler, You Can't Always Get What You Want), this collection needs a bit of time to be absorbed.  It's worth the effort.
1475972350|5.0|This book draws you in from the first page as Mr. Bjornson wakes up unable to move at the hands of a killer. From there, Todd Thiede progresses the story forward to different murders. The murders are scary and creepy, but they make you want to keep reading more. Max and Jesse make great, trustworthy partners, and the story overall is quite creative. There are a few typos and errors, but it doesn't take anything away from the thrilling plot. This was a pretty disturbing, but suspenseful and interesting read.
0316154687|5.0|This is my favourite of the Sedaris books!!! Granted i've read them all and would recommend just about any of them.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Everything is resolved, which I guess is a good thing, but it was almost in a &#34;and everyone lived happily ever after&#34; kind of way.  Like a freight train going 50 Mph stopping on a dime and changing direction...  Some of Sookie's revelations had an &#34;it's about time&#34; feeling, but for the most part, it was just OK, and a little dry on actual plot.  However, I loved the Sookie series, and while I felt it was getting a little drawn out in the past few books (too much politics, not enough romance) I will forever love that Charlaine Harris created this world and shared it with the rest of us.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was perfect! I love a challenge and this was definitely that. Can't wait for the next one! Ill be getting it!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|It's action packed and follows along the line of being as the title says Mission Impossible ... follows the  old tv show as far as being a pretty impossible task.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day gives us yet another great book in the Crossfire series.  With every book, we get a little bit closer to Gideon.  I didn't want this book to end.  I wanted to stay with Gideon and Eva and see what comes next.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series.  Gideon is absolutely delicious :)
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Leave it to the Wachowskis to brilliantly adapt a great work of fiction into a great movie. Tom Hanks as an muderous Irish thug and Hugh Grant, as a face painted warrior licking the blood of his latest victim off of the blade of his knife. One can only imagine the fun that this awesome cast had while playing wildly divergent multiple rolls in one movie and they all do so with the skill one expects from a great actor. While losing some of the book's spiritual power the movie is a great work on its own. I could never have imagined Old Georgie as the voodoo devil character so brilliantly played by Hugo Weaving. This movie completes his resume as one of the all time greatest movie villains and with no less than five of the most vile characters we will ever encounter on the screen, Bravo!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Love watching the TV Showa every week. I also have the other two dvd series, love the cast & crew
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is such a traditional movie to watch each Xmas.  I watch it every year and will pass it down to my grandchildren!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The book pulled me in from the very begining.  The author provided a view to the world that I'm sure is often overlooked.  I truly felt for these women!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Great Movie to watch at  Xmas.  This is a must have for the Xmas movie list...wonderful for all generations.  Great!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|From the first page I was fully in Park and Eleanor's universe. The world of school buses, lockers and dusty halls rushed back, though it's been many years since that time. Rainbow Rowell's pacing and movement kept me in the drama and danger of the situation, and reminded me of my own emotions during that period.  I loved the contrast between the main characters, and seeing each other through their eyes.  The last page came much too soon.  I hope teens and anyone with a teenage child will consider reading this moving story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you liked the first book you've got to read this one! This is a great book for all you teens and young adults out there!! I couldn't put it down and sat up all night to read it!! I was crying the whole time.
1107699894|5.0|In order to Learn English is very essential to have a good teacher and this book is one of it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you liked the first and second books then read this one. I was crying all night long as I read it, it was that good!!
0521675804|5.0|This book is the principal base in order to learn English, I use this grammar because I need to improve it and it is a good opportunity to share with other people around the work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the book for all you teens and young adults out there!! I couldn't put it down and sat up all night long reading it! It will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|this is definitely a Die Hard movie, personally I rate it right up there with Die Hard 3, good action, good special effects, and lots of bad guys getting what they deserve.<br /><br />no its not going to be a good movie for some people, but as a dick flick it works, its entertaining.<br /><br />I leave the rest of the stuff to the critics.<br /><br />I guess if you don't like die hard then don't watch them, but if you do you'll be happy with this one.<br /><br />just so you know my rating scale:<br />Die Hard 4 is the best so far<br />Die hard 1 is classic<br />Die hard 3 & 5 are next<br />Die hard 2 is OK.<br /><br />from reading the other reviews I figure I am a minority.... again.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The plot is the best you never know whats coming next. The series is the best once you start one season you never wat to stop
B004QYTRRS|5.0|Love Johnny.He's such a fun & good actor.A little crazy,a little cookie but that's what makes HIM...him.This is a great & adventurous movie.Lots of interesting twists & turns.Angelina is sexier than ever & really pulls off her character great.Got to watch it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game kept me interested for a good stretch of time and decent options to customize. I would recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|A little confused????? I was thinking this was the end of the series but I guess not. The mystery has got me hooked. Can't wait for the next book.
B000W746GK|5.0|Excellent movie<br />This helps to complete the series on DVD instead of the VCR version. Maybe this will last longer with repeated watching.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A must read and though I enjoyed the first book very much, this one blew me away! And my next thing to do is buy the next book in the series!
B00271DNP4|5.0|Excellent movie<br />this movie helps to complete the collection of Harry Potter movies on DVD<br />a movie for repeated watching
B009YP9L7U|5.0|What didn't I love about this book?  From page one, I was hooked.  Connor and Megan were easily likable characters and their chemistry was super, sizzling hot.  Ms. Kelly does a fabulous job amping up the emotion as well, and I felt every bit of angst her characters felt.  Also, Connor was just plain yummy.  Mira Lyn Kelly is now an auto-buy on my list!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The title makes this kinds self - explanatory but I will do this anyway. I just bought this game and it is absolutely the best! It's a bit similar to other games I have played but there is more creativity involved. There are several different, I guess, \\"characters\\" in the game and they all do different things. This, and many other things, make the game unique from all others. This game is great to pass time or to just have some strategic fun. And it's free! That alone should make you want to buy Pudding Monsters! Buy it now. No regrets. All fun.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|So disappointed that this trilogy is no longer a trilogy, but a series.  I feel completely deceived and not happy that there was no advance warning.  When you pay 9.99 for a book and read it with the expectation that you'll read the conclusion, and hopefully a happy ending, there is such a sense of frustration to find out it continues...unnecessarily!  I liked Eva and Gideon's story as the MAIN characters.  However this book does not focus on them, instead the secondary characters are what the the author is trying to develop in the 3rd book to prolong the series, and make more money.  The storyline with Brett Kline seems weak and only plays out in a couple of spots in the 2nd and 3rd book, making it seem like his character and storyline is a filler.  Same goes for Megumi, the receptionist where Eva works.  The worst is the new intern Will.  His character is a complete joke as they talk about what he's eating and craving...WHO CARES?  There were a lot of times I read the book and felt like Eva just observed random things happening throughout her day that had no relevance to the storyline, other than to take up space on paper.<br /><br />While I don't want to knock the author since it is obvious she is capable of writing good material, it's hard not to.  Whether she decided to prolong the story for profits, or the publishing house asked her to do it, the bottom line is she went along with it.  Out of respect for her work and her loyal readers it should have never been considered. Quality over quantity!  The one POSITIVE for me is that after I read this I was so frustrated I had to read something else to take my mind off my disappointment.  What I found was my justification for my review on this book and my thoughts about the author. I came across a book called Beauty from Pain by Georgia Cates.  This book was followed by a sequel called Beauty from Surrender.  Both books were wonderful and the icing on the cake came at the end of the second book. The author added notes that she had received so many requests to add a third book and continue Laurelyn and Jack's story (the main characters).  However, she felt good about where their story had ended and decided to end it at the second book.  She included that she may write a novella to please all the readers that requested a third book, but also wanted to please the people that loved where the story ended.  This is where Sylvia Day could take some notes.  Integrity over ambition or profits!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Works just fine but I have trouble with all connections of this typ as it does not indicate proper position of  male & female connections
B00CW665VI|5.0|Bloody brilliant!<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I honestly cannot recall reading a book where the book starts from a male's point-of-view. Sure, I've read books where the male's point-of-view is like a follow-up book in the series or where it is intertwined between the chapters of the book, but for it to be solely starting out a series from a man's prospective, fantastic!<br /><br />I laughed so freakin' hard in certain areas of this book and then in others, I felt the true pain that Drew was experiencing and all the inner turmoil he was experiencing. It was brilliant!<br /><br />I will admit, I was hesitant to start this book based on some of the reviews I read but I have to tell ya, for those of you that rated this book anything less than 4 stars, you should be ashamed.<br /><br />It was a sexy love story and it was refreshing having the book entirely from a man's prospective. Offering tips and hints along the way; it was great.
193700788X|1.0|I started reading the Southern Vampire series twelve years ago, and I truly enjoyed the first few books. I thought it was a fresh and exciting take on vampires, shifters, etc. Light and fun reading.<br /><br />However, as the years went by I noticed a disturbing trend in the later books in the series, that I chalked up to \\"author fatigue\\". Which brings us to this review I am writing.<br /><br />The fact is, this book is very poorly written: it's riddled with continuity errors, bad plotlines, the pacing is off, and the point of view is hopelessly off as well. It is abundantly clear that the author basically threw something together that lacked everything I've ever enjoyed about her writing to date. It was extremely disappointing to say the least.<br /><br />I probably could have dealt with the above problems if there had been a somewhat satisfying payoff to the storyline. Alas, there was no such payoff. The ending is as horrible as the rest of it. Supposedly there is another book in the works (After Dead) to tie up the rest of the loose ends and \\"what happened after the last book\\". As someone who has supported this author by buying her books for all these years and recommending some of them to other people, I feel obligated to say that she was a decent writer once, with a lot of potential but something apparently went very wrong somewhere. Very sad to see.<br /><br />Save your money. Get it from the library if you must read it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|The percentage icon seems to follow the actual power used. A photo heavy site compared to a plain text site. Easier to completely cycle your battery. I like it.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|The more I listen the more I love... It's another great album from them. Same great style but all new melodies...
B0050SYS5A|2.0|With Nike + Training Game, don´t recognize my wife and son. I configure any time in Xbox and kinect don´t works.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I love it. No one sounds like VW and it's a very unique style. I enjoy the different range each song has.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I have to say that this was a good book. Frustrating at times you just want to smack Abby and Travis up side the head sometimes.
B006470HZ6|1.0|every person that gets killed in this show gets killed because they do something so freaking stupid that their removal from the gene pool is simply a blessing.<br /><br />i hate shows that rely on stupidity of their characters to maintain a plot line.
098478280X|5.0|This book was a huge help to me in getting my new job!  I read every chapter and worked though most of the practice problems.  When interview day came, there were no surprises and I felt very well-prepared for everything that was asked of me.<br /><br />I can also recommend the associated videos as additional excellent preparation.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love that I can listen to news and talk from all over the globe. Plus I can hear music from my hometown and anywhere else.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun. love this app. I play at least 15times a day. to much advertisement throw the game but other than that. great
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I like this one. Great actors, some humor, plenty of action, decent enough plot, well paced. Date movie? Could be. Viewing with spouse? Yes as limited foul language or blood splatter. Male only viewing? Yes. Decent enough acting job by Bruce.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Good movie overall. SOOOO much action! I didn't like this one as much as the previous movies but it still manages to be worthwhile to watch. I recommend watching this if you are a fan of the other Die Hard movies. Don't set your sights too high and you'll like it.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I have truly enjoyed all 3 books regarding Eva and Gideon aka Angel and Ace.  I hope it is not over.  There must be at least one more coming.  I was happy with where the love affair went in Etwined.  I just want the Nathan issue resolved and hope that Nathan was really alive when Gideon left him in Reflected.  Surely it will be discovered in next book that Gideon did not kill him.  So so good.  I would like to see Gideon be relieved of the nightmares so he and Eva can spend the entire night in bed without him being on medication.  All 3 books are worth the price.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I've loved his music for years and he just gets better and better.  The old standard sound with his slightly modern twist keeps the music fresh without sacrificing that feeling of &#34;they don't make music like this anymore&#34;  Lucky for us, Michael Buble does.
1932907009|5.0|This is a great starting point. I am working on several projects and this book really helped clear the way for some organized creativity (I know, that sounds goofy). The only problem is that I started deconstructing movies, even shows my 2 year old is watching.
B00847KFDS|4.0|If you like his music, this is a fun cd to listen too.  Saw John at Stagecoach Festival in Indio California and he put on the best show of all the singers/musicians.  Everyone was on their feet the entire time.  Liked he has other singers on the cd. I purchased one for a friend also and they love it.  I'd buy it again.
B009NY43NY|5.0|All of the books have been great, it's filled with action, suspense and mystery. Once I start the book I can't put it down, it's just too good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is good for keeping your mind challenged. It makes you think before proceeding. It is amazing to look and see what the outcome will be before you make the moves.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved Orphan Train. It's the first book I've read in a long time that I couldn't put down. I ignored all but the most essential duties around the house for three days. I cried  for the characters & was sad when the book ended & I had to leave them behind.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|This movie is one-of-a-kind. a lot of good information and great acting.<br />I really like this movie!! thumbs up. :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Man this game is so fun cant stop playing it since I got it. I think everyone should try this at least once.
0375869026|5.0|A great book for a new middle schooler (Johnny age 11).  It teaches readers about differences and tolerance and friendships.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I recommend this ap for anyone with a Kindle. Gives very good info with just a tap from your stylus!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I wish more levels were available already.  I fun play, a bit tricky at times though.  Comparable to 100 floors though more in depth.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|A fun summer read that feels different from most zombie stories.  Less about the horror aspect and more on the impact this sort of fight would have on people and the world.  The global perspective is nice but lack of a central character kept me from feeling invested in anyone.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game is highly addictive.  It's a good thing you only get so many lives or you'd play for hours. lol
0765325950|4.0|Like 2 sides of the coin, the good and  bad feature about the saga is the extensive detailed descriptions, and irrelevant secondary characters. About this book in particular, I'm biased. I love Jordan's work and I think Sanderson was up to the task. I'd have liked to know more about the characters as an epilogue and read less about the fighting. Anyway, nobody is perfect. Whether the elements of the story as a whole are original is unimportant. I seek entertainment and I got it. Hope you enjoy it too.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|As usual with a Baldacci read, the characters are well developed, the plot intricate, the resolution satisfying. The large negative for me is the amount of innocent deaths, the collateral damage which brings home to us how violent the world can be. I read to escape, not get a recap of the daily news in story form.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Such a fun game but everything cost so much. Graphics are beautiful and clear. Just wish things cost less or u made more peanuts and coins.
B00AEBBA0Y|5.0|It is a great adventure comedy! Steve Zahn in particular is quite funny in this movie. His dry humor is hilarious. Plus you can't go wrong with Matthew McConaughey & the lovely Penélope Cruz. If you find this cheap get it. It sure to make you laugh.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Absolutely an amazing story. Hooking you beyond belief with an needing that has you screaming \\"WHAT?!\\" You will bot be disappointed.
0061950726|4.0|Book was very good.  A little depressing. I never realized there was such a train for. Orphan children.  How sad
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I loved it...the book was beautifully written and eerie...I explain the concept of the book to my parents and I got chills from the tip of my hairs to my toes...it was a beautiful book and in my opinion a movie should be made...
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Le Carres' s typical convoluted presentation makes a fine read . His characters are so very British and proper much to the pleasure of any Anglophile. A bit long but worth the time investment.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|The game was super fun the only thing about it that such a pain is that you end up having to buy it to keep playing the adventure mode which is 1.99 so it's not really free but if like it the money is worth it . In the end it's just a teaser.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Kiera captures the true spirit of a young girl. She is emotional and confused about love just like we all were at 17.  An excellent continuation of the story. Can't wait for the next book!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I wanted a case for my Kindle that met my requirements and was not very expensive. I wanted the case to have slots for my charger and my earphones, I wanted decent protection, I wanted my kindle to &#34;wake up&#34; or &#34;go to sleep&#34; when I closed or opened the cover, and I wanted the case to be cheap. (less than 30 dollars.) This case met everyone of those requirements. My only complaint is that when the cover is closed the charging slot is covered. The case has to be open in order to charge my kindle. Not a big problem, though. Overall, I love this case. I would reccomend this case to someone who does not want to spend a lot of money on a case and does not drop their Kindle frequently. (Frequently meaning one or twice every week.)
B001EBV0NU|5.0|Very funny and strange! Lots of stars and strange happenings. Not too realistic, thank goodness. Good one to watch with the family.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love the game. And my 5 year old does to.<br />It's fun and it easy to learn. I would tell all my friends to download it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have no idea why people are complaining so much about this book... It is AMAZING!! I loved it as much as i did with BTY, which is A LOT!!! I'm more in love with Gideon as ever...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series was one of the best that I have ever read you are a fabulous tighter and thank you for weighting these books
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This was an interesting and enjoyable read! Was very happy that I purchased it.  I would recommend it to a friend!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The acting is very, very good. The plot is straightforward and keeps you anticipating while you are enthralled with the events taking place.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I loved this movie Nick Nolte gave a great proformence as the father. He has not been in to many movies lately but this movie clearly show he is still an A list actor. I loved this movie the story was amazing, with pleanty of gray area too be explored as the movie got better. The fight scenes were real and beleavable and the acting was to. This is one of my top ten movies now. Dont pass this movie up. Watch it.
B00962UJ22|5.0|I've always had a kind of love/hate relationship with progressive rock.  I often loved its structure, complexity and virtuosity until someone would begin to sound as snobby about it as classical music fans often do to me.  Because, I like Sam the Sham, too!<br /><br />As many albums as I have and as long as I've been listening/collecting, I had missed Anglagard's previous work.  When this one began showing up on lists of new albums and I began reading old fan's excitement about a new work from them, I took advantage of youtube and had a chance to listen to the entire album there.  Wow!<br /><br />Yes, sometimes prog rock goes a bit too far for me....toward pretension.  Here, the music was quite enveloping.  It is, no doubt, one of my favorite albums of the year and that's among over 350 that I've listened to.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I read the books ages ago and it was so fun to see the worlds I'd read about coming to life.  More dark than I expected but I think that was my own failing rather than being theirs.
B0095P29EG|3.0|It was an ok flm in that I did watch it to the end. I am sure it would be good for youngsters but mature adults would find it just acceptable for entertainment
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|After reading the books ages ago I thought this may be too bloody for me.  Make no mistake, there is gore but it's somehow woven into the story and, to me, is therefore more palatable.  And a bit easier to avoid by averting your eyes.  Great dialogue.
B005P89F1C|5.0|If you love Justin Bieber, you'll love this cd. There are some old classics as well as newer songs. I love his version of Silent Night, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, and The Christmas Song. His duet Home this Christmas is beautiful and really heartfelt if you're missing someone this Christmas.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|I loved it. The acting was amazing , and i have a great love for all gangster movies, robert de niro was amazing.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|Pop music hides people's voices. If you want to hear the REAL Justin Bieber, listen to this CD. It shows his raw talent and singing ability. You might like him personally, but there's no denying his talent when you hear him sing on this album.
B0083EM24C|5.0|We listen to this cd all the time. It is great for long road trips. I recommend this cd for anyone who likes music like imagine dragons.
B003XPCID6|5.0|If  you love old Bieber, you HAVE to have this CD. It's got a lot of fun songs on here and I love jamming to it in the car or while at work.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like it because it covers my local weather and I get to see the weather for the next 10 days.  It sure helps when planning anything outdoors (like yard work.....)
B00B4804KS|4.0|In this 1993 film re-released in 3D, two experts are brought in to evaluate a retreat that a wealthy man is building. The retreat is the result of bringing back dinosaurs. Predictably, the unpredictable happens, as the dinos wreak havoc on the visitors. This exciting and intense film is not necessarily enhanced by the 3D effect, but is still quite good twenty years later. The visual effects used to portray the dinosaurs were revolutionary at the time, and are still awe-inspiring to see. If you want the kids to see how excitement at the movies was generated two decades ago, take them to see Jurassic Park.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have had facebook on my computer for a long time.  Now it is so handy to check on friends and relatives while out and about.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|In this prequel to the TWOO, a young magician from Kansas finds himself transported to Oz, and is mistaken for the great wizard they have been waiting for. He befriends a flying monkey dressed as a bellboy (don't ask) and a porcelain doll. These characters are quite funny and cute, and are good assets to the film. The three witch sisters he meets, two good, one bad (You'll know which one is bad) are portrayed by excellent actresses. Overall the movie is cute, but not too cute, and has some light moments. This is one the kids will definitely enjoy, and parents will be entertained.
0393061310|5.0|Jared Diamond's book, Guns, Germs and Steel, is one of the most expansive and exploratory<br />works in regard to human history and the \\"progress\\" experienced by certain cultures over time.<br />Diamond was once asked by a man in Papua, New Guinea, about the \\"cargo\\" that white man<br />amassed and also took from his native country in the form of resources such as sandlewood.  At<br />first, Dr. Diamond thought his answer to the question would be simple and easily explained.  It<br />wasn't until he truly paused to consider the depth and implications of such a question, that he<br />embarked on a project to find out why certain societies have progressed technologically while<br />others struggle along with the same tools and procurement systems for hundreds of years.<br />  Diamond disregarded any notions of genetic inferiority to explain why certain cultures, such<br />as the ones in New Guinea, don't progress technologically in step with other societies.  Having<br />visited Papua, New Guinea, to study birds originally, he became friendly with many New<br />Guineans and formed an appreciation for their encyclopedic knowledge of their environment<br />when it came to basic survival skills such as hunting and gathering.  He determined that any idea<br />of genetic ineptitude was completely off the mark.  Instead, he noted that he wouldn't last a day<br />in their environment without their help.  Impressed by their knowledge and skill, he was further<br />moved to find the reasons why they lagged behind in technology while other cultures, such<br />ancient Egyptians, found ways to build massive pyramids and other complex structure.<br />  Part of what Diamond determined, during his exploration, is that highly stratified and<br />\\"technologically advanced\\" societies had some things in common.  A well organized work force<br />was one of the things that advanced societies needed to complete massive projects such as large-<br />scale irrigation and granaries.  Another component, and most important, was where people lived<br />on the planet.  Jared Diamond concluded that a culture's geography, and more specifically, their<br />  2<br />latitude, played a very important role in determining their technological fate.<br />  His theory was bold and thought to be too deterministic by some.  However, he plodded on the<br />piece together what he thought was the answer to the question he was asked by the Papua, New<br />Guinean.  Depending on your geographical location, you might enjoy crops that where easily<br />stored, such as wheat, that would feed more people in a burgeoning population.  Diamond<br />considered the first farmers on the planet that inhabited the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East.<br />Climate change engendered a new way of life for inhabitants of the region.  Hunting and<br />gathering is time consuming, difficult and unable to feed a stratified society such as ancient<br />Egypt.  In order to support specialists in your society, you need to have a reliable food source<br />and method of procurement.<br />  As farming societies grew in the Neolithic Era, more people were freed from the burden of<br />food getting.  Agricultural societies were able, in other words, to support non-food producers to<br />do such things as carpentry, artistry or academic work.  Diamond's theory asserted, in part, that<br />modern technological advances would not be possible without the advent of horticulture and<br />eventually, intensive agriculture.  Societies such as the ones still found in Papua, New Guinea,<br />have been farming for over 40,000 years but have not progressed technologically like the rest of<br />the developed world.<br />  Diamond found that the plants and animals at their disposal, determined by their latitude, did<br />not allow for specialists.  When everyone has to be involved with procuring food, it leaves little<br />time to invent or discover new technologies.  New Guineans couldn't not grow cereal grasses such<br />as wheat and barely that could be easily cultivated and stored.  Instead, they were relegated to a<br />sparse variety of plants that were not easily harvested or stored.  Additionally, they did not have<br />the beasts of burden that European cultures had relied on to progress throughout human history.<br /><br />  3<br />Diamond determined that only a handful of animals had ever been successfully domesticated<br />over time and New Guineans did not have any of these species such as oxen or horses.<br />  Ultimately, Dr. Jared Diamond concluded that geography was the single most important<br />factor in determining a culture's technological capacity and potential.  His scholarship also proves<br />that there are no biological grounds for racism or prejudice.
B00CFA222M|4.0|A young man encounters a monk who gives him some beans purported to be magical. Upon one of them sprouting, he follows a beanstalk to rescue a beautiful princess from a land of giants. This was a really entertaining and fun film that caters to adults and the PG-13 set, rather than young children. The giants are menacing and ugly, the personalities of them are unique and visuals of them are terrific. The princess is someone that any man would risk his life to save and the action is non-stop. This film was quite a bit of fun.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I have tried more than 10 times to get it and even looks OK, when I start playing it appears a window saying &#34;it is not working&#34; and that is frustrating since I really love this game
B008JFUNYG|1.0|A group of young people gather at a family cabin for an outing. One of them reads from a book that unleashes a demon. The demon possesses them individually, and death ensues. There is not much mystery in this one, other than who will die next, and how bad will it look. That, and why five twenty-somethings are spending a weekend together, and not one of them has a cell phone. If you are looking to be frightened or scared, this is not the movie for you.  I don't think this movie is for anyone, actually, as it really brings nothing to the table.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like it but it would be good if you can get small awards basically for children under 6.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|The crew of the Starship Enterprise is back and they are dealing with Khan, a bad guy who has it in for Captain Kirk and his crew. Kirk disobeys orders, creating a rift with Spock, who cannot lie on an official report. I was surprised at how funny this movie was. The writers included some very clever lines, and that is always a plus in a film with this much action and intensity. Into Darkness does not necessarily stand out as a superior entry in the genre, but the exciting, big-budget, visually stimulating film certainly is good enough to warrant a day at the movies.
B00785P2QC|3.0|it would be interesting if you could see examples of how to play with it and change complexity considering age
B005LAII44|3.0|The elite Joe's are attacked by their own, and a few survivors must determine why the President ordered the assault. They team with a former foe to fight a mutual enemy. If this sounds like fun, it is, sort of. The highlight of the film other than the 3D effect, which enhances the visuals, is the terrific chemistry of its stars, which prevents it from being a very ordinary action film. The Rock is good in everything he does, and Bruce Willis provides a bit of humor to the film. Not too much different from other explosion-filled action movies you've seen, a good bit of casting helps this one
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Great movie had been wanting to get the directors cut for a bit adds a bit more to the film
B008JFUO36|4.0|A team of operatives are on an unlivable earth, wrecked by nuclear war after an alien invasion. They are tasked with maintaining the probes that seek out to kill the alien scavengers that are left. The remaining human population is on a space station away from the planet. This interesting film has a storyline ....well let's stop there to avoid any spoilers. The visuals in the film are splendid, but not overdone. Other than that, I will simply say that this film will surprise you, and keep you entertained for two hours.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series warms your soul. I loved the development of the characters in each episode.<br />Each had their goodness and weaknesses.
B00CHVIPP2|4.0|A family in the cavemen days survives by staying mostly isolated in caves. The daughter meets a young man who predicts a global calamity that comes true. They all try to flee to a safe place. This is an animated effort that, though not among the elite of its genre, is funny and entertaining. Some of the humor is directed at the adults in the audience, as when the patriarch of the family would like to rid the unit of his mother-in-law. Good animation and funny jokes are enough to make this one enjoyable for both kids and parents.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I absolutely love this app enjoy spending time playing have even made it a family event on many occasions, kids enjoy playing it as much as I do
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Two young boys in small town Arkansas befriend a strange man who appears to be in hiding. They help him make seaworthy an abandoned boat, so that he can get out of the small town. One boy deals with personal issues of girls and divorce while assisting the man elude those who pursue him. Another home run for Matthew McConaughey, this film combines grief, action, and compelling drama in one package that will certainly hold your attention for its two-plus hour duration. The heartthrob actor shows his acting chops in this one, forgoing leading man status (not to mention a shower) to portray a desperate man on the run. This is one of the finest dramatic efforts of the year.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game so cool if I can play but all day I would that how much u love this game I hope they may a subway surfers 2 so i can play that one :^)
B008JFUMDS|2.0|A foursome of magicians are brought together for the purpose of performing elaborate magic tricks, which include robbing a bank.  As the film progresses, it is apparent that there is more to the plan than stealing money. This movie has one of the most unlikely story lines I have ever seen. The entertainment value of the film is almost enough to recommend it, but upon further review, it has been determined that the movie's ludicrous scenario is just too much to overcome.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Very very different.  I loved the end section so much I read that portion over and over.  Recommended to friends and gave this book as gifts.
B0067EKYS6|2.0|Based on the classic novel, this is the story of a friendship that develops between J. Gatsby and his neighbor. Gatsby is a mysterious figure known for lavish parties and a significant life story. This effort by director Baz Luhrmann is heavy on the visuals while being light on the storytelling, and the drama. The movie is like a birthday gift that is wrapped beautifully, but when opened, nothing much is there. It certainly looks extravagant, but the film is too long, and it does not do justice to one of the great American stories ever told.
B0002BO05S|5.0|Again, I wanted this classic film for my library!  Very good quality, this is definitely a must have film to keep.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Iron Man is back, and this time he is fighting a terrorist who is trying to destroy everything he loves. Iron Man goes to battle against this foe, trying to save not only innocent civilians, but his own way of life. This movie is an improvement over the second in the series, but does not stand up to the quality of the first. It does have quite a bit of excitement, which is certainly a requirement for an action film, but otherwise does not really bring anything special to the genre. The visual effects are terrific, and the top-notch actors attached to the film help to elevate its quality. This is not one of the best action films of late, but for a little summer escapism, you could do worse than Iron Man 3.
B003BV8I3Q|5.0|I already had the documentry.  So this film really adds as a reference to back it up. The movie is of excellent quality and another must have for your collection.
B008JFUP0I|4.0|The sixth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise is upon us, and it does not disappoint. The team is recruited to track down a guy, who has a team of his own, and he is trying to steal a weapon that would threaten many, but does the identity of the bad guy really matter? What matters are fast cars, fast women, great stunts, and explosions, of which the film has plenty. It's amazing how well this franchise has held up, unlike some others (see The Hangover).  Fasten your seat belt and be ready for a wild ride.
B00849F82E|5.0|Out of everything that I have ever read, this is the book that I have recommended to the most people. My friends and roommates hated me when I read it because I would continuously stop and read passages out loud to them. There was never a dull moment in the entire thing.<br /><br />I think the reason that this writing is so powerful is that he makes it so personal, without moving away from logical or reasonable arguments. He sets up the extended metaphor of an explorer that sets out to find new lands, but ends up \\"discovering\\" England, where people have been for thousands of years. He is the explorer, telling the tale of his personal search for truth, and Orthodox Christianity is the new land, having already been established thousands of years in the past.<br /><br />I went to pull a quote from the book for a talk that I was working on, got sidetracked, and found myself two hours later having reread a huge portion of it over again.<br /><br />Please read this. If you don't like it I will let you punch me in the face as hard as you want.
B008JFUORW|2.0|The Wolfpack is back, and they are on a mission to save one of their friends, who has been kidnapped. They must track down Chow, and return gold that he stole in order to save Doug. This final film in the trilogy is a slight improvement over the annoying second film, but there is not enough here to completely redeem it. They play the character idiosyncrasies for as many laughs as they can, and a cameo by Melissa McCarthy is mostly wasted, as this one just does not stand up to the crazy original. Part III is not terrible, but it is not very good, either.
B000JMLDCS|5.0|Out of everything that I have ever read, this is the book that I have recommended to the most people. My friends and roommates hated me when I read it because I would continuously stop and read passages out loud to them.

B00BUAEYVK|3.0|Bruce Willis is back and is trying to connect with his estranged son. His son is in Russia, and is not there on vacation. The two end up teaming together on the mission that he is participating in. This one combines action and humor just like the others in the series, and the formula succeeds once again, though to a lesser extent. The story takes an unexpected turn that keeps the film interesting. This may be the weakest entry yet in the series, but it is still a good time at the movies
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book from beginning to end! the author was able to bring out a variety of emotions through text while highlighting mental health.<br /><br />A MUST READ
B00AZMFO6I|2.0|At a home for retired singers and musicians, and group of friends are preparing for a show. A new woman arrives, and this provides some tension for one of the men at the home. The new arrival is invited to join them in the show. Filled with veterans of stage and screen, this film caters to an older audience, who may appreciate the music and the story of these elderly people who are living in a retirement home. Young people may not like it so much, as the operatic music and the storyline are not necessarily that appealing to the gen-x and younger demographic.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|We received everything on time. It seemed like the package was here in a blink of the eye and as promised and everything was package correctly. The product looks great and my son really likes his new toy. Thank you...this was a good business experiences :-)
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think it is great for long car rides. but they really would come out faster with updates. I mean I have been waiting for about a week just for one update.
B009AMANBA|5.0|We received the product on time. It was packaged securely as promised. The product wasn't damaged or scratched; it was like or brand new. The product looks great! Thank you...this was a good business experiences :-)
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|Everything about this album, from the artwork to the lyrics. I was pleasantly surprised with this. I liked Black Gives Way to Blue, but this is on a whole different level. We finally start to see Cantrell and DuVall show off their own respective vocal style rather than trying to emulate Layne or sing entire songs in harmony.<br />There's not a single song on this record that I dislike. I like certain songs more than others, but I don't dislike any of them. I can't say the same for BGWtB, and I really can't say the same for one or two of the Layne-era albums, either.<br />After playing through the album two or three times, I noticed I started to enjoy it more and more each time through. I'm on my 5th play-through. I'm proud of AIC. Really. I came into this expecting a decent album, but likely wouldn't hold up to any comparison to their early albums or EPs. I was wrong. I'm blown away. Does it shine brightly above all other works? No. But it's much closer to that level, in my opinion. That's my take on it.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|Very good music. Very good band and filling.. a exelent performance and in general I<br />Love their music. A good purchase.
B004EQAVFU|4.0|I enjoyed this film, but if you want to see a happy, uplifting film, god, this is not it!!! It's a good film though, with great performances, especially from Andrew Garfield.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|What more can be said -- it snaps on the end of the older MagSafe charger and the fits fine on my MacBook Air.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a really great story.  There is a lot of technical jargon that made little sense to me but that did not detract from a great story.  It could have been a potentially long and boring story but the author made the lead character so very interesting and enjoyable that I could not put the book down.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is that the Kindle edition has several grammatical errors that made reading at times a pain.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is super addictive and fun. Definitely download! The tutorial is very helpful if you don't know how to play!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Ok I don't know what to rate this app mostly beacause I don't have it. but it is totally not fair that it is 6.00! At least.make it a free app of the day. Thurston me it would be good for sales. and I would totally buy it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Was the best book I've ever read and defiantly can't wait to read losing hope! I loved the twist the novel took with all the emotions
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great film on all levels! Best I've watched in a very long time. Would absolutely recommend.  Definitely will not disappoint.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love this app! Works great! Let's me know when my battery is running low, and I would suggest that you get this as well!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like it because it has a lot of action and very good description.  I think that I will read this book over an over and start the second book tight now.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|It seems harder to use than my computer E Bay. The tabs fod looking at things work slower than just scrolling down.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|How could you not love Dexter? Very entertaining. We have to pace ourselves otherwise we would watch the season all in one weekend.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Down loaded it because it was free, This is not necessary on my fire as their battery gauge is just fine,
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this game it is the best ,their is amazing graphics and cool effects it is the best yet their is.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really like this app  but I can not figure out how to update I have heard about updating to get 0.7.0
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|'After Earth' is a waste of a decent looking spacecraft thanks to bad acting, nonexistent humor, weak/annoying plot, and a cringe-worthy moody-symphonic 'oh-this-is-such-drama' soundtrack through the entire production. Bleh.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|omg this is very entertaining and its great to play anywhere its very challenging and ifiyour annoyed play this it works i did it
B0045HCJ9E|4.0|North by Northwest is Alfred Hitchcock at his best.<br />It has a great cast, good suspense with many twists and turns. An enjoyable film.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Definitely not for the squeamish. Change only came with blood, violence, and death (which seems to be the case for humans at almost any time in history) but if you want an involving drama with an accurate historical framework that is interested in portraying Vikings in a more intimate light, this is it.
B001DF68MA|5.0|bought this when bell rear seat got too small. My 2 year old loves that he can see everything and not stuck staring at dads bum. Highly recommend.  you may have to adjust your riding strides due to placement. Easy install within 20 minutes.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I would give 3.5 stars - I finished it and enjoyed it but I wouldn't rate it as an all time favorite.  A nice book - and was available from my library on kindle.
B009X01FJS|5.0|Couldn't be happier,it fits my needs perfectly.  Durable and fits great Lovethefel of inside and outside as well  would recommend
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not into sadism or bondage.making love is one thing canes whips  instruments of torture remind me of man.. muff said.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|I think many Harry Potter fans will notice the name Nicolas Flamell. When I first looked at it I didn't look like a great book, but then I started reading it and I started liking more and more. I guess I can say, \\"Don`t judge a book by it`s cover!!!\\" If you want to know the real story of Nicolas Flamell read the author's note. It contains surprising amount of information!!!!
B004KRQFI0|5.0|Bought as gift for my brother because he asked for it.  No complaints from him, so no news is good news!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really enjoyed the story and it kept my interest.  Very quick read.  Like these types of novels, kind of scifi stuff.  Looking forward to more novels of this type.  Great read.
B005HS00NW|5.0|Best listened to with no other distractions, over and over.  Each time you listen to it you hear something you missed before.  *Then* go watch the Youtube video, and you'll find yourself hearing it in a whole new way again.
0439023513|3.0|Good enough story until you realize where its going, then you want to just skip ahead and get it over with.<br />Still, if you read the first two take the time for this one.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|Bought as a gift for my brother because he asked for it.  No complaints from him, so no news is good news!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I don't know how to write a review about this book, without spoiling anything for you who haven't read it yet and are eager to do so.<br />I loved the hero, Nalini Singh made him come alive to me.<br />I felt so much for the heroine, and what she has endured. She trusted him without her memory, even though her mind kept doubting him and his motives, her heart knew better.<br />Their lovestory is truly epic, and what they have suffered because of it, is horrible.<br />Her love literally saves the world ...<br /><br />And yes, the Ghost is revealed. And I was wrong in who I thought it was. I totally did not mind being wrong.<br /><br />I enjoyed the short interactions with the Changelings, but this time the book focuses mainly on the Psy, and what is happening in the Psy Net and the world.<br /><br />What can I say? I loved it, go out, buy it, and read it. It is just sooo good.<br /><br />10 stars.<br /><br />© 2013 Reviews by Aurian<br /><br />Full review on my blog, www.boeklogboek.blogspot.com
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|A funny thing happened when I was trolling around Amazon, trying to decide which rather pricy two-episode set I should buy of Commissario Montalbano (my favourite Italian detective), when somehow--not sure how--I stumbled on the complete series of \\"Columbo\\" at half price. \\"Why not?\\" I thought. \\"For old times' sake! What does it matter if the series is a bit old fashioned?\\"<br /><br />Well, about the only old-fashioned thing about this quality detective series are the cars which, rather appropriately, resemble huge moving coffins (I am, of course, overlooking the telephones, the hairstyles and other tell-tale signs of the 'seventies). Having watched only the first four episodes, so far, I am happy as a couple of clams, and I cannot believe my luck at having acquired such a great pearl at so little a price.<br /><br />So what's to love in these mysteries that are not so much \\"Who-Done-It?\\" as \\"How-Done-It?\\" Well, just about everything. I love the subtle comedy--Columbo, for instance, fumbling about in the background, dropping things or fiddling with his cigar, trying to find a match, or a pen--as the slick murderer, whose arrogance is his/her undoing, becomes increasingly irritated, while Columbo--the eternal schlub--inevitably closes in. I also love the touches of surrealism (for instance, watching the coverup of the murder take place through the reflection of Robert Culp's glasses--and I can hardly wait for the episode in which Columbo--closing in on a homicidal artist--becomes part of the painting).<br /><br />The casts are simply to die for. In addition to Peter Falk's underplayed over-playing of the title role, we have A-list actors, including Culp, Ray Milland, Lee Grant for starters), and the various guest directors (including Stephen Spielberg) are splendid, as are the opulent settings. The murderers always come from the top drawer of wealth, and it is so much fun to watch them being brought low by the scruffy Lieutenant Columbo, who, pestering them with \\"just one more thing,\\" drives all the villains to the point of distraction, before he closes in on them.<br /><br />In abstract terms, Columbo portrays the triumph of the little man over the great and powerful, a potent image in tough economic times. In concrete terms, Columbo rewards the viewer with pure enjoyment and entertainment: the gold standard of television that, unfortunately, seems to have vanished along with the economy.<br /><br />How lucky we are to have this collection!<br /><br />P.S. I have been watching this on my Blu-Ray player with progressed scan. The pictures and colour are excellent.one more thing,\\" drives all the villains to the point of distraction, before he closes in on them.<br /><br />In abstract terms, Columbo portrays the triumph of the little man over the great and powerful, a potent image in tough economic times.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a fun and enjoyable game with a variety of options to play. Not only do I have it on my kindle, I have it on my cellphone because I enjoy it that much.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished the Wool Omnibus in close to one sitting.  I was absolutely glued to my Nook to find out what happened to Juliette and her friends.  The plot was tense for the entire book and while Wool is set in a very bleak world, the undercurrent of hope was always maintained which is hard to do.  While I didn't think we got to know many of the characters, I definitely feel like the main ones were extremely well done and I did get an excellent feel for the society of the silo.  I don't want to give a spoiler, but I will say, while I expected one of the lines in the book, it still rocked me hard.  So much horror in one simple statement!  I've already got my hands on the other books and am eagerly looking forward to my free time.  Very well done!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This seems like it COULD be a nice game, but freezes a LOT. Does not always load properly. 1 in 5 games actually loads properly. Like I said it COULD be a nice game.

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best  of English TV series. Maggie Smith especially, but all the cast are superb.<br />The direction, editing, decor and music are very good and the various stories quite gripping.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|This album is just like the 3 before it. It has its moments of greatness. my personal favorite is off the edge. this album has a darker feel to it. if you like the the last three albums you should dig this one. It just might take a couple spins to sink in.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Seriously if you are a QoTsA fan then you know perfectly well to pick up this damn album since how can you say no? Absolutely amazing album, yes there is only ten songs but it is still worth it. GET IT NOW!<br />Oh yeah...now my wife is mad at me because I rather kick back on my favorite couch chair with $150 dollar headphones and listening to this album non-stop than give her attention. Seriously, it has been six years and right now my QoTsA needs attention because this album IS the sex. Also, wear headphones because it helps the nagging wife and annoying kids not bother you when you are listening to this album. Now excuse me while I re-listen to this album for the 32nd time like clockwork because QoTsA is the only reason why it's worth being alive today.
B00A757EFW|2.0|just did not care for the game at all.  maybe the younger kids would like it.  still like the orginal pac man
0425263924|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />As I sat here writing my review, the song Mirrors: Justin Timberlake came on, and it immediately made me think of Eva and Gideon's journey in finding their way back to each other and the realizations they must acknowledge in this book. The meaning behind the chorus of Mirrors was the perfect inspiration for basing my review on since it fits their relationship perfectly, especially after the torment they both endured in Reflected in You. Entwined with You picks up right where Reflected left off and focuses more on the aftermath of Eva and Gideon picking up the pieces and addressing the distressful memories and barriers that tore them apart in the first place.<br /><br />Reflected left me a little anxious and heartbroken when I finished it; I was nervous to see what direction Sylvia Day was going to take Eva and Gideon's relationship or lack thereof in Entwined with You. I became even more apprehensive to crack my book open after reading some mixed reviews, readers were not happy with the third edition and its outcome, but in my humble opinion, it was my favorite book yet! Although I would have loved a bit more at the end, I felt satisfied enough with their advancement that I can't wait for book 4 to release, so we can have more more of them.<br /><br />\\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry. I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life. I want to wake up to you like this every day forever. I want you. Goddamn it. Wait for me, Eva. I waited my whole life for you.\\"<br /><br />I loved every ounce of vulnerability Gideon gave us (we saw very little of this in the first two books, most of the vulnerability came from Eva) when it came to earning back Eva's trust and love. The vulnerability I saw in him snagged at my heart and kept me engaged as I absorbed major changes in his demeanor. It was something else watching such a strong, dominant, in control passionate man brought to his knees while his carefully built facade fell to pieces. Since Gideon shattered his relationship with Eva, he is left with no other choice but to lower his defenses and expose his soul to the one woman he would travel through hell and back for, and make no mistake Gideon traveled down that road. The thing is when it comes to Eva he feels no guilt in doing whatever it takes to make sure she is protected even if it means destroying both of them in the process. Now it is time for Gideon to face the consequences of his actions, even if they were in the purest light, and deal with the repercussions.<br /><br />\\"This -he gestured impatiently at himself-\\"is just a f****** shell. You're what drives me, Eva. Can you understand that? You're my heart and soul. If something ever happened to you, it would kill me, too. Keeping you safe is goddamned self-preservation! Tolerate it for me, if you won't do it for yourself.\\"<br /><br />Our bad boy broke our sassy independent heroine and while it is easy to forgive it is not always easy to forget which can cause hiccups in the process towards mending ones heart. Due to the multiple betrayals in Reflected their relationship suffered from the damage caused by Gideon's actions. It was so bad I wasn't sure how the heck they would come back from all that crazy. However, this is where I tell you, I think I fell even more in love with Eva, I may even have a slight girl crush on her. Gideon broke her, yes, but she was still the Eva we know and love. She matured in Entwined, her character found peace, inner happiness and balance. It showed in every action and word she used to handle Gideon. Not only did her character develop on a deeper level with Gideon I also saw development with her other personal relationships. It was a nice change to see Eva secure in the knowledge of who she was becoming and where she was going with her life.<br /><br />Gideon however, while I loved the changeswe started to see with his character, still has a bit more maturing to do though.<br /><br />Which brings us to the fact that Gideon and Eva finally have a relationship that is starting to resemble some form of stability and normalcy (who am I kidding, I should say normalcy to a certain extent however, the signs are there pointing towards this direction in the near future). Gideon and Eva had to fight so much harder this time around to overcome the wrong that was done. It was quite refreshing to see these two actually work through all of their issues using...wait for it...communication! Yes, you read that right; they actually talked things out, even the tough unpleasant subjects. That isn't to say they still didn't have a few issues with said communication, but it's a start right? I think for me because of this their character growth and chemistry was even more intense as they both navigated through emotionally sensitive territory that is so foreign in nature to them.<br /><br />\\"Your craving should be for me, angel, not an orgasm. For my body, my hands. Eventually, you won't be able to come without my skin touching yours.\\"<br /><br />These two are so beyond addicted to each other that it sometimes borders on dysfunctional. Eva and Gideon's relationship has to spin on the same axis otherwise if it takes even the slightest detour off this axis everything in their lives becomes a complete mess. I think this may be my favorite aspect of Gideon and Eva. No matter how messed up or flawed they are, they know there is absolutely no one else in this world for either of them. Their hearts are so entwined with each other that as their devotion and love grows stronger it leaves you captivated and breathless. And, this ladies makes for one h*** of a read.<br /><br />Overall, I loved Entwined with you and as I said earlier it is my favorite in this series so far but I have to admit I did have a few small irks throughout the book. It was nice visiting with one of my favorite couples again and Sylvia never disappoints when it comes to these two so these irks weren't big enough to take anything away from their story for me. Even the ending wasn't as bad as it seems, was it perfect, no. There were perfect parts to it and parts that made me shake my head, but it didn't bother me as much as others. I love the Crossfire series so I am excited to see them continue on. More Gideon, yeah I won't be arguing with that any time soon.<br /><br />Thanks to Sylvia Day and Sullivan and Partners for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review.

B0052REUW0|5.0|i'm motivated to write this review largely to help offset the unfair 1-star rating of the immediate predeccesor review - it's worth the full 5-stars i give it.  (most) other reviewers have done an excellent job, so i'm just going to throw in a couple of minor quibbles...<br /><br />the first is the author's reference to the phrase 'hydraulic theory of violence', by which is meant a build-up of violent feeling in an individual which (eventually) gets released in an uncontrolled spasm of violence (the author argues against this viewpoint).  my objection is that this term (whether the author's invention or simply repeated) is a terrible slander against the hugely important and useful field of hydraulics.  hydraulics is all about the CONTROLLED release of power.  it's a little late for this book, but for any academics in this area, for future use, i'll suggest the alternate phrase 'volcanic theory of violence' - this phrase is far more accurate, does not (i think) unfairly slander volcanos and even throws in a touch of alliteration as a bonus...please, no more \\"hydraulic violence\\".<br /><br />my second quibble will be more controversial...i should note as a prelude that i am not an American and likely would not have voted for George W. Bush if i were.  all the same, the author extends the near-universal left/Democratic slander against Mr. Bush, along the lines of 'he's a stupid man who does stupid things'. of course, there's no shortage of room for controversy here, but i feel it's important to credit the man where a very large credit is conspicuously missing.  i can explain with a single acronym: 'PEPFAR'.  if you know what that refers to, you really should be giving Mr. Bush his due.  for those unfamiliar with the acronym, it refers to the program, started by Mr. Bush, that provides massive AIDS relief, primarily to sub-saharan Africa.  yes, really - Bush initiated a program to help save the lives of, primarily, black Africans (a population in particularly critical need of such relief).  consider that the next time you're thinking of dumping on GWB - he helped black people...black people including a significant gay population...black people who couldn't even vote for him. seems to me like a program that would make a considerable contribution to civility and peace.  is that the sort of thing a stupid man does?  for a final kicker, President Obama has praised this Bush initiative and has extended the funding of the program.<br /><br />to conclude on a positive note, this is a brilliant piece of work, a comprehensive effort in a single (large) volume, an interesting read end-to-end and an encouragement to all who may feel a little overwhelmed by the common and depressing news of violence.  and a little bonus: esp. given the size of the tome, surprisingly few typographical issues - much appreciated!ed of such relief).  consider that the next time you're thinking of dumping on GWB - he helped black people...black people including a significant gay population...black people who couldn't even vote for him. seems to me like a program that would make a considerable contribution to civility and peace.  is that the sort of thing a stupid man does?  for a final kicker, President Obama has praised this Bush initiative and has extended the funding of the program.<br /><br />to conclude on a positive note, this is a brilliant piece of work, a comprehensive effort in a single (large) volume, an interesting read end-to-end and an encouragement to all who may feel a little overwhelmed by the common and depressing news of violence.  and a little bonus: esp. given the size of the tome, surprisingly few typographical issues - much appreciated!
B0028NSE3M|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of Isaac music because it covers almost everthing (that I know of) he recorded.  I am a new fan of this music but I feel that this is a great start and introduction to him and his talent.  He was a very talented and gifted musician.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The book is a good, pretty quick read. It is pretty well paced, and although you can see the obvious influences of Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings, Rice does a good job of establishing his own world and unique style. The characters develop as the series progresses, so do not expect to have a ton of change in the first book. Its very episodic. My one complaint was that the endings do feel awkward. Yes a cliffhanger is great, but these seem to end so abruptly. Overall, its a good read, well worth the day it might take you to finish, and its not meant to impress the hardcore fantasy audience, its meant more for the general reader who likes fantasy. Give it a try.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was not my favorite Blake Crouch book, but it was definitely worth the read.  I love his tribute to Twin Peaks, as I was an avid fan once upon a time.  I could almost hear the Twin Peaks music while I read.

B004R6JG7Q|5.0|I am not a car racing fan. But if anything can turn me into one, this is it. Le Mans turns back the clock and lets you experience the whole Le Mans atmosphere in its heyday. Nothing artificial is added. It's authentic. With impressive car racing and Steve McQueen in the lead, what more can you ask of a Racing Picture?
B0064Z7RXS|5.0|This is the album that made me become a SP fan for nearly 20 years now. Like most people, I first heard some of its singles before I bought it. I first got it on cassette back in 1995, mere months before Mellon Collie was released. I was instantly hooked. I played it so many times I had to buy it on CD because I wore out the tape.<br /><br />All these years later, I haven't grown tired of it, and I cannot play one track without wanting to listen to the album the whole way through. The frustrating part about describing SD to someone who never heard it is not being able to point out specific tracks to listen to first, because they're all wonderful. I guess I would recommend you to check out the singles first and then listen to the whole thing from beginning to end and see what you think.<br /><br />I think this album is the best proof available on a single release to make the case that Billy Corgan is one of the most underrated guitarists of all time. The guitar work is superb and the main selling point of SD. God knows it's not the vocals (J/K I like BC's voice :oP).<br /><br />The guitar tracks are layered throughout the album creating a sound that is very similar to My Bloody Valentine. So to those of you who were recommended this album based on a MBV purchase, that is why. SD has a much better sound though because SP had the luxury of having their album produced by Butch Vig whereas MBV's albums were self-produced. If you're looking for songs that sound similar to MBV, check out Rocket and Hummer.<br /><br />When you have phenomenal guitar work and brilliant production there's only one more ingredient you need to cook up the ultimate alternative album; songwriting.<br />SD was written and recorded during that special period of time where BC was at his absolute peak as a songwriter. Tracks like Today, Disarm and Cherub Rock made SP rockstars. These tracks are still played on alternative radio stations to this day.<br /><br />The tracks that truly grab you and turna casual fan into a lifelong \\"Pumpkinhead\\" are tracks like Soma, Geek U.S.A., and Mayonaise. Since they all run togther, its impossible for me to listen to Soma... and ONLY Soma. The tail-end of the album is mostly mellow (with one rather epic exception). Spaceboy is my favorite track from this batch. I think it's one of BC's most personal songs about his childhood. As catchy as it is, it will probably mean more to listeners who can relate to it. I hope this review is helpful.
1449410243|4.0|For the initial thickness of the book, I was expecting a few more cat comics.  You open it is and, as always, Mathew Inman's wit and wry sense of humor pervade everything, but a couple of the longer comics which have already have posted on the 'net go to full page and fill out several lengthy chunks of the book.  I love his sense of humor and having these comics together in a single collection makes it worth the purchase.

Works well in all environments so far and very pleased with it.  4 settings, and great to have because full power is often too much in confined spaces.

B009NY43NY|2.0|Boring, boring, boring!  Like the previous two Sookie books, I was again disappointed.  In this one, a great deal of time is spent telling us about what Sookies is eating, when she takes a shower, what she clothes she puts on.....  It's a snooze.  Barely any interaction with the supes, not much excitement, and NO sexy interaction with the vampires.  There is a somewhat satisfying conclusion for Sookie, (a 'well, that's not a surprise love interest') so at least there's that.  It lacks the charm and grisly fun that the first seven books brought.  I don't know what happened to the author, but after the ninth book, things went downhill.  A disappointing conclusion to a overall great series....
0425263924|5.0|Sylvia Day is a great author.  The series draws you in & you look forward to reading the next book.  It's a shame this is the last book of the three...

B003V1WTMM|5.0|This book was set.in Europe during WW ll . It is about 3 sisters that live in an old mansion, which is  their childhood home that they never leave. There are family  secrets and tales of their eccentric lives. I enjoyed reading this book.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and I will say that I went in loving it because A. Jeremy Renner played Hansel and B. Gemma Arterton is beautiful and I enjoyed her as Gretel the movie has over the top action humor extreme violence from heads being stepped on to heads being shot off if you're into that sort of thing. I was very satisfied with this movie and it is a buy for me!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I love Jurassic Park and this game is fun but the dollars are too few to earn and not everyone can pay actual money for them.  Perhaps if there were an exchange option like in other games to chang coins for dollars would make it better but the dollars are just too easily wasted and not replaced easily.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, every page was action packed. I can't wait to read the next one. Once you start, you don't want to put it down. Like always the book is better than the movie!
B000TEUSJK|1.0|I'm sure it was not needed in any way with I Claudius.<br />It was just  sex with very bad taste. If there is much truth to what part of  I saw.I think very little about their time.It relates very little to anything, except they had to much time and very little work to keep them busy.  I plan on disposing this DVD.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Completely disappointed with Ms. Day's ability to conclude the story and keep me interested.  I only finished the book because I am OCD and felt committed too.  The characters are lacking, tired of the same old sex-she cannot keep regurgitating the same scenes.  She's a sell out, and I would like my money back.
B00B5A9FLY|1.0|It is really, really  mindboggling to me that writers who have created such a fine series could possibly allow it to end in such a lame manner.  Arthur dying (without Gwen even being able to see him!)and Merlin walking down a modern street!!  Come on.  These writers can take a lesson from a real writer, JK Rowling, who superbly managed to carry her themes through 7 books and 8 movies and almost completely to tie up the loose ends in the final scenes.  At least the ending of her Harry Potter's saga was satisfying.  I wish that the Merlin writers would read the reviews posted here and realize how much they have disappointed loyal Merlin fans, including me,  who have relished watching this series for five years. It was a sloppy finale, for sure,  not only in content but in production.<br />What a disappointment.

Having high-end equipment since I could afford it and making my own soldered wire connections for years I can actually say that using these were the speediest no non-sense way to make those connections and have the confidence that they will stay connected until you remove them.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited a long time for the much anticipated release of this book. The release date was changed a couple of times but I still patiently waited, so eager to see the conclusion to Eva and Gideon's story. The day finally came and my pre-ordered book hit my kindle and I furiously began reading.<br /><br />The first 10% read was pretty much the same story as the first 2 books -- they have issues, jealousy trips, hot sex, couldn't get enough of each other, etc. I still pushed through reading, blurry vision and all, eager to know Gideon's secret and how the story ends.<br /><br />Not even halfway through, I began skipping pages. I pretty much did not care about Mark or Megumi or the Krav Maga classes or even Corinne and her husband, and kind of got annoyed of how much of the book was wasted with all of these filler crap.<br /><br />I got to the ending and had a WTF moment at the lack of ending! I totally felt ripped off. I kind of had a feeling that something was amiss as I was already at 99% and the story did not seem to have reached an end point. Lo and behold my suspicion was right, there was no ending, and another book (which I have no plans on reading) is coming. Thanks but no thanks. I just don't care what happens and doesn't happen to this couple anymore. I'm moving on.
B008MF3OEY|5.0|My kindle 5-way keyboard fits in it beautifully.  The cover feels luxurious.  It looks luxurious too.  I love being able to hold my kindle like a book and also being able to store it on a bookshelf alongside other books without it getting lost.  Nice to know my screen is protected.  I highly recommend this cover.
B00CFQMVLS|1.0|I've enjoyed the previous Die Hard movies, this one was awful.  Maybe the script writer was suffering from ADHD.  The dialog was lame, the actors annoying, the action made no sense.  It was agony just sitting through this crapfest.
B009R659L8|5.0|This is a great summer beach novel. Fast paced with some great twists of plot. Bravo to Ms. Clark for a well written entertaining read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Just finished both this, Winter of the World as well as Fall of Giants before it and can't wait for the third in the Trilogy to be released. Follett provides an education while at the same time entertaining you with powerful stories that stay with you.<br />Buy it, read it, give it as a gift...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent series.  Great period piece that make you fall in love with the characters and watch them grow over the years.  Great costumes, acting, and dialogue.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Highly recommended! Follett has never let me down. I've purchased many of his books as gifts to my friends and family. We all thoroughly enjoy his writing!
B0078ZDYW6|5.0|I think this was Sandra Bullock at her best.  This is science fiction lace with humor.  Add Stallone and Snipes, how can you go wrong?
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Just finished both this, Fall of Giants as well as Winter of the World and can't wait for the third in the Trilogy to be released.

1583334386|5.0|I read a lot of self-help science-based books. This is one of the best in terms of content. The other one is \\"59 seconds\\".<br /><br />This books is so good, I don't want to read it fast to get to the next one. It is thought-provoking, and each chapter takes me about a week to think through and notice applications around me. Highly recommended.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Omg this is my favorite. I have tried many bingo games and this by far is my favorite! I give it 5 stars !!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy this game. Can play for hours. Can become quite addictive if you let it. I think you'll like it.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This is a fast-paced page turner. Really hard to put down. Read it when you have no plans for the next few days. I loved the American historical backdrop and intrigue. Good going!!
B000002I97|5.0|Always relevant lyrics - grabbing my 1970's soul and keeping it alive.  Piercingly simple words and voice.  Thanks John Prine.
B0057URWSQ|5.0|Great writing and interesting characters. Love it! I can't wait to see the second season!Gabriel Macht is great and Patrick J. Adams are a great team
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This music gets my ideas moving, brain humming and shoulders rolling.  It's good stuff - now looking forward to second album.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is my favorite of the 3 in the series. It's amazing to see how Gideon and Eva have grown. Despite their pasts hitting them head on, the continue to grow and get stronger. I was so mad with the ending only because I can't wait to see how the story ends. Sylvia Day had become one of my favorite writers of all time. It's a must read series.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Predictable but  fun and easy read for a weekend. Couldn't stop reading until I new how it was going to end.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I loved every minute of this series. It's so much better than Band of Brothers! You will not be disappointed!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book, movie was better though.  Well worth the read, you will enjoy it.  Could be a little dissapointed as the movie was so good.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|A well written account of the founding of the Toranaga Shogunate and Japan's first contact with Western cultures. The understanding of the Japanese aesthetic and culture is outstanding. A tale well told.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The book started out slow. Didn't feel right. I couldn't get into it. Somewhere in the middle the book felt like the first two books. But then that whole I love Gideon feeling died. Very disappointed. To much fluff and filler. The sex scenes were trashy and soft porn. I hate how Carey was written in this book. He used to be so loveable. Eva is a disgrace to women everywhere. No back bone. She made me sick.  The ball was dropped with this book. Such a waste of $10.81 . Doubt I will buy the next book.
B0052RCX0G|5.0|A brilliant view of human history represented by man made objects. A unique approach to time and cultures through well chosen objects from the vast collection in the British Museum. The text is brief and to the point. I would have liked more detail, but nevertheless, it's fascinating. This is not a good book for Kindle because the illustrations are key.
0545123275|5.0|Captivating book.  Cant wait to read the rest of the books in the serious.  Could not put this book down.
075669812X|5.0|It gave my son to start reading in English language. What about reading and we'll explain what it means in Spanish.<br />We're using it almost like a school book. Now more interested in learning the English language.<br />The texts are very simple and very descriptive.<br />I hope that in a new edition and have included new kits
B006TKP2B2|3.0|Definitely a solid book, and I certainly got the message it was conveying. So, I was intrigued enough to finish (like I don't finish even terrible books!) but really was half-hearted about the whole thing. I never felt an emotional investment in any of the characters - though I think I was supposed to. Having so much character development in the book to not care about any of them was a big disappointment.<br /><br />All of this said, I'm in a little bit of a sci-fi slump right now. Just not finding books lately that scratch the itch, so keep this in mind if this review makes or breaks your decision to read this novel!
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|The game has a lot of historical guns I would reclaimed this game to others and more guns will come
0262731541|3.0|I would get  Bicycles &  Tricycles A Classic Treatise on Their Design and Construction by Archibald Sharp first, then read this one.<br />It can be rather heavy going and there doesn't seem to be a lot of examples (formulas) to compare what he's telling you. I bought this book to compare where the design of bicycles has advanced from the above mentioned book.  I'm going to read it again, just to make sure my first impression was correct.
0634022296|5.0|This book is amazing! It shows you how to play virtually every Beatle song correctly and with ease.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone who is a Beatle fan or plays the guitar.<br /><br />A must have at a great price!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Interesting concept and scenarios but somewhat lacked developed central characters to emotionally connect with.<br />The political assessments, military endeavors and human reactions to a non partisan, inhuman human enemy were creative and at heart idealistically American.
B00AVXSOQI|2.0|Felt like  Jane's first novel attempt. The story line quite simplistic.  The chacters lacked depth -- no mystery or surprises. All-in-all the story was very predictable.
0385349947|5.0|All women must read this book to move ourselves forward. Sandberg does a great job of intertwining personal experiences with concrete facts and examples. I appreciate her words of wisdom and try to keep them in the back of my mind during particularly stressful times.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use Yahoo for many years. I received my Kindle as a gift two years ago. I check my e-mails, send e-mails and file them in appropriate folders. I am very happy.
B003102JDM|5.0|Wonderful dry humor, a movie you'll want to watch over and over  to appreciate even more. If you remember the 60's you'll love this movie even more. The Cohn brothers are genius.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|A tremendously detailed view of someone sitting in the therapist's chair struggling with his flawed humanity.. and helping others with theirs .. a great translation of the original Israeli series..<br />So far I am only part way through Series 1 and I am riveted, but have to take breaks to recover!!<br />Fabulous performances all round and Gabriel Byrne is truly marvellous.
B00005JN0T|5.0|I just love this movie. It has always been one of my favorites.  Finally got it when I needed another $5 on an order for free shipping.  I just love the story line and the main robot character.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Couldn't wait for Season Seven to come out and it did not disappoint. Only disappointment was it ending so soon. Now I am anxiously awaiting Season Eight!
B008220BLG|5.0|Cute, romantic little love cures all zombie story.  My teenage and slightly younger daughter just love this romance of zombie meets girl and cures all zombies.  And yes there are some scary boney zombies and nasty zombies that eat people but it is sexless and foul language less and that is good enough for me!
B0053O89Z6|4.0|RECAP: The series follows Ted, an architect telling his children the story if how he met their mother. Each season shows Ted and his friends experiencing all of the moments and antics that will eventually/hopefully lead to Ted meeting and falling in love with his future wife. In general, it's probably necessary to have watched the previous seasons before jumping in at Season 6, since there are references to the past and previous character development plays a role. This is a well-written and family appropriate show that keeps fans begging for more.<br /><br />Season 7 kicked off in the fall of 2011 with main characters:  Josh Radnor as Ted Mosby, Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson, Cobie Smulders as Robin Scherbatsky, Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin, and Jason Segel as Marshall Eriksen. As the series progresses it is also picking up more and more celebrity cameos [ehem, did you know that the voice of &#34;future Ted&#34; in the precaps is actually Bob Saget?]; Season 7 features guest appearances from Marshall Manesh as Ranjit, Chris Romano as Punchy, Nazanin Boniadi as Nora, Wayne Brady as James Stinson, Frances Conroy as Loretta Stinson, Alexis Denisof as Sandy Rivers, Kal Penn as Kevin, Becki Newton as Quinn Garvey, Chris Elliott as Mickey Aldrin, Vicki Lewis as Dr. Sonya, Martin Short as Garrison Cootes, Bill Fagerbakke as Marvin Eriksen, Cristine Rose as Virginia Mosby, Ray Wise as Robin Scherbatsky, Sr., Suzie Plakson as Judy Eriksen, Ellen D. Williams as Patrice, Ashley Williams as Victoria, Brendan Robinson as Ned, Conan O’Brien as extra, Katie Holmes as Naomi, “Weird Al” Yankovic as himself, and Ernie Hudson as himself.<br /><br />SEASON 7:  Season 6 came to a close with the news that Marshall and Lily are expecting a baby.  Ted has broken things off with Zoey, but the return of Victoria this season could mark a change in the way Ted pursues finding the mother of his future children.  Robin and Barney seemed to mature (a little) in the previous season, possibly making Season 7 the prime time for them to find lasting love.<br /><br />Episode 1:  “The Best Man”—Marshall and Lily try to conceal the news of their pregnancy as the gang attends Punchy’s wedding in Cleveland.  Just when Robin admits her lingering feelings for Barney, he makes another attempt with Nora; we get a glimpse of Barney’s future wedding as well as the idea that he may have had to pick between two eligible brides.<br /><br />Episode 2:  “The Naked Truth”—Barney stays up all night trying to prove to Nora that he’s worth another shot; Ted is torn between two women; Beercules emerges online, threatening Marshall’s potential to be hired with an environmental law firm.<br /><br />Episode 3:  “The Ducky Tie”—Barney moves into the reaping phase of a long-term con against Marshall and Lily; after reuniting with Victoria, Ted begins to reevaluate why he hasn’t been able to make headway in relationships.<br /><br />Episode 4:  “The Stinson Missile Crisis”—Barney decides to focus on his ‘A-story’ with Nora, but has to abort all side-missions.  Robin reveals how she ended up in mandatory therapy for an assault charge.<br /><br />Episode 5:  “Field Trip”—A field trip for Ted’s architecture class takes a detour.  Marshall begins to think he put his new boss on a pedestal, but refuses complacency; Robin enters a relationship with Kevin.<br /><br />Episode 6:  “Mystery vs. History”—In the age of social media, Ted goes on a new sort of ‘blind’ date.  Barney and Robin can’t help but expose the gender of Marshall and Lily’s baby; Kevin comes to terms with the mental state of his new group of friends.<br /><br />Episode 7:  “Noretta”—James, Barney’s brother, pays a visit and shatters the glass on similarities between Nora and Loretta; Kevin evaluates the relationship between Ted and Robin.<br /><br />Episode 8:  “The Slutty Pumpkin Returns”—Ted gets another shot (and closure) at the romancethat never was.  Lily’s grandparents leave their house in Long Island to the young couple.<br /><br />Episode 9:  “Disaster Averted”—Barney, nervous about meeting Nora’s parents, barters three slaps to Marshall in exchange for retiring the Ducky Tie.  Ted tells Kevin the story of how the gang survived Hurricane Irene, and, despite their respective relationships, stirs up old feelings between Barney and Robin.<br /><br />Episode 10:  “Tick Tick Tick”—Ted and Marshall take a trip at a concert.  Barney and Robin realize they need to try again, but only one of them follows through.<br /><br />Episode 11:  “The Rebound Girl”—Lily and Marshall decide to move to Long Island, causing Robin to feel alone and confused; Ted and Barney make a rash decision to adopt a baby together.<br /><br />Episode 12:  “Symphony of Illumination”—Marshall falls victim to suburban antics.  Robin contemplates her ‘almost pregnant’ situation only to be depressed about knowing she’ll never have that crisis again.<br /><br />Episode 13:  “Tailgate”—Marshall narrates the episode at his dad’s grave, but the audience is greater than expected.  Robin gets another shot at live TV; Ted and Barney embark on a business venture which turns Ted’s apartment into a bar.<br /><br />Episode 14:  “46 Minutes”—With Lily and Marshall 46 minutes away, the rest of the gang runs wild… but makes it home just after curfew.<br /><br />Episode 15:  “The Burning Beekeeper”—Lily’s dad has overstayed his welcome, but manages to ruin one last important function.<br /><br />Episode 16:  “The Drunk Train”—Barney and Ted discover that “the drunk train” is a prime spot for picking up desperate women, though Barney ultimately sets his sights a little higher.  Robin accepts Kevin’s proposal, but later recants due to her infertility.<br /><br />Episode 17:  “No Pressure”—Now that Ted has bursted the friendship bubble with Robin, Victoria’s warning becomes more clear.  Barney uncovers a secret box of bets at Lily and Marshall’s house.<br /><br />Episode 18:  “Karma”—When Robin moves out, Ted is overwhelmed with separation anxiety.  Quinn, aka Karma, manages to turn Barney’s tricks around, showing him how it feels to be swindled.<br /><br />Episode 19:  “The Broath”—Barney and Quinn craft an elaborate ploy to offset the gang’s meddling; Robin and Ted struggle to repair their friendship.<br /><br />Episode 20:  “Trilogy Time”—The tri-annual Star Wars marathon leads Marshall, Barney, and Ted to review the progress (or lack of progress) each has made in the past three years; the revelations lead to revolutions, including Barney’s desire to settle down with Quinn.<br /><br />Episode 21:  “Now We’re Even”—Barney wears Ted out with ‘legendary’ outings, but we learn that Barney needs the distraction to keep him from thinking about Quinn; Robin becomes an on-air hero; Lily confesses her dream about Ranjit to Marshall.<br /><br />Episode 22:  “Good Crazy”—Marshall’s stress about the baby causes Lily to trick him into an Atlantic City trip with Barney, who also needs a break from worrying about Quinn.

B0091REZMW|3.0|this game is kind of addictive but to progress in a reasonable amt of time requires lots of in game purchases. or maybe I am just not patient enough.
B000FA675C|5.0|For those who question Christianity this could be a historical approach to what really happened and why catholics act the way they do today.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|If anyone is truly an Eagles' fan, this is almost a required purchase.  All of your questions<br />about all of the current and former Eagles' members will be answered.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|An excellent DVD.  Sound and video are both perfect. Don't miss this opportunity to go to an Eagles' concert w/o actually being there.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is hilarious!! Plus sexy and  romantic! To say I loved it is putting it mildly. It was  amazing.  I highly recommend this book!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I have never been able to play it because it does not open it.  Since you had no option on that problem I voted for the least.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Loved learning about and feeling the characters in this book. Mr Hosseni really makes them come alive. Had a difficult time following and keeping track of them though. The book jumped around a great deal.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show from the start and believe it or not got better and better. They built the characters and the plot I think at the correct speed. Plus one more believe it or not it gets better every season, it is like a 500 page book you do not want to end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the game wish there were more levels. I would play it all day. Very mind challenging. I would recommend it to everyone
B000003EPN|4.0|oh, ok i thought it was aida, i can make many comparisons btw this recording & solti's around the same time aida with price,vickers, merrill.  merrill sounds like a cool  rat pack guy from the 60's. moffo makes good coloratura but i missed sutherland & her endings on a high note. moffo doesnt even have one in the whole recording. kraus, is great, really one of the best tenor voices i've ever heard after pavarotti & he trhows a few high c's here & there; i think a total of 3 in the whole recording. solti's direction very strong, but really comparable with his contemporary aida. the cd engenier, placed the track cuts in the middle of passages, so is no good for transfering to mp3 player or i-pod. i repeat, not compatible with new technology, example: la donna e mobile track ends when last word pensier is being pronounced & the high c ending is cutted in btw 2 tracks. countess ceprano melody starts in the track before the one the scene is sung., etc.. etc.. etc.. & you can hear all the fraction of second pauses really out of place, it looks like the engenier had only 4 hours to do all the cuts. overall the singing is good, but not superb. im waiting by the end of this week for sills/kraus rigoletto. hope he didnt change his voice too much in the aprox 10 yrs difference btw the 2 recordings.i know sills is gonna be great as always . then i will be trying kubelik's rigoletto scotto/bergonzi/dieskau. i m just trying to look for something to compete with the magnificent sutherland/pavarotti/ bonynge set.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|If you like a good puzzle game with shiny graphics and catchy music, this should be right up your alley. I'm on the third level set and the puzzles are getting progressively harder as it should. I really like it a lot and it's certainly worth 0.99 (though I got it as FAOTD).
B00BB22GQM|5.0|They walked the fine line between trying new stuff but keeping that signature style that made them popular.  Not nearly as many upbeat songs like previous albums but its a great album to run straight through.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The report said it was a&#34;feel good&#34; love story. Oh Yeah? Well it was much more than that. And, what a fabulous advertisement for the writing group wherein the author learnt his trade. I wish I could belong to it. Instead my first attempt at writing is sitting in the Amazon archives amongst thousands of others. No, seriously, I might be biased as the subject is all about psychology and the people who make it a deeply interesting story have learnt the fact that a good author is someone who understands how people work. It seems to me that Aspergers Autism Syndrome can be enjoyable and hilarious in some instances contrary to my own daily experience. This story has lifted my mood and understanding of Aspergers but most of all has allowed me to think positively for the first time about knowing and sharing a life with an Asperger. Congratulations, a well described and entertaining introduction to the habits and skills of an Asperger as well as a &#34;feel good&#34; love story. Congratulations!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I like the book so far but I haven't read much of it yet.  I will have more time to read soon/
B007SGM084|5.0|This is one of the most well written series I've ever read. It grasped a hold of my emotions and took me into the book. I laughed, cried, and thoroughly enjoyed this series
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Cute fun entertaining. Keeps you busy if you are board and it seems to be like the movie was. Thanks for the cuteness
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|This doesn't deserve star. It doesn't work. I tested it out today and got rid of it today. Don't waste your time on this app. I think it's a prank app. It just gives fake and made up passwords. I tried to hack in a few and it didn't work. You can try this app if you want to but it doesn't work.
B00005U2JL|5.0|got this for my hubby for christmas and he was so happy to get it. when i bought it i forgot all about it until it came in the mail and it was a surprise to the both of us. my hubby watches it everyday and sings. i think hes a dork but i got to love him

B009X01GJ2|5.0|It is great!  Stands up to all that I have tried to do with it. I am happy with the product and price.

B003K1EYM6|1.0|This is a very hard device to review. On the one hand I think the connector works perfectly. However, it's only purpose is to connect to the iPad, so I believe you have to rate how the device works together with the iPad.<br /><br />First I'll note that this produce gets very different reviews. Some people say it works great. Some that it doesn't work at all. The reason for this is that all Apple products are designed to work one way and one way only. If you deviate in any way from what Apple expects you to do their products won't work. And to make matters worse, there isn't any way to manually make a correction. You're just stuck.<br /><br />So for example, if you have some photos that you'd like to transfer to the iPad and you don't want to use sync, you can't just copy these onto the SD card and use the connector. That would be too simple. You have to make a directory called DCIM and copy only files that use eight characters in the name. Heaven forbid if you renamed them! If you deviate in any way the process won't work. And to make matters worse Apple won't ever tell you this straight up, you have to discover it for yourself. Why you don't get a Finder type interface where you can select what you want to import is beyond me. It would be simple enough to implement.<br /><br />For many people this connector will be a five star device. Some will find it to not work at all. Both will be right. Most of the time for me it's a five star device. But sometimes because of the lame Apple software it's a zero star device. Weighing the good and bad experiences, and noting that the frustration can be significant, I give this connector one star. But in truth it's really the iPad which is deserving of such a low score.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I'm very young about 13 using my mom's kindle to read this book and the Percy Jackson series I really like the way u put Greek mythology in like it can be real but we might not know so it keeps me really interested and hooked especially when you add the Greek weapons that are actually real and not made up I really like they the book
0545586178|4.0|While there's often a slow-down in the second volume of a triliogy- that was not the case here. \\"Catching Fire\\" was just as engrossing as \\"Hunger Games\\".<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple of reasons. First off, it's dystopian. REALLY dystopian, to the point that I am not at all sure anything that repressive would actually work for 75 years. There are peasant rebellions- I don't think that's much of a spoiler (and I'm a sucker for peasant rebellions), but I think they wouldhave happened prior to now... However, the idea that a sword cuts both ways is excellently well done here; the very things that the establishment is using to try to keep the people down are what are riling them up.<br /><br />The second reason: Katniss still does not feel real to me; she's more like a window into the world. Which is fine, and well in the tradition of utopias/dystopias, but it does make her less engaging. The secondary characters, though, are brilliantly depicted and very vivid, so it seems clear to me that Katniss's presentation is an choice by the author. It's just- when I was 17, I was positive about a lot of things. I may have been dead wrong, but I was POSITIVE! Katniss is mired in ambiguity, and that makes her a better p0rotag for the novles, but it makes her hard to engage with.<br /><br />Still excellent book! And I am looking forward to the third, grim though these 2 have been.

B00947N6UG|5.0|The Boogeyman, Pitch Black, is trying to take over the world, leaving the children with bad dreams, fear, and negativity. Santa, the Easter Bunny, the tooth fairy, the Sandman, and Jack Frost gang up to try to conquer him.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie. It is rewarding to watch this movie just to see the incredibly beautiful animation. We first saw pieces of this Blu-ray movie playing at the store. It was so amazing, that it was this movie that finally convinced us to buy a very large, high definition TV.<br /><br />Special effects aside, the plot of this movie is brilliant and uplifting. Each character has his or her own personality and is highly and creatively developed. I highly recommend this movie masterpiece for the young and old alike. This is a very special, unforgettable movie!

B009VLX8FS|3.0|&#34;Red&#34; may be what some listeners were looking for. I bought it for my kids but snagged a listen or two for myself. It was not what I hoped to hear. I've been a fan of Taylor Swift for several years and have hoped to hear her voice mature into the Country sound that will make her a legend. This CD doesn't get there - mostly because this is a Pop album with a touch of County and I expected it to be the other way around. I enjoy many styles of music from Rock to Blues to Country and some Pop. &#34;Red&#34; doesn't do it for me. I'll give it 3 stars because it is good enough to listen to occasionally, but not enough to make into my normal playlist.

B000FCKGPC|2.0|I can't believe I waisted this much time reading this book. The only reason I read it and will read the last is because I am hoping for a little justice for a few characters that I actually care what happens to them. As for now, I think Martin long winded and cruel!
1609611543|3.0|It's hard to rate this book because I would like to give it a 3.5 rating. It certainly is deeply thought provoking and I was totally enthusiastic at first. However, a few questions arise. The author sorts of contradicts himself more than once. Namely when he first states that wheat was way less harmful before it was severely modified in the 70's and 80's, then he makes a case of how several studies already proved it harmful during WWII. How is that if it hadn't been modified to the point of harm yet ?<br />Secondly, he certainly hammers his message with a mollah's rigid fanatism, which is unsettling in itself.<br />On the whole however, the book (which gets really boring and over scientifical around mid-way) makes a clear and strong point of how wheat have become truly poisonous for a good part of today's population. I personally belong to that group of otherwise thin, very active and healthy people who just can't get rid of a small fat cushion on their belly (I call it my kangaroo pouch). I went as far as having it surgically removed and guess what, 80% of it grew right back... I do respond very well weight wise to the low card approach, so I've decided to go wheat free for 4 weeks (if I can do it, that is) and see what happens with the \\"belly\\".<br />I don't believe everybody is wheat intolerant (my husband for one can seem to swallow large quantities of absolutely everything including heavily wheat based products and remain devilishly lean), but I do think that the over consumption of wheat and obesity/diabetes IS totally related. And yes, the food pyramid stands on its head, that I've been convinced of a long time ago !<br />So off to try a wheat free life for 4 weeks, will be back to update after the test period). So far, so good, no withdrawal symptoms and wayyyyy less apetite than when I start the day with wheat based products...

0988262592|5.0|This book is applicable to all professional areas.  The authors use Information Technology as their base to develop the story however if you provide customer service, you can extrapolate the concepts to your environment. Not giving too much away, the reference to Flatland and The Goal might be compelling enough to add two more books to your reading list.

B000V5ZIBU|4.0|For my money, this is clearly the best Star Trek TV series.<br /><br />While at least one other reviewer has compared the \\"...backward but spiritual...\\" Bajorians to the Palestinians and the aggressive and imperialistic Cardassian's to the Israeli's, however, the storyline is written so vaguely that it could easily be any story of occupation, ethnic hatred, and great power interference.  One could easily see this as a parable of either post cold war Eastern Europe or even Korea or even end of the 19th Century Philippines (though, the last one is a bit of a stretch since Germany and the United Kingdom quickly lost interest in both the Philippines and the Hawaii islands once they realized that the U.S. was not going anywhere soon.)<br /><br />This series was also made without the creative direction (interference?) of Gene Rodenbury. Supposedly, one of Rodenbury's issues was that technology would, by providing for material needs at virtually no cost and freeing people from fear of want, the humans of Star Trek would be free of the selfish and self-serving character defects that define humanity in general.  DS9 rejects this humanistic utopia for a world that - while striving to achieve those goals - reflects that human beings are flawed and one can never go too far wrong by expecting that human frailty will win out in the end.<br /><br />DS9 is pretty cleverly crafted to have a bevy of stories. The wormhole next to DS9 provides a constant source of mischief and interesting characters. Dr Bashir's hospital means that there are also medical drama stories. Quark's bar provides another venue as well. There is the drama of Star Fleet as \\"peace keepers\\", the Bajorians as a new government making the transition from guerilla force to legitimate government, and the Cardassians as the previous occupying power struggling to adjust to their new and reduced role in the universe. As if that wasn't enough there is the holo-deck, an alternate universe, time travel, and the whole prophet/worm hole alien storyline to create storylines. Finally, DS9 gets first one warship and then several from many different governments, so there are space combat stories and stories about discovering what's just over the horizon.<br /><br />Some of the stories are retellings of classic stories from American culture and/or literature. For example one of the episodes is a slightly different retelling of [[ASIN:B00005JCB7 Charly]]. By no means do I have a good grounding in American lit or pop culture, so I'm sure for every story that I saw as a retelling of a classic tale, there must have been two that I missed.<br /><br />However, that doesn't imply that I liked every single episode or every part of every episode. But, there were so many different types of episodes and different storylines within each episode that there was usually something that was enjoyable.<br /><br />As the multi-season story arc dealing with the conflict between the Dominion and the Alliance (Federation, Romulians, Klingons, (sometimes) Bajorians, and (sometimes) Cardassians), grows more intense and walks toward war, one of the themes that is teased out in great detail is the tendency of governments under threat to become security states. Is it possible to protect the values that you believe in by betraying them? What is the line between seeking to maintain order and seeking justice? Many of these questions are initially addressed in the cat and mouse game between Odo and Quark in terms of law enforcement, but become even more problematic as the series develops themes addressing terrorism and war. In many ways, this series is very prophetic in terms of post 9-11 U.S.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Deservedly popular, this book is a genuine page turner. Glynn is at the top of her game with engaging characters, original prose and a great plot. Read it... It won't disappoint.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I think the first two seasons of Downton Abbey are just about perfect, and what better way to watch them than back to back? A wonderful set to own and enjoy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I've read everything I can get my hands on about the Bin Laden raid.  It was awesome to get the view point from the 3rd man up the stairs on that historical night.  Makes me feel like I have some proof of what really happened.  I would my rather hear it from our heros in uniform than from our president.  If you want an inside and a picture painted of how it went down...read the book!! Not to mention its written by a true American patriot, the kind I will always support and certainly don't mind spending my money on.  WELL DONE SIR!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE!!!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|One of the best television dramas ever created. This set is wonderful, and is great for sitting and watching all the episodes back to back.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|A trilogy is 3 SD, plus you kept pushing the release date - very disappointed in you.  But, I read it 'cause I had to know how it ended but surprise!, not yet.  I feel agree with the rest of the reviews, plots thrown in that aren't needed, you could have focused on the Russian but even that was lame.  I don't think I'm buying the 4th, I prefer to make up my own happily ever after for Gideon and Eva! and it won't take me two more books to do it.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Daniel Craig makes for probably the most likable Bond ever, even more than his progenitor Sean Connery.  It's a bit long-in-the-tooth for the storyline and it lacks some of the sexy punch of previous Bond's (the leading sex-tress has a strange look, I think. Not exactly the usual drop-dead-gorgeous Bond-Girl type.)<br /><br />After watching this you just can't help but ask the question:  How will the Bond series evolve from this?  I can't wait to find out.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love Gideon and Eva, but I felt every time we turned around they were having sex. Don't get me wrong the scenes were great, but I missed the story line. I would have loved to had more information on Nathan, more of a triangle with Brett.  What is this with Cary, Trey and Tiatiana?  I don't know I wasn't not feeling the completed book. I am excited there is a 4th installment maybe some of my questions will be answered.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I have purchased this unit for myself and my wife we are avid MMORPG enthusiasts. The G13 gives you added control and function to the game giving you the added edge needed at times.

0316228532|1.0|It hurts me to write this review, but it has to be done. One star may seem a little harsh, but truth be told, I am just mostly frustrated. It took me about a month to get through this book, when I usually breeze through them, and the only reason I couldn't is because J.K. Rowling gave me nothing to look forward to.<br /><br />I will start out by pointing out the positives in this book: it is VERY WELL written. No one can deny that Rowling can write, and no one can fault her skill. She is an incredible writer. But I am not here to mark her on her writing, and unfortunately, everything else about the book for me (beyond the writing) just fell short.<br /><br />A lot of the 4 and 5 star reviews said that Rowling has a right to change the genre of her books and this is what adult books are like and to stop comparing it with Harry Potter, but worst of all, that the characterization was so good that they were drawn in and could not put the book down.<br /><br />The book started out interestingly enough, with what might have been the only interesting character in the whole book! In fact, Barry Fairbrother was the only one with any redeeming qualities, or so it seemed. Yet, his appearance was short-lived - literally - and we are left with this enormous mess that he left behind and with the collection of horrendous characters that live in this town. It's really hard to read a book when you can't like or root for any character, especially surprising with the amount of characters in this book. None of them were the least bit likable, and no, I'm not looking for a perfect Hollywoodified set of characters. If I wanted to read a book about perfect people, who live perfect lives where it all wraps up very nicely and everything ends happily, I'd have opted for a chicklit. But you can't even begin to feel sorry for them, you just hate them.<br /><br />One reviewer put it best by saying, \\"It's as if Rowling said, 'I want to write an adult novel with adult themes, so how's about I throw in some pedophilia? AND some mental illness? AND a rapist? AND a sadistic, revolting teenager or two? AND some adultery? AND a crack whore? AND a self-mutilator? AND an abusive husband/father? AND wives who are hatefully contemptuous of their husbands? AND some husbands who act more like children than men? AND about a thousand f-bombs? AND some ugly sex? AND...AND...AND...'\\"<br /><br />Some reviewers implied that we should be commending Rowling for this book the way we would Orwell for 1984. Um, seriously? I'm all for great literary novels that discuss serious themes and absolutely shred our society to pieces such as A Clockwork Orange and  Lord of the Flies, but this book was not framed in that sense, and it definitely did not read that way either. This book takes about eighteen or so characters, places them in a boring little town, kills an important member of their council and then we watch them as they all fight with each other on who gets this vacant seat, while little inner family dramas occur on the sidelines. I really would not place this book up there with the likes of 1984. There was nothing clever about it, nothing creative, and nothing ingenious. It is a boring story, a tale as old as time, told again and again and again. Yes, Rowling is an incredible writer, but this story with its plot and characters and so on, was just not good enough to be categorized with the brilliant books mentioned above.<br /><br />I appreciate stories that are realistic and reflect societies in their true form, but this really had no redeeming qualities, not a shred of hope, and the last few pages (Part 7 that is), might have been her idea of reforming the characters and erasing the 400+ pages that just happened, but they really don't. If it was an interesting story, I would have forgiven all of that, but it was just dull. It was just one of those things where I lost interest because it was taking too long for me to get through this book.<br /><br />I'll leave you with whatone reviewer so eloquently said: \\"Oh, for one multi-faceted Severus Snape, with his venomous tongue and his doe Patronus! Oh, for a many-layered Dumbledore with his upright heart and his murky past! Why do the kids get all the fabulously-drawn characters with their wrongs and their rights, their petty hatreds and their monumental graces, and we adults get landed with a novel full of nothing but Dursleys?\\"<br /><br />P.S. I have to point out, J.K. Rowling seems to have a thing with 7 parts.one reviewer so eloquently said: \\"Oh, for one multi-faceted Severus Snape, with his venomous tongue and his doe Patronus!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Yes, I know this trilogy is supposed to be all the rage.<br /><br />Poorly-written erotica complete with a superhero/pilot/billionaire/Adonis/philanthropist perfect prince fantasy male lead who is inexplicably drawn to the female protagonist who's only distinguishing feature is that she's so undistinguished that any female reader can drop themselves into the role might make for a popular book, but it doesn't mean it's any good.<br /><br />There's better erotica out there; better stories with fleshed out, realistic characters; stories that adhere to quaint notions like sentence structure, grammar, and punctuation.  I'm happy that Amazon has a money back guarantee.

B00B04NJI0|4.0|I can't believe what i just watched, i mean nothing has ever been like this movie. This is too bizarre and absurd, but don't expect it's just another horror movie with jumps and stuff, it's more than that. With 26 short movies blending together, it's \\"wildly uneven\\" (rottentomatoes.com).<br /><br />I found THE ABCs OF DEATH really appealing and quite interesting, but it's hard to digest. Each letter (while some are not) contains graphic violence, sex and nudity.<br /><br />Many of them are plotless, which seems to me is experimental.<br /><br />If you love to watch movies that goes over-the-top and exhaust your senses, then i recommend you to buy it.

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is easily one of my most favorite Android games. Simple but deep gameplay.<br /><br />The only warning I should give is that this game is VERY addictive. At one point, even I thought I was playing it too much. However, once I actually beat the game, I was able to control myself a little better. :)<br />I still tend to replay this game regularly, though.<br /><br />I got this app as the Free App of the Day but it would be well worth $1.99 if I had to pay for it.

B009GEDP26|5.0|I can't wait to see what happens in Sept. will she or won't she, or will there be another great twist..<br />I do have a couple of question - will Castle's dad make more appearances?  And will Rick tell Becket about him?
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Paid $4.99 to watch this, and it's so pixelated, I can barely make out what's going on in darker scenes. I finally just gave up. It's not my equipment, I have extremely fast internet and computer. I tried refreshing a bunch of times, but it's apparently rendered in crappy resolution. I guess they want you to watch it in HD on some other device, but if so, then it shouldn't cost the same amount to rent it to watch on your computer.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Awesome book.  Anyone in education should read this.  I have recommended this book to many of my co-workers and to my<br />son who will graduate college with a degree in education.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I had difficulty putting this one down.  I could not figure out what he was doing.  Really enjoyed it very much.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this book having never read the author and not being a big SciFi fan. But the reviews convinced me to give it a try and very happy I am that I did. The story is futuristic but not bogged down with a lot of scientific explanations. It is fast paced and very well written. Anyone who reads a lot will tell you that the telling of the story is more important than the story itself.  I have already purchased \\"Shift\\" and pre purchased \\"Dust\\" so I do highly recommend this book.
B009E3EY38|5.0|It was just what I wanted and more. The CD was perfect as well as the blueray and dvd. My fiancè was very pleased
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The main point of this book was to show a highly educated man in the field of neurology and his experiences with ND. It was a good read especially towards the end when he finally realizes that his sister was the beautiful angel on the butterfly.  The short section on the medical reasons that what he experienced could not have been reliant upon any physical brain function was too detailed with medical information for most average people to relate to.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss Everdeen was never drawn to take place in the Hunger Games. Until the only alive person she sure she loves is drawn, her little sister. So Katniss offers to take Prim's  place . And though it cant get any worse for her none any than Peeta the baker's son gets chosen!

0761158464|5.0|I'm a big Star Wars fan, the scenes inside are great and very representative, this book is amazing, a great piece for my collection
B00007KQA3|1.0|Having read the book, the movie was very boring. Even if I hadn't read the book, it would have been boring.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|What a beautiful love story. The story all around is great, interesting, entertaining, sweet. It's about young love, destiny, magic and hope. Perfect for the whole family.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this bag a long time ago its supper flimsy not durable at all. I paid 50-60 for this bag so I wouldn't buy again but because its currently 29$ with free shipping I would.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|john paul II was so great. this movie is so much like the real JP II. wonderfully done. God Bless.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game on the kindle fire should be updated somehow faster because there's a update on the iPod and it just got out like a few days ago and I want to no when I'm supposed to get it because there is spawn eggs the title screen is different and buckets! But over all its the best game on the kindle  fire
0393068382|4.0|If you are a Cis person, or have ever been called a Cis person, then pick this book up and educate yourself as to why some people feel themselves incapable of fitting into the gender binary.  Just be warned, it's a VERY cerebral and dry, difficult read.  Not for the faint of cerebellum.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I liked this even more than most Grisham works and I've read them all.  It's more &#34;fictional&#34; and less technical than his normal stuff and it reveals what an amazing story teller he really is.  Great characters and great plot twists every step of the way.  I would recommend it to all Grisham fans, and even more so to those who may have been lukewarm to him in the past.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Tarantino is a little boy pouring out his darkest comic book fantasies cram packed with songs from his childhood.  There are a thousand ways to mutilate the human body, and he attempts to find them all.  Grotesque brutality followed by ice cold indifference is his mode.  By now we can see it coming a mile away.  It's nonstop overstylized action, dialogue, and camerawork makes even blowing up a theater full of nazi officials over David Bowie's \\"Cat People\\" seem subtle.
B008035H16|4.0|Mainly lists the start up of Zappos and what led to its development.  Gave some good ideas about creating a workforce that has fun while doing the work on one's own terms.  It is a template for future companies and how to make a difference in the work environment.
B00BGDQNLU|4.0|Even if predictable story of the board of executives of a giant corporation in the 1950's appointing a dunce from the mail room as CEO so that they may sell all their shares and buy even more at a steep discount when he ruins the company.  Of course the dunce happens to have a master's degree in business and invents the hula hoop and frisbee.  The tone and style of the terrific cinematography makes this worth watching.  The Coen brothers spared no expense on their sets.
B003DNN0L2|2.0|The only thing this movie has in common with the book is the characters.  It was a big letdown.  However, if you haven't read the book, it is somewhat entertaining.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|I have no doubt these big movie stars watched the play and wanted to recapture the magic they felt.  They failed.  Why not use professional singers?  The songs themselves are often in too high a key with too much fake emotion and with a musical backing that exposes rather than hides their vocal limitations.  I also disliked the shaky handheld camera, constant close ups, and flashy CGI.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app will have you hooked and keep you active duringa few free minutes.  I've even used it when I know who I'm taking about but can't think of their name.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|QT knocks another one out of the park.  Don't listen to the critics...there was just enough &#34;N-Word&#34; and violence.  Foxx was OK, but Christoph Waltz was friggin AMAZING!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|we were able to use the frogs crickets and stream on many occassions to put our baby girl back to sleep in the middle of the night.  life saver!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Just like the other shark eating games this one is pretty fun for the kids.  9 yrs and over may be bored early.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very nice game, I became mad for that! I just can\\"t unterstand how to update the app.  Can you say me how to do it?
B004EPYZQC|4.0|my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. You will to. I like to use it when paying bills. Numbers are large and easy to read.
B001HN6922|4.0|my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.
B00BGZ8TVA|3.0|I think the movie is just okay especially the story is not impressed at all.<br /><br />I am kind of disapppointed and expect the movie should be better.
B004529NKC|3.0|my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Ads are fine on free apps, but not on paid apps. Even worse when they try to disguise the ads as &quot;rewards&quot; for playing. Epic fail.
B0041KKYBA|3.0|my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I should have know better.  The second in the series of  Follett historical mega-trilogy drops off in interest.  Sections seem long and tedious--e.g. pre-war London riots.  The characterization also is less convincing.  The interconnections among the characters feel forced (because they are, of course).  Nonetheless,  they are impressive pieces of writing.  AND I really like the synchronized audio and text.  John Lee is  a great reader.  I buy audio books just because Frank Muller is the reader;  I will do the same for John Lee.
B004LWZW42|4.0|my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.
B00571F26Y|4.0|In Wheat Belly, William Davis lays out a compelling argument that modern strains of hybridized wheat are behind the obesity epidemic and a host of other health problems. Anyone who has compulsively devoured a basket of bread in a restaurant, or finished off a box of cookies after a full meal, will recognize much truth in these pages. Dr. Davis strikes a nice balance between hard science and readable prose. Thankfully, Wheat Belly never rises to the level of a polemic or a food manifesto. It feels more like a gentle, well-reasoned invitation to un-complicate your life, by removing its most problematic and untested foodstuff.
B002I7FFYO|4.0|my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath great human story of a family disposses by the dust bowl who make it to California to search for work.  This is the classic performance by Henry Fonda.  It is a great movie and an outstanding performance.  Truely, they don't make them like this any more
B002ZG976U|3.0|my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.
B00AK57N00|5.0|In just a mins of playing I got addicted. I have green playing for over an hour. The game is very simple but loads of fun. Enjoy.
0060786523|5.0|I am personally interested in modern India.  This book is long, but it draws the reader in.  It has an historical slant (India just after  partition) and describes in great detail many aspects of Indian life and culture.  After reading it, I felt like I had just spent a year in India, in the company of a close Indian friend who invited me to their home and explained everything that went on, and beyond that let me experience life with different castes, religions, and rural vs city life.
B000068FWC|5.0|1979 was replete with several horrible music elements: first we had the charred remains of the very tired and worn-out Disco Era (Donna summer, Village People); the usual snooze-a-thon of romantic dirge (Peaches and Herb, Neil Diamond) and last but not least the slow but sure influx of wimpy country ballads (Kenny Rogers, ad nauseum). Supertramp burst forth here, Union Jack waving sure and proud, with a most excellent radio pop album. Production was first class, a wall of sound highly polished to perfection by songwriter Richard Palmer and engineer Richard Black, who insisted the album be recorded during the overnight hours of 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. due to a superstition within the band. Breakfast in America went on to yield four US Billboard hit singles and 2 Grammy awards in 1980.<br />Breakfast In America features a number of songs played on the Wurlitzer electric piano. Six of the ten tracks have the Wurlitzer on them.<br />Breakfast In America became Supertramp's biggest-selling album with more than 6 million copies sold in the US alone and was No. 1 on Billboard's Pop Albums Chart for six weeks in the spring and summer of 1979. Musical redemption, at least in 1979, had been realized.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|As my title would indicate, this is awesome for anyone who is a big fan of the movie.  Both the theatrical (with narration by Harrison Fort) and the directors cut (without the narration).  Plus typical bonus material.  If you aren't hooked into Blue-ray yet, this is perfect, as it is also not on Blue-ray here, and the cost is lower.
B00933JL0A|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME!!!!!!! Well, besides minecraft. I already have the limit of towns. I bought this thinking it was going to be just a impossible boss battle game like your army against an unstoppable army of guys on horses with axes. BUT ITS NOT!!!!! ITS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Does exactly as it says it does - simple and effective, and even better as it is free.<br />Would recommend to anyone.
B00A86AIAI|5.0|Love the look of the piece,the detail is incredible.I'm really enjoying collecting the complete set of the 52 ArtFX characters.
B00CO8D3G4|1.0|A re-hash of the worlds oldest philosophies and most common sense advice. A wasted 2hr and 46 minute read.  But harmless for all the soulless hordes in our society.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I became a Crossfire fan right after I finished the Grays series.  It's by far better, and Entwined is the best so far!  I love Eva and Gideon and feel their love grow to a whole new level in this book.  One thing that bothered me about Reflected is their lack of time together...Entwined is all about them!  And boy, is it HOT!!  I feel each shows their love for one another and EACH deserves each other.  Both continue to prove themselves and trust each other.  It them against the world!  Five books other reviews has said sounding disappointed???  Bring it on as I never want their story to end!!  I'd buy 10 if she takes us that far.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|While I absolutely loved Fever Dream, I'm a little less in love with its sequels.  In terms of the Helen Trilogy, I'd put Fever Dream first, then Two Graves, then Cold Vengeance.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story but some of Pendergast's antics in terms of catching up and combating the &#34;bad guys&#34; was pretty crazy.  I think this trilogy had Pendergast doing more outrageous things than any of the other trilogies and so it's a bit less believable.  Overall though, it was nice see more of his house, his family, his background, and his relationships which to me is some of the most enjoyable reading.  I feel like we learned a lot more about him in Two Graves and so I like the book, and the Helen Trilogy as a whole.  It's an interesting concept.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like the easy ones to learn how to play--and the challenging ones to tickle my brain.  Good for playing on the road, as a passenger of course.
B003L7DK74|5.0|Oh, how I wish this show had gone on for a few more seasons.  While it was still on the air, I caught an episode, but wasn't really feeling it for some reason.  After I got the Kindle Fire, I noticed it was free on Amazon prime instant video, and tried watching it again.  Completely addicted.  Adorable, absurd, and unique.  My boyfriend and I quote weird stuff from this show all the time.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|All the battery pro does is showed what your power is and a quick link to your phone battery settings. What a waste of time!
B001E5CH0G|5.0|I didn't see this movie right when it came out, and I sort of resisted it for a while after it started showing up on TV, even though I love Will Ferrell.  I just hate seeing Christmas movies that are so obviously intended to become classics that wind up completely missing the mark.  This movie manages to be endearing to both adults and children, which is no easy feat.  Adorable and funny, a new classic.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was looking for a new book series for the start of summer and came across the Silo Saga.  I couldn't wait to start reading each night.  I couldn't put the Kindle down.  I can't wait until August to see what happens next in Silos 17 and 18!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This movie is a classic.  I can practically recite it from memory.  If someone tells me that they don't like this movie, I seriously contemplate whether the person is worth knowing.  How could you not like this movie?  So many memorable scenes.
193700788X|1.0|I was a devoted reader from the beginning.  I was so sad to see it come to this. And this last book was not when the downward spiral began in my opinion, however this was the worst.  The entire thing felt rushed and pushed and unnatural.  And in fact, as readers, I don't feel we were given real closure.  :(
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I was looking for a high speed charger and cable to go with it.  This company advertised them for much less than others and I gave them a try.  Items were received way before expected date and so far work perfectly.  I am happy with this transaction
B000FC0P9E|4.0|It's Stephen King, and it's a good story.  Survival kind of like the Hunger Games, but without the other &#34;killers&#34; out there, only, what is out there?  All very interesting reading.  Quick read and worth it.
B00004U45G|5.0|Sure it isnt Robert Plant but Chris Robinson sounds great,They did a great job with Jimmy Page,Recommend this cd for Zep fans.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|This film brings awareness to the control that a few companies have over what really goes into our food and the process for growing and producing food. I found it very eye opening, and has personally caused me to want to buy organic or even start my own little garden.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I had seen the play and didn&#34;t know if I would like the movie, but they followed the play quite well and the actors were wonderful. They showed the emotions so well and I highly recommend seeing this movie.
B002M3GPOI|5.0|This is the very best King Crimson album imho. Greg Lake's vocals are superb and this album is a must have for anyone who loves progressive rock. This album and Days of Future Passed by the Moody Blues are by far my favorites of all times. I would highly recommend getting this set as it is really nice.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|When I saw this &#34;Ring&#34; at the Met in New York many years ago, I fell in love with it and still am. Not only are the singers superb but the production is the kind of fairy tale that I believe the &#34;Ring&#34; basically is.<br />Although I have seen a few other &#34;Rings&#34; in the meantime, there is nothing more moving than the end of this particular  &#34;Walkuere&#34; when Wotan condemns Bruennhilde to be put to sleep on a rock: James Morris's smooth, golden voice along with the outstanding one of Hildgard Behrens have never been bettered by anybody else I have heard.<br />Every other &#34;Ring&#34; I have seen has had to conform to the director's &#34;concept&#34; - even the new one at the Met that, maybe, comes closer to this than all others available.<br />However, if you want to experience the essence of the &#34;Ring&#34;, without gimmicks but with exceptional singing throughout and possibly Wagner's soul, this is the &#34;Ring&#34; to get.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|pure, genuine, unmediated, innocent, ethereal, heartfelt, non-commercial. I cannot stop playing this album  I am looking forward to the new works by Grimes.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|I am an inveterate Jonas Kaufmann fan and so far, I have bought most everything he has recorded and have never been disappointed.<br />Kaufmann is an exceptionally gifted singer and on this - as on all other CDs and DVDs - he gives his all and his all is simply superb.<br />Can I highly recommend it? You bet.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I laughed and also really enjoyed the originality of this comedy-horror flick. The story, acting, directing, ad writing was very well done. I will purchase this movie for sure.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I use this app frequently and I love it. I have not found any problems with it. One of the best, most useful apps I have found.
B00881VLCE|4.0|well made, wish you could have option of rotating non horizontal layout. puzzles are pretty good good selection to chose from
1475143389|5.0|This book has pretty much everything you need to follow a good workout routine and nutrition plan. The book is very clear in terms of explaining the nutritional aspect of getting fit as well as in explaining weight lifting technique. The book starts off with a nice background as well. Great book and I recommend it to anyone looking to get in shape.
B00987MQRQ|1.0|short and stupid. Rediculis premis and very poor explanation of content with no conjecture of theory. Quick read for anyone.
B000TERDHA|5.0|Loving this album.  These guys are quickly becoming my new favorite band.  Its a shame that I heard they arent together anymore.  Oh well.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|A really good movie, great graphic effects, keeps you intrieged , a good way to spend a wet day mellowing out
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I got this a while ago and only on level11 but I still.love it it awesome if you haven't bout it do it I'm13
0767812166|5.0|A great movie, full of fun and good humour, a really great movie for the family, lots of laughs.. go for it !
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I chose 5 stars because Mr. Martel has a wonderful way with words in describing the surroundings, the feeling of the moment, and I felt like I was there.  I have not finished the book yet because I have been tied up doing other things but I will finish it and you could ask me again later!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Why do you have to make me sign up for something to play multiplayer? It's so stupid! Why man, why?!
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I'll admit, when I started this book (it was one of our office Book Club selections), I was dismayed to see how money-centric Tony was. But, as I read through this book, found he was evolving from Mr-Money-is-Everything to a &#34;let's have fun while we're here&#34; kind of a guy. Being the latter, I found myself identifying with Tony in several cases.<br /><br />This is not a pompous read, as some other &#34;CEO-written&#34; tomes are. I felt as if I was having a beer with Tony, as he was describing his ascension from money-driven to culture-driven.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to leaders looking to affect cultural change in the workplace.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|The film is excellent.  I will be sharing it and recommending it to others. The material is good and Josh did a great job on research.
B00BLCHZC2|3.0|This show was kind of slow to get moving, but once I got into it I loved it - love the viking ship builder - he is nuts
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day is a great writer. There were so many twists and turns I couldn't put it down. I am glad it didn't end because I look forward to the continuing story, Good job Sylvia.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|This movie takes you typical as zombie movie and flips the script. Zombies actually have thoughts and feelings, but just can't change their flesh-eating ways. Overall, a good switch from your normal zombie flick.
B008L5FFP6|5.0|Great cd,<br />I can hear lots of influence from Incubus and Kings of Leon.<br />Love the song Bones, thought it was Brandon from Incubus first time I heard it....
B002LAM7PI|4.0|Watched this with my daughter. Its good creepy fun! If you liked the nightmare before christmas then you'll like this.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|Started the movie with my wife, we had seen the &#34;arnold&#34; version, but turned this one off after about 30 minutes.  It seemed tastless, and the gore was for the sake of gore not drama, the sex for the sake of, well nothing, it was just there!
B005HWUBZ0|4.0|I like Mayer Hawthorne's musical style.  I first caught him on a PBS late night concert.  I would recommend Mayer Howthorne's music to many more if some of the &#34;bad&#34; words would change. I enjoy singing along to music, but I have had to watch it with a few of these.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|so far I like this game a lot, its like empires and allies on facebook, but besides that the game play is really nice
B00BEXB18M|4.0|After hearing the title track I was a little worried about this album, but after listening to it a couple of times it is not that bad.  A couple of the songs I can live without, but three of them are some of Dave Mustaine's best work I think, Kingmaker, Dance In the Rain, and Don't Turn Your Back.  I still prefer older Megadeth songs but Dave still knows how to make good music.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan s one of the best author's about Greek stuff. He makes you like you ate right there with the people in the book.
B000062Y98|5.0|I have been waiting for a long time to get a copy of this album and it was worth the wait.  I have been listening to this album non stop for about a week now because every time I listen to it I hear something new.  I cannot pick a favorite song from this album because they are all good song.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This was a gift to my daughter and she loved it, like anything from Rod Stuart, and is playing it all the time, in the house and in the car.
B004FCEFUK|5.0|I bought this after hearing Tommy Karevik on the new Kamelot album.  I was very impressed by his abilities and I wanted to hear more if his stuff.  There is a difference between his voice for Kamelot and for Seventh Wonder and I prefer his voice on this album, very powerful and addicting.  All the songs on this album are great, especially The Great Escape.  I love listening to longer songs and this one is one of the best I have heard in a long time.
B00632HWOG|4.0|A little hard to respond to emails but great for keeping caught up email and a lot easier to read than with the phone apps.  I use this one quite frequently and overall am rather pleased with it.
B008220C56|3.0|not at all what I expected.  Must take a true cinema artista to appreciate.  Acting was superb, but perspective was strange.  No I did not get it.
