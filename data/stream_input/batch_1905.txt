B000007XUQ|5.0|Everybody who doesn't have this set should get it for next Christmas! The CDs are that good! These songs are beautiful as background music for the holidays.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I now play Spider Solitaire on my laptop but installed this version on my Kindle.  It is interesting and I enjoy playing it.  Since it is free, the price is right!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game because it keeps me occupied and focus. I can relax while playing it. I recommend it.

B005SAJJHM|5.0|enjoy this show and having it on demand is worth the price. a show you can watch over and over
B00881VLCE|3.0|pretty good. freezes sometimes. the side bar with all the  pieces is somewhat irritating. it isn't as fluid as I would like and takes a few tries to slide up or down. it always thinks I'm trying to grab pieces.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I chose this rating because i love romantic comedies but also i believe in destiny however i dont feel that fate should be tested, I would recommend this movie to all young couples in love!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was very excited to read a book from JK Rowling since the end of the Harry Potter series.  Unfortunately, this book  went nowhere fast and I finally put it down after 100 pages.  Too wordy with lengthy descriptions about everything unimportant--- very disappointing.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|This one Is absolutely one for the whole family! It displays love,understanding,commitment,and the importance of being with your family as well as listening to each other
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I've always enjoyed Orwellian sort of post apocalyptic stories and this did not disappoint.  It was actually better than I expected based on some other teen fiction I found barely palatable (as in this was WAY better than twilight!)  Read it for free with my prime membership so even better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|could NOT put this book down. i am a HUGE Nicholas Sparks fan! I cant wait for this movie... the ending threw me off! i highly recommend this book! :)
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|After extensive troubleshooting I discovered that Amazon didn't bother to include 5.1 audio. Shame on them.  It was a very expensive rental.  I won't make the mistake of renting from them again.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|It was a good book I finished it in 3 days it was very very very short and I loved the movie
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It almost destroyed my kindle fire.A word of advice if get the game be careful how much you play it or else...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book!  Could not stop reading it!  Finally figured out what all of the hype was about!!!  Now off to rent the movie!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Great addition to the Bourne movie series. Action packed, non-stop thriller that is everything great about the Bourne movies. Additionally will lead right into the next movie of the series.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Funny and a great plot Seth McFarland is very funny this is a adult movie and the acting is good
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|For a free version it provides all the same play challenges of one to pay for.  We like Angry Birds of  all kinds.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|I have been building a gaming rig and choose this processor as a start. What is excellent about this processor is the power comsumption and the hyper threading feature.<br />PROS:<br />- The hyper threading feature allows you simulate two more cores at fast speeds, is being recognized for some programs as a 4 core cpu.. The 3.3 ghz on this baby make it very fast!!<br />-  The temperature is not high at all but I have it with an aftermarket NZXT respire T20 and it idles at 28-31 C and while gaming it reaches 48C as a maximun that I have recorded. (Awesome) The stock fan was at 31-33C in idle and reached 54C while gaming. So you can compare.<br />- It does not bottleneck my AMD Radeon XFX 7850, I have played games like Hitman absolution, Dishonored, Torchlight 2, COD black OPS 1 and 2, Dirt 3, Mass effect 3, all of them at the highest settings without lag.<br />- If you do not have a dedicated video card, the Intel Hd graphics 2500 perform very good. I was able to play movies at 1080p and to stream them to my PS3 using the PS3 media server, and all the movies played fine.<br />- The integrated 2500 graphics are for casual gaming, but I played before DMC 4, dishonored, dirt 2 and medium to high settings but in 1280x600. You need to tweak a little bit the settings.<br />- Excellent processor for multitasking and daily basis computer programs.<br />- It scores 7.2 in windows experience in Windows 7 ultimate.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Not a good processor if your stuff is video editing. Although this processor is good and fast at it, you might need an i5 or i7.<br />- It might give you lag while playing Battlefield 3 multiplayer, since that game is very processor demanding. But the single player story runs fine.<br /><br />I highly recommend this processor for anyone building a gaming rig and for daily basis tasks.
B008XCPO2Q|1.0|I bought it for my wife for her birthday  and I thought it sucked. My wife also thinks it sucked and might have given it two stars instead of my one.  There isn't much to say except that it was a really shallow movie without enough man candy for the wife.  They tried to do too much with this movie and without any famous names in it, it would have been straight to dvd if it they made it at all.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I thought I was just going to be laughing like crazy, but I found myself shedding a tear as well!
B003XVYLDU|4.0|This is such an entertaining book. It's parceled Into little cheeky segments and mix fact, science fiction, family connection and the fourth dimension together delightfully.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Hysterical! Saw this in the theatre and absolutely had to see it again. Thanks, Amazon Prime!  Was even better the second time.  Especially Fat Amy's \\"secret\\" confession!!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This story has everything needed in a classic piece of literature. There is drama, laughter, sorrow and love. All sewn together in an uplifting storyline. Truly this one of my favorite reads of all time.
B004LWZW9C|2.0|I didn't really like this movie. Valentine's Day is much better. Rent this movie first to see if you like it.
0761169431|5.0|My 10 year old Star Wars fan was super excited to find out he can make the ships using paper.  Also includes some trivia questions.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Don't let kids near this in any way. Full of pointless cuss words and sexual references.  Incredibly pointless stupid movie.  Only point is now you will know how screwed up of a life you would have if you wished your teddy bear was alive, and you somehow still end up with a girl like Mila. Not possible.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie. Makes you appreciate life. Would recommend to anyone. Bought this as a gift for Christmas.  ( why is there a word requirement for reviews?)
B00571F26Y|5.0|He's been on insulin for over 6 months and had not been able to lower his sugar levels belowd 200. He is now regularly recording levels to 175 and even lower. This is with also reducing his insulin by half. He is under a doctor's care while he is going through this plan. The new cookbook is also excellent to use in following this new eating plan.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This video offers an awesome workout. Whenever I start this program up again after a break, I am so sore I can hardly walk or breathe which to me means it challenges me and makes me use those muscles I need to. It's only a 20 minute workout that takes 1/2 hour with the warm up and cool down so you don't get bored with it.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Amazing, as expected! Can't stop reading these comics. They are genius. Highly recommended for all walking dead fans out there!
B002APU580|5.0|Captures the essence of the story in 2 hours. Good for my High School students even though I love the longer Colin Firth version too (but who has 6 hours in an English class?)  For a great Pride and Prejudice weekend, watch this one, then the 6 hour one and then the 3 hour spoof Lost in Austen. Perfect Girl weekend!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I was really hoping for more aliens.  It's kind of related to the other Alien movies, but just barely.  I feel they could have done more to connect it.  It was okay, especially if you like sci-fi like I do.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some games are good, but too many are just ok.  I give it 2 weeks and I won't play it anymore
0439023513|4.0|daughter got this book as a gift and she said she liked it. She said she cant wait to read the other books in the serials.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Once you get pulled into the story, the characters become very real. Although I wish Alex was more developed, Hana and Lena seem like girls you know. Slow to start, but the last 25% pays off. I feel like I must read book 2 now.
0439023491|4.0|we got this for our daughter as a gift and she said she liked the book and cant wait to read the other one in the serials.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Cary Grant AND Princess Grace?  Consider this one great by any measurement.  Cary Grant is a former, rehabilitated jewel thief.  Now, similar robberies are occurring that point to Grant.  With the help of Socialite Grace Kelly, Grant goes on the prowl in an effort to clear his name in this superb film by Alfred Hitchcock, a must for any movie buff...
0345803485|5.0|bought this as a gift for daughter and she loved it ,cant wait to read the other books in the series she said
0385474547|5.0|The book looked brand new and it helped that it was a low price. It arrived on time and with the proper paperwork.
0241951453|5.0|A really great cover for a classic book.  While rather different from the movie, Capote's novella never fails to impress!
B0025X4OYI|5.0|Ground-breaking, historic, beautiful work. My all-time favorite album. It's my third copy of this album, I just flat wore out the plastic album, scrached my first DVD, and so this one I've saved twice.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|once you start reading this triology, you cannot put it down. you just want to know what hapened next! the best book ever
B006H5120E|5.0|I got more than my moneys worth.  Problem is my tv wasn't 3D ready as I was told in the store so I can't use the 3D but it also included a blu-ray disk so we did get to watch the movie.  Certainly not the stores fault all the reviews on the web said my TV was 3D ready when it wasn't..  Enjoyed the movie and the special features disc
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I love Whitney! The Cd came nicely packaged. I didn't have any problems at all with playing it in my cd player. Wonderful price!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I saw Of Monsters and Men perform 'Mountain Sound' on Jay Leno the other night.<br /><br />I really liked their sound and decided to get the album. I'm glad I did!!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Again, I read too fast and now the long wait for another Jack Reacher novel.  The story line, characters and trivia information are all classic Reacher fare.  Too hard to put the book down to get anything else done.  Bravo!  The only problem I encountered in the book was the incongruous choice of Tom Cruise to play Reacher in the movie.  The more I read, the more it seems an extremely curious choice.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"I've been looking for you my whole damn life.\\"<br /><br />If you think you know what this book is about, think again. If you think you can guess where the story might take you, think again. If you think you have any idea of how monumental of an impact this book is going to have on you, think again. There is nothing predictable or clich&eacute; about this storyline or its characters. This is possibly the most originally daring and skilfully executed plot I have come across in a very long time. I walked out of this experience dishevelled, emotionally bulldozered, feeling like I had just been shot out of a cannon. Bruises and all. And I loved every single moment of it.<br /><br />This is the story about a bright little star in the endless sky that is life. Sky is a seventeen year old girl, an ordinary girl with a somewhat sheltered life up to that point, with the usual teenage issues, but with a personality that reflects her lack of intense social interaction. Sky is honest, loving, devoted and loyal, she often speaks her mind without weighing her words too much, she does not try to conform but rather embraces her uniqueness. The only thing that is different about Sky is her reaction to intimate touch - Sky blanks out, completely blocking out all feelings and emotions, and her mind drifts to her happy place where she is counting stars in the sky and waiting until the experience is over. Having no vivid memory from her past that could have caused her such a reaction, she accepts it as her body's innate inability to `feel' anything when she should be feeling everything.<br /><br />After being home-schooled her whole life, Sky decides to spend her last year of high school among her peers. She is quickly thrown into a teenager's version of Hell with rumours, spitefulness, envy, pranks, marginalisation becoming daily occurrences in her life. But none of it touches Sky as she was not raised to let those things matter to her. She brushes it all off, completely ignoring the rumour-mill and focusing on those people in her life who see her for whom she really is.<br /><br />And then one day she meets Holder, a boy that comes with his own set of rumours and warning bells. Everything about their first encounter confuses Sky - his reaction to her, the unusual questions he asks her, but above all, her body's reaction to him. He seems to ignite the flame in her that she always believed not to have.<br /><br />\\"... how have I not seen him before? How could I not know I lived less than three miles from the only boy in existence who can turn me into a ball of frustrated hot-flashes?\\"<br /><br />The more time they spend together, the more her need for him becomes physical. In one of the most beautifully woven tales of falling in love for the first time and falling in lust for the first time, we watch a delightful game of seduction between two souls that seem to naturally gravitate towards each other.<br /><br />\\"I feel like I had that with you the moment we met. Everything about us is so natural. It feels like we're already there, and we're trying to go backward now. Like we're trying to re-get to know each other by slowing it down.\\"<br /><br />Holder is gentle, patient, loving towards her. Their falling in love with each other is so exquisitely paced - we feel every heartbeat, every skipped breath, every nuance in their growing connection. He awakens her body, makes her feel loved and cherished, and by doing so, breaks the barriers in Sky's mind.<br /><br />\\"Sky, I'm not kissing you tonight but believe me when I tell you, I've never wanted to kiss a girl more. So stop thinking I'm not attracted to you because you have no idea just how much I am. You can hold my hand, you can run your fingers through my hair, you can straddle me while I feed you spaghetti, but you are not getting kissed tonight. And probably not tomorrow, either. I need this. I need to know for sure that you're feeling every single thing that I'm feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\\"<br /><br />But this is not what this story is all about.<br /><br />In one of the most unexpected plot twists ever manoeuvred, we are suddenly thrown out of the water, gasping for air, wondering when Ms Colleen Hoover became such a literary rally champion and why we weren't at the crowning ceremony! I don't care how much imagination you have, you will never guess where this story takes us. It is compelling, it is emotional and it is real. This happy ending comes with a hefty price to pay and I was happy to pay with every single tear I shed.<br /><br />The second part of the book will have you holding your breath, gripping your chair, biting your nails until they hurt. It is everything a good book should be like and then so much more. Sky and Holder will intertwine themselves into your heart so deeply that you will never want to let them go. This is a story of indescribable courage, perseverance, pure unadulterated love, but also all the ugliness that life sometimes brings as well. It will change you, transform you, move you, kick you, heal you, make you believe. It is a must-read for anyone with a pulse.<br /><br />On a starry night, look up in the sky and count the stars - THAT is how many stars this book deserves!<br /><br />\\"The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down. I'm choosing to stand up taller. I'll probably get knocked down a few more times before this life is through with me, but I can guarantee you I'll never stay on the ground.\\"Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\\"<br /><br />But this is not what this story is all about.<br /><br />In one of the most unexpected plot twists ever manoeuvred, we are suddenly thrown out of the water, gasping for air, wondering when Ms Colleen Hoover became such a literary rally champion and why we weren't at the crowning ceremony!

B0063B2BNE|5.0|I watched this season on Amazon instant video because I missed it during the regular season.  One of my very favorite shows.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This DVD held the attention of my 4-year-old grandson.  He loved it so much that he wanted me to read the book to him right away.
B0096DZKZC|3.0|I personally was not very fond of this game in general. the graphics look fantastic and the sonic feeling is all there, but it's not too pleasant to play. the game is not in full screen for some odd reason, giving off a strange cinematic vibe to it that it completely mis-fitting to the sonic series and just becomes plain annoying not being able to use the whole screen. the controls are severely loose and you constantly fall off platforms and objects whenever trying to stand still. there is little to no feeling of speed, and when you do get the speed, it's boggled down by terrible homing mechanics that seem to make little sense. It rarely locks on to what you want it to, and when it does, the loose controls make you fall off the platform you were aiming for in the first place.<br /><br />Not to mention, the whole gameplay revolves around these gimmicky moves that allow you to fly and break into stuff using tail as your ally. this is all fine and dandy, but most of the time the game requires you to use these moves only in short sections of the level, leaving the rest of the mechanics hanging around for no reason other than to slow down the experience.<br /><br />Overall, I was sorely disappointing with this entry in the sonic franchise. if the controls were much more responsive and some of the gameplay kinks were ironed out like the widescreen display or the gimmicky move-set, then this would be a much more respectable title to recommend. sadly though, it's not worth the time.
0395389496|5.0|Having already watched the DVD, my grandson wanted me to read this book to him.  He was glued to the story and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game! it's a complete blast from start to finish, with plenty of innovation to spare. It's exactly like the console counter part, only the controls are split up by the levels. some are jumping, others are flying, and some punching and so on. it's absolutely ingenious, and still completely feels like rayman origins from the bottom up, without any frustrating touch layouts. It makes me so happy to play a game like this, knowing it just isnt a lazy port slapped together for extra cash. the graphics are crisp and clean, looking as good, if not better, than the console counter parts it was based off of.<br /><br />However, no gem is completely untarnished, here are my reasons why:<br /><br />1: the levels revolve around collecting all the lums in a level, which just makes it frustrating. there is no leniency in the levels, making it so that you can not even miss a single one to earn a tooth to get the secret difficult level (which you need 5). this just leads to frustration and restricts your freedom with the games mechanics, which run perfectly.<br /><br />2: sometimes the game can slow down severely, running down to a near 5 frames per second. this doesn't occur often, and possibly only on the kindle fire, but it should be noted.<br /><br />3: there is no character selection, which is all opinion, but I think some people would want to play as globox or a tensie from the console counter part.<br /><br />4: sometimes the music can get slightly repetitive, and can loop the same tracks regardless of what stage or how far in the game you are, makes the whole thing feel a little more repetitive on top of trying to capture every single lum in each level.<br /><br />Even with these flaws, it's an easy recommendation to anyone who has a device that can run this game. it's easily one of my favorite portable games, period.
B005XN31LY|5.0|great video on amazon and amazon prime. great for disney people who love the characters and stories. It is great
B007C7UZIG|5.0|What more is there to be said, it's steam on your tablet, how cool is that?! There is little to no difference here from the PC version, which I like! I am very satisfied with how it runs, looks, and functions, definitely a worthy part of my app library. if you have a steam account but haven't gotten this yet, then please just download this.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|i love this show, i rewatch it all the time and this product is great for that! the dvd was a great buy
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I love this downloader, it's very well made and professional. this would easily be a five star if it weren't for 2 things:<br /><br />1: the advertisements at the bottom of the screen are very irritating and right in the way of the browser.<br /><br />2: when you watch a video in full screen, the app takes forever to let you out of the video when you click the back button. I have no idea why, but it just won't let you out of the video for a good 20 seconds or so, if you're unlucky.<br /><br />If you can ignore those faults, please download this player, it's a godsend and works brilliantly.
B008K8U13K|5.0|this is the same game as the sega version from back in the day! my boyfriend spent half the day playing it!
B007OWRBJK|5.0|If you've lived through the music from the early sixties you will love this historical account.  Townshend is a true pioneer of rock.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great app. Basic original version of the game. Would give five stars,but some tile matches (flowers) hard to figure out, and no explanations. Lots of fun, works well on my Kindle fire HD.
B005K2YTG4|4.0|To be honest, the price is what attracted me to this. Wasn't ready yet to pay the $40 for the popular Kindle Paperwhite cover. In its defense, its a perfect way to protect the reader while in transit. Sturdily built, its hard enough that not much is going to directly impact the reader inside. It has a velcro clasp for the flap. The inside is pretty soft, and the size of this is tailor made for the Kindle.<br /><br />However, it was not what I was looking for. It was too stiff and bulky for my tastes. I guess I didn't take the &#34;ballistic&#34; description to heart. This sleeve is made of multiple layers, and with the reader inside, the side with the flap is very thick. In my opinion, the Kindle only JUST fit in the sleeve; maybe it needed to be worn in a bit. The velcro closure is annoying and loud.<br /><br />A good sleeve, but not for me.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Love this! Stephanie is very quirky,she amazes every time!can not wait to read the next book in the series! Have fun!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|just wish he wrote more himself and published more frequently.  Heck a few more books and he can buy the SD Chargers and keep them in SD
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Can hardly wait to receive the second season.  Such quality scripts and great acting. Definitely deserves an Emmy in all categories.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Keeps Kindle Fire ... Computer ... Ipod Touch all synced to perfection. Makes life easier. Everyone needs this app. Wish I had installed this app much earlier!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Great Christmas Album.  Have enjoyed it immensely this holiday season.  Rod Stewart's voice is great for listening to holiday favorites.  Love the duets.
030758836X|5.0|Hard to put this one down.  Interesting twist to the story and written really well.  Definitely a book to get!
0143121006|5.0|Great true story with insights into the history of the era.  Amazing how persistent the father of the victim was.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|LOVE IT! ADDICTED TO IT! NEED MORE GAMES LIKE THIS! HELPS WITH HAND AND EYE COORDINATION. Can play all day and night!
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Thank you Pixar/Disney - I am 40 and I have a blast with this movie each year.  Thank you for all the hard work on this movie!
B007PJFIU6|4.0|Got this game as a gift. Absolutely stunned by the gameplay. It was easy for my entire family (5) to play. I would give this game 5 stars except for the fact that there are only 84 cards and you learn them quickly. Although there are expansions, i think that they are poorly done and will wait till another pack comes out from this artist.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Who doesn’t love a wallflower heroine with underlying spunk and a handsome Duke who sees past the shirking flower exterior? Don’t miss this fun read!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This type of book is so far from what I usually read, but it was very interesting and thoughtful. Defiantly a book you have to experience on your own, everyone will get something different from reading It.  It makes you think about things.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This for me is without a doubt the best game on the vita right now. All my gaming devices other than the vita are gathering dust right now because of this game. Story is very interesting, music is amazing, characters are very likable. It's really hard to find any faults to this game. Hope they announce persona 5 soon.
B005IS564E|5.0|At the time we purchased this, it also came with a free mail-in t-shirt. I'm not sure if that would still apply since that was a while ago, but the album is excellent regardless. Definitely worth the money. It even came on time. Whoo!
B008MIMWOO|5.0|I love this series and the price was shagedelic baby. My inner Dr. Evil came out and I shagged it.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This show is great and I bought the second season for my boyfriend since he already has the first. We enjoy watching it together, so it is definitely worth owning! Now we can enjoy it for years to come. Also, it arrived on time and was brand new. I am very pleased with this purchase.
B00127RAJY|4.0|if you are honest and give it all you got, it will shred the inches away.  give it a try.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I would probably rate this show as one of my all-time favorites and I was very excited when Season 8 premiered, Luckily for me, Amazon has online some of the episodes that i was unfortunate enough to miss. Yay! The show is awesome and Amazon is to thank for having Supernatural's new season available. I am very pleased and excited!
B009HELT3C|4.0|Pretty good. Way better than the last one.  I would not buy the DVD, or pay to rent it (I had some free credits from Amazon), but it is worth a couple hours of your life to see it.  Had some good chuckles and, as usual, some great special effects. Acting was excellent.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This movie is spectacular and it was just as described. It also came on time, so we are very pleased with this purchase.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i like it. only problem is that everything costs too much. watch out. you could really max oyt your account.
B004SEUIWY|5.0|This movie is quite excellent and it came on time and as described. We are very pleased with this purchase.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|The dvd case was cracked in the corner but played just fine, but the dvd was shipped very fast .
B001NLKT60|5.0|i loved this book and the other two in the series. just wish there could be some more in the series.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas classics in film. Especially,the 1938 version. The book was a great read. Made me appreciate the film even more. If you like intriguing short stories,then this one is for you.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|i love leonardo dicaprio and most of his movies and i really liked this movie . it had a lot of different turns.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book but repeated a lot of the stuff, but kept me wanting to read more and I couldn't stop
159562015X|5.0|I was amazed at the research behind the concepts in this book. I feel that the assessment was spot on and others agreed. Worth every penny!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Plot holes were much more noticable. The villans motivation was even less clear and just because every one kept saying that Miranda Tate was\is very attractive does not make it so. Anne Hathaway was better than I thought she would be. Her weight went up and down over the course of the movie. I thought she looked more like Cat Woman when she was a little heavier. All in all a good movie but not one for multiple vieings.
B008MM9630|5.0|It is amazingly cute and spunky and fun. Every girl out there of all ages will love playing this game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I stayed up reading this book until 5:30 in the morning because I could not put it down.  I slept for awhile and then went right back to it.  I simply loved this book.<br /><br />From the beginning of this story I was hooked.  It didn't take a number of chapters for this book to get to me.  When Sky was talking about Six's decision to become a foreign exchange student, I was so sad that she wouldn't have her bestie at her side for her first day of school.  Then when Sky met Holder at the store, I just knew there was something more to the story. And I wanted to find out!<br /><br />The character development in this story was fabulous.  I loved everyone in this story. Well, not EVERYone...you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />I admit that when we were first introduced to Breckin I was concerned that he was going to turn out to be Holder and he wasn't how I pictured at all!  But when he turned out to be Breckin, he was perfect!  I loved his candor and his attitude and the alliance stuff cracked me up.<br /><br />I don't want to fill this review with spoilers because I want everyone to just go out and read it for themselves.  But I feel that I would be remiss if I didn't point out what I loved most about this book:<br /><br />**truly the \\"best first kiss\\" ever<br />**loved the slight reference to The Sea of Tranquility<br />**loved the gift of the ereader<br />**loved the banter between Sky and Holder and their \\"insulting\\" texts<br />**loved the trip to the flea market and the useless items<br />**loved the reason behind his tattoo<br />**loved that both of them are runners<br /><br />In summation, I loved this book!  It made me feel happy and sad and anxious and furious.  Sky and Holder were meant for each other and their connection was so natural and beautiful.  I was rooting for them from the beginning.  Holder was maybe a tad bit wise beyond his years but it worked.  They worked.<br /><br />It's books like this that remind me why I love reading so much.  This is my 80th book for 2012 and I think it's a great one to top off the year.  It doesn't get any better than this.  It's the kind of book that you don't want to put down because you have to know what happens next, but then when you finish reading you're a little sad that you're finished.  I felt like that tonight. Then I remembered the \\"gift\\" Colleen Hoover left on her blog--a pivotal scene told from Holder's point of view!  I was so excited to have a little extra piece of these characters to enjoy.  Of course it was a definitely a yummy addition!<br /><br />I'd like to end with a word about Colleen Hoover.  I think if we lived near each other, we'd be besties.  I follow Colleen's blog and not only is she a fabulous writer, she seems to be a genuinely really terrific (and funny) person.  I have found that authors can really endear themselves (or not!) to their readers by how they conduct themselves on social media.  Colleen is a class act!  I am so amazed by this woman. To think she came up with the idea for her first book only a year ago in November and now has three books under her belt. I am truly thankful for independent publishing and social media for making it possible to read Colleens fabulous words.  She's definitely on my list of auto-buy authors!  I cannot wait to read what she brings us next!h book for 2012 and I think it's a great one to top off the year.  It doesn't get any better than this.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It's a great game And fun to play when I'm bored. I hope other people feel the same way about it.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|I'm on the security side of the tech industry and these books are completly plausable.  Daniel Suarez has done a great job of tying in real world capabilites into an excellent read.  Highly reccomend the books but don't blame me if you come out more paranoid.  I know I did.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Beautifully written. So enticing, I can't put it down. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series. This book was awesome.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I was overly impressed with the total series. Should be made in 3D if it is ever redone. Thank You
B005HSL626|5.0|This is an easy and fun game to play if you have a fast finger.  It's appropriate for all ages.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Yes, it's formulaic. Yes, you've taken the trip before but the stops along the way are pretty funny. The singing is pretty good also. One of my favorite comedies from 2012!
B005LAIISU|5.0|This is worth the cost, especially when you purchase the digital copy.  We have a Roku and have been able to take full advantage of the Vudu where all of our digital movies are stored, with the exception of the Disney films.  Vudu has allowed us to placed digital copies that can be viewed on laptops, desktops, roku player, blu-ray players, PS3 or any other media device.  Each child can watch a different movie and on their time.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Great adventure story for the whole family.  My 14 year old says \\"It is funny, yet suspenseful.\\"  Her little brothers loved every single second.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|passes the time quite well. not very hard to level and enough to keep you busy. recommend this hems tor older people children might not get it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A great first hand account of not only what happened but seal training in general as well as descriptions of other missions. The account is raw, not written by a professional writer. This could be the only negative.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|Not as good as the 3 previous Bourne movies but kept my interest.  Renner is very god and there is an awesome motorcycle chase.  Worth a rent at least.
B004LQJPEG|4.0|DEFINITELY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST.  IT CONTAINS SO MANY DIFFERENT FACETS THAT ONE WANTS TO VIEW IT SEVERAL TIMES OVER, JUST SO THAT YOU HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is really good! It gives me something to do and gets harder as you start to get the game which I really like. If you are looking for a fun game to pass some time that does not get boring after a while this is it. There is no question about it! It is a really fun game!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This version of Uno is pretty jacked up.  It has the weirdest rules I have ever seen.  It only vaguely resembles the wonderful card game we played growing up.  I'm still not quite sure how I managed to do it but I did manage to win. The new &quot;rule&quot; I find most odd and distasteful is when you have 2 cards left and they make you switch hands with a player that has 15 cards.  So not cool!!!  I got the game for free so I'll keep it but just wanted to warn others.  If you are expecting the game to play like the real life game, you might find your money better spent on Phase 10 or Scrabble.<br /><br />Hope this review helps others.
0307346617|3.0|Bright and colorful (not to mention splashes of cartoon gore) WWZ  is a quick read and lots of fun. The idea is fairly straightforward: re-write [[ASIN:B000N8GX0A The Good War]] for the Zombie Apocalypse. Simple idea, but complex in execution.<br /><br />To give credit where credit is due, he pulls it off pretty well. However, there were just a few too many moments that pulled me out of my suspension of disbelief with the thought: \\"this guy must write comic books.\\" His use of dialect is journeyman-level at best: while not wholly unconvincing, it periodically rings false. Furthermore, his willingness to sacrifice consistency and plausibility (internal, course - we are talking about Zombies here, right?) in favor of spectacle is particularly grating.<br /><br />I had the same reaction to [[ASIN:0553380958 Snow Crash (Bantam Spectra Book)]] years ago, and Brooks rubs me much the same way Stephenson does: he builds an edifice packed full of weighty concepts, grand ideas and colorful vignettes, but skimps on the research to properly underlay the foundation, then braces up inconsistencies with flashy slight of hand. He also lacks the discipline to kill his darlings, which is part of what leads to the inconsistencies in the first place.<br /><br />I grant that my standard for these things is rather unreasonably high for a commercial work, and I understand the constraints of publishing economics, but I still long for a genre novel of this sort with real literary heft.<br /><br />Oh, and his French is bad too.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I had the free version before and you could barely do anything and I was just waiting for them to have it tor the free app of the day
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|And theIt is a good time spared and the best way to make sure that the leftover time isn't wasted
B009329ZF2|4.0|This flick was better than I had expected it to be, perhaps because it did so poorly in the theaters.  Perfect for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon matinee at home.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I chose this rating because it was more than an sexy book it had a good story and it was interesting and made u think
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Having a massage business with two therapists and one room, this is great as it cinks to each kindle fire so we both know when the other is booked.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|it kept you interested and kept your attention also made you want to read as bout whats going to happen next
B0053O89IS|5.0|arrived very quickly at our home, every bones fan should add this season to their collection, less episodes than previous years
B007IXWL2C|5.0|it was everything I expected and more there was interest and adventure it was descriptive and a true joy to read
0545265355|5.0|My daughter and her friends lovedthis series of books, it seems to be the in thing to read and discuss.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Saw season 1 over the holidays. Had a 5 hour marathon. Hooked, seriously. Was a bit confused, initally, but continued to watch and the gaps were filled.
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|my children found it a wonderful and inspiring movie and life story for the whole family to watch together as a family
B004LWZWGK|4.0|This is a great movie it will keep you watching it to the very end. It a bit long at almost 3 hours and it leaves you wanting more thats the only bad things i can say about the movie. If you have seen the other two batman movies then you definitely need to see this one.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|our children really enjoyed watching this movie, i heard many burst of laughter coming from the living room as they were watching
B0035JPTSQ|3.0|Ok first of all I would like to start out by saying that Supernatural is one of my favorite shows for its environment, music (which i grew up listening to), and its detail, although the way they portray angels leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The only thing that really bothers me about this show is the constant, non-stop dialogue between the brothers. Until the very last episode you can count on the SAME dialogue since episode one.  Sam: I made a mistake, I'm sorry. Dean: I don't wanna deal with it, I dont wanna talk about it.  Sam goes on to give a long, whiny, self-pitying explanation about his feelings and Dean looks like hes been on the toilet for an hour and cant get the business done.<br /><br />I think that the monster-hunting-on the road idea was excellent and that part of the writing is great, especially the variety of ghosts and monsters they run across. The writing lacks however when dealing with the emotional problems of the brothers. I feel that most, if not all, of the issues between them could have been resolved by the end of season 1 and we could have moved on to new, more interesting problems. For two brothers who are apparently as inseperable and close as they are, they sure can't stand each other and its annoying already.  Get them on the same page, make them a REAL team, Have Dean get over Sam's blood problem. Sam has a huge weapon at his disposal if Dean would stop calling him a Freak for using it.
1419705849|5.0|our son loves this series of books and he sys all his friends do too.  always a great book to give for a gift - no batteries!
0345803507|5.0|I couldn't wait for the book stores to have it - it is a great trilogy - received it fast as always and just what I ordered
1419702238|5.0|my son loves this series of kid books, always on his wish list when a new one comes out at stores
0345803493|5.0|it is hard to top book one but this is also a great book written by an amazing author= I enjoyed this book as well and got it quickly from Amazon
B0017MO10U|4.0|It was a good movie for sci fi people who have already seen the stargate series.  came to our house quickly
B008MWBY6W|5.0|AmazonBasics Holster Camera Case for DSLR Cameras is a great DSLR case. This will fit all standard size DSLR and standard zoom lens and also longer zoom lens like the 18-200mm and 70-300mm (basically most lens except the bigger f/2.8 zoom lenses). This case also has additional compartments for extra battery, memory card, or other accessories (like smaller external flash like the nikon sb-400 or smaller lens like the 50mm or 18-55mm). And most importantly, this case has good and solid padding and protects my camera and lens very well.  I have several DSLR cameras and DSLR cases and in my opinion, this AmazonBasics case is just as good as the lowepro and case logic brands.<br /><br />Sidarta Tanu
B003L77G8I|5.0|it is a must have tv season to own if you are a bones fan.  came to our house quickly
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Watched the film wit my wife.  We enjoyed the acting, graphics and plot.  It's over 2 hours in length and felt a bit long. However, reasonably true to the Disney version of snow white and entertaining. A good movie to watch when u have two hours to kill with your wife.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|It is a great movie for those sci fi people who have seen all of the stargate original series.  came fast
B008XG1X18|2.0|I deleted it because I found that in order to log in you have to go thru one of the social media websites.  I don't subscribe to any of those and am not interested in doing so.  I've got some other things to utilize my time with without that hassle.
B004XWLN20|5.0|My entire family loves this series.  We watch an episode a night together.  It teaches great lessons to the kids too.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The plot has some flaws, but overall a great story.  The Blade Runner tie-in is also pretty cool.  You must be somewhat intelligent to understand what's going on.
B005T87QCI|3.0|its really fun but even on had I beat it in 20 minutes,  it would be better if it was free:/ but overall its a good game :)
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Great album... I would give it 5 stars but the lead singer uses auto-tuning on a couple tracks; dumb considering his good voice.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|This is an awesome game. The armor is sweet, the missions are cool and the  graphics aren't that bad at all. The only thing that I dislike is the store. When I want to buy an item from there, they will automatically purchase an item upon touch which is annoying! Most games will ask you if you are sure if that is the item you want. I have lost money(gold coins) and jewels especially on items I didn't want. If problem is fix I will give this game 5 stars. Otherwise this is a good game to own since its free.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Confusing in that good way that keeps you yearning to understand. Defiantly will be added as one of my favorites.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Boys love it! haven't tried it yet. I think it is a little harder to win but that is just me.
B0064MT1QW|5.0|Ordered the package the night of the 28th and received it morning of the 31st. Great turn around during the busy holiday season.  Disk in original packaging so should work fine.
0545259096|4.0|I read this book series last year but I never had time to write a review for them. I really liked them. It's a great love story, one of those rare ''love at first sight\\" ones. It's full of mystery, and puzzles. It also had a nice ending, even though it wasn't perfect. But I recommend this book to anyone who wants to enjoy some comfortable reading time, especially to those who are in high school like me.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|I've always liked the TV shows and movies but was always coy about reading a Star Trek novel. Always thought movies and TV shows never translated well to print. This book changed all that. It was great reading about the continuing voyages of the Enterprise. I really enjoyed getting a more indepth back ground into the creation of Noonien's androids, Data, Lore, Lal and B4. The book finally explains where B4 came from and explains why he is so 'baisc' from the other series of androids, really fills those holes since the last Next Generation Movie - Nemesis.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away but if you like Star Trek you will enjoy this book and I believe it adds richly to the character development in the Star Trek universe.
0545123275|5.0|I read this book series last year but I never had time to write a review for them. I really liked them. It's a great love story, one of those rare ''love at first sight\\" ones.

I recommend this book to anyone who wants to enjoy some comfortable reading time, especially to those who are in high school like me.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I like the look and the feel of this stylus but didn't realize, because of the thick , wide bottom and working  with the smaller keyboards on the touchscreen cellphones, it had a tendency to &#34;fat-finger&#34; the letters and I would have to keep backspacing and correcting my words. Worked well with my Nexxus 7 tablet though.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is well written and researched.  The skills and survival techniques used are very authentic and appropriate for the conditions.
B009MO5960|1.0|I missed this one in the theater. I wish I hadn't. Then, I wouldn't be out the money for the Blu ray. This is going the same route as the Underworld series, change the story a little and rush out a new version. I hoped it would have been better than Resident Evil Afterlife but it wasn't. I'll skip the next one in the theater and wait until it comes out on Netflix, then I'll decide to buy it. What's with the guys with the big hammers? I guess it's a cool 3D effect to some people. Oh yeah, please don't do another in 3d. I own all 5 on Blu ray and have only watched Apocolypse and Extinction more than once. Come to think of it, Extinction was a good title and should have been left extinct.
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|This is an outstanding account of how a nation of 7 million people became one of the world's leading high technology industry hubs. If you love Israel, or you just want to understand the Middle East better, this book is a must read.  If you're interested in business and economy and what it takes to create the environment for this kind of incredible productivity to become reality,  you must read this book.
B0064BCNA4|5.0|Not often do you find an app for music for a 3 and 4 year old that you can actually stand. I enjoy listening to them in the options in changing the the piano to organ does saxophones sounds, therefore they have a variety stop send from getting bored
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been waiting for SOO LONG! I am glad that this came out, though it is a little too pricy.....
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was intrigued by this book, it kept my attention and I couldn't put it down!!! Can't wait to move to the next one!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It was great watching the entire Harry Potter collection over the course of a week vs. years.  Exceptional entertainment for any age.

B00932A5QA|3.0|This movie is a continuation of the Startship Troopers franchise and follows in the movie series (not the cartoon series) story arc.  The movie is 3D animated with human voices and music.  The plot is good, the animation is good (the characters emote and move properly (no &#34;wooden&#34; faces, no &#34;clunky&#34; movements), but I had great touble hearing the dialogue.  I believe that on the DVD or Bl-Ray, the audio is 5.1, but in the stream the audio was presented in &#34;PCM 48 (kbits/sec)&#34; stereo.  Unfortunately the dialogue &#34;channel&#34;, which in 5.1 is on the center speaker, was missing, with only residual dialogue available on the front L & R channels.  Amazon needs to either have the stream &#34;remastered&#34; (either Amazon remasters the audio or has Sony (who owns the movie and the franchise) remaster the audio) for stereo presentation or present the stream with a 5.1 audio which would be better because the rest of the audio (music and effects) was very good.<br /><br />Technical Details:  Streaming video was played on a Sony BDP-BX58 streaming/Blu-Ray player (registered with Amazon Instant Video to my ID/account).  Video was HDMI-out to a Sony HD TV. Audio was TOS-optically connected to a Sony STR-K670P DTS (5.1) audio system.
1451613512|1.0|Oliver Stone has always been a bit looney, but this book is from the mind of a lunatic.  While most of the facts are accurate, the conclusions are truly bizarre. Akin to concluding 2+3= 8 million.<br /><br />The most stunning thing is that Show Time is showing a so called documentary of this book. Any lunatic can write a book or make a movie, but why in the world would a commercial venture give them the time of day?<br /><br />Only read this book for a look inside the mind of a crazy person. If your interest is history, read factual accounts of the time and form your own conclusions. Most anyone is smarter than Oliver Stone.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|One of two reference discs we use from this year's releases for ISF HDTV evaluations - the other was &#34;Art of Flight&#34;
B002CN2NCG|4.0|The 'Region Free' made me suspicious.  This seems to be a UK import, but it worked just fine for me.  The resolution is not up to Blu-ray standards and is not noticeably improved over DVD.  They clearly did not work hard on this transfer, which is a shame.  However, the print quality is far and away better than my 1999 DVD.  That was transferred from a used print and was full of scratches and spots.  This edition appears to have been transferred from a clean print.  I would love to see some of the new technology applied to clean up the grain.  The film is quite grainy.  It is my favorite movie ever, so I'm glad to have the improvements there are.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is a format in which you create a bulliten board for yourself from the Internet, post to your board and thus others can see your pin.  A great way to share all sorts of great info.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|The Movie was very visually stunning.  I liked the characters and was captivated the whole time.  I recommend this title for people of all ages.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved the book enough to make it my 1st e-book purchase to keep in my library. If you love dogs, this is the one.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|When I think of Abraham Lincoln I think &#34;old school&#34; and boring but this was far from it.  Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was action packed and full of suspense.  It was something new in an over saturated action market and that is a difficult achievement.  I recommend this movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian, very realistic  shows what is possible using technology and common sense to survive in a hostile enviorment. Great
B002KYGLVQ|5.0|It's fun having movies that you want to watch once a year on the same day.  This has become one of those classics.
0446580848|4.0|No one writes dialogue as effectively as Nelson DeMille. His characters (especially John Corey) literally jump off the page, spreading humor and mayhem wherever they alight. I must confess to reading and loving all DeMille's books with few exceptions. (the Gold Coast being one of them). Any outing that features the snarky, opinionated John Corey is one I can't miss.<br /><br />There is much to love about the PANTHER, although it suffers in comparison to THE LION & the LION's GAME. Why is that? I felt that the final few chapters of this novel were a letdown after a steady, satisfying buildup of tension and suspense. I almost got the sense that DeMille grew bored with it and cobbled together a less than satisfying ending.<br />Also, one quibble I have with DeMille (& Robert Parker on occasion) concerns gratuitously including characters from other series when there is little reason to do so. (In this case it is Paul from The GENERAL\\"S DAUGHTER, another DeMille masterpiece that I loved.) I consider it lazy writing as if the author resurrected familiar faces rather than going to the effort of crafting new ones.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, I recommend THE PANTHER for its many strengths, and for the undiluted pleasure of observing a master writer at work. More John Corey, please!
B009NZQDW2|5.0|I have watched this movie many times but it still captures me with something new each time I view it.  I love the playful yet gritty nature of it, the colorful characters and the masterful blend of action and romance.  If you haven't see this movie watch it now!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Season 2 is different from the first season -- but it was still terrific. Jessica Lange is amazing! I predict another Emmy for her.
0679805273|5.0|I am looking forward to getting all of my daughter's teachers to write in her book as she grows.  She has Down's Syndrome and I think it will be a good reminder of how far she has come over the years.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I like this app on a tablet, but not so much on my phone.  The website comes up with just one item per screen which is better for the phone than the app that shows two.
B009715NUK|5.0|Always love to buy PSB,s cd singles because they always add brilliant bonus tracks. These bonus tracks would have fit well into Elysium the album.<br />Definitely worth buying as is the Emil cd.<br />Now looking forward to their new d singles for their latest release.<br />Merry Chriistmas and Happy New Year.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It is such a Brilliant book that I Could not put it down. I  fininished it in two days during Chrismas.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|...I thought I was purchasing a complete game! When I completed the first level on the last world on \\"Path of the Jedi\\" I either had to 3-star on every previous course (ya...right) or purchase the last level to continue. Will I buy it? Yes. Do I like it? No. I don't like the manipulation tactic. But I do love the game...so I'll suck it up.
0525478817|5.0|Good read. large print. The story is excellent should be read regardless of age. Hard cover great for sharing with others as I have handed it off. Shipped fast and orderly with out damage.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Bought this for my mother for Christmas present. I want one for my self! We have tablets that are cheap off brands, the kindle is so clear and easy to scroll through.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|Love Cloud Atlas and love the soundtrack! Haven't seen a movie that really touches you on many levels like this one in a long while, if ever. I think this movie and soundtrack are in its own category.

0345803493|5.0|Good Book. Held my interest from start to finish. The characters are real.  At first I thought this would be just another &#34;romance type novel&#34;.  It had a little bit of everything.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower is one of the most genuinely heart felt and down to earth books I have ever read. This book has a characters who are relatable for almost every type of person. The main character, Charlie is one of the sweetest kids I have ever had the pleasure to read about. He truly is the ultimate wallflower. His friends Sam and Patrick exemplify this characteristic as well. It left me with goose bumps, wanting nothing more than a sequel.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is the greatest!! I loved this book.  I am now reading &#34;The Rescue&#34;.  What a great author! You must read his books.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Perfectly cast, but could have used a little finer touch on editing. Eight more words are required before I submit this review.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far... this is a pretty neat little app. Even the kids like it. Looking to unlock even more of what this app has to offer in the near future. I love that you earn points by playing and you don't have to pay anything to continue on to new games.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love Facebook on my Kindle Fire but I love the game Candy Crush Saga and I cannot get the game when I am using Facebook on my new Kindle Fire.
B009O2XY12|4.0|All of us in the family like to play this bubble burst game, all ages.  The grandkids really love to play it and so do I.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|What a good read, very heart felt and emotional. With just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you guessing. Highly suggested!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting, the scenery, the costumes and mostly the story lines....so many people with intriguing stories. Downtown Abbey begins its new season soon---I cannot wait.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There aren't enough adjectives to describe one of the most amazing books I have ever read (which are many).  Hopeless is beyond fabulous.  I cannot really explain the beauty of this book.  The author is amazingly talented. Five stars just don't seem enough for this absolutely wonderful creation.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|The movie was very touching.  It was a very unique coming of age movie.  I liked it very much.  Very enjoyable.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Omg I loved this book!!! I loved it so much I finished it in one day!!! U can't pay attention to the pages when he so into it!!! :)
B0061S073A|5.0|Downloaded this on kindle fire hd for my five year old and it is great. Easy to use and keeps him where he needs to be.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great to have all three movies together, boxed set, great value, recommend highly!!! Great gift for yourself or someone else, awesome action movies.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Wheat Belly is an eye opener for those of us striving to understand why we are gaining weight when trying to lose and or maintain our weight.  I suspected that prepared foods were to blame but did not realize that it was also modified ingredients that we have taken for granted over the years.  Between the FDA, USDA and agribusiness, we are lucky to be alive.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Everyone uses Facebook, so to be able to have it on my Kindle HD Fire is amazing. I'm so thankful that this app was available.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I watched the series already. Bought it for my folks for Christmas. I highly recommend it to anyone. By the way, for all the people saying Claire Danes doesnt look good in this series I completely disagree...she is hot!<br /><br />Arrived Quickly. Great Product.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love this game. It has different levels of difficulty and therefore it is always a challenge. Great free app.
B001EYU1VO|4.0|A very nice Flight stick , does what it is suppose to do and that make's it a great deal for the price
B008XG1X18|4.0|I'm not sure how to upload my files to Pinterest yet. This app is a bit difficult to navigate at this point because I've just not spent that much time on it. I am sure once I figure it out, it will be pretty easy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read this book about twenty times and I'll probably read it twenty more. I absolutely love it and will never get bored with the hunger games.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This was best thing that my husband set up for me on the Kindle HD Fire.<br />How cool, I can check my email on the go. Love it and easy to use.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie first and thoroughly enjoyed it so thought I'd take the opportunity to compare the two. All in all.I was not disappointed with the comparison. I felt the movie did justice to the book which was of course outstanding.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I wasn't too fond of this book. It seemed pretty predictable and I felt the author wrapped it up in a tidy little bow.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Someone lost this movie for my mom so I thought it would be a great gift, she loved it. Great price and quick delivery
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Syncs across all devices, and works with the Kindle default browser (Silk?). Costs only $1 a month for premium. Well worth it as it makes my online life much easier to manage.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is good, personally I think it's better than temple run. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it has a couple glitches when I play it on my kindle fire.<br />1. It freezes up occasionally when I enter also freezes when I play it.<br />2. Sometimes when I try to go to the store it says something about the game not working, so I can't buy anything.<br />Other that that it's a pretty good game :)
B00APUYWYA|4.0|A little childish at times (to this 30+ woman) but otherwise cute, funny, and very enjoyable. I'd watch it again.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Bought for my son as a gift. He has watched it several times and shared it with his friends and uncle
B009NQKPUW|3.0|We expected more from this movie. The previews make the movie look interesting, and it was, but it still left something to be desired. The biggest disappointment was the ending...kinda stupid.
0446619078|5.0|My mother was wanting to check out this author. She enjoyed the book so much she bought one for my sister.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|The storyline for this movie was okay. The acting was still as bad as or worse than the first part. Action was also not as good. This one I'd wait until HBO for.
B009329Y30|4.0|If you're looking for a standard chick flick with a dose of eye candy, this movie is for you.  Zac Efron is extremely easy on the eyes, even if you can predict how the film will end.  I'd watch it again, which is saying something.
B0086700CM|2.0|I was going through the tutorial I could do jump and duck but when it came time for collecting coins it didn't work. I tiled my device and nothing happening I was confused. I went into options and turned off the tutorial. But nothing worked. So I just deleted the app.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Fast read, hints of fifty shades of gray in the story line but still intriguing. Would read more of her stuff.
B009B8YZIK|3.0|I REALLY enjoyed watching this movie online, and was excited for the DvD because of the extra footage. With the exception of a brief introduction to the cadets at the start of the movie, there was nothing on the DVD that was not on the web episodes. Granted, it was only $12, and it is nice to watch the film without the break between switching web episodes, but I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you plan to watch the movie many times.
B000IHSKSY|5.0|This is a Great Shoe. use them  for hiking, great water shoe. also wear them as casual ware. Will buy another pair if they ever wear out.
B000021Y77|5.0|I had searched for this particular version of tgw movie fir years. The movie had a price tag of $19.95. I received it  for about $7 including shipping. It arrived four days earlier than I thought. Sealed in package. Plays perfect. I was a first time buyer for Amazon and skeptical. I couldn't be happier!
B0013KTGAG|3.0|This movie was strange.  There were parts that were really beautiful.  It was well acted and I enjoyed the characters.  The first three-quarters of the movie were interesting, psychological, quiet.  Of course, you expect that something is going to go terribly wrong at some point, but I really didn't expect it to turn into a horror movie at the end.  It just didn't make sense to me.  If you're a sci-fi fan and not a horror fan, then the end will not please you.  Personally, I think it would've been a five-star movie without the strange twist.  I would have preferred not to watch a crazy guy running around trying to kill everyone while his skin peeled off, shot in a headache-inducing, blurry, shaky-cam style.  We could've gotten to the same ending in the movie without that, since plenty had already started to go wrong before the crazy man was introduced.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Known as probably the longest novel written and I can see why. With all the hype over the stage show and imminant release of the film I thought I should read it. This is the second time I have attemped to read this novel. Found it alot easier to read on my kindle than book form. Really enjoyed the story line with Jean Valjean ,Fantine and Cosette but found his side issues like Waterloo and closed religeous orders rather tedious and spoilt it for me. But this could just be that i,m too thick to appreciate classic literature.
B00AAQ7JNA|4.0|Nothing to complain about here. Good show, Rihiana shows growth in every area since her last Good Girl Gone Bad Blu-Ray. Those who complained about bad sound need to check/upgrade their systems. Dolby Digital sound was clear and powerful. Several sexy costume changes and good pacing throughout. She is indeed talented and not just a MTV Video Vixen. Would have liked some video extras and a booklet. All you get is the concert with a few offstage looks at her tour. But it was a very good tour, staging effects musicians singers and dancers are all first rate. Reccomended.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I like how it shares time alarm weathering and you chose what and how to put your alarm in the time you chose very well alarm clock system. I give it 3 stars. :)
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I am not a horror film fan.<br />But I was hooked after seeing the origial Alien in the movies.<br />Watched then all again in Blue Ray. It is the best way too see<br />them. Most action scenes are in low light. Blue Ray adds the deffinition you need.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This app is great and fun I like it because it is easy to collect money and the pets are SO cute!!!!!!!!!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I saw this in 3D in the theater after all the ESPN hype advertisements.<br />The scenes look great in 3D. I have a 47&#34; LG 3D set. Great depth.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book is now my favorite book! It was muy bien as Alex would say haha this book was so amazing I started it last night read until 5 this morning not realizing I had fallen asleep and when I woke up this morning I read all day until I finished it I never reread books but this is one that I will definitely be visiting very soon into the near future.... after I finish the others
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I enjoy all of the Reacher novels and especially enjoy how he thinks and we are privy to it :)<br />thanks and keep up the good work! &#60;&#62;&#60;
B009JBZH54|5.0|Recommend to all Batman followers.  Quality is excellent in Blue-Ray The product came right on time.  Very happy and the price was right.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest and downloaded this app onto my Kindle Fire. So far its been working just fine for me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Deceptively simple. Fun. Addictive! You need to download this game on every device.  Deceptively simple. Fun. Addictive!  You need to download this
B003MC5N28|5.0|I got caught up in the story immediately.  The book is geared toward younger readers but it is a story for everyone.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|read this for bookclub on a recommendation from one of our members.  everyone loved it.  you'll think twice about flower selection from now on!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Another hit by Guy Richie! Hopefully another one for the return of Holmes is in the works, as you know Sir Arthur Conan Dyle was forced to resurect Holmes due to the clamour raised by Victorian fans.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Disney does it again - the formula of loss and realization works between mother and daughter. The small gags along the way are truly what makes this stand apart from so many other animated features.
B0092QITO2|5.0|The best DVD of the film! Every thing you wanted to know! How stunts were done, set design, behind the scenes, to say I loved it is putting it mildly!
1118156307|5.0|If you have ever wanted to understand creative thinking and problem solving - this is a good text book. Insightful, useful, and engaging the entire way through.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|This is great rendition of the musical as it is a little more raw than the typical soundtracks.  Anne Hathaway is great.  I wish though that all songs were included on it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I highly recommend watching Homeland.  Great show, phenomenal actors, intense plot, great direction.  Definitely my newest addiction.  I'm completely hooked!
0547884591|5.0|it is one of the best books i have ever read. every line is pure gold and i have given it to all my relatives to read.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie was really good. During movies I usually cannot wait until they are over, but I didn't have that feeling during Pitch Perfect. The movie was funny and the actors and actresses were good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Incredible story, definite page-turner; love, adventure, ferocity...but still an easy read. Could not put it down!  Cannot wait to get into the next 2 books
1451695195|5.0|A brilliant neurosurgeon who understands the body sees the part of man that cannot be disected.  His spiritual soul, his consiousness which makes man different from animals.  This books makes sense out of the question of wheather there is an afterlife. It is an uplifting book.  I bought 10 copies to share with friends and family.  This brought me back to basic religious teaching that man does have a soul, a theory that has lately been denigrated.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved Eye of the Needle and other mystery/spy stories by Follett. Bought Pillar of the Earth without checking any reviews just because I like his writing so much and was taken aback when it open in the 15th century, ugh, a historical novel. I was hooked and have read all of his subsequent novels including my second Paperwhite read, Fall of Giants.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not too sappy not too dull. Very clear cut. And beautifully written. To say it's a page turner is an understatement.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It was a little slow getting started, but really ended up being a cute movie.  I watched it twice.  Liked it better the second time.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this is a really great games finally a good game maker out there I wasn't sure about playing it at first I'm happy I got it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I would say very fun but had miner vltiched and some times will freeze up.you get addicted very quickly but after awhile (a month)  you'll probly not love it as much
B000002G7G|3.0|There are only two recordings on this album that I like.  I just keep forwarding until I can hear the two I like.  That's why I bought it, for the two recordings only.
B001N4RORE|4.0|Yea, Its not the best singing throughout, but its cute, endearing, and fun to watch! My Daughter & I Just Love it! The song &#34;Slipping Through My Fingers&#34; makes me cry every time I see it! Besides, if you love ABBA you'll love this!
145210655X|5.0|It is just too cute.  I have it on my coffee table and pretty much everyone flips through it and laughs.  Now that's a good coffee table book!
0312323867|5.0|Something Borrowed is one of my most favorite books of all time, even though I DO NOT agree with cheating or stealing someone else's other half AT ALL. but in the book most people come to despise the greedy, conceited, selfish Darcy, and at the end, though two wrongs dont make a right, you hate her even more when you find out what she was doing behind her Fiance's back. So when I saw this sequel I thought &#34;there is NO way I am reading a book that is JUST about Darcy&#34; but then I read the reviews and I was intrigued so I bought it and I could NOT put it down. We see her find herself in ways that I dont think anyone could have imagined and we watch a miraculous transformation of a selfish socialite into a loving and caring mother. Something Blue exceeded my expectations and even became, In My opinion just as good, if not better, Than Something Borrowed. I HIGHLY recommend this book. you will not be sorry
B000FCKBCU|5.0|Bought this on the advice of my sister, who was reading it at the time.  So glad I did!  A funny, well-crafted story that draws you into the action and makes you wonder what you would have chosen if you were faced with the same decision.
B000AGTPUU|4.0|My 10 year old daughter liked it. After seeing this my daughter wanted a bell from Santa's reindeer too so we got this movie and a reindeer bell as a gift for her for Christmas.  Great family movie especially for Christmas.
B008N1LL42|3.0|This movie was just okay. I was hoping for more. Most of the good story points were in the last 15 minutes.
0060987464|5.0|This book is really good. From him going to the basement in his grandparents house, to him going through high school. Meeting the band members, getting screwed over. I feel like he really opened up and didn't hid anything. I recommend it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Fun movie to watch with your tween or teen. The signing is amazing and Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy steals the show.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Fantastic. Just recently got into the walking dead comics after midseason 3 break on AMC. Keep up the good work guys. Love the show and loving the comic.
B007PVHBHC|2.0|I thought the album was overly long, the songs not very catchy.  Although I admire Patti's great creativity, this one just didn't do it for me.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I was not happy with this ap. It is difficult to navigate, with the exception of the messages. I deleted it...for now. Maybe go back to it at a later time.
B00785P2QC|4.0|needs to eliminate the stupid purchasing requirements to access parts of the game. otherwise very fun, less micromanagement than games like Sim city which is nice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Well, it has been a long time since I've played this game, and once I figured out that all I had to do was touch the card and it would go into place, I was moving along quickly.
B0001VV1GK|4.0|My son loves everything cars, so this was right up his alley. He really loves it, yet another place to put all of his cars. My only complaint ( and it's a very small one) is that the lower level is hard to get at and the ramps are not fixed. This is a well constructed, easy to put together, very portable toy that doesn't take up tons of space in your house.

B008EZVNO0|5.0|Pagan Heart made it worth it. Only one track I didn't care for. Well done! It was a instant favorite album.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|played this game for years on my computer have always like the game very challenging was you start its hard to quit
B005LAII8K|1.0|This movie was not even good. Probably going to use this disc to scrape snow off the car tomorrow.<br />Sincerely,<br />Disappointed
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow.  What a twisting and turning plot. Couldn't put this story down, knowing something  unpredictable and crazy would happen next.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I'd seen this movie before but wanted to buy it for my collection.  I'm glad I did!  It's a keeper.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch never dies -- but he gets older as Michael Connelly's superb series of Los Angeles police procedurals continues growing longer. In The Black Box, the 18th of the Harry Bosch novels and the 33rd of Connelly's books, Bosch's mind is undimmed but his body is showing signs of age as he digs deeply into a 20-year-old mystery that haunted him as a cop on the beat.<br /><br />Now a seasoned detective in the LAPD's Open Unsolved Unit, Harry jumps at the chance to take a crack at the unsolved murder of Anneke Jesperson, a Danish war correspondent who mysteriously died of a gunshot during the Rodney King riots in South Central L.A. Harry and his partner had been called to the scene of her murder 20 years earlier but because there were so many victims they were forced to move on to yet another murder scene as soon as they'd called the coroner. However, once Harry has begun to dig his teeth into the scant evidence available, his boss in the Open Unsolved Unit begins an intense effort to force him off the case. As in so many of Harry's cases, police politics has intervened, and he finds himself forced to battle the LAPD all the while he pursues the growing signs of a conspiracy in Jesperson's murder and the involvement of war crimes in the case.<br /><br />In most of the Harry Bosch stories, events unfold exclusively within Los Angeles. However, the Jesperson case takes Harry far afield into California's Central Valley, where he is forced to confront the grim presence of a small town's power elite. There, the story takes a turn reminiscent of the late Ross McDonald's 18 Lew Archer novels, which I devoured when much younger.<br /><br />As always, Harry's dogged persistence wins the day, and Connelly's spare but smoothly flowing writing is fully satisfying.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|He's happy with it!  He enjoyed this brand new movie a lot..  What more can I say other than that?
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Love the game, it's fun and cute. Recently got a Galaxy Note 2, and the game dies on first board first game; starts playing music, but no graphics UI elements to be seen. Looking forward to a fix hitting the app store.

0316228532|5.0|One of the main things separating J. K. Rowling from many authors of Literary Fiction is that she doesn't pretend to pull her punches. You pretty much know at the outset what she does and doesn't like, and yet, like any of the best writers of social satire (T. C. Boyle comes to mind) she can show us how much she dislikes someone without demonizing them -- while at the same time avoiding the sanctification of heroes.<br /><br />It's a powerful book, and not for the faint of heart, including frank and thankfully non-prurient depictions of teen sexuality, drug abuse, teen and adult mental illness, and rape.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|purchases item as xmas gift. very quick and easy. brand new dvd purchases. came in mail in good shape. very happy with item
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|After seeing this, my husband remarked, \\"So...'Les Miserables' refers to EVERYBODY.\\"<br /><br />I have doubts about the wisdom of adapting successful musicals to the big screen.  IMO, the artificiality of the musical form is better suited to the artificiality of the stage.  There are exceptions, of course.  Les Miserables is one, though I must confess there were a couple of times I found myself wishing for a non-musical version with the same cast. The sheer intensity of the acting carries this movie.  Hugh Jackman's Jean Valjean and Anne Hathaway's Fantine are simply stunning.  The steely integrity of Russell Crowe's underplayed Javert rings true as he pursues Jean Valjean to uphold the letter of the law. Lesser acting would have made this movie cringe-worthy. As it is, it's a must-see.  Tissues required.  It's been a long time since I've seen a finale as rousing and awesome as this.<br /><br />Others can debate the various merits of voices, range, musicality and production values. I'd say see this. It's one of the world's greatest stories.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|If you have a quirky sense of humor, this is a must see!  If you don't like Family Guy, don't bother.
B007V65R54|4.0|This is a good discussion of the problems of prediction in real-world settings and the obstacles encountered in modeling/predicting events.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fast read. Just like The Hunger Games, couldn't put it down until I was done. Great book to get lost in.
1594487154|5.0|This book is definitely not just about traditional sales, Dan Pink describes selling as moving people to take action, and therefore this book can be applied to any situation: teachers getting kids to listen to their stories, parents to get kids listen to them, or people getting their friends to take action.<br /><br />You can't talk about sales without discussing sales at auto dealerships, and the first few chapters of his book describe great in-depth stories on how old-school sales at auto dealerships happened in the pre-internet era, and what makes dealerships successful in sales today. I work for auto dealerships and this helps clarify the situation of what is happening to auto dealerships today (going out of business or not).<br /><br />Many people have the skills to be good at sales, there are a few exercises in the book to test this. But the best part of the book is really the last few chapters that give a clear how-to on how to sell. Advice that is practical and gives direction to how to sell better, and at the same time it's not too complicated to execute. It is based on skills that all people can obtain, as everybody is in sales.<br /><br />We know the elevator pitch, in the book, Dan Pink offers a pitch makeover, and shares 6 different formats on how to pitch and a clear direction on how to create pitches that sell.<br /><br />One of the pitch formulas (the Pixar Pitch) shown in the book To Sell is Human for the book itself:<br /><br />\\"Once upon a time only some people were in sales. Every day, they sold stuff, we did stuff, and everyone was happy. One day, everything changed: All of us ended up in sales - and sales changed from a world of caveat emptor to caveat venditor. Because of that, we had to learn the new ABC's - attunement, buoyancy, and clarity. Because of that, we had to learn some new skills - to pitch, to improvise and to serve. Until finally we realized that selling isn't some grim accommodation to a merciless world of commerce. It's part of who we are - and therefore something we can do better by being more human.\\" - To Sell is Human<br /><br />The most valuable trait that I learned from the book and will transform my business is that its not just about serving my client; it's about creating a better world, it's about making a difference in the world of my client.<br /><br />This essence transforms selling from something I have to do, in something that I want to do. This is a book that can transform how you see sales and shift your perspective in selling from a necessary evil, in something that can make the world a better place. If a book is capable of moving a person like that, isn't that worth it?who we are - and therefore something we can do better by being more human.\\" - To Sell is Human<br /><br />The most valuable trait that I learned from the book and will transform my business is that its not just about serving my client; it's about creating a better world, it's about making a difference in the world of my client.<br /><br />This essence transforms selling from something I have to do, in something that I want to do.

B0018CWESK|5.0|I love this movie; always waiting for it to appear on Tv. Hey Now I can watch it whenever I want. Great buy-- Happy New Year
0525478817|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the characters in it. It will make you laugh and cry. There are some lines that I wish I could remember forever . A book worth reading. It's a fast easy read as well.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Plays smooth with the right amount of hints. Hard enough to make it challenging but still very playable.<br />Great storyline to make it interesting.
B00007GZR5|2.0|This movie had some beautiful parts - mainly the art theme and beautiful coloring. But for me it wasn't believable mainly because of a lack of character development. The love story between Chris and Anna didn't draw me in. There just wasn't any chemistry between them in the beginning, and their love affair (i.e. their becoming \\"soul mates\\") happened too fast for me to feel like I witnessed or felt it happen. Then came their two kids who we were watching the funeral for just a few minutes after first meeting them. Again, very little character development. The deaths of the children should have caused me to feel the hurt and loss that Chris and Anna would feel as their parents. But, instead, it was very fairly unemotional for me because there was no chance for me to connect with them as characters. This movie could have been done so much better. It seems rushed and, well, carelessly put together. It is hard to follow and even borders on ridiculous at points.<br /><br />The actors did a good job with what they were given to work with. Robin Williams, being the funny guy that he is, can sometimes be hard to believe in a romantic role. But, I've seen a couple of other movies of his where he was able to pull it off so I don't lay the blame on him. Annabella Sciorra's acting was fine as was Cuba Gooding Jr's (whose presence helped carry this movie along, in my opinion - - that is, until it was revealed who his character really was).<br /><br />Having the children become other people in \\"heaven\\" just increased the distance I already felt from their characters. Finally, the end of the movie with the family reuniting in \\"heaven\\" brought the chaotic storyline to a close and I was able to smile because they were at least all together and it was over. All I can say is that I'm glad I didn't pay movie theatre prices to see this.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|With the exception of the usual, you can have nicer things sooner (at a price) situation. This game is very good game. doubley so, for being free.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is great for all ages.  We pull it out every Christmas and watch it with the whole family.  Everyone enjoys the great humor
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Great bio from a great guitar virtuoso.  Mr. Townshend analyzes his past life and sheds light on just &#34;Who He Is&#34;.
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|Very well compiled album with each song, except the last two, 5 stars. Great rythym mixed with great percussion makes this a fantastic album. I can't stop listening to it.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|Daniel Craig brings a solemnity and sadness to James Bond that makes him more like a government approved Jason Bourne than the caddish, suave ladies man we've all come to love. Gone is the humor and charisma. Now it's just another assassin. Disappointing. I like Daniel Craig, but this new incarnation of James Bond is just no fun at all.
B000UX6OHK|4.0|My wife loved the design of this watch so much that when the face fell apart after a couple years, she went searching to buy another one. Not a logical buy, but shows how nice the watch looks.
1419707663|5.0|I bought these books for my grandson and he loves to read them.  These book are good for children if they love to read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the Walking Dead! Season three is the best so far! If you love horror flicks you'll love this!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fairly easy.  The timed part makes it much more difficult or fun.  Good game for kids and working on spatial relations.
B007HACDLK|4.0|One of if not the best in the series.  Would recommend it to those who have read other Flynn books, or those who have not.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie is a Christmas tradition and so a must to have.  This video was shipped fast and well packaged!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this CD!  I am also using this CD to teach my Pilates class.  I can't wait till another new release.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Arrow controls run into menu button on kindle fire hd. Your controls over sensitive and you just end up flying back and forth across track. Slightest movement makes car move way too much
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I love this book.  Such a great story. Hope I get to read it again someday maybe in the next few months.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The graphics are adorable - I am really enjoying the game.  Not much of a game player normally - usually spider solitaire or backgammon are the only games I play.  Didn't get Angry Birds or some of the other games.  My kids told me about this one and they both really enjoyed it (they are in their 20's) so gave it a try.  Really fun and interesting.  Good job on this.
1455160474|5.0|This is an extremely well written book. The emotions and details were emotionally charged. I admire the writer for his attention to truth and pushing ahead with gentle diligence to get this story out. Very well written. I have been motivated to do what I can for the North Korean People.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy it. The game offers a break when bored. I wish that it had a few more options while playing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Get now if you don't shame on you!<br />Hope you like surfing! Much MUCH better than Temple Run!Get now right now!!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I am a huge Jane Austin fan but felt even so this movie was done remarkably well and Keira Knightly gave a brilliant performance.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its the best game ever it does not need Wifi so its great tor the road you need to get it!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first, but the book is better, in my opinion. If you're looking for a good read, I definitely suggest this one.
B00AE2I4B6|2.0|I like the Step Up series of movies. This was my least favorite one of them. The reason this movie did not get a one star was because the last half of the movie was actually really good. I'm not trolling, the actresses and actors were great dancers, but their acting was not very good at all. The first part of the movie was kinda bland, but the end definitely saved it. I loved the end of the movie. Some cool moves, and great story to end it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You like fast?  This is great. I like the colors and I found it fun. Test your skills and see if you can keep it going before the time runs out.
B00AE2LJVS|1.0|I got this movie for Shia LaBeouf. It reminded me of a &#34;No Country for Old Men&#34; kind of movie. It didn't really have a direction. It was just a movie about some law breaking moonshiners. I was not really impressed. It did have some cool parts and a few good fights. Very gory and pretty graphic. Would not watch it again.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I don't understand why so many reviews on here are bad because they can't connect the dots between this movie and the other alien movies. It all was very clear to me and made perfect sense. It was a nice prequel.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|....But its definitely not my favorite. The music is pretty good. I like the story that is in the movie. I felt though that the movie tried to hard to be funny. Its jokes weren't really funny as much as just plain vulgar sometimes. I did not expect it to have a sort of &#34;scary movie&#34; kinda feel, but sometimes it did.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|It is fun to play but hard to know what keys you are really suposed to play.<br />I am not a piano player so that makes it even more challenging for me.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you want to learn about the early part of the 20th century and relive history this is the book.  The events of this period in the US, Europe, and Russia come alive with charactors that are almost real.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|this album has not all, but many of the group's finest hits.. great introduction to their style of lyrics and blend of tones and sounds all mixed up to create great music
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Your typical waking up in Vegas story with a slight twist.  The characters' motives for getting married are unique but thats about it.  Characters aren't as developed as I would have liked and the plot line is a bit jumpy but it was a decent read.  Would recommend if you are looking for a good read that won't take long and doesn't beat around the bush.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is so cool I luv it so much!I bought it on my ipad and fell in luv with it!!!!!!!!!
0525478817|5.0|Anyone who is even glancing at this book should read it!  It was so heart-felt and well-written!  I pass it on to everyone!  John Green wrote a fantastic book, I absolutely love it!
0547884591|5.0|Even though the book is full of information (maybe too much), the one most important thing I learned is:<br /><br />You can learn anything you want much much faster then you ever thought possible!<br /><br />This is enough! Buy this, read this, apply this and enjoy yourself!
B0030IM458|5.0|Even better the second time!! I think I watched the whole set in a day... I've already gotten my daughter hooked, and it was made 2 years before her birth!  Please don't remake it, I beg of you...
B0035WTE2U|5.0|los felicitos<br /><br />me llego<br /><br />en poco tiempo<br /><br />los felicitos<br /><br />amigo<br /><br />jose coronado<br /><br />desde<br /><br />venezuela<br /><br />mas fino<br /><br />ok ...<br />.<br />.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just what I was looking for!  Perfect for anyone in need of larger numbers and ease.  FREE IS ALWAYS WONDERFUL ALSO!
0061703087|5.0|Chrichton is best known for Jurasic Park, but this is the very best of his books. The book focuses on an interesting technology -- nano-tech or tiny little robots...really tiny...like a thosand could sit on this period ( . ) and the characters are much better than usual for Chrichton. After getting this book from the library and reading it, I bought a copy for both my dad and husband for christmas. This is a must read!
1451696191|5.0|I loved this book so much, it's one of the greatest books I've ever read! Stephen Chbosky is a genius. Simply amazing!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Continues to be really gross and really awesome, as well as more than a little grim. Rarely does a post-apocolypitic show really deliver on the horror of daily life once civilization has fallen, but the Walking Dead does so in spades!
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is the story of how a biglaw lawyer (large firm, six figures) cracks under the pressure of working grueling hours, doing boring work. Really, this might be every attorney's dream, to leave the big show and work in the trenches, but that's something else entirely. This young attorney meets up with two \\"ambulance chasers\\" and starts working with them just as they begin a major lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company. The case is a loser, and David (the lawyer) is quickly learning about a side of the practice of law that he never knew existed.<br /><br />Just like any Grisham novel, there is some exaggeration as to what happens in real life, but not much. If you like procedural lawyer thrillers, this might not be for you. It's not the firm, it's not a time to kill, but it's not meant to be.<br /><br />This is one of the only Grisham books i have ever laughed during. The book is funny, although I'll admit, some of the jokes are perceptible to those who practice law.<br /><br />I found the characters to be a little shallow. Not much is learned about why people do what they do, aside from the main character. I wouldn't say they are overly simplistic, but it's a short book and not a great deal of character development takes place. That being said, it's a short book that you can read in a few days. It's a funny look into personal injury and street law. It's entertaining and you find yourself liking the young attorney more and more...<br /><br />If you can get it on the cheap, I recommend it. But don't take it as indicative of other Grisham books.. However, I think a few more like this might do well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best written books I've ever read.  It has everything ...  love, drama, encouragement, and it's inspiring...  just to name a few.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|The Phantom has always been one of my favorite live performances and recently this movie has been added to my list of favorites.  The only thing better would be for the show to tour here in the US.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|PERFECT video player is all i have to say! Thank you so much for this APP its totally awesome! I can save my own videos to my kindle! Yay! Exactly what i was looking for!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I liked it. I would get it if I didn't had little kids. Its a good dudes movie to enjoy with friends that share the same sense of humor.
B00002N9ER|5.0|i used these mounts for my 3 cell led mag. they grip the flashlight perfectly. seem to be made of a good quality abs plastic. mounted it to the a pillar in my wj and it hasn't budged. its great having the thing handy.
B0095VOK8I|2.0|I love Homeland! however around the middle of the season on this dvd set, there were scratches: irregular picture and audio. Luckily I had caught the end of the first season at the beginning of the 2nd season so I did not feel compelled to sit through the agony.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I LOVE this show!  Each character has their own distinctive personality, but together they create a deliciously blended whole.  I adore each and every one of them but for different reasons.  The relationships between the characters are continuously fresh and entertaining.  The back stories are great.  There is just the right mix of humor and pathos.  Also love the casting of guest stars.  Sometimes I can't follow the stories, but it doesn't matter because the delivery is so awesome.
B005D0RDKC|4.0|Before I start............one major blunder on these cds.  Why are many of the recordings not in mono but stereo?!?  Makes no sense.  You have JC booming in the right speaker and the back beat on the left......weird.<br /><br />Anyways......this is a very good historical record of Johnny Cash throughout the years from Texas Jamborees in 1956 to playing for servicemen in Vietnam to playing for President Nixon.  What you really get to understand about Cash listening through these recordings that besides a dip towards the dark side in his drug days, he comes off as a very human, non manufactured and real.  There is a passion in his music from when he first took to the stage until his last performance at the House of Cash (check youtube).  He shows a deep respect for Nixon which should be noted to all due to the lack of respect shown but Bush and Obama.<br /><br />If Cash came along today, I really don't think he would make it...........he would have a following but it would be in a cult status.  His love of Jesus and his belief that pours out of his soul would be laughed at today by the Pitchfork bloggers of the world.<br /><br />Long Live Cash!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't stop reading it. I'm constantly in my book reading. Who should she love? Will they survive? So many questions. Such a great book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book.<br />  I wanted to read this book because I wanted to read the book to see what all the fuss was about.  I read the book non stop definitely the book is much better than the movie because it's more detailed.<br />  It doesn't mean I won't be watching the movie again I will it's entertaining but the book definitely is much better.
034580404X|5.0|The wife loved it and so did I. I wish there were a few more books to keep this going.
B000002L7Y|5.0|Its A-ha. Of course its great!!! Really amazing album which I recommend any 80's lover to own and enjoy! A true masterpiece and milestone in music!!!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Minor issues but, the company seent me a new one within 5 days and he's loved it ever since. Would do business with them again.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|And practical. It has kept my Kindle safe on planes, ferries, in my backpack, and it doesn't take up excess space.
159562015X|5.0|I had to do this for work.  It was accurate, just like I thought it would be.  Interesting how a bunch of questions can tell you about yourself.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Nice little hold me over until the September novel came out. Liked the back story aspect of this one. Thanks.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Started watching Lost Girl during season 2-couldn't wait for Season 1 to come out on DVD and was not disappointed. Anxiously awaiting season 3 on tv & will probably purchase season 2 just to have it on hand.
B0089LOMJC|5.0|Honest and full of his musical insights. Tons of good stories and it makes you want to listen to everything they've (the who) have done.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|To me this is the best Bourne movie yet. The plot was more interesting than any of the previous versions and wasn't dominated by special effects.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved it the first time and re-read it again after hearing about a Marine friend's use of it for his subordinates. It is required reading. But it is a great story.<br />Ender's Shadow is the best follow up (fourth book, I think) I've ever read but I didn't get it through Amazon so can't review it here, but it is great. All about Bean, if you remember him...
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|A mutant's powers usually manifest at puberty, and often during emotional trama. At the beginning fans see Logan's powers manifest. Bone claws and animal strength and attitude emerge, accompanied by healing power. The film tells how Logan and Victor, who will eventually become Wolverine and Saber Tooth, are half brothers. How each is innately quite similar, but both become quite different.  Victor slowly becomes savage and brutal, Logan becomes feral and primal. Victor a monster, and Logan a warrior and lover.<br /><br />Logan is manipulated into volunteering for the adamantium experiment. The process is so damaging that Logan's system flat lines for a minute. Then his healing factor brings him back. His bones made invulnerable, and his claws turned into blades.<br /><br />This movie explains Stryker's hatred of mutants, and his connection to Wolverine. Explains how Logan got amnesia, and the reason for his code name \\"Wolverine\\". Accompanied by intense battle, and powerful love - this is highly entertaining. This is the origin of the best X-Man.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So poorly written I couldn't get to 30 pages. I'm sure there is a huge market for it out there, but I've had a satisfying sex life and didn't need the titillation. She's one lucky &#34;writer&#34;.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Odin was a king. As Kings were originally meant to be. He was a formidable warrior and wise leader. He puts the prosperity of Asgard above all else. He was ready for war, but never sought it.  Thor was a warrior also, but not yet a leader. He had grown arrogant - hungry not just for battle, but for war. He wrongly saw war as glorious. For his arrogance Thor was banished, stripped of his powers, and cut off from home. He had to survive as just a man. Not superhuman and not royalty. Throughout his exile he makes friends with ordinary people and falls for a brilliant woman. He accepts that he can't go home.  Thor's enemies from Asgard still try to kill him, even after he stops trying to return home. His old friends seek to save him, and almost get killed in the process. To save his friends(both old and new) and more importantly the woman he loves, Thor willing sacrifices himself. He was ready to die for them. In that sacrifice he became worthy of the power he'd been stripped of - the power to lead, protect, and vanquish.  He'd gained True Nobility - the Power of a King.  With his powers restored Thor went on to protect those he loved.  Earth and Asgard were under the protection of the Super-Human Warrior the Vikings had once worshiped as the God of Thunder.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Darker is a well planned second to Fifty....can't wait to be \\"Freed\\"! Thoroughly have enjoyed the journey thus far.... enticing!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The older Reacher gets the closer attention to detail and the more intimate examination of Reacher's thoughts we get. I would much rather have Reacher's mind than his fists. Anyone can haul off and punch someone. How many people can deduce a sinister plot is developing from a cold bottle of water and no one needing the rest room? Bravo for another super duper read! It's all about the journey and Reacher is a travelling man!
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Overall, I like this flick. The acting was quite good and the story was well done. Clever story and very suspenseful. But the brutality of Benicio Del Toro, who I really like, was too intense in 3-4 spots.
B005LAII3U|5.0|I like this movie. It has great special effects, great artwork, and Blade Runner-like sets. Colin Farrell was much, much better than Arnold--though I enjoy his acting too(stick around). Kate Beckinsale is simply the most beautiful woman alive. She is a talented actor to boot. Sharon Stone was great in her version, but Kate is over the top. Jessica Biel is mind-candy, not to mention eye-candy. I have not watched both cuts yet, but I'm very impressed so far. Oh, look closely Twilight fans and see some familiar faces. This is a five-star movie. Oh, I had to buy the movie on another site. For some reason I could not find it on Amazon at the time. Sorry about that, Amazon. I buy everything from Amazon.
0307719774|5.0|The book is exactly what you think it is. Some of the questions are kinda weird and unsure how to answer but it's still pretty cool.  Glad I bought it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Just a pleasure to watch!  The actors and scenes are perfect.  Every minute makes you think of villages in Britain.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I have young children, and I was afraid that it would be too scary for them but they loved it. They laughed pretty much the whole movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. it is fun and also it is a very addictive and I would reccomend this game to anybody who asked... This game has a lot of levels and is great for anyone that likes logic games...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fast,  easy read....ready for number 3. I didn't read book one but saw the movie. Easy to pick up where movie left off.
B002SKDGRE|4.0|The background and historical information about the activities and life of Marc Rich are well worth knowing.<br />I beleive that not enough peopel know about thegood he did for teh West, despite what some American legal &#34;experts&#34; might feel. His contribution to society will be felt for many years to come.<br />If it had not been for his enterprising entrpeneurship the world would be very different today<br />I woudl ceratinly recommend this book
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I haven't seen this one on my list yo download . :-(  what is the problem with this app? Does it work with the Kindle FIRE?
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is a little bit hard but when you get it, it becomes really fun. It also have some trouble with the money on the game that sometimes disappears but still worth it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is the show that has grabbed so many viewers. It is not fast-paced or intensely paced, but it is an emotional story of a family that pulls you in and holds you. The feel of the show is very Jane Austenesque, with a little edge to it. The first season has some scandal and intrigue, while the second season really develops the characters, causing you to feel each ones' individual story and somehow cheer each one on. A fantastic show.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought one book at a time in case I didn't like the first one.  I'm almost through the last book book and I can't wait to rent the movie.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I would like it better if I new how to play the game.  It tells you what you cant do but I would like to know what I can do and what some are called.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very very good read.  You think you know the outcome, but there's .a lot of twists and turns. So  Wrong!!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Our 4 year old plays with this for hours unattended.<br />Perfect level for her to learn and be entertained.<br />Looking to get similar app soon.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game ruined my life. with how fun and addictive it is. Play at your own risk. Especially if you are a brony!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|We are completely new to the Kindle Fire as we just bought it for Xmas.  We tried and tried to get eBay to work on the Fire and had no idea why it would not allow us to search our account.  After an hour of trying to enter name and password with no success we find that you had to download this app before being able to access our eBay account.  Once downloaded it worked perfectly.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|After I installed the game it worked fine.  A few days later I tried to play Angry Birds Seasons and it won't let me in.  I'm annoyed that it won't open for me.  I'll have to have someone check it out for me.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Just a clock and alarm. No options unless you upgrade. Ad is at the bottom of screen all the time.
B00005KK9M|5.0|Very fun to listen to,again. , \Brings back alot of great memories of my High school daze :=o)<br /><br />Great tunes,<br />Thanx!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This again, was a gift.  No comments on my part.  I cannot comment on whether I like it or not.
B000002GB4|5.0|Another popular tape, from back in my day. &#34;I might be old, but I got to see Alot of Great Bands
1416914285|5.0|a  person cannot write a review for something that is a christmas gift.  In this case, it was for my grandson.  Once again, do not publish my comments for it is embarrassing when it's a gift, not something for personal consumption.
B009329Y30|5.0|This was a great movie.  Very good story line and great ending.  Renting it on my Kindle and watching it was a wonderful way to view any movie.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Great movie if your a stoned 15 yr old. Pretty funny if your a 30 year old who is not stoned like me...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Action packed, great story that kept me coming back for more! I just didn't want to put it down! Can't wait for the next one!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This game has been great so far but is getting hung up in the middle. Going to download again to see if that fixes problem.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great job. However the author should have spared us the politics and allow us to make our own deductions. A recommended read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a great game but its annoying to have to get coins to unlock games. other than that I like it!!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|When I first got the app, it worked perfectly fine, but then it just stopped working. I tried to take a pic on camera mode and it said Can't connect to camera. And then when I try to take a video it says  The HD Camera is not responding right now Force Closed? And you have to press yes.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|My son is a HUGE Lego fan!  He absolutely loved this set and wants all of the winter village sets.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Solitaire,  game okay but too many pop ups.  Remove ads and game would be okay.  The movement is smooth & easy
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|the movie quality was very good for streaming on my xbox 360.  the movie was action packed but a little light on depth (I know what was I expecting).  Would recommend for action buffs.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book was really good and I read it in 3 days.... I really liked it and am probably gonna see the movie!!!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Good music.  Love Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson is genius!  Pretty predictable, but nice light hearted comedy.  They did a nice job overall.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought the book was good one of the best but at the end it just left you hanging it didn't really have an ending but it really was a good book
B000I9YWDO|2.0|A slow moving slapstick comedy.  Jennifer Anniston has done herself no favors by taking a part in this \\"B\\" movie which does not show her talent.  Along with the rap music backgrounds and weak plot, poor direction and marginal acting, this is barely a two star movie.
B00992CF6W|4.0|my brother plays this game every day but his kindle reset itself and it wont re download .. NEED HELP !!!!! any suggestions?
B006TVQU6C|4.0|Like the USB 3, not so sure about the rest of it.<br /><br />First off this is a dirt cheap case for what it is. Bonus for that.<br /><br />Easy to work with for the most part.<br /><br />Fatal flaw is the massive unfiltered intake ports, the whole bottom of this case is open to air without a filter!
0547564651|3.0|Like others, I found much of the material in this book interesting, but also found it impractical in many respects. There is even one point where he discusses others attempting to implement the ideals presented and finding no results. It sort of results in an implicit \\"You can try to integrate this stuff into classrooms, but it probably won't work, at least without more specific training.\\" That's rather frustrating.<br /><br />In addition, the section on chess felt rather long and disconnected. There were a few good points in there, but much of the section was just storytelling that didn't seem necessary to his overall thesis.<br /><br />Still, Tough presents compelling ideas, if not necessarily new ones in this day and age, as others have offered similar work. Practical followups to these sorts of books would be a significant boon, I think.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Excellent read. Kept my attention and thoroughly enjoyed the multifaceted characters. I look forward to reading the next books in the series.
0618918248|1.0|I will confess that this is yet another book I did not finish. I stopped perhaps 40% of the way through. I feel my time could be far better devoted to other research.<br /><br />Dawkins posits a few good arguments, but the majority of what he puts forth is just as flawed as the arguments that he seeks to refute, and it's unpleasant to boot. While being indignant at his opponents' name-calling, he insults them and their arguments regularly with an air of self-righteousness and anger that fills the metaphorical space. He, so far as I read, does not acknowledge his own presuppositions and assumptions, let alone argue why they might be better than any others, while calling his opponents' absurd. He stands firmly on the tenets of science, which others have rightly pointed to as his own faith/religion, demanding that the supernatural conform to the laws of the natural, a perspective that is akin to demanding that one should abolish Java because its rules do not conform to C++ or that laws in Saudi Arabia are faulty simply because they aren't grounded on British legal philosophy and structure.<br /><br />It is theoretically possible that Dawkins is correct. However, the more he said, the more I didn't want him to be correct, simply to spite his pompousness and rage. If Dawkins is an example of human evolution apart from religious faith, then I'll take a world with faith simply because it would be a more pleasant place. True, he argues that the world would be better without religion in later chapters, but I can't imagine his logic will be any more sound there than it did at the beginning.
B00ARAO720|2.0|Don't bother.  Stupid story.  Totally contrived.  Average acting and below average dialogue.  After the terrific opening shot, it's all down hill (with a helmet, of course).
034580404X|1.0|I bought it to see what all the hype was about. Wasted my money. Poorly written. One star is one too many.
B0057LUI0O|4.0|Great kids movie.  Loved the shots of Rio, made  me want to go there.  Kids really enjoyed it and would watch again.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great book.  I wanted to keep reading to see what happened next!<br /><br />Can't wait for the next book to be released!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Loved this movie.  Not too scary for little ones (6 years old was my youngest).  Lots of fun for all.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|cute and fun. I enjoy the added games and playing with the characters. the fact the voice actors are the same is awesome.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|not like the first season.  more gory but does touch on controversial subjects that are now accepted, don't want to be a spoiler
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I need another Fifty book. What am I going to do for pleasure now that I've finished the trilogy in less than 3 days?
B003VANOFY|1.0|I have had this type of headset 2 times the past 4 years. Each time the headset has only lasted a couple of years. The sound quality is great on them, but for small heads, it does not fit very well. The construction on these headsets are total crap. The first time, the headset fell off my head as I was walking in my house to do laundry, and the top headpiece shattered. I had to duct tape it, and then I could not adjust it to fit my head. So I bought another pair and after a year, the plug in the left ear that charges the headset would not function or charge the set. I received another set for Christmas, and yet again, the plastic has broken on the headset, this time it's the plastic around the ears pieces that swivels. I just gently took them off one day and the plastic cracked! I am thoroughly disappointed with this product as it is highly rated, and I loved the fact you could still use the product while it was still charging, you just couldn't go wireless with it while it charged. I loved the fact that it was affordable, but I guess you truly get what you pay for!!
B009D7CP2M|5.0|This book is a must read. I couldn't put it down.  It is a page turner the whole way through and I highly recommend it to those who enjoy reading about the insight into a complicated life.  For anyone who has ever wondered what must go through the mind of the parents who have to live with the fact that their children committed an awful crime, this is a great book.
B001993Y3G|5.0|After I ordered this movie, I saw complaints by consumers, that only half of the movie was there, and that concerned me.  I received my copy of the extended edition on Blu-ray, today. I played it right away.  The whole movie was there. No problems whatsoever.  The sound and picture quality were excellent, with no glitches at all.  The entire movie was on one side of the disc, which I was very pleased with. The first copy I bought back when it first came out on regular DVD, was a two-sided disc, which I had no problem with flipping it to watch the rest.  Although,I am glad I no longer have to deal with that anymore.  The additional scenes gave the movie a more dark side to it.  The only scene that should have been left out, was when the sheriff cut out the Scribe's tongue.  Later on in the movie, the Scribe had to write on a chalkboard in order to talk. However, when the Moor and Robin Hood stormed the palace, Robin asked the Scribe where Lady Marian was, he was able to tell him where she was.  Generally, a person can't talk without a tongue.  Apparently, the editors didn't think about that particular detail.  I am willing to overlook that technicality, because overall, this is an excellent movie. :)
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was very funny - Anna Kendrick is very entertaining.  The music choices were great and overall I really enjoyed this movie.
B001EKP5FK|5.0|Love these movies!! Thank you.  These are exactly what I was hoping for,  Love Barbara, she is fabulous.<br />Product in good condition.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|When I first saw that they came out with a new Bloons Tower Defense I was a bit nervous. I had beaten number four and was wondering what changes they made. The ones the made were great. I absolutely love the new game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After the first chapter I was hooked. When sky and holder finally meet and start there relationship I've never wanted two people to kiss more then sky and holder. Talk about twist and turns  there are so many in this book but I couldn't get enough of each of them. At one point I had my kindle sitting on my coffee table reading the next thing I know I've snatched it up and is yelling wtf... every twist drives u further into the story<br />Like this book no I loved it!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the jetpacks and mystery boxes poop the people it should be completely custom create your own face makeup body height but really fun game.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|It is pretty difficult.  I found this one the hardest of the three and had to use the hints often.  I love these type games and I wish they would make more!
B0086700CM|5.0|enjoying this game. competing against my sister makes it even better,  we take pictures of our scores and send them to each other.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I got the MP3 version for five dollars, so I'm more than pleased. It's a MUST HAVE if you saw the movie and even if you didn't yet and are dying to hear some of the songs. Granted, some songs are missing but that doesn't diminish the value of the ones you're getting. I wish people would just comment on the quality of what they hear rather than point out the obvious because it's not like it's a secret that it doesn't include all the songs. I'll recommend it to anyone who saw the film and loved it as much as I did.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Reminded me of a lifetime movie. Most of the book was very predictable.  Not what I expected from this author..
B005EGXTEE|4.0|After seeing the movie I decided to read the book and was glad that I did.  It was a lot more detailed than the movie and filled in a lot of gaps left by the movie.  Not a stand alone book, you really need to read all three to get the full benefit.  Well worth the time.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Look at the developer's name.  &quot;kyy&quot; looks soooooo legit, right?  Look at the TITLE.  &quot;google search board&quot;, with NO CAPITALS.  Tell me you downloaded this app without reading the DESCRIPTION, REVIEWS, OR TAKING A LONGER LOOK AT THE TITLE.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Third and final book of the Hunger Games Triology and not really a stand alone novel.  A lot more violent than the other two but equally as good.  Loved the set and found them thought provoking and very entertaining.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter as it is is a pretty basic service so there isn't much they could screw up with this app. Flows well and looks great.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|I loved this series but you need to read all three in the trilogy starting with the Hunger Games.  The series is quite thought provoking and fairly violent.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a very nice moble version of Facebook. It flows well. If they find a way to add the messenger portion it will be near perfect.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|I love the app and its easy to use. I do us a Nintendo stylus to write which makes it easier to use. But when u create a notebook how do you write in it? And if the had labels so that u can know what you're clicking on that would be great. Other than that I love this app and highly recommend it. And you might loose a notebook but there probably is a slight chance you will loose you device. Easier to keep up with!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Saw the movie first and then got the trilogy.  Now I can't wait until the next two movies come out!!!  The stories were full of twists and turns and expected outcomes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book I give it 5 stars really liked it good good good good good good good good book nice
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I got this for my new Kindle Fire HD that was a gift for me. So far it is working great for me. Thank you very much.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I got this movie for my husband and he loves it!!!  The DVD works very well and we have had no problems with it.  I like that you can see the theatrical version and an unrated version.  I haven't been able to view the whole movie but from what I've seen it is very hilarious!!!
B0038ZITIE|5.0|I bought this for my husband for a Christmas present. I had to hide it for a few weeks because I received it so fast. He was extremely happy to get this movie. Thank you very much.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|My husband, five year old daughter and I saw this in the movie theatre....so it was only natural we get the DVD.  The DVD itself works well and we've had no problems with it!!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney's cd is Awesome!!!!!!!!  I really enjoy her all the songs on her cd.  May you RIP in peace My Lady.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I would definitely recommend this show. It took a few episodes for me to like it, but that is because I was coming into it from being a fan of the original NCIS. I love the characters and storylines/plots; it has a very clever, witty, and funny script. I really like this show once I gave it a chance.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|never knew much bout my wifi till i dwnloaded this app! Now i know which channel is best for me:-)

B0002F6AH0|5.0|If anyone has the slightest interest concerning the Second World War, this is THE program to obtain. The quality of this product from narration onward is gripping and enlightening. A &#34;must have&#34; for any history buff and a &#34;must see&#34; for anyone who cares about this horrible conflict and the many causes and effects thereof.<br /><br /> &#34;To remain ignorant of things that happened before you were born is to remain a child.&#34;<br />  Cicero
B0084BMUFA|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good little ghost story. It is a good reminder for us all to keep the pure joy of Christmas alive no matter our situation
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this book this rating because this book exceeded my expectations! There was nothing I disliked and I would recommend this to anyone who likes drama incorporated with action!
B003H9M1Q2|1.0|When I tried to play this DVD on my bluray machine it says \\"DuD\\"<br />When I tried to play on another combo DVD/VHS machine it says \\"Incorrect Disc\\"<br />When I play it on anohter combo DVD/VHS machine it plays.<br />This should play on all machines. It says it is \\"enhanced\\" so you would think it would play on my newest machine and not on the oldest.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I liked it. If at least one person likes it, you should give it a shot. That's about all I've got to say.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good read, wish  this was the beginning of a series. Very easy read and enjoyable love love love love love
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book!!!! I was reading it then I went to the next page.... and I realized I finished reading the book!!!! A 217 or 271 page book (I really forget how many pages) I was finished reading it in like 4 days!!!!! That's like my record!!! I was NEVER a book person but these books are AMAZING!!!!!! I NEVER thought I would Finnish that book SO quickly and when I realized I finished the book I was like \\"the book is already done!?\\" I was SO surprised and I totally think these books are the best series I EVER read!!!!!!!
B005LAIGSM|3.0|Bought this movie, watched it once, that was enough. Don't remember much about it because, it didn't have a very memorable or meaningful plot. I normally watch movies over and over again. Unfortunately this movie is collecting dust in my collection. I don't feel like I need to watch it ever again. I am also not a fan of Channing Tatum's performance. There were several scenes where he demonstrated some terrible acting skills! I also didn't understand or care for the way it ends. (Don't want to spoil it for anyone). Rachel McAdams will always be a great actress, in my opinion. However my expectations of her are high after The Notebook.This movie doesn't even compare. Would not buy this movie- wish I had bought The Notebook, although I have seen it a million times.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I recommend this book to people that do really like to read BC once I read It I was very surprised I actually liked it! I thought it was a five star rated book BC it explains everything really well.I don't like to read but this was actually a really good book.<br /><br />  !GOOD BOOK FOR 6th graders!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|There are not many books that have grabbed me and held onto me like this book did. One chapter lead right nto the next and I could not put it down. I was a little disappointed when Sadie was killed during the assassination attempt but only because I knew what George was gonna do after that. I was surprised though that it did not happen the way I expected. Wonderful book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was good<br />I don't really want to write eleven more words but I am required to and now I'm finally done.
B005PK553C|5.0|I love everything about this show! So good, and just keeps getting better with season 2. Cast is great, story line is great, the only complaint is that it's not long enough.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love the irreverent John Corey character, and the background information on Yemen and its culture is fascinating - if frightening.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|What a mess.<br /><br />This movie was painful to watch. It just seemed like they were trying so hard to make something unique.<br /><br />Well, they succeeded in making a uniquely lame movie that was far weaker than the first two. I didn't care about any of the characters. Bane was a horrible villain who wasn't evil, but just gross. Compare him to Raoul in Skyfall. Now that's a great villain that people love to hate. Cat Woman was pointless, except for a bit of eye candy and Alfred should have just left at the beginning and stayed in Florence.  I love Michael Caine as an actor, but never bought into the cockney version of Alfred, but I'm not sure I've ever heard Caine speak any other way, except Cider House Rules.<br /><br />Maybe they should start over and see if a third series might be the charm. The first series of movies were just as bad and muddled throughout. Michael Keaton? Val Kilmer? George Clooney? Why not Bruce Campbell? At least he doesn't have a<br />speech impediment like the rest - including Bale (who rarely closes his mouth in this film like he has a stuffed nose.)<br /><br />I'd take Adam West and the TV series over any of the movies even though I did enjoy the first two Christian Bale movies despite the annoying Batman voice. At least the TV show knew it was camp and didn't drown everyone in the dark and twisted psychological goo that the Hollywood films were always pushing to match the later comics.<br /><br />See it, but don't pay much,  if anything.
0385535147|3.0|Found the pace a little slow and his main character, Malcolm, was not compelling.  But there's a lot of interesting info about gold trading, FBI fumbling, and over all sneakiness as Malcolm slips in and out of countries.  Surprised to read at the end that the author did very little research because there's an authenticity to so much of it-especially location-but he's probably been many of the locations and he's very observant.  Grisham is a clever author and a fabulous storyteller.  I'd give 5 stars to a lot of his books-not this one.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|I was waiting for this movie for a long time... so many good actors, looks like a  perfect different comedy ... and don't get me wrong it is an OK movie to watch, but I was expecting much more.<br /><br />There is a part where Anna Kendrick (Becka) says to Skylar Astin (Jess) \\"Movies, they are fine I just get bored and never make it to the end... they are predictable, the guy gets the girl, the kid sees death people...\\"<br />I was hoping this movie wasn't predictable or at least very funny  but neither... the love story between them runs so fast that is impossible to  get, it's like  they just had  1 hour and 30 minutes to fit all the  story and they fast speed everything, I know it's a movie but at least make it  a little bit credible.<br /><br />Defenitly Rebel Wilson saved the movie and a glimpse of the  legendary \\"McLoving\\" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse),  the \\"Workoholic dude\\" (Adam Devine), and the funny Elizabeth Banks but they barely made the movie.<br /><br />The marketing team did a good job and sold the movie, for me some parts are really lame but this is just my opinion, -from a movie freak - I guess sense of humor varies from person to person (definitely).
B0071R43MG|4.0|This is very enjoyable, and probably showcases one of the best performances of Joe. Good sound and video. The band is tight and sounds perfect. Beats other releases, and hope this sets a new standard.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|My daughter 8, got ahold of her aunts vhs of this movie and asked me to find it on dvd, and amazon can always be counted on! Was really glad it was just a click away!
B00181JGI2|4.0|Classic performances by all!  Classic Coen Brothers!  This movie is a show that can be watched over and over again.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|My 8 year old loves disney channel and all the music she listens to usually is a disney channel star. This album is really good. I enjoy listening to it myself. I hope bridgit mendler sticks to her roots and stays clean. So many of the disney channel artists &#34; turn&#34; after a few years in the music world and i hope to continue to see great things from her that my child will still be able to listen to! On a parent note this album is great and safe!
B001S86J2Q|5.0|great quality and price for this classic movie! the blu ray quality was amazing. we are very happy with the purchase.

B009MCRHH6|3.0|Amazing game, but I get frequent freezes on my Samsung Epic 4G.  I'm talking like every time I play. Probably it's my lame phone, but I hope it can be fixed.
B000OBYLVO|4.0|Although I'm not much on romantic comedies, I did like this one. Pedictable through out, the stars acting made me overlook this fact, and Eli Wallach was just a joy to watch.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is a fun and fast game to play. Love that it is big in size on my new acer.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I loved this book, even though it was a little gruesome and scary. It was exciting and suspenseful and had a fairly quick pace.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|wish I got a full game. but its pretty interesting.<br /><br />I am not sure at this point if I will purchase the game or delete it.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book and have already ordered the second one. I can't wait for the 3rd to come out in 2013.
0898159156|5.0|This book is extremely informative and is sure to help my CP collection grow by leaps and bounds. The book is well written and is very easy to understand. Every chapter is full of information on these wonderful plants, and any owner of this book should not have a problem with cp's ever again!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|This is basically a two-hour episode of Glee set in '80s L.A. with period music and terrific performances all around. If you are a GLEEK you will love it: if you aren't you won't.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Great film about acceptance; about seeing beyond the surface and not judging.  Lost a star because of the closing gag.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I will start by saying this movie is very different from Tarantino's previous works. As far as I know, this is his first film that follows the traditional chronological order. Additionally, we follow Django around most of the film, similar to how we follow the Bride in the Kill Bill series. This is different from, say, Pulp Fiction or Inglourious Basterds. While I prefer the more epic storytelling style better, that didn't hold me back from loving this film. The writing in this film doesn't disappoint. It meets the high standard Tarantino has set with his previous films. There really wasn't a dull moment in this film. This film was very dark at times, from a vicious Mandingo fight (in my opinion, the most brutal scene), to a man getting ripped apart by bloodthirsty dogs. However, a very healthy dose of humor made it easier to watch. There were scenes where I couldn't believe my eyes, and there were other scenes where I was in tears from laughter, and neither side seemed to outweigh the other. Jamie Foxx was good in this, however, Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio really stole the show. I really liked Waltz's character as a German bounty hunter better than his portrayal as \\"The Jew Hunter\\" in Inglourious Basterds. It was also clever how they stuck in the original Django in the bar scene. One actor that I wish I could have seen more of was Walton Goggins as Billy Crash. I have always said he is a great actor and I loved his character on The Shield, I just wish we got to see more of his character in this work. There were some interesting musical cues to say the least. I love the soundtrack, especially the \\"Django\\" theme. Even the hip-hop worked for such a historical setting, which was hilariously awesome, and maybe even a first for cinema. Django Unchained is anything but predictable, and I absolutely loved the last 30 minutes of the film.<br /><br />I don't have a lot of complaints about this film, but I do have a few that are worth discussing. First and foremost:there are a few pacing issues in Django Unchained, most prominently near the climax of the film. Some scenes seemed a bit too long, and some were too short. However, these pacing issues weren't enough to hinder the film's flow. Secondly, I thought Quentin Tarantino's appearance in this film should have been omitted. His performance was poor, to say the least. Maybe I've watched one too many interviews with him, but I wasn't buying his fake southern accent. Pulp Fiction Tarantino: Yes. Django Unchained Tarantino: No. I guess that's what you get from a director that always has cameos in his films: either a hit or miss.<br /><br />Django Unchained is one of the best films I've seen this year, if not, the best. It's right up there with Looper, and I am already anticipating Django's Blu-Ray release. Django Unchained is a bloody, brutal, hilarious, and bold film that throws us into America's dark past of slavery and adds a dash of fantasy to it to make a phenomenal Western (or Southern, as QT insists it is?). Of all of Quentin Tarantino's films, I'd say this is one that is the most straightforward and easiest to follow, which may be a good entry film for QT newbies to start at. All in all, this is a highly recommended film that I consider to be classic Tarantino.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Was this a movie based on the game, or just extreme product placement?  Not sure, don't care, still tons of fun.
B0092QITO2|2.0|There are a few things I really enjoyed about this film.  I liked how it was fast-paced.  There were some solid action sequences and well choreographed fight scenes.  I think Colin Farrell was an okay cast.  I even enjoyed the set design in this film.  The first half of the film was even very enjoyable, but after that, this turned into a Michael Bay-style film.<br /><br />I could make several comparisons between this film and The Island.  This felt like the same kind of style; the pacing, action, and characters were almost parallel.  Colin Farrell's performance was good, but almost every negative thing about the film made it hard for me to care what happened to his character. Another issue I had was the redundant action scenes.  Chase scene after chase scene...they were all the same, nothing to set one apart from the other.<br /><br />I can get over that stuff.  What I cannot get over is more of a technical issue: the lens flares.  I noticed tons of lens flares in the trailer, which meant I knew I'd see even more in the film.  Not only does this look tacky, it is cliche and unnecessary...not only in this film, but in the majority of other films that utilize this effect.  It became annoying and distracting and I found myself mentally deducting stars from this film just based on that reason.  That's how bad it was.<br /><br />In conclusion, Total Recall is a watchable Sci-Fi film that is unnecessary but mildly enjoyable because of how fast of a watch it is.  Fast-paced action, although repetitive, makes for an easy, thoughtless viewing.  No need for a second pass.
B008Y2X78S|5.0|this was a great show. It also had a great pacing. Really exciting at the end.  and it keeps getting better and better. It's almost as if I never want the show to end.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|While this movie was a disappointment, I have to say, there were a lot of great things about this film.  First and foremost, the action was spectacular.  A combination of artistic cinematography, graceful and intentional editing, and well-paced choreography made for some stellar action scenes.  The Bourne movies are well known for their great fast-paced, quick-cut action scenes, and this film does not fail to continue that style.  I would dare to say that the action alone in this film warrants a viewing.  One scene in particular caught my eye.  It was a scene where a doctor shoots up the lab he is working in.  This was a very terrifying scene, even for a PG-13 rating.  It felt very realistic and although it was a dark scene, it was very well done.  A more subtle element I liked about this film was the continuation of the water theme.  Every Bourne film starts with a water theme, and they continued this into the fourth film.  It helps connect the films in a way and I really liked that.  I also liked the cast of Edward Norton, although I wish I would have seen more of his character.  Rachel Weisz's performance was good, although I greatly disliked her character.  All her character did was scream, yell, and beg for Aaron to save her in several points in the film.  I was indifferent about Jeremy Renner.  I liked him as an action star, but I don't think he or anyone else for that matter should be taking the place of Matt Damon.<br /><br />Other than the action scenes, this film lacked many of the elements that made the first three Bourne films so good, specifically the pacing.  This movie was EXTREMELY slow for a Bourne film.  There was probably 15 minutes of solid action in this movie, and I expected more from a Bourne movie, whether Matt Damon starred or not.  The trailer gave away most of the good parts of the film, which is probably why I was so disappointed.  Also, for whatever reason, Matt Damon's character was repeatedly brought up throughout the film.  If we're not going to see him on screen, there's no reason to bring him up.  Every mention of Jason Bourne made me think about how cheap the writers were being trying to transition from one actor to the other.  Another complaint I had was how awkwardly the movie ended.  Immediately after an intense motorcycle chase, we are suddenly on a boat in the ocean with Aaron and Marta, and they escape, more or less, away from everything.  It seemed like there were some loose ends that needed to be tied up, rather than jumping straight from the climax of the film to the end.  That was a very jarring way to end the film and left me with a bad feeling walking out of the theater, which is something good filmmakers never do.<br /><br />The latest Bourne film is more of a redundancy than a legacy.  I'm not saying that Matt Damon's absence from this film is the reason it wasn't very good, but it's hard to watch a movie of this caliber with a well-established star without having him in the back of your mind.  It is easily the weakest of the Bourne films, however, I would recommend giving it a watch solely based on the fact that the action scenes were great.
0545128285|5.0|After reading the HP series, I was so upset and sad that it was over.  Having this and reading what &#34;parents read to their children of the wizardry world&#34; is just an awesome thing to have in my library.  Awesome book.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Honestly, I went in expecting a slow, boring film. My co-workers USUALLY don't steer me wrong. I should have listened to their advice before going into the train wreck that is The Bourne Legacy. I was pleasantly surprised. While there wasn't quite as much action as I had anticipated, the film made up for it with witty and comic dialogue. There were several instances where the audience would burst into laughter and chuckle. The writers clearly put a lot of thought into appealing to non-Bond fans, which made this a somewhat easy watch. The cinematography in this film is phenomenal. Editing was pretty good, too. I loved the fight scene on the rooftop, where the fight is shot in just one angle, which is rare to find in modern action scenes.<br /><br />There were a few things I didn't like about film. I wish we could've seen more of Javier Bardem's character. His character wasn't very fleshed out, either. Additionally, the final action sequence was a little disappointing. There were a lot of setups for this scene, and the payoffs happened so fast, it seemed silly with how much time was spent on them. Finally, the soundtrack was nothing to write home about, especially the title song.<br /><br />In conclusion, I must say this is one of the better Bond films I've seen. This one really made me like Daniel Craig as James Bond, which is something I never thought I would say. Skyfall is a solid Bond film that fans and non-fans can appreciate and enjoy.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After reading the Hunger Games I had to finish out the story. I enjoyed the book and it was hard to put down.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I will start off with what I liked most about this film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance as the younger Bruce Willis is nothing short of spectacular. In fact, his performance really sold the film and made it believable. Yeah, the makeup really helped, too, but JGL's sharp talent for transforming into another role (rather than mimicking it) completely changed the tone of the film. Looper easily could have been JGL chasing down Bruce Willis, but that was not the case. This was a young Bruce Willis chasing down an older Bruce Willis. Rather than the traditional man vs. man theme, this film effectively and creatively utilized the man vs. self theme, which I enjoyed.<br /><br />I also liked the visuals of this film. The futuristic world in this film is very feasible. I look at this world and think that it could actually exist someday. Rian Johnson clearly put a lot of thought into the setting. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography and editing was beautiful. This film distinguishes itself with its unique text, narration, and, most of all, fantastic camerawork. I wish I could describe the visual style of this film, but it is so unique and unlike anything I have ever seen before.<br /><br />As far as the acting goes, I really have no complaints. As I said before, JGL was brilliant. I'd say this is Bruce Willis' best film in years. I was skeptical about Emily Blunt's character, but I came to like her and was sold on the idea of her being a country girl. Even her kid was great. Usually, I hate little kids in movies. They are almost always obnoxious and are usually used for low-grade humor. This wasn't the case in Looper. I can't say much without giving away key plot points, but the boy's performance and role in the film is amazing.<br /><br />I really have no complaints about this film, other than how slow it can be. The trailer makes you think this will be a fast-paced action film, but much of the action in the trailer plays out as quick montages in the film, which was a little disappointing. I think I would have liked just a little more action, and with this film being just under two hours, it could have spared a few more minutes of that.<br /><br />Looper is a groundbreaking film on so many levels. It is well-written and thought-out, visually striking, and expertly acted. This film lived up to my high expectations, which is a rarity. Looper will definitely be added to my Blu-Ray collection. Highly recommended for Sci-Fi and Action fanatics, and anyone who wants to experience a mind-bending thriller.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Two Graves<br />Preston and Childs grab you with the first page.  Agent Pendergast comes to life again and Helen, too.
B009MF56GC|4.0|The thing I really liked about this film was the cast.  You gotta love the star-studded cast of The Expendables 2, especially if you are an action fan like myself.  There are some great fight scenes and like The Avengers, this film does a good job of balancing screen time so you get to see everyone in action.  The fast pace of the film kept it from being a drag, and it was a very fast watch.  One liners and bad acting also make this film hilarious, and I was bursting out laughing at some of the scenes with poorly written dialogue.  I also liked how this film payed homage to older action films, such as The Terminator and Die Hard, by referencing classic lines from those films.  All these elements together made this a very entertaining action film.  As long as you come into the film expecting to have some fun and not take it seriously, you will have a good time with it.<br /><br />While this was one of the more fun films I've seen this summer, there were a lot of flaws with it.  We didn't get to see a whole lot of Jean-Claude Van Damme, which is disappointing because he could've made a great, rather than good villain.  Stallone overshadowed a lot of the cast.  Also, the acting in this film is pretty bad.  That made it more fun for me, but it might not be as enjoyable for everyone else.  This film was also very cliche, although that was probably intended.  Finally, my biggest complaint is the addition of a female to the Expendables team.  That's all I will say about that.<br /><br />The Expendables 2 is a solid action film with plenty of laughs and fun.  If you can get past the cliched story, bad acting, and overused CGI blood, this is a good action film with good intentions.  I recommend this film to anyone that enjoys action films, particularly 80s and 90s action films.
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|Weird story; kind of silly and having a hard time getting part that.  More for kids, I think. Typical hidden picture game though.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|I expected this to be a Tom-Cruise-Kicks-Ass-For-120-mins film, which would have been the worst-case scenario. The trailer didn't reveal much, but it seemed to market this film as strictly an action film. I enjoyed the bits of humor sprinkled within the film. There is also a surprising amount of depth and mystery to this film which was pleasing, however, that's about the extent of the strengths of this film.<br /><br />Jack Reacher doesn't bring a whole lot to the table as far as the mystery and crime genre go. This was a fairly predictable film and I didn't find any of the characters interesting or fleshed out in the least. The title character is extremely bland and we get little to no character development. I can't help but say that Tom Cruise's talents were wasted with this film because he played a role that Nicolas Cage easily could have played just as well. The character was poorly written and Tom Cruise apparently didn't have much to work with which led to a very uninteresting and one-dimensional character. The villains weren't very interesting either, which made the drama less exciting, to put it bluntly. Fight scenes were poorly choreographed, and the final action scene was just dull.<br /><br />Jack Reacher isn't a terrible action/crime film in any sense. The humor greatly cushions this very average installment, but it's not enough to push me to a recommendation. Jack Reacher is a film I've seen hundreds of times, only the T's are crossed a bit differently.
B0010X745K|4.0|Always good to rewatch. Alot of the cast from &#34;Walking Dead&#34; appear in this film. Not alot of major hitters in this movie but, the cast holds it's own.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|This film was generally well-received by critics and audiences alike, so I went in expecting what most Disney films deliver: family-friendly content that normally doesn't require any serious emotional or intellectual investment.  I actually laughed out loud at a few parts, which surprised me.  When I saw the trailer, I thought the humor was going to be obnoxious crap in a desperate attempt to appeal to the younger audience, but I was pleased with the way it was done.<br /><br />The storyline is a bit strange.  Because the main character, Merida, wants to be free, she has a witch perform a spell to \\"change\\" her mother.  This \\"change\\" involved her turning into a horse.  The rest of the film consists of Merida trying to break the spell and bring her mother back into human form.  Okay, I can try to accept the odd storyline.  It is a kid's movie, after all.  But here's where I have a problem: The witch tells Merida to remember a phrase.  I don't remember it because everyone in the film has Scottish accents, so it was hard enough trying to comprehend what they were saying.  This phrase is supposed to be so important that the witch repeats it.  After this, we never hear the phrase again.  What was the point of spending that much screen time on something that won't be brought up again?  More organization in the script could've made this a better film.<br /><br />There was one thing I really liked about this film: the climax.  There is an awesome scene where we get to see two bears fight.  For a Disney film, it was actually really intense, which is an unusual but welcome feeling to experience in a film of this caliber.  This film was also funny, specifically when Merida is trying to sneak her bear mother past a group of townspeople.  Also, who doesn't enjoy seeing a bear dive down a big-breasted woman's blouse to get a key?  I give two thumbs up for the comedy in this film; the timing was spot-on and targeted several different age groups.<br /><br />To wrap things up, Braveis a colorful and funny film that lacks a solid script.  I really want to check out more Disney films in the future so I can keep in check my thoughts about the studio.  Disney usually does a good job of making great family films, but not always.  I liked Brave and I like the direction Disney is heading in.  If they continue to make films as enjoyable as this one, you can expect more Disney reviews from me.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|The free part is a joke.  Once the first level of about 5 games is done which takes about 2 minutes, you have to pay for the rest.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Within the first ten seconds of the film, we see female full frontal, so this film definitely had my interest. Side note, I seriously have no idea why half the audience gasped at this scene in the film. Read the freaking rating. Flight is rated R for a bunch of reasons, one of them being nudity. Nudity means private parts, like boobs and butts, and sometimes genitals, so don't be surprised when you see that in the movie. The film continues to follow the life of Whip Whitaker, pilot and alcoholic. Whip leads the fast life of drugs, booze, and sex, and it catches up to him when a routine flight goes wrong. This film focuses on his addiction to alcohol and how it destroys his life and those around him. I really liked the man vs. self theme in this film, as well as how Whip is his own worst enemy. Whip is the only thing holding himself back from moving on with his life and reconnecting with his ex wife and son. Some critics say this is Denzel's best film. I would argue there are much better films he has been in, but his performance here is still nothing short of fantastic, as always.<br /><br />I had a lot of issues with this film. A lot of the characters aren't likable (especially the lead) which makes it difficult to have any real moral compass in a film that lacks any moral center whatsoever. Plagued with lies, drinking to excess, and an almost abusive father figure, Whip is not a very likable character. Even his girlfriend gets annoying. I didn't like John Goodman either, even though it seemed like most of the audience did. My biggest issue with this film is one scene that features Whip's attorney and NTSD buddy helping him cover up that he's drunk by doing cocaine. This seemed extremely far fetched and silly, and it took away from the serious tone of the film.<br /><br />Flight takes off because of Denzel Washington's fine performance as an alcoholic and unrepentant liar, but doesn't quite level off because of some silly scenes that make what could've been a greatfilm a good one. Still, this is worth watching, especially if you are a big Denzel fan like I am. This is certainly not a bad film, but it's not really a great one either.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|it was a fun game and very easy to play in a good way. it makes me what to get more big fish games
B00AMBH70S|1.0|This movie went nowhere. The acting was good but the storyline and directing were horrible. For me, it was even worse as I loved the original three. Complete waste of time and money.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It seems that most of the funniest parts were included in the advertisements. If I would have been upset if I paid to see it in the movies. However it's worth the 1.99 to see it on Amazon.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game should have a sign that warns how addictive this game is. temple run is a true classic app. :)
B006YXTRHY|3.0|This movie was not made for my demographic, it's more for teens and  folks in their 20s. And I am not big on the whole romance thing. I do love vampire movies however. The movie did not have a lot of fighting scenes compared to the previous twilight movies. It more of less focused on the relationship between the two main characters and how when a vampire and a human do the wild thing, things can go badly.<br />With that said, for 1.99 it's worth a watch.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I bought this to double current processor and max out my mobo. This in conjunction with a bunch of RAM has really made a speed difference!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I put off reading these books because they exploded in popularity just like the Twilight books (which I can't stand to read), but now I've read the first two in the trilogy in two days and I'm perfectly fine with tossing another $7 to Suzanne Collins to complete the trilogy. Great books, well written.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Excellent hidden object game.  Great storyline with good graphics.  I would highly recommend.  Worked great on my kindle fire hd.
0547884591|5.0|So far this has been a good read. I suggest this book to anyone interested in cooking OR accelerated learning.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|This is a great action/thriller - nothing deep or profound - just good entertainment. It also had a less than predictable ending which is always nice. I'm not a fan of Travolta or Del Toro, fortunately they played bastards so it was appropriate to hate them.
B002X02V02|5.0|I'm a secret Gaga Fan.  I'm a 42 year old mother of 2.  My kids would probably die laughing if they knew I was such a big Lady Gaga fan, but I am.  I'm a huge fan.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|Bought this as a gift for my mom, she loved the series when it was originally on TV.<br /><br />This is the complete series and includes the movies.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use google all the time on my computer. now that it's on the kindle its equally as good.I love it way better then the stupid web searches. its very clean and easy.
0316069434|4.0|Another well-written story by Michael Connelly on Harry Bosch. This one is unique, told from the view of a long forgotten cold case. Connelly uses lots of imagination to bring this tale to its exciting conclusion. The presence at the end of one of the book's more minor characters is a real head scratcher though. I just can't imagine that anything like that would have ever happened in any real life situation. It's the province of the author, but he did lose a point with me by doing it.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This film, lacks the cerebral and intellectual content of the other Bourne films. It seems focused on car chases and explosions, without the substance. The premise is fantastic, but I would have liked to know more about the experiments and also more of the inside CIA operation. Edward Norton is good, and Jeremy does fine although he is no Jason Bourne.<br />If I had known this was just another mindless action flick, I would not have wasted my time.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|SPOILERS!  DO NOT READ PAST THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE DISAPPOINTED.<br /><br />I watched Downton Abbey season 3 online and no I am not lying.  Two main characters died!  One of them I was okay with, the other I was sooo disappointed.  The show will not be the same without the other main character.  I was disappointed for a whole week because of it.  Please brace yourself for this season.  I would say it is my least favorite with the second season being my favorite!  I'm sure you all heard that the man playing Matthew Crawley is leaving the show *HINT HINT* so that will give you a hint as to one of the characters who dies!<br /><br />Still the season is good and definitely worth a watch.  I just hope season 4 is better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow....cliff hanger...edge of the seat read. Everyone was right about this book...it is unbelievable... Going to the next book...now! Review to come again...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|You start of with 10 games and enough coins to buy 2 more. Getting coins is easy by just playing the games a few times. They'll all be unlocked in no time. It's so easy! Great entertainment. People gave it 1 star complain about only 10 games that is clearly stated in the description. GREAT APP.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|fun and exciting game. great value for your money. this is my first game from g5 and wont be my last.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|The acting in this movie is wonderful and the casting was perfectly done. The premiss behind the film is a great long time debate and wonderfully thought provoking. A must see again and again!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Very happy with my impulse buy.  This was a nice way for the extended family, adults and children, to spend holiday evenings together.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I thought his &#34;Home&#34; single was good (albeit overplayed on the radio), but I hadn't heard any of his other songs.  I listened to the 90 second clips (on iTunes) on a whim, not expecting to completely fall in love with this album like I did!!  I ordinarily avoid music that results from a stint on American Idol, which often sounds manufactured, predictable, and generally fleeting.  Phillip Phillips' sound is unexpectedly and deeply mature, particularly given that this is his first full-length album.  Rather reminiscent of Dave Matthew's sound, of whom I am not a fan, but he definitely holds his own in a side-by-side comparison.<br /><br />Listen to the clips on iTunes, the longer length will obviously be a much better indicator of whether you like the songs.  If you're on the fence, just buy it already :)
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I love SoundCloud.  For the music I listen to (which is mostly electronic in some form or another), this give me access to more artists who either don't podcast or use SoundCloud for another distribution channel to fans.  I like that I can download tracks or stream them.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the movie to come out :)
1594487154|5.0|I got an advance copy of the book from the publisher.<br /><br />I was a little scared to read the book at first - salesmanship is not a strong suit of mine. In fact, it sounds slimy to me. But Pink does a good job of explaining why we need to update the \\"definition\\" of a salesman and the connotations that come along with the notion. With the advent of the Internet and social media, it levels the information playing field between buyer and seller. We are all out for ourselves at this point. It's a good thing, but we also need a little help figuring out how to sell ourselves and our ideas.<br /><br />I really enjoy reading books that don't completely fit in a genre; this book is like that for me: part social science, part self-help. Good for marketers, business managers but also individuals interested in advancing themselves or even just communicating more effectively with others.<br /><br />Part two is great in that it presents the latest research in the social sciences in regards to what makes for a good salesman. There was a lot of counter-intuitive info in there! I'm quite an introvert - aren't most readers? - but I'm also in the arts, so I need to more effectively market myself and my work. I learned that ambiverts are actually the best salespeople - had never heard that term before - and there are other techniques Pink lays out that enable potential salesmen to identify with their \\"buyers.\\"<br /><br />It was a pretty fast, entertaining read. Not unlike stuff by Seth Godin, Hugh MacLeod.<br /><br />I think the biggest takeaway for me was that it took away some of the stigma around \\"sales.\\" Selling can be an art, and it can also be of social benefit to all, beautiful, etc. Re-framing it makes it much less scary. I've found that I've gotten bolder in terms of marketing myself and my work.
B001EJY8RW|4.0|This movie is an older movie, but it's still good.  I've seen it a number of times and still wish the ending was different, but a good watch.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Beautiful and emotional. Life through a dog's eyes and his emotions. Worth the read and money spent. I highly recommended.
B00197U13Y|5.0|This is a classic record by a group of some of my favorite artists. Thoroughly enjoyable album.<br />The vinyl itself is red and black, the heavy 180 gram stuff. Sounds pretty good on my system.  The Gatefold sleeve opens up to reveal a ouija board. There is an additional bonus track Mr Muggs (ambient field recording) on a smaller record in the shape of a planchette. I am a sucker for clever packaging.<br />Very happy with my purchase.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|In typical Clancy fashion, he has outdone himself again. It took a little while to set up the plot, but then it took off like a rocket. It was sad to see some characters die, but it made the book more realistic. I lost a lot of sleep because I couldn't stop reading. It was worth it!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Ben is a great interactive app!! He reads a paper and will burp three different ways whenever u want him too. it's fun to make him talk on the phone . Ben is very realistic and will repeat anything you say. Fun app that will leave you smiling!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie before reading the book and had this nagging feeling that something was missing. There was no stopping once I started and  three days later I am happy to report that Susan Collins is a genius! She has a way of pulling you in to each of her characters.  She revealed things and tugged at emotions a movie never couod. I am so excited to start on  the next book in  the trilogy!
B0053TMP24|5.0|It's an awesome story with twists you will never expect. It a great adventure story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. With just a little sprinkle of romance this action packed story is one of many great story's that Rick Riordan has shared with us. It is truly amazing.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|I wasn't laughing out loud too much.  Expected it to be funnier. Story line was ok. Four more words to complete survey.

B004ADH1RI|3.0|I've seen several films shot in Astoria, Oregon, since this one, and yet whenever I go there, I never find the picturesque qualities seen in the films!<br /><br />I had not seen &#34;The Goonies&#34; since it came out, and had confused it---due to the title, with some other film. (&#34;Gremlins&#34;, maybe?).  I'd think of it from time to time, and thus it stayed fresh in my mind; so imagine my &#34;shock&#34; to realize how old it was.  I mean, Dated.  Like a Shirley Temple film.  &#34;You Are Here&#34; says the galaxy map of time and space, and it's 1985.  That isn't necessarily a good thing, unless you like the 'eighties, and a lot of people do---as States Evidence I point to the fact that this film has its own website fan group.<br /><br />For the Record, this Astoria, in Oregon, is on the West Coast.  The movie starts off rather shakily with manic over-acting on the part of the kids, with half of them playing adult, Jersey Shore roles.  The girls in particular, when they show up, are right out of Big Hair East Coast 'Eighties (watch &#34;Moonstruck&#34;) something I never saw when I was passing through this area, regularly, in the day.  But Hollywood has deep Astoria, NY connections so I understand.<br /><br />In any case, within 30 minutes or so, the cast settles down and the story takes off.  From this point on, it's a pretty entertaining film.  Of course, times have changed and today the film seems like the basis for a Disneyland theme ride that never was, probably thanks to the &#34;Raiders...&#34; movies that produced one that is.  But the sets, especially inside the cliff, are quite imaginative and visually appealing.  The bad guys are bad enough, but still funny.  I don't think it's a spoiler to say it has a happy ending----only a clod couldn't figure that out.  But it was the very-very ending that I didn't like when I saw it, and saying what that was would be a spoiler, and probably why I never saw it again---the very last part could have been done better.<br /><br />Given that this is a Family Film, we have to note the abundant foul language.  By this point, Spielberg had come to be seen as the Modern Disney, producing saccharine sweet stories heavily tinted with nostalgia, and to protect himself from associations with the post-Walt, Disney crap that Eisner was just beginning to wrench that studio out of, Spielberg decided to use foul language and sexual references by kids to give a realistic edge.  A stupid and utterly unnecessary decision, especially given the lens of time.<br /><br />What's amusing is the Product Placement, which was just taking off---along with Corporate Naming, having been ushered in by the 1984 Olympics, Los Angeles--which made them profitable for the first time in decades, but left us with a legacy of baseball parks and theaters named for Corporations.  Here it's fairly tame, a couple of Pepsi cans and a Pizza Hut box too obviously &#34;placed&#34; in the frame.<br /><br />Some folks can't leave their youth behind---you see them at state fairs dancing to 1970s Disco hits with their kids, mindless of the often blatant sexual references;  those folks book DIsney cruises to Disney Parks and Disney Islands, and join &#34;The Goonies&#34; and &#34;The Christmas Story&#34; fan clubs.  Good for them.  It is not a disease, it certainly isn't contageous.  You can watch this film without catching it.  And, if the kids you know keep insisting you watch one of their miserable cartoons or films that you've seen over and over again, this might be old enough that they aren't aware of it, which would allow you to watch something with them that they will probably enjoy, without having to fear cramps and muscle aches from ninety minutes in permanent cringe mode.<br /><br />Go for it!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy books for me have always been about a great story, realistic characters and how much I learn from each of his books.  Threat Vector is no exception and is a book almost anyone can identify with in today's economy and technology driven society.  The worst part of this book, (like all Tom Clancy novels) is when you get to the end.  You will pick up this book and if you read it on your Kindle device, will wish it did not indicated that your were 90% done!
030758836X|2.0|Beginning of book was kind of exciting, then when the plot reveals, ugh just wanted to get through it. I thought it would be different- the characters were insufferable. Sorry!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Read Eye of the Needle years ago, have always considered it the best spy story I have ever read.  Downloaded to my Kindle<br />and re-read.  My opinion has not changed.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater on opening day (I'll admit, I went for Matt Bomer) and I expected to see a movie with very little plot. Surprisingly, it had plot and while somewhat of a rehashed one (really, what movie isn't) it was executed in a slightly different way. If you are familiar with Soderbergh then you will definitely know it is his movie from lighting to camera angles, but it was certainly enjoyable, even if you weren't going for the cute guys.<br /><br />For the DVD itself, I'm not a fan of the Blu-ray+DVD combo pack, but that seems to be the way of things recently, I would have prefered the Blu-ray and digital copy only. Also, on the bonus features, not all of the dance sequences are included on the extended dances(only one dance per guy while they clearly had more in the movie) and you can not skip between each guy. Each track as two guys dances.

B0081SPK0I|5.0|Final freeway 2R is a fun game where you are racing down the street to try and get to the end first and meanwhile trying to beat your opponent to be he to pass through the checkpoints .
B008IJT0CE|5.0|i love this app.  it has become a part of my nighttime routine.  there are many sounds to choose from although i tend to use my favorites.  i also enjoy the custom timer for auto shutoff.  the only thing i would like to add would be the ability to download a favorite to my ipod, which due to copyrights they can not offer.  the customer service was also quick to respond to my two inquiries.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad piggies free is one of the best games for free and the game is where you build contraptions for the bad piggies to run and collect items to help the piggies to try and steal the birds eggs.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I was introduced to this show after season 1 was on DVD a few years ago. I received season 1 as a birthday present and I have loved the show ever since. Season 3 was no different. The characters are still up to their hilarious shenanigans and evolving as the show continues. With all the Emmies and nominations this show is definitely one of the best on television and I hope it continues for quite a few more seasons.    I'm a bit of a weird-o and I don't like to watch television shows while they are being broadcast, I have a tendency to wait for the show to be released on DVD and then have a binge extravaganza. I enjoy this show so much I attempted to watch the first few episodes of this season on Hulu, but my crappy bandwidth didn't allow that to happen for long.    \\"Leap Day\\" is by far my favorite episode of this season. It is Cameron's birthday and he is turning 10, or is he turning 40? Phil likes to do something awesome with the extra 24 hours he is presented with on Leap Day and this year the family is going to take trapeze lessons. But we are presented with a rather hilarious plot twist, all of the girls in the Dunphy house are getting their periods--many laugh out loud moments came from this.    \\"Disneyland\\" is a humorous episode filled with poignant moments of the family that is reminiscing and creating new memories in this famous amusement park. I really enjoy the moment Jay has towards the end with his family, almost brought tears to my eyes.    My favorite family dynamic is Jay, Gloria and Manny. They have some of the most heart warming moments for me. This season is no different as Jay and Manny's relationship grows even more.    Phil and Cameron are definitely the funniest characters to me. They are both free spirited and kind people and the actors playing them are so animated and free in their portrayal of the characters.    This season has some great guest appearances my favorite being Leslie Mann as a woman Cameron picks up \\"as a straight man\\" and David Cross as a mouthy politician.    All in all this show is great. Season 3 did not disappoint at all. With a great cast and wonderful writing I can see this show continuing for quite some time. I can't wait to see what is happening in Season 4.    For more movie and television reviews check out my blog:  [...]
B003U6BE8I|5.0|For some reason I have watched this over and over on cable TV.  Thought I better have a copy. The sound track is awesome.
B005C0DHEY|4.0|Well done documentary. As someone who lived out west and is also a toxicologist we should be very careful about this technology. There is less and less potable water in the world. Unregulated emissions from these drill sites needs to be controlled.<br /><br />We need energy but we also need to look at the risks in some of these activities. There are hundreds of places that were contaminated by various industries. Besides Dick Cheney is evil incarnate
B008SBY7JI|1.0|i't didn't work out,I guess the person in shipping should have a picture of what's supposed to be in the box in front of them.I'm<br />busy, so I accept the mistake and go on down the road.I try to remember not to order from these people again
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Spectacular, splendid, superb - great acting, great plot, a 10/10. Riveting to the very end - of season 2.  Waiting for season 3.
B0063GORYU|4.0|great free app. could use an undo button. but it was free so who's complaining? Get this app. you will love it!
B005MLW8DO|1.0|Many better kids movies to watch instead.  Some parts of the movie not appropriate for children IMO. Overall one of the worst animated movies I've seen.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|It was a wonderful ending to a great series; and they left an opening for continuing the series on a whole different level.  I loved it.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Jack Nicholson was brilliant in this movie! I absolutely would recommend people to watch this movie! HERE'S JOHNNY & RED RUM!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved the writing, unexpected dialogue, character development and plot of this book. I cried for the whole last half, but somehow the book made me feel really good. I've never had cancer, nor been close to a young person who did (knock on wood), but somehow I felt that these characters represented what it was like--their relationships amongst each other, humor, (sometimes dark) sarcasm and ability to accept the reality of their situation and the fleetingness of life. It made me feel so grateful for my 30 years.
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|This is another generic Tom Cruise action film. Its no better or worse than most of them. But anyone who goes familiar with the Jack Reacher character or the books is going to be seriously disappointed.<br /><br />Tom Cruise just is not right for the role of Jack Reacher. Reacher has to be physically intimidating and Cruise just is not. Thats nothing against him because its actually difficult to think of any current big-name actor who could credibly play Reacher.<br /><br />Christopher McQuarrie was an odd and risky choice for writer/director. He didn't seem to do badly, but his presence made the whole thing feel a whole lot like an extra mission impossible.<br /><br />It gets one star because I don't like bait (Reacher) and switch (mission impossible 4.5).<br /><br />The best thing in the film is (inexplicably) Werner Herzog.

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is great I love it! You draw a stick man and draw him or her a friend but then something goes wrong and you have to go on a huge adventure while collecting storybook pages along the way to save your stick mans freind. :D ... royalty worth buying! but I wish I would have gotten it as the faotd... still good though...
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Totally does not work.  Don't even bother!!  After 5 or 6 posts everthing shows up on blue and there are no pics.

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Hey guys. This is Avery creative game where you have to draw things to get through the story. The worlds are free-roam and large, with multiple ways to exit the level and reach the boss level. Collect the papers and puzzle pieces to unlock virtual prides. MOST IMPORTANT PART HERE:When you finish this game, take time to play the computer version(Which in my opinion is a lot better) at drawastickman.com. You can even get your stickman on a t-shirt there.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This was a good movie up until the highly Hollywood end.  The acting was good, the story line made sense.  I laughed, I sympathised.  I was rooting for them all the way.  But no one changes a marriage in a week. I would have been happy with the hope that these people were on their way to figuring it out.  I really didn't need the perfect ending, which just undermined the credibility of the whole movie.  And the scene during the credits was plain embarassing. This movie was aimed at adults. We really don't need to be clobbered over the head- we get it- it worked out!  All that said, the movie is worth seeing.  It addresses real issues with humor and heart.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|The product looks cheap and its completely made of plastic but its from doctor who. Who wouldn't love it!? :D
B00701L6AK|5.0|Just what my daughter wanted for Christmas! Perfect! Saved me a lot of money getting the whole set. If you buy the contents individually, it would cost way more.

0547848412|5.0|I was interested in reading Life of Pi because it's about religion. I guess I'm what you call an ambivalent Christian. Religion is the monster in my closet, and God the monster hiding under my bed. I'm 17. I'm old enough; it was time to face my fears and, in the most blatant terms, grow the hell up.<br />And I did.<br />I watched Pi grow and I grew myself. One thing I love about Pi is his name; Pi is short for Piscine. Pi, the never-ending number. Pi, the answer to the universe. Pi, where rational meets irrational. Math is supposed to be concrete, factual, lucid, rational- but isn't pi an irrational number? Life of Pi is a book where the rational and irrational- hard survival and spiritual suffering- collide. Stranded on a lifeboat with only a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker as company, Pi must face off against the elements all while under God's interminable, blue and sunny ear. I think what Yann Martel, the author of Life of Pi, meant with his fantastical tale is that life, with all its reasons and numbers, cannot exist without the fantastic. The way we perceive the world, the way we understand its cold corners and hard facts, is beyond intellectual comprehension. It involves words such as aesthetic, intangibility, and even spirituality. God as a Man- it's really all starting to come together for me, now. But back to the story.<br />Martel is constantly blending colors that clash: A majestic tiger given the mundane human title of Richard Parker. A deeply religious boy named for a math term. Zoology and religious studies as a double major. An atheist professor and an Islamic imam both named Mr. Kumar. Three religious officials from three different religions on the same road, in the same conversation, in the same boy's heart and soul. Pi is a professed Christian, Hindu, and Muslim. And what better to be, because who is God? He is the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, Allah, Yahweh, Krishna, Shakti, Buddha. The Christian faith provides three name for God, but thereare thousands. Water, sky, grass, dirt, butterfly, tiger, stone, cloud, me, you...<br />In short, it's a brilliant novel. I absolutely hate the critics' praise at the beginning, though. They completely undermine the religious context of the novel, when the novel is ALL ABOUT RELIGION. I don't know how you can read this book and skirt around God in your review. It really pissed me off. Life of Pi isn't a novel solely about imagination and nature, nor is it a stern treatise on pluralism. It isn't some silly propaganda for any one religion, and it certainly isn't a Robinson Crusoe or The Old Man and the Sea wannabe. It is, more than anything, a candid, heartfelt, and fantastic love letter to God.<br /><br />For me, the novel evoked a few lines from Walt Whitman's \\"Song of Myself 48,\\" so I wanted to conclude with them:<br /> Why should I wish to see God better than this day?<br /> I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each<br />  moment then,<br /> In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in<br />  the glass;<br /> I find letters from God dropped in the street, and every one is<br />  signed by God's name,<br /> And I leave them where they are, for I know that others will punctually come forever and ever.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I think this is a great deal I mean you get to slaughter stuff for free<br />Also I the tutorial is simple and easy to follow

B008EQIEWS|3.0|This movie was not anything special, but it was not bad either.  If you liked the remake of CLASH of the Titans, then you will likely enjoy this one as well.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was great and I would recommend my cousin Isabella to read it because we have the same tast.  the diary of a wimpy kid seres are my favorite I've read all the books too.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I thought it was a good movie.  It was very much in the same vein as the original movies, I reccommend it for sure.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book will keep you guessing. It is well written and the characters are relatable. I love the love triangle aspect of the story.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|This is a great album.  It is perfect for relaxing or setting a mellow mood.  I highly recommend this album.
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|Definitely worth watching if you are in the mood for a fun action movie. It has some pretty interesting techniques and chase sequences. Be sure to keep track of the chronology of each scene, though.
1594487154|5.0|Once upon a time it was harder to figure out our world.  Every day, we used our own experiences and read books to make sense of things.  One day, Dan Pink started writing books that resonated.  These books included Free Agent Nation (describing a new way to work), A Whole New Mind (a new way to think), and Drive (a new way to motivate others).  Because of that, I began recommending and gifting Dan's books to many friends and acquaintances.  Because of that, I got my hands on a pre-release copy of Dan's latest book, To Sell is Human, which shows us how to do a better job selling, since we're all doing it anyway.  Until finally this insightful new book was released, and I can recommend it to you right here.  It will move you.  Enjoy!
B0032Y0OH0|5.0|When I first purchased this shuttle I only used it for FCP. But soon I found that started using it In every program. I even programmed it for use in photoshop. I find that I use it a ton surfing the web. I have a mouse with a scroll wheel but the shuttle makes it a lot easier.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|The on-screen chemistry between Richard Geer and Julia Roberts is outstanding.  The roles of Edward's lawer and the hotel manager were perfectly casted.  The plot is impressively realistic and the script well written.  I believe it to be one of the best moviies ever produced.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game and I play it as often as I can.  It's a very good brain game which I enjoy very much.
0525478817|4.0|Two young adults dealing with cancer meet, and support each other throughout their ordeal. Somewhat realistically told (certainly the horrors of treatment) but I found the characters' dialog somewhat unbelievable...a bit too sitcom for me, in parts.<br /><br />I did enjoy reading the book, but I enjoyed Green's previous books more than this, and am a bit surprised that this title is the one getting all of the attention.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I tried to play this game, but I lost interest and have not tried to play it again.  I will try it again!
B00914JWSW|5.0|These are songs recorded for different albums over the years that at the time were left on the cutting room floor.  That is not to imply they weren't good enough... simply, they didn't make the cut at the time.  It's vintage Streisand, and in particular, several songs that are chilling.  You either love her or hate her.  If you love her, you must have this album.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I requested this game for my grand and great kids.  It keeps them entertained and they enjoy it very much.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I could not get the map function to work without crashing the game. There were some really good puzzles. I would have liked to see more things to find or some hidden objects. Overall it was a solid game.
1419705849|5.0|I didn't read the book because it was a Christmas gift for my great grandson.  I have bought him every book since they have come out.  He looks forward to receiving these books.  I am just so happy that I can increase his book library and I am very happy that I can purchase these books from Amazon.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was different then the first book but I really enjoyed it and the twists and turns involved. It left you wanting more. I can't wait to read mockingjay next.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love Solitaire.  I play it every chance that I get.  It is my favorite game that I play on my Kindle Fire
B00007KWHG|5.0|This is a great collection. If you like this era of music, this is a fun album. It has the hits, and everyone seems to know at least one song!
B005HSL626|3.0|My grand children play it.  They seem to enjoy it.  I don't play it.  Keep it for the grand children.
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|I was surprised there were so many good reviews for this book when I just hated it so much. For one, I couldn't relate to any of the characters. Two, there were so many flaws in the writing that were hard to ignore. It is hard to enjoy a story when it is sloppily written. And the worst part; the melodrama.<br /><br />Alot of reviewers have said, \\"wow can you imagine loving someone that much\\". I guess that was the biggest hurdle for me because I couldn't imagine shooting someone I loved because they had a two month span of depression. It seemed very contrived to me. I also couldn't imagine parents high fiving each other when their thirteen year olds hooked up. Would two sets of parents think it was healthy for their children to date so young? Perhaps, but if so, these aren't people I can relate to.<br /><br />Then there was the gigantic, glaring obvious problem about exactly how many months apart were these two characters? I felt like I was on a roller coaster ride. First we read that Gus is already five months along, then we hear that they are rubbing their bellies and sharing all these intimate pregnancy moments even though Mel wouldn't be showing until Gus had already given birth. Then Gus is running through the hospitals with an infant carrier and later places the two babies together in the hospital bassinet. Can you imagine putting a five month old baby in a bassinet with a 1 hour old baby? Maybe for a photo op but to actually nap? Hard to believe. Then their actual birthdays are revealed and yes. they are more than five months old. At the end, in a court scene,  Em's father says they are 3 months apart. Ugh. It never ends. This mistake is weaved through the entire story.<br /><br />So all in all, a horrible read for me.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|There should be more \\"Downton Abbeys\\" in our TV/Movies nowadays!<br />From a Caribbean country (Dominican Republic), I felt lucky to have the chance to enjoy this production with my teenagers nieces and let them know about integrity, honor, love, romanticism, friendship, family, war, changes....LIFE!!

B009CPJHY4|4.0|It's a good story, and a good quality product.  There's no violence, lots of clever and funny bits, and a touch of poignance.
B009GEEMLY|1.0|Loved the movie - but the buffering and very poor screen quaility took away from the experience.  With state of the art  wireless elecronics and purchasing the HD version, it seemed more like I was watching a broken-down VHS recording.  Unitl Amazon can improve their band with issues, I would steer away from this service.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Great , the whole family likes to play Angry Birds and there are so many versions , keeps my grandsons occupied , they always ask to play it

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I've just read Beautiful Disaster 4 times non-stop.  Loved the characters - Abbie and Travis, America and Shep, and especially Finch !  I think I know it \\"chapter and verse\\" by now, but my guess is, I'll keep picking it up from time to time just to enjoy again.
B0086700CM|5.0|WOW ! this is a fun game to play , got to have good reaction time or you'll be finished in a heart beat , I think most would enjoy
1608871517|5.0|I have an extensive collection of books on MJ, and this one is at the top of the list right after \\"Dancing the Dream\\" and the \\"Opus\\".  In fact, it is a mini-opus itself.  This book is a treasure that every MJ fan MUST own.  The book itself is gorgeous and huge, with a stunning cover.  Each page is beautifully designed with photos and stories that grab and delight the reader.<br /><br />Already having tremendous respect and awe for Michael's musical genius, I am now equally awed by his fashion genius and all of the incredible time and thought that went into each piece.  His creativity seems bottomless and limitless.  He truly did push all boundaries, always wanting to lead and not follow, ever expanding and creating and inspiring those that were blessed to work with and for him.  Everything he did and everything he touched was inspired by his artistic genius.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Bush for sharing a huge piece of your heart and your cherished memories with us.  The stories of your time with Michael are priceless!!!  For the millions who love MJ but will never have the opportunity to know him in this life, these stories are much needed food for the soul.<br /><br />I will end by saying buy this book today!!  You will be thrilled with it.

B005HSL626|2.0|I'm disappointed and my girlfriend is disapointed, because now I'm back on her ipad rather than my Kindle Fire HD7 that she gave to me for Christmas to play this game. My Kindle Fire HD7 keeps freezing up during the game and at the end I don't get the pomegranate, it simply ends and adds up your score. Disappointing.

B00AA0TJO8|1.0|Free app of the day should be called free c$#% of the day!  Just terrible - stuck replaying the first \\"Rescue the Penguins\\" level over and over even after successfully completing the level.  \\"Select Level\\" (randomly) lets you move on to the next level, but at this point, I've lost interest in such a poorly programmed application.  Touch responsivity on the Kindle Fire is really poor.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Overall a great story of the effects of war and the destruction it causes to our youth.  Also, a wonderful portrayal of youth forced to love each other in order to stay alive.  A great book on the whole and a must read!!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I must admit I was a little hesitant about purchasing this album because of some reviews I had heard about it being all over the place and sporadic... Judge for yourself people! I would not call myself a die hard rhi rhi fan but these last couple of records have surprised me.  There is something there for the rock stars and something there for the lovers and the broken hearted.... Rhi rhi is a force to be reckoned with and I love he fact they she loves and is comfortable with who she is. This record is a keeper.... Great mood music
0525478817|5.0|Got this book for my girlfriend for xmas, she absolutely loved it and is recommending it to her friends.  Very happy with the condition it arrived in.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Nice to finally have the entire collection.  We've probably paid for it as much as we've rented the individual movies from the library over the years!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My niece asked for the Perplexus for Christmas, and she received both the original and the epic versions.  The Perplexus Epic, for first time players, might be a bit frustrating without familiarity with technique or the type of ramp and device set ups.  I had tried this one first, as I was the one who got it for her, and did enjoy it, but couldn't get passed a certain spot consistently.  The original Perplexus version has three places to start in the maze.  For example, if you get to the 27th spot, you can start there if the ball falls.  After solving the original one, the Perplexus Epic was more enjoyable, while still remaining challenging.  Both turned out to be very fun!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|On this game, you can draw your own fun characters and guide them through easy -challenging adventures. Today, I got it for free, but I probably would have gotten it at the regular price, $1.99.It's a fun game and I definitely recommend it to anyone!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I bought this watch as a Christmas present for my husband and so far he loves it. The strap being canvas is nice so that it neither pinches the hair on his arm as a metal links might nor does it get sweaty or tear as rubberized ones often do. The back of the watch is covered in some kind of glass so he can see the gears on the inside as they work, which I didn't realize upon purchasing but he discovered immediately and was thrilled. The watch is quiet, keeps good time, readable in the dark and overall a nice piece. Can't beat the price
1575666286|5.0|Loads of information and even includes a sample daily meal menu.  Yes, this therapy does recommend coffee enemas...but if you're struggling with cancer or other ailments, you're willing to try anything.  Very detailed and highly informative.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|I know a lot of people loved this book, and that is great.  For me it was unrealistic.  Having been the caretaker of someone young who is mortally ill, this missed the mark.  I am aware that different people have different experiences, but this just felt superficial to me.

B00AHSMDQY|5.0|If you want a great escape action movie this movie is up to the task.  I was engrossed in the film from start to finish.  It was very well acted with a great cast of characters including the villain.  Christian Bale is top notch!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Anyone that hasn't read Colleen Hoover's books needs to do so... NOW!! They are worth every penny and more!! This book was beautifully written with poise and a grace that only Colleen Hoover possesses!! Buy it, you will NOT be disappointed!
159514188X|5.0|Thirteen reasons why is a dead girl's revenge against the one's who've harmed her.<br />It's also a poignant reminder of a crisis that could have been averted had the students and teachers listened a little bit more to Hannah Baker's cry for help. I read every word of this spellbinding book in one day.<br /><br />I firmly believe this book should be a mandatory read in all high schools and for every guidance counselor or teacher.<br /><br />The tale is told through the tapes of Hannah Baker. These are tapes she made prior to her suicide. Clay Jensen listens to the tapes as he follows the map she's made. He suddenly sees people and places through Hannah's eyes. It makes you see how small lies can have the biggest snowfall effect.<br /><br />I had goosebumps while reading this book. Also, as a former victim of bullying, I felt somewhat vindicated that Hannah was able to get back at her oppressors. This book really hit home for me.<br /><br />Read this book and let's talk about it afterwards.<br /><br />ps: you should check out the tapes on You Tube: youtube.com/hannahsfriend13
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Enjoyed every second of reading this incredible love story! Never in my life have i felt such a deep connection with this incredible novel. Highly recommended!!!!!!!!
B0053O8AQE|5.0|Only would be better if it was a REGION 2 DVD as for South Africa! Next to that we absolutely love it.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I love Pink.  Simple as that.  You can't compare her to other &#34;commercial successes&#34; who, in my opinion, are posers.  You know who I mean.  Pink is what she is and if you don't like it, you can leave.  She writes explicit lyrics because she is an explicit person.  Real and raw in a sea of phonies.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was a little weary when I picked it out but it literally had me from page one as I was frantically awaiting the next thing to happen I couldn't stop turning the page.  It's seriously addictive and I can't wait to start the second one....right now
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I'm giving up on Stephen King.  I got halfway through this monster (and I don't mean that in a good way) before I realized I was only halfway through this meandering waste of time.  I don't think he's really trying anymore.  The whole &#34;time travel paradox&#34; thing has been done to death.  His characters are starting to recycle with greater frequency.  Give me the Stephen King that wrote The Shining, The Stand, Misery.  Maybe he could go back in time and save him from himself.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I bought this for my wife's Kindle Fire. She loved it. It looks good and fits good. (Not a bad price either)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was not what i expected. Ana was way to juvinel for her age, which made her seem rather silly, not sure silly is the right word. But like i said i think i'm way to old for this subject. I think i would have liked the story had Ana been a little more up to date with the women of today..
B0098VXBIA|4.0|I caught bits and pieces of this movie while I was traveling but wasn't able to view it completely because I had to check out of the hotel. As soon as I got home I rented it and viewed it with my wife. We both enjoyed the movie and thought that it was very funny.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game it's fun it passes the time plus it's a game where you have to extend your territory before you can build buildings there and you have to earn money before you can buy anything.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Definitely not for the kids.  Great raunchy flick with many unexpected moments. Definitely recommending this funny adult movie to friends.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Great movie, purchased for a gift and the person was thrilled to receive as it is impossible to find anywhere to rent.
B008QDCZ7E|5.0|highly recommended. Increasingly fan of Norah Jones. The SACD sound quality is excellent. Great buy for any fan of jazz
B007704HO6|4.0|I have read many better written books, but what this book has in bucket loads is like-ability. It gives the reader real insight into life on the streets and I have to admit it changed my attitude to the sale of Big Issue. This is a heartwarming tale of the companionship that can develop between people and animals.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game really is epic! It seems easy at first but it gets harder and harder. Some levels are challenging for me, but some I didn't find that difficult. Get this app NOW
B001UV4XIS|5.0|the movie was here quicker than expected. it is a really great movie and i would recommend to any one.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is an awesome game that is really addicting! You get to go through Jetpack courses to earn coins that you use to buy new gear. I am awesome at this game and you'll catch on easily, too. I really recommend this game!

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Get this game. It is EPIC! You get to breed and raise all kinds of hybrid and rare dragons in your own custom designed habitat/park. You earn coins to purchase decorations, dragons, food, and habitats. If you want to you can use real money to buy gems, food, and coins. This game is a MUST HAVE GAME.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|haha i love brendan in this movie, and everything about him.. well i actually like all of his movies :D
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|While reading this book I had no idea where it was going. Imagined the worst because of the opening chapter. This book, however, draws you and consumes you till you are finally finished. I would recommend a 5 star for this book but after the climax there was a lot of repeating as well as, I believed there to be, unnecessary text in about the last 15% of the book.<br />Overall this book was a wonderful read. The author talks about such a touchy subject so well. My heart goes out to all the families that have dealt with these conflicts within the book.<br />Great book.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I just love the whole series, i can watch it all the time, i still laugh and cry every time! excellent choice to buy =D
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie was a great buy instores it cost at least twentry-one dollars I would definely recommend this one to friends.
0547564651|5.0|GRIT AND CHARACTER: CHILDREN SUCCEED WHO HAVE IT; THOSE WHO DON'T WON'T<br /><br />I. GED DEGREES ARE WORTHLESS. IQ or intelligence, by itself, has little to do with a child's ultimate success. America once believed the contrary: that what schools develop, and what a high school degree certifies, is cognitive skill.  Thus, if a teenager has proven this skill through passing the GED exam, then she doesn't have to waste her time actually finishing high school. We now know this is false.  In terms of all kinds of important future outcomes - annual income, unemployment rate, divorce rate, use of illegal drugs and college accomplishments - GED holders look exactly like every other high school drop-out. Yes, the GED measures intelligence. But it signifies nothing more.<br />II. THE ACQUISITION OF NON-COGNITIVE SKILLS SUCH AS GRIT, CURIOSITY AND CONSCIENTIOUSNESS. These are what economists refer to as noncognitive skills, that psychologists call personality traits and that the rest of us sometimes think of as character. Developing many other kinds of skill - such as in vocabulary and math - is a simple matter of starting earlier and practicing more. If you want to perfect your foul shot, shooting 200 free throws every afternoon is going to be more helpful than shooting 20. If you're in fourth grade, reading 40 books over the summer is going to improve your reading ability more than 4. But we can't get better at overcoming disappointment by working harder at it; children don't lag behind in curiosity simply because they didn't start doing curiosity drills at an early enough age.<br />III. PERRY PRESCHOOL PROJECT. In this 1960s war on poverty experiment, children 4 years of age were selected from low-income, low IQ, inner-city black parents and then immersed in a high quality two-year pre-school program. The Perry Project for a long time was considered something of a failure because by the time the children were in the third grade, their IQ scores had deflated and were no better than a control group's.  However, years later,  an economist looking at the Perry data discovered that there had been very positive effects. Compared to the control group, the Perry children were more likely to have graduated from high school, more likely to be employed at age 27 , and less likely ever to have been arrested or spent time on welfare.<br />IV. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES STUDY.  (Commonly called ACE) From a mostly middle class Kaiser HMO data base, researchers conducted surveys on thousands  of adults to determine whether they, as children, had experienced any of 10 different categories of adverse childhood experience: physical and sexual abuse, physical and emotional neglect, divorced or separated parents, parents incarcerated/ addicted, etc. A child who had suffered one of these conditions got an ACE score of \\"1\\", two conditions, \\"2\\" etc. The correlations between adverse childhood experiences and negative adult outcomes were so powerful that they \\"stunned\\" the researchers. People with ACE scores of 4 or higher were twice as likely to smoke, 7X more likely to be alcoholics, and 7X more likely to have had sex before age fifteen. They were twice as likely to have been diagnosed with cancer, twice as likely to have heart disease, twice as likely to have liver disease, four times as likely to suffer from emphysema or chronic bronchitis. On some charts, the slopes were especially steep: adults with an ACE score above 6 were 30X more likely to have attempted suicide than those with an ACE score of 0. And men with an ACE score above 5 were 46 more likely to have injected drugs. Even when researchers discounted for self-destructive behaviors like smoking and heavy drinking, the negative health effects on things such as heart disease were still pronounced. The key channel causing the damage: the body's hormonal reaction to the stress, precipitated by the childhood adversity. The effects were \\"written\\" on the child's body ... deep under their skin wherethey remained for the rest of its life.<br />V. EXECUTIVE FUNCTION (the ability to deal with confusing and unpredictable situations) Researchers long have known that poverty correlates strongly with executive function, but they didn't know why. When researchers used statistical techniques to factor out child adversity influences, the apparent poverty effect disappeared completely. It wasn't poverty itself that was messing with the executive-function abilities of poor kids. It was the stress that usually goes along with poverty.<br />VI. HIGH-LICKING AND GROOMED LAB RATS.  A researcher (Meaney) while handling baby rat pups, inadvertently noticed a difference between pups after they were put back in the litter: some were licked and groomed by their mothers while other mothers ignored their pups. Tests determined that human handling of pups always produced anxiety and a flood of stress hormones. Researchers divided the pups into two categories: high lick and groomed (LG) pups vs.  low (LG) pups.  Factoring out genetics (by putting pups with foster mothers) the differences in \\"character\\" between the two groups was striking. Over the full course of their lives, the high-LG pups excelled:  They were better at mazes. They were more social. They were more curious. They were less aggressive. They had more self-control. They were healthier. They lived longer.<br />VII. HUMAN CHILD DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH. Into the 1960s, research in this field was dominated by the \\"behaviorists.\\" Non-behaviorist researchers created the \\"Strange Situation\\" experiment:  12 month old human babies with their mothers were put into a lab set up as a playground. Then the mothers were asked to leave the lab, sometimes leaving the baby alone and sometimes with strangers. When the mother returned, researchers observed two different categories of baby reaction:  60% (\\"securely attached\\") greeted the returning mother happily, sometimes tearfully, sometimes with joy; 40% (\\"anxiously attached\\") did not havea happy reunion, lashing out, pretending to ignore the mother, etc. Not surprisingly in retrospect- since this was exactly the opposite of what the behaviorists had expected - the parents of the anxious babies had parenting styles that were detached or conflicted or hostile. This difference in early parental care had long-term consequences; the researchers discovered that this single measure of baby attachment could predict with 77% accuracy which children would never graduate from high school. A more accurate predictor than IQ or test scores or the natural abilities of the child!  Bottom line:  improving a child's attachment is the most powerful lever for improving later academic outcomes, far more important than infant nutrition, housing, the vocabulary richness of the home, etc.<br />VIII. KIPP CHARTER SCHOOLS (Knowledge is Power Program) These charter schools were started in New York City  for inner city kids and involved a new, immersive style of schooling, combining long days of high-energy, high-intensity classroom instruction with an elaborate program of attitude adjustment and behavior modification.  Initially, the formula seemed to have worked: in 1999 the KIPP students earned the highest scores of any school in the Bronx and the fifth-highest in all of New York City. Unheard of. But longer term, the results of PIPP were not so clear-cut.  Six years after their high-school graduation, just 21 percent of the KIPP initial class-- eight students-- had completed a four-year college degree. The problem:  KIPP set up graduating students very well academically, but it didn't prepare them emotionally or psychologically. \\"We went from having that close-knit family, where everyone knew what you were doing, to high school, where there's no one on you.\\"  What the founder of KIPP (Levin) learned was that what his students needed, in addition to academic skills, what he called \\"character strengths\\"... like optimism and resilience. The trouble was that at that time in America, there was not an established curriculum or method for teaching character.... or even talking about it!  Today, Levin's teachers use chants, songs and drills and the students wear T-shirts with the slogan \\"One School. One Mission. Two Skills. Academics and Character.\\" Upshot: Levin has learned that character traits such as optimism are learnable skills and that these character skills are even more necessary for the under-privileged.<br />IX. CHARACTER NEEDED EQUALLY BY CHILDREN OF THE WEALTHY. John F Kennedy and Robert F Kennedy once attended Riverdale School in New York City. Tuition in this school, just for prekindergarten, starts at $38,500 per year.  It is the kind of school members of the establishment send their kids so they can learn to be members of the establishment. Yet the new headmaster at Riverdale believes the emphasis on tests and IQ \\"is missing out on some serious parts of what it means to be a successful human.\\" That missing thing is character.  \\"People who have an easy time of things, who get eight hundreds on their SATs, I worry that those people get feedback that everything they're doing is great. And I think as a result, we are actually setting them up for long-term failure.\\" For underprivileged KIPP kids, the notion that character can help them get through college is a powerful lure, but for kids at schools like Riverdale, not so much. No Riverdale student ever doubts that he/she is going on to college and inevitable graduation. (`Every generation in my family did it'). So it's harder to get rich kids invested in this idea of character. Riverdale see a lot of \\"helicopter parents,\\" always hovering around, ready to swoop in to rescue, but not necessarily, to bond.<br />X. AFFLUENT TEENAGERS OFTEN HAVE MORE PROBLEMS WITH ALCOHOL, DRUGS AND DEPRESSION THAN LOW-INCOME TEENS. Studies show that children of affluent parents exhibit \\"unexpectedly high rates of emotional problems beginning in junior high school. And this is no accident of demographics. Wealthy parents today are more likely than others to be emotionally distant from their children while at the same time insisting on high levels of achievement, a potentially toxic blend of influences that can create \\"intense feelings of shame and hopelessness.\\" Some studies have found that affluent teenagers use alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and harder illegal drugs more than the low-income teens. And because of emotional disconnection, affluent parents tend to be unusually indulgent of their children's bad behavior. Children of affluent parents don't have to put up with a lot of suffering. They don't have a threshold for it and, thus, inadvertently they are shielded from exactly the kind of experiences that can lead to character growth. What kids need more than anything is a little hardship: some challenge, some deprivation that they can overcome, even if just to prove to themselves that they can.<br />XI. CONSCIENTIOUSNESS.  Human personality can be explored along 5 dimensions: agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience, and conscientiousness. The most important of these from the standpoint of academic success is conscientiousness, the ability to respond well even in the absence of material incentives. Conscientiousness predicts many outcomes that go far beyond the workplace. People high in conscientiousness get better grades in high school and college; they commit fewer crimes; and they stay married longer. They live longer-- and not just because they smoke and drink less. They have fewer strokes, lower blood pressure, and a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease. The people in society who value conscientiousness are not intellectuals, and they're not academics, and they're not liberals. They tend to be religious-right conservatives. Until very recently, academic researchers shunned conscientiousness; they preferred to study \\"openness to experience\\" because it's \\"cool\\" and it's about creativity. Most of the research on conscientiousness was done by consultants to resource managers in large corporations who found that IT was the trait that best predicted workplace success. But though it has no downsides, conscientiousness is not the only measure of human potentiality, nor the only word to encompass the concept.<br />XII. \\"GRIT\\" AND THE 6 OTHER STRENGTHS OF HUMAN PERSONALITY.  Grit is roughly defined as \\"a passionate commitment to a single mission and unswerving dedication to achieve that mission. A simple test (involving self-evaluation) has been developed and it is highly predictive of academic success. Grit is only faintly related to IQ; there are smart gritty people and some dumb gritty people. The educational authorities upon whom the author relies believe grit is the most important for education of the 7 dimensions of human character they have focused upon. Self-control, zest, social intelligence, gratitude, optimism and curiosity are the others.<br /><br />XIII. THE CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN `WANTING' SOMETHING AND `CHOOSING' IT. When it comes to ambition, there is a crucial difference between volition and motivation. Between wanting to lose weight and choosing to be fit. Decide that you want to become world chess champion, and you will probably fail to put in the necessary hard work. If, however, you choose to become world champion, then you will reveal your choice through your behavior and your determination. Every action says, `This is who I am.' The author spent several years monitoring a woman public school chess coach who has had amazing success teaching NYC underprivileged black kids to become (often) nationally ranked chess players. One such kid gave up everything for more than a year to achieve his goal: no parties, no Facebook, no TV or ESPN. Talking about it later, this young man looked back on those months with not just pride in the result, but also pleasant memories of that monastic process. He contrasted this period of dedication with his previous feeling of being unchallenged, \\"Wasting his brain.\\" Why not, he was asked, spend the same energy on something worthwhile like becoming a brain surgeon? Or something that will bring one material advantage?  He answered in terms of aesthetics. The game of chess \\"is a celebration of existential freedom, in the sense that we are blessed with the opportunity to create ourselves through our actions. In choosing to play chess, we are celebrating freedom above utility. The same can be said of football, competitive swimming, etc..<br />XIV. RULES, WILLPOWER, HABIT AND CHARACTER. Rules are not the same as willpower. They are a metacognitive substitute for willpower. By making yourself a rule (\\"I never eat fried dumplings\\"), you can sidestep the painful internal conflict between your desire and your willful determination to resist. Rules provide structure, preparing us for encounters with tempting stimuli and redirecting our attention elsewhere. Before long, the rules have become as automatic as the appetites they are deflecting. William James, the American philosopher and psychologist, wrote that the traits we call virtues are no more and no less than simple habits.  Habit and character are essentially the same thing. Some kids have good habits and some bad; the trick for schools is to inculcate - in most of them - the good.<br />XV. GROUP IDENTITY AND \\"STEREOTYPE THREAT.\\" The human psyche is incredibly complex. Psychologists have demonstrated that group identity can have a powerful effect on achievement-- both a positive and a negative one.  For example, poor disadvantaged kids going to KIPP charter schools are encouraged to play on the in-group/ out-group thing: `We know what SLANTing is and you don't know what SLANTing is, because you don't go to KIPP.' When white students at Princeton were told before trying a ten-hole mini golf course that it was a test of natural ability in sports (which they feared they didn't possess), they scored four strokes worse than a similar group of white students who were told it was a test of their ability to think strategically. For black students, the effect was the opposite: when they were told the mini golf course was a test of their strategic intelligence, their scores were four strokes worse. Before a challenging math test, female college students need only be reminded that they are female for them to do worse on the test than female students who don't receive that identity cue. The good news about stereotype threat is that, just as it can be triggered by subtle cues, it can be defused by subtle interventions.<br /><br />XVI. YOUNG ADULTS WITHOUT CHARACTER SKILLS DON'T HAVE MUCH ....BECAUSE CHARACTER IS WHAT KEEPS PEOPLE HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL AND FULFILLED. Chess or athletics or an \\"A\\" in calculus, anything that one choses to accomplish, it doesn't matter. Per the author:  \\"I think the worst thing is you look back on your childhood and it's one blur of sitting in class and being bored and coming home and watching TV.\\" This is the all too common result for too many American children.  In positive psychology \\"optimal experiences\\" are those rare moments in human existence when a person feels free of mundane distractions, in control of his fate, totally engaged by the moment. A word to describe this is flow. Flow moments occur \\"when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult or worthwhile.\\" \\"There's joyousness to it. That's when you're happiest or that's when you're most you or that's when you feel your best. It's easy for naysayers - looking from the outside in - to deride your accomplishment; but for the child who has achieved, there's nothing else they'd rather do.<br /><br />XVII. CONCLUSION:  WE NEED TO IMPROVE POOR CHILDREN'S ACADEMIC SKILLS AND OUTCOMES.  Academic grades in school are very good predictors of all kinds of outcomes in life: not just how far you'll go in school and how much you'll earn when you get out, but also whether you'll commit crimes, whether you'll take drugs, whether you'll get married, and whether you'll get divorced. What The Bell Curve showed was that kids who do well in school tend to do well in life, whether or not they come from poverty. If we can help poor children improve their academic skills and academic outcomes, they can escape the cycle of poverty by virtue of their own abilities and without additional handouts or set-asides. But....according to a consensus of reform advocates, the challenge is that there are far too many underperforming teachers, especially in high-poverty schools.<br /><br />.
0312944926|4.0|I didn't care about the accuracy of the computer jargon as some other readers have complained about. I'm not a computer techie so it really didn't matter to me. The story was fast paced and hard to put down. It was similar in concept to 2012 Airborne Prophesy that focused on wave technology rather than computer based. Both had a strong love interest and both went back and forth on perspective of who was front and center for the chapter. I would recommend it to anyone who is not critical of the accuracy of details and just wants a fun read.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I can't draw, so this is the perfect game for me. My friends and I have a lot of fun playing, as we all draw badly. The pictures we have to draw are easy, so that's what makes this game fun. I have it on my Kindle Fire and it works just fine. Actually, it works better than anything else on my Kindle, because it doesn't time-out like everything else. It will stay on the Draw Something screen until I do something. Makes it nice for when I'm waiting for the other person to play. I don't have to keep logging on to see if they have played yet. What I don't like about it though, it doesn't make a sound when the other person plays their turn. You just have to keep an eye on it and check back often. I think it's great.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great, great book. Highly recommend it. Very easy to read. Be prepared though, once you start you won't be able to stop!

B0041KVW2K|1.0|The boxset would be great except half of the albums are defective from pressing. Most are pressed so much off center that it is exhausting watching the needle trying to track the groove. This is most likely why there is distortion and drop-outs throughout playback. I am just returning mine. There are way too many bad reviews. This should be recalled and EMI should have a more reliable pressing plant get the job done right.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I must admit, I am biased towards this movie simply because of the video game references. I literally spazzed out when my friend showed me the trailer to Wreck It Ralph. So many video game characters!<br /><br />*Minor spoilers ahead*<br /><br />Young enough to have grown up with video games and old enough to remember the \\"classics\\" (like Tapper, Q*bert, and Duck Hunt - I'm too young to have played those, but I'm old enough to have played the newer variants before more advanced games came along), I found this movie nostalgically moving. The multitude of references and cameos bring back many good memories. I spazzed out again in the movie theatre, nearly spilling my soda, when King Candy started punching in the Konami Code. Anyone who's had a childhood will definitely recognise something from the movie, whether it be Chun Li, Space Invaders, or Sonic. Many other references are less subtle, such as Mario's mushroom and Metal Gear Solid's exclamation mark in Tapper's lost and found, or the graffiti of All Your Base Are Belong To Us and Leeroy in the entrance to Game Central Station (I love these internet references). References and cameos just keep coming, and the excitement that comes with the recognition of familiar characters wash over you wave after wave. (Donkey Kong and Mario Kart are indirectly referenced - Wreck It Ralph (the game) is modeled after DK and Sugar Rush after Mario Kart).<br /><br />The plot follows a beaten path, but its traversal of this beaten path sets it apart from other movies. Ralph's journey to finding, and then coming to terms with, himself has been seen in many other movies. However, when adorned with so many video games, the journey becomes extraordinary. Also, Wreck It Ralph, unlike other movies, focuses on the journey of a \\"villain,\\" the \\"bad guy.\\" When did a movie tell the story of the bad guy? Never until Wreck It Ralph! When playing video games, we usually don't give a thought to the bad guy, but this movie turns the \\"bad guy\\" intoa well-rounded and lovable character.<br /><br />Um. Epiphany. So. For the past 12 months, I had been struggling with my forever alone predicament. I just pined to be in a relationship, you know? Just as how Ralph pined for a medal, for him to be the good guy for once. But as Ralph hopped across games in search of a medal, he realised that it's ok that he's the \\"bad guy.\\" Being the \\"bad guy\\" doesn't make him any less of a video game character. He made friends and saved all of Sugar Rush. So yah, it's ok I'm alone. I got some pretty darn awesome friends and life is awesome. Seriously, when I walked out of the theatre, I was elated. Took me a while to realise why, but I'm totally cured of being heartsick.<br /><br />Wreck It Ralph not only entertained me, it also brought back good memories and CHANGED MY VIEW ON LIFE.<br /><br />BEST MOVIE I'V EVER SEEN.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Lovely story showing how people from different walks of life learn to relate to, and care about, each other. Makes you feel good to see people in their senior years rediscover who they are, be open to love again, and change their outlook on life. Visually, the sites and colors are also very entertaining.

B0027MJU00|3.0|I bought this book because I LOVED Gone Girl & Sharp Objects. This is my least favorite of the 3. I know just how ugly people can be and I do not enjoy being reminded. The family's bad luck is overwhelming and gets harder to digest while one begrudgingly realizes that one must see it through to the end. I didn't want to care as much as I did after all. Ms Flynn is a masterful writer with a formidable mind and a readiness to feel that's scary. Fans of Jodi Picoult will enjoy this book. I would also recommend this book to anyone who is quick to judge others, but those people - by definition - never really see themselves anyway. I can't wait to read everything else Gillian Flynn writes.

For all you people don't like the hunger games I can't make you like it but I can say that the second book is much better than the first one.

0670024813|4.0|In two previous books Jared Diamond has explored how a fortunate confluence of advantages allowed Europeans to be the ones who largely conquered the world ([[ASIN:0393061310 \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\"]]), and how societies can be driven to collapse either by over exploiting their environment or by climate change that is more rapid than they can adjust to ([[ASIN:0143117009 \\"Collapse\\"]]). Now he tackles how people lived (and in some pockets still live) before \\"civilization\\" as we know it today arose. Once again Diamond demonstrates broad knowledge and a capacity to draw features of multiple societies together into a better understanding of humans as a species.<br /><br />While I admire Diamond, some of his beliefs and conclusions are open to debate, and should not be taken uncritically. Anthropology is not an exact science, and reasonable, knowledgeable people can draw different conclusions from the same facts, with no way to test and prove one or another interpretation as correct. As I will explain, there are many arguments in this book I find compelling, but others where I think Diamond reaches too far. But anyone reading this book with an open mind will learn much about our species, and be challenged to consider a new way of looking at how people lived \\"until yesterday\\".<br /><br />As will be expected by readers with Diamond experience, a lot of the book happens in New Guinea, where Diamond has made many trips to study the birds (he is, among other things, an ornithologist) and has many friends. Those of us who have read his prior books recognize his affinity for the people of New Guinea. Despite some protests to the contrary, it is not hard to get the impression that Diamond really enjoys their company more than that of Americans and other westerners. At times he seems somewhat prejudiced toward their social structures, although he also appears to recognize this and tries to resist putting them on too high a pedestal. But we all have a view of the world that we can't completely escape, so it's not fair to criticize Diamond too harshly for being, well, human.<br /><br />The first interesting observation of the book is that until recently, and still in some areas, people rarely if ever encountered strangers. They encountered friends and they encountered enemies. But nearly everyone they encountered came from their group or a neighboring group, be that group friendly or hostile. Travelers were rare, and couldn't count on a warm welcome. In populated areas today we pass strangers every day and think nothing of it. We walk into shops and think nothing of exchanging pleasantries with people we've never met before. We travel long distances, and expect to be welcomed upon arrival. None of this happened a few thousand years ago.<br /><br />Before the dawn of agriculture there were no large scale societies, because no land could support a dense population. There were also no governments, no police forces, no courts, and no armies. People worked out their differences, or they killed each other. When a bad interaction happened, intentionally or accidentally, a customary gesture of restoration might defuse the situation. Or a cycle of tit-for-tat killings might begin, and might continue for generations.<br /><br />In a modern states wars occur only intermittently and, horrible as they can be, have a limited death toll. Hunter gatherer societies were often trapped in a cycle of violence and warfare with neighboring groups vying for the same resources. They often employed true total warfare, all against all, with the losers exterminated and their land appropriated. (The women might be taken as wives. The men died in the fight and the children were killed.)<br /><br />The details vary from region to region, and Diamond provides a variety of examples. But when small groups of people have to eke out subsistence from a reluctant environment, neighboring groups can be as much an enemy as carnivores and drought. He also notes the similarity to chimpanzee behavior--the seeds have not fallen so far from the tree. By one calculation chimpanzee death rates due to warfare are similar to those in hunter gatherer societies! (Another Diamond book is [[ASIN:0060845503 \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\"]], about our similarities with and our differences from our cousins the chimps and bonobos.)<br /><br />He also notes that while modern societies suppress the thirst for revenge, it doesn't go away. Hunter gatherers kill their enemies as part of their life, and go on with the other parts. We train soldiers to kill, but mostly tell them not to, creating a tension not common in hunter gatherer societies.<br /><br />Diamond has a lot to offer on the differences in child rearing between traditional and modern societies. He notes that most modern research is focused on WEIRD (western educated industrial rich democracies) societies. (The term and concept are not original to him.) In fact, there is a tendency to generalize what professors and students in universities believe to everyone. He thinks highly of the \\"allo-parenting\\" that occurs in hunter gatherer societies, where other adults and even older children help rear, protect, and teach younger children. He sees it as helping to develop social skills, and it probably does, but especially for the type of society those children live in. (More of this occurs in rural areas and small towns in the west than in more urban areas, such as Southern California, where both Diamond and I live.)<br /><br />Yet, for all the advantages he sees in the hunter gatherer lifestyle, Diamond notes that given the choice they choose to adopt a western lifestyle. They do so because living like \\"us\\" is simply easier and less risky than being a hunter gatherer.<br /><br />He discusses the theory of religion, which will offend some people and interest others. He frames the value of religion in terms of defusing anxiety and making people feel better about their situation, in particular giving meaning to what seems meaningless. Diamond notes that religion can be used to explain to believers how \\"thou shall not kill\\" can become \\"thou must kill\\" under certain circumstances as determined by authorities. A distinction can be made between killing co-believers and nonbelievers. He also discusses how the success of a religion doesn't depend on its being true, it depends on its ability to motivate adherents to conceive children and win converts. (Unsurprisingly, religions that discourage procreation end up as historical footnotes.) A big selling point of a religion is its ability to deliver a functioning society.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book Diamond become a bit polemical for my taste. His penultimate chapter (ignoring the epilogue) is a pitch for multilingualism. Now I have nothing against multilingualism, and wish languages came more easily to me. But I feel he stretches his arguments too far. After somewhat poo-pooing studies that suggest various intellectual activities slow brain decay and the onset of Alzheimer's disease, he uses similar studies on bi- or multilingualism to argue their benefit. He notes that most New Guineans speak several languages while most Americans speak only one. Europeans often speak several, but he describes that as a mostly post WWII development.<br /><br />But there are differences between New Guinea and the industrialized world. If you live in a group of a few dozen people speaking an unwritten language it makes a lot of sense to expend effort in learning the languages of neighboring groups. If you live in a country where millions of people speak, read, and write a written language it makes sense to learn to read, write, and do business in that language. And such languages are likely to have much larger vocabularies. In a language spoken by a small number of people who interact frequently, when a word stops being used it leaves the vocabulary. In a language spoken by millions of people over a large territory words leave the language less frequently, are picked up more frequently, and old words live on in writing. I say this not intending to disparage the learning of hunter gatherers, but rather to note that both they and we expend our energy in learning what helps us prosper in our circumstances.<br /><br />Diamond becomes very polemical in his defense of dying languages. There is a balance between the loss of cultural history when a language is lost and the advantage of more people being able to communicate directly. It is one thing to eradicate a living language. Yet much of what Diamond discusses is what he calls \\"moribund\\" languages, where a few elders speak a language, but no children are learning it. But if the elders don't see a reason to teach it to the children, is the loss so great (other than in an academic sense)? Maybe here the wisdom of the people exceeds the wisdom of the professor.<br /><br />He then has a chapter which is a pretty conventional discussion of the problems with the modern diet, especially excessive salt and sugar intake. Our lifestyle has changed a lot faster than our physiology, with some detrimental effects.<br /><br />The epilogue has a curious section in which he quotes kids coming to the US from other cultures and criticizing our culture. It's a bit odd and gratuitous, actually, given his earlier admission that, given the choice, hunter gatherers abandon their lifestyle for a western one. He backtracks a bit from there, but I can't escape the sense that he feels the need to polish the traditional experience after revealing many of its challenges.<br /><br />A fascinating book with a lot of information. But the author's heart sometimes gets in the way of his head. Very worth reading, but worth reading critically.<br /><br />I was provided a copy for review by the publisher, but have ordered a copy of the finished product for my library.ems meaningless.

B004UQ03P2|4.0|This visor does help with glare; however it also reduces the field of view.  We have a lot of windows in the house and this mac is moved around a lot.  With all of the windows the glossy screen was difficult to see at times.  This visor definitely helps in that area.  It was very easy to apply and installed perfectly the first time.  However I can tell it’s on there and the field of view is diminished.  My wife uses it and doesn’t seem to mind or notice the reduced field of view so maybe you won’t either.

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Wasn't a fan of the various Stargate series. Not that they were bad, far from it. But I never found any of the various spinoffs particularly engaging. Collectively speaking they were lightweight; more entertainment than a serious exploration of space and the potential of truly interacting in a cosmic community. That is until Stargate Universe.<br /><br />And I can see why the show \\"failed\\". It's the exact same reason why I got into it.<br /><br />Universe was different. A bleak and incredibly realistic approach in comparison to the typical scifi fare. More akin to the rebooted '[[ASIN:B0036EH3UC Battlestar Galactica]]' than any of the other Stargate programs, SGU was the diametric opposite of the comic book-like world of SG spinoffs; shows that were for the most part happily populist, predictably linear, and somewhat derivative - in my opinion.<br /><br />To me, SGU was going back to the source, the original film. A fantastical journey grounded in a world inhabited by realistic characters; tangible and fleshed people who weren't exaggerated cardboard cutouts intended for the tried-n-true scifi production line.<br /><br />In fact, you can see how inappropriate the cast of SG-1 was inside the SGU universe.<br /><br />Anytime he was on screen, Richard Dean Anderson's smarmy disinterested Gen. McNeil stood out like a goofy geek at a gathering of Green Berets. Rarely are comic book-type characters feasible on a dramatic stage.<br /><br />In a sense, Universe combined two favorite programs: '[[ASIN:B0044E9JU0 24]]' and '[[ASIN:B00062IDDS Star Trek Voyager]]' with a touch of one of my favorite sleeper hits - '[[ASIN:B002USF1UO Defying Gravity]]'. And I would make this observation: When Scott Ian of Anthrax came out as a fan of the rebooted Battlestar Galactica, he made the comparison between it and Star Trek - by laughing. He said the only thing they had in common was outer space; noting that BG was filthy, grungy, and truly desperate. You could smell body odor, see the tattered clothing, and even noted that he had been to the soundstage that housed the commander's toilet. Up close and personal, he commented that you wouldn't want to sit on it, not ever. That's the difference between SGU and other space faring programs - genuine filth and ugliness. And despite my fondness of Trek, my appreciation for SGU went so much deeper.<br /><br />Universe tells the story of a frazzled and disjointed group of civilians, scientists, and soldiers - forced to seek the only safe refuge available to them by way of a wholly unique planet-sized Stargate. A place quite literally beyond anything any known standard Stargate has ever achieved. The few pitiful survivors just barely make it to what appears to be a starship. But freakishly it's not one that has seen occupants for hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of years.<br /><br />Was the ship abandoned? Who built it? Why? How is it still active after all those years? What was its purpose? And most importantly - how do they get home? Questions that the ragtag group have to figure out.<br /><br />Carrying precious little water, scraps of food from survival rations, almost no medicine, and dealing with what appears to be a spacecraft coming apart at the seams - the group's constant companion is Death. Likely to be a one-way trip for the survivors, that terrible realization only hits them as they begin to settle into the cavernous ship they learn has a name: Destiny. With it, a simmering resentment that comes and goes like an evil tide, forcing them to deal with various factions and changing loyalties; pushing them to determine who will be in charge and what their ultimate goal should be. But not before undergoing mistrust, fear, tumultuous anger, and in-fighting over their stranded isolation.<br /><br />Uncommonly, the cast were completely developed and fully-realized characters out of the gate. Exceedingly unusual, as most know that the first season of any program is often the shakedown phase; actorsand writers learning the ins-and-outs of the roles, becoming better defined, and settling in as their on-screen personas. Few shows ever look and feel as polished in their premiere as Universe did, very few.<br /><br />SGU was an incredible and imaginative journey, something I could relate to and - all things being equal - would wish for if given the chance. Typically, the greatest enjoyment I derive from dramatic television is the same reason I enjoy certain novels: I think of myself as one of the characters, picturing myself in the story, so as to better relate to the adventure.<br /><br />Absolutely five stars. No question.and writers learning the ins-and-outs of the roles, becoming better defined, and settling in as their on-screen personas.

Peter Criss battled many types of failure and losses in his life- drugs, alcohol, broken marriages, band members betraying him such as Gene Simmons, cancer, his wife's cancer, death of his parents, restarting his life over as a tv star and solo artist. He is very honest and opens his heart and soul to his fans and readers of his story. I never knew much about this band but I really do now and like them. I highly recommend this book. Rock on!!!!

1400067820|5.0|Antifragile is the third book of Nassim Taleb's trilogy on the unpredictable nature of life.<br /><br />The first book, Fooled by Randomness, shows us what randomness in life is; the second book, The Black Swan, shows us how randomness works; finally this last book tells us what to do about it, or how to live in a world we cannot predict.<br /><br />For Taleb there are two ways to live well, both for yourself and for society. The first way is to provide a necessary service by being a dentist or a bookkeeper or a grocer. This is a robust way of life, it provides steady income that resists downturns in the economy.<br /><br />The second way is to be antifragile rather than merely robust. Being antifragile in life is a little like training: no pain, no gain. By subjecting yourself to manageable amounts of harm (or small losses, or time \\"wasted\\" tinkering with this or that gizmo) you are in fact strengthening yourself.<br /><br />He calls another property of large payoffs coupled many small failures \\"convexity\\" and calls the opposite (many small successes coupled with disasters) \\"concavity\\". Concavity looks strong and steady because of those small payoffs but the big blow-up comes from their fragility, and those many little gains ought to be a hint something's not right. Convexity, on the other hand, looks like a losing strategy because of the many apparent losses but they point in fact to an antifragile way of life. What hurts you, up to a point, makes you stronger.<br /><br />How can we be antifragile? Options. Taleb is a trader and though he hates being called one (he sees himself as a student of randomness) the vocabulary of finance always returns even when he talks about medicine or science. Everywhere he favours optionality, meaning a way of life where we try many different things in concentrated periods. He loves parties for the opportunity they give him to meet many people and he can then choose the ones with whom he'll have long lunches.<br /><br />In medecine, he means we should avoid interventions unless faced with a major threat to our health. Many small interventions might seem to help us but do we know the longterm negative effects?<br /><br />Sometimes, he's wrong. For instance he can't stand academic science and asserts that it has contributed much less than tinkering. He remembers travelling in the 1980s carrying heavy bags rather than pulling them behind him because no one had yet thought of putting wheels on suitcases. He asserts academic science failed and simple tinkering succeeded. I disagree and I suspect many people have thought of putting on wheels but whenever they tried, the wheels broke off very soon. Then when a stonger plastic was developed, one that could more easily resist the continual heavy stress, the wheels stopped breaking off.<br /><br />Where was this new polymer invented? It came out of a university or maybe it came from the research department of companies like Dupont or 3M; departments staffed by university trained researchers. Certainly tinkerers like Thomas Edison and Steve Jobs contribute no end, but Taleb shouldn't dismiss academia. If he does, I suppose it's because he stands on steadier ground when attacking financial academics and he incorrectly extends his experience in finance to other fields.<br /><br />I met Taleb once at a seminar. I'd been thrown out of the class for being clever and so that the lecturer could subject me to a blind experiment. Taleb, the co-lecturer, felt a bit sorry for me and joined me outside the classroom. We chit-chatted politely and he struck me as, of all things, a shy person.<br /><br />Nassim Taleb shy? Put him in front of a keyboard or in front of a TV camera and he comes across as the most arrogant S.O.B. you can imagine, even when he has a sympathetic audience! But when I heard him interviewed on French radio, I got it.<br /><br />When presenting his thoughts, he sounds the same in French as he does in English. In European French what in English isthought of as arrogant is in fact the norm. The French are often arrogant to each other and therefore don't notice it, or they don't think of it as arrogance. Taleb isn't arrogant; he's passionate and often exasperated. He comes across as an arrogant self-important man and it's a shame because this new book will put off many readers who will miss the wisdom it offers.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Nassauthought of as arrogant is in fact the norm.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down!<br />I can't wait to read the next two books.  I assume it will be as hard to put down as this one was
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I loved the entire serious except the last chapter in the last book.. it cut me off so abruptly.. I wasn't expecting it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was a lot of fun to read this tense page turner at the same time as my wife of 30 years (with the Kindle edition we didn't have the pass the book back and forth). In addition to being a great thriller, the book is about relationships - how often both partners pretend to be something they aren't in the early stages - how there is always something of a power struggle going on - how well spouses know and try to manipulate each other. I can't say much more without spoiling things, because you definitely don't want to know too much about this book before you start. Since some negative reviews mention it, I want to add that I thought the ending was great and even funny in a perverse way. A really fun read, especially for a couple.
B001OGWY1W|1.0|A great comic book has twisted.  As a Batman Junkie, I was highly dissapointed!  The bad guys all have guns and the good guy never uses one.  I didn't appreciate the propaganda.
0307744434|4.0|This book was very well written, it takes you to a new world full of intertwining lives and stories filled with magic and dreams that seem more real that aspects of the current world. Would highly recomend if you have some time to escape into a book.

B0053O89XI|4.0|Good Quality Blu-ray transfer. Plus you get the DVD version as well so you can loan out the DVDs to someone to bring them on board and still have the season if the DVDs don't make it back.  As usual, Box came in great Condition and was prompt even during the Christmas rush Season.

B003L77G6A|5.0|ITs Season 4 of the big bang theory. This is a dvd edition and it continues the good sound sound and image of the previous editions.

0553062182|5.0|Discovering Elaine Aron's book on HSPs, has been a most eye opening, helpful, and enlightening experience for me. As with other HSPs, I've wondered why I can't do things or be like other people.  More \\"normal\\", as I would say to myself.  Now I know that I am normal.  Just different than others, as I've always felt.  I can relate to so much in Elaine's book, it has helped me understand more about myself and to be a little more tolerant and compassionate with myself, as I am of others. I have always felt as though there is a battle going on within me.  Do I go out and be with others, do I join in the social activities I'm invited to, do I go shopping for fun, or do I stay home where I feel safe.  When I do go out and interact with others, I always have a good time, but come home feeling wasted.  And I don't mean from drinking.  From too much stimuli.  I'm not sure if what I am feeling is how \\"I feel\\", or that of others feelings that I have taken on.  So I tend to stay home more and more.  Now I have a book to help me through this dilemma so I can enjoy my life without feeling over-aroused/stimulated.  I think of it as an innate talent, of us HSPs.  We know when we've had enough.  And, now this book proves it.  Over the years I have come to understand that I intuitively know when I've had too much, done too much or need to take myself out of certain situations, and rest.  There are so many times when I just want to sleep, to escape the world around me.  Sometimes I just can't keep my eyes open any longer, and just fall asleep.  Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep because my mind is racing with thoughts and feelings. It's such a revelation to find a book so \\"right on target\\", like \\"the nail was hit on the head\\", \\"the light bulb has gone on\\", that explains what I've been feeling my whole life.  It's like she knows me, and we've never met or talked with each other.  Thank you Elaine!  You're truly a wonderful HSP to share your wealthof knowledge and own experiences as an HSP so the rest of us don't feel alone, or \\"too sensitive for our own good\\".  As it turns out, our sensitivities are for our own good, and for that of others, now that we know who we truly are.  A group of compassionate, understanding, intelligent and intuitive people.  By far not introverted, shy, or too sensitive.  We all have much to give to the world and the others around us, who don't really understand.  It's our little \\"secret\\" and what gives us the strength to interact in the world.  We have been given a wonderful \\"trait\\", if we all choose to see it that way.  Use it wisely and enjoy your uniqueness. Best to all HSPs and Happy New Year!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|As always, the piano guys make great music. I got this for a classical music loving grandpa. I think he really enjoyed it, and the rest of us loved it too!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|If you can suspend disbelief long enough to look past all the blaring plot holes and general awful decision making skills on both sides, then you might like his movie.

B0084B1T8Y|3.0|This doesn't appear to be the complete book to me. Someone should compare with an actual copy.  Seems to have picked up somewhere in the middle of the story...
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I read this book in about 12 hours! It is one that you can't put down once you have started, I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes a good love story! It's well written and you can (I could anyways) feel the emotions the author was trying to portray.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|Didn't like it at first, but I started liking it later on.  Some of the levels get too difficult to use -- so after a while I stopped.  Still, it was good for a while...
B004O3YGMC|1.0|No matter what I try I can't find my pc. Waste of money. The help site is also not helpful
B0088XQDD4|5.0|Nichol Williamson is brilliant in this movie. It's not as popular as the Mel Gibson or Kenneth Branagh versions, at least here in America, but that should hardly keep you away from it. The only thing that might put off first time viewers is that it's obviously an adaptation from a stage production, so, for example, you don't get to see the ghost (I don't want to see some Hollywood idiot dressed up in some ridiculous costume and CGI'd up). But what a cast! Anthony Hopkins, Marianne Faithful, et al...Shakespeare done the way it should be. I hope you'll be patient with it and really sit down and appreciate this version. Very much worth every minute of it.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|purchaced it for christmas. it was better than i expected and a great movie for Christmasday with kids. if you have young children a good buy
B005FPT51K|1.0|I was in love with this monitor at first, in spite of the incredibly obnoxious alert sound that you cannot change, and the over sensitive alerts that went off if so much as shut our front door. I liked the idea, and being able to peek in on our daughter from anywhere.<br /><br />After a month of use, the thing is a nightmare. Since the app update, the alerts are unchangeable- trying to open them causes the app to crash immediately, and the app store is filled with people with the same problem.<br /><br />Occasionally, my camera would not work and I would have to hit the search button once, maybe twice. Now it does not work at all, AFTER LESS THAN TWO MONTHS OF USE!<br /><br />Please don't waste your money, and find another, more reliable monitor.
B00821OW8K|5.0|I spent my entire weekend lazying around and watching both seasons of Falling Skies.  Wonderful series, can't wait to see what Season 3 has in store.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|For the action junkie this movie fits the bill.  We are familiar with the characters and already know what they can do.  Still the time flew by and a good time was had by all who watched.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This has too be one of the most fun I have had on my phone. I like the super simple drawing and game mechanics.
0439813786|3.0|This is a well illustrated book, and children will love it.  Adults may be disenchanted with the lack of text, but all in all, it was enjoyable.
0446554995|5.0|Three separate stories incorporate in this book to one exhilarating read.  Pendergast, Constance and twins as a surprise.  Each individual story blends into the other and you find yourself turning pages faster as your heart pounds.  The best Pendergast yet.  There is an open ending leaving room for more characters to enter...the twin who walked away, a new love interest for Pendergast, Constance as a mentor for the lesser twin, a marriage for the cop....who knows, but we all anticipate the next story.  These two authors think in tandum and have an infinite imagination.  One for the shelf behind glass.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|A friend recommended this game to me....I have to say it is better than I thought. the quests you have to complete are challenging, but really fun.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|This was an interesting concept for a movie.  I love Jason Statham and had no idea what this movie was about but since it had him, I had to watch it!  Have to say, I was thoroughly surprised at how good the movie was considering all the people that die in the process.  Would definitely recommend this film!  :o))
B00136RYXG|4.0|I always enjoy Pink's music. She has developed as an artist on many levels and personally grown as a person and it shown in her music.
B003V2HWP0|5.0|This movie was a true romance!  The scenes are very beautiful and I love all the snow!!  We never get that here in Texas, so I'm always amazed at that type of scenery.  The love story will touch your heart and bring a few tears to your eyes.  Highly recommend this film and think I want it on DVD too!!  =)
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This is a great upgraded version of Office for the Fire. I use it to open attachments, make edits, and send them back without having to go open them on my laptop. I was lucky enough to grab this when it was free, so all the better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much, I could barely put it down.  This has been one of my most favorite books from Nicholas sparks!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Definitely more appealing for the older generation. Shows how easily a good marriage can go wrong. I found it interesting and fun to watch.
B003719GGS|5.0|Quick read with great information. Dr. Chapman does a great job providing stories that reinforce the information and tips that he provides.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good read and provides an interesting look into the world of alternative (kinky) sexual encounters. Also an interesting take on a loving, but strange, relationship
B005RUUUAI|5.0|It is easy to see why AMC allowed The Walking Dead to have a Season 2.  The story line has you hooked in from the first season and you want to make sure that you don't miss an episode.  Viewer must be able to tolerate blood, gore and Zombies.
B00328R21C|5.0|This was a great Christmas gift for my son, as he was able to build it quickly and it came with lots of minifigures for action play
B0049VZ222|5.0|This TV Show is for someone that can tolerate blood and gore.  The story line keeps you guessing and wanting to know what happens next.  If you don't like Zombies, you will not like this show.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|The movie has everything you would expect and more from this type of action film. A must see if you've seen the other two.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a cute movie that boys and girls both will enjoy. The story is about a nontraditional girl and how she refuses to change.  Great Movie for the whole family.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game so far, worked my way through 5,6,7 and now on 8x8 levels.  Although only a part of the levels are free, there are plenty to keep you going for a long time and you can buy more levels if you want.  So far it has not been difficult but each level adds another row both ways, significantly increasing the challenge of the game.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a fun game to build concentration and mental acuity.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game.Its super fun.it roks im real good at it i loge it 5 stars is wat it deserves one of the best g5 games ever
B009WO7NQO|5.0|being a star wars fan, it's gotta be good. way to go angry birds! hopefully we will see more Wars.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I hadn't played for some time because although it is a cool game, my subscription expired and I couldn't pay for it. Now that I can play, I might buy some rumes or gold whenever I can
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|These Resident Evil movies have become much like the zombies that are in them. The series is a dead, pointless, brain damaged, shambling mess that seeks to consume whatever (money) you are foolish enough to let get in its way.
B0058RN85O|5.0|Hilarious show on a great quality blu-ray disc.  Great for anyone who loves the show or wants to have a good laugh!
0316227706|5.0|I bought this for my mother for christmas, it's great. They enjoyed the photos when they first made their way around the web, so I knew this would be a hit. All the best images are in here and the printing looks great!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Well done - finished up well ,kept you guessing.  Some good twists and turns I will be reading more of Jack Reacher!
B00540G3G6|5.0|This is one of the better conversions I've seen. Watched it on a Sharp 90&#34; lcd and it's really fantastic. The digital copy is a bummer, some people want to watch it on full size screens and not just mobile devices, but oh well. Someday they'll 'get it'
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Although it had a few good moments, overall it was an average movie with above average actors. Nothing new here.
B005TMSN4E|5.0|I bought this understanding that I wouldn't get advanced AF features, and I'm ok with that. I bought it so that my 70-200 would turn into a 540, for $200 I can get away with not having the features of a much, much more expensive lens. I've been shooting photos of a newly adopted dog with it around the house along with the 35 1.8 dx lens. It's been excellent for getting lots of light in and a nice narrow depth of field. It definitely adds some heft to the camera, but again that's a compromise we all have to be aware of and expect when adapting 35mm lenses to a tiny body.<br /><br />I need to edit my review and clarify something that just recently clicked for me. My 200 is NOT equal to a 540. There's no cheating physics, and crop factor is quite literally just cropping the image. If you were to place an image made with this adapter and the lens zoomed into 200 on top of an image from my d700 zoomed in at 200mm, it would look just like you cropped into the d700 image. The only benefit is that there are more pixels in the V1 image as opposed to a cropped d700 image. It's not zooming in any further. It's not magnifying anything. Certainly the subject will fill the frame more, but that's because you're cropped in tighter. For some, that's ok, but for some silly reason I actually thought I was getting more reach, and that's just silly. The same applies when looking at the standard 1 series lens selection. If you shoot with the 10mm, the angle of view is similar to something shot at 27mm on a full frame body, but the sensor is seeing everything through the glass of a 10mm lens, so the dof is the same and the view the sensor gets of the image is the same as a 10mm on a full frame system. Still, this adapter is useful, as you can use your existing glass with it, and you'll get more pixels on your subject then you would on a full frame body, but it's not the same as putting long glass on.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good reading very fast pace holds your attention keeps you on the edge of your seat well read more of his books
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good read if you are into this kind of thing...<br />Every chapter is very erotic! It's hard to put it down
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Much better than the fourth book, at least. I feel like some things that he's been leading up to in the last few books have been undone, though.
B008B9JTLI|4.0|I purchase DVD's to watch while I am in bed for the night.  I do not normally have time during the day to spend watching movies so I take advantage of the down time once I am in bed.  I normally fall asleep during the movie requiring that I start it again the following night and sometimes even a third night.<br /><br />I purchased SAMARITAN as it was in my genre and I happen to enjoy Samuel L. Jackson.  The problem I had was that I stayed awake to watch the entire movie.  Perhaps I do not get out enough but I found this to be a very riveting movie and I did not expect the ending.  It kept my attention and I enjoyed it. There is a lot of action but also a bit of a love story as well.<br /><br />I am not one of the better Reviewers who can give a Siskel and Ebert type rendition, I can only say that it was a worthwhile purchase, I enjoyed it and I will be sharing it with my friends until I watch it again.<br /><br />I would recommend this as the entertainment value far exceeded the purchase price.
0399157565|2.0|As a fan who has read all of her books I found this book to be a disappointment. Slow plot, not much suspense and too much detail in Scarpetta's thoughts. I almost stopped reading it, and would have if it wasn't written by one of my favorite authors.  Maybe she needs some fresh characters, although I have grown to like these I'm not sure I found any redeeming character development in this book. As a matter of fact I was starting to dislike them-- except for Lucy whose character only improves with age.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is very easy to read and functions great! Nice addition (no pun intended to the Kindle) I would highly recommend this app!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I was so excited to download this game and over the past few weeks we haven't been able to put it down. I know LucasFilms/Disney over does it with marketing, but this game is great. My 6 year old loves it and it's helped me explain the movies to him a bit better. Well done!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|lots of fun . cant wait for the sequel. worth the money.worked great. on my fire. hours of fun. I like that you had the choice of playing ho or card game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has a similar meaning as temple run and is actually better than any of the temple runs!!! I play this game every second of my spare time and it never gets old! I absuluatly love this game becouse I can interact and compete with other people and with friends and family. Unlock temple runs choices of characters there are many more characters to choose from! I bight recommend this game!
1419705849|5.0|This is a great series of books not only for the child who is moving beyond advanced picture books, but for the adult who likes to take turns reading out loud with their child. The illustrations add to the story and help to remind the reader that there are different ways to present the information.
B009LDXQGW|3.0|The cd is like one continuous song throughout the three disc. That is probably the reason why we are not allowed to listen before purchase. It might be good for background music for a house party but nothing upbeat. If you purchase this cd, good luck I hope you like it.

B007P3TMW2|3.0|The story brought back a lot of memories.  It made you realize how alone people were after just one day of terror.<br />This is a good story between a boy, father and mom that tells you people really are stronger than you think.
B00002ZMNV|1.0|This DVD comes with two DVDs part one and two the part two did not play at all and I bought it for my favorite song from metallica which is called ONE with like war sounds in the background and stuff.They guaranteed me it played. I tried taking out the DVD a couple times and try playing it again with no luck! I'm gonna call and see if they can send me another or give me a good deal on another metallica DVD?
B0093QDGEO|3.0|yoi would think that a movie that came from a tv show in the 80s with jhonny depp would be a bit more exciting and dramatic an  tell a better story line. it has many gay refrences even in the first part of the film, if i was in the theater i would of walked out with blush red face, actors did a goodjob portraying the people. and the dea careter depp playedy, a one percenter, in discize would of had a bigger part,seeing as how he ripped his mask off inthe end to revile hewas dea,<br /><br />over all i dont like. not enuff drama and in depth police actionaction, more gay comiteck

B008Y5QJ6M|5.0|great movie, itslike the gansta moviesof the 90s took direction from this move, with the way police treat people couse of diffret thinking or things there into
0062082353|2.0|While I have immense respect for Chris and all those mentioned in his book, I found it a very difficult read. Very poorly written and edited. I really wanted to enjoy the book, but the writing style was something you might find in a children's novel.<br />Thanks to all those American soldiers who put themselves in harms way for others......

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is both relaxing and challenging at the same time. While it is relatively easy to complete each round, the challenge occurs in achieving quick times. A good way to spend some time.
B0076DELIG|5.0|LIke seeing Harry get into and out of messes.<br />Michael Connelly books are just what I like in a mystery.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I bought this video because it was such a hit while it was shown in the theaters and I did not have a chance to see it.<br />However I did not understand the producers' point of making this video.<br />After seeing the bonus video of the interviews, I realized this movie was made from a very popular book series and the producers believed what is shown in this movie could happen in our days in the next few years. So this movie is giving us a foretaste of what may happen. That will be something quite scary to know!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I spend hours playing this game, so addictive and constantly changing levels.  A lot of fun trying to beat the clock to get credited for finishing off a level.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I went into this without expecting too much, but hoping for a decent book to pass the time. I ended up being unable to put this book down. It was captivating, with twists and different perspectives that kept it interesting. The pace was fast, which I like, and I am looking forward to trying her other novels after having enjoyed this one so much.
B0063IH60K|5.0|What more is there to say?  This is an age old game and it plays just the way I want it to. You have your choice of deals, it is very quick to respond and you don't have to 'drag' your cards from the deck.. Love It !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is very addictive. I like the fact that it becomes harder as you solve each puzzle and that you can restart if you mess up so that you can learn as get better.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is simply the best thing since sliced bread!<br />Since I usually fall asleep with my Kindle, the alarm is already set with a wide variety of 'alarm sounds' to choose from, multi-time settings, snooze... Just great, great, great!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play minecraft on xbox but wanted to play on my tablet while away from home. This app does the job very well. I love the fact that I can connect to my grandsons game on the server and play with him remotely (california to georgia).
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|What else can I say!  This game is everything it's cracked up to be.  Your aim and timing have to be just right and it's a challenge to complete the many different levels.<br />It's not just for kids (but us kids at heart) !
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I love this game. I have been playing carcassonne on xbox for years, it's very addictive. this app is very close to the original xbox version now I can play while away from home.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I could not get this app to download.  I want my money back! Can anyone let me know who I contact?
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game, very addicting. lots of fun and keeps you on your toes. very easy to play, my 5 year old grandson has no trouble playing this game. he's why I got the game.
B0002HWQEE|4.0|I've stepped on it numerous times and almost fallen, it hasn't cracked or broke yet! I was worried about the tail ball falling off/choking hazard, but it is on there really good. My 18 month old plays with this toy every day.
B000MDDSB8|3.0|This is a movie for watching with your girlfriends while eating ice cream and wishing you were having sex with someone instead of watching a stupid movie.  The acting is mediocre at best, the story line is written like they didn't even try, and it really is quite laughable.  BUT, if you want to have fun watching a movie, not to mention getting some seriously superficial man-candy in, this is a great pick.  It's just fun, even more so if you're watching with friends (I recommend putting it on mute and dubbing it over with your own dialogue, it'd probably be better than the actual movie anyway.).  DON'T expect a good movie, just an enjoyable one with a lot of hot guys and pretty ok special effects.
1581804849|4.0|Loved all the flowers! Nice and easy instruction book.<br />Her books give you the colors you will need so you can check your supplies and be totally ready to paint
B005I4JG80|5.0|I'm unsure how much of this I can use, but I loved that it was written like a story with all the parenting advice in the mix, made it much easier to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book held me Captivated from beginning to end. I  can't wait to read the next book. I recommend this book for any avid reader.
B003SOMYNQ|5.0|Of course this is a classic and it is also a wonderful book to read. I love this book as I am sure many others do as well
B0017I91LI|2.0|Lewis is one hell of an actor or after seeing lincoln maybe he isn't acting or it's easy.  It's really hard to understand the conflict or maybe they are all just nuts.  There are little lines that give you a hint but this is dark and boring.  I kept waiting for the punch line.  Anyway don't waste your time for this slow to neveer developing story......
0156027321|2.0|I did not enjoy this book at all. It is probably one of the worst books I have ever tried to read. Not a good book for anyone in my opinion
B002EXEGTW|5.0|Fantastic movie of a true event.  Tom Hanks is at his best.  A must see for anyone interested in the space program.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|You can't save pics from the app? Really? I just don't get it. Otherwise, functions great. But, you can't save pics? Really? REALLY??
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like Mobility Ware Solitaire and played on the kindle is exciting as I win a lot and I can carry it around.  However, I don't like the redealing, it takes to many steps.  I can't click one time to redeal.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I bought this movie for my boyfriend since we saw it in theaters and he loved it. He was totally stoked
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|The app is amazing but I keep losing money in multiplayer.  I have lost 40000 dollers in multiplier for some reason . Gameloft can you please fix this problem and give me my money.  Everything else is good.
B003UULY3O|5.0|This is a fantastic workbook styled text. Not only is it graphically pleasing, but the exercises and case studies supply an easy to understand methodology for creating business and marketing strategies. Whether new to business or a seasoned vet this book offers a quick and convenient modeling tool for building a business.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Great movie I love to watch it everywhere  this way I can see it whereever I am its very entertaining
B0063GORYU|1.0|cant figure bout how toplay it it is sofrustrating you need to include directions ewith each game that are clear
B006LSZECO|5.0|The unusual writing style keeps you glued to the story from page 1.  Terrific book....I am waiting for the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it even when its frustrating the mindless sort of activity every person needsi i would recommend it to anyone
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|and also free.. it is a really entertaining game with lots of power ups and stuff to unlock, give it a chance.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldnt put it down, wasnt exactly what i thought or like any other romance. I couldnt wait to get the second book abd keep reading
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|im not a fan of the angry birds games but these one kept me playing it for a while its cool to see it with a star wars theme.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this as I have been a huge fan of &#34;Alien&#34; & &#34;Aliens&#34; since I first was allowed to watch them in my youth... Being a Sci-Fi / horror lover, and the limited number of &#34;Descent&#34; movies in this genre... when ythis popped up as a gold box deal for 20 bucks I jumped all over it.<br /><br />This movie set is definitely for the &#34;Alien&#34; series fan, but I have yet to actually open and watch any of the disks. If you are new to &#34;Alien&#34; movies.. the first one is slower and more suspenseful, the seond one is pretty much non-stop action and fighting (my personal favorite) all the movies after &#34;Aliens&#34; (the seond one) were ok as far as continuing RIpley's saga, but tend to drop off in entertainment value and story quality...<br /><br />That said if you are indeed new to this series you may want to watch the first and second movies to determine if it is even your bag... if you do not get into either of those you probably wouldn't like the series as a whole. I say watch the first 2 however beacause they will give you a completely different feel for hoew this series was set up...
B001IF277K|5.0|Bought this battery for my father because hes using my x10 now.  The battery was horrid after a year. Lasted 4 hours maximum with barely any usage. This new battery fixed it though.<br />I have the Galaxy S3 now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an outstanding game! I'm waiting for carts and the tracks to come out, I can't wait for it! I would totally recommend this for everyone!
B00973DDN2|3.0|It just doesn't seem like The Killers put a lot of effort into this album.  It's very slow and boring.
B0097NGUJG|4.0|I happened to see an episode of Jools Holland where alt-j performed, and I was immediately struck by their unique sound.  Actually it took me a minute to adjust and realize what was going on.  Then I kept seeing their name on all these end-of-the-year lists, so I gave them a listen. I have to say, this really is some of the most inspired music I've heard in a long time.  This includes the lyrics, which really do warrant further inspection.  Alt-j on a Mac is the symbol for delta, or change, which is appropriate since this is a change indeed.  The way these guys craft a tune is just mesmerizing.  I hear all kinds of influences - there's jazz, stocatto choir, poppy upbeat what are those - xylophones? really? - with that gut-vibrating, dancey bass line, sampled audio, and a little aboriginal/Indian what have you thrown in for good measure.  Yet it all works.<br /><br />My only (and very minor) complaint is that some of the &#34;interlude&#34; tracks are not as developed.  Though they add to the overall feel and flow of the record, in some ways it seems like they may have been added as filler.  This really is a minor complaint though, and if I could I would give this album 4.5 Stars.  Awesome.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Being a young woman I didn't feel I could relate to a male BUT I was so wrong! I bought this because of a friends praise and a cheaper price and I am changed! A new favorite book! Real,raw and relatable. Definitely adding a hard copy to my library at home,GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|great item for a girl who likes to use their imagination to make several items.  Legos will last along time,
B009NQKXYK|2.0|if you're gonna spend your money on this film don't spend a lot of money on it AND have another waiting in the wings to watch because this film is terrible and you're going to turn this one off!
B0007MWZEK|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo38UZL7EZHZ36P]]as soon as you touch the corners it brok this item is way expencive for the quality .and i ask to return it they say i have to pay sheeping and is same like im buying a new one do not buy it and plus the charge is good for 5 or 8 minute
B003TSEEDY|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME! Read it in a day... :) I hope the movie is just as good because I have not seen it!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|this is a fun game I just wish that they could speed up how fast certain things get done such as the competitions
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It had lots of interesting words and phrases. Actually, it was not a bad thing that I got to be able to read
B0052U59F4|1.0|Poorly written! It's popularity is a sad testament to the lack of education in America. Your dignity is worth more than the cost of this book. Spare yourself the agony of reading it.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was funny and it was just mainly what a kid his age and what kids our age think and do. Two thumbs up.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This series is one of my favorites that I'll read again and again. I love the story, characters, and idea of the plot. Kudos to the author! Loved every single one!! Definitely read it!
B0053TMP24|5.0|A continuous new series right after The Lost Hero.<br />While this New book gives the readers view of the famous Greek hero Percy Jackson on the Roman side keeps reader on their toes gives readers a new quest they adore reading.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|Ok, the first 3-4 books were good. I could handle them. I liked some details and ideas. After that, it went DOWNHILL. It seems as though the authors were running out of ideas and writing whatever crap to make the series last. WASTE OF TIME. I was so mad and stopped by the 6th book. If you do take a chance, don't get your hopes up. But I wouldn't recommend this series at all.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I give the rating because it is good.<br />I liked when Rowley ate the cheese. I recommend this book to every when.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I've read the first 3 books in this series and I couldn't put any of them down. They are some of my favorite books! I'm not going to go into a lot of detail but it's a definite YES to buy them! You won't regret it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|She absolutely loves this game and I'm glad that I got it for her cuz it was free. I totally recommend it to people with kids or younger siblings.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I love this game on iOS so I have no worries that this version will be any different. After I got the hang of it I couldn't put it down. I do even like gaming on mobile devices. Once you learn the ropes you wont regret this purchase. Tip: Do a lot of contract work before your first game to build up your funds.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie is obviously worth the investment, as better reviewers than I have proclaimed. When you buy a 2-disc DVD, though, you hope for the second disc to take you well beyond the theater experience. This package delivers in that respect. No fan of the franchise, cinematic or literary, should be disappointed.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am a huge fan of this game and am so excited to have found this on the Kindle. I used to have it on my phone andnthe game would mess up all the time.
B005RYF5JA|4.0|It's impossible not to enjoy the music of Celtic Woman. However, since they are obviously such a made-for-PBS franchise at this point, the real issue for someone wondering whether or not to purchase the DVD is: What will I get for my money that goes beyond the concert I can get for free on my DVR? I'm such a fan that I have bought them all, but I am still waiting for the &#34;extra&#34; material that will really make it worth the investment.
1594481717|3.0|last edits were done in 2005, but much of the data taken from sources date back to 2002, 2003. That's simply too long ago to be relevant. None of the data reflect the Global Recession, or even the election of Obama. How do these new realities fit into the the Whole Mind paradigm?
B0041T7FS6|4.0|I love disco, since I grew up in the 70's. Chic were the definitive late 70's band. They had the best selling single of the 70's with Le Freak and they redefined disco for the latter part of that decade. They had a unique style and sound; simple, yet sophisticated, jazzy, danceable music. I love their radio hits but to me, the less known album cuts can be spotty. This collection puts together all of their hits as the band Chic and also brings the hits that they had with a number of other acts such as Norma Jean, Sister Sledge, Diana Ross, Johnny Mathis, Sheila and B. Devotion, Debbie Harry, Teddy Pendergrass, Carlyl Simon and Fonzi Thornton. What a career! For what was seemingly a 70's disco singles band, Chic had not only the most success of all of the similar acts from that era, they also accomplished more than most bands do in any genre.<br /><br />This collection is remastered and includes most of he 12\\" mixes of the songs. In most cases this is welcome. In some cases, such as Norma Jean's SATURDAY, it makes the song drag on. The song's lyric, \\"I just can't wait for Saturday\\", had me thinking, \\"I just can wait for the song to get started....\\". In other cases, such as on EVERYBODY DANCE, the long mix is what disco was meant to be, a song that lets you boogie for a long time. the remastering is very good. Definitely a step up from the 2006's The Very Best Of Chic. The only problem is that the bass was mixed up a little more up front and that kind of throws off the sound of the original recording. Otherwise, everything has a fuller, clearer sound. It still sounds like a 70's recording though. The Dimitri remixes are interesting as an alternate take, but sometimes ruin the flow of the original song, as in the case of I WANT YOUR LOVE, which happens to be my all time favorite Chic song. The sound is clearer, but the original is still more vibrant and energetic. If the original song had been included in remastered format but the mix not tampered with, then the remix would have been a fun addition. Here, I ended up missing the original. That song is THE principal reason for me buying this collection, so for me personally that was a disappointment.<br /><br />Even so, this is the best Chic collection out there for casual and hardcore fans alike. Rarities, remixes, remastered sound, unreleased tracks, it's all here! This also includes most of their best album tracks, so you also get the best of the rest when you buy this boxed set. The packaging is also cool, though the box doesn't fit in my cd holder since it is about 1.5 the size of a normal cd. Also included is a booklet with lots and lots of liner notes. The collection is entitled \\"Box Set Vol. 1\\", but I don't see how they could produce a quality vol. 2 since their very best material is already here. If you are curious about Chic or love them already, this is the one to get.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A little easy but fun to play. I just wish it was a little longer. I would suggest it to friends.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest so much fun. you will love it, post stuff and get useful ideas and there is funny pictures to make you laugh you should get this app
B005K17RU0|5.0|I find this app very helpfull when I wake up in the morning before I get ready for the day I just tap the Icon to find out how to dress.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I love Batman... I've been a longtime fan... I thought these Dark Knight ones did leave quite a bit of information out.... I thought this one dragged a bit... Not much gadgetry as what Batman is known for.  I would have loved to see more of that.<br />Would also have liked to see more Catwoman.. I don't even think there was anything said identifying her as Catwoman...
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I have put off reading this book for to long. It now stands in the pantheon of my favorite books.
B005LAII1C|5.0|In a time where all we have is movies with supernatural, vampires, and gladiators, a good comedy is what we need. This is it!! I couldn't tell you how hard I laughed throughout this entire movie... How many of us did we want our favorite toys come to life when we were kids?? I bet at lease 99.9% of us! This movie is a gut buster... I hope there's a sequel!
0671646788|5.0|Have not finished this book yet.  So far it has been helpful and enlightening. I would recommend this book to business professionals.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|After six attempts to download this crape over a four-hour period, I finally gave up.  It takes up FAR too much space, forcing me to delete nearly every other app I have, and it STILL said I didn't have enough space!  Thank God it was free and I didn't have to pay for it!!  Don't waste your time!
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game, lots of fun, touch screen makes it easy to make moves. would recommend to one and all. enjoy
B001NLCBJI|2.0|Getting a better view of Tokyo was cool, but I think the movie would have benefitted if it had an actual plot, other than Scarlett and Bill having a sulking contest, moping around Tokyo. My summary - he's bored, she's bored, they're slightly less bored together, and slightly less bored than the audience.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|This app could be so fun if it was not so expensive to get past the first few levels. Make the points a bit cheaper and this game would easily be &quot;5 stars worthy&quot;!
B003KTMW9K|5.0|Geralt of Rivia is one COOL Dude! This game ROCKS!!! I am in my 50's and I thoroughly enjoy this game. I bought this copy to replace my original set as my X got jealous and scratched up my first copy. So, I ordered a new copy and packed his things and moved him out. Wal-Mart only had The Witcher2 which is the next installment in the series. I hadn't finished the game once yet. Too many distractions and not enough free time. So, I was ecstatic when I found a copy on Amazon. So, even if you don't buy this game...and you should....check out Amazon for all your favorite games that are out of stock in the stores. We parted fairly amicably thanks to Amazon.<br /><br />Game play is like other games where you follow quests and such. The game interface is easy to use even for a novice gamer and older folks. So, many choices change the game play that you will probably wear out the disk before you exhaust the possibilities. Just like in real life your game choices affect future events and outcomes..not just your score. I really like playing the dice poker sub-quest. There are a lot of \\"mods\\" on the forum to enhance your game play and a lot of nice folks, both older like myself and young folks to help and just interact with too. Not like some games where the experienced players snub and maltreat the newbies.<br /><br />CDPROJEKT guys and gals really did a fantastic job creating this game. For experienced gamers the difficulty levels can be ramped up to keep you happy and wasting too much time in Rivia too. For us not so experienced, the easy and normal modes are challenging, but not so frustrating that you give up playing. This is a single player offline game with an online version battle arena. It only costs you the price of the game. Money well spent.
B0057ZEMF2|4.0|the Amazon notes give a good indication so the dislike or okay ratings shouldn't happen, i hope more of this style (fusion) gets produced
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Actually, I like the series. The cast is wonderful, the setting in a lunatic asylum is great. But the writers just went all over the place with the plot this season. Is it a ghost story? A serial killer tale? Science fiction? I'm confused.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love it! My sister and I play and draw laugh out loud funny pics! The new message feature is a plus. :)
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Lots of fun and easy to play. Playing on my Kindle Fire. Only issue is controls need to be more sensitive, but still plays great. Free version interrupts with game stopping ads...this one does not.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Picked it up as the free app of the day, and glad I did. Some of the levels get a bit challenging, which is a good thing! Great for when you have a bit of time to kill on your phone.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book was so much fun.  Zany, hillarious.  Walter Mitty-like.  Wish the author had other books on Kindle.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone that wants a &#34;feel-good&#34; book.
B003UESJF6|4.0|If you like Will Ferrell and Brad Pitt then you will enjoy this silly movie.  My grand children really loved this movie as well as myself.  I would recommend this movie for the family
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good Bosch novel.  Good read, not his very best, but close!  Interesting premise, lots of twists and turns, enjoyed it!
B004LROUW2|5.0|A great read. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.  Intelligent, insightful and way out there!  What is YOUR reality?
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|My wife bought this for me dec 30th 2012. To be honest I did not expect this movie to come close to ip man 1&2. But without hesitation I would say that this movie was more authentic, realistic, and just as much fun as the others. As I read some of these reviews, I realized that most people don't understand what this movie entails. The real Ip Mans son is in this very movie. Also ip mans sons real life disciple plays the main role. Dennis To is not as seasoned as Donnie Yen in mixed martial arts. But Dennis To's wing chun blows Donnie's out of the water. He was raised in it, and he is by far faster than Donnie Yen. This was such a great movie. Full of action, surprises, suspense, and you get to see how he originally meets his wife and saves his school and his master. Well worth owning especially on blu ray. GEt IT!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good game! great storyline. and graphics. I would definitely recommend this if your a fan of hidden. object games. great fun
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Got the e-reader version.  I had seen the movie first, wished I had read the book first.  I will read the rest of the series!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is lots of fun.  So glad that a friend reccomend it to me. I will definitely reccomend it to others.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|People really need to stop complaining!  Yes, you can pay to unlock levels, but if you're patient and get enough stars you won't have to.  Payment is NOT REQUIRED!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|The movie didn't loose anything at home. Still awesome.<br /><br />Not really sure what else to say here so this is filler for the required word count.
B007V80WUC|5.0|I did not know much about Circus Maximus, I was just introduced to them recently.<br /><br />My band mate let me borrow his \\"Nine\\" CD, and I loved it!<br /><br />It is some of the best progressive metal music I have heard in a while...<br /><br />I really enjoy the chunky seven string guitar riffs (very well done), the natural sound of piano in the pieces is really nice, and it's just a great album overall.<br /><br />There's a plenty of great musicianship on this album and I enjoyed quite a bit.<br />I look forward to hearing more of Circus Maximus.<br /><br />Guitar players: Mats Haugen, is an awesome guitarist! He has quite the performance on this album.<br />He writes some really cool heavy riffs on the seven string, and has some tasty intricate solos (have a Petrucci flavor, but still original).<br />Check it out!
B00005NB8K|5.0|If you are a Doors fan & haven't seen this movie yet, now's the time. This version of this awesome movie has been made even better with the remastering that makes the colors so vibrant you'll feel like you are right there! Definite thumbs up from me!
034580404X|5.0|I love these books.  Not only are they a great value as a trilogy, but I have just finished reading them for the second time!!<br />Highly recommend them!
B000K380NG|5.0|I ordered this for my boyfriend who is a huge Doors fan & it was the only Doors LP he didn't yet have. Not only was he ecstatic but the item was exactly as described & is in excellent condition & plays great!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A decent fast read. Not sure if I truly liked he main character but I got caught up in his story. Not my favorite John Gresham book but definitely entertaining.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I got wrapped up in the story from the moment I started reading it. Some of it was pretty predictable, but I enjoyed it for the most part, quick easy read.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|She's very good, if a little too rehearsed sounding; Tony Jackson is, as always, a gas; Simon Phillips is why I bought this disc. He is a total monster in this show.<br /><br />A must have....
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Why is there not another book?? Ugh. Thank God for this series!! Read it in about 3 days... Peeta I love you
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book continues to be consistently compelling, and well written.  The challenge of switching characters from chapter to chapter doesn't detract from the strength of the plot.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I got this app for the reason I couldn't figure out how to record video without buying an app. When I record the only place I find that video taken is in this app itself, and I haven't figured out  how to share videos, Bluetooth and other sharing methods for the videos would make this app a real 5 star app and worth the $2. Anyone know how to?
B00APUYWYA|4.0|enjoyable - but predictable... still it was fun to watch with my daughter after watching a bunch of scary shows before it :)
B008QTVNUI|5.0|High suspense show. Mandy Patankin is fabulous. If you like spy type dramas you will love this. Homeland is very well done.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This spine-tingling game keeps you on the edge of your seat in a suspenseful mystery that only you can figure out! &quot;I could not put it down!&quot; &quot;Amazingly well designed!&quot; &quot;I rate it 5 stars!&quot;
B00338QENI|5.0|Read this fascinating story to find out why this woman's cells have continued to grow since 1951 and are still saving lives today.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Amazing show! Gripping and keeps you interested throughout each episode. Season two and three are very good. It's a bit unclear about the purpose of the story lines in Season four but if you like the show it is good to watch it as well.
B009MO5G90|2.0|I love Resident Evil and always enjoy Milla in tight leather. However, this movie just sucked. I almost got mad at it while watching it. I felt they just picked a bunch of things people liked about the other movies and stuffed them all into one messed up &#34;story&#34;. It was a hodge-podge of scenes with little connection and there was no plot! None! By this time, they should be moving the story along but all they did was mash a bunch of crap scenes together. Ok, so there is a story. Here it is. Alice is captured and has to escape. That's it. I won't spoil it by telling the ending but there is the story.<br /><br />Here are all the bases they covered. Could be SPOILERS but it just doesn't matter. There isn't a story anyway.<br /><br />Nazi Zombies? Check<br />Big monster scene? Check<br />Dawn of the Dead Suburbia Scene? Check<br />Slow Motion Battles? Check<br />Milla in leather? Check<br /><br />I didn't have enough 3D glasses for everyone when we watched it but I figured I would probably watch it again anyway. Now I don't think I'll waste my time. It got to the point that I was laughing out loud at the stupidity of what was happening.<br /><br />So disappointed they wasted the opportunity. The ending hinted at the story I was hoping this would be.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|So far I think it's great. Challenging but fun with decent graphics and a good storyline. One of the better ones by G5.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a really good deal for all 8 Harry Potter movies. The set does not include the extra discs that came with the earlier movies but that's OK. I bought this collection to watch the movies not the extras. We have not been disappointed with the quality of the DVDs. The price was excellent for the entire collection.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show. Can't wait till it starts back up again this coming January. Best show to watch and learn about history.
B009POCFTG|1.0|Normally, Matthew McConaughy's movies are pretty decent so I was eager to watch this. I even went out and bought it. My mother and I watched it from beginning to end, and when the credits started rolling, we looked at each other in total disbelief.<br /><br />It was truly that bad. It's rare for us to be so speechless, but that's exactly how we felt. We had no words to convey just how awful the plot was, and how none of it made sense. I felt like I needed to take a bath just to wash off how grimy this movie made me feel.<br /><br />It wasn't funny, thought provoking, or even much of a mystery. Just a really bad portrayal of what Hollywood thinks folks in a trailer park must behave like...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show. Can't wait till it starts back up again this coming January. Best show to watch and learn about history.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I just finished the third of the author's three dark tales.<br />You would not expect these books to be written by a woman!<br />The stories are rich, surprising and addictive.<br />The characters extremely interesting. Each book has a \\"heroine\\" you would not love, but couldn't walk away from.
B005UA0FLE|4.0|Not 5 star great but loved it.  Has traditional and new songs and makes for good background-Christmassy music to set the mood.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This was included free when I purchased my Canon T3i before Christmas and I also bought a Canon camera bag at the same time.  The Canon bag is OK but it is a little small to carry all the items I would like.  This backpack is large but it is really nice and the interior compartments can accommodate all my gear needs.  I am very impressed with this bags quality and padding and I believe it is a great buy if you need to purchase a nice bag for day hikes and photo ops.  I'll use the Canon bag when I just want to carry essentials because the backpack is a bit large to carry for more casual uses.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My favorite book of The Hunger Games trilogy! There were so many unexpected plot twists that kept me on edge...I'm sad that I'm finished with the series, I am going to have a hard time finding another book that I will enjoy as much as I enjoyed these three...
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was enlightening to read how the &#34;sharp edge of the country's sword&#34; constantly maintains that edge.  Also revealing was the part about the briefing for the Osama bin Linden mission.  It seems the part about &#34;capture&#34; was omitted from the &#34;capture or kill' mission statement.  A very good read.
1594630844|5.0|Love this book!  I had actually borrowed it once from my local library and It is a book that I want to keep on my permanent book shelf so I decided to buy it.  Really good advice...thank you!
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|The movie itself is great. Five stars for that. Minus one star because everything about the packaging is lacking. The DVD cover is blurry and the spine just has &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; printed in block letters. There is no real design. There is no insert inside, just the disc. The case itself is very cheap. But if you're like me, you care about the movie on the disc. This is a great way to get a modern classic for very cheap.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|This as any disney movie, will be timeless for the years to come. This will surely be one for the collection to enhance your disney collection. And for future generations to come, that they may enjoy during their time. Get yours...
B0050R0XEG|5.0|I bought this for my sons.  I loved the detail inside and out!  There were compartments inside, curtains, sliding doors and opening moon roof.  This will bring you back to the classic VW van you remember so well.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Full of suspense, twists and turns, and keeps you guessing.  I had imagined a different ending...mine was better than the authors.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|From December 1968 to December 1972, twenty-four men traveled the void of space on a voyage from the Earth to the Moon and half as many actually walked on its surface. In the HBO miniseries \\"From the Earth to the Moon,\\" the history of Project Apollo is dramatized.<br /><br />For the most part, the series is heavily based on reality and historical events. Viewers are taken back to the 1960s and early 1970s as we become familiar with the many people who not only flew the spacecraft but also worked as engineers and managers. The acting is great and the special effects, especially the scenes that take place on the lunar surface, are for the most part astounding.<br /><br />One of the strongest points of the series is how stories most of us never heard of are brought to life. Everybody who was alive in 1969 could probably tell you where they were when Neil Armstrong stepped off the Lunar Module to become the first person to walk on the Moon. Many could probably tell you about the harrowing journey of Apollo 13 (no doubt helped by the hit 1995 movie of the same name). But what about the critical development of the Lunar Module and the flight of Apollo 9 (as shown in episode 5)? Or how Pete Conrad and Al Bean had more fun on the Moon than anyone else on Apollo 12 (as seen in episode 7)? Or even more down to Earth stories such as how the wives of the astronauts had to deal with the stress of new found fame and raising children (episode 11)?<br /><br />The only weak point in the series is episode 8 which covers the drama of Apollo 13. While it is understandable that they did not want to re-make the movie Apollo 13, what we get is a rather silly story about a bunch of fictional characters (including a Cronkite-like news anchor) squabbling over journalistic ethics.<br /><br />I have watched this series many times over the years and have always thoroughly enjoyed it. I would highly recommend this to those interested in spaceflight, the Apollo program, or the drama of one of mankind's greatest adventures.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Hoping to get my money back. My daughter was very disappointed.  We called Life Proof to check the registration number and they told us it was fake. Everything else I've bought through Amazon has been fine.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is a well written book full of excitement and stories of the sadness of slavery in the South,<br />I read it in 3 days as couldn't wait to know what happened next'<br />The ending could have been better and seemed to leave me with a lot of questions making one wonder if a sequel was forthcoming.Therefore,only 4 stars
B007TXN4TK|1.0|It was difficult to figure out what you were suppose to do.  Unless you understand the keys, you spend all the time trying to keep up.  Would not recommend.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|Very user friendly. Nice graphics. Simple to install. No glitches. This game kept my interest so long that I feel the need to keep playing until I finish the game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great,and the movie really sticks with what happens in the book.everyone should read this book.can't wait to read the next one.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|This is a must read for everyone! I would recommend it for a college graduation gifts and I would give to parents and grandparents before they decide how to distribute their worth, regardless of how much they have to distribute.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book gets better with time. I love sinking into the old world customs and imagine myself without phone and just pen and paper for communication.
B008476HBM|5.0|Great read! I wish we still spoke in such eloquent terms. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great classic. Enjoy.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really impressive genre fiction that is more nuanced and more three-dimensionally developed than most mysteries and courtroom dramas. It's full of surprising twists and turns, but is thoroughly grounded in the emotional journeys of its narrator and main characters, and raises worthwhile questions about everything from the legal system to social media to bullying to parental responsibility. I really enjoyed it, and it was a quick read.
B0040JHLG8|5.0|I've had several versions of this shoe and love it.  It's perfect for my kind of stride.  I would highly recommend.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|The movie was mostly funny but seemed like it was dragging on at times. Overall I would watch it again after some time has passed and I can't say that about many movies.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|The movie was funny and it has some good moral lessons for the family.  The entire family enjoyed this movie
B004EPYZUI|3.0|Sucker Punch is a beautiful, showy mess. Though the plot left me wanting, it's there to service the intense and off-the-wall action sequences. I couldn't pass up owning this on Blu-ray for the deal Amazon had on Black Friday. It's great eye candy to have on while doing other stuff around the house - you can go about your business during the talking parts and then sit down to watch the fun, CG-heavy fighting sequences. Some movies are fine to stream on Netflix, but on a movie like this with tons of fast action and a lot of visual data, having the Blu-ray keeps the picture crisp without any of the compression artifacts and blurring that can come with (even HD) streaming.
B00886XQO0|3.0|I've owned pretty much all of the popular headsets over the last 6 month's so I have a pretty good feel about what's the best for \\"me\\".<br /><br />Here's what's important for me (Sound Quality, Battery Life, Comfort, Mic).<br /><br />Based on that criteria the A50's were hands down the best when compared to the Tango's.<br /><br />Sound - The a50's absolutely sound better. The Tango's have a very hollow sound, cheap drivers. The a50's have a very rich, full sound.<br /><br />Battery Life - The a50's sport a higher quality battery than the Tango's and have a longer battery life by quite a bit.<br /><br />Comfort* - This just depends on your head I guess, For me, the a50's and a40's just feel so much better. The Tango's have a very loose fit.<br /><br />Mic - I found the Mic's to be somewhat similar in quality<br /><br />Build Quality - The Tango's look insanely cool but they have a very very cheap feel to them. The a50's have good style and have a very sturdy build.<br /><br />That's the stuff that matters to me and in pretty much every category the a50's were a clear winner. Yea, the Tango's have a lot of features but who really cares? Am I going to give up GREAT sound for very bad sound just so I can morph my voice? or pair my phone with Blutooth? No, I am not.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, get the a50's and don't look back.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Rating 1-10 At least 25!<br /><br />Harry still struggles to be everything to everyone in his life. This only creates a more human character. For those of us with a passion for our chosen careers, Harry is a hero.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app is a typical scaled down from the internet phone app. Having said that, it does have much the same functionality as the Ebay website, though not all of it. For free, can't go wrong.
B00973902K|5.0|I like it, it's a good song for getting some exercise.  I wouldn't recomment this for boys, they tend to grimace when hearing this.  Best to listen to it and decide for yourself, everyone has different tastes.  Just because I enjoy it doesn't mean others will.
0399229191|5.0|We love this book, I read it to my granddaughter often. She loves her books and this holds her attention. I recommend this to any one who wants great short books for young kids
B009VSW15Y|3.0|when I turn it on it points the camera at me (the person taking the picture) not the other direction. there is a button on my iPhone that causes the carers lenses to point in the opposite direction but I don't see that on this app although I'm sure it's there sone place.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|to start, the price here on amazon is outrageous. i bought mine from google. and i felt that at least one person should review the product and not the seller. the bumper case in my opinion is beautiful. looks great and feels really nice. the chrome looking buttons and sides of the case look nice and make the phone look as if there wasnt even a case on the phone. my only nit pick would be that a lot of dust collects on the edge where the case and screen starts, mainly due to the rounded edges of the screen. but if u can get your hands on this case from google for $20, than its an excellent buy.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|This will be fun for a while - turn your kindle to steer. Probably for 8yrs  + I'm 66, I'll play with it for a couple of weeks.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|A movie about a teddy bear &#34;R&#34; rated.  Seriously? There are a few funny lines but don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just like the fair game except you won't go broke playing! I've been playing for 2 days and it has not frozen once- which happens often wig some games.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really liked this book it has so many emotions and it really overall was one of the best books I've read in a long time! I sometimes have trouble finding a book I really like but this book sorta changed that. I loved how the characters really spoke what was on their mind. The author definitely had a good plot for the story it kept me interested all throughout the book. So kudos for writing such an amazing, touching book!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|What an amazing story. As an English teacher, the no holds barred story penned by Dickens is essential to remember not only during the holidays, but each day before and after. My students remember the Muppets and Mickey Mouse versions, and while they are pretty good for nostalgic purposes, this read really brings about the true message of living with Christmas in your heart. To some people this may seem like a &#34;dark&#34; book, but that was the purpose; to scare the readers into the realization that there are consequences for our actions.
B007NR9WBG|5.0|BRAINSTORM is Natalie Wood's last film.  It is also a literate and well-made Science-fiction thriller with a solid story and a very sympathetic Christopher Walken.  The love story between Walken and Woods is first-rate--and central to the plot.<br />The Blu-Ray is a first rate transfer with near-perfect picture and great sound.  It does the film justice.<br />This is a great feel-good film and a good one to share with that special someone in your life.
B0086700CM|5.0|it's excellent! give it a try! you'll easily get addicted. plus it's free and you really can't justify not trying something that's free.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book is a fun read and leads you to think about the strengths and limitations of technology in our computer era. :)
B00AMS4YVQ|4.0|T.I. is back with his 8th album Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head. His 2010 Album \\"No Mercy\\" was rushed and underwhelming, but now hes focused and back to putting out good music. Trouble Man was actually supposed to come out in 2011 but it kept getting pushed back due to not having that monster single his label was looking for. He released videos for \\"I'm Flexin'\\" featuring Big K.R.I.T. and \\"Here Ye, Hear Ye\\" featuring Pharrell but they were just warm up singles. Alot of people wrote him off and labeled him with \\"fell off\\" tag. After listening to this album I think its safe to say T.I. is rejuvenated.    The album kicks off with \\"The Introduction\\", which sees T.I. sampling Marvin Gaye's \\"Trouble Man\\", the hook is similar to \\"Rubberband Man\\" but slightly different \\"Trouble man, always in trouble man/ Grand hustle man, I'm the mother****in' man Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man/ Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man\\". \\"Wildside\\" (featuring A$AP Rocky), \\"G Season\\" (featuring Meek Mill)and \\"Trap Back Jumpin'\\"  are bound to be club bangers. T.I. fires back at his detractors on \\"Addresses\\", which is rumored to be aimed at Alley Boy. Other standouts are \\"Hello\\" (featuring Cee Lo Green)and \\"Sorry\\" (featuring André 3000), on the latter T.I. has no apologies and explains the things he had to do to get where he is, Andre 3000 takes a different approach and apologizes to several people with the following lines \\"This that s*** that'll make you call your momma/ Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford/ And this the type of s*** that'll make you call your rap partner/ And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for f***in' up the tours/ I hated all the attention so I ran from it\\".    There are songs for the ladies too, on \\"Can You Learn\\" (featuring R. Kelly)they wanna know if you are willing to learn how  to love a man that's always into trouble. \\"Guns and Roses\\" (featuring P!nk) has crossover appeal, its obvious that this will be a single, T.I. speaks about being in a love/hate relationship \\"Have you ever loved somebody so much you can't stand it but can't do without 'em?/ Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em/ Like dedicate songs, write poems/ But they be on that bulls*** and you try to ignore 'em/ But you feel like they feel like you ain't right for 'em/ Therefore your heart's torn\\". The album isnt perfect though, \\"The Way We Ride\\" could of been left off. \\"Cruisin'\\" sees T.I. singing, but it wont catch on like his 2008 hit \\"Whatever You Like\\". \\"Ball\\" (featuring Lil Wayne) is weak compared to the other tracks on here even though the hook is catchy. Missteps aside Tip is back in full force. The production is good, we get knocking beats from 1500 or Nothin', T-Minus, Lil C, DJ Toomp and many more.

B0051ANPZQ|1.0|I love the book it is so touching and heart felt I truly love this book to bits and pieces
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Nothing new under the sun, really, but a diverting two hours or so.  Genetic relations with its genre fellows on display throughout.  Acting fine.  Sets a bit predictable.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is beyond words. So much feeling. If you don't like this book you didn't deserve to read it in the first place.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|It's very nice material, sturdy and I can put it in my purse!  I would recommend it to anyone who gets the Kindle.
140131046X|4.0|I have always enjoyed reading Mich Albom books.  This book will take you into the lives of several people as told through the main cariture.  It is an easy read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not much of a reader unless it's a very good book, I couldn't put this book down. Read it!
1401322786|5.0|&#34;The Time Keeper&#34;,  I don't know where Mitch Albom gets his ideas, but this top the charts.  He starts you in the very begining when there was no such thing as time, and will take you into the lives of people that have nothing in common but in the end it will all become clear.  After you read this book you will look at time in a very different way.
0547391005|5.0|Love this book.  Hard back - good price.  My Grandson loves these stories.  I like that the entire collection is in one book.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|grew up with a piano and never had the patience for it...never learned to play but really enjoying this ap.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Could not put it down.  Highly recommended.  Well worth the money spent for my Kindle HD.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I did not expect the ending. This was an awesome book.  I could not put this great book down. I loved it.
B000GCFX3Q|5.0|Marian Keyes is a treasure.  She writes about women's issues with humor and empathy.<br />Like having a chat with a good friend.
B009LA1R34|3.0|If your a fan of her other albums you probably pre-ordered this like I did. Thing is she has an amazing career behind her so one would think she would keep knocking' em out of the park. Her last album was great a little on the slow side but, great other wise and the performance was Thalia. I just didn't feel the passion in her music in this album, I know she is lovely and joyful woman and it really broke my heart to write a not so high praise about this CD. I guess we all get old at some point just happy to see she hasn't lost her beautiful smile.  I truly do love her but, a little disappointed. Still fans will buy this album irregardless.<br /><br />Si su un fan de ella otros álbumes probablemente pre-ordenó esto como yo lo hice. Es que ella tiene una increíble carrera detrás de ella por lo que uno pensaría que ella se mantenga golpeando ' em fuera del parque. Su último álbum fue gran un poco en el lado lento pero, gran otros sabios y el rendimiento fue Thalia. No siento la pasión en su música en este disco, sé que ella es una mujer encantadora y alegre y realmente rompió mi corazón para escribir una no tan alta alabanza sobre este CD. Supongo que todos envejecen en algún momento feliz al ver que no ha perdido su hermosa sonrisa. Realmente amo pero, un poco decepcionado. Aún los fans comprará este álbum irregardless.
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|Ouch! Is all I can say.  I lost my movie picking privileges with my husband after choosing this one. This movie was so cheesy and painful to the ears, that I thought maybe they meant for it to be a parody of the broadway show. Russel Brandt and Alec Baldwin need to stick with comedy and stay out of the recording booth. I'm surprised to say that the best part of the movie wasTom Cruise, who put on a fantastic performance and can actually sing.<br /><br />Looks like it's all action and sports movies for me for awhile. Thanks Rock of Ages.
B00190OHD6|4.0|I liked the soundtrack as well as the story. One of the few movies i can watch more than once.
B00ARAO720|3.0|Nothing spectacular about this movie.  Enjoyable and worth the $4 I paid to watch.  Action was OK and so was the plot.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was not at all what I expected it to be. I expected a typical love story that had its typical share of bumps along the way. Man was I ever wrong! The twists in this book were so unexpected. I did think it dragged a little at the end but that didn't really affect my love for this book! It was awesome!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|we are totally hooked and can hardly wait for season 3. We had a Downton Abbey marathon over the holidays.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's life experience as he writes in Proof of Heaven, is described in &#34;Quantusum&#34; a novel by James Mahu.<br />It was just amazing to read his story, as it matched many parts of the novel so perfectly.<br />Dr. Alexander's adventure into other dimensions that have not be accepted by science, gives hope to those<br />that have had such an experience hope that they too will now believed by their medical teams.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Loved the cinematography and how the story had parts of the original Snow White theme in it with the poisonous apple and the dwarfs.  BUT, I too am not a K.Stewart fan. I thought there must be other young actresses much more beautiful to portray this character AND someone with stronger acting skills than Stewart. How about Rooney Mara for instance?<br />That said, the movie's ending was weak to say the least. There's this longshot of Stewart looking really clueless and then the closing credits. How lame.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought this was a really sweet book even though it was a bit confusing sometimes. I just wish I knew more about what happens to Charlie.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|They claim to send all of the movies but i only got the first 4. then when i sent them a message about it nobody has contacted me back. dont do it.
1452110581|5.0|I gave this book to a friend with one cat. Her reaction?  \\"OMG!!! This book is hilarious!\\"  I've ordered more books to give to other friends.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|So raw and realistic (and so King). Great character development and tons of emotion. I like that the main character and love interest don't have it easy. Makes their relationship all the better.  King brings back the creepiness of Derry Main from IT, but still allows main story to shine.<br />Would have liked if it was connected to the dark tower series though.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Very disappointed the kindle camera was meant for Skype and not to take regular pictures. This is kindles fault not the camera
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|loved this,couldn't stop playing.<br /><br />highly addictive. I urge anyone who likes hidden object games to play<br />this.absolutely brilliant.game play is totally awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|well I was a fan of temple run but when I started this game I forgot all about it. I mean this game is honestly better you might say it just copied well it didn't. Because when it a new holiday it changes so it looks like the hoilday example Christmas. They kept the obstacles the same but change the setting. And I don't see temple run doing that I mean after playing temple run too long it gets boring because nothing changes well I. here it dose. I really love this game and BEWARE ITS ADDICTING
B0094BB4TW|1.0|At most,I can view 5 posts.  Then it just has nothing.  This needs serious work.  We also need the FB messenger app.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW!!!<br />I can't start to describe what this book made me feel!!!  Just WOW<br />You start loving it right away, and then you can't let it go.<br />After slammed, I thought this book could be good, but no it is<br />Amazing.<br />Thank you Colleen.
