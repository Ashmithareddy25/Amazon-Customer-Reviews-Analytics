B001TH6ET4|5|Fit my 05 hd xl883c like a glove. Didnt have to relocate the tail lights. Made of good quality leather.
B002MXE1XA|5|2 for the price of 1 couldn't beat it.
B000CQOIR8|1|Total garbage, waste of time and effort, sits too low on a Chevy express van, should not be listed as fitting this vehicle. Manufacturing is of poor quality, splines meant to keep the bolts from spinning don't work because the hold they sit in is slightly too big. &#34;T&#34; that is meant the keep the frame bolt for spinning while tightening is too short, so the bolt spins. Complete misrepresentation.
B008GG6FDQ|2|Very white. compares to 5000k color temp. not very bright at all.
B00VAVVHLE|5|This was a great value.  We will see how long they last
B001MV1LE0|5|Work great on my jet ski trailer - no more wrapping up the straps after unloading and then getting out the straps again to lock the ski's down.  Great product.

B009D9HEJO|5|Very nice packing
B000E8XFJG|5|Best filter for the money on the market.
B00DUM2M0Q|4|Item arrived on time. Not quite exactly as pictured but does match the written description of item.
B00E4CQE2I|5|These glasses are great. The are lightweight, yet very durable. If you don't drop them a lot they will be fine. I did have one pair where the lenses cracked, but I dropped them a few times. The frame was just fine.
B00BAKMTG2|5|I just purchased Spray Nine to see if it would remove seven year old stain on my vinyl siding near my deck from sloppy staining done on my deck over seven years ago.  My vinyl siding is beige so I was afraid to use a product too strong that it may take the color off.  I sprayed this product on and was able to take the stains off within minutes.  For the larger, more stubborn stains I used Spray Nine and brillo and that took off most of the stains without taking any color off the vinyl. I think for the little bit of stain left I may spray some of this product and leave it for a few hours and then see how it does.  I am going to try cleaning mildew off the gutters too with this. I highly recommend this product.
B00BSZJKE8|5|I have a small face and have a hard time finding sunglasses to wear while riding on the motorcycle.  Others I've bought in the past have the vented foam but it makes you sweat a lot and the foam comes off after awhile.  These glasses are comfortable, fit my face well, the vented foam is a lot cooler (you still sweat) and I am really happy with these glasses.  In fact I went to their web site and ordered a pair that didn't have that blue coating on the lenses.
B006N9CPFK|5|Fit
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Excellent product. Very satisfied.
B003CKFKI2|5|Works just fine.

B000H6O2VA|5|Perfect color match for the 2000 Escalade looks great just be sure to clean and prep properly and this will look good for years to come. Just wished I could find a color this close for my Trans-Am
B010OU90PG|5|great quality, easy to apply. their customer service was wonderful to work with when I had to contact them after my package was lost in transit. will definately use them again!
B004SCIY6S|3|Took about 6 months of wear to corrode and look horrible.
B00L3YKSXG|5|Beautiful
B000EVU89I|4|what I expected and what I needed
B00V302KSQ|5|Works great great price

B001OZQEHI|5|This product is awesome, I and will continue to use and recommend to family and friends..
B00L2PDFV8|5|Just perfect, easy to install
B002XZDLGU|3|Having never worn armor before, I really like these guards and feel naked without them now. They are comfortable and have proven to be protective (had a good spill).<br /><br />Only problems:<br /><br />I wish they could be made a little less bulky, but not a huge issue. They fit comfortably over most types of jeans and even fit underneath some of my cargo pants.<br /><br />The sticking on the calf-velcro has pulled out completely after 9 months. The manufacturers website wants me to send them back through amazon, back to them, then wait for word on a replacement that they will provide through amazon while I ride without protection. NOT worth it and the reason for the low stars. I will sew them myself.
B007WIDPK0|5|Fits very nicely and should do a good job protecting the dash.
B0000AY9W6|5|works. fair price. not much else matters :)
B0018JVEEI|1|Amazon says this fits my car. The gap is far smaller than my cars specifications. Re-gapping is not advised.
B00AFO749Q|1|Strap Fall apart easy
B00267PZUK|5|This tool is amazing and a life saver.  I am a novice mechanic that tries to do only the basics (oil changes, brakes, spark plugs, etc.)  It was easy to use, the you tube videos online were also very helpful.  I had two spark plugs break off, and it extracted them both.  The only struggle I had was with removing the spark plug tip from the tool.  With good vice grips (straight in the teeth, and no curved so you can grip into it with the teeth), I heated it briefly with my propane plumbing torch I finally was able to easily remove it from the tool (you could probably remove it without the torch).  Make sure you go clock wise as well, as that was my first problem.  It is a must for any Ford Triton 3 valve engine with the wonderful issue of spark plug corrosion.  Would have cost me at least hundreds to tow it into the mechanic to extract it to me.
B00BYGMEGC|5|Awesome
B008G3KG70|5|Excellent! Both headlights came brand new and included 55w bulbs. Identical to the oem in size, weight, and shape. I would recommend these to anyone.
B00CTE4O9S|5|I have a 2006 Honda XR 650 L, and I ordered these as cheap replacements. They perform alright, especially considering how inexpensive they were. But if you really want quality stopping power, I'd pick something a bit more expensive/higher quality.
B001JT1JZG|4|Good for the price
B00QCHU578|1|Would not recommend! He says sticker that holds the rubber to the tank let go of the rubber pad the first day and took over an hour to clean the adhesive off of the tank. Looks cool but does not stay
B0018L2LR0|5|Love!!
B00MD3FLQU|5|I installed on the front of my new 2015 Toyota Sienna van.  It matches the color of my van perfectly.  I get a lot of comments on it.  It is well made with thick metal.  I expect it to last for several years.
B00A82A3RK|5|Great
B0009IQZFM|5|Great towel.  Would buy again.  5 stars.
B00C5RB03W|5|no more wasp nest
B00D8RYHHE|5|Great so far cant beat the price
B0018JXFA4|5|Arrived fast easy installation,comes with instructions, works great and it's a real denso product part
B0049B52I6|5|Bolts and doughnut, super stuff.
B004MDSQ6Q|3|One of the cross tips on the screw driver broke on the second use, poor quality. Did not end up using the nail cleaner at all, stick with the original design has better quality and is more useful.
B0016IT4HA|3|Will this cable work for console shifter auto trany 4x4?
B00DNXSZGM|5|Great product easy to install
B000C9JX4I|5|Works like a MAP SHOULD. I would buy again.
B007EZOIMU|3|The cross bars and stanchions are very heavy duty. There are no instructions provided, but these are not difficult to figure out how to assemble. The biggest problem is that the attachment clips (the parts that clamp onto the window frames) are not formed correctly for most vehicles based on all the complaints I've read. I was able to bend these clips using a vise and an adjustable wrench to make the bends of the clip align with the profile of my roof line/window sill. Once I did that, these started working great. Initially I was very concerned because the clips would pop off unexpectedly. Once I changed the curves of the clips, those problems disappeared. Took me about 3 hours to mount initially, mainly because it took me a while to realize that I have to bend the clips to make them fit. If I had known that up front, then this whole job would have taken only an hour initially, now it only takes minutes since everything is now properly shaped.<br />I also found that standard 1' pipe insulation fits perfectly on these, so for $7 I now have nice padded cross rails that I use to transport my 90 lb kayak with no problems. I use this rack on my Chevy Cobalt with 4 doors.
B000CQHUJ6|3|Worked fine.
B00KTI0KKI|5|This is the second set i ordered and I am very pleased. Quick shipping. Was easily programmed and fit our Dodge Caravan. Saved me $250
B00NFSNAS8|1|This seemed like the perfect tire pump - able to run off a cigarette lighter or an outlet, and with a soft case to keep everything together. The first unit I ordered arrived with a smashed AC adapter. That is forgivable - things happen. I exchanged it for another. The second unit arrived with something loose and rattling about inside the compressor housing. Hoping it was something not critical to the functionality of the pump I gave it try, filling a bike tire. The compressor went up in  smoke on the second tire. With two duds i cannot recommend this pump - the quality of  the unit is just too poor.
B000GZEU8C|5|Great plugs
B00WQHMMVK|4|smaller than i expected but still a useful compact little organizer for trips in hot weather
B00466V9AY|1|Said it was made for my model/year truck but it never worked.  Considering how little I paid for it I'm not surprised,
B001GMZH5E|5|Exactly as described.  This is a solid hitch receiver ready to be welded onto your iron/steel bumper.  I have had it welded onto the rear of my 5th wheel (onto the sewer hose carrier) to accommodate my bicycle carrier.
B00KTIQAZW|5|works excellent.
B000BLI22Q|5|Easy install. Now my wife can get in easier.
B004WLNZZA|4|Fit the seatbelt well.  Velcro closure doesn't fit tightly at the ends (curls up a bit), but serves the purpose of protecting neck and chest.
B0013UEYHQ|5|Not as throaty as my mbrp that i replaced but for the price im not complaining!
B000778LCU|5|The right product at the right price.
B008ZDYLC2|5|Excellent scanner for the price. I have used it on three vehicles. If we had taken them to a garage for diagnosis($80 plus per diagnosis), it would have cost more than the scanner and OBDII extension, that we also purchased,together. It has already paid for itself. I wish it came with a case though but for the price I will find a case for it. Also I would recommend putting a screen protector on the screen.
B003UF0944|5|I wear a size large, and the large fits me perfectly. I like all the adjustments, it's easy to fine tune the fit. The jacket is just as described in the advert. Shipping was timely, and the packaging entirely satisfactory
B000GZPAM2|5|Excellent product. Very easy to install and totally resolved the problem of the OEM axle nut loosening. I do wish there was a way to set the torque before locking it down but I haven't had a single problem since installing it other than bending the supplied rod for tightening/loosening.
B000IYR7R2|5|All worked well and got the part fast
B0085FOF0S|5|fast turn around, easy to install, looks great
B000P4WDI8|4|Fit properly, no leaks.  All I need from a water pump.
B00AFVOFFK|5|solid well built hitch
B00KULNR2C|1|Worse brakes ever .. Very dissapointed make lots of noise
B00WL5BZ7Y|4|Works well.  It was a pain to replace on my Ram 2500 diesel, but fixed my non-functioning cruise control issue.
B002UC2Y0U|5|OMG, this stuff really works!  I was scrubbing the yellow discoloration from the white gel coat bottom of my Boston Whaler boat with soap and it wouldn't come off... This stuff worked liked instantaneously, as I sprayed it on.  I really didn't think it would work so well, but it did and I would give it 6 stars if I could.  Not very often does a product exceed expectations like this one did for me.  Hopefully Bio-Kleen will feel so grateful for this glowing review that they will send me a free case?
B009XRQYA6|5|Love it wish I had ordered a bigger one
B00JYMZ8HK|5|It works great.
B007UMC8SI|4|Like the color scheme of the yellow and black best.  Looks like something that would belong on an aircraft.  Also serves to rock the H.P. humble house colors.  Will look better with some wear and tear, to give it that grizzled, 'worn', patina.
B00C2Y4P7G|5|Very easy install.  Five minutes max.  Great product....clean look.
B00J4ZA8I6|5|Just like the one I took off with one exception this one works LOL!
B00T54HW7Q|4|Listing said that face and thermo were missing. It failed to say that the exhaust tube was also missing. Furnace was slightly damaged, but it was repairable.
B004BP78UU|5|This has added a touch of whimsy to my very staid silver Prius. And it goes well with my swirls and paint splotch magnets!
B002JFEETW|5|nice set of shades.
B00144D28I|3|We have 14 of the Hella fans on board our boat and it's kind of a love/hate relationship.  We have spent the last five years cruising in the tropics and having fans are essential, not a luxury.  We still have a couple of the Hella fans that were made in Germany, which are excellent but the ones built in China are inferior.  They're noisy, they vibrate and they don't last as long.  We've tried other fans but as bad as the Hella are, they're still the best ones out there.  We're taking four of them back to our boat, two to replace failed ones and two more to have as spares.<br /><br />Fair winds and calm seas.
B00AA2F03K|1|Nothing what I expected very cheap looking especially the stitching.
B00V1MUF9W|3|Ok but the loops are too small.
B00GWSFYDC|5|Got here quick, EZ to install on my Tucson. Grate look at a grate price. Thank you!
B001FCAYYO|5|I've owned a &#34;Rock Guardian&#34; since 2004.  Before purchasing the guardian my tow vehicle had hundreds of sand size chips from small particles being thrown up by the motorhome (even though I had huge mudflap on the back of the Motorhome which was supposed to keep stones and other particles from being thrown back). Since buying the Rock Guardian (2004) and a new vehicle (2006) my tow vehicle has been completely protected. The &#34;Rock Guardian&#34; has worked exceptionally well over the last eleven years, and still looks as if it is in new condition.
B00G7GCRPW|4|Not bad for the price. Core is little smaller than stock but no problems
B00KTIUG5C|5|Works great and easy to program
B004W97IY6|5|Have not had them fog up or anything. Look great and very bright. Will buy for my next dodge!
B00ARUPXTQ|5|Fits perfect  in my 05 f150 lariat fast shipping too
B000CNMXQ4|5|Great
B00KTHWT08|5|great keys! remote signal works really good.
B00DMM1LRY|5|I'm obsessed with this lanyard ! Perfect for any KH fan ! Comes with the keyblade as show . It's very sturdy & doesn't seem like it'll tear on me any time soon !
B005T3QZSY|5|Exactly what I ordered great!
B000C55M7E|5|excellent product, work perfect
B00O1UYEF2|1|I had bought this at a local store and everyone should NOT BUY IT. Since it was a cheaper air freshener, I was expecting to not smell as good or not last as long as worst case scenario. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong! After having it in my car for two days, it popped open and leaked all over my car radio since it was placed in the vent above it. I had followed all of the instructions and have no idea other than its cheap product couldn't hold up and leaked on its own. Having a scented radio wouldn't be a horrible thing if it weren't for the fact that it actually caused the finish on it to bubble up and peel off! My brand new car now has a horrifying discolored, molted radio. I'm devastated!<br /><br />Whatever you do, DO NOT buy this. The chemicals will leak and are so strong that they ruin finishes. Learn from my awful experience.
B004AHC57K|5|Quality fuses. No problems here. Good assortment.
B0080N331W|5|Perfect-you'll swear you didn't pay enough!
B000LY9ID0|5|2004 3500, Great fit and looks great. Couple of bolts were a pain to put on, but that is Dodge's fault. Very happy.
B0000CBIK5|5|A solid-performing hand pump. When I first got it, I thought the plastic handle would break after awhile, but it has performed well for over two years.
B00WQHMMVK|5|Clean cars are happy cars this puts everything up and away.
B000WK9BW6|5|Great for putting on the corner of the monitor at work!
B0002BGELQ|3|They are very, very tight to get the fuses in. If you use pliers or a tap hammer you can get them in, but you'll need pliers to get them out. Seller refunded part of my money so I'm keeping them. They will work in a pinch, but not my preferred product.
B000WPAJ7C|5|Needed a new one for the wife's Nightster and it's never a bad idea to have a spare one of these on hand just in case.
B001DH0QKI|5|YES YOU CAN DO IT YOUR SELF MY OIL MAN SAID $65.00 I SAID SEE YA
B0002V9IFK|5|good
B00M78820I|5|Works great and folds up nicely.  I struggle to fold it properly sometimes, but I think it's a personal problem, not a product problem.
B00COYNZJ8|4|I bought two of these sunshades, one to use and one to save.  It is the coolest thing, really.  I mean, turn my car into a Millennium Falcon cockpit?  No way!  I just wish it fit my Honda Odyssey.  It's not big enough.  The visors can't hold it up.  I ended up using my other sunshade instead.  Such a shame.  I really wanted to be able to use it.  Still, I give it four stars for the cool factor.  I know a lot of people will buy it and not use it, just like the one I bought to save.
B008VEJSB4|4|The gloves are comfortable in both hot and cool weather.  I feel better riding while wearing them instead of using my bare hands.
B000WK4EC8|5|Works great on my husbands motorcycle.  Cuts the grease without too much work
B00CNX98TQ|5|Works great, fits snug, I love it. I love it more than the one I bought from the dealership for $30! I recommend this purchase!
B00OGXI00Y|3|Sticker is good quality. The bad part is that mine didn't come with the comma as pictured and the picture makes it look way bigger than it actually is.
B004C444V6|5|These gloves fit great, feel nice and are very well made. I've used several other brands and have to say these are my favorites.Very happy with this purchase!
B00HQZCCA8|2|So, I purchased these knowing full well that they would likely require some modification, most aftermarket parts do, but I did not realize just how bad these would be for the money you spend on them.  They look great! However, the fit was BAD...bad to the point of having to shave the brackets to keep them off the brake rotors and then bend the covers a bit so that they would clear the wheels.  The install is simple enough, but be prepared to fiddle with them to get them to work.<br /><br />The main reason for the two stars is, that they are thin aluminum plate that is far from what I would call sturdy, they require putting the wheel on, checking clearances, taking the wheel off, readjusting, thinking you have it right, going for a drive, getting a terrible squeal after the heat makes the metal expand slightly and rub in a new place.  That is perfectly expected if this product was $50.00.  I have to say, I was shocked at the fit and materials for the $200.00 price tag.  So, was it worth it? Probably...they look nice.
B001MOYXOC|5|Just what I was looking for...!!!
B00T2GT9L4|3|I am trying to buy one today the promo code doesnt work anymore...only 4 days....
B005G5R5LQ|5|Good quality , easy to pore with no spilling . There was a little flashing that was sharp on the handle. I took a knife and shaved it off . Other than that minor<br />Issue , I am very pleased . The nozel was very well designed w no spills.
B003L35936|5|There is none better!
B00COYNVPQ|5|I bought this product two months ago and I still love it! I read a few reviews about the image rubbing off. It hasn't rubbed off!
B00E0VCDPU|5|Perfect.
B00VU0YAUU|5|So far it is working good.
B00WVNHLGK|1|Cheap metal too thin to weld and the clamp together design that's on it won't hold it together
B003V9VZ42|5|worked as expected
B00W6IXOJS|5|great to keep rain out  while parked with windows cracked<br />also while driving and keep sun out depending on how sun is<br />in sky
B000BQW5LK|5|This has got to be the best tool that is out there for refilling axels through the diff cover. I would recommend this to any and everyone.
B000C9ULIK|5|Perfict fit.
B002R0QP8M|5|After backing up and hitting an object shattering my taillight, I ordered this. It was easy to install even for this non mechanic chick and inexpensive. Good Value, matched and fit perfectly.
B000E3EWNE|5|excellent grip and looks great<br />a little tough putting on<br />just a little patience will stretch on
B0040M31H8|3|Great plate after I tore off the made in China sticker.
B005TCMDZ4|4|Nice product,  well made so far . Heavy duty
B0017KOPEO|4|Good
B00ICSOZ8K|1|Would not recommend.  Much less expensive than Genuine Harley and the quality represents that.  The mold markings were very visible on the product and the paint had many blemishes.  The company did warn of this and I am partially at fault for still buying but didn't think they would look as bad as they did.  The company was really good about refunding my money, however.  Save yourself the time and spend a little extra to get the real deal.
B002DSBJTS|4|They seem to be working for us.  We are used to the beep.  It is not annoying at all.
B00UY8B7VY|5|Love my new hand grips. Easy to install very durable.
B004JBVPCI|5|good light
B004D4URV6|5|I originally bought this product to help make shifting easier on extremely cold days. Last winter I had occasion to drive my Soul when the temperature was -10 F or lower, and the gearshift could be pretty stiff for the first few miles. I figured switching to a synthetic could help free things up a bit because synthetics tend to have better cold-weather flowability.<br /><br />However, I waited until the spring to make the change because, well, who wants to change tranny oil lying in the snow in sub-zero weather? Not I, that's for sure.<br /><br />It's only August as I write this review, so it's still too soon to know how the cold-weather thing will work out. But after several months of having this oil in the tranny I've decided that the benefits are enough to strongly recommend it regardless of whether or not it improves cold-weather flowability (as I fully expect it will, anyway).<br /><br />The improvements were dramatic and almost immediate. By &#34;almost immediate,&#34; I mean as soon as the car was operated in each of its six gears. The gearshift was much easier and smoother to move, which of course was expected. But the most dramatic difference was in the sound. The synchro whine common to small-car manual transaxles was GONE. I mean, it's virtually silent.<br /><br />The transaxle is so silent, in fact, that for the first week or so I found myself shifting late because I'd subconsciously been using the synchro whine as an aural cue to shift. Without the whine, I was shifting much later than I would have before. I'm a bit of a hypermiler, so I generally shift at about 2,000 RPM on flat terrain when I'm not in a hurry. But after switching to MT-85, I found myself not shifting until 3,000 to 3,500 RPM because the tranny wasn't singing to me anymore.<br /><br />The silence was almost spooky, to tell you the truth. I had to retrain myself to get back to my normal shifting pattern without the whine.<br /><br />I can also report a small increase in average MPG since I switched to this oil. I can't say with certainty that it was all a result of the change, but my average gas mileage has increased by about 0.4 MPG since switching to MT-85. Your mileage may vary -- literally.<br /><br />One more thing that's important with regard to the specific car in question (2012 Kia Soul) and other cars that use GL-4 gear oil: This oil is specifically made to conform to GL-4 standards. What your mechanic uses almost certainly isn't. So if you're paying someone else to change the tranny fluid in a car that calls for GL-4, I strongly advise you to buy it yourself and bring it with you. If the mechanic whines about it, tough. It's your car, you're paying the bill, and you're the boss.<br /><br />You see, here's the problem: In order to reduce their inventory, too many garages use so-called &#34;universal&#34; fluids rather than those specified by car manufacturers. As someone who's been driving manual transmission vehicles since I was 16 -- which was quite a long time ago -- I've found that supposedly &#34;universal&#34; transmission oils dramatically increase the risk of premature synchro failure when used in transmissions that call for GL-4. This true regardless of what the fluid manufacturer says. Meeting the GL-5 standards unavoidably means incorporating characteristics that can cause premature wear of the copper syncros commonly used in vehicles that call for GL-4.<br /><br />Long story short: cars that call for GL-4 should get GL-4, not GL-5 or some supposedly &#34;universal&#34; gear oil. There is no such thing as a &#34;universal&#34; manual transmission oil, no matter how many oil manufacturers or mechanics swear on the holy books of their choice that there is such a thing. GL-4 means GL-4; and the MT-85 is a real GL-4. Its viscosity, lubricity, and friction modification are specifically designed to meet the needs of a transmission designed for GL-4.<br /><br />How important is this? Important enough that Red Line MT-85 is the *only*synthetic transmission oil that I will use in my Soul or any other manual transmission calling for GL-4 at 75W-85. No other synthetic gear oil even comes close to Red Line MT-85 in terms of its overall suitability for these vehicles.<br /><br />EDIT:  January 5, 2016<br /><br />Just an update: It was about 6 F (-14 C) this morning, and the gearshift movement was smooth as silk. Last year in weather like this, it was much stiffer. Switching to this synthetic definitely solved that problem.<br /><br />EDIT: February 28, 2016<br /><br />Another update: A couple of weeks ago the temperatures here went down to -19 F (-28 C), and the gears were still nice and smooth. If cold weather is your problem and your car calls for a GL-4 gear oil of this weight, I highly recommend it.L-4 at 75W-85.

B009IK9RXO|5|Just what I was looking for !! Great deal ...
B00EC2CG9U|5|perfect
B006VU5WX8|4|does the job but is cheaply it machining, that is why it get 4stars and not 5
B00802GIW4|5|these lights were sent to me with the wrong adapter I had to jerry rig them to get them to work properly and now they make a buzzing noise when turned on. However they are still burning bright and it has been over a year. Make sure to angle your headlights down so you don't blind the other drivers.  UPDATE: August 24th 2015:  Shortly after posting my review I got an email from Kensun customer service asking me to tell them about my problem and asking how they can fix it. I explained to them briefly in an email I quickly wrote using my iphone that I ordered the kit on amazon for my car because amazon showed that the model was compatible with my car, and that when I got the kit I found that It was not compatible for my car. The customer service representative named Bradley was very nice in the email and she confirmed my make and model of my car. She sent me the correct HID kit and even sent me the upgraded BiXenon 8000K bulbs and a relay harness, which they sell for $79. I only paid $39 for my original kit and it was not even BiXenon because I did not want to spend $79. The replacement was sent to me priority mail and Bradley emailed me a tracking number too. I have not had time to install the replacements yet but as soon as I do I will post an update. I have to say 5 star customer service and It was completely unexpected.  Incredible customer service I have to say just buy the Kensun HID kit for your car and if anything is wrong the customer support will contact you and fix it. I really got the feeling that this company is very concerned with doing anything it takes to make sure the customers are satisfied even if it means they will lose money or make no profit. I'm impressed. Also my friend who is a professional photographer for car shows saw the lights that I had to jerry rig in and he told me that they look like high quality HIDs and are nice, he said they don't look like some of the cheap ones that he has seen and I think he said something about you can tell by aflickering or something. I will post an update on how the BiXenon's look and preform as soon as I install them.  UPDATE: August 26th 2015: I attempted to install the lights today and realized the customer service rep sent me an incompatible relay harness and also incompatible bulbs. This company is total s***, disregard the positive things I said about them before. The rep told me they would send a bixenon replacement and a relay harness. Not only did they not send me a bixenon kit, the bulbs they sent me were single beams that were a different and incompatible model. They relay harness is also single beam. No stars if I could. This company is total s***. BUYERS BEWARE! NO STARS IF I COULD! THIS COMPANY IS FULL OF LIARS AND TOTAL S***!  UPDATE: September 2nd 2015: The company sent me the correct bixenon lights and bixenon relay kit. I installed it today and it works great. I take back the negative comments from my last update. The customer service is excellent and will do whatever it takes to make sure you are satisfied with your purchase. The HIDs are high quality too just make sure you order the correct/ compatible kit for your car. I am including photos of the bixenon 8000k kit that I recieved as a replacement which looks great. Thank you Kensun! :)  5 STARS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SUPURB CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  UPDATE: December 22nd 2015: The bixenon kit is still shining bright and working great. It has been raining quite heavily where I drive and I have experienced no issues at all with the kit. Thank you Kensun.
B00OMQCADS|5|Looks exactly as pictured.Put it on my silver Jeep Liberty and it looks really pretty.Arrived sooner than it was suppose to.I like that it doesnt look like something just a teenager would want.Script is lovely and blends well with the design so you dont just see three black letters when you look at it.
B0050CVFVG|5|Nice product. I utilised these stickers on my displays in the STEM Lab at a historical aircraft museum.
B001DCEMQM|3|Not as bright as I thought it would be.
B000B8JUGQ|5|Arrived very fast and is just what I needed. Thank you so much!
B0009IQZFM|5|Excellent product
B00COYNVME|3|I put it on the visor of the passenger seat, which is a tan color...now there are black stains on the visor wear this cd holder wrapped around. Item looks good, just irritated that my visor is stained
B0043I7MYW|5|Perfect update
B003NU0EM8|1|i was able to pull on the dent like 10 times and then the rubber just tore. Real bad quality!
B004BTBCNK|5|These have been on my 95 325is for about 4 months, no issues with them!
B00COYNVKQ|4|Passenger side fit great, cut the driver side and now its a perfect fit too
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works very well, folds easy.

B000C11JSE|5|fit perfect. no issues at all.
B00B0C1MB8|2|Update 10/02/15: The separate front rotor I ordered from Amazon (suppose to be the same as the front rotor in this package) has been performing well with the new pads (akebono proactACT), and both the rotor and pad surface are smooth after several weeks of driving. The front rotor in this package actually is DIFFERENT than the separate front rotor I order as the replacement. Although they are the same model, and by calling powerstop and they confirmed they are exactly the same, but the one in this package, the slot in the from rotor are shorter than the one I ordered separately. So, to save your time, and not be frustrated, I suggest you do NOT order this package, but instead order the front and rear separately.   Update 08/16/2015: After yesterday and today, I put about 80 miles on the car. I took the front brake pads off to inspect the pads ware. Guess what, the same wear on the picture I posted yesterday appears on the new pads (Wagner Thermoquiet Ceramic). So it seems the problem is the rotor instead of the pads? I called Amazon and asked them if they can just ship the front rotors to me, and unfortunately, the only thing they can do is ship the whole set to me, and let me take the front rotors out, and ship the rest back to Amazon. What a waste of time and money. Good for Amazon, I found out that they also carry the front rotor separately. So I suggested the rep to just refund me the price for the front rotors and I can just put the order for the front rotors (JBR1383XPR). Two things: The JBR1383XPR is the matching front rotor for the 2012 Odyssey, although the Amazon says not. The PowerStop's site has the correct information. Not sure this model JBR1383XPR has some design flaws or just the rotors I've got. I will put on new pads when rotors arrive and report back the results.  1st, I need to complain about the shipping from Amazon. The rear set (rotors + pads) arrived fine, rotor in its own box, pads in its own box, and there is another box that hold both boxes and it arrived in one piece without any holes. The font set, which is stacked on top of the rear set, is a totally different story. the pads is still in its own box (scratches all over), but rotor's own box is no where to be found. They just stayed with the pad box together without proper padding. And the box has big holes on it, also some light scratch on the surface of the rotors. 2nd, I took the kits to the garage and have them installed it. After test drive, they noticed front sets has excessive powder comes off, so they took the front pads off and did some inspection. All four pads, both inside and outside edge, are chipped in. See attached picture. I have to get a different set of pads for the front. And Amazon did agreed to partially refund the kits. I'm not sure at this time if it is the rotors or just the pads, seems to me a little bit strange. I will monitor the brakes for the next a few days and report back.
B00CZG6WO0|5|great price and unit looked very close to the original. they work much cooler than the original. Much better price than I could find locally
B002ORWI7A|5|good stuff,
B0000VM18I|3|Works but several cans I ordered not much content.
B00Y1HULE8|5|Keys fit perfectly after cut. Transponders tested and certified correct before cut. Perfect for the price.
B00UW09GUS|5|YES IT DOES COME WITH THE &#34;LOWER MARKER/TURN LIGHT&#34; HOUSINGS AS WELL AS THE TOP HEADLIGHT HOUSINGS.....NO BULBS WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT NEED UNLESS YOURS ARE BURNT OUT.....VERY EASY TO INSTALL.....ONLY PROBLEM WAS HOLES IN TOP WHERE MOUNTING PIN HOLDS ON TO TRUCK WERE TOO SMALL.....HAD TO USE A DRILL BIT AND MAKE SLIGHTLY LARGER BUT VERY EASY TO DO....MAKE SURE YOU DONT MAKE THE HOLES TOO LARGE IN THE HOUSINGS AS THE PIN ON THE TRUCK IS REUSED AND YOU DONT WANT THEM TO SHAKE/RATTLE.....LOOKS GREAT! NICE REPLACEMENT FOR A VERY REASONABLE PRICE!
B00HZ42BFQ|5|it fit the tank they said it would
B0036ST6ZI|4|They keep you dry. I like this version more than my regular blue Frogg Toggs, for the higher visibility and pocket access. Not thrilled they don't already come with exhaust pipes shielding, or would br a five-star.
B007EEVJZA|5|Item worked very well
B00CPJBBDO|4|Not a bad fit and it looks pretty good.  Kind of difficult to get the armor settled into it when you're putting it on (tends to get twisted in the sleeves), but it's not too bad once you're on the bike.  Without the armor, it's just a fashion piece.  Could use a bit more room in the shoulders and arms.  All-in-all, not a bad warm weather choice.
B0068FVTPG|5|This is the best stuff. We use it for our hot rods before car shows. Fast order. Great price. Perfect shipping protection.
B00ESN7VVG|5|Item worked well, high quality, easy to use.  You probably need a good size compressor as this unit uses a lot of air.  Operating range for the vacuum bleeder says 40-170 psi, I had my 30 gallon compressor set around 90 psi and it turned on several times, but worked well.  Make sure you keep an eye on your master cylinder and keep topping it off with brake fluid so it does not run dry.  I am very happy with the brake bleeder and will use it on my other vehicles.
B00PU0MUJY|1|Horrible, despite specifically stating it'll work on a Toyota Highlander it's actually too wide and so is to saggy. If you're vehicle is wider than a highlander might work, if't not, I'd pass
B00WH1ZC80|3|work well as long as the hook is holding a bag.  Otherwise, they fall off the head rest post.  If not in use, place them somewhere safe for next use.  Wish they snapped on post and stayed in place.
B00EKHFCJI|5|works great
B00B9W4HDO|4|Conditions well. Keeps leather soft.
B003YXDJO4|5|as described
B00GSAUHB8|4|Really nice sunshade. Covers the whole screen, although it is a little too big for my car (Ford focus).
B007SIPAUM|3|Aaack!  Should have bought the aerosol version.  It worked, but not as well as hoped for.
B00GJZ0X8E|5|All my helmets (other brands) are size large, but someone told me to order XL for a Nolan and was right, it fits great. The quality is also excellent. Love this helmet!
B00AWGN67G|5|Just Installed on my Chevy Bowties. Looks good but looks even better when the sun hits it. Will now be buying all my vinyl wraps from JDMBESTBOY
B00BITKJNK|5|2008 yaris fit
B0036E9VB6|5|A terrific piece of equipment, very durable, fast and easy to use.
B000F11Z8U|4|It works, it fits, it stays put. Easy to clean and put back. What more can you ask.
B005JV7GJ8|5|Best tool ever invented
B001AIZ5HY|4|The fine sandpaper loaded up quickly.  I did not have enough of it to do both headlights.
B00W78DYVK|3|They work fine for my 2004 Saab 9-3 but they're a bit dim. It's been about 6 months, I'd guess, since I bought and put them in.
B00068XCQU|4|Works as advertised.  Like the bonus attachments for cigarette lighter, post clips, etc.
B0001EXNTA|5|The product is very good
B000MAK4LS|5|Did what it said it would do, now can fit 35 inch tires.
B002JBDH26|5|10 times better than the original part.
B00S8YC8GE|5|Fit my 1990 Kawasaki Bayou 220 perfectly and works great.
B004P1WNBE|1|Key snapped off in the lock within the first three uses. Doesn't fit under seat without spacers.
B0037YLIK2|1|The grips do not fit at all
B009J3L4RM|1|Would not work.
B00BWNSCJA|5|Easy installation, only small issue with the driver's side mirror. I had to make a very small indention on the plastic frame of the mirror, due to the epoxy inulation on the lens. Other than that they look good and function well.
B0096CTEMS|5|Works as it should with no issues
B00QXYL6LY|5|Love it. I have no problem, firm fit
B000PUG0JK|5|perfect fit for my 5 series
B0052FS2O4|5|Very pleased with this purchase -- I give it 5 stars.
B00JRFPNJ2|5|Put them on a 2011 ram 1500. They fit perfectly.  Easy to install.  Fast delivery.  Would buy again.<br />Semper Fi
B00S1WDSK8|5|Very bright, easy to install, very satisfied..
B00R9U8S3A|5|No more hesitation or rough idle, my D2 is now running super smooth. Quality product-fast shipping, thanks.
B0011V1S8A|1|These are not a Ceramic Pads as indicated they are ferro-carbon composite.  I didn't pay close enough attention when I bought them (should have researched the part number, totally my fault) and installed them.  I have slotted rotors that require ceramic for best performance.  After a few weeks of use it was obvious they were the wrong ones.  But I already threw away the box and decided to try and bear through it.  They are very dusty, noisy and very soft on my higher performance rotors.  Very disappointed in the pads, and at Amazon for not indicting the correct type of pad.  I hope they change the listing.
B00EYNBFSK|3|The white bumper I bought was quite a bit whiter than the white bumper on my car.
B001P11SCM|5|as advertised and expected....thanks!
B00QQ8M1WK|1|Doesn't fit whatsoever. Absolute waste of money. Looks to be closer to the e46 hood design in my opinion.
B00J2CHYZQ|5|Good source of light bright leds. they just didn't work very well in my halo headlight couldn't see more then 5 feet in front of my truck. so I gave them the my friend and he put them in his car and they worked perfect for his headlight. hi-low is awesome. good product I wasn't happy with my purchase but when I gave them to my friend they work great for him he's happy with them and still has them
B004OXPDC4|5|It was excellent worked perfect
B000BW8VMG|5|Fast shipping & reasonable . We haven't tested them yet though . Should work fine .
B000CMDATY|1|They didn't fit in the hole on the rim, stem was to small. Most wheels I work with are on implements and 3/4 ton pickup.
B001UOOY02|4|not had any night driving yet.
B00NI6U238|5|Great service! Part was great! Everything was great, thanks!
B00RGZWIW0|5|keeps things nicely organized..
B0068ERTSS|5|I have to admit, I gave it five star just going by the construction of it. It looks as if it will keep a typhoon away. We have yet to be caught in the rain while riding. I can't say that I'm looking forward to that happening, but it will sooner or later and I'm glad we'll have these along.
B00075XCCG|5|Fits 07 honda pilot perfect. easy install. about 10 mins with a helping hand to guide it into place.
B0002SRGXY|5|Great product, worked exactly like it said and very heavy duty. I've bought a couple OTC products and have been satisfied with all of them.  Definitely recommended.
B00GD4HQPE|5|Awsome
B000RYAWVG|5|Great price compared to in town arrived on time and fit my application perfect
B0009IQZH0|5|Excellent!
B00C5RAU9W|4|Fit & works
B00CEL0UX0|2|Cart runs fine.  I don't find any difference in speed or torque.  Not worth the purchase.
B000CIZZR8|4|I only give this four stars for the following reason.  They have to be replaced periodically.  The first set I purchased lasted about three years, though I could have replaced them after two.  After a few trips through the car was they tend to bend and bow.  You can straighten this out by hand in most instances, but after some time they just start to look trashy.<br /><br />When they are brand new, it is a must have on your truck.  They really do make your vehicle stand out from the others.  Especially if you have a lot of factory chrome on your truck.
B0006IX87S|5|Works great
B00PB7TIGO|5|very cool very clean. 2nd day riding a truck with sand got in front of me and now I have a bunch of chips on my shield now. sucks,
B00FEBUYWY|5|Awesome
B00E5PK8TE|5|Put it in bike fired right up.
B00RORVU5Q|5|Works perfect in my new toyota highlander 2015 .
B0036D61F6|5|Great helmet
B0010E7OB8|1|beware that your seatbelt must be single pass.  My Lexus is300 is double pass and therefore I had to return item because it will not work.  So, I wasted my time and some money on this.
B0030HUFCI|5|Arrived Quickly and was exactly what I expected.  Used on 1996 Merc 200HP.  Instructions are a little vague so if using on Mercury (sending unit is your brown w/white stripe wire)
B00MJDWJX2|5|I fitted the product to my Lincoln Navigator today and it is as good as the expensive competition. I had some 3M activator that I used and before applying that I wiped the contact area first with a wet cloth then with Alcohol and let it dry. I applied the activator on both surfaces and with my wife's help, the job was done in 20 minutes including the electric roof deflector. In all the quality is good at a decent price. I hope they include some alcohol wipe pads in the future but you can use rubbing alcohol.
B00BPHOC6A|5|These make my RV look sharp and clean!  When I bought new tires for my rig I found out that 16.5 inch tires were a thing of the past so I had to buy all new 16&#34; wheels as well as tires.  This left me with wheel covers that no longer fit my vintage RV.  I found these on Amazon.com and the price was fantastic...and they looked exactly like to ones I had to toss.  Well made...easy to install...and I foresee no issues with them in the future.
B00FKP6QSK|3|Cups don't stay in holder sunglasses fall out over price for the item sorry
B00OO16CUS|5|great
B009UYNMWK|5|Fitment was on point and the color was also perfect. Easy install. Made my s13 dash like new!
B0075D10KO|5|WORKED LIKE A CHARM FOR MY 2002 EXPLORER
B000P58DMC|5|This was the final component for the tune-up/mild performance upgrade for my 2000 Explorer 4.0 SOHC. I used NGK wires and Iridium IX plugs, along with a K&N intake. Overall I've gained maybe 1-2 mpg over stock, but there's definitely more go power throughout the RPM range.
B00EQQIUGK|5|Get rid of the stock air intake they haven't designed or engineered anything at the factory as good as the k&n cold air intake , I've been using k&n products since the 70s there are others out there but k&n is the best.i put them on every thing I own!!
B00EQ1IOS4|5|Highly recommended every one should own this kit
B0000AY4YX|5|Great product
B00GI78D76|5|Lights up the cab great! Bright! You can see without a problem when dark. it light turning on a light switch in your house as soon as you open your door in your truck. Great product!!
B00G0PQPL2|5|one the way to go
B0008F68MG|5|as described and fast ship
B0055DQ2RC|5|Nice locks quick delivery
B000IY4BIK|5|Very pleased with these rotors. Centric pads & rotors are major upgrade from OEM. Great Value!
B003EOZLEO|5|2015 Jeep Wrangler unlimited.  I put these on in 30 minutes with a ratchet and one wrench.  I believe 10mm wrench and 13mm and 14mm ratchet.  product fit perfectly.  No drilling or grinding or anything like stated in other reviews.  It would be easier with two sets of hands, but i did it by myself.  They look awesome and are very sturdy.  Putting new front bumper on tomorrow.
B00KY0D6X4|5|A great product at a great price, Thank you
B00514AMMQ|5|Nice fit just right
B001B45BFI|5|great product fast shipping
B00480BWCI|5|just what we needed for our camping trips.
B00G6KZNM8|5|Perfect fit but up here in the north I sand and paint with 1200 ° paint before install it will make it last longer lots of salt in north east ohio
B0078U8GIS|1|It's the inner tie rod only.
B0042XORMI|5|Thanks for the great item.
B000C4AQNA|1|When the MAFS arrived, it was not securely packed in the box.  It did not look re-manufactured - only painted.  There was rust still on the collar for the adjustment screw and the terminals were dark - not even clean.  I put an ohm meter to test the specs - according to the factory service manual it should test 3.5 to 4.0.  It read 2.6.<br /><br />I called both tech support and customer service at Cardone.  They told me they did not sell products on Amazon.com - even though I tried to convince them that it was in fact, their store.  They were no help whatsoever.<br /><br />Thankfully Amazon takes back defective products easily.  I would not recommend purchase of this product.
B00267PZUK|5|Worked great. Great design And it's heavy duty.
B002DQHHPU|1|I would have sent this back if not for the trouble of doing so.  It was very cheap for the price of it.  The manufacturing quality and materials are poor and the stingray emblem is off center.
B0019J5E3E|5|Verry  nice
B000XRHRZQ|5|They fit beautifully!
B00W566NZ8|5|Bright!!!!
B001JT1CEE|5|I keep an extra package on hand because it is so handy. For LED lights, relay trigger, or any application were the current isn't very high.
B002669TU8|5|Old one was toast and making car overheat. New one is Direct fit plug and play works great no more overheating!<br />2003 Honda Civic LX sedan

B00CX9JH14|5|Worked great
B004Q3OEV8|1|This wasn't worth the money.  They wouldn't stay on at all.
B0031AWJZK|5|Arrived on time. love them
B00EQ01Q58|5|love led lights
B0055EALW8|5|Great price of a brand name item.  Most people do not change tranny fluid often enough.  After internal filter changing, refilling and then adding more oil during first 25 seconds running, it pumped out old oil by the cooler line.  Thus, I flushed the torque converter considerable too.  Most of us need 3 gallons for this.  And last but not least, I put a filter into the cooler line.
B00BFE6QQM|5|Part worked perfectly.  Plug and play, no programing need.  Fast shipping.  Thanks.
B007RNYEYQ|4|Great quality a little better than OEM stock pads.
B000COVZ08|1|Bought 4 of these October 2014 for my 2006 Dodge Ram Mega Cab 2500 5.9L 4x4. I put these on at 50k miles seeking to improve the ride and reduce side to side sway. It did not work. Very soft shocks. Worse than the Stock shock I took off.  not recommend these to anyone. Not to mention Monroe did not send me the rebate 4 for price of 3 after sending in all the required documentation.  Im getting these off and  spend the money and get the Bilstein shocks.
B00B2YE4B4|4|2 out of 4 worked.  The two that work are great, I just put them in so let's see how long they last.
B001URVKS8|3|The gloves are a bit tight and bulky when you get them, but seem to relax after a bit of use.
B0016IT3YE|5|The first one that showed up was not made properly so did not fit the application seller quickly sent me a new one which fit and works great
B00RRBP46U|4|A little more on the orange side than amber, so don't exactly match my other exterior lights, and not nearly as bright as the white Sirius bulbs, but not bad!
B00I250MIU|5|Awesome product.
B004L38AL8|5|Beautiful faucet, works great !
B00AC6Y9S6|5|This is a nicely made, large, durable looking tail bag with a number of good features. It has an insertable front plastic panel to maintain its shape; removed, it will fold flat for storage. The main bag and two side pockets are all expandable; the inside lid has a mesh pocket, cell phone pocket, and pen/pencil/tool loops. When expanded,  It can hold my large XXL full face helmet with face shield, visor, and GoPro attachment. It has a carrying handle and shoulder strap for use as regular luggage, or for carrying off the bike. There are two bottom flaps which when let down, offer two more side pockets with velcro openings. Even the rain cover is expandable for the bag when it is at full size.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product I'm buying another for my mother. The free gift is great too.
B000HE6H3S|5|Nice strong hose, and the good Hayden brand. No strings attached.
B001O0HOK4|1|They stripped my lug nuts and made my wheel come off donor use on a dodge stratus
B000R8F47Y|5|Works great for the price. The cargo net specifically for my vehicle was $90 - this was an unbeatable price. Because you can attach the hooks anywhere along the length, it will fit any truck bed. Actually, being too large for my truck's bed is an advantage as I can compartmentalize what I'm carrying. The buyer that said you should store the hooks separately was a life saver. It is much easier to use if you store it with the hooks detached. There is one negative: when you take it out,of the box it has a strong chemical odor so you don't want to leave this inside your house for very long. Keep it outside. I'm assuming that odor will go away over time. It's a real stinker.
B005MZWZJC|5|Looks good in the center of my pickup tailgate, larger than most I have seen.
B004HIHBBC|5|The pully cover was perfect.
B00BAZBXTG|5|Looked great and was on time
B0006IX850|5|works well for cleanIng the black tank in our RV
B000KL1ECM|1|Terrible car mat.  Even though I got the exact model designed for my specific made/model/year car, it didn't fit exactly.<br /><br />But the worst part is the top of the mat is so slipper, my foot continually slipped around and I had to constantly adjust to keep my foot on the accelerator/brake.  It's very unsafe and scary.<br /><br />And the slipperiness makes it uncomfortable when you're on cruise control, and you'd like to have your legs at a different angle, you can't have your legs at any angle but straight out, because your feet slip so much.  So there's no way to adjust to make your drive more comfortable.<br /><br />I returned them, hoping to get a refund (company threatened they won't refund me, since I'd used the mats for two days).  I just ordered carpet-like mats again, like I'd had for my entire car-driving history, which I'm sure will be better than these very awful mats.
B000CB3X4W|1|did not fit at all

B00DPHM7XI|1|Very mad right now Bc a few months ago I bought the 42$ SPPC third brake light.  N jus recently it stopped burning on one side.  So I said Mayb it was jus Bc it was so cheap.  So il jus buy a better more expensive one like (ANZO) !!!!!! Well it was 90$. And I received it today and it is identical to the SPPC one. Even on the back and inside.  So I'm pissed.  It's a scam.
B001KSGF14|5|When using my blinkers, my hazards would come on (intermittently).  Sometimes going back and forth on the stalk helped, and lots of times not.  Driving in traffic, and land changes became a little difficult.<br /><br />This was easy to swap.  All I had to do was remove some dash paneling, jerk the existing module back and forth, off of the rear of the fuse block, and replace.<br /><br />It's been at least 2 weeks, and the blinkers work as they should!
B00L7XH9D0|5|fit perfectly on my 2002 f150 and my 2005  f350 6.0 diesel. I think they look great and are an upgrade from the factory housing. These took all of 10 minutes to install. They snapped in and were srcewed into place just like the stock housing. Make sure you are getting the right part for your vehicle. Some people said they had to modify but that should not be the case with these. If you have to modify check your order. These were an exact match.
B007KLMNNE|5|installed very easily and solved the ridiculous loose bulb socket problem that comes with an e36 bmw. this also comes with a very standard bulb size so replacing bulbs with aftermarket led types would be a snap! rubber seal seems to make a better seal than factory as well
B008CL49P6|5|On time as advertised..
B00TWF0KXG|5|Awesome!!
B00PG2QA1K|3|it was not what look at .will use it as a side table
B000KOTXSQ|4|works great. I use it mostly in saltwater. If it is still functioning this well in 2 or 3 years I'll give it the 5th star
B00F23BNUG|5|Very bright, Can mow the lawn at midnight if I want!
B00CFALFXY|5|I have tried so many eyeglass cleaners - and nothing is very good.  Well there was nothing to lose by trying these.  I used ONLY my breath for moisture, dried with the VibraWipe - and - these did a better job than anything I have tried!!
B000GZNB1E|5|As always, Motion Pro makes top quality products at a great price point.
B00DSMEL2A|5|Contents had smash on it. Most likely in the shipping process. Lost a 1/4 of the chemical. But product is good.
B00LSTO6UM|4|Covered my 34 foot trailer with about 2 feet to spare so it so long enough to cover the hitch too. Reinforced at the rain gutters. Good deal, just what I needed.
B00PFFG1EO|2|Nice device, but since it is wifi enabled, it blocks cell phone data - eg.. if you use this device, you can't use features like google maps. Essentially useless for me on long drives unless I have a phone dedicated just for this device which doens't make sense.
B00OQPRPK8|3|just seems very small & shoddy, (& likely to shift & swing around) theres better options
B005EUYN7M|5|Looks great and applied easily
B000LG5YUY|5|as expected
B00802EYVQ|5|Awesome HID headlights. Great looking on my Honda Pilot 2007. The price makes it a must buy.
B005F64SR0|1|Inflator did not read accurate, and air chuck was hard to use returned and opted for the blue point version.
B00062YSHS|5|Just call this an inexpensive way to keep from getting drips under your car.  Just swap out the gasket when you change the oil and don't over tighten and you should be fine.
B0050NB8Z8|5|I love this head liner being made of ABS plastic its so much easier to clean and dont burn as easy compered to the cloth ones. I was able to custom fit it right over the original one and not lose the R-Value but gain a little more.
B000R5IASC|4|Seems to do the job.
B002K2FS8K|3|This is exactly what I wanted. Thanks! Came as described and shipped fast! BUT.... I wish it would have lasted longer than one winter before holes were rubbed in to it.
B00SYGN518|4|This is a true dual exhaust system and  sounds really nice.
B007PLQYXO|5|good product.
B0083RA4YE|2|Sticker is of good quality and was made of the material I was looking for however the product dimensions stated in the description are misleading.<br />Actual sticker dimensions are 3-1/8&#34; X 2-7/16&#34;.
B00A0R015M|5|These clips worked perfectly  to hook up our camper sway bar.
B00KUBKUQ8|3|I used it to spray some old ski belts that had cracks or small holes. Dried for a week. Most of it washed off the first time we went swimming.
B0027UMVQC|5|Stock fairlead that came with my winch had bolt hole pattern that did not line up with (KFI) mounting plate without some modification which I didn't want to do. This is a heavier fairlead than the stock and the upgrade was well worth it.
B00CNI1SDA|5|This stuff is amazing! this couch is 20 years old I used this stuff for the first time today and I couldn't be more impressed this is so amazing! It does make it a little darker which was what I was looking for but let me say wow!
B0028R1IHW|5|Thanks
B000B66UUW|5|Exactly as advertised, fit perfectly
B00RH13OEE|5|The best!
B0031BSNE0|5|I hesitated buying this seat given that I had no way to compare it with other aftermarket seats for the DR650. But after numerous numb-assed hour long rides on my new bike I took the plunge and bought this one. If I had it to do over again I would buy this seat on the same day I bought my DR. It's far more comfortable and road vibration is hardly even felt. It feels like I'm riding a smooth street bike instead of a thumper. And after long rides, I'm still feeling like I could continue - I never felt that way with the stock seat.<br /><br />An excellent improvement to the DR.
B000PLV37S|5|Perfect fit for Toro brand string trimmer too!
B005OCF8Q0|3|Three Accent lights were out right out of the box as you can see, but looked very good and were quite bright, the headlights were nothing special, there was a cut around the + wire that revealed the wire inside (which is not safe), they worked fine like stock ones from any brand bike. but the reason i am returning these is the accent lights and the fact that the circuitry boards were not protected from water at the sides, no cover or nothing the moment i run this through a puddle, water and mud and dirt has easy access to the circuit boards. i am not comfortable with that thought.
B00CFALFXY|4|Seem to be of a better quality microfiber fabric. Have not had a chance to use them or wash them yet. Like the pretty colors !
B00IKIWRTG|5|Its the best struts I've ever put on my car.
B0065722SU|1|Does not fit the bike it said it would.
B0018MITR0|2|it did what it said to small
B002E1AYKY|5|Worked perfectly today to hold up my minivan as I changed the brakes and rotors. I had no concerns with the vehicle's stability or my safety.
B00I50553E|5|Truck looks good. Easy to install. I feel like I'm at least 10% more cool than I was before.
B005HMOSSG|5|I these via this this link - http://www.shareyourrepair.com/2015/03/how-to-replace-2004-2010-toyota-sienna-dome-lights-with-LED-bulbs.html  when I was looking to fix my other van.  I am glad he has that link to help explain which bulbs go where.  The bulbs come without any instructions on which bulbs go where.  The only downside that I can find is that the bulbs for the vanity mirrors don't fit.
B005F5LM3O|5|Fast shipping and works great!
B004BXJ3FU|1|Did not fit Honda Civic Coupe
B00OVV0ZHC|5|Fast shipping and better quality than my mac socket
B000FPXV5G|4|Fits okay, rubs park brake handle. Nice to have cupholders!
B00TQU83X6|3|Nice looking, but no tape to apply to my car? Not real happy
B00NFSNAS8|5|handy little item, also portable and works from lighter/wall socket
B004I0HI4O|5|GREAT PRICE.GREAT QUALITY.
B003XFTUHI|5|looks pretty cool on the car
B00U9N3S5M|3|The shield itself is quality. It does bow a bit when you pick up speed. We deal with gravel. So with the windshield on and vents open we get lots of dust. Vents allow a good amount of air in.  Saw dust was an issue in other reviews and didn't think it would be a big deal, but it is for me.  Less dust without a windshield. Half windshield may have been a good deal for summer. Keeps bugs off great. Was a bit tough to get on. We have the Polaris snap on top and no back windshield. The windshield does what it's supposed to do and helps keep rain and bugs off and helps so your eyes don't take on the wind. I'm sure we'll appreciate it even more in the winter when we aren't getting hit with as much cold air while driving.
B004P9ADJU|5|Good
B00V4477ES|1|cheap to much extra black boarder and makes it look over sized
B00BC06SJO|5|Excellent
B001G4Z5J0|5|super awesome. nice and heavy. one issue i had is with amazon recommending the light set that has a small issue when trying to install some turn lights on the back side. no stars taken away for this issue
B00EJW02WQ|5|Pisses off who it should piss off! Love it!
B000WJX3R6|5|Lasted me all season. Will adjust review based on how well it works into next season.
B00BRM88WC|5|perfect
B008U159TI|5|It came fast in the mail it was a perfect match to my old one and its works great.
B005QUK72U|1|Too complicated to stick on the window
B00D1CQUHQ|5|Great light! I've been using it on logging roads and trails in the Pacific Northwest and it is phenomenal. Makes driving late at night much safer, and helps spot the wildlife well before it enters the roadway.
B000J3ZVU2|5|Fits perfect and works great!
B00J3N90WY|3|excellent
B004XCW0WC|1|completely wrong bearing for the application,bearing looks good ,box was beat up pretty good though ,still the wrong part
B003O1BOWU|5|fit like a charm but why they don't come with the lift support arms baffles me to this day
B00BWM0UNC|5|Excellent in ease of installation, fit and finish. But most importantly was the sound from Axle back install, not too loud on highway but a perfect low bass rumble as you tool around at lower speeds.<br />It pays to view YouTube examples and listen for what your after. This what the SRT8 Dodge 2013 has been missing for two years. Worth every cent. Jeff
B00JA0PJSE|5|Exactly as advertised
B00KPP6GTY|4|Install easy. Great operation. Hook that it comes with is just a bit big, but better safe than sorry. Got the neoprene cover to keep it clean
B00U5OKH22|5|Great for the price and a snap to put on
B000630AQA|5|Does a very adequate job with minimal time and effort.  I just spray it on the wheels and rinse with a hose.  In severe cases, brake dust can be removed with a wheel brush, but for between complete washes, this is a great product.
B00LGDRBC0|5|Very nice
B00OLZ3CZA|4|I really like the shirt but wish it had something on the front that made it stand out as a Cadillac shirt. The symbol in the back is small. Needs another on the sleeve or front.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|I used this on the handles of a brown leather bag and it did a good job of cleaning them.  I also greatly appreciated the follow up by customer service to see if I was satisfied with the product.
B006TMK6KM|4|A good part and reasonably priced.
B0010DW608|5|OEM replacement for my EVO X.. no complaints. No weird initial smell.s
B00C4YRGQQ|4|Very solid
B00649Q1QI|1|Seat covers fell apart within the first month, and yes they were properly installed.  Steering wheel cover won't fit unless I tear it. Overall huge disappointment.
B0077DM22C|5|Shipped super fast! Great customer service! And worked great had to change my idle and throtle to push instead of screwed but that was a minor fix and nothing to blame on there part. Would highly recommend them to a friend.
B00A2DVUJU|4|Great cover!  Love the straps so I can adjust the fit.  The material is great and the whole cover went on quickly.  Would definitely recommend this cover!
B0002Z9R5W|5|Ignore the negative reviews for not fitting the vehicle. It's your job to check the size and you can easily cross reference with the PIAA site(2016-PIAA-Wiper-Application-Guide.pdf).<br /><br />These are amazing. I was worried they wouldn't fit properly due to the thickness on refills. These are driver 8mm.They go to 6mm on the passenger side and the rear.<br /><br />They fit the 2015 Sorento perfectly on the OEM. Clean amazing. If these even last a year they are worth it.
B00F3FGWSQ|4|The cover is same shape as the air filter and fits over air intake but is a little too wide. This causes the factory screw to be a little short to get the cover tight enough to be confident no water will get in. I am over all happy with the product.
B001LHVOVK|5|My car has over 300,000 miles on it. Now I know what it is thinking
B008H6ZHYS|5|as expected
B00NJ9MZH0|1|Useless as a source of projected beam. False power rating. Metered at 7w max. Could not adjust it to fall within reflector focus point.<br /><br />In other words, do not buy if you are looking for light projection. It may serve as day running light only.
B00V3XFFE4|5|Everything as described.
B00NX8EYFI|5|Good deal. Fast shipping
B009R566KW|5|Great price and easy swap.  2008 Mazda 6 S.
B000S2SKIY|4|Did the job
B00FS2TL8W|5|Good fit and price!
B00D4NECJA|5|Perfect for the right person.  I saw it on my preacher's wife's car and gave it to my friend on her 90th birthday.  She LOVED it.
B00OZ12NSW|5|THE BEST PIPES PIPING MY 2012 R1!!!!
B000X21YRI|1|unable to return product for credit
B0085FOFXU|4|made the truck look alot newer. pain in the ass to adjust tho
B000KV8KJ2|5|Weather tech, is there anything else that needs to be said!
B009LN4YH2|4|It's good item.
B00B9GFMXE|5|Very pleased. It comes with two and bc I didnt read the description I was surprised and excited
B00D3YEGO6|5|Ordered this product as a surprise for my sisters 70th birthday. She absolutely loved it!! It was NOT a disappointment.  It was very well made and presented beautifully in its gift box.  I'm sure she will get many years of enjoyment out of it and many compliments too.  Now I need to order one for myself!
B006A2WLYA|5|Love it. It was for my 2000 ford ranger. Very easy to install. Only took me about 5 minutes
B00KTIYXLU|3|One keeps stopping to worl
B00BCRMBGQ|1|Wasn't very impressed I don't like the zippers on the seat covers
B0091EZM18|4|Very study and easily holds my Triumph Speed Triple without any hint of falling.  The only problem is that the assembly instructions are very minimal and some of the pre-drilled holes didn't line up exactly.  Took longer to put together than planned.
B004SFY59U|3|Works, but not a very good &#34;feel&#34; to the valve action which made it possible to apply too much pressure on the charging port schrader valves thereby damaging the springs on said valves necessitating replacement of the valve cores immediately after service work. When I wear out these I will get the genuine Robinair couplers.
B00T0TYXGY|5|Great looking stickers, easy to apply, and appear very well made.
B00LWH682E|5|Gooooood
B00ISGKXY6|1|Supreme Suspension contacted me in regards to my previous review. Customer service repeatedly told me a manager would contact me back and never did. One lady from customer service offered me a free tshirt for a refund for my troubles after they wrote in a letter offering partial payment refund!!!! Customer services is horrible and rude this product will not fit your Silverado even though company states it does and has been verified by theor &#34;QC&#34; Team.     Purchased for my 2014 Silverado 1500 and u bolts were not threaded and had to use a rethreading kit for both bolts and nuts. Block did not fit and had to drill out pin hole and grinned down lower pin by 1/8 inch to fit flush. Should have been a quick hour project but took almost 4 hours due to product imperfections! After adjustments made truck looks great with a 3 front leveling kit and 2 inch rear block lift.
B000IZ1MZY|2|I changed them because they were rusty and these got rusty in 3 weeks
B00K6DN2YM|5|I had to grind the right front bracket a little but that stainless steel running board is well worth it.
B00BZVYM98|5|I want sure it would work, but got it anyway and it worked perfect, us it was easy to set up.
B005149YXE|1|These are not 1&#34; but more like .94 inches, and will not fit on a 1&#34; crash bar.  Kuryakyn customer service was great and after I returned these to Amazon.  I ordered directly from Kuryakyn, just in case Amazon had a bad batch.  The clamps from the manufacture were also .94&#34;.  Customer service again was excellent and even went to the warehouse to check a pair down there.  He got the same measurements.
B003YMTJ5S|5|Great brand. Great Price. Got to my home fast. Would recommend this product and seller.
B00B8HN1GO|5|Fits great
B00BVPOC20|5|Works perfectly for my 2004 honda accord
B00U2COE7G|5|Great at what it's supposed to do, protecting your eyes from glare when the Sun is in that position between the visor and setting. Love it, I seem to have to drive at just that time and really needed this.
B00D6YIKDQ|5|I love them.  easy to install, should have a small verticle crease so the front window guards can be adheared just past where the window slides up on the door
B00EE1FEPW|4|the bed covers no longer falls down because of these things and they are strong, well made...only get 4 stars because it does not come with the ball joints and nuts, which need to be bought separately.
B00CI9F67S|5|as described
B000EH4V18|5|it is great
B007QBSZ8U|5|On time and worked great.
B003NWV6SC|5|Great replacement, comes from the same factory as OEM for less.
B00R5IU8RU|3|Hey!!!!!!! slow but I got it!!!!!!!
B00INF8DY4|5|These are great mats for a great price. Excellent quality !
B005I4K5D0|5|Worked great, update in technology from original.
B003BZ7ME8|1|Very dissatisfied with this purchase. Bought it to replace my flowmaster 40 series on my 2005 Silverado 5.3L and also spent $55 on extra piping to accommodate the smaller size and there is absolutely no difference in the sound of the two mufflers. Sounds stock at idle and makes a little bit of noise going down the road but overall a bad purchase.
B00KAPLT64|2|I order in black and received in a different color. Dont like it.
B00B8LQQVM|4|I recently bought the driver and passenger side axles from GKN because I was developing a really bad click while turning in my jetta.  It was cheaper to buy both and install them myself than it would be to have just the one problematic side replaced.  This axle appears to be new and not a regrind, but I'm honestly not 100% it was a new axle.  Importantly, though, my ride is now much quieter and I saved a boatload of money purchasing through amazon.
B006GJLENQ|5|Very solid, very easy installation of you have the right equipment. would recommend.
B00LPIA3T4|5|For the price this can not be beat! Ive been using it to repair phones, drones and other electronics.
B005EHNU8S|5|Good, I'm very happy about it
B00VUH8HS4|1|The most crapiest product I've ever received in my entire life the sticker was smashed wrinkled had tears. the whole entire thing is trash DO NOT ORDER!
B007ZLKJCG|5|Fit perfect.
B00HDT08D0|5|Cool
B00AEH4PP0|5|Perfect
B00JOY6U7U|5|Rock solid quality product. cables are thicker than expected. Clips are very high quality and Cigarette lighter adapter is of strong and well built.
B0023VBIXM|5|Very satisfied with the whole experience! Dealer wanted $265.
B00R15MJNI|5|Love it, application was easy and product was of excellent quality.
B00J49V4R6|4|smaller than factory but gets the job done wonderfully!
B003YKC74A|5|Nice heavy duty Mounting Kit.  great Price and very simple and easy install.
B0022ZHYMI|5|Fits perfect works great.  100% satisfied.  Just don't buy the chrome fuel shut off &#34;cover&#34; as it doesn't fit the Honda,  and I had to bend and cut it to get it on.  Total junk.
B004HOJWB8|5|thanks
B005PZMLDY|2|loose fitting and not very good for a nissan maxima and not very good quality
B00E6KU3CA|5|Very pleased with fast delivery and quality of product
B00BWAPLXS|5|Great fit for 2002 Bmw 325i, just remember to not unplug air bag or it will set off a air bag code that cost about 100.00 to reset
B00BN2T334|5|Charges my Duracell 600 and Wager 300 perfectly. They also sent me a replacement adaptor tip when I broke the original one. Great customer service for a great product.
B005V1DG8G|5|Exactly what i expected
B00466V9AY|5|This connected to my F-250 quickly, has great range and a perfect price.
B008F8Q92C|1|Do not like them. They were broken when I got them. I had to use parts from my old ones to fix them. Very disappointed.
B00M78820I|4|It does its job.  More convenient and economical than purchasing through the dealership.
B00REZN10A|4|Could fit better but it works! I like the kidney belt too
B000BZI4JS|5|Bosch is awesome
B002FY3ZR4|5|Just put in today, exact replacement we'll see how long it holds up..
B0050OX07Q|3|They are &#34;just OK&#34;. They work just fine, fit the 1156 socket just fine, but could be brighter. I installed them in my John Deere garden tractor as replacements for the 1156 incandescent headlight bulbs. I bought a couple 1156 leds off the shelf at wal-mart. They are brighter then these. Now to be completely fair, the wallyworld leds are $14. These are $5. These leds are also very short, like 60% of the length of a normal 1156 incandescent bulb.
B0006PSCYK|1|Wedge cushion did not fit the bucket seats in my car. Plus it was too firm.
B000BHNZRM|5|Solid tool
B000DINKPQ|5|Loud, and fits Victory motorcycles, plug and play.  L
B00JWWD9AU|4|Overall, another happy customer here. Although the product was missing a large bolt at the end of one of the control arms (an extremely important part not to have!)
B000E4TSWS|5|great product
B005ES2WLI|2|Is this really WeatherTech? Really? I regret buying this for my 2015 Honda Odyssey EX-L.<br /><br />I bought from WeatherTech's web site to ensure a perfect match. I bought the over the hump one (the front seat space in between the two seats are connected and covered). They sent a confirmation email upon order, but no tracking emails or shipment notification.<br />Maybe I read too many 5 star reviews, but I was not happy with this product overall.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  1) Too THIN and this is essentially a hard shell type of liner. no wonder it is called liner, not mat. It is not comfortable to touch, not pleasant to look at, and not good to step on. I was expecting a somewhat soft and thick rubber - what a mistake.<br />  2) Looks cheap. The pattern looks just okay on the web site, but looks cheap and not pleasing in person.<br />  3) Durability is doubtful. Because of the feel of the material and how thin it is. Maybe it will last, but I just don't have confidence in it.<br />  4) Expensive. It is $100 more than the OEM all-weather floor mat. Granted, this is a liner, with more coverage. However I can imagine the all weather floor mat would be thicker and not as hard.<br />  5) Putting in the second and third row piece (one piece) was a bit painful - I had to take out all second row seats. It is not a deal breaker, but in light of the poor and thin &#34;liner&#34; I had to handle and install, I was not happy.<br />  6) The black color shows dirt and dust very very easy. If you buy, please consider buying gray or tan, no matter what your interior color is.<br />  7) No cushion at all since I removed the carpet mats. Did I mention it is thin? :-(<br /><br />Pros:<br />  1) Fits very well, kind of like a glove (albeit a very thin one).<br />  2) Cannot think of anything else. Oh well, better protective coverage than a all-weather mat. However have I mentioned that it is too thin?<br /><br />Advice to you:<br />  1) If you live in a state or area where there is snow in the winter or you can bring dirt or mud into the vehicle often, you may consider this liner. Other wise, I strongly suggest you consider the all-weather mat. Even WeatherTech's own all-weather mats are very good. I know if because I bought their all-weather mats for my other Sedan, and I love it much much better - very thick, feel soft and flexible, and stay in place because of the little spike below.<br />  2) If thinking of taking out the three second-row seats pain you, then don't buy this.<br />  3) If you want your feet to rest on a bit of soft and cushioned mat, don't buy this.<br />  4) If you just want to experiment with this &#34;liner&#34; type of product, you may try it at your own risk of buyer's remorse.<br /><br />I don't want to return it because it is a hassle to take out the middle piece.<br /><br />Please view my pictures which should help you make your decisions.in the winter or you can bring dirt or mud into the vehicle often, you may consider this liner.

B007USCM7E|4|Easy & Quick fix.
B0063GKHPI|3|This product does the job.  However, it could be improved.<br />The positives: Plenty of restoration solution.  Easily could cover 4 headlights.  Brush applicator is better than other kits that provide cloth/gloves.<br />The negatives: Sandpaper.  Not enough.  Other kits (more expensive) provide foam backed sandpaper that is much easier to handle and do an even job
B00ANZW28U|5|Works well!
B00HDT08D0|5|Awsome
B000C91FJE|3|I'm not sure how I feel about this muffler....I thought stainless steel meant that it would not rust so fast.  It's already rusting on the plate that the tailpipes go into.  I certainly paid stainless steel price!
B000IG3QNY|1|Horrible. Only one light works...impossible to open. Would never waste money on this item again.
B00LPWF0AC|1|This was waste of money. It doesn't do the job for which it is advertised.
B0001ZPY0K|5|Great Product easy to install
B000BXMF4A|4|At first I thought the spring steel band was too stiff but then when I tried it on an oil filter it was OK.
B000A8JNF0|4|works were nothing else does
B008KZKIO0|5|Exactly what I wanted and needed.  Made car interior look new!
B009FKWTO6|5|Fit as advertised
B00XC4HJO6|5|Nice lights
B000GU1PL2|5|just the right height for my 2006 street glide ,blocks most of the wind but can still see over it but still looks sporty!
B00CMX20H4|4|Seems like a well engineered, quality product at a reasonable price.  Down side--needed a magnifying glass to read instructions.
B007HRUW2K|5|Expensive but worth it. Well built and designed. The perfect solution for installation of a 32&#34; Flat screen TV in an existing AV cabinet in the fifth wheel. Comes in two heights. After some measuring I decided on the shorter one. Fits perfectly and provides the right amount of adjustment to pull out and swivel if desired.
B001UFRVO2|5|This was a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking to improve the handling of their truck.  It fit my 2008 Ranger without difficulty.  The driver's side was a bit tricky due to the gas tank but woth an extra long box-end wrench not a big deal.  This made a very noticeable Improvement and the truck is much more stable. Thank you Amazon.
B00MMWA0GI|5|extra parts i need
B000WK4ESW|5|Nice for quick clean-ups
B000OCF8NI|5|Good brush.  I use it in my showers.
B001FOLMXO|5|Did a great job covering minor scratches on my car.
B000TXSF6E|5|Great product looks fantastic
B00U8RP7T4|4|Very good for removing all types of interior trim pieces. This material bends more then expected, but has not broken. I would buy again.
B00DMTTSIQ|5|really great coverage in back which was main concern.  front is very complete too!  I wish they covered the middle in the front, but should keep things dry and clean.  2015 silverado crew cab
B0081W8VR8|5|Great camera. A little misleading in the fact that it does not come with the bezel and you have to cut a hole in the existing bezel but the camera is great. It would be better if the finish was not gloss black, more of a textured flat black would match the stock bezel better. But other than the above, great inexpensive camera for an aftermarket in dash setup
B00FSDMALQ|5|Good
B003MXFD4K|5|Arrived a day early. Fit perfectly. Truck is running a needle cooler.
B000JZZA2E|5|worked perfectly ... perfect  fit and sound
B00MPQ3CZ2|5|The right product at a good price.  Does the job very well. Would recmmend to others and buy again if the need arises.
B00A7ZO900|2|Mainly its not the frame i dont like, its the size and placement. If you have a state that has its tags on the bottom this frame will cover them up. Its a great product if your in a state that has its tags up top.
B007Y85XLC|4|Very good price for this starter compared to competition. Installed and working fine.
B0022137YQ|5|You guys are the best you made a license plate for me a while back everyone loves it and wants one.<br /><br />Thank You
B00B9HHT0M|1|These are STICKERS not decals.
B00POG2D5U|5|very cute
B000B8JUNY|2|In spite of Amazon's assurances that it fits, it doesn't.  Fits the filler neck fine but it's too high to close the filler door.  You can grind the top down enough to fit but that's a PITA.
B00LH1N8J6|5|Was happy with them, zero issues. Better quality than most leds I've bought on here, and they have a cooling fan (if that matters).  I had no flickering problems or burn out issues, had them in the car 11 months as high beams. The color is the same as a 5000k hid, looks cool. Are they light years brighter than a regular halogen high beam, I would say no. Are they dimmer than a standard halogen high beam, absolutely not. Cool color, quality product. I've spend the money on cheaper items and been disappointed with them burning out quick. Just buy these, they're worth it.
B00GKQLAS4|5|great product fast shipping
B0068ODC1Q|3|No instructions included when received the item
B00BZO4KAQ|5|Fit a 1980 El Camino front end. Easy to use for all vehicles.
B00KTJ1N0I|5|This product was awesome. When I received it. I was able to use my car alarm right away.
B0089FGCVY|5|Feel very well made, and are very comfortable. Fit very well
B00XK77A8A|5|item works perfect to protect arm rest on new truck
B000BXOFJI|5|Great product. Works well
B00O6T0LRS|5|Sleek and small, perfect fit and looks amazing.
B00NT0ZYRW|3|The license plate frame is fine, but the chrome caps are very cheaply made.  They are too small and don't work on the bolts that were sent from the factory.  Why couldn't they have just sent along the chrome bolts to begin with as that is what I was lead to believe would come with it.
B004GEIQAW|4|Good product
B00LG07MZE|5|Everything was as expected. No problems at all.
B00LQHR9GE|5|Bright and well constructed solid product and awesomely priced
B000N3W8J0|5|Great idea - have found it handy for other garden / garage washing projects aside from the car.
B00DZY439M|3|They are good.
B00FH7WN2Y|5|I used this switch to replace a main power amplifier switch. With limited modifications to the front panel of the amp, the switch fit nicely and function as well as the original at a substantial cost savings. I am completely satisfied and would highly recommend this switch for similar applications.
B00EI6CKVE|5|tired of the usual??? get this :)
B00SH1SN6C|1|It can't hold charge more than 1 day after two months of owning it.
B000C02MD6|1|does not fir 2008 honda accord coupe EX
B000EEQ9MK|5|works good
B00M78820I|2|IT DOESNT FIT THE WINDSHIELD OF MY HONDA CIVIC COUPE 2008, WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT IS JUMBO SIZE BUT ONLY FITS HORIZONTALLY AND NOT VERTICALLY. 35% OF MY WINSHIELD IS UNPROTECTED.
B000EQR7XS|5|Works great - perfect fit
B0024GQI9K|5|Love it
B000CO7XP4|5|Awesome shocks for the price!<br />Installed easily on my 91 Corvette.<br />I'd buy again!
B004EIAADG|5|Quality build and has been used on 10+ cars at least.  Everyone that uses it asks where I got it and talks about getting one.
B004A52ZWM|5|As expected from acdelco....great quality !!!!
B00230KLQ8|5|Worked as advertised. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
B00HYJCO4U|1|Horrible lights. Didn't work when plug it and felt really cheap. Cheaper than $1
B000C2GGF4|5|Top Shelf better than OE .
B000UKBE28|5|works perfect on late model gas cans which all need vents
B005KOZ25Y|5|This scanner has worked well for me.  I have used it extensively with our 2005 Honda Pilot.  It has also worked well on a colleague's Toyota (don't remember the exact model).  It reads codes and clears them (just so nobody gets the wrong idea, if you haven't fixed the problem, your check engine light will eventually come back on).  It also supports live data, so you can plug it in, start up your car, and get some live data on a few things like various temperatures, oxygen sensors, and those kinds of things.  I haven't used the CD since it's easier for me to look up the codes in a manual or online.  The instructions are basic, but once you've looked at them the first time, things are pretty self-explanatory for any subsequent use.
B00N1OAZ20|4|worked although not a precision fit
B000TRBOK4|5|Perfect size!!
B004C6Q46M|5|Great so far. I've used the hitch for a bike rack. I haven't hauled with it yet.
B000637TF0|5|Really good product for leather.  I use it on my leather upholstery ~ 3-6 months.
B000COVZ08|5|good rear shocks
B000CP8MGC|3|the description states it has brass fittings, it does NOT.
B00H5JOAXM|5|The footrests work great unfortunately the pins that are supplied are smaller then what was on the bike so I reuse the old pins. Otherwise a good product
B00275DP44|5|All the rest I tried were plastic and the U was a sticker. This one is solid metal. The U is painted on and it's there to stay.
B002WB0M8K|5|installed. works. my car brakes.
B002ZBWKAU|1|The on/off button is intermittent at best. It does not set the psi off of the dial. It is consistently 5-7psi less.
B00LXKYA0C|1|Second one, and this one broke in just a week . The last one lasted a month.
B0039001TI|2|this is ONLY good for motors below 75 hp . for what I needed using a 115 hp motor you then need the 90w high performance oil.
B0092KVYGI|5|Best used for (diagnosis of pending battery failure.. Via voltage drop).. Google it..great diagnostic tool
B0041DZYJO|5|Came quick and worked well
B00EVLIHKE|5|Easy to install and look great!
B004BTHSZ6|5|Great!
B000CPCOBQ|5|Work awesome! Fit my Harley electra glide 04. So much better than a vaccuum bleeder.
B000C9MYEO|5|Great price and fir perfectly.
B00F9ISBTK|5|I bought two....saves &#34;digging &#34; for end to secure belt.
B00063X7KG|4|Old product sale but still works. By that I mean the product contains a spray that was sold nearly 7 years ago, it has updated since . Purpose of product still does the job though
B003G9G7PY|5|Just what I needed
B000C59M3O|5|Best shocks for any 91-96 B or D body.  Rides almost as nice as the more expensive bilstein sport shocks.
B00061SGJ0|5|Great tool, about twice as heavy and strong as I expected. Works great.
B00GSAUHB8|5|This shad fits a 2009 Subaru Forester Perfectly! It snaps in on the top, bottom and both sides of windshield, love this product.
B00BFDG118|1|These are only rubber inserts, not wiper blades as described in the headline. Very misleading and inappropriate. Universally, and in any auto parts store, a &#34;blade&#34; is the entire assembly. If you buy only the rubber, its called an &#34;insert&#34;. You can buy better quality inserts for less than half this price at any auto parts store: even at Wal Mart.
B00EOTE8BA|4|Better then the one that was replaced.
B000ZIC18Q|5|This little speaker was perfect worth all 12 dollars. Way better than internal speaker was very surprised was expecting to be dissapointed . Great speaker can't beat the price!!! Note I used this for cb.
B0002SA5YG|4|I really liked this one, to bad I got the wrong one. Had to return it.
B007PP26RI|5|does what it says.
B003S2A6T2|1|If you have an older Harley, this will leave you stranded.. Buy the real stuff for your rigid mount
B000HTNPLU|3|It appears to have done the job. Very stubborn putrid smelling oily substance however. If you get it on the evaporator fins, ensure you clean and flush them with simple green or something. Otherwise you'll be smelling it for weeks, believe me.
B005SA9C1A|5|great quality...!!!
B001INL9JE|5|Nice decal ....
B00I45P8CI|5|fantastic jacket, very well designed...love it.
B002PUTC0M|5|Awesome.  Same thing they same thing  they  sell on tool trucks for half the price.
B00I548U0K|4|Looks really good wish it was just a bit bigger
B00IGHGO3Q|5|Works perfect for what I wanted I bought the 52&#34; and the 32&#34; they are really bright and a easy install
B00CRR5L8U|4|good price,had no issues with pump.
B00KCYLLNO|5|Great quality, durable and looks great on the truck.  Ships fast and great company to deal with. Would definitely buy more from them!
B00M62PXG6|3|I give it at three cuz the material is very thin the perk the Pro is that is very easy just pulled up if you need to use the backseat
B00G9WA1ZC|5|Awesome product! First use was 4200 miles in every kind of weather. Held up like a champ. Secure on bike, rain cover fits well. A lot more room than I would have thought! Highly recommend
B005IGTNNQ|4|Received as promised.
B00390BS7C|2|The tools should have been a metric one with more grip precision. It worked but I had to be very careful to not strip the sensor or break the tool.<br />We need a metric equivalent!
B00EO4NW30|5|Worth waiting for alot of compliments
B00KSXWEAS|5|is very cool
B00VX7CK4S|5|This is a waterproof trash can for your car, supposedly. But with a little imagination, I found it to be much more!  First off, when I got it, I thought it was too nice for trash. I put it in my backseat and I realized I don't have that much trash on the road. So I had the idea of putting my kid's stuff in it.  Put it next to his seat and all his action figures fit nicely inside, and even gave him a place for his water bottle.  But then, I realized, he's only in the car a short time in the day,whereas I'm in the car all the time. So I dumped his stuff out and moved it to the front seat. I put my outgoing mail and packages in it. As you can see from the photos, that worked perfectly. Even giving the inevitable Netflix envelope an easy view so I don't forget to mail it. And it has handles to carry it with. As well as a flap to cover it all.  This was great.  But it could go further. I found that ordinary file folders fit perfectly inside, along with my laptop (in it's case).  The pockets give me a place for mail, water bottles,etc.  I suppose if I used it for business I could black out the logo &#34;Trash-Zilla&#34; with a sharpie, but I don't mind it.  As you can see, I really like it.  It's like the items sold very expensively by that company &#34;Thirty-One&#34; at home parties.  This could hold knitting materials on a trip, books to return to the library...it's almost like a diaper bag for adults to carry all their oddball stuff. And the waterproofing works in a reverse way: nothing in the car can spill on the insides.  For now, I have all my work stuff for Monday in it and ready to go. On Fridays I will bring it in the house to restock.  Very inventive and nice as well as made sturdy and strong.  Big like!  I rec'd a sample at no charge from the manufacturer to sample and review and give input on.
B0024E62CU|3|Not the greatest quality in it's construction but works as advertised. Would have given it 5 stars if it had better quality but for the price, it is cheaper then buying an OEM replacement part.
B0049IWMRI|5|Works well
B0021Z1JWU|5|This stuff is awesome! Does a great job with very little water spots left behind. Would recommend it costs a little more but is definitely worth it!
B00B1VUWAA|5|I love it !!!!
B0117X6OVW|5|Im very happy w/ this purchase😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
B00AC6YAKS|5|Super nice bag. I love the huge map pocket on the outside. It is very wide. It does not fit on my DR650 with an Acerbis tank, but it fits beautifully on my NC700x. Any wide flat tank should be great. Comes with a rain fly and seems like a quality bag.
B0002JM8G8|4|my husband uses this product and said it does a good job
B008G2XMD6|5|Arrived sooner than expected! Great quality, easy to install
B004SSEF56|4|Shipping was fast a little different than what I expected but good after all
B000C5YCLG|5|This sensor was a perfect fit for my vehicle. I have had it in for a week now and no issues to report. One thing I really appreciate was the fact that they included a small pack of anti-seize  for the threads rather than pre-applying it and putting a cap over the pre-treated threads like some other brands do. My experience has been, that when sensor threads are pre-treated, the caps often fall off in shipping and you receive a sensor that is covered in graphite. Other than that, it is difficult to tell how much higher or lower quality it is compared to other products until it has some miles on it .
B0008FUH46|4|Happy with our towpower locks.
B0055OG5O6|4|Fit well, good price, fast shipping cant complain
B00JEUHVPO|5|Awesome! Period.
B00LH05Q88|5|WORKS AND THE RIGHT PRICE
B000CFHDNU|2|Order went fine.  Unit fit as stated, however it only worked for about 2 months.  Definitely recommend purchasing a n<br />&#34;New&#34; part for a few bucks more.
B001C6IVYI|5|Mount was a little snug and I had to tap it in with a hammer.  Other than that - which isn't any more than what is necessary with other parts, it fit just fine.  Easy to install.
B003F06Y6G|2|Don't care for this fragrance at all.
B00B0C1RWM|5|Brakes were toast on my 2013 Odyssey at less than 20,000 miles. I certainly didn't want to use the factory pad/rotor combination again so after a lot of research, I picked this kit. Most complete brake kit I've ever seen, everything you need is already in the box. Install was a breeze. Only tricky part was removing the screw that holds the rotor in place, this screw WILL strip easily, use an impact driver like this: [[ASIN:B000NPUJYE TEKTON 2910 1/2-Inch Drive Manual Hand Impact Driver Set, 7-Piece]]   No more shudder, no more shake. Also looks really cool when chicks are checking you out in your minivan. proper torque is never a bad idea, you can find odyssey specs here:http://www.odyclub.com/forums/54-2011-odyssey/175474-2011-front-rear-brake-caliper-torque-specs.html Towed a trailer camping and had no issues coming down the mountain! I'll report back when I get some serious mileage on these
B00CA96TCM|5|Put these on a 2010 Rancher and the added width makes for a more stable ride.
B0002KKISM|4|its  a wonderful Product,
B002ONTBMO|1|Peeled off after 3 months from just washing my car..
B00A66GYDA|5|Ok
B00DTBVMBI|5|Fast shipping. Product as described in description. Happy with transaction and product.
B001C6OYYO|5|Working just fine on my street rod for door openers
B00LV9V78S|2|Headlights suck not brights as they say tail lights look great
B003BZQTVU|5|Nice quality, would recommend to others.
B000TYLZE2|5|Seem to work well no squeak. Good stopping.
B00NWGZ3A6|4|Nicely packaged in a snap shut plastic case with view window for use with case shut. Autoscales nicely on ohmmeter function. Legible large characters on the display. A good product at a good price.  Room is set aside in the plastic case for neatly storing test probes.  Clearly a well thought through design.  Bought on impulse, no refrets.
B00JS5XL1S|4|I can't tell the difference on ride smoothness, but my friend can on his bike.  The tire position directions are for scrawny tires. For manly tires, valve can be at or near bottom to facilitate pouring into tire and draining into tire, without overflowing.
B009FIC9U2|5|Great bolts.
B00CPKV8JU|5|I will say this seat is quite amazing. My wife was having significant problems riding on the back of my 1997 Harley Dyna Wide Glide. She could not last for more than an hour or so without having pain. We purchased this seat version where is just sits on top of my stock seat. It can be removed and replaced in less than a minute. After using this seat, my wife can ride for hours with minimal issues. A dramatic improvement. My wife has Rheumatoid Arthritis, which in itself causes her pain. The Buddy seat has made a big difference in our ability to take longer rides.  Great product, well worth the cost.  The only small negative  is the little pink heart and stitching.... a bit to girly for me... but hey, I can't see it when she is sitting on it.... so no big deal!  Thanks Butt Buddy!
B002M74KMS|5|Excellent performance and very nice sound. This is even fit my Honda Freed 2012 from Hong Kong
B008VGQKG8|5|Best window/glass cleaner.
B010H0QV00|3|...not so sure about the other included tools.<br /><br />As a tire gauge, this works satisfactorily (even if not elegantly) . Indicated tire pressures were nearly identical when I tested the same tires using an analog gauge. Because this is digital, it needs a battery, and this ships with five pre-installed 1.5v photo type button cells.<br /><br />These power the display and the modest LED (red and light). The LEDs won't blind a deer or help you find missing contact lenses in the dark...but they will help illuminate large objects or find your way to the real light switch.<br /><br />The window breaking tip releases from a stowed position by a sliding switch. I didn't test it on any actual auto glass, but it appears substantial enough to do what it claims in an emergency.<br /><br />As for the tools that fold out of the handle: collectively, they might be better than having NO tool...but I'm not sure their quality is such that they can be counted on for more than one use or very light duty service.<br /><br />Bottom line: it can't hurt to have one of these around for as long as you're willing to keep the batteries fresh.<br /><br />Note: this item provided for review purposes.
B00W67TC8Q|1|NOT HARLEY DAVIDSON,  it says &#34;horley&#34; do not buy this
B000C5I6H2|3|Didn't need them, it was listed with the frequently bought together list and I was in a hurry, I just clicked it and thought it was something else, so I have no idea whether they work good or not. But I have them if I ever need them I guess.
B002G3BATE|5|They are as described. They are steel shims that Wilwood sells to you so you can fine tune the spacing on your racing Wilwood brake calipers. Very good quality product!
B00OFQ3QTC|5|good quality and detailed, comes with wiring instructions and works perfect. I'll definitely be buying more switches like this when adding more lights
B00FOG9THU|5|I first bought the Alpinestars carbon version that was on sale for 135 or so, I think because it's discontinued.  The Alpinestars was really nice quality - actually better build quality than this.  But I bought a medium based on reviews, and it was too small.  The Alpinestars had no way to adjust it.<br /><br />This Leatt has two adjustment points that I've found.  The quality is descent.  My take is that the design is top notch.  The ergonomics and the research that went into it are top notch.  The quality of the materials is not bad but not great.  The way you move the adjusters is cheap but works well.  I think they've cut corners to get the cost down and make money - the but the corners they cut don't effect safety.  And I'm good with that, because they lead the field in this technology and that r&d costs money.<br /><br />A few adjustments and this one fit really well on my shoulders and looks great.  I'm very happy with it.<br /><br />Also, I bought the airsoft chest protector from Leatt and this fits into it so well.  Combining the two makes each better because the fit is tight and you can hold down the neck brace with little elastics on the shoulders of the airsoft.
B00COYNWP0|3|These didn't fit right on my car seats but I forced it, it ripped, I broke out the needle and thread and sewed the tears while it was in place and now its perfect.
B00ERFGYGI|5|ommmmmmggggg this decal isss amzaing! please buy this guys. it came in perfectly nice went on my car smooth and through snow, ice, hail, dirt, mudd, rocks, it hasnt torn peeled off- nothing ! its not too big not too small perfect decal for every nightmare befor christmas fan
B001GFW5Q0|4|Compared it to another similar product here on Amazon (you can find it by reading/searching my reviews) and this one is a better deal. Bigger and better at insulating. I only give it 4 stars because all these insulating products are all over priced in my opinion.
B003YMBO2E|4|Accents the jeep really well and covers up any dings on the cowl.
B00BOFETFC|5|Five star!
B00PFUWJMC|5|great service and products.
B001AD6T24|1|Not happy with the at all because it sags.  It needs complete support underneath or it will really sag and look bad.  I had to put a piece<br />of plastic underneath the bag to keep it from sagging so bad.
B000COB0J4|5|great product
B004MGDL3Q|3|There is a huge problem here.<br /><br />I ordered this product for my Cadillac Escalade after doing tons of research about the quality.<br /><br />The problem is that these are I'll described. They are NOT, I repeat not CAPA certified..<br /><br />I ordered a set and they came without the proper certification, so I contacted CAPA, who confirmed they are not certified by them. What a bummer.<br />So I had them replaced and was assured that I would receive the proper product. Nope! It was like a dog chasing it's tail in a circle. I continued the return process for 3 additional shipments until I finally had enough and realized I wasn't going to get what I payed for. Instead, I fought the description and the price was adjusted accordingly, not by much but it was something.<br /><br />The product does fit well and works well also. I guess they are just as good as CAPA certified, MAYBE, but I hate to purchase cheap products for an expensive car!
B000I1KJT8|5|I didn't know I needed these until I had them!
B008DL2D1W|5|absolutely beautiful on my truck
B00WLRQ67Q|5|Seems like a well built product .. Couldn't complete install due to hardware package not included .. Reached out and a package is in the way ... My 2 day shipping was a waste of MONEY AT THIS POINT ...
B00S75FNIO|4|Love it looks really nice
B010H0QV7S|5|The DBPOWER 5-in-1 Digital Tire Pressure Gauge/Multi Tool contains a tire gauge (LED digital display that displays the measurement), a bright beam flashlight, a seat belt cutter, a car glass breaking tool, and a red light for safety. The gauge has good backlighting, and displays in several different pressure units. It was accurate as compared (usually right on or -1 PSI) to the other gauges at the house. It only takes 2 AAA batteries (not included). It's a great tool to have in the car for safety.  Ergonomically, it's comfortable and has a rubber handle. I received this as a sample to review and I like it so much, I'm planning to purchase more for stocking stuffers this Christmas.
B002PH0E1Q|5|Works great
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Purchased for 2013 MB C250 Coupe  **Update Carla from XShade reached out to me to discuss my review so for that, they get 5 stars. Excellent customer service!  For the record, I use this sun shade daily and although it doesn't meet my expectations, it's better than not using anything at all (and my husband tells me that my expectations are too high because we live in Texas)  Original Review:  I purchased this in hopes of it blocking more heat than a shade I purchased at Costco. Unfortunately I am not impressed. I live in North Texas and do not have the pleasure of covered parking while at work during the day. When I leave in the evening (usually no earlier than 6pm), the steering wheel is hot to the touch and the amount of heat buildup literally takes my breath away. As other reviews have mentioned, the shade ends and center (where the discs do not cover) are very floppy and it takes some creative positioning to get it just right. I have tinted windows- 30% front, 3% rear/back- and the telescopic sunroof is also tinted.  Pros- Easy to flipfold and store (once you get the hang of it) Super small when stored. Can easily fit in glove box, door cubby (?), etc  Cons- Doesn't keep my car cool... steering wheel still scorching hot Discs do not cover entire area of windshield, leaving 'floppy' edges
B0079QRRRM|2|It is not satisfied with the workmanship of a backpack.<br />When using a very short (14 days) on a thread seams blossomed and damage. From which it follows that the quality of materials is very low. This spoils the appearance of the backpack. Threads just blossomed along the seam - which closes with a zipper bag. You can see it in the photo. Very disappointed ..
B00AVVZWJW|5|Nice complete kit replaces all the seals and gaskets you need to install your new turbo. Good price to.
B00KTIYXLU|5|programming was easy may to replace battery when receive but remotes works great!!!
B00WLVN6NY|4|The bulbs arrived very quickly. I echo previous comments: not as bright as I was hoping, hardly noticeable during the day. Overall work fine... hope they last longer than last aftermarket set that burned out after 10 mos.
B0041CBU3Y|5|Fit my Aprilia Mana 850 well.
B001L1MGFY|5|I lo luv ED product I have purchased these before thru someone else but these where what u wanted shipped very fast and damage free.
B004QHNBOU|5|As described....
B00RXFPAAK|5|Surprisingly easy to install and worked perfectly. I got a quote from a mechanic for $330 - 340 to replace the part. Bought it on Amazon for around $40 and installed it myself in about 10 minutes.
B006NIB6U6|5|Highly recommended for Land Rover vehicles from 1987-1998. Works GREAT in all classic land rover Automatic gearboxes, I use it in my rebuilt 4HP22. Mix this with Valvoline Maxlife and you have GREAT fluid.
B00CIVSA2E|5|Items fit my husband's Can-Am as promised.  Timely delivery.  Husband likes convenience of zipping and taking the bag into motel room.  Medium sturdy nylon will hold up with regular care.
B000MD4YKM|5|Nice unit!
B00H7R4RXA|5|Good
B00MUEHKWU|1|Cheap
B005UVN1PU|5|The case fit well.  I just had to try and reprogram the remote once I changed the case but didn't get the chance to because somebody totalled the car while it was parked.  Oh well....I would buy again.
B00M4JSYUI|5|Thanks its gooooood
B000VKTUD2|5|Does the job and a great price to boot! This fits perfectly in to my 2006 Prius. I notice the difference in air quality when I change these out annually.
B001EWG4VC|3|Ordered these for my car.  They are cheap.  They don't always stay in place, but I purchased more for the looks.
B00QI6S68S|5|Nice heavy duty connectors.  Only negative is that no instructions were included.
B0049DXBAU|5|Lightweight plastic covers that hook over the headrest and cover the seatback and bottom.  Covers are great for short-term use.
B00523AMBC|4|Chlorine reduction is poor, but all other filtration features of the filter that comes with it are good. BUT, if you go and buy a solid carbon block .5micron filter and put it in here, its AMAZING.<br /><br />It does leak a little from the AWFUL plastic fittings, I replaced mine with brass from the hardware store and works great now.<br /><br />Bottom line, buy this and buy a Watts .5 micron filter to put in it.
B00PQZPMYI|5|fit perfect.
B005R84EPM|5|Great for the price!
B004Y0BC9A|2|Loved the hat..but velcro strip in back did not stick at all!!! Can't wear hat!
B00QRE0OOA|3|Nice unit that talks to your iPad via WiFi... a little tedious but does work. Has some features that I would never use. I am not racing my stick shift car.
B006G1ERPQ|5|Exactly what I needed
B00LWH6QXA|5|Vry gooooooood
B00QJOZNO4|1|The bolt to small
B000BOCAMQ|1|No good. Don't waster your money. Buy a lens replacment on line and be done with it. Shop around for best price!
B000BQM6H8|5|Best ever!! I've used kit for over 25 years. Awesome wax
B009DJZTGE|5|Excellent
B00PIJT2SE|5|This part fit my 89 Honda PC800 (Pacific Coast - 24K miles) motorcycle perfectly. A straight swap out of the original. What had been very erratic voltage readings has tamed down to normal now.<br />I purchased this because my bike quit on me while touring. A brand new battery was not getting a proper charge from the system. The bike ran until the battery was discharged then stopped dead. Now power, no lights, no cranking. Nothing. Had to be hauled.<br /><br /> With only the stator and the rectifier to suspect,this part was the cheapest to try.<br /><br />Seems like a good call.<br /><br />Only time and use will tell if this is a reliable part long term.
B00I28C8W0|4|It's ok. It's been couple weeks since I bought and still gives the strong coffee smell. Will purchase again.
B001DBZU2S|5|All good.
B000JZYSU4|5|part fit great replaced old rusted front exhaust on 1997 dodge Dakota it does not come with the 4 bolts you will have to buy those separate
B0049MEE0C|5|Two cans charged my 1998 Ford Escort (4cycl) so now it blow cool, not supper cold air. I'm happy!!
B000H90XEW|5|Works as expected, I use them on all my bikes
B001N87K7O|5|excellent to use as noise insulation  of  tire  noise,over the  non visible part of the  plastic  wheel  insulator,,,,light weight water proof
B00I8J07QC|5|Worked great however the small brass washers were not included, just used the old ones with no issues, Thanks James
B004BTT2SM|5|They are very good pads. Quiet and braking is very good. Easy to install and price is right.
B00280BSSI|5|Good quality and fit.

B001810SHA|5|Works Great
B006TMLZHA|5|Perfect match and easy to purchase.
B0042HU3GS|3|Chem Guys “Butter Wax” and a coating of  Chem Guys “Synthetic Quick Detailer” in my opinion does a better job of highlighting and protecting  a cars paint job.  It’s a good product, but……..
B00BJJZ2QS|5|F150 XLT 2009.  The quality of the mirror is better than the stock Ford side mirror. I had to replace the OEM mirror twice in 6 years. Stock mirrors didn't have puddle lights but they are wired from the factory to accept a puddle light.  Everything works plug and play. I too  as other folks mentioned<br />watched panel removal on you tube. Replaced both sides in about an hour.  Thanks too all the great people for sharing on You Tube.  You will Like the mirrors.
B005QWLENE|4|Painted the inside of pipes black to look a little more real. Look great on my golfcart
B00TOFID06|5|good quality and fast service very good
B000HBGHFY|5|MacBook Pro hinge screws are now tight!
B00MDZQ0B8|5|I bought a pair of these blades from Costco and have had them on my truck for almost three years and I am amazed at how well they have held up! Although Southern California has been in a drought the entire time, the rubber has held up to the sun well, because when it does rain, the blades do a great job of keeping my windshield clear. I bought another pair at Costco a year and a half ago, but have not used them, because the first pair are still going strong. Highly recommended!
B00V5YOBFA|5|Perfect
B00QFY2BCK|2|This wipe only kept my headlight shiny for one day. They are back to the cloudy yellow tint they were before.
B00IVTGL2S|5|Shipped fast, packaged good, works like new, would recommend to others.
B00D2HTIIS|5|Very nice
B00PR4EAPU|5|Perfect fit and just what I needed.
B00GUVG6TC|5|Love this!!!
B00BCRMA9Y|1|These seat covers are horrible. Let me just start off with the warning on the instructions paper...<br />The warning says that these products may contain lead, and other toxic pthalates that lead to cancer, and possible birth defects.<br /><br />Are you serious? Why are these even allowed to be on the market!!!<br /><br />Not to mention they're complicated. I was fussing around with the covers,  realising I had to unscrew some things in the car and remove some things just to get one on. Needless to say,  after I saw the warning, I packed them up as fast as possible and now I'm either about to throw them away or try to get a refund by sending them back...do not get these. It shouldn't even be legal to have this on the market.
B000AS3D3S|5|Got these for my 2010 mustang and these are a perfect fit. The adbv is exactly where it should be and is made from silicone so they stay nice and pliable for a long time. I've been using these with Pennzoil platinum/ultra since new with no leaks and under the valve cover it's nice and clean no varnish at all.<br /><br />Big thumbs up to Ford/Motorcraft
B002P8L8XI|1|Looks like what you pay for it.  Cheap and the black didn't match my car
B00J3YDWTA|5|Just the right size.  Does the job well without making the entry look cluttered.  Sticks just fine and can be repositioned.  No sticky mess on window.
B001DRHMMS|5|Excellent product, very affordable!
B001FIDNGO|5|If you have a hard time finding the seat belt buckle, these a what you need. Kind of a pain sticking through the seat belt webbing, but that's to be expected. Once through and snapped into the retainer ring, it stays put! Very pleased with this product.
B00D46P06G|4|Works as advertised, and easy to install.
B00SLKQGF4|5|Put them on a 2011 ram 1500. Look great fit great. Easy to install. Fast delivery.
B00JRE67ZM|5|This thing exceded my expectations. Plenty of room. Various storage for small items. Secures to luggage rack with ease. The rain cover was a nice touch also.
B0033Z3I76|5|It work great and it came when I expected it too
B00KO5VI98|5|Perfect fit
B000JWON6Q|5|THIS WORKS GREAT, TRIED TO USE A 50.00 SHOCK, CAR ALMOST ROCKED OUT OF CONTROL WHEN GOING OVER UNEVEN BUMPS. THIS ONE COSTS 250.00 BUT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY OF IT. THANKS FRED PFIESTER
B009AG1CH0|5|as described
B000N5SNQA|5|These springs  are great.  compared to the stock springs they are literally a million times better.  I was afraid that the ride would suffer, but in my opinion  the ride improved.  Used these on my 2006 Sportsman 500  and they were worked perfectly!  Now I am hoping to get some to install on my new 2015 Sportsman 570.
B0034HNMQK|5|fit perfectly great filter !!!
B00JC86Z0A|4|Not too much in the pen but absolutely covered the scratch...
B00390O036|5|Fit my '84 perfect. Takes a little more force than you'd expect but once they're in they won't pop out on their own.
B0028ZKMM6|1|Too short for the Yamaha Roadliner and I had to splice in wires.  Very dissatisfied!
B002YI72TS|5|I like it, not too shiny.  Applies easy.  Seems to last a month or more...still waiting after a month to see how long a reapplication is required.
B00TY7JES4|4|Exactly what I wanted
B003QS8DZ2|5|Very nice, good price, well worth it.
B003YQQS6M|5|worked like a gem
B00JHN1W7G|4|Fits a little tight in the air box but just work with the cover and it will go back together.  have seen 2+ MPG increase in town.  5+ on highway.
B004NFXA7I|5|Works great.
B00R3O0Y0M|5|GREAT UPGRADE FOR HORNS ANY VEHICLE. ALSO LOOKS GOOD WHEN SEEING IT FROM OUTSIDE OF VEHICLE
B0092ZWDNG|5|Fits Great!!
B008MMZDMI|5|Just as advertised. Looks good
B010UA5UHW|5|Arsenal is the way to go people! ! Great product for the price. Nice wiring harness and switch! !
B0013F8PZS|5|This shield is great. I have a 2014 Patriot and I love the look of the shield on it and not to mention it keeps the bug numbers down. I live in the country and when I leave town at night the bugs to my headlights only because there are no street lights. Since installing this the knats and other little bugs get wisked away up and over my windshield. I was having to wash my windshield almost daily because of them, but since I installed this I might have 4-6 bugs hit my windshield while driving 20 miles at night. The giant dragonfly that live around here are about the only ones that make it to the windshield. Don't listen to the other review that said 1 star. This is an authentic Mopar part with a Jeep emblem on the driver side. Buy this you wont be disappointed.
B004AQZBZE|5|Worked great
B00Q3CI3QM|5|Great cover, have a 2001 Porsche Boxster and fits nicely.  I park it outside and great to use after a car wash/dry to keep the elements off of it.  Great security feature as well where you can lock the car cover to the car to prevent theft.  Highly recommend.
B00AF3OR7O|5|Just what I expected.
B000C93ESO|5|Fit great on 99 outback. Easy to install
B004C443PS|4|I like these gloves I was able to wear them all day to a convention dressed as Black Widow from The Winter Soldier. I had to cut and shave the extra material in the middle webbing on left glove, but it was comfortable after that.
B00XULVDHK|1|Thus thing doesn't work because it's blocking my sides and one of the sides keep falling off
B0092UX74U|5|Fit like a oem part very pleased
B00H1L5NM6|5|Love it.
B000UUMM6K|5|good quality,great price, easy installation
B007R4GKWY|3|Front is silk screen. The back is embroidered with the 2nd amendment. Be careful when cleaning or the front will peel away. Velcro strap for adjustment is good. The date of the 2nd Amendment ratification is wrong. Chinese making a hat about our Constitutions Bill of Rights??
B00YQ4FJM0|5|Bought this as more of an accessory more than necessity for my new Mercedes. Matches the wood and chrome on the interior and comes in handy although I'm not a huge coffee drinker.
B00LCBK6CS|5|Pops the glass open and fast service
B000HGBB3M|5|Everything was good it fit perfectly.
B000LOLWZW|5|Sturdy snap hook.  Worked well.
B011RZ12HQ|5|The product is cheap but functioning very good.
B005BP3U2Y|5|I haven't had to use this yet, but I am relieved to have it with me.  I am a retired RN, and I am sometimes the first person to stop at an accident.  It is reassuring to know that I may be able to get to an injured person even if the door can not be opened.  I also want to be able to rescue an animal or a child if they are left in a car on a hot day, and are in distress.
B000XXZZ7W|5|Love these grips and if the rubber gets worn out you can buy replacements around $15 and the grips are back to new
B000N2U5E6|5|Worked great.
B007TN15EG|5|A++++
B00C1YI2XA|2|Cheap flimsy product, several segments inoperative out of the box.
B0017LY0H0|4|Fit my 1990 Chevy lumina apv. Delivery was quick and it mounted up to the factory hanger.
B000TYOEK4|2|This is an easy install and fits perfectly, however, it worked for 13 months and developed a dead spot. The pedal has less than 15K miles on it and it failed already. You get what you pay for.
B0009IQXCM|5|Long time user of Meguiar's.  Very easy to put on and remove.  Would buy again.
B00O6QKLB2|5|great
B007Q8ESSO|5|Perfect fit for our 2014 Honda CRV.
B0084DVD06|5|High quality and perfect fit. Easily installed on a hot day after its hard time to warm in the sun and allowed to stretch a little. Works great and have had not issues with it. Does not scratch the paint like the cheaper ones.
B000BW8LS0|5|Perfect and way better than a standard set I put on last year. A much easier install and shouldn't have to worry about getting home with these.
B0049MKQD6|5|Very satisfied with product and seller.
B000KFUFBO|5|just got today aug 14th friday 2015 and they fit perfect for my 2000 jetta TDI MK IV.  So am very happy with them. They look great
B0027QWNI2|5|This product was a little bit big for my car but it does what it needs to do which is store some paper, cards and small items. Now I have some extra storage space.
B00JA1VURC|5|I read reviews on this on forums and they were very mixed but I decided to give it a try anyways. I put it on my 2013 v-rod muscle with k&n filter and v&h competition slip-ons. It runs great! I could really tell a difference with the fuelpak and filter. There are no dead spots throughout throttle acceleration at all. I do think from what I have read that climate and elevation are a factor with the standard tunes they send you, but they will work with you to tweak them to your specific needs. I was lucky because it worked great with standard tune.
B00BKNPN8A|1|These were no good I had them for less than a day on my car and one of them was junk. I hard wired them with a kit straight from my battery then a capacitors but one of them would just go on and off. I switched ballast and they work great.
B009X3Q8QA|4|The boots are a little stiff otherwise the really nice.
B00CJ1VWK0|5|product was great,
B009XRL5NC|5|As an Offroader. This sticker is a good reminder to take things slow.
B00R1WW95O|5|so far so good.  I didn't notice any difference in reception.
B001GJ3FIS|5|Like much
B00ZQ2XV9E|5|So far so good with this brake rotors and pads, great quality and a lot stopping power in my minivan......
B008YFTB4E|5|I wanted to give some time to test product out before I wrote a review. This product is amazing works really well,good price. Installed these on a 99 tahoe in the low beams. Don't even need to use high beams at night. I had a problem seeing at night with stock headlights well not no more.i will Def be purchasing again if need to for other vehicles.
B00E5OUOCQ|2|this shade does not fit my vehicle well - difficult to easily determine correct size!
B000H0KMEC|5|Thanks
B000H5Q5G6|4|worked as advertised
B006E4L4Q0|3|Came nicely packed and fast, had some troubles cutting and fitting, other than that it looks good.
B00M9D9638|5|if you got a end dump best thing for you

B00EINDJSU|5|Kroil nuf said
B001F0MHV4|5|Great winch strap for boat
B001QIUGVI|5|Very nice to have a scanner with all these capabilities at this price. It's easy to use and does a lot. The Live Data and the SRS and ABS tools are great. This thing never really confuses me. It's nice to know I'll always have my own nice scanner!
B006TMTIRO|5|Product fit not perfect, but I made it work, quickly shipped, well packed...AAA+++
B00QT21WSW|5|As described, good service. Thanks
B006TMTHKC|5|Product fit not perfect, but I made it work, quickly shipped, well packed...AAA+++
B00RY4NQJM|5|First off, timely shipping. Second, the included instructions were very clear-simple but detailed. Third, the kit included both a razor and rubbing alcohol/cotton balls, so the entire process is covered from instructions to tools and th actual decals themselves. I just finished putting them on and am extremely happy with the result. Also. I saw another comment on here, a vague but negative comment. Did you not see on the papers they sent you to contact them before leaving a negative review so that they could possibly resolve your issue? Sheesh.
B00GOFSBAQ|1|Disappointed, it was too small
B00ODFODN8|5|These are the best HD cargo nets on the market.<br /><br />Most other cargo nets quickly tie themselves into knots and balls of knots.<br /><br />I modified mine to use safety clips.  Clip in, pull, done.
B00IV1K5FK|1|Installed these in a F150 with the PIAA light bar. The lights are great, but like the other poster mentioned, the bases snapped after about 6 hours having them on. So far, nada on customer service from PIAA.
B00R3IQAP6|5|I got a compressor that was headed for the scrap pile. I disassembled it and noticed the piston ring was damaged and the block was scored. This easy-to-install kit restored the compressor nicely. It now supplies the air horn on my pick up.
B00JXYEYE2|5|Nice kit!  Fit perfectly. Great that the oil was included.  Full set of O-rings includes every O-ring necessary.
B001GJ7CUK|5|easy  instalation and stronger than i espected
B001RMT90W|5|nice new item, clean, shipped quickly
B00OXZEMGQ|5|Fits just like the original and comes with both clips.

B00CQ7W0Q2|5|Outstanding product. Really enjoy the comfort they provide. We're very easy to install and look great on my all black Goldwing.
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Wish I knew about this years ago.  Makes owning outdoor furniture a pleasure
B00435RU5Q|5|happy with this purchase
B000CGHZ5K|5|Original Equipment and works, comeso with everything needed for installation.
B0002LWEY2|5|I really love this sunshade.  So far it stands up Straight and stays in place.  My old one was a bit short and doubled over instead of remaining rigid.  It makes a big difference in the heat in the car.  Only slight negative is that I feel bad bending it a little around the rear view mirror.
B003BZ7MHA|5|AWESOME! My 2015 chrysler 200 3.6L sounds like an M3!  Picked up horsepower and now everyone looks!  Make sure you have the muffler installed by proffesionals.  New pipes added were bent to perfection. Thank you Canyon Muffer!
B00DX8D2XI|5|Well-crafted product and speedy delivery.
B00HJDAMMW|3|It was smaller than it looked online.
B001OZL9XC|5|ONE OF THE BEST OILS OUT THERE I USED IT FOR MY 2012 R1 AND IM HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS!!!
B0054SF5UI|5|Good
B00B2A2FS2|1|Very misleading.  9007 bulbs have piggyback halogen bulbs,  not even headlights just like turn signal or dome light bulbs.  They suck and I never leave dims because it just gets dimmer on brights.<br />I'm looking for a good set now
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Fits perfectly in my small crossover SUV (BMW X1). I had no problems using this at all. Face the silver part outwards to reflect the sun. It seems to just fit itself into the windshield automatically. My car is significantly cooler in the hot Texas summer. I am going to buy one for my fiance as well. :)
B000BO8Z9I|5|I used this polish to polish a stainless steel muffler that I did not even think had chrome underneath the dirt and thick grim. After polishing the muffler tip 2-3 times with steel wool, the chrome underneath started to shine again.
B00BFDJ72S|5|Good oem fit, on my 1999 rhd Ek3 civic.<br />Honda Power
B006DDHZ1K|5|work great!
B00BSGJQ4Q|5|These led bulbs work just great!  Cannot beat the price.  I installed all of the light bults in y RV with  Saved lots of money on these than paying for them thru Camping World.
B00ATXEPQI|5|Very good, recommended! Use it all the way to make the trip.
B00KXHGJV4|5|It what it is  good
B0049MEE0C|5|I bought 2 FJC  for the price of one (absolutely a very nice price) , and I used both on my Nissan quest, now I really feel the cold inside my car, not more sultriness for the kids........ TioMartin
B008RDL78G|5|Excellent product at a great price. .. about half what the dealer was asking
B00IM9AL7I|4|Good for the short haul. Heavy duty helmet that is comfy. Rattles at 65 MPH with the cool face shield but such is life with a half helmet.
B00MW8G2IW|1|useless POS!!  I was unable to program the remote.  I tried to get support, but it didn't help.  Now I'm unable to return it!!
B000CLI8JC|5|excellent, very good
B003LTEC0G|5|So far so good.
B00N4DDF0C|5|Love the lights.
B001810SHA|3|It may or may not have worked. I couldn't get the pressure gauge to work properly. Put one can into my car and quit out of fear of causing damage.
B0009LSXAE|5|The bondo 800 black restore made the black cladding on my 2003 Avalanche look new.
B0055DNV1W|5|High quality handlebars for an extremely good price. When I ordered them I worried that the quality would suffer because they were such a low price but this was not the case. I ended up going with mini ape hangers over these but that was just personal preference.
B00CIVU0K4|5|Product fits as promised in my husband's Can-Am.  Don't waste your money on the Can-Am product unless you just have money to burn.  This product holds up well, had good construction, and is very convenient to take by the handles into a motel room on a trip.  Keeps items from rolling around in the luggage compartment, and finding things you need is a breeze.  Worth the money.
B004LF6KJU|5|it is exactly what I needed and the price was perfect and the delivery was on time
B0007VDRXE|5|Easy to install
B004RFKBEO|5|Good rack for bikes or luggage. Rather heavy but manageable. Holds 4 bikes with no problem.

B0016IHC3I|5|perfect fit, 1984 corvette good service from supplier, very friendly
B004VWL8WM|5|Great Quality
B00O92T1NC|5|Love this product!  My 2 little girls produce quite a bit of trash from their emptying of their backpacks to their daily snacks in the car.  This bag helps keep my car clean and looks sleek in the process.  Easy to empty.  No smell.  Shape holds well
B00EVY2SKG|5|Highly absorbent, very cheap, holds up in the laundry.
B0031HT8JS|5|very easy to install and works great
B007Z8VG30|1|One of the letters did not stick well, fell right off. Surface was prepared with pure rubbing alcohol.
B004AJ4HWY|5|This is a great product. Great quality for the price. My mechanic had no issues installing. This was the best thing I could have done to my 2000 Ford Expedition Getting rid of the air suspension system and replace with this item.
B005DL3DHS|5|Bought my first diesel ... 2006 f350 lariat beautiful truck .. studs replaced .. egr delete. Banks high ram .. banks intake ... 4 inch ss exhaust ... biggest mistake I ever made was buying a Ford 6.0.. every trip to the dealer and the parts guy wouldn't even ask which engine he already knew ... he always said 6.0? Hope you have deep pockets ... hated that guy ..  2 years between tires turbo oil cooler .. full pump.. and 3 alternators amongst other things  I'm I've 20k in just maintenance ...so when my injectors were fouling I took it to dealership ... the wanted 5k to replace 1 bank  .  If you don't know that's only 4 of the 8..  I was panicking ... I called the finance company to see if I can refinance shortly after ... they told me my truck I both 2 years ago for 27k was now worth 8k... due to the engine and lack of demand .. I was flabbergasted. .I said how could you give me a 30k loan 2 years ago and my truck is only worth 8k now .... bottom line step one don't by a 6.0 unless you have deep pockets or you're a diesel mechanic ... back to my Rev x experience ... thought I was in it for 5k ... decided to change all my filters fuel and oil with new synthetic like usual and try 2 bottles of Rev x... 1000 miles nothing no difference ... 2000 miles still nothing at 2500... I'm sitting in a parking lot on my laptop... truck stops shaking ..  I thought to myself did it die ? Nope the sticking injector freed up... Today my truck runs better than the day I bought it ... and it cost me 65$ not 5k to fix ... I will add this at every oil change ... thank you revx... now I can feed my family ...

B00LG07MZE|5|Worked out great.  Used them on our GMC truck side windos.
B00BP4QF3G|5|good value
B0041CDPQO|5|If your motorcycle or scooter doesn't come with a 12V outlet, this makes a handy substitute. Mine already came with a Battery Tender cable attached to the cycle battery, but you can easily install one yourself. I use mine plugged into the Battery Tender cable when underway to run a GPS or recharge my cell phone.
B00GM2D3IG|2|I attempted install of the front lights. I have not attempted the rear ones yet simply because I do not want to further damage my vehicle. The visor lights were easy to install, however while attempting to install the dome lights, none of the bulbs would even fit into the respective slot. While attempting to install the dome light, I seemingly broke part of the connection in the car trying to force the bulb in, resulting in no lighting from the dome light even after I reinstalled the stock bulb. I would not recommend buying these to any e92 owner as they are a complete pain to install, and then, after all the hassle of getting them in, they may not even be functional / DOA. Get what you pay for I suppose.
B006STTIVY|5|works great......  perfect for watering plants and washing the car and hosing the drive and, and, and...  get one.
B00UX02QM2|5|Great!
B000L7JQMU|5|Did ok
B000ZNM8H0|5|Very easy to install.  Works great.
B00029J4JC|5|very good
B004HCOE72|5|Worked pretty well even though my lights were not that bad. I would personally try a cheaper one first next time before using this one. Overall good though.
B000IETT5K|5|thanks
B00N191SF8|2|Rusty when I got them. For the price that's unacceptable
B003TVR26W|5|Well, it's a blue LED indicator. Or at least that's what I'm using it for. It works great and I don't foresee any problems. Glad I got it.
B004GC753S|5|This item fit my 2004 Z71 Tahoe and the replacement bumper perfectly. After some drunk person hit my car and drove off (thanks buddy!), the cheapest quote I got was $800 to fix my car. With this, a new bumper, snazzy new headlights (both also ordered off amazon) and about an hour of time, I fixed it for under $300. The front end looks great now.
B00KPWBBLA|5|Just got done putting them on my new 2015 jeep  wrangler freedom edition.  Instalation was easy but do it with 2 people.  It only took 55 min for both sides total
B000F3NFOU|5|Words can not explain the amazingness of these springs. Maybe the best thing I've ever bought for my car. They dropped it by an inch and a half which is perfect. My car looks amazing. I bought them for my 2013 Corolla. My brother is a mechanic so he installed them for me but I helped and watched and it looked fairly easy. It took about an hour per spring. The difference in suspension is amazing. I turn corners like a drag car and he handles like a dream. I would 100% recommend these. They shipped fast and I received them via FedEx very fast. Thanks!
B001S30ISM|5|complete unit was a perfect fit
B004809YBE|5|as described and fast ship
B00NP82LUQ|5|Absolutely the BEST! If your tired of the factory screws and the headache they create look no further. This returns the simplicity of removing the soft top that it should be.
B001LHVOVK|5|Works very nicely
B00FHSNV92|5|Fit perfectly, and well worth the money. The visor and modular chin guard work well one handed. I've used it for about a month and the mechanism isn't showing any signs of getting loose or wear.
B000FW2NYO|3|A lot better than packing bearings by using your hands.
B00R6Z53RW|5|same
B00GSAUHB8|5|Just as advertised, Good deal!
B000VKZNZG|5|Fit just as the factory unit.  Does not have studs on the cat side like the factory unit, make sure you have some 3/8&#34; hardware handy.
B002H8P1G6|5|Nice, bigger than expected
B008IK7TSA|5|excellent
B00CC12NOG|5|Wife loves them in her 2014 Encore.
B002UC4Q7Y|5|We replaced the latch for our screen door on a 1992 Newmar. It was an exact match.<br />UPDATE: works beautifully since being installed.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Just what the Doctor ordered. Love them. They do the job perfect. And for a great price.
B008M7IIIY|5|Didn't expect much but when I received my order I discovered they were metal and not plastic. Im not sure why anyone would actually set the lock screw but I can imagine there are valve cover bandits out there stealing air out of tires.
B004LWV0GQ|5|Great addition for extending the range of NOCO Smart Charger
B000C9NPFQ|2|part will not fit for the 1997 geo tracker that I'm working on
B002PQQF2Y|4|Great price
B000L7JQMU|5|Works well. Does exactly what I wanted it for.
B000CQVP9C|3|Careful when ordering this item for a 2003 Civic.  The bleed screw as shown in the picture is accurate, and is quite a bit longer than the Honda original.  While it is workable, you won't be able to get a fully enclosed 8 mm bleed wrench (or even a flange wrench) over it, you'll have to use a standard 8 mm open end wrench.  Fine for when it is new, but could be a real problem way down the road when things corrode.  Also, the manufacturer apparently reversed the part number for my particular shipment (the '75 was actually the right side, and the '76 was the left side instead of the other way around).  Not a problem because I ordered both.<br /><br />Otherwise, fits and works.
B0002JMFM0|5|So much cheaper then AutoZone and I didn't have to eplain to a counterman that the hose I need isnt for a particular application.
B000VKYCNU|4|Very satisfied. Ordered on a Thursday night and at my front step Saturday morning.
B00FS2TL8C|5|I bought it a few weeks ago, I tried it and I think it has a good quality and a great price. I'd definitely recommend it.
B00DMEFH7W|4|I love them, they fit my VW Beetle perfectly and match the paint!  Only problem is that the pull cords to tighten the bench seat ripped out easily when pulled.  My suggestion is that you reinforce the cording.  But they are cute!
B00O3GNURM|5|I bought 2 for my F150 crewcab (1 for the front and 1 for the back).  It is absolutely perfect for the back but about 1 inch too big for in front.  The flexible sides allowed for me to use it in front.  While not an exact fit in it is still very usable..
B00MX33VJO|4|They worked good we had to paint them. They painted up nice. I had to trim the Bach just al little other than that all looks great!!!
B000X1E59S|3|good oil but over priced on Amazon
B00KGGTF9U|5|Great product and company to buy from. I would recommend buying from this company.
B001PQDLCM|1|They don't fit my 07 bmw m6
B0002JMUZM|5|Perfect......it was nice to have the plastic clips come with the product, which seem to always break.
B00WXBYYR4|5|Great price, shipped fast. It's refrigerant.
B0002Q80RW|5|As described, arrived on time.
B0023001O0|5|No fuss solution
B0006MWPZU|3|It doesn't stay in place.  Have to shift it every time I get in the car.  Just as I figured!!  Six year old Scion XB
B0009IQZH0|5|These are great! And the price was really good. My car shines like it was new!
B00KTHV10C|5|You can also switch the Honda logo from old key to this new one.
B0116TDGLI|1|I bought this for a ford expedition,because it was a little cheaper.They say you get what u pay for.....this item was a piece of crap,I put on passenger side it looks great,I put on driver side and it wasn't fitting correctly,as I looked closer it was cracked and warped,I contacted the company to no avail,DO NOT BUY THIS!
B000C9B2QK|5|Works like a TPS should and with a really good price. I would buy again!
B004GNJD0A|5|amazing product. I purchased this to protect the shifter cable on my ATV from the exhaust headers as I have already melted 2 in the past year. After 2 rides of about 3-4 hours each, the heat shield showed no signs of damage from the heat. Works as advertised and a very cost effective solution to a annoying problem.
B00HEPH26O|4|Worked well. Easy installation and cold results...
B012YMDPHG|5|Simple, easy to use. Definitely a tool everyone should have in there toolbox. Item arrived quick, just as pictured. Ready to use right out of the box.
B000EQR7XS|5|looks just like the original good fit!!
B007EA6R0Q|5|Does a very good job of handling two grand parents and three grand children bikes. It's a jigsaw puzzle but it gets the job done.  Very solid construction.  The narrow end tubes have good points and bad.  The idea is good but kids 16-20 inch bikes still tough to fit.  Rubber securing straps work great.
B004M3F5CO|1|Holy crap.....used to remove a decal and it etched the clear coat. I now have a permanent decal mark on my new 2015 Tundra. Normally use WD 40. Should have stayed with that. Thanks Turtle Wax.
B0018CWEQC|5|Perfect Fit, Easy Install
B000QGTGOE|1|Advertised as a direct replacement.  The core on this radiator is only 1 inch thick.  The OEM radiator was 1.25 inches thick.
B00KH84KFQ|1|I had the key cut to the T, but the key did not start the car.
B004N63S9W|4|good
B004MSJ7E6|5|Goods arrived fast and well packed ,just what I wanted as described accurately .<br />Look forward to future trading thank you
B0072LCX4G|2|bought for a 2006 VW Jetta.  The only buttons that will work on the steering wheel are mute, volume up, and volume down.  With a Kenwood DNX572BH and this adapter, the audio mode in the multi function display (MFD) disappears and you are thus unable to move tracks up and down or advance the tuner up or down without changing the current information screen in the MFD.  I bought this so I could retain the steering wheel controls, but without being able to advance or change tracks, I went ahead and just bought a remote for the head unit instead.
B00O2IQ230|5|Really good wiper blades,better than original equipment.<br />It took a few minutes to figure out just how to install them.<br />Once installed properly they work great.<br />Good price on these blades as well.
B00VV7K4B6|4|To install, attach everything to the distributor with the cap off and make sure all of the internal connections are solid.  I wasn't aware of that and it cost me a lot of time and a little money.<br /><br />Once you are absolutely certain that nothing is amiss, reinstall the distributor cap and then install the distributor onto the engine.  Screw in the round hole first.  The distributor only goes on one way, so be sure to have a gander into the engine to make sure you've got everything lined up.  This distributor is going to be much better machined than your old 16-or-so year old one, so you SHOULDN'T be able to cram it in wrong, but it never hurts to do it right the first time.
B00L2LX3VE|5|This is a high quality part at a very good price.this kit at the dealer would be 400 to 600 dollars.
B0048J6UEE|5|Much better than original equipment. Worth the extra money.
B001GN1KAE|5|Plug-N-Go!<br />No issues on my 2003 Chevrolet truck.
B00JAR6LXY|5|Nice product. Packaged really well, peanut foam and bubble wrap everywhere. I wouldn't imagine anyone receiving this item damaged unless UPS threw it over your fence. No worries though, it shipped via FedEx.  Far as the lights themselves, personally, I think they are great. The light bar is very bright, even in mid-day. I'd say the only draw back (if you're that &#34;annoying&#34; kind of picky) would be the LED ambers and LED brake lights visibility only because light bar pretty much swallows them up. People in my area don't use flashers anyways, so no worries on my end.
B005X7RLIO|5|Quick shipping, easy to attach. I used RTV for the attachment to supliment the adhesive provided.

B005GYDBNS|5|In the interest of full disclosure, my son works at Texas ExxonMobile site where Mobil 1 is manufactured, so I am biased. That said, I've used Mobil 1 Synthetic oil in most of the grades for many cars over the past decade, and in addition to the oil filter, they are the best quality out there. How do I know? I don't know, but the expert reviews almost always put the oil at the top and the filter in the top 2-3 made. How can any lay person know otherwise? Good enough for me.
B00681BFJU|1|Did not work for 2003 Mercury Marauder
B0089M8BE8|4|Good product, delivery was good, just don't expect seller to answer your questions. Came with everything needed for the install. Dash off and on switch to be located left of the steering wheel, easily installed. Definitely would recomend.
B00TRQUTG8|5|Awesome product!! Easy installation instructions and great night time back light. Ill definitely buy another one
B004FG1D6U|5|Wanted a flower for by 2000 bug - now it's complete.
B00RZ4YWI0|3|These are advertised as SPST switches, but are in fact SPDT. What does this mean? For the vast majority of people using this product, nothing. It will probably just work for your needs. However, if you're connecting an energized source to the 'load' pin, WATCH OUT. When you turn the switch 'off', the 'earth' and 'load' pins are connected.<br /><br />Most people are connecting a battery to 'supply', and a passive load to the 'load' pin, which operates just fine if it gets connected to 'earth' (instead of left hanging, as a SPST switch would do). My plans for this switch were to use it as a disconnect from a charging circuit for a battery. In my case, the 'supply' pin is connected to the float charger, 'load' to the battery's positive terminal, and 'earth' to a common ground. Sparks flew, and I began to question the validity of my EE degree while troubleshooting the issue, until I figured out these switches were shorting my battery+ to ground.<br /><br />In summary, if you have a passive load that would be just fine if it were to be connected to 'earth', these switches will do the trick.<br />If your load shouldn't be connected to 'earth', find another switch.<br /><br />I do like the LEDs though.
B0033WDGH6|3|The engineering efforts that went into the mount must have consumed a full 30 seconds of time! This is the most awful mount I have seen to date. There is only ONE way to mount the unit. The customer can't even rotate the trunion bracket around 180 degrees. How long would it have taken to make the bracket more flexible? (Maybe 60-90 seconds....?)  So only 3 stars for the horrible mount with NO options. I had to cut a portion of the storage 'cubby' to accommodate the unit. It took a few hours to complete as the entire right side dash had to come out.  Five stars for the electrical portion. It works well, and is easy to calibrate. The LED display gives ample instant feedback as to how much braking assist is applied to the trailer. Nicely done! (Perhaps they went over budget on the electrical design) LOL
B001KS25VS|5|These work great on my '06 Mini Cooper S. I tried some of the more gimicky one peice blades, but these work far better and the price can't be beat.
B001DCL2J2|5|Great....
B00MB0E1WK|3|It's really cute, but not as comfortable as I'd hoped. The material also piles and sheds.
B0000AXU02|4|they do what there made to do cover the plug
B003UT3S6Q|4|Was on a friend's birthday list. Was a convenient purchase.
B00QVO5A90|3|can give a fair review as i bought them and just set them on the self of then i break one on the small trailer that i have..
B0043063JU|5|Couldn't be more pleased with this purchase! Feels great on our feet, looks good and is very easy to clean and move. Extremely happy!
B000BZG64I|5|As described, no issues, ordered 2, worked for both Bank 1 and bank 2 on 1998 Infiniti I30.
B000HBID8S|5|works great apply to both sides for best result
B009RC2HVC|5|bought this for someone else.. he likes it.
B00029WSX6|5|This is the second time I've bought this mirror. I purchased one in 2003 for my first new car and loved it. I purchased another one for my &#34;new&#34; 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport. Once you have one of these, it's hard to go back.<br /><br />The clarity of the dimmed mirror is great, it installed relatively easily, and the instructions were clear. It's helpful to have a factory wiring diagram for your car to assist with finding the ignition-switched wire you want to use. The map lights are a nice extra convenience, even if you already have overhead lights. The thermometer is relatively accurate as long as you mount it away from a heat source. I mounted it to the underside of my front bumper so it's away from engine heat, shaded, and has airflow when the vehicle is moving.
B00WH13DJ0|5|It is super soft! It fits snug on my wrist with no fear of coming off super easy!! I have not used this on my car yet because that would require me to go clean it! ha! so I have dusted with it inside my house and it is Awesome!! you have a lot of control because it is on your hand not an extension of your hand. It collects so much dust and got any water and kept it soaked up! I would buy another when this one gets too old! It comes in plastic wrapped to ensure it arrives clean and pretty!<br /><br />*Disclaimer: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my HONEST opinion.
B000EH4V1I|4|works well
B000COWUDY|4|This is a tough review for me.  The muffler is very high quality and fit my '03 Wrangler with 2.25 to 2.5&#34; adapters.  I must say that while it did give a nice deep rumble, it was simply not loud enough for me.  I was looking for something with a little more juice!  I've ordered a Magnaflow glasspack to replace this.  We shall see how it goes.<br /><br />This is definitely louder than stock and the tone is very nice.  On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being obnoxiously loud and 1 being very quiet, I would rate the stock muffler at 1 and this muffler at 3.  Like I said, I'm looking for something more in the 6-8 range.
B001P6GONU|1|The handle broke after one day using it.
B00G24610Q|5|The wrench is useless but otherwise the caps seem to be good quality.
B00HQETDWO|5|High quality and I highly recommend this item. It's like having a residential toilet in your camper - so nice!
B004LX3AS6|5|Works great for storing a car.
B00FJXKE5E|5|Automatic has helped me become a safer and more patient driver all while gaining better mileage and less trips to the pump. IFTTT integration allows all sorts of extended use cases such as never arriving home to a dark home again or having your door unlocked when you come home from the grocery store and your hands are full from carrying everything inside. There are other monitors on the market but have recently become a target of hackers. Because Automatic controls the entire experience, the end result is a security safe product with awesome customer service!
B000E28MSG|5|K&N is the best in my book
B00B0YCD3C|5|Super Duper
B009HDQENS|4|ez to install, does what they are supposed to do. The team should preform as good as the seat belt pads
B000EQ80NE|5|Working just fine.
B003TPFEQS|4|Bought this after a bad experience with an e-mail tune from a supposedly respected aftermarket tuner. Figured I'd go with an OEM tune and parts this time, especially at the cheaper price here on Amazon as opposed to resellers.<br /><br />I received the intake in short order, and followed the instructions for going onto the Ford Racing website to get the ProCal tuner sent to me. The instructions sent with the intake are slightly different than what you'll encounter on the FR site, primarily in that the instructions say you'll need to enter the code from your PCM in addition to your VIN. This is not the case - the website just requires the VIN. The tuner arrived within 2 days.<br /><br />One note - the Ford ProCal tuner is much more limiting than aftermarket tuners. You are limited to changing tire diameter, axle ratio, and octane rating with the ProCal. Other tuners allow much more customization of engine parameters. If you plan to go beyond simple bolt-ons and need more flexibility, you should probably go with an aftermarket tuner and actual dyno tuning. I don't plan on doing much more than I/E on my car, so this is fine with me.<br /><br />The intake itself is high-quality, better than most of the &#34;filter on a pipe&#34; offerings out there. The filter housing &#34;seals&#34; to the hood and draws air from the grille area, rather than drawing from a combination of underhood and fender air. Whether this actually makes any difference is up for debate, but at a comparable price, why not go for the cooler-looking part?<br /><br />Installation is extremely easy with the one exception of needing to swap out the factory clip nut from the ABS controller for a smaller one that comes with the intake. A little tricky, because you have to move the ABS bracket slightly to get the old nut out and new one in. The instructions kind of gloss over this step. Otherwise, it's a 5-minute job. Uploading the tune with the ProCal was straightforward, and took about 15 minutes (most ofthe time was uploading the data). Again, the instructions were not 100% identical to what I encountered, but there was no confusion.<br /><br />As for performance, it does what it's supposed to - it enhances intake sound and provides an incremental performance improvement. The exhaust is slightly louder as well. You'll notice the power the most at the top end, and the engine no longer sounds like it's starving for air as you near redline. The Ford Racing tune basically brings your engine up to Bullit specs, although I'm not sure if it includes the 250RPM increase in redline. If not, you're getting a 5 lbs-ft increase in torque, and minor enhancements to various engine parameters. If so, you'll be up to 315HP from 300.<br /><br />Overall, you might get slightly more torque/HP from an aftermarket tune that pushes the envelope of air/fuel and timing a bit more, but personally I don't think it's worth the risk unless you pay for actual dyno tuning.
B00FF1K7BQ|4|Still using it so it must be good!  Seriously, very nice stuff at a very reasonable price.  Great product for those who take pride in their vehicles.
B00C7Y8LGW|1|The plastic that holds the joints together on the inside is cheap, soft, and falls apart after two weeks- leaving me in the exact same situation as before I bought it but $25 poorer.
B000FOUB8M|5|Great irem. Keeps things secure in the truck bed. Just don't over tighten or uou can bend the bed walls.
B0014BERMG|1|The installation instruction is not clear. Not instruction on air flow direction at all, point up or down?
B00EZUL6ZY|5|Quality
B00D7ZAYI8|2|Instructions on usage were to a web site which was of no help; the device did not work as expected.
B00X2KPAR8|5|Perfect thank you
B00FX40B16|4|The Bosch 40318 SteelTech Wiper Blade 18'&#34; is a real reliable and professionally crafted passenger side windshield wiper that is perfect for drivers in harsh weather.  It was easy to install and it fitted like a glove when I put it on.  I enjoyed the clean wipes it made as it removed all the dirt and grime from my windshield.  If you are looking for an affordable yet well crafted wiper for your vehicle then look no further than the Bosch 40318 Wiper Blade made with SteelTech technology.
B0007ZDRT4|5|cleaned the car used this and brought out the shine used glasscoat and car looks new!
B00MAV0ELW|5|Bought for my Grandson-  he loved it
B00RW7XD1W|5|So far so good. I've only been through a few  rainy days but these wipers preform just like the blades my truck came with.<br />Very clean wipe and no chatter.
B0047VJQ12|1|Doesn't stick to anything for longer than 2 minutes. Ironically enough the shipping address was from CA.
B004QBNA8I|5|Very low price for an oem product
B000PA00XM|5|very good
B00353PWAW|5|Excellent Quality Product
B00TUNSV2W|3|I was mildly surprised to see no ingredients listed on the bottle considering the warnings about being an eye irritant and potential skin irritant.  Still, being touted as a citrus cleaner & degreaser, I figure that the main contents would be stuff like orange and lemon oils (just a guess that could be wildly off) and I know that lemon oils in particular can cause problems on the skin in sunlight.  Since my only boat sank on its maiden voyage (true story - but it was toy boat that I was given for my birthday when I was a kid) I can only use this around the garage and on our cars.  It does a pretty good job of cleaning up oil and grease stains.
B008FSQ13O|5|Easy to install, looks much better than the chrome original or wasting your time plastidipping the original one.
B00NRVF1YE|5|Work great. Awesome costumer service. I had an issue with one of the bulbs. Kensun offered to sent me a replacement with 1 day shipping. I opt out since I wasn't able to replace it right away and took standard shipping. No issues with the replacement I receieved.
B0040DUCGA|5|Fits really nice. improved vison. no distortion.
B008MCZMTM|5|Arrived on time and as described.  DAMN they are big.  I'm gonna plaster one on the tailgate of my truck when it cools off a bit.  Should cover most of it.
B000UUMM6K|5|Easy to install. This product allows me to keep the vent in my travel trailer open to vent out the heat without rain getting in.
B007AOQW24|5|Similar to the rear cargo liner I purchased of the same brand.  The fit is excellent.  I think they will do a better job of containing the mess of winter than the Honda mats, which I had in my '07 Accord and my wife has in out '10 Odyssey.  The Honda mats are also of good material and fit very well.  But they lack the side lips that these liners have, that will help protect the carpet from run off.  Just to be clear, they are not rubber or rubber like.  They are made of some resin type material, but still have a nice appearance when installed.
B0024ECC3S|3|Flimsy, cheap materials. Its ok to cover tanks.
B00KTHXYO8|4|After 10 years the little ring that holds the key's ring broke.  I went to the big Toyota dealer and he told me that the only replacement was a whole new remote that would be $70 with activation.  Came to Amazon and found this for $9.00 with Prime shipping.  Putting the guts of the old one into the new case took about a minute.  Over and done.  I ordered it about 7:00 pm.  and it was delivered before 10:00 the next a.m.  Amazon working at it's best.
B00496ILZC|5|LARGER CAPACITY FILTER. THANKS FRED PFIESTER
B003TTL0TE|2|does not hold suds that good.
B0093NAAY6|5|Literally plug and play. Just need to remove some plastic panels to conceal the wiring, plug the connector in to an open port, and press in a fuse. Super easy to install. Only basic tools needed. No wire splicing or guesswork.
B00B3P0V78|5|really cute have it on my car
B000YB4IYO|1|The product is good BUT:I ordered 2XL and a M.  The medium package had a M jacket and 2XL pants.  Ridiculous.  The M jacket was to big for my wife, so I thought I would expedite things and just have them send back a size S suit for her.  DESPITE my writing to them and a note in the box I just received a size M suit back.  NOW I HAVE TO SEND IT BACK AND GET THE SMALL.  Are these orders handled by machines??? Does know one read messages from the consumer??  Again....RIDICULOUS!!!
B00HAOXYHU|5|goof fit and solved the problem when most hubs cost 5 times more
B0017OANWI|3|These were nice and bright when I bought them in Dec 2013. Were a decent upgrade until 1 went out last month. Got about 19 months of use out of em. Seems a little short lived to me.
B00T222758|5|Has three operating functions triggered by a dark night:  On continuously, &#34;rotating&#34; effect and finally,  blinking.  I guess &#34;Off&#34; is the fourth function.  When I put it on my moored sailboat it was the brightest light in the bay.  Two &#34;D&#34; cells power the light.  I am extremely happy with the product and my friends are headed to Amazon to get one for themselves.  UPDATE:  I bought the white light version, not the amber.
B00OXSX6CE|5|Works great with my Garmin Nuvi.  Simple design and easy to set up for use.  A sun shade is often a necessity depending on the position of the sun.
B007JKPUUE|5|I loved it.
B00HCVRPY4|2|I liked the idea of 2 hooks together but the ends come apart every time I hang my purse! it's like the caps at the ends are detached. No matter how hard you put them back in place!! They come loose next time!
B001HATY36|5|Very well made.

B00EM8944O|5|Wow is all I can say! I had three scratches on my vehicles door panels and I was in the process of turning in the vehicle at the end of my lease. Quotes for repair came in at $685.00 for repair and paint of the areas before lease turn in.  A former body shop guy told me at an auto store to try the 3M kit which is somewhat hard to find is on Amazon. I used the kit and in less than 20 minutes all scratches were gone. I showed someone else that knew of the scratches and they could not see them at all.  My vehicle is silver and the person I showed the scratch to said to try it on his dark blue car. The scratches came out of the blue car as well, except one scratch. What I learned is that if the scratch is very deep almost down to the primer this kit will help reduce make the scratch not as noticeable but not fully make the scratch go away. My silver vehicle had scratches past the clear coat and just at the start of the paint but never went as deep as the primer. This stuff is a miracle worker buy it, trust me it works!!
B00UGGF8S2|5|Great on road trips. Keeps stuff cold very nicely.
B003SJEJE8|1|CHARGED AND USED IT AS SUGGESTED. IT DIED AFTER A YEAR. WILL NOT BUY THIS MODEL AGAIN. ALSO PURCHASED 2 OF THE YETI 150 UNITS - HERE'S OUR REVIEW: USED THIS YESTERDAY TO JUMP START OUR CAR. OF ALL THE UNITS WE HAVE SEEN, THIS SHOULD HAVE EASILY BEEN ABLE TO DO IT. IT DIDN'T.
B00C0SQH70|5|The price was right on this item and it has performed very well since I got it.  You can't go wrong with this.  The only issue is that it, naturally, is not so good for nighttime riding.  I carry a clear one in my bag to switch out in the evening.
B00N19I7JS|5|QUALITY VINYL,VERY EASY TO INSTALL,IF THEY DO NOT SELL IT,IT IS NOT MADE,FAST SHIPPING AND SERVICE,THANK YOU
B00N3VGPYS|5|Looks like it is built pretty decent, though the case is a very cheap plastic and would of preferred metal but seems everything is plastic nowadays. I installed it and the sensor screwed right into my existing bung. The threads are precoated with I think is anti-seize. The sensor cable is plenty long enough for my application and I probably will end up with a glove box full of rolled up cable. Once I get it running, I will try to update my review here.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After installing the gauge and sensor, I am impressed with the product. It worked and works very well. It does have quite the light show when you first start the car as it boots itself up. The gauge does not start working until the sensor has completely warmed up which is a very short time. I really like the duel display mode with the digital display and the sweeping dial display.<br />This item could be used for a tool if you own more then one vehicle. The only requirement would be to have holes drilled in exhaust pipe with the correct size bung in each for install and removal during test.
B000Q6UHQK|5|worked good
B00QRHDIPY|4|I'm using this and a few others to power some computer fans to help my improperly installed refrigerator, and they work. Personally I think I get more amperage out of the ones I got from Harbor Freight, but this one is in a fabric cover and would work well on a visor in a car etc I think.
B00KHBFRDM|5|Never had a chance to install it but hey, I'll give it 5 stars :)
B000W0RQ8C|5|Fits Perfect on 2015 GMC Canyon crew cab 4x4. Quality made product and easy to lock an unlock.
