B0018OXBMQ|5|Exactly what I expected. Perfect for Amelia Earhart project. Received order in plenty of time. No complaints at all.  Will definitely check here first if we need any more costumes or accessories.
B0012R4X8U|4|I was the hit of St. Patrick's Day with this outfit!  My only problem was getting the right size. I am a 6 or 8 and I ordered the small (2-8). I couldn't even get it over my shoulders. I had to send it back ($12 in shipping) and re-order the size large (10-14). I was credited with the cost of the costume, but not for the shipping ($20) and then when the second one came, Canada Customs wanted another $11 in duty. It ended up being a very expensive costume.   My advice, order way bigger than you think because it's easier to alter if it's too big!!!
B00EZMY4SI|3|Good quality but a little small & very low cut
B007NOEWV4|5|If I were reviewing just for looks, this little red gem would qualify for five stars. But in addition to its good looks, it is made exactly the right size to keep all my credit cards, driver's license, etc. The wallet/box snaps open and closed easily, the bright red color makes it easy to find in the bottom of my handbag, and it even feels nice and cool to the touch. I am assuming that it does its major job of keeping my cards RFID protected.which is its major purpose
B0024W4TXQ|5|Great patch was surprised by the craftsmanship of this patch and all the other patches I bought. Definitely going to buy more
B0020ML3F2|5|Daughter loves the socks. She wears them for basketball. They fit perfectly and do not fall down when she runs!
B005CSNVXS|4|Good fit, comfy.
B00ESMW5EU|5|The dress is beautiful !!!! I'm so happy I found this site !!! My daughter love it !! Thanks Richie house !! The picture does not do justice ! Is better looking in person !!
B00EQQH8YU|4|Got this as a gift for my girlfriend; not many Palermo fans around. Excellent fit, nice design. Delivery took about a week. You buy what you pay for. Only downfall is that the shirt was a little too long; otherwise good purchase.
B000NZW3IY|1|I am very skeptical about this product. There are lots of glowing reviews here on Amazon claiming that it endows the wearer with special powers -- sexual, magical, and otherwise. But I can't tell you how many pills I've bought over the Internet that make the same claim, and have been disappointed in, over and over. Seriously, at best you get a slight itchy feeling from them, at worst ... well, without going into details that I'm legally unable to share due to a court order, let's just say they've put a damper on my romantic activities, solo or otherwise.    So while I don't actually own this item, I just wanted to warn other customers who might buy the T-shirt based on these reviews ... beware. Not everything sold on the Internet is what it's claimed to be. I learned this the hard way, many many times.    I'll probably buy the T-shirt anyway, just for the rocking picture though. That alone is worth the price.
B001CDLTLI|4|I like this coat.  High quality and I like the lining.  It is warm coat with well thought out pockets; inside, hand-warmer, chest and bellows.  I'm faily tall (6'1\\"), but not tall enough to where tall sizes, so I found the sleeves just slightly shorter than I care for.  This is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  Also, it would be nice if the snaps for a optional hood would work with a Carhart hood, they don't, but that is minor.
B00JGG7K4I|5|This was a wonderful purchase for the price! Great for those days I'm not feeling a bikini but don't want to look dowdy either. I'm a 34DD/DDD and was worried about under-boobage showing but the bust-level stripe covers everything aside from a little cleavage. I am 5'7 size 6 (sometimes 8 in tops) and an XL fits perfectly. It's not the highest quality swimsuit out there but is absolutely worth the low price I paid.
B009ETEGE4|5|This is a statement piece! The color and texture variations make this visually very appealing. It's not a winter scarf, but I am going to combine it with a purple wool scarf so I can continue to wear it.
B00CEM3YB4|4|Works well and is easily adjustable. Some reviews I read before I purchased the belt indicated they had a difficult time with getting the buckle to close easily.  I had no problems by following the directions included.
B00BG01O2G|1|Received the item, bought as a gift for my daughter, opened it to place money inside and the zipper pull broke immediately.<br />First use: broken. Useless.<br />Poor quality, DO NOT BUY.<br />Returning for a refund.<br />Junk.
B00KD6RIHO|4|Like it but it does shrink after washing.
B002R0FGKK|1|Not big girls
B008REU16E|5|Beautiful well made my grandaughters wearing a different one each day,,,, My God dsughter will not be seen without hers..adds that pretty girl touch to any hair do
B003DKTNKC|5|I always buy these, and it lasts long too. I would recommend any guys who has taste for boxer briefs
B003DPR41W|2|There is a strange yellow paint dusting all over the hat that stains fingers yellow. It looks dirty and isn't as clean looking as in the picture.
B000TGWFNK|1|I washed then once and they already started to tear on the waist band.  I would not recommend these.
B00TLGUZGS|5|Loved them
B00IX4WU3K|5|love the fit and use the stripes as a rule in how deep my son can play in the water before i stand beside him
B00H2XHZ24|5|I like it
B005GLH64G|5|Awesome pants! Comfortable, forgiving and move with me when I work as a pediatric PT. Highly recommend them!! I'm going to get more! Waistband is super comfortable
B00DYRIOC2|5|Son loves his new shirts
B006JPLY2I|5|We ordered these pins for my granddaughter to trade at DW, but they were so adorable that she decide to keep them!
B008CON4WW|5|For the price of this suit, and the quality of the fabric and workmanship was more than I expected. for the price I thought I couldn't go wrong and probably wear it in my pool, but it's so cute I will be excited about wearing out on the beach!!
B0016LDLZI|4|Color fades fast but the fit is perfect.
B00DOEULSU|2|Way too small for a normal person.  I am extremely disappointed.  Cannot believe this was marketed and sold as one size fits all, they BARELY fit on my10 year olds head and I can't even let her have them because they will give her a headache they are so tight.  They weren't exactly cheap either.  A total rip off.
B00VKXUFUQ|4|Very reasonable and fitted as expected
B004HSN6U2|5|Great quality.  It's beautiful.  The length is good for my height with wedges, 5'4&#34;, it's a bit long for flats.
B00BWM88IG|5|Really nice costume item.  Fits well and my 10 year old loves, loves, loves it.
B002C00UDI|4|Great costume, went over well with my son as Robin!
B00T0J9VQ6|5|Fit great without a swim diaper.  Love this suit.
B002YY4MRM|5|Looks really nice given the price.
B00NCX14AC|2|I really wished this wouldve fit since its just the right amount of heavy and so pretty! But the bottom flairs out so much and the pockets are so bulky that there is zero shape. It made my lower half look like the penguin from Batman. I only need a large because of my biceps not my body. I was hoping the jacked would be straight instead of flared out.
B003X26SA8|4|Really well made
B00C072MPC|5|Very sexy sexy
B00DGWRTN0|5|Great shirt. Soft material.
B00K5NV9SY|2|Great dress but tiny on the top. Way too small.
B00LFIAMIQ|5|the product is bad. This unfortunate. The control moves alone does not obey. It was a bad buy
B00SQSE98W|1|The bra is fine but you have to order maybe 4 sizes bigger than your actual american size. I am thin, I am 5'6 ft (1.66 mts) tall and my weight before pregnancy was 120 lbs, my bra size was 32 B. So I read all the reviews because it looked so pretty and I really wanted it. I am 8 months pregnant and I have only gain 15 lbs. so I am 135 lbs now and my breasts have not changed a lot in size reason for the one I keep using my same bras from before pregnancy. So after reading the reviews I ordered 2 sizes bigger, a 36. And it is still too little. The straps are all the way down but they are too short, and I am not a tall woman, just average, and you can not change them. It did close but with the tiny straps it brings my breast to my neck...So the fit is not just small or too small it is extremely too much very EXTRA SUPER SMALL ! If u still want to try like I did go 4 sizes bigger.
B007DL93V6|5|I love this dress. The fabric is kind of like a fluffy soft towel. The fit is perfect, accentuates my curves, is the perfect length (not too long, not too short). The pink color is girly and cute and all things wonderful. I only wish the back was a bit lower cut to show off the shoulders and upper back more as well as to keep me cool. Great purchase.
B00DOYEAW8|3|This dress is cute.  However I tried a size down from my normal French Connection size and it was still too big in the chest area.  Other than that it was cute.  I was disappointed it didn't fit properly.
B00MM3OVQM|5|dissapointed ppl in the reviews lie on hiwfast items get to one...like 4 days after shiiping a week after shipping i messaged the owners to get before halloween and its not possible it will get before next friday.... post reviews with. truth and not lies...now a little girl i know will be sad without a dress...so dissapointing i really thought it would arrive in a week and two days
B00QNVEZHE|5|Great shirt! Nice slim fit so easy to swim in and great visible color for water parks. Goes with most color shorts
B00C9T216G|5|great jacket super comfy,  it even keeps me nice and warm up here in Watford, ND in these super cold winter months.  and I only wear a light long sleve
B0078E8WR4|1|Looks tacky and cheap, feels tacking and cheap as well. I would return it but seeing as it was inexpensive I don't really care. It's going right to the garbage can.
B00AKATPJW|4|The top has nice coverage.  I wish I had gotten something with a more traditional halter since this narrow style isn't my absolute favorite.. but it does offer another &#34;tan-line&#34; variation.. so I can get sun where my tank top hits.  It is cut nicely and drapes well.. I think it is flattering on my body.. which isn't stick thin.
B00EZVLS56|5|So soft, breathes very well.  These are by far my favorites to wear for any occasion. They are good for hot days because they are thin, good with sports because they are supportive, and they stay in place.
B00DST5PJG|4|comply with such requirement as it was brand new with their seals the color requested and there was no variation in the displayed image
B004RBEBFI|5|These are very comfortable leggings.  They are nice and thick so they cover little lumps and bumps just fine.  Love this brand and really don't buy much else in jeans and pull-on pants.  These are great.
B00BBB9K5I|5|Adorable
B00NYGAMDW|2|I ordered XL and it was like for an 8 year old, plus I had to pay $10.00 for return shipping
B00LI1BC4I|3|Nice jeans, a little to thick and not as high rise as I thought. Just to heavy for Orlando fl. I returned them.
B00HANJWB8|5|My godson & his wife wanted the bunting to be a little large. Perfect & great Christmas gift!
B00MVEUSBY|5|I'm a middle aged lady, so sometimes wearing tights in the winter is a little too warm.  These with boots and a dress are adorable.  I'm also tall, so they don't scrunch as much as the picture on me, but they fit just great all the same.
B0064R922U|1|Great colors, Won't STICK NO MATTER WHAT!  And the shape & great metallic color makes it impossible to sew on. Ugh.
B0095ZL9YC|4|wanted to send you pic but no option here.  The item looks exactly like the picture amazon has and looks good on.  Was a gift and they sent a pic wearing it so the size and the look was good.
B00D7NIVRG|4|The material is nice on these, and the dark green color wasnt sheer or anything, they were too short though and I gave them to my younger brother
B004XM551U|5|It's a great novilty hat it has a stretch band so it fits every head
B00JLZNDFY|5|After reading through the reviews, I ordered this 2 sizes up and it is just a bit big on me, but with perfect sleeve length, which is hard to find with being nearly 6' tall.  It is more of a jacket than a hoodie, so I think it will be perfect since I will have something else under it.  I purchased the fleece version.  The color is true to the picture and the fabric is thick and very warm.  Like another reviewer said, the pockets are a little weird and bulky, I will probably remove them.  I look forward to wearing this when the weather cools off, and am definitely looking at ordering more!
B005GW7OD8|2|Just cut way too small..
B00AH3BUNG|3|A very bright color--too bright.  Reasonable quality, but nothing special.  Equal or better can be found at stores.  Meant for a smallish person.
B00KRYOWRQ|3|adequate shirt, but runs small.  Do size up (I like a loose fit).
B0027AGOLK|5|these were the right fit and very comfortable
B0035YH5YC|5|This brooch is beautiful.  I bought it for stage wear and under the lights it glistens.  So well packed and well made.  I've gotten many compliments on it.
B00CCJ1YCK|5|I especially LOVE this one because math was (and always will be...) my kryptonite!!  :-)
B00C59WE3U|4|I purchased these for my son (29&#34; waist) but I ended with them (33&#34; waist). They are comfortable but they are not sized correctly.
B00QTSDQ6M|2|The color is not Red white and blue but orange, white and black.  The blue bottoms i bought do not match.  so disappointed.
B00HNKWT2C|5|Cute whole fabric is super soft ! I recommend it !
B004WP64AY|5|Seriously the best Carhartt I have ever bought.  Absolutely love it its super warm and the quality is high.  Plan on getting years out of this one.
B000UVHQ60|3|when presents were put in, I heard the stitching attaching the cord to the bag start to tear
B001M2CWWY|4|I ordered these in black.  They came in on time and were in good condition.  However it is clear why they are so cheap.  Just fleece wrapped around a plastic frame.  They aren't adjustable nor are they foladable/easy to stow away. They do keep my ears warm so I am happy.
B00O1OTM96|5|Great high rise. Love the back pockets, not to big.
B00IAPCOC4|5|Bought this for my new daughter in law to be. She loved it and it really is so pretty and well worth the money
B00A1AJE3I|4|I get compliments on this dress every time I wear it.  That being said, it fits a little &#34;boxy&#34; and it falls at knee length on me (I'm 5 2, so yes, I'm short!) but is really well made, love the colors!  The exposed green zipper on the back is a nice touch.
B00K1XXL7K|5|Love the color and the shirt is soft to the skin.
B00J99726S|4|so it's nice  to be able to stock up for winter ware
B00VUT6LO4|5|The top while as shown and described was shorter than expected.  It requires a tank top underneath unless you like your 12 year old baring her about 6 inches of her mid-riff with arms raised.  Otherwise the outfit is cute and fits well for the size that was ordered.  It was worth the money spent and came quickly
B00NXO93K8|4|I had hoped they would come over my knees but they dont.  also make sure you notice that they are coming from over seas.
B00VWFTJJK|4|Torso is a little shorter than I would have liked, but I love it! It makes me look and feel sexy!
B009CCRL6I|2|Do keep your feet warm but I wore only about 6x so far and just inside a shoe not while walking on floor and the bottoms seem like they are starting to fade already
B00D7UX1YM|4|Some of the credit csard holders were too small orthe ards were too large, they would not fit. However I like the looks and feel.
B00BOUMKCQ|2|I was looking forward to receiving these. They are way too small.
B009I51JXA|5|gift
B00B5UDV1E|4|Fits somewhat small on me, but this is by far the best adhesive bra I've found. Great all-day hold despite me being out and moving around. Unfortunately the adhesive loses some of its grip after the first five or so wears, but I can usually get 10-15 wears out of each one.
B001FOR3HI|5|i bought this wallet and it was set to be delivered by november 3 but it came 2 days early and it is great.i was paranoid at first because my husband is soo tall and i didnt know if the chain was long enough but he said it is perfect and he loves it. great wallet for the price.
B00DVHUB8A|1|The color is completely different. I ordered a pink T-shirt, and I got an orange one.
B00VF3ZC5Y|5|This is a great deal and its fits perfectly for my little sister
B00EVAZ2HQ|5|cotton and is very fresh and modern. recommend buying
B00LT7NM5I|4|Ok
B00M2HQ5OO|2|Very cheap quality. Not really functional for swimming.
B00PAT2YMI|5|I loved it but haven't sent it to him yet!
B00M0L42N8|4|Not as bright as expected.
B00F6QR8A8|5|As Described
B005OFLSOS|5|Outstanding
B00FL204FS|1|One size fits no one unless you are flat and made of cardboard. Terrible materials, synthetic junk with no shape.
B00UFU2HPG|4|Can't beat the price but the pockets in these are not as deep as the two other, almost identical, styles i have bought from this manufacturer. I wouldn't keep my keys in them that's for sure.
B002ABLIHQ|4|The jacket is a good fit. I bought a different cut from another company and when comparing, I feel this jackets neckline/opening is a little too wide (just a personal prefernce). Easy to wash, shipped fast.
B00HSSSOB4|2|Felt good but the color dye was streaked
B000XF0ZR0|4|Very lightweight and slightly chincy, but worked for its purpose as part of an 18 month olds cowgirl Halloween costume.
B00E1SPYWG|5|i love it fits perfect
B004MNKCJ0|1|One of the worst<br />Dont waist your money
B008LWVW8S|3|2x jackets this time were smaller than previous dickie jackets that i ordered in the past.....
B000IBNCN8|5|On time delivery. Warmest socks I've ever owned! Wore them at the barn for over 9 hrs. Rode horseback for 4hrs I was never cold. Washed well& kept their shape. Stocking up on them for sure!
B007O3TBMY|2|Returned it. Did not meet my expectations for decent coverage. Cleavage too low; skirt too short. I would recommend only to very small women who don't mind &#34;letting it all hang out.&#34;
B00J568NXQ|5|Love it!
B00U8LZX12|1|Runs small and doesn't provide any comfort
B00DNO2VH0|5|This is a good value well made jacket.  Looks a classy brand.  I would recommend this purchase over others you might see at maceys for example
B0074DM7J8|4|Super comfortable. Fit and wash well. Not much better quality though than what you'd get at Target, and not as cheap.
B00KQVERX4|5|Firstly, the undies were really packed well. I love how it feels when I touch the fabric used. Its smooth and feels comfortable wearing them. You can not go wrong with ARMANI
B000B5GV2U|5|This beanie looks and feels awesome, it fits my head perfectly and its fairly warm too. I can't wait to go snowboarding with this thing.
B00PMOKKOU|1|Way too small. I will be giving this to a 10 year old
B00VS4NJ1O|5|This skirt came quickly and looks just as pictured. I received several compliments on it when I wore it Sunday! It is really pretty. It's a little bigger than I thought it would be, but it still works. I totally recommend it!
B00KNP5LWO|1|Its runs big, but it's really nice
B00CQBMGYY|5|Bought these for a 6 year old as a gift. They worked out marvelously!
B00CBEZPWQ|5|Originally I ordered a large,but found after washing it got bigger in the body.So I decided to try a medium and it had plenty of room. The arms and body have lots of room so you do not have the binding effect when doing any job. Like a lot of other sweatshirts this one gives you free movement in any position that you have to be in to complete the job at hand. Inside is very warm with just a heavy shirt underneath the sweatshirt. Zipper is very heavy and durable. I was very surprised by the rain defender aspect because it really works and seem like it will last for sometime. As usual Carhartt makes a great product for men or women who works and play out doors. I highly recommend this product.
B009D63E3C|5|Perfect!
B003JORP1Q|4|I got this wallet for a friend and when it arrived I hesitated  to give it to her because I though it was real pretty only thing was that it doesnt hold much
B005SOKCWO|1|I bought these because I have a pair of similar glove/mittens that were purchased at REI.  However, these definitely did not live up to those.  Why you say?  Well, they are warm.  They look fine.  But the mitten is too short to cover the fingers.  I was cleaning snow off of my car windows and it just packed into the mitten freezing my fingers.  NOT what I'm looking for!  NOT worth any amount of money unless you never plan to use the mitten in which case just buy fingerless gloves.
B0038NIDU0|4|Perhaps my head is &#34;big&#34; - but seems a bit snug - and I am not sure i'd be able to wear a bun with it if I wanted to do so (I have long hair) because of the relatively snug fit.  So will be flowing locks under the hat.<br /><br />The hat itself seems great quality for the price.  Wearing to '20s wedding this weekend - should work nicely.
B00MIU6BPI|5|Buy this for my husband. He wears the shirt at work, and really loves it
B00HRIKHCE|1|Tore easily, it was small and see though, and while just trying it on the armpits ripped. will not buy again!
B009LIMFAA|4|GREAT!!!!
B00EK5RNT2|4|This suit works well, it is starting to get worn out in the back a bit.
B00I05A4OO|4|i like it
B0083QNQZY|5|It was just what I needed for my dress and it stayed in place all night :) I used the side stick tape.<br />Just as described and fit well based on the chart given.
B00C7CO89S|2|I'm not Charlie Kelly so wearing shirts with wolves on 'em ain't my thing. I love RVCA, I just wish I would have had that epiphany before buying this shirt and looking at myself in the mirror. Whatever. Work/sleep shirt now.
B007O3SMJM|4|Glitter does get everywhere. However, the costume is so cute. For a costume costing under 30$ it's totally worth it.
B00B8Y3COI|5|Awesome shirt and it arrived faster than expected.  Love it!
B00A7IFTN8|5|I freaking love this hoddie its warm and nerdy at the same time! I highly recommend any of tokidoki's products they are all high quality.
B00VK05YKU|5|Nice fit. light weight for summer use.
B00DKN4924|2|This is the second DNKE kilt I have ordered. The first I returned immediately, as after taking it off for the first time two of the buttons pulled through the fabric. These kilts are made in Pakistan and I figured that there may be substantial variability in the construction of these kilts. I returned the first and ordered another one. This second kilt has served me well for a good week of use, though by the end of the week, one of the buttons had pulled through the fabric and another is on its way. After my experience with the first kilt, I was extremely careful not to stress the buttons when unbuttoning it, however, even this is not enough. Expect very poor construction and a short life-time on these kilts. From my conversations with other kilt wearers, my impression is that the American made brands are much more durable.
B00DUUXAYK|1|It's quality is so bad!!! I advice you not to waste your money on this product! And it is too short!
B00NPXX1B4|5|I bought this jacket last year for my son and loved it. I wanted the same one this year and easily found it on Amazon.
B00NHH9EGE|3|The sweater is well made, but make sure to order a size smaller than you normally would.
B00DWN7VTU|5|Very pleased with the purchase.  Great fit, very comfy and cool colors.  They have held up to the first several washes.
B00006LFHG|5|I recently spotted this sweater in both red and brown at the store, however, was pleased to find it online in a charcoal grey.  Classy sweater, which can be worn buttoned up, or split down for two different looks.  Great buy!  Tends to run a little larger, so I advise buying the smaller size if you're caught between a S &amp; M, or M &amp; L.
B00L3FRQ1W|5|I freaking love it - the best wallet I've owned so far !!
B00SMX13R6|5|Good quality and my very picky son likes it.  I'm happy with my purchase.
B00KNSEKCI|3|quality is great but sizing is very slim fitting. the legging very slim for baby best to buy 1-2 sizes bigger than you would normally use
B00OAUDTMW|4|This was a very cute suit!  My only problems with it were that I dint like a halter strap ( can't stand anything on my neck) and us wanted a one piece suit.  I would have kept this if not for the halter strap.  Very flattering!
B008MUMVMK|4|Like the other Andy & Evan clothes we've tried, the craftsmanship is excellent--attention to detail, strong seams, etc.<br /><br />The problem was the fit. The arms were too long (and we didn't have this problem with other brands), so we had to cuff the sleeves. The rest of the fit was loose around the middle, but fit fine in the shoulders.
B00DRC2XLM|5|It is good, I love it, and I will come back to buy it again!
B000U9V46A|2|I dont know what I was expecting for $15....but this was below expectations. Very cheap material. I dont expect to keep this belt.
B00IWJBK4G|5|Adorable....color is a little more pinker that picture but it's still a pretty color. I went with the reviews and got a medium when I normally wear a small and it was perfect!
B004UTCJQU|3|I was excited to get my frame and quickly my boyfriend pointed out to me that it was just stickers on a metal frame... Nothing special. I didn't want to go through the process of returning and paying for shipping so I just kept it.
B00EQEAZLU|5|It is a very pretty skirt, hangs well and very comfortable, classy looking, looks great with boots.  Great for summer and winter.<br />I love it.
B00I1LOTW0|2|fabric quality is not so good..
B00I0UKFU2|4|Sexy cute and well fitting.  Great price!
B009DJCHK0|5|I work outside in scrubs, and my synthetic sports bras were giving me some unpleasant back acne. When I looked for cotton sports bras to have some breathability for my poor skin, these popped up. Without realizing it, I ordered 2 sets of these bras, but man am I glad I did! They are very comfortable and even flattering with the deep V neck. My skin is already a lot clearer, too!
B00IT3YZNS|5|The t-shirt is very cool.  The graphics are spectacular.  I'm blind so I must rely on the description of others.<br /><br />Steve Loutherback<br />and Carmen Hanratty
B008L0HC98|5|If you have an expandable belly, this product is for you. Variable measurements is not a problem for the vast majority of people, but if you change your waistline frequently, look no more, here is the solution, one extra inch on each side.
B0007NIDO0|5|Fits well and is comfortable.
B00LN0DLN4|5|these are gorgeous well made of corsets that will leave you looking ready for your best night, either with your husband, or a hot night on the town, these corsets are sure to never disappoint. friendly excellent customer service these people are easy to deal with they will always leave you happy
B008500I8Q|5|I love these pants! They are about ankle length which you'd expect from the picture but I'm tall and nothing that says ankle length usually is, so you'd imagine how pumped I was when I tried them on and they fit. They're great with boots. Dress them up or down. And they're stretchy so if you're lazy like me, once you squeeze yourself into these pants, the wrinkles pretty much disappear ;) No iron needed woohoo!
B001RFG5U6|4|Hey, what do you want for five bucks?  The best is as described, and is a perfect size.  Great for everyday wear with jeans around the house and outside.  Oddly enough, mine came with an unexpected buckle.  Who knows?
B00BUKSJSY|5|Good Sizing
B005X6PQB4|4|The color is nice and used on hot time is good. But, like usual on this brand, buy a size over.
B00ACMNFYY|2|The sock was more of a lycra texture, not soft cotton, like I was imagining.  The socks fit fine for one wearing for my baby, who can only sit (so there wasn't much movement.) After the 1st wash the sock is all out of shape and stringy.  It even looked worn in some places.  If you  need this sock for only a few times-  it works.  Otherwise, find something else.
B00GPTFJKQ|5|I love these so much. I actually got my whole school wearing them because they're so cute. I'm 6'0 and I weight 165lbs. My legs are pretty much the skinniest part of my body. So the fit wasn't a problem. But I let my friend borrow them a couple times and she's shorter than me, but has bigger thighs than me, so it was a little harder for her to get a good fit.<br />They fit perfectly on skin alone or over nylons (wearing them over nylons will hurt your toes after a while though). They DON'T SLIP. Even when I'm wearing them with nylons.<br />Overall-- I'm able to get the socks to just under mid-thigh (long legs), while my friend can get them to just under where I can get them. So you'll get the best results if you have thinner legs.<br />***Just a tip. I wouldn't recommend putting them in the dryer, because it seems to affect the material.
B00JBKGG8U|5|Perfect!
B003NX8CPQ|5|Purchased this jacket for my wife she loves it I liked it so well I purchased a men's for myself
B000NWJMX6|5|These jeans are the perfect fit for the mature woman with curves.  The boatcut jeans are just the right length for a tall girl like me.  I get so many compliments when I wear them.
B007JA9TG0|5|Too cute!
B00MGBWM7K|5|These pj's are great.  We live in a hot climate so didn't want anything too thick.  These are light pj's so they are perfect.
B005SN0BJO|5|Definitely one of my favorite brands of jocks. The pouch provides plenty of support and the straps are barely noticeable. Be warned, however, that they will shrink if you do not take proper care of them. Wash them in cold water and air dry if possible. If you must tumble dry, do it on a low setting and remove them promptly. Luckily mine never shrank, but a friend of mine has lost many Diesel jocks due to ill care.
B00KWM5X4E|4|purchased for my mom
B00N4OHLWE|1|It says in both the title and description that the hat is made of 100% wool.<br /><br />The tag on the inside clearly states that it is a 65% poly, 35% cotton blend. Since the item came to me crushed (very disappointing), I thought I could use blocking, a cool iron and starch to straighten out the kinks as you would with any wool hat, but since it's a cotton/poly blend, it only curled and warped as I tried to get it back into a hat-shape.<br /><br />I get angry when lied to, and even though it's just a dumb hat I think that the seller should be held accountable for their inaccurate description.
B00NAT98BA|5|The shirt fits perfectly on my skinny child, if a little long. The colors are beautiful and the stitching is lovely. The cap sleeved are adorable, and there are side panels to prevent too much chest/ribs from showing. Would absolutely buy again.
B00KGH2F28|4|Adorable pjs. True to advertised picture. Soft cotton fabric that's thin enough to be worn during summer as well as winter. Colors have not faded even after repeatedly being worn and washed. Fits true to size.
B0056G1DWC|5|I purchased this for my wife to combat the freezing Wyoming winters when sometimes you just can't get warm enough.  She absolutely loves it!  It's the typical heavy duty Carhartt sweatshirt that we know and love with an extra bonus, pockets!  It fits comfortably over another shirt and the sizes are accurate.
B004A7XYBQ|2|I bought these panties to have some inexpensive ones following childbirth, but was disappointed with these.  The cotton is cheap and itchy/crunchy instead of soft.  The colors are not as opaque as I thought they would be.  Honestly, these depress me too much to wear.  I'm not going to bother to send them back, but I would not order them again.
B00DSZIJQG|3|Very pink!  It looks mostly white on the computer screen, but is very pink in person.  A little snug and difficult to get on or out of.  Still pretty, but not as expected.  And a little see-thru in the bust.
B007IM71OQ|3|Very nice style, but way too sheer and delicate.  I only recommend it if it is to be worn lightly.
B000BOG0JA|3|I ordered a 2x and it was not wide enough to cover my private area and if It isnt wide enough to pull up that high on my waist, I can do it, but it takes coverage away from the V area which is already lacking by a half inch to an inch on each side. So order this a size bigger than what you normally wear if you are a larger lady. If you are thin you should have no issues. I would like to return it, but I already opened it and tried it on so I am out of luck I guess.
B001N4OCII|3|Nice Tie but a little too short
B003DC8UBI|5|I'm a small in adults or a 14-16 in kids and I loved it! It's not show threw, I use it for volleyball games and practices and it works great 😊
B0088OP3JS|4|Glad I followed the review to order a bigger size! My husband normally wears an xl but I bought at xxl and it fits perfectly! Shirt itself is so soft and comfortable.
B008A782XC|1|Of poor quality. The metal eyelets pohpped out of the holes after wering it a few times. The belt separated into three layers shortly there after. Hard to tell quality from poor pictures.
B00IFY3MHQ|4|it fits great, everything as expected, but the material is a bit sheer ( i mean the white part ) but still i was happy with it since i have been looking for it for a while and finding it was a delight.
B00899USFQ|5|Love these boyshort pantys.  they fit just right,soft not heavy but feel supportive.<br />size small very good fit. I weigh 108 and I am 4ft 11  perfect fit.
B007TITYP8|5|This is a peferfect holiday dress.  My daughter loves it, it washed well, and it fit her well too.  It looks beautiful on her.
B000VJ7FIK|5|These shorts are the most comfortable shorts I own. The range of motion these shorts allow for climbing make them a great yoga short as well. I own two pair in different colors and use then all the time.
B004SW9LOM|2|Runs small
B00KTGQGT4|5|could not find shorts anywhere in town this time of year...but it's still super hot here for another 2-3 months.  I got 3 pair for my Daughter to go to school in..she hates jeans..these are a good alternative..not too short for school and she is super tall.  She is small size 10..but very talll at 4'9.  The Medium size in these fit good with a little room to grow.
B00HNPJ67I|5|Nice
B011DASMKA|5|Love it. Cant wait to wear it to the gym..!!!
B003AU5VZ6|5|Got the job done.
B004CI8D28|5|I used this on my recent trip to Albuquerque.  It fits an iPad 2 in an [[ASIN:B004X34EIY Incase CL57923 Convertible Book Jacket for the Apple iPad 2 (Black)]], plus a few loose papers and the charger/cable, but not much more.  That's all I wanted to carry around in this shuttle/case anyway.  I've also carried my old Dell X1 plus the charger and a small wireless mouse with no problems.  It has a nondescript yet classy black Samsonite look.  There are pockets inside, and two zipped pockets outside.  I hardly used the shoulder strap, although it is nice to know it is there if I need to use it.  I did not have to take the iPad out of this shuttle while going through airport security, but there was nothing else in the case at the time.  This is probably one of my favorite accessory purchases for my iPad/netbook.  And, it is easy to grab-and-go in the weekends.  Highly recommended accessory for the road warrior's small computing needs.
B00960QZGI|5|Well made and good material my granddaughter loves it. Good for school, she wears a pair of shorts under it but she really likes it.
B009JRGOHS|4|Ordered a larger size because of previous reviews.  Glad I did.  It's just a little big so likely the medium would have been too small.
B007W0XV02|4|This is a super cute design and the molded bra cups are actually good shape and size for my 38DD chest. I didn't expect them the bra cups to be so comfortable. The slip is short, which is good if you want to wear it with a short dress or skirt, but I wish it were a little longer. It is also tighter than I thought it would be, but it is shapewear so I guess that is to be expected. Overall I would buy a bigger size next time.
B0044VEFWK|3|I love the look of this hat, but it was much too small and I have a small head.  I can usually wear children's hats.  If it had been a tad bigger, it would have been perfect and I would have given it 5 stars.  Would be cute for a child.  Nice if you like very snug hats.<br />I will be retuning this since it is much too tight for me.
B00NFXQEYU|2|Based on another review, I bought these, sure that the fit at top would not be too tight.  Alas, it was.
B0081PJFKC|4|I'm a pretty chubby guy so it was a bit tight on my at first, but after you wear into them, they're pretty solid. They feel great, and are pretty flexible. Size runs pretty average. Only bad thing is they shrink a bit when you wash them, so it takes a while to wear into them again.
B00AYZCCD4|5|Son picked this out; he has a hard time finding shirts that fit that are also long enough in the torso. He also likes them to be not flimsy.
B00STXQDQU|5|She loves to think it came from London AND she wears it.
B00KEHXAVU|1|I didn't know that silk touch meant 100% poly.
B0088FT3G6|4|Its awesome
B00J5ZETZ8|5|Love the Giants, love these capris. So comfortable!!
B00GN8CH04|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE,<br /> just what i ordered, evey easy to figure out how it use it will order another
B000F3HFVE|3|Meh, I'm glad I had the foresight to get some things to supplement this.
B00ISAZWYI|1|Fake as DONT buy it say real and<br />stuff don't buy it it's fake
B009USA968|5|The kids at my sons school chose to dress like characters from Phineas  and Ferb for their Halloween Carnival.I actually like it and it fit my son well. Sizing is how it should be.
B00MV4X12M|4|If you are an ample plus size, be careful when buying. The item will fit just fine, but unless you stand at the angle the photo model does with hands in pockets pulling 2 sides of garment apart some, you might not be able to see whatever you are wearing underneath, black in the photo. If you order a size down, you will see more of the undercolor most likely or more easily when worn. Both sizes fit me and might fit you. This is a very soft, comfortable sweater that is just the right length for someone ample but 3'4&#34; and it should be fun to wear. Blue is very pretty. Grey is fine if you like grey. Black ought to be that way also.
B00WGLU920|5|I don't always like Cafe Press t-shirts, but this one is a winner. The graphics are really good, great color, and are on the front AND the back. The blue color is just right, not too light...a subtle blue so you don't feel like a big-giant bluebird walking around advertising tomatoes. Shirt is comfortable, fabric feels good, and the sizing is accurate. It does well re washing and dryer-ing, too. If you are really into heritage tomatoes, Amazon offers a beautiful large book on the Heirlooms, too, with lots of gorgeous pictures.
B003Z3F4RS|5|I love these. They are tight enough yet very stretchy. I sleep in them and wore them constantly during the first weeks off my maternity leave
B0088EYPJM|5|good product.
B00AOUVWSK|2|It is made from a less the desire able material, the edges cut cheeks, it was a horrible size and off color. I had to cut, sew, paint and add cushion to make it wearable.
B007R8T8W4|5|I purchased this after for my son after he lost a hat I had leant him.  This hat was inexpensive and has served him well.  With any luck he will hold onto this hat for sometime.
B0030KKFDE|5|EXCELLENT
B00FO4VQA0|5|I loved it! Very good quality and fit absolutely perfect!! What more could a girl ask for! Friday night little black dress!!
B00GGZOKOA|5|exactly as pictured. it was comfortable, & looked nice over a cardi. i purchased two, so could attach them for a double wrap.
B00DUENU1Y|5|I wore this for 18 hours the first time I put it on. There was no tugging or yanking to keep it up. I totally forgot about it. I am a 34C and the fit is very nice.
B003BX67FK|5|I love it ;)
B00CJRV3Z8|5|The fit is just perfect.  It's perfect for the business day and the length is just right.  So often I buy knee-length dresses that ride up so they end up too short, but that is not at all the case with this dress.  It's got a great jacket that you can pair with other things too (a shirt and some jeans and you're kicking it around town).  I wear this dress to work and I get compliments all day long.
B00FJGNUBQ|3|These shipped quickly and the colors were accurate, and attractive (I ordered white, charcoal and heather beige). However, they fit weigh tighter than similar tanks normally do. The cotton felt kind of rough, not soft, and had no stretch to it. I sent all 3 back.
B0072D7O9I|5|My daughter loves it.
B000FXSV9O|5|They are exactly what he was looking for. Work great for him. Will tell other people about them. Thank you
B00MTYKYFQ|4|Shirt was true to size, pants fit good in waist, but  are about 2-3&#34; too long, still very cute and love them!!
B00CN47HS4|1|It is too large and made cheap.....not impressed with this item.....gave it away as soon as I go it. .bad
B00HZDS0A2|1|Very thin and Completely see through!  I returned these pant immediately.
B003E6OS78|1|Eh....  Either I misjudged my own lung hammers, or these bras just run small!
B0024MUCZA|1|I ordered the TATTOO and the CARTOON wallet came.  Amazon made it right, but very disappointing. I am a fan of Dynomighty wallets, don't get me wrong, I was simply the wrong product came to the door.
B00FMMUGOG|1|Was noticeably small when it arrived. Didn't fit to size like expected...
B00PJVUYRO|4|Great dress, nice fabric and fullness, but too large at the waist for a Large.
B002LFRFNM|5|I got this for my father who was a Marine Core Officer in hopes he would stop yelling at me. It didn't work but he likes the shirt.
B00RSB2I9U|1|Poor quality and materials. Feels like thin paper on your skin. Runs wayyyyyy small.
B000I4SE06|5|Great material, and logo is solid!
B00E9AO8DM|5|Just what needed.
B00A75AHHO|4|Fits on the waist as expected, but a little tight on the legs for my taste, which is surprising considering I am on the lean side. However, the look and feel of the material are great.
B000LJPITS|5|The case fit my Zune like a glove.  The screen protector was a nice touch also.
B00JL5FQHW|2|Fitted more like a 3x
B00KDA8V1W|5|Looks adorable on my son!
B009KUJRJG|5|Great quality and very warm. It is well worth the money. Lots of pockets. Very great jacket for the price.
B00EYNVT9U|5|It's a soft and comfortable basic fleece.  I bought 2 sets and thankfully all 4 were different colors. Good buy for the price.
B00OYSCS1I|4|Fits well, not crazy about the fact that they came in white ONLY....
B00MJB3JCE|5|Cool
B00I7BHO9E|5|My friends and I love the &#34;Girls&#34; Series, so I gave this to a friend for a birthday gift and she was the hit of the party.  A must for any &#34;Girls&#34; fan.
B00EZC3LXW|3|Small is Xsmall. Its asian size.
B00GAZOX0C|3|Very cute but short, quick shipping, you may want to order a size up. Nice for the price!
B00CE1EOUA|5|My friend loved them.
B009FQDWDM|5|Great tiara for playing and Halloween! My 5yr old daughter loves it! I think all little girls should get a chance to be a Princess!
B00YRV6B2Y|5|It  feels  good 😊
B00O97LFL8|5|Nice tie from vineyard vines, at discounted price! My boyfriend loved it
B004ARTQZ4|2|MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS ALLERGIC TO THE COTTON MATERIAL THEY WERE MADE OF.
B00W6ZLLX2|4|Cute, but the top is really large(falls off the shoulders), while the skirt is tighter.
B003UIG206|5|Bought this for my wife hopeing she would wear it for me. Awesome! I loved it. It was very tantalizing to me to see her in it.
B002R5BJ9M|2|First, this is a stirrup, which is what the title says but the picture doesn't appear to be a stirrup.  I assure you, it is a stirrup.  Secondly, these are much flimsier than they appear.  More like a thick pair of nylons.  I won't be using them.  Very cheap.
B0068FE4BM|5|These socks are great!  I love them.  I have washed them several times.  They will definitely last awhile.  Plus I love the special top they have.  Not nearly as bulky when putting shoes on.  I am buying more today.  Definitely recommend.  : )  Used to buy Gold Toe but their quality has definitely declined.  No elasticity.
B00D79RP9K|2|I didn't realize until I wore it once that it was sewn crooked. So now I can't wear it out. Lame.
B00OXH45FC|2|I'm usually a m/l. I orderd a medium and it looked like a xl.
B0021LA038|3|This clothing when arrived doesn't seen like what they publish in the internet.But overall it is still wearable.
B00GMSZT82|5|My best friend is a Halloween and Nightmare FIEND. Got these as a gift for him and he LOVES them! Very comfortable, fit great, the stripes make it all the better for a true Nightmare fan. Expensive, but worth it to make him so happy!
B00JAN4I1A|5|I am very happy with this T-Shirt. It fits exactly like I would expect of an X-Large. And, today is D-Day, so I'm wearing it at work!
B00E1PYA10|4|It's hot pink though, not soft pink. It stands about a full foot from the top of your head, and if you happen to have a big head, it's very tight. This was used for a stage production and different performers had harder times with its size.
B00EOIDPYC|5|Excellent
B003YLRKBO|4|I absolutely love the way these feel on me. Great tights.
B00IFCV52M|4|Both dresses are perfect for this summer!
B00XCVDYJ8|2|I recieved 12 of the exact same print. Red and white with polka dots. Also they are NOT string on the side and back as pictured but thick on the side and back. Nothing like the photos. The material is ok but I definitely can't wear ANY of them with shorts that are at all light colored. Bummer.
B00IJHJ06G|4|good for the price, I wish it had a little bit of cotton.
B00CBFXO1Y|5|I love wearing socks to bed and these are just the right weight...not too thin and not too thick. Very pleased.
B009FV9NQM|5|Excellent. Thank you.
B00JAE3E1Y|5|I bought this for my four year-old daughter in a size 5/6 and it fits perfectly.  The sleeves are a little long, and there is some room to grow, which is exactly what I was looking for, so she'll get some long term wear out of this coat.<br /><br />It's extremely well-made.  The brushed wool on the outside is super soft, but still wool-so extremely warm, and the lining is smooth, so the coat isn't at all itchy.  It's lightweight enough to where I can dress my daughter in this, know that the wool will keep her warm, but that it's not so bulky that she struggles to get comfortable in her car seat (unlike some of her puffy warm coats).<br /><br />We ordered this in the Tommy Plaid and the colors are gorgeous and go with a lot of different outfits-it really dresses up an ensemble, my daughter loves the coat.  It's very cute and super classy, and you can't beat the price.  I absolutely recommend this coat!
B00G4X2W58|3|I like the look and feel but a bit tight in the waist.
B00MF1CLFY|3|It's a nice vest but I ordered a size larger for a little extra room.  I didn't get it.
B007GCO6D2|4|As a tall woman I have found it very difficult to find scrub pants that are long enough for me, and I was even a little skeptical of whether these would be too. However once they arrived I was absolutely amazed and thrilled - they fit a little longer than I'd expected!<br /><br />They fit perfectly, they have tons of pockets, and I get LOTS of compliments on them at work!<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that the drawstring at the waist is a little thin, and cuts in when I have it done up tight. But I only have to do that when my pockets are overloaded to avoid them falling down!<br /><br />I have two pairs of these pants, and I will be ordering more of them shortly. I thoroughly recommend them to anyone with long legs who struggles with finding long enough scrubs - I hope you'll be surprised by these as I was!
B005GYGEXM|1|Very see through and cheap material
B008OY1H7E|3|I really wanted this to fit - so I got a M, then had to return it for a L. The large fit, but it was really uncomfortable to walk in. I am usually an 8, I have hips and a tiny waist. Believe me this didn't stretch much. The corset though was a bit on the thick side - so it added inches all around that I was not comfortable with. For the price it should fit better _ in my opinion.
B001286MK6|5|I love these things; the fit and quality are great. The low-rise look good (even on my body); they don't look like grampa's briefs. The materials are high quality and hold up to many washes. Soft and comfortable. My favorite underwear.
B0006FKF5O|1|I wish I would have known these jeans were fake!!!!!!!!!  The company was very deceptive.  They should let customers know that their products are not authentic!!!!
B00BI0QUL4|1|Bad
B00AMKMHW2|5|The product fits ok if you are going to order choose the next largest size
B00VE5FIEI|4|Very cute and will wear even thought it's a little tight.
B00QO2PKM6|4|Dad loves it. Gets lots of compliment on the catchy picture and phrase.
B002SFJFS8|3|Colors do not look as vibrant in real life as they do in the photographs. Still a nice tie but it did not meet my expectations
B00CAWGGH2|5|Delivered days before estimated. Seems to be good quality for the cost.
B00ECIYWPA|1|I don't know if its supposed to fit any bigger. Than it does right now that would be defeating the purpose.  It rolls up my lower back and hurts really bad I have to send it back.
B005YV0Z6E|5|Fits to my size I wear and makes u look sexy! Very comfortable fabric and the price was awesome! Loved how I looked in it.
B00C0CNF9E|1|I got these for my wife, they are a nice thickness, and look nice. We however are totally unsatisfied with them. We found a issue right away with one of the thumbs which was sewn shut and the other was not. It was odd but as soon as she put them on we realized one wasn't supposed to be shut. Her thumb went up and about 1/3 fit in the thumb spot meaning there was a huge space inside the glove between her index finger and thumb. We tried to open the closed thumb.... fail! It frayed and left one thumb looking terrible. Second issue, if the first didn't give us a clue about the quality, was that after wearing them for ONE DAY the tread attaching the owl flap to the top of the gloves started loosening and eventually the stitching stared coming out.<br /><br />WASTE OF MONEY!
B00829P6IC|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this top! I've fallen in love with this whole collection. This is my first shirt I've bought from Patty but it will not be my last! This top is sexy and sleek and so perfect. The material is soft and stretchy and hugs in all the right places. I'm 5'5\\", 134 lbs, 34DD chest and I got a size small, its fits perfectly. Its stretchy so you can go a little small if you like a tighter fit (like I do), but a medium would probably fit just fine.
B00IYN4DDA|2|Fabric 5 stars, quality 3 stars,  black cardigan was zigzag surged only. fit is an American juniors XL, I ordered size 16-18 fits in arms but only comes to side of breast and hugs in underarm curve. My size : misses large, bra 38D 5'9&#34; this hits just below my rib cage sits high natural waist. In same order, I also purchased the short sleeve red cardigan shipped to same address was charged double shipping over $12 so yes, that stung!
B007I7XPEQ|4|The briefs are fine but did find them to be cut a little smaller than their nylon briefs which I prefer but Amazon did not have them and shopping where I live is difficult.  I would buy them again if I can't get to a city that has a jockey outlet or a department store.
B003YI8ZPW|5|I love my new hat. I wear it more than any of my other hats I own. I'm so glad I purchased it. I will buy another soon. Thanks Amazon.
B00E87WJ9Q|5|My daughter loved this. Very stylish
B00HR0Q0H8|4|Nice, but too short for my tall son.  Well made.
B00KNVHG2Q|5|It's a wonderful dress but I would suggest getting a petticoat to go under it to flair it out  but it fits great just follow the measurements : 3
B00IW8UGJW|4|Fits properly and hasn't  shrunk in the dryer.
B00EWASH9A|3|It was very cute and what i had expected the issue was that the size i had bought did not fit properly from the top but it was the size i usually buy
B00IS6CC4A|2|This jacket lacks quality.
B00DPKFDLS|1|I was disappointed with the wig. I searched for one with the cut I wanted, but the one I received was very different than shown in the photo.
B00YOLE5LQ|5|This is the softest T-shirt that I have ever put on my body. It is so cute, and I love it. The length is perfect for me at 5' 8&#34; as a cover up. It will be awesome for our beach vacation in a couple of weeks. I can't wait to wear it. I highly recommend this T-shirt to all ladies !!
B00EODVD46|5|I love these. they look great in my little girls hair and love the fact that they are interchangeable so you get more colors to mix up!!
B005FY0BBE|4|So I work at a retail store and they asked someone to be a voulunteer to be a clown for the kids on a Saturday. Prime eligible shipping got it to me quickly and the kids loved it. Everyone was surprised by how good the costume I got together was. Thing is you do need to saftey pin the blue part around your neck in the back or it's too loose. the rest of the costume breathes and feels nice. shoes and wig and facepaint or gloves are not included. just the pants and shirt and neck piece. roomy enough to wear my basketball shorts underneath and a T-shirt as well. recommend you buy facepaint, gloves, wig and clown shoes separately. One other thing. At one point either a kid or a corner caught the back of my shirt and it started ripping a little in the bag like a pair of panty hose. So it's not very durable but it's still worth the money. Just get it if you need to wear it once or two or three times.
B004M17L9G|1|Tight on the waist, large on the hips. These pants are a bad fit and do not look good on. I would not recommend them pants and believe the actual fit is not true to the description or reviews I read before buying.
B00LOV7MPK|5|I ❤️💛💚💙💜 it
B009E31GX4|5|the shirt fits perfect and the material is awesome, the price of the shirt is even better ! deff recommend to anyone looking to buy one & i will deff be ordering more colors
B009S0S4BK|1|These are awful. They slide down into your shoe halfway and are constantly needing pulled back out
B00MHGI3EU|1|H-U-G-E and weirdly cut.  I'm a small framed but fit guy and got the small.  The shoulders appear to be cut for a linebacker (though the lower part of the sleeve was tight?), and the sleeves literally went 6&#34; past my hand. If you're a large guy, it might work out for you, the workmanship, lining and material seemed to be of decent quality.
B008FPMWW6|2|Well this is much trashier looking than it seemed online. I just wanted something under certain tanks but the glitter in this is scratchy and cheap. Like something you'd buy at Claire's when you're 13.
B00BMW2C1U|5|Look much better than what they cost. Perfect opera length. Shiny satin material, but not tight like second skin. The only issue is a somewhat long pinky but minor.
B00I9AND7U|3|This runs very small. Very cool jacket, though. Looks just like what the team wears and is made very well.
B00W4YMVM0|5|Fits perfect and is adorable!
B00NBQ6LIK|5|I bought this as a gift for my friend. It has a very high quality leather. And the design looks very cool.
B000IEUXT6|5|the color was just what I was looking for and the size and fit were just right
B000TSFWTC|1|I hand washed it once and the seam tore on third time I wore it and then the wire popped out the front of bra.
B00RTFUK8Q|4|I'm a size 6 in shorts but because I read all the other reviews I ordered XL and boy am I glad I did! Fits perfect.
B0089B8Y50|5|Such a comfortable fit, if I could love in these my whole pregnancy I would!
B008RPMRBK|5|It was beautiful.  Arrived fast used it in my wedding!  Now I am trying to sell it!
B00EPMBGXE|5|loved the shirt, but a little big.
B00EE19OMG|5|I am 30 years old, 5'5'' 140 lb. and bought a size 9.  It's soooooo comfortable, not too showy, sits just right.
B00F23XCK0|5|I really love this cap more than any of the others because it is lightweight and has only one seam.
B00TBHM35S|1|My shirt came with a hole in the side seam I had to fix before I could wear it.
B00GTEOYIK|2|The sweater runs small and is not.long enough!
B00UBTRPIU|5|Dress arrived MUCH sooner than expected! I love it. I will order a petticoat  for fullness  but it is still lovely without  it. Great quality!!
B00KX0AECG|5|Perfect!
B001ELL6PW|5|Excellent brand. I have never been but satisfied with Glamorise Front-Hook Bras. The only STRONG suggestion I would like to make : please, please, diversify the colors!! Black, red and white is such a yesterday's out-dated range of colors! Where are the purple, the green, the royal blue, the chocolate brown, the caramel, to name only a few? I have been buying Glamorise for over 10 years now and the ONLY selection I get are those 3 colors.
B00M70EGX8|5|This is a ladies top that gives your body regular shape and makes you look more attractive. Putting it on makes you feel confident and joyful. I have been using it for a month now and have found it an excellent and comfortable wear.
B005LAM354|5|ive been a disturbed fan for years now i can show off the awesome gloves with pride . very good
B00FLOB7X4|1|I receive the goods is melody
B008FWJTF2|5|My 29 year old likes these socks and says they are quite comfortable. When asked if the wild stripes are okay, he says that he actually wears them with a suit when going to a &#34;fun&#34; type event.
B00GGPB804|5|Loooove it! This turned out  be much better than expected. I thought the color was going to be dull due to the pictures that were shown of each color but it's actually very vibrant and perfect. It's very very light and comfortable as well. I'm so happy I purchased this product and indefinitely recommend it to everyone.
B00F9NP3N2|5|Fits well, I'm a size 12-14 UK/NZ sizing frame with an E cup and this top looks stunning on, the XXXL works perfectly. It fits perfectly now with laces as they were when it arrived (completely pulled in), but I reckon if I had the XXL and loosened the laces that would still fit well (therefore someone 12-14 with curves could probably get away with a XXL if they loosen the laces a bit). I'm going to order the XXL to find out.  I'm 171CM tall and the length of the arm straps was a bit long for me but it is not noticeable with a shirt underneath, I'm sure it would be easily adjusted.  I'm pleased with it and the fabric is exactly how it looks in the pictures.
B00FG0N9OI|1|I don't know what on God's great earth happened with this. I ordered a Large according to the given dimensions (but I would normally take a small or medium). It looked so cute in the picture and I've been wanting a one-piece like this, but was far too small. I couldn't even get it over my shoulders. Very disappointed :(
B00A7FR0F6|5|Love the color and the item is not as cheaply made as the little blue checkbook covers that tend to crack at the spine.
B001ODUB2E|4|I can't say anything about the sizing on this costume because some parts are too big like the bust and I thought I would have plenty to fill that part up!!! On another note the shoulders don't fit on me like they do in the pics but I have wide shoulders so.... The back is also another issue. The only thing keeping it closed are 4 round velcro tabs so parts of your back might show. I must tell you the truth though I bought this costume because of the price and plan to break out the glitter gun, bedazzler, and the old thread and needle to put some of my flair in it. But all in all very nice for the price I paid so I am very happy with this costume and can fix the rest easily! Hope this helps!
B00F15UJZK|3|Cute tutu. Good quality for the price. Good for photos.
B00OGQDTWA|5|Nice shirt. Shrinks moderately with warm wash and dry for a trim fit. If unsure of size it would be better to order up a size rather than down.
B000M55BEI|5|Awesome!
B001D50GU0|5|Christmas gift for my step father and he loves them!  Very warm and durable.
B00MHRJ5KK|5|All of the RG shirts I have purchased have been vibrant, well made, and gotten me plenty of comments.  The &#34;tailored&#34; RG shirts fit me best, but I'm probably between XL and XXL.  I order XXL for RG shirts, especially tailored.  I'm not a body builder, but have a thick chest and arms.  I wear a size 48 coat.<br /><br />If you can size the shirts correctly, you'll love this brand.  Please note the difference between tailored fit and standard fit.  Also note that the shirts made in China seem to run a tad larger than those made in India.  At least that's my impression.
B006MRNK7K|3|I liked the costume but when I received it the bag was open and it looked like it was a returned item.  The eye mask was also missing from the costume, so that was disappointing too.
B000Z9BMAS|4|Usually these fit great but this batch seems looser in the waist and tighter in the thigh than normal. Still, they fit well enough that I would buy them again.
B00CV9F7DI|3|The problem is not the size; I ordered a &#34;small&#34; and expected one.  Rather, the problem is the placement of the emblem/insignia.  It is so far over that it is almost at the armpit!  Really makes it look strange.
B008SB25YM|4|fits great, well made
B00MO72QV8|4|Metal wallet is nice size. The slots could be slightly bigger for business and Dr appointment cards. I don't carry a purse so this is great for ID theft protection.
B00GSW6LG6|4|Nice though.
B00DF0T0OY|5|This is a great product...it is warm, soft and simply perfect for my 16 month old...I particularly loved the product's softness...
B00II9D7WI|5|These are perfect for chilly days when standard leggings just aren't enough. Also great for wearing under pants on cold days. Love em!
B00NKDCH3W|5|I am OBSESSED with Ouija Boards so I fell in love with this shirt the moment I saw it. It was EVERYTHING I expected it to be. Fits perfectly. I've also been complimented on it numerous times by customers at my work. I will ABSOLUTELY be placing another order soon.
B00QB2GW5I|5|Okay it's a hockey jersey....with the Slayer logo! Best combination ever!  Besides the amazingly obvious, it fit just like a regular guys jersey. Well constructed and the logo is embroidered.  I saw a guy wearing this jersey at the outdoor Stadium Series and HAD to have it, ordered it right there at the game from my phone.  Arrived faster than Zdeno Chara's slapshot!
B009LR0DKU|4|It's very nice and I look great in it.  I'm actually getting the blue color.  it is so lovely and fit nicely.
B00YGMRQUU|5|Loved this dress. Bought another from Macys for more than $300, sent it back in favor of this dress.
B000RZI82K|4|Purchased this for my husband who is a large-statured man. He looked great and everything fit well. No issues with quality or appearance except the hat. It looked pretty stupid and I couldn't get it to lay decent. Over all a good product.
B007XCT6QC|5|Bought this as a christmas present for someone and they loved it.  I love it as well, I wanted to keep it for myself!
B001BXVSWE|1|Both the product image and description are entirely false. The image is of a far superior product. This is fraud.
B00AEMWSM2|5|I am pleased with my purchase of the Famous Stars and Straps Men's Crossed Out Jacket. The quality, fit and style of the jacket are excellent and it was shipped and delivered with timeliness and efficiency.
B00BRBS1PC|5|my junior love this, and thanks
B001MYEJ8W|5|Very good gloves, it covered all winter time, i like it.
B00TYO9UZ4|4|good job.
B009V430L2|5|Great Shirt for a Round of Golf, or to wear to the office with a sport coat.
B00HF18JSW|4|I really like the fit of this bra.  It is very pretty and I also love that it comes in small sizes.  This was recommended to me by many on the Reddit thread - A Bra That Fits.  It is comfortable and provides the support I need.  It is a great cut for shallow (not projected), full on bottom breasts.
B00JBMNSK2|3|I will start by saying this is a super cute nightgown. The colors are very vibrant and any little girl who loves the Lego Movie will love this nightgown.  For the price though? I probably would not purchase again. It is a very thin and cheap material. It reminds me of pajamas you get at Walmart. Not there is anything wrong with Walmart pajamas, just not at this price point.
B00JKPWFOU|1|I am a plus size gal and this did not work for me.  It is not wide enough to cover my breasts.
B008253LNI|3|I bought these for Halloween,<br />I didn't really like them<br />I think you really have to have chicken legs to even keep them up where they should be.<br />Or a garter belt.<br />I don't think Ill be doing this again.
B00EOAYHVK|5|Great fit
B006W6KEE8|5|Sexy and slimming! Great dress and a deal for the price! Delicate material but I love the abundance of lace!
B00A58XQZS|5|these are perfect jeans for me. wash great, look fine.
B002HWS43O|4|Love them! Keeps the ears nice and toasty warm!
B002YQU6KC|5|I love these extenders.  I've been able to make clothing last so much longer!  The only problems I have is remembering where I put them.  There are so many different choices and I think I've been able to find an extender for everything I've tried so far.
B00BPFKQ8A|3|The concept of this dress is great. I even have the same body type as the picture but honestly the dress just fits too awkwardly and doesn't compliment your body very well. I ended up feeling like I was wearing a potato sack. It is nice material though.
B00416CAR0|5|I've been wearing these socks for around 4 months now and they hold up great, are comfortable, and look good.
B005V07DPO|5|My first rash guard.  It's comfortable and fits great. A great buy for the price and kept me from getting sunburned during a week of snorkeling in the Carribbean.
B00DRHEZWW|5|bien
B00M3MQVGK|5|This is a great layering tank, especially in the Winter when it is cold!  I love that it does not have a shelf bra inside.  I just wear my regular bra, and I don't have the extra elastic of the shelf bra to bother me.  I really like this.  I've ordered 4 other ones in different colors.  By the way, it seems the color choices are endless!  Maybe I'll buy more!
B00IMMTN88|5|super cute - my daughter loves having her own umbrella - perfect size
B00S5DF5PE|1|This dress was a bit large from the waist area. It was also not a nice purple color like in the picture it was more of a pink color. Material of dress was like spandex and didn't look flattering. Save your money.
B00OLCYVA8|5|My son's favorite Marvel Hero and he wears it all the time. Color and fit is still good after lots of washing and wear.
B00VXU45FC|4|Can't wait to wear this out. Fits great and color was exactly as expected which doesnt always happen with overseas amazon purchases. I might need to pick up a few more of these.
B00C7TK95S|5|Comfy hoodie!  I received an orange one as a gift and so I got this one as a gift for a friend.  I plan to order another as part of a graduation gift.
B007UTJ1I6|5|just wish it was a tighter fit
B00550PUNC|5|I really like this bra!  It is very comfortable and seems true to size.  I will buy more in other colors.  For those who have mentioned that the band rolled or that it gave a uni-boob look, try it in a larger cup if you are inclined to buy it again.  I don't really have that problem but I can see how buying it in a cup size that is too small may give that affect.  I find it to be just fine under casual clothes or work close.  I can't wait to buy it in black!
B00J04FRDW|4|I bought this for my 6 year old grandson and had to reorder it in sz 8. He usually wears a 5. Once I got the correct size, he loved it!
B001F0PVLC|1|This garment is poorly designed and extremely uncomfortable.  Don't buy it.  I ordered a large because I normally wear a large size.  I also followed the sizing chart given by the mgf. on Amazon.  I'm 6'0\\".  The large was huge!  I sent it back and ordered a medium.  But even the medium is still too big.  I'm sending this one back, too.  The garment is very long. It goes past my mid-thighs!  The front zipper starts at the very bottom of the coat and because the coat is so long (past mid-thighs) you have to bend down to grab the zipper to start to zipper it.  It is not an easy garment to zip both because of the where the zipper starts and because it also has a reverse zipper that is difficult to engage and must be engaged before zipping upward.    As a result, when you do manage to get the coat zipped and because the zipper starts at mid-thigh, the bottom of the coat is wrapped tight around your legs.  You can't sit down down with the coat fully zipped! (Maybe you could if your a women who's use to wearing tight mini-skirts!)  It's impossible to go into your pants pockets with the coat fully zipped so low around your thighs.    I know, I know, I know what your saying.  Your saying that the coat specifically has a reverse zipper that your supposed to un-zip when you want to sit down or go into your pants' pockets.  But maybe you don't want to unzip yourself everytime you want to sit down or go into your pants' pockets!!!  Maybe you want to keep the coat closed when sitting down or go into your pants' pockets!  Maybe you feel like a jerk reaching down to unzip yourself in front of everyone on a crowded subway!!!  I can not understand how the manufacturer of this coat produced it and put its brand name on it without producing prototypes and then having models try to zip it and unzip it and also try to sit down or go into their pants' pockets when this garment is zipped.  The coat has the label of Claiborne.  Whoever is doing the designing, manufacturing and marketing forClaiborne should be fired.  This garment is useless.  Don't buy it unless you are at least eight feet tall.
B00MO9GDFG|5|Bought for my daughter for Christmas....received on time and exactly what I wanted!
B009DJCJLC|5|These are exactly what you'd imagine: sports bras. They're comfy and a great price.
B00C8FLPPO|5|My mother-in-law has a major illness and had ask for a bathrobe for Christmas. She needed something large with a certain length. This task wasn't as easy as it sounded considering her size and illness. After a lengthy search we came across this product and she absolutely loves it. She said that it has been perfect for her.
B0057IXTU8|5|For my kids during summer camp. They loved them counselors asked my kids where they too could buy them.
B00A17K54I|5|perfect
B0030A7230|4|Awesome!!!! Very Very Nice!!
B005KSKPQG|5|These leggings are great.  They do have a slight chemical smell when you first open them but thats to be expected considering what they're made from.  The fleece lining is thin but I also expected this; if it were any thicker it would cause lumps and creases. . .not cute!  I ordered a black and brown pair and they shipped and arrived quickly and in great shape.  I am 5'3\\" about 115 lbs and they fit a tad big; but, I have absolutely no complaints considering the price for this product would be doubled or tripled anywhere else.  I would highly recommend these leggings if you're looking for something comfortable.  If you're looking for super high quality fashion leggings, look elsewhere, but be prepared to pay much more.
B007TYS30E|3|Shrunk by a size after washed and dried.
B0098KC54W|5|Awesome quality, great fit, and it came exactly in the time expected. Highly suggested.
B00C0PFS96|3|it worked
B00E2QYEFK|5|This fit perfectly on the top the bottom is a little tight but that's ok it's not very revealing it fits like a dreAm I'm 5&#34;3 and my size Medium
B0066C71KI|5|I ordered these because my other pair of yoga pants were kind of old and I was just browsing on amazon and fount these for a good price. They arrived very quickly and fit me perfectly. I'll definitely be getting more!
B00DULB6BS|5|Using it for school and it has so much room for all my stuff!! I love Roxy stuff and this is good quality.
B00SCD4YHW|4|Nice shirt ran a lottle big though but still very nice
B0012UYPTY|1|The picture makes this bra look like a sexy sporty bra but it looks nothing like the photo, I think this model just has good boobs and makes it look good.It is just a piece of material that bunches all around the boobs, it looks funny under shirts and stuff. I don't ever see myself wearing this bra because every time I put it on to wear I just put it back because it looks funny.
B00AOJHHFS|5|Loved the shirt. Will recommend as a great buy.fix will, looks great. And very cool. I would buy again. Thanks.
B00RE4BZHC|5|I love this skirt...the fit...the design...wonderful!
B00AJUXIUK|5|The blazer: excellent quality - perfect fit & superb service!<br />Thank you for your efforts to ensure all my expectations were met! Your request for<br />more details on my size measurements made a real difference in getting the exact<br />right fit.
B00EFCBNAK|5|I have been looking for a simple royal blue<br />comfortable T-Shirt at a reasonable price.<br />This totally met my criteria.  I need to get<br />some more!
B00GXD8G0Y|2|Too loose around calf, too short for my liking. I prefer dress socks either at or above the calf.
B006M5APZ2|4|Fits well (:
B000FGX6IC|5|Product as described. Love it....
B00422M6JK|5|love them '
B009F7OSAW|5|my boyfriend love this, we bought it for him for christmas and its great. its the prefect size and definitely a great purchase
B00DH1ZK3G|5|nice quality suit, comfortable but buy your true size, bought larger size thinking it would fit small, but  was way too big on me personally
B00PZ9PQDC|5|He loves it!
B00NTWCX1K|5|Gracias
B0027E2474|5|Nice-looking, especially considering cost
B00HYZMMA0|5|exelente
B0002TP1D0|5|If you have problems with foot and ankle swelling you know regular sized socks become tight and painful at the end of the day.  This larger size is much more comfortable.
B00HUS7D3C|2|Doesn't fit like the F of the L panties I buy at Target. Rides up the behind.
B00IKBWOYQ|1|It did not go over your chest like it does in picture also its very hard to figure out how it goes on did not fit as expected
B00JM2FBII|4|Nice shirt for the price, very pleased but I could do without the sleeve straps.
B005IEWDTE|1|This was listed as a size 3X, it barely fit my grand-niece who wears an adult sm/med. Fail!!! Super FAIL!!
B00HVPPJ9O|5|I find the product to be well make. I like the looks. The product was somewhat large because I ordered it &#34;somewhat large&#34;. I read the reviews and it was said that the jackets ran somewhat small, so I  bought it some what larger than my size, and that's what I got. I don,t mind the largeness though,they are  great jackets. I bought two and I intend to keep them both.
B0056IUM9A|5|I was extremely pleased when this dress arrived.  I had ordered a different dress a few weeks prior and thought it looked cheap and flimsy.  This one looks expensive, beautiful, and classy.  It is nice quality, made of thick material, with lovely details.  My only complaint is that the little bow near the bodice was a little loose so I'll have to put a stitch or two in it to secure.  Otherwise, this dress was a great buy!
B00MJ7O82S|5|Great.  Fits perfectly and price is very good
B00GN73KB0|5|This shirt is great. It's loose but comfortable. It took a little bit to get here but it's worth it. It's soft and didn't shrink in the dryer. I highly recommend it.
B00KHI4MPO|5|great for work, very comfortable, easy to wear.
B000H9JZA0|3|lovely design..but the fabric was thin and rather stiff...hope it doesnt shrink when i wash it because it all ready looks small for a size medium...thought it would be better quality for a tee that cost 18 dollars...will not purchase any more shirts from this dealer even though they have some interesting designs
B0072H5QIU|1|Beyond tiny would fit a 8 year old and I am a slim girl no length at all and very snug the length is my only problem
B00IQG8AFW|5|I loved the swimsuit. it fits great on the body.
B00N6MSAXS|3|I really like the look of the shirt but I have thick arms and it was too small for them.
B00FZ9UBAA|1|The scarf has several giant pulls in it.  Extremely disappointed with this product.  Too late to return for christmas
B00NC3WFN2|1|I'm a women's size 6 and this was way too small, the sleeves were about 3 inches too short and it's not a sweatshirt like this picture indicates. Thank goodness the shipping was free and I had enough time to rush order another item, otherwise my ugly Christmas sweater party would have been a fluke.
B00H7JAX0E|3|Not as navy blue as I would expect.  Basically a dark blue but to me a navy is much deeper and darker.  I'm sure to find something to wear it with.
B0016C0C1S|4|Love these shirts. I believe I have bought four already. I wear them as uniforms to go to work. I love the french cuff sleeves. The reason why I gave it four stars is because there is alot of ironing involved and I hate ironing, but maybe my iron is not very good. Great shirt and color.
B00CAI8AJI|3|The shirt is a nice fit and for the very few times I actually need to wear a plain white shirt it will fit the bill, but it is NOT 100% cotton. The description just lists it as &#34;cotton&#34; which is a majority of its construction. Buyer be forewarned.
B00K9YS5P4|2|When I purchased this dress it said Grey in the title as the color, however, it looks like they have now removed that from the description because the dress is definitely not grey, it is purple.  If you're looking for a dusty purple dress, this could be the one for you, however, if you're looking for for grey, it is definitely not!  They did make it to my dimensions which was nice but then they blamed me for the color and said they were different on different monitors...which I get, but don't advertise it as grey if it isn't.
B000UZT7E0|2|Short in length as other viewer indicated.
B0017QA98E|5|I couldn't wait for Halloween for my daughter to be this happy to be Dorothy.  This dress is very well made and fits her perfectly with room to grow (2 years old, 30 pounds, on the tall side).  I like that it's relatively long so she has another year or two use, assuming it stays clean ...
B0024YVG5S|5|Awesome wallet.  I've never liked carrying a bulky wallet, which usually ends up in my back pocket, the most uncomfortable place to keep a wallet.  This wallet provides plenty of space for a couple of credit cards, ID, a couple of misc. cards, and some cash; and still remains small enough to be kept in my front pocket.<br /><br />The quality of construction is superb.  The leather is thick, the stitching is solid, and the slots and pockets are cut well.  I appreciate that the product is designed to last, and that they purposefully built it avoiding things that can deteriorate like a plastic window over the ID.  I am confident that this wallet will last me an extremely long time.  I purchased the tobacco finish.  It has a very attractive rugged look to it, and has developed a nice character with some minor scuffs from living in my pocket for the last several months.<br /><br />The wallet came a bit tight and the first few weeks it was a bit hard to get my ID out of the ID slot, but since then it has loosened up and has the perfect balance of retention and ease of sliding out.  There is a break in period with this wallet.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this wallet to anybody looking for a well made and highly functional alternative to the classic bulky wallet.  Sure it is a bit expensive, but the value is there in the quality of this product.  I pull this thing out with pride every time I have to pay, and have gotten several compliments on it.  I wouldn't be surprised if it gets passed on to a younger family member once I'm done with it.
B00NG7IOBQ|5|All is good!
B00PT1K99W|5|It's an awesome shirt but I clicked on Child Large and received an adult large! I couldn't find my original order receipt so I can't return it so my son is just wearing it to bed!
B0089XEK1A|4|Great marks for comfort, fit. Just not what I usually expect for \\"pink.\\" The color called pink is closer to suntan or toffee.
B0002BKUCU|4|I've owned and practiced nearly daily on a larger version of this mat for about 7 years.  The logo printing is long gone, but I think it provides a pleasing compromise between lush padding and dense support.  Three traditional \\"sticky\\" mats are not as cushioning, and thicker mats are too soft for support in standing poses (though for challenging balancing poses I've always chosen the floor).  This mat sticks to the floor, never shifting or bunching, and I use a towel-like (yoga toes) mat on top for hot/sweaty work -- not for additional stickiness, but for less ickiness!  I've finally dedicated a room at home for yoga and meditation, and want to have an at-home mat in addition to the one I keep in the trunk of my car for whenever I can catch a class.  The only reason I'm not purchasing this mat is because I'm still hoping to find the larger version -- several inches longer and a couple of inches wider.  Otherwise, I would have no qualms.  My experience with more eco-friendly mats has been that they sadly don't endure.  I believe I will be happily practicing on this mat 10 years from now.
B007UMEWMI|3|The dress looked very nice, but it fit way too small even though I have bought both from this company and this design before in the same size and never had a problem. But don't let that scare you off, because it is a lovely dress. Just beware the sizing.
B00DV2ZTZ0|4|I really like this blouse!  The embroidery (pretty) around hem started to unravel the first hour I had it on.  Am very disappointed.  I'm taking it to the dry cleaners to see if it can be stopped and/or repaired.  I wear size 14 and the 1X fit nicely.
B0051D9N5O|2|I have been a loyal Lee relaxed fit fan for years.  They have however changed the material to be more spandex and less twill and the fit is much smaller than previously.  I called Lee prior to purchasing these jeans and was told that this item number replaced the ones I had always purchased.  Unfortunately this is not the case.
B00EDNS9G2|5|Travelon Safe ID RFID Blocking Daisy Trifold Wallet with ID Window - Navy is really handy with lots of card slots.  I especially like the wider card slots for some cards I always carry.  The RFID protection give me some peace of mind about this aspect of ID theft.
B00FTZGJW4|3|Received the dress and tried it on only to noticed it was not a lace up back.  I would have kept it if it had a lace up back.
B000BQ53CS|4|I think this overall is a great little front pocket wallet.  The money clip doesn't hold single bills very well and doesn't expand to hold a ton of bills (~3-10 bills folded in half is the sweet spot) but if you don't carry a lot of cash, this wallet works fine.  I have 4 credit cards, 4 club cards (e.g. supermarket club cards, starbucks cards, etc.), 4-5 business cards and my drivers license stuffed into this thing and it handles them perfectly while keeping a slim profile.  Good quality of construction and materials.  Seems very durable.  A good buy!
B003OBBXA8|1|I bought this to be worn with many different colored tops - and was dismayed to find that the fabric was so thin and cheap that it was nearly translucent.  Everything worn under the shrug was completely visible.  The seams were raw and fraying, with exposed threads everywhere.  Incredibly poor quality product.  Do not purchase.
B00DNNVEN8|5|Sandals fit great.
B002A28VB6|5|I just purchased this robe and I love it! It is soft and absorbent, And the size s/m fits well. I would have preferred long sleeves and a more fun color, but this is perfect for now.
B00A6RESBE|5|Love the purse!!
B001VOH7P0|5|These scarves are soooo incredibly soft, and they look lovely. Not quite as much &#34;shine&#34; to them as seen in the pics, but I doubt you'll regret your purchase :)
B00ISXIFHG|5|love this item!
B005PFIRBE|5|I love it. The sizes were true to fit, and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. It's a good looking shirt.
B00DVFWRN4|5|Nice fit and a good weight, especially since ithas been so cool this year. Plain red socks are hard to find.
B00C4YWRYC|1|Really disappointed in this because you have to wear something under it. The sides are completely open and shows everything you have. I do not layering sweaters because it makes me hot. Wish the sides closed
B002R0FA2E|4|I'm giving this four stars because it is adorable and comfortable for my 3 1/2 year old but I did want to warn others that although it did fit, it was just barely big enough. I only want it for a one time thing to finish her butterfly outfit for Halloween. If I wanted it for her to wear more often I would've been quite disapointed. If you have a four year old or maybe even a pretty chunky three year old I would advise not getting the 2-4T.
B000JGD7W8|5|Purchased this in Red, size L, from Amazon, paired with the matching overcoat in Black.<br /><br />I'm extremely pleased with this nightgown.  Chose this as a reward for reaching a huge weight loss milestone, and am very glad I took the plunge.  The flowing skirt could look great on anyone, and is soft and lightweight.  The bodice's stretchy lace provides nice support and is very flattering compared to many other nightgowns, but if you're very large chested you might want more support than this can offer.  The fit is smooth and comfortable.  The matching overcoat makes for a beautiful pairing, and allows me to wear this around housemates as the gown's bodice is lace and might reveal more than you're comfortable wearing outside of the bedroom.<br /><br />I went to Shadowline's website to check the sizing, which seems to be more accurate for this product than the standard chart provided by Amazon.  For reference, I am 6', about 190, wear size 12, and ordered an L, which is perfect.  The gown falls to a couple inches above my ankle.
B00A0I9WBA|2|The whole feel and look of this shirt is cheap.. I ordered a M and it is tiny.. The buttons look SO cheap, if Im ever going to wear it they will have to be changed....disappointing!
B00EQGM3JK|5|This is a really cool, quality shirt. This shirt was a gift and my friend really liked it!
B00EUNWV0K|5|Very comfortable and cute.
B0028ZT8ZS|5|Exactly what I've been looking for!<br />Holds all my cards and cash and takes no space. Excellent.<br /><br />Maybe a bit pricey considering the materials etc, but whatever - this works great for me.
B007FGC6ZO|5|Adorable ruffle sleeves to a plain long sleeve shirt. Can't have too many long sleeve white shirts especially if our 2.5 year old insists on wearing short sleeves on any given day. Very cute. True to size.
B00HT3WY96|5|I originally bought some of these socks at Macey's and was so impressed with how soft and warm they were that when they finally wore out after a couple of years I thought I'd order some more this time from Amazon.<br /><br />I was a little worried that ordering them from a UK company would mean a long wait for delivery.  I need not have worried.  I ordered them on Oct 29 and they arrived today, Nov 6, only 8 days from order to delivery.<br /><br />Ah! The Joy of (Soft) Socks.
B00BCUPIAY|4|I wish they would go back to having 3 belt loops in the back.  The jeans would fit much better with a belt.  I don't think it can be too costly for the 2 extra ones.
B005GYGFZY|5|These pants fit true to size (for me anyway) and I love the fabric!  I will be buying more.  The delivery was also quick and the packaging competent.  Thanks to Spalding for a great exercise/dance pant that affordable!
B00P1G1GTW|5|Fits large but it didn't keep me from wearing it and showing my love!
B000NCNFPC|1|I ORDERED THIS PANTY FOR MY WIFE. WHEN WE GOT THE PAKAGE I WAS VERY DISAPONTED. I PERSONAL WOULD OF RETURNED IT. WHAT WE GOT WAS FRILLY, AND JUST NOT IT.MY WIFE HAS ONLY WORN IT ONCE. AND WITH ALL THE FRILL'S IT JUST NOT WHAT SHE WANTS TO WEAR UNDER ANY THING. IT'S EVEN HARD TO FIND THE OPEN CROTCH DUE TO THE FRILL'S. VERY DISAPONTED.
B00MGUN5G8|4|Very beautiful jacket<br />Great detail and soft materials<br />Fits a little snug but i will just purchase a bigger size i actually like the jacket that much
B009GNIW0W|4|The scarf is beautiful to look at and looks great on. Just be aware that it is a fashion item not meant to keep you warm. Another issue is that it's delicate meaning any little thing that snags it will just about ruin it. I wore it once and it must have brushed against either my earring or my purse strap and it's already got two pulls/snags in the fabric. You have to be careful with it, which kinda takes the joy of just wearing it. 4 stars for the look of it, 2 stars for the delicacy and quality of it.
B004IYIMTK|5|Love these. Made me a fan of this style again over the cotton boxer-briefs. Wish they had a smaller price tag, or I'd order more than just 2-3 pairs. But definitely recommend for style, comfort, and control.
B00PFM6APM|5|Exactly what I've been looking for in an over-sized sweater down to the pattern! This is absolutely my new favorite sweater. I love the color-block theme and the over-sized style. It's  very snug and stylish. It's  made out of heavy sturdy material but admitting it is very delicate and sometimes snags whenever I'm wearing bracelets. I got it in black/white and I am very happy with my purchase!
B0055QQAVC|5|The gift was just right.
B00372179Q|5|I'm a big guy (6'3\\", 290 lbs) who played football in college so I have always had a bulky build and prefer my clothes to be looser fitting, especially so I can layer underneath. I was looking for a good all purpose raincoat that I could wear when I'm doing recreational activities (boating, camping, tailgating, etc) as well as when I need a rain coat for when I'm in khakis and a golf shirt. However I did not want to spend a couple of hundred bucks on Gore-Tex. I read the reviews on this coat and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />It was put to the test this past week during my family vacation. First we were on a boat in the 1000 Islands region of St. Lawrence River in the US. Some heavy afternoon rain hit us on the bow rider so I donned my new coat and drove the boat home 15 min in a heavy rain and some spray from the waves. Other then a face full of water, I didn't notice water on my skin. While the outside of the jacket did seem to have some dampness, my skin and shirt underneath were dry. The other experience I had with the jacket was in Maine by the ocean. I was packing the car to head back home on the last morning in a torrential downpour. Once again, I was dry underneath.<br /><br />I like the roominess or the coat very much and my fianc&eacute; gave me several compliments on the stylish appearance. It's highly functional for a coat of this price and is nice looking. When i read reviews on here, i always try to take things with a grain of salt and measure the product on what its meant to do instead of holding a product to an unfair standard. If you need a stylish rain coat at a reasonable price that can handle the occasional wetstuff , then this is definitely your coat. If you spend most of your time in the wilderness, work outdoors or on a boat, or as a crew member on the Maid Of The Mist, then this is not the jacket for you and you are into an entirely different application. It's a great pick up for the price!
B007VEEMVQ|5|My daughter wears these with her school uniform.  She is notorious for ripping her stockings.  So far so good...  they have lasted her since she first wore them.
B00T5C8088|5|beautiful fabric, rather sheer fabric as mentioned by others, but this makes a very comfortable dress to lounge in
B00GA35LKU|4|Though the gown fits loose below the empire waist the actual bust area is too small for large breasted women
B00JTYPOS6|5|Fits well and will be a great summer dress for all occasions. Good for the busy toddler
B00062NHMA|4|I ordered M, which is what I usually wear with CK, and they were a bit too big. Apart from that. Excellent CK quality as always.<br /><br />These should also come assorted and not just three of a kind.
B0073E5718|4|We bought some black material and made a replacement cape because the cape was way too small. My friend used to be a security guard and loaned me his utility belt, although there was nothing wrong with the cloth one that came with the costume. The ears were not sewn on evenly, one was higher than the other (still need to fix that). It is comfortable to wear and I didn't overheat. It's a nice costume for the price. I'm 6'1&#34; and 230 lbs. and the XL had plenty of room for me, it was even a little loose.
B008R93OYA|4|The printed words are somehow smaller than I thought; and Royal Mail really sucks. I almost lost the package in Chinese mail system. Provide UPS please if possible, even if it costs more~
B00BCNXORU|5|Bought this as a birthday gift for my sister and she wears it all the time. It's very soft! Quality fabric that is true to size- it fit as expected. Very pleased with this purchase and I know it will last her a very long time. I would buy yours before it's gone! They took our favorite tv show off the air! :( These shirts will probably sell out now. Will purchase from this seller again!
B00M78ZI2I|5|Perfect and silky, I'm not sure why I posted &#34;a bit small,&#34; but it looks like I did. Synthetic fibers have finally made it to the twenty-first century. I hope this really gets some bamboo-growing regions some well-deserved money and that they don't clear indigenous acres to grow it.<br /><br />I will get more for sure! Can we have more colors (the blue is great but I had to ask.)
B001I8IT7E|5|me gusto el detalle bordado.excelente
B00E7KVG8E|5|Absolutely gorgeous, fit perfectly
B008FV0XJE|5|very nice. wife felt sexy not trashy. wore it under a dress to business dinner. she said very comfortable. she wants one in a different color also.
B007MU5K92|2|The waist is small and the thighs are big. Not for someone without curves. I will be returning.  Good quality, though.
B00QPYUF9Q|4|very pretty dress at a great price. Nice soft material and seems to be made well.
B00L2RY3W6|5|This is a beautiful dress that fits as expected. I wore it to an outdoor wedding and it was perfect. It would be appropriate for most occasions. The material is soft and smooth and the blend is moisture wicking. I was sweating quite a bit during the dancing, but it dried fairly quickly. I like that's it's stretchy as well so you won't have to worry about busting buttons or zippers if you eat something or dance to vigorously! You'll be pleased if you purchase this dress.
B00KVLUIUU|5|Beautiful dress
B004SUHKK6|4|These are cute and seem to work well, but keep in mind that they run large. My son normally wears a 5, but the 5s of these shoes were way too big and floppy on him and I was worried he'd trip, so I ordered 4s. I recommend ordering a size down from what your kid normally wears in sneakers.
B00KEUE9OY|3|Runs big
B00LAF0R52|4|as expected.
B00J9TMY3E|5|Hope dad likes it as much as I!
B00IXO28TG|5|This is an adorable set.  The quality is good.  Can't wait to see it on my grandson.
B007SH27G8|5|Just received my pair today and I'm so happy I read the reviews first. I ordered a large and I'm 5'4\\", 145 lbs. They fit like a glove, Great material and very flattering. I will certainly be ordering more in other colors!!
B0040230FG|5|the quality of the product is not the best but it looks very nice when is put on with a nice shirt
B002P2T7O6|4|I like the cut  as I have broader shoulders.
B00AOUIMD8|5|Discovered the Antidote brand when a coworker arrived at work wearing them. I ordered a set, love them and plan to order more. I am a traveling nurse and required to wear specific colors on different assignments...these will be my go to scrubs I can order online and not have to shop for. Shopping for scrubs can be a miserable job depending on where you are located.The pants are heavier material than typical scrubs and have multiple pockets which is a must for ER nurses. I would recommend them to nurses who appreciate good quality, nice looking and professional scrubs.
B004LUXXYU|5|Great shorts.
B00L57GMF4|5|My Grandson is very warm and cozy in his new p.j.s
B00E3V9KKI|1|I don't like that I had to order same size for top and bottom. Top was to small and bottoms to big...
B0043O56HQ|5|I am very happy with my order of Dickies pants. They are going to be perfect work pants. and the fit is fantastic! Thank you
B00KBZSRZ4|1|This is supposed to help protect me from the sun but it can't even protect my nipples from ambient light. You can see my milkduds straight through this shirt. If normal light renders this shirt transparent I'm sure the suns harmful rays have no problem getting through it either.
B00J07V8QO|5|It's gorgeous but my 10 month old can barely breath in the 18 months.  Will be getting 24 months and hopefully have better luck. Otherwise beautiful!
B00A6HM71W|2|The fabric isn't what it says it is. Its very cheap, and doesn't wash or wear well. I can sleep in them.
B00DGAKT5W|4|My wife can't keep her hands off me when I'm sporting this bad boy.  She can be absolutely furious with me, and one glance in the direction of my SOEBEAN Mens Low Rise Sexy Swimwear Boxer Brief Bikini, she's staring at me with her jaw on the floor.<br /><br />Product allows for just the right amount of wiggle to keep the ladies swingin!
B00DQYPF8O|4|Nice fit and great for travel.
B00KHRYXMW|1|Need to give length. Cost me $19.00 to alter leg length.
B00A9ZAHQS|5|I love Domo-kun. I needed a new wallet. As soon as I saw it, I had already purchased it. The wallet is fairly large, but not too much. It looks exactly like in the pictures. Good quality and has enough pockets for cards.
B003JCYQOC|5|I am 5'6&#34; and about 127 pounds. This costume fit perfectly and didn't feel cheap like most halloween costumes you order. It came with a few great accessories too! Great buy.
B00B9X4XQ4|3|Cute on but poorly made. Threads started coming apart in the first day.
B00A17K6UQ|5|I wear these everyday for work under all kinds of button up dress shirts. Material is soft and you barely know you have it on.  Good wicking performance and excellent breathability. They hold up very well too.
B00505OY2K|5|I think I have found myself another favorite shirt company.  After my purchases of an advice from a sand dune bookmark and an advice from a mountain sweatshirt, I thought &#34;Why not get one of their shirts too?&#34;.  I am so glad I did because I love anything to do with nature.  Now, on to reviewing the shirt itself.  I decided to get this particular &#34;advice from nature&#34; shirt because I really don't have any brown colored shirts in my collection (I have mostly blue, green, and red shirts).  I really love this particular dark brown (or &#34;dark chocolate&#34; as Your True Nature calls it) color.  Probably one of my favorite shades of brown.  In terms of the design itself, I think it's awesome.  Just like my other aforementioned advice from a mountain sweatshirt,  the way it is presented is just perfect.  The differing shades of yellow-orange text compliment the color of this shirt, as well as the hawk, perfectly.  Also, I love how there's little hawks between each of the pieces of advice on this here shirt.  Now, on the most important part of this shirt, the advice.  As expected, it is great advice everyone should follow.  While I love all of the advice, my most favorite piece of advice on this particular shirt is &#34;Swoop down on opportunities&#34;.  That alone is some advice that really relates to me right now.  I am still in the process of officially getting an internship for this summer, and needless to say, I need to &#34;swoop down&#34; on every opportunity I have towards an internship because in the end, it will definitely pay off.  If you, or anyone else loves hawks like I do, get this shirt!  Great design, and great advice for all!  This is just the start of my newfound love for this company, Your True Nature.  They do a great job of promoting the idea of all of us being one with nature and this and all their products definitely show it!  I will definitely be coming back for more!
B002FGUONA|4|I have a hard time getting a good fit for my size.  This bra provides good support.  My back no longer hurts.
B002LTJGNK|5|in m pictures, it looks washed out cuz of the lighting but it's a true red, like pictured. LOVE IT! a purple one i got from Private Island was almost black and got sent back...this one though, right on! will order another one for my bff :)
B00C656SA8|3|Not big enough. Needs to be big enough to put a mobile printer to and be able to lock it.
B00C1KAQWE|5|Great for summer!
B00MI79914|3|legs are quite skinny and tight
B00LHI841Q|3|Very thin.... But good comfortable fabric, and breathable.
B00UAC1BB0|3|Beautiful skirt. Too long. Drags on the ground. I'm 5''2&#34;.
B000OEI1K8|2|This is a really cute and well cut dress for the summer, however you must order at least three sizes up otherwise forget it.
B001ST3G62|5|Well I read the reviews and got a size bigger and I honestly wish I didn't. I got an XL and had to send it back. Large fits me like a glove, its supposed to be figure hugging. It has a great feel and fit and I modified the top red part to look more 40's like. I love it and I would suggest that if your thinking of getting it, you do.
B00L6CZZYC|5|Was a big hit...thanks
B00KHC9RLO|4|I wore it the first time on the second hooks .. I wish I ordered smaller one<br />I'm 5&#34;3' , 125 lbs and 26 inch waist
B00JU8VXYU|3|I am really disapointed it give to your behind a triangle shape
B0084HKB4Q|5|These have quickly become my favorite scrub pants! They fit well with room to move (which is very important as a veterinary nurse!)
B00IDHG3F8|5|Great quality, and very comfortable. A little baggy behind the knee but fit well overall.
B00MM3OEQ4|5|Daughter absolutely loves it! Runs a little big.
B008BRZ2ES|5|My husband has been wearing MY robe for some months now so I decided to get him his own after years of mentioning to him how great robes are. Somehow one day he decided to wear mine and he realized how great they are. When he got his he was so happy, I love to see him in his big fluffy blue robe. I have washed it and it has held up. My husband is 6' and 200lbs and it fits him perfect.
B00XQG5H8A|4|Nice wallet, however, had I known there is no clip that holds the money I would have not purchased this wallet. The wallet uses a strap to hold the money not secure. I've gone back to my old wallet until I can find a replacement.
B00HBG2N2Y|5|I love it , keep doing new designs so I can buy them
B00LFEM0EO|5|My wife loves my new coat. The color can be paired with most of her outfits. She's happy with her new coat.
B00J13DYO6|5|I love that there is finally a pretty plunge bra for a larger bust.  I had been wearing a different Elomi style and had to go up a cup size in this version.  Bonus there is a clip on the bra that can be worn with racer back tanks or dresses!
B00J4I3PNI|5|This dress is adorable. My 1 month old wore it to a wedding and it was so pretty.
B00D4J0CNO|5|It was a gift and she loves it.
B00LBGLBOQ|5|Love this dress!  The thick fabric and detail at the top makes the dress look expensive and high-end.  I got a million compliments when I wore it. It's a great dress for almost any occasion.
B00IYF2X4E|5|Great pair of shorts. Very comfortable.
B000VTDEJO|5|the shield is not straight(slight slant to one side),however the recipient LOVED IT!said that it was a great fitting t-shirt!looks AWESOME(the celtic design).very happy with purchase!
B00FIK4UBC|3|Gift
B0018P1WOO|5|Comfortable fit- will order again
B00EFVHP5I|5|Fits perfectly. Looks great.
B00LKW2RNK|1|Can't even give it a star at all!!  One arm hole was a size xsmall and the other was a xxlarge! Not even fixable!!! China crap from wish. com!! Waste of money!!!!! I can't believe they made me give a star! Wasn't worthy of a single star!!
B00BPFLQ84|5|Love love love this dress.  I was worried it wouldn't be flattering on my love handles and held off on buying it for a long time.  But I'm so glad I finally gave it a chance, it is so sexy on!
B009B9G2MQ|5|A very nice comfortable uniform top. Well made and comfortable. I would buyvit again. It is very reasonable in price as well.
B002GJMP0Q|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. The perfect size for all my toiletries. It has a flat bottom which makes it sit nice and square on a counter or shelf, the opening stays open so can can put things in or take them out easily. And I like that it comes in so many different designs. The price is ok too.
B00JBXXEUK|4|Perfect fit
B00IY0F6ZC|5|I just received this jumpsuit and it is a lot better than I expected!  The quality of the material is excellent and the fit - super !  I am very very happy with this item.
B0037NYG0C|5|These fit a little snug, compared to other brands of pants and jeans - I thought ordering a 5 would give my normally size 4 kiddo some growing room...  they *just* fit - but he will outgrow them before those knees rip out, unlike other pants.<br />My rough and tumble farm boy loves these, and I love that they are holding up with no rips or holey knees!  Most jeans last a week, maybe two before knees are torn - these have held up two months and still going strong.<br />Boys love that they have pants like Daddy, and I love that amazon's price beats the farm store's!
B000NWWNT6|2|Purchased this hat and it looks great, unfortunately it does not fit.  The tag inside the hat says 'Size: S' and I'm more of a large.  The hat is sold as 'One Size' but unfortunately that size appears to be small.  After speaking with their customer service it sounds like there may be another 'One Size' available that is a little larger.  After i try that one out i will update my review.    UPDATE: I was shipped their newest 'one size' hat.  This one came in size 'M' rather than 'S'.  It still does not fit so I will have to send it back.  Be wary if your head does not fit their 'one size' template.  The hats are not adjustable or flexible.  If you decide to buy, hopefully it will fit.
B00J2DLY42|5|I absolutely love this shirt. It fits perfectly and is so comfortable.
B0027Z1K4Q|4|My son is an avid guitar player and this shirt really put a smile on his face when he went through his stocking on Christmas morning!
B004Q6HVR4|4|These shorts are very comfortable and fit like a glove.  My only complaint is that there is no extra material in the back.  Meaning that if you have any sort of rear, it will indeed hang out of the shorts.  I am a size 0 and have a small back side and I still have a little cheek showing when I wear these shorts.  I got them to work out at home, so it is okay.  Just a fair warning.
B00MS4WF9U|2|Just OK, doesn't look as hot as the pictures on the model.
B005VEGD6K|3|Very sheer and thin. Good for the price, I suppose.
B00OZD9OU0|5|good!
B00UKNSXFG|3|Just okay.<br />For some reason these are not as thick & nice quality as I have come to expect from worlds softest socks, these definitely are not a favorite, but will do in a pinch.
B0029UJS9S|5|loved it
B00GTUE45W|5|My daughter loves this dress. The price was great, and it has held up through many washings. If you are deciding between two sizes, I would go with the next size up.
B008CF47V8|5|It was exactly what my husband wanted.<br />Inasmuch as it is nto wool, it becomes a<br />seasonal item to be worn wheneber.
B008KE4PKO|5|Good
B00C0FUXC8|5|Is very pretty , the only problem is the way you have to put in , but outside of that is great.
B008KGLRH6|3|The cut on the model was more appealing in the ad than on my figure. The sizing was way off and i should had stayed with my tru size. Although i buy medium i ended up getting an xlarge based on reviews. I'm a true size 8/10 and 5'4. I was swimming in the jacket.
B00NL0V0X2|4|beautiful fit. covered trouble areas well
B00BPXITTA|5|Great quality! Would definitely buy again.
B009BRKXQY|2|Not at all what was pictured. May return it!
B00AVVAW1K|2|This was a pretty dress but at least 2 sizes too small. It's hard enough to find time to shop when I finally have to shop on line it would be great if the sizing were consistent . Had to pay 10.00 to return the dress.
B00LFAND1M|5|A little lighter than i expected. Good quality. Warm. Cute. I would recommend it.
B00JKTB6GY|5|I ot it during black friday and it's the best jacket I now own. The pockets have this really lovely lining that's so comfortable and the jacket keeps you nice and warm!
B00O50K81C|5|Love it!!!!
B009D4389E|4|Purchased a few items for New Years.... Ended up wearing this.  Got a ton of complements.  I will wear again.  Very Happy New Year.
B009M023QI|5|This is a good fitting shirt that fits well and is long enough to not rise up on you when working out. The sweat control fabric works well also so that you do not have a dripping shirt after a workout. Nice shirt.
B00E1JOZHK|5|excelent
B00DAGPNGW|3|It's such a cute suit and fits so nice and flattering. Only problem is that the padding in the cups are small and wrinkled. I have a bigger chest and the cups make me look flat and like my boobs are disfigured. Other than that I adore the suit.
B0007YRQXS|5|I really like the fit and feel of these.  I hope they hold up after several washes.
B002QCF9BK|5|Its great walking in the mall and seeing ppls faces. LOL  But the size is true and the blood didn't fade out in the wash. This is a great idea.
B00R0UN6PO|2|Seemed to run a little large and was a little sheer for my taste.
B00IRLXWMM|2|It would have been a beautiful tie, were it not for a big stain on it. I would almost swear it had been worn before.
B00Q2DG0GC|2|For the price I suppose these are ok.  I am disappointed in the fabric though, they are a very loose terry cloth and the insides have way too much unfinished thread and loops that catch goes and toenails.  They were called microfiber and in my opinion are far from &#34;microfiber&#34; quality fabric.
B00LGX84HG|5|Super great to layer with.
B002PQXGCQ|4|she tried it on as soon as it arrived and it fit well she is even making plants to purchase more
B00F6MPOVM|4|I was a little suspect of these pants due to the low price, however, they are actually not bad. The material is a little thin but they kept me warm (for the most part) in temps down to 40-45 degrees.  They also sale a winter version which I'm sure would do quite well in cold weather. I purchased a large: I am 6'1, 205lbs with very long limbs and these actually fit me pretty good. I will definitely buy more.<br /><br />The package arrived within 2 weeks.<br /><br />Don't be alarmed when you take them out of the package; they look like they are going to be way to small but they stretch and are not too tight.
B007YBQN9U|3|Too long for my liking, but with some cutting and styling, makes for a fairly good Ciel Cosplay wig.
B001O9BEI8|5|These men's &#34;tighty-whities&#34; are very comfortable.  I like them because the material is slightly thicker and much softer than most other brands I've tried.  The waist band maintains it's elasticity very well.  Note: they tend to shrink a little bit after being washed.  I normally wear size 33-34.  But I have found that if I buy this item in a size 36, they fit very well.  They are not baggy at all.  Get &#34;one size larger&#34; than your usual size.
B00EDHW7H0|1|Was too small )-:
B00BTR0ZJE|2|I am a 34 waist and 165 lbs, these pants fit snug around the pockets. I thought they would split up the back seam when I sat down. The waist is not the problem, good fit there.<br />The pants do look great but unless you are very slim stay away.
B00HYF3PG0|5|Good
B001Z5PDEC|4|good basic product.  good fast shipping
B00LFANCYU|3|It is some what small however it feels great and looks even better.
B00009YRKO|5|I am purchasing this dress.  The colors are delightful.  The fabric is easy care.  It is an easy on-easy off style for ease in dressing.
B000L7L588|4|These are terrific, and the first pair of low cut socks that don't slide down in my shoes. Love them!
B0084HK84O|3|This is a pretty basic scrub top.  Fabric is just OK, a little scratchy but that should improve with repeated washings.  Fit seems true to size. The color is good, and the price was also very good.
B007ZH8FB2|5|Love the money belt, Just whish I could keep if full on Hundies.....
B005X5HHBC|5|This bra was recommended to me by my petite but big chested roommate, and I held off on buying it for a while because it is a bit on the pricy side.  However, it is well worth the money!<br /><br />I normally wear a DD, so after reading some other reviews, both here and on other websites, I picked an E cup.  It fits beautifully! And unlike most sports bras, you'll look and feel awesome in it, because it doesn't just smush them into the unflattering uniboob.<br /><br />If you're going to be doing high impact exercises, I would definitely recommend hooking the straps together - there's a little hook on the left strap for exactly that purpose - it reigns the girls in just that extra little bit, and you won't get the usual bounce.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I highly recommend this bra, especially if you do high impact activities! It's a beautiful synthesis of function and fashion. Well worth the money!
B00B0QLYVC|3|I read mostly good reviews for this dress and it seemed to be a good pick from this seller but it fits a bit strangely on me. The shoulders seem to be a bit wide but it's not a huge, huge problem. The torso is rather small as well, although the length of the dress overall is great. I'm average build so I'm not slender like the model shown and maybe that's why the dress fits a little strangely, so I think I would recommend this only if you're quite skinny and not very curvy (ie don't have a large bust). I will probably wear the dress a little in the summer...not as much as I would have liked but I definitely won't be wearing it to any dates or anything as it's not nearly as flattering as it is on the model.
B00KVF1AJY|5|Fits amazingly and SO comfortable!
B00SSXGC12|1|too small, i expected side boob; however, its more like nipple.
B00MMZDJLS|3|Just okay. Not really worth buying online. The material is so light/cheap! I thought i could be a winter dress for my daughter but nop it more of a summer kind of dress :-(
B00JJEGS6I|3|Its more like a girls sweater than a mans.
B00NT4BNMI|5|like everything about it
B00KVS1WO4|4|Love the dress but it will need to be tailored slightly
B00XRHPU1M|3|Larger bottoms, smallish top...
B003M59FTW|5|Love it, feels nice. I like the sleek design and the ID see through on the opposite side. I recommend it.
B003ICEKPI|5|I like this hoodie.  It was a great fit and I like the thickness of the fleece.  Will be nice and warm for fall and will look great with the STL Cardinals patch we have to put on it! :-)
B00PIM6ERI|5|thanks love it
B00KBX3XT6|5|Son loves it.
B00HVEBYWQ|1|Definitely not the cap i ordered... very disappointed.
B00144HXG0|4|the dresses fit fine, but the bust size of the person makes the dress fit differently.
B00874DUNK|4|By mistake I ordered 2 of the same pair and they came in slightly different colors=))<br />Actually I needed light jeans, they aren't like but nice and comfy)<br />So my size is 1, but it is ok after the laundry and next day I can take them off without unbuttoning)<br />Well, but it's hard to find something with good quality for my size, so I decided to keep 2 of them.<br />Also price for this quality is really good)
B00IFDBEHW|3|I would have definitely given it more than 3 stars but tomorrow will make 4 weeks using it only on Mondays thru Fridays and the seam on the right side has popped so now the plastic wire is poking me under the inside fabric unless I adjust it every now and then.  It does the job of shrinking your waist line but if I had known that this would happen, I would have invested in the cincher with steel rods.  Overall, it's good, maybe I am just too rough with it.  It definitely gives me that perfect coke bottle figure and it does make me sweat a lot.  Be aware that it is very tiny when u first get it.  I bought a 36, Medium bc I'm a 36DD, and it was difficult to put on at first, but after the first week, u get the hang of it.  Another negative factor is that it marks ur skin on ur lower back under the waist line, so just be careful with sizing.  I can't stress how tiny it is, the first time, 4 weeks ago, I could only wear it for 4 hours tops.  Now I can do about 7 hours per day, almost 4 weeks later so it takes getting use to.
B00AX8FUD6|5|Everyone loves this shirt and lots of people think it looks like their dog. Nice cotton, washes nice, but better not to dry it. I dried another one with a different dog face, and it shrunk in length by about 4 inches.
B00817EA82|4|Perform as expected.  Hold all the parts in place and adequately cover exits.  Comfortable and seem to be beefy enough to hold up to extended wash/wear cycles.  For me hat means minimum 15 years until all they disintegrate.  Now I can retire my old ones which consist basically of three big holes held together by a microfiliment of underwear molecules.
B002DH6GMO|5|Even though this is a \\"costume hat,\\" the quality is great.  Nothing flimsy about it.  Great detailing, and it fits my pretty-big-head.
B00QNR8AEC|5|Wonderful!
B00Q2H1DGA|1|I ordered a 3x and it took a LONG time to come and then it was a VERY small coat. I couldn't return it and I'm out 40 Plus dollars. I have to give it away to a man that wears a med/large normally. It fit him good. I do not recommend this
B004TIP31A|5|The werewolf claws were great.  I order them for my husband and the fit was great.  The quality was good for the price.  They completed his outfit.
B00DQZI90E|5|So comfy and cute. I need a pair in every color. Fits perfect!
B00E8GRKVO|4|Perfect Ugly sweater for the holiday.  This sweater is well made and good quality. Machine washable. Still looks new after washing.  Very original theme. Got a lot of laughs at the party.
B000YGH3EG|5|I love this bra. Its a little small, but I got back & forth between a B cup & small C cup! So comfortable!
B00HQCY48Y|5|Very high quality jersey. People gaave me lots of love when I wear it
B00DM0R6QG|4|I like it
B005WDE2AO|4|This bra fits true to size and is also very comfortable at a reasonable price.  I would recommend this bra to the women I know.
B00EF581RA|3|I have bought this pajamas for my 2-year-old boy and it is somewhat small. I have bought the same brand pajamas in a different color and they are bigger than this one even though are both the same size (2T).
B00HTCF1FG|3|Didn't like how it fitted and it did not fit like a small
B00JMJRIQO|4|Color is nice.  The large is more like an XL, but not so badly for me to return it.
B002XGZTK0|5|As others have said here, these are fantastic. From the luxurious feel, the quality construction, to the tasteful packaging, everything about this product and vendor speaks high quality. And of course there's nothing like a pair of silk pajamas! You'll love them.
B00IVNMR3Q|5|Love this belt!  Love it.<br /><br />Elastic and buckle are completely flat.  The stretch holds up my pants without strangling me in my middle.  Belt is adjustable so it can be as tight or as loose as you need.  The buckle is well designed; it opens and closes simply and effectively.  Easy to undo in those mad-dashes to the ladies room too (always a plus!).  :)<br /><br />I bought the gray which seems to blend with most of my outfits.  Wouldn't say it's a belt I want people to see exactly but under tops, it's perfect.<br /><br />Seemed a bit expensive when I added it to my cart, but once I saw the quality, the price is completely reasonable.
B008KO8H4E|3|Who the hell would buy the Small size of this shirt? The sizes should start at XXL and go up from there!
B009UTZG9W|5|This shirt was a great price, so I was a little worried it would be cheap material but it was really good quality. Very satisfied with my purchase.
B009G54LIC|4|I have several other SeV products and since I was shopping for some new slacks I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />First off, the fabric quality is excellent. These pants have the same quality fabric that you find in most of the higher end khaki's and cotton dress slacks. They look good enough for a night on the town or a business meeting.<br /><br />Second, the pockets are wonderful. The two front pockets are very deep, almost half way down my thigh, so you can carry most anything you would normally put in your pants with plenty of room and no bulge from a overfilled pocket. There is even a smaller pocket within the pocket to keep things organized.<br /><br />As with all the other SeV products I have purchased, I'm very pleased with the quality and function. While $70 seems a lot to pay for another pair of pants, these are well worth the extra just for the added carrying capacity.<br /><br />Also, the new waistband will stretch with you, so if you happen to go out and have a big meal, or put on a few pounds over vacation, you wont' feel squeezed.
B005CSOKVA|3|This pullover tends to fit large. I should've gotten a size down.
B00JO6ZCVS|3|Well this dress fits my body very well I wear a medium usually so I went a size bigger. There is one problem with this swim suit it was meant for some one with no boobs or an A cup, so my C cups look like they are escaping. It has a padded top and come with extra padding I had to take that out but the top still doesn't fit  nicely, I want this to be my cute conservative swim suit but it makes me look like a got a boob job to like a D or DD, so I wear it when it's just me swimming.
B00HEP3WY0|1|elastic was so strong  I could not stretch it over my head as I had shoulder replacement surgery. that is why I wanted to try this bra.
B007ZTL3LE|5|This is a great quality wallet and very cute. The cat bus is a favorite among Totoro fans, especially my wife. The bus takes dead people to paradise.
B0139JPGD4|5|Looks great and says what we the people want.
B002AQ21E0|5|Fits exactly as I had hoped. Quite comfortable in a relaxed feel yet well manicured look. Looking forward to adding these to my rotation of work slacks.
B00EKNQV42|5|Was a gift for a friend. He said he loves it. Why must they insist that I write more when that's all I have to write??
B00M4919DW|5|Came in perfectly, and quick!
B004U7SN8A|3|As someone has said it's different then you think it will be. I figured it would have the elastic sting or a tie to hold the mask on. Instead it's a head band. You first put the headband part on then slide down the mask.It fits on but I would of rather had a type of elastic sting.
B0018OFRIM|5|ordered 34w x 38l in prewashed and they fit great. single stitshed in the inseam and only 5 buttons, but they fit great. I would still rather have shrink to fot 34w x 40L. but good alternative.
B001JQLQNY|5|I'm actually kind of between sizes - and right on the cusp of sizes that people just don't make - so finding something that fits that I can also afford is next to impossible.  In general, I keep an eye on Amazon for this brand, as it occasionally goes on sale for a price I can afford from time to time.  The 36K that I ordered fits better than anything else that I currently own and it has been a refreshing change, despite the underwire, which not my preference.  I really probably wear a 34L, but the few options I have available in that size are way out of my price range, so until I lose more weight or the band stretches, this is perfect.
B004EHL6JO|1|I channeled honest Abe Lincoln when I put it on, so it was worth the 11 grand.  Unfortunately some guy ran out from behind the curtain and shot me in the head, so it sorta wasn't worth the 11 grand.
B00FAPNFPM|5|My Grandson loves Superman & Batman!  I was happy that both were included with this purchase.  I purchased the size 8, even though he usually takes 7.  Perfect fit!  He has had them on every night since his birthday.  If you have a super hero fan this is a perfect gift.
B00FEMK2V6|4|its a little big
B0037LENUC|4|Works well, but I think the original (not bamboo) works better.
B00K8RMEZY|5|My kid.loves it..it has soft cozy fleece material inside.
B0037Z5BVS|5|Very comfortable and more than what I expected excellent quality!!
B0098JUMDY|5|She loves these....Need I say more??
B007MRZF4A|4|Can't beat 12 pairs of undies for $20. I got 2 of each colors; white., black, pink, purple, grey and light blue. I love the solid colors. The bows fell off a few pairs, that was kinda disappointing but still wearable. Also a few strings are already unraveling. This can be because the tag says hand wash and line dry. Seriously who has time for that? I wash on delicate and low heat dry, no issues other then the bows coming off. When the other comments said to order one size up, they are not kidding! I usually wear a 7-large, I have wide hips, so I got the extra large. They fit perfectly around my hips, but do ride up my butt often. I guess its always an issue with full butt undies.<br />Over all these are comfortable, super cute and like I said you can't beat 12 pairs for only $20.
B00FKFA8OI|4|This is a lightweight knot sweater. It's exactly what we needed for our ugly sweater party. No surprises.  Sized true to fit.
B009QD1H2W|3|I was expecting something with a bit more heft to it than this. The price was okay and the quality seems to be there, but it is extremely thin material and doesn't really keep my neck that warm.
B002698064|5|loved it
B0090AUIJE|2|I had to send these back as they were very unflattering and uncomfortable (too tight around the middle and cling to the thighs and butt); not a &#34;woman's&#34; cut!
B00IU5VZRE|5|I absolutely love this.
B00KL6DXSO|5|Love Le Mystere, it's the only bra I wear, knew I would love the sports bra. Perfect for not showing cleavage while in yoga! When I tried the criss-cross back option, it felt somewhat awkward under the arms. Le Mystere is the best for small band sizes and larger cup sizes.
B00CB42ZWO|5|I like it
B00EAE0KGQ|5|My husband loves Star Wars so I'm always on the look out for baby stuff. This onesie is super cute and big enough that my 6week old son will be able to wear it a few times.
B00BUFPP6S|4|Well-made. Has withstood many washings without the slightest decline in quality.<br />If your upper body is muscular (not body builder big but definitely well-developed) you might have a tight fit around the chest and shoulders, restricting mobility of the arms. Color and fit matche amazon's depiction.
B000KGIELQ|5|Tan or &#34;nude&#34; trouser socks are hard to find. Most folks probably just get knee-high hose. These are very sturdy, have slightly reinforced toe, and they STAY UP, which is amazing. I am quite tall, so that is a boon. I will be buying more of these. They are warmer than hose, but not bulky at all. They work very well with dressy or casual shoes.
B00WLF12SQ|5|Very nice pants
B0059DCX3K|5|Very pretty!!
B006POH1O8|5|Nice material,like the little touch of a turtle neck.keeps you warm!
B00SNHU5YS|3|It is a pretty dress but I would go way smaller than you expect. I wear a 15 so I got a 16 and it was way too big. I got a 14 and the bust was still too big. Then I had to go another route because the wedding was a few days later.
B008S7HIY8|5|The outfit is a bit short (I'm 5', 7\\") but its still baggy and comfortable, I'm just going to put boots on with it. The fleece material is super warm and comfy making the whole ensemble is uber cute and functional. Ordered it 3-5 day shipping and it was received within that time so very excited to have this in time for Halloween events coming up.
B00Q7Q0DEY|5|Super slim and doesn't scratch like most leather. Its true to picture. Holds a good grip of cash
B005UALYJG|5|This by far the best purchase that I have made for my camera storage collection!  It stores everything perfectly and is comfortable to wear while frequently accessing all of your items.  I hold my digital camera, canon digital eos camera, canon lenses and a compact camera as well as all of the av cables and power cables for each one.  It also stores my wallet! Truly awesome product and designed very well.
B00NV8QE62|1|I couldn't fit in this if my life depended on it, its just way too small! Didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I ended up donating it. At least whoever gets it will be able to actually see the size before they buy it.
B002B6339Q|4|Good quality overall
B001GQSK36|4|Comfy beanie, my old one blew out the top stitch and I had to sew it up. But still<br />Comfy. I like em!
B0055M8FLE|2|Shrank after first wash and dry on low , very disappointed
B006W901NO|4|It works great to slim you down but after a while mine seems to rise up and thats with my shirt tucked in. so be prepared to go to the bathroom often to pull it down
B00K1XF862|3|Tight tight tight, but am keeping in the hope that I will fit into them down the line, and with the aid of the right top, be able to wear them to work (make a nice change for the usual black and navy pants).
B00H5IS2ZU|5|Was looking for a dress like Disneys Elsa from frozen but not just a dress up one, one that she can wear out and about. this is the dress now just add a white cardigan! My daughter turned 9 and is small build so the Medium fits perfect! Thank you!
B007S9U9SE|5|Great fitting summer-weight oxford shirt. The fit is very flattering. It's not a big shirt, but comfortably roomy. It tapers sightly at the waistline. Giving a really nice shape, even if waistline isn't particularly defined. It's long and lean...not boxy fitting.  The length is 30\\"  This shirt looks good buttoned up or left open over a tank top. The fabric is soft and cool. The collar is understated and comfortable around the neck. The sleeves are slightly fuller with a slightly, longer length, short sleeve. The colors are very soft. It doesn't wrinkle excessively. Nice quality. It looks cool and crisp.
B00HHGIFUM|5|excellent ,high quality, my favorite shirt atm!
B007SD4K8K|5|Thanks
B00QTLBYPO|5|Love my wallet thought it was smaller but when it came in I love it and it's super cute 😍❤️
B00IZATPE4|5|Better than expected!
B00OTM8F1G|4|Good fit, exactly what I expected.
B008SODASO|5|I love this waist belt with my sexy pink dress, it shows my figure as it it. Good customer service, I would recommend this to my friends.
B00829QXSY|5|I purchased this for my wife and he loved the color, fit, feel and design.  She commented on the ¾ length sleeves and practicality of the pockets.  We would recommend this sweater to others.
B008D5H3N6|3|a little disappointed in the quality and runs large (size chart is off)! Happy that I found mittens on a string though!
B00MHPCPU4|1|Shirt was cheaply made compared to others made by this company and it was overall too small.  Returned it
B00MVI7RU0|4|I bought this because I had purchased a pair in Tuesday Morning about 4 years ago and they are still in great shape, no fading, very comfortable.  The combination of Rayon95% Spandex5% makes a wonderful and breathable fabric, holds its shape, size, color does not fade (a rayon attribute), no shrinkage, comes out of the dryer unwrinkled and even if I leave it laying in a heap on the bed it is still unwrinkled.  I can't say I like this style or color as well as my older pjs (which I still wear) but I'm sure it will hold up as well as the last pair and be just as comfortable.  These were twice as expensive as the ones I bought in Tuesday Morning (on sale), but I wanted to have another pair.  I have since found a third pair at Walmart, same fabric, for about $11.88 for the top, same for the bottom.  Label &#34;George&#34; , and I expect them to wear as well.  These pjs are great, comfortable, and wear well.  Highly recommend anything with this fabric mix.
B003VTXE3M|5|Great buy on these panties.  I usually pay much more for them.  If there are any flaws I haven't found them.
B00LH2LIKG|5|I chose this coat for the nice quality and good price<br />For my little body, the small size is very fit and feel very well.<br />By the way, this time the carrier is very fast speed, so 5 Stars is absolute
B00UECPDKQ|5|It was awesome and fit my wife great!
B00PLGRFGU|5|The dress for the entire summer!  It's rayon, so it will wrinkle a little.  No worries though.  It's so cute and so very comfortable.  I'm 5'6&#34; and the length is great for flat, cute sandals without dragging the ground.  It is not lined (fabric is fine without the need for a lining), light weight and perfect for any spring or summer day or night.  I ordered the medium, my usual size and it fits perfect!  I love it!
B007IEGMHG|3|I didn't end up using the cape because it was WAY too tight and choked me.  The top was ridiculously uncomfortable.  I ended up only using the mask and the tutu and bought a new shirt to go with it.  It worked out great though.  Compromise.  If I could have bought the tutu alone, I would have.
B0065Q5WJC|3|Although it is very pretty, and feels great, this bra is paper thin. You can't really wear it under a T-shirt. You could wear it with another undergarment like a slip, or shaper. Otherwise around the house only.
B0002TOSL6|5|VERY,VERY COMFORTABLE! I WILL PURCHASE OTHER GOLD TOE PRODUCTS!
B0009MH0ZM|4|The shirts have a beautiful fit, just I imagined. Thank you Amazon.com
B00507H1HS|4|The picture on the shirt was a little smaller than I expected, but I'm very happy with it anyway!(:
B00CF275CW|5|This is the best nursing bra I have found to date! It looks like my style of bra with the functionality of a nursing bra. Thank you for making such a great product! Finding a bra in a 34 H was nearly impossible and this is perfect!
B002LE8I52|5|The pants were just perfect.  None of the other major retailers had 100% wool pants.  Amazon came to my resceu.
B00F6RJPDA|4|This shirt fit my son as I expected it to.  He is 9 and I bought him the medium because he doesn't have a slim build.  The shirt is long on him and even a little baggy, but that is what I was going for.  The picture is great and of my son's favorite doctor.
B00LI4NLFI|5|Exactly what was shown. Cute head pieces. Wish the colors were more practical though.
B0090FSU9Y|1|Product was still to small for me. For larger women this product is no recommended. Even though it says large it will still be to small. It run small.
B00GFHCBRC|5|My son was able to wear this too the beach for hours in Ft. Lauderdale Beach in August and didn't have to worry about sunburn.
B005CSNVWY|3|Tried to shrink in the dryer - not enough. Keeping as they are comfy for around the house.
B004CLX7R6|3|I liked the idea, and it looked cute, but this has ZERO support and even though I'm not the biggest on top it does not cover me at all (literally, almost no coverage). I have ended up wearing a sleep bra underneath.
B00Z8Z6RDQ|5|very nice, love the color
B00V34TA4Y|5|Classic.Classy as expected from AK.
B000SOJTLE|4|T[[ASIN:B000SOJTLE Vanity Fair Women's Beautiful Benefits Molded Lace Modern Posture Back Bra #75-188]]  This is the most comfortable bra you will ever own.  If you have shoulder pain, or back pain this bra will reduce the pain.  The bra hits higher up on the shoulders to reduce the pain.  I wore this bra after my both shoulder surgeries, and neck.  This bra is great because you never have straps sliding down.  This bra is so comfortable that you can sleep in it.
B00GLJA518|5|Trend and confortable.
B00565W91M|5|Shipped quickly, good packaging. I order these jeans because they fit and flatter the figure.  I'm short and a lot of jeans don't come in junior short sizes. There is also a good selection of styles and colors.  Mainly I buy these cause they don't gap in the waist and fit comfortably in the leg.  Levi is a well made jean.
B00KIGU84O|3|I love the print, but I got to be honest it is super small.  It is so small throughout my stomach it is a spanx and the flowing skirt ends up being a pencil skirt.  I am attaching a photo for you to see the difference in size.  I have a normal maxi shirt in the same exact size and it is over 5 inches longer.  (Photo shows 4 inches on one side with a measuring tape and another inch on the other side so you can see that I am not covering anything up).  The material is silky but believe me if you are a true plus size girl, keep this in mind.  It's tight!
B004LT8O36|4|This was my &#34;go to&#34; hat all winter (whew and what a long winter it was!).  It is soft, warm and comfy and can be dressed up or dressed down.
B001IVZ7BM|5|Fit perfectly and comfy!
B006ZTQWR0|5|Love this sweater.  In 5' 8&#34; 140 and the medium fits perfecly.  It's extra long, but I love that.  It's great quality,  soft, and comfortable.  I want anothe color!!
B00IWL0E5U|5|nice quailty
B00A83625Q|5|The fit of this dress was perfect on me!  The color was very much to my liking and the chiffon-like material was very pretty!  I received several compliments from people that I didn't even know the first time that I wore this dress.  It has quickly become one of my favorites!
B00LVVJ8QY|2|Cheap looking and that plastic tie looked even cheaper. There are no belt loops so you just hang it around the hanger and maybe lose it.
B00LVHN0BW|1|Beware that the hoodie is made of a polyester blend fur (cheap). Not a sherpa.
B00NXEF3AM|3|These would qualify for trunks and not briefs.
B00LD7D272|4|The color is nice and so it is the quality. It fits well.
B001LPCMIQ|1|Purchased these at the same time that I ordered another pair of Bellyqueen pants in Navy Blue and they are much too small for an average size 8-10 person. As with the other review, I recommend that only petite people size 4 or smaller order these pants. They are snug and short. Additionally, there are no return instructions of return label included in the order and no one answers the phone at this Cambridge, MA seller. We'll see if email works better.
B00H2QS3T0|5|I love this robe! Great colors and texture.
B00H02ZDT4|5|Love it!  Keeps me hands free and I can still talk or have Siri text for me while staying safe on the road.
B0077P4PVQ|5|This shorts are sexy as soon as i put them on i want to have sex.
B002JWF6OC|5|Very nice, sturdy item.  My 9 year old son wanted it to hold some cards and small treasures, and he's very happy with it!
B00A0HZD6O|4|It's not a eeny weeny teeny tiny poke-a-dot bikini but it looks kool. Almost as kool as our Roxy Roxy Roxy.
B0088MHP64|5|I'm 5'6&#34; this and dress is absolutely perfect! I was a bit concerned at first because I originally ordered a medium and I'm glad I did! Paired with some gold shoes and jewelry will definitely make you stand out!
B00CJQGQAG|4|Like others say, it's not very puffy. But it looks fine either way. I've always wanted one of these. There is a seam on the back where the tulle connects. But it's not very noticeable.
B007XEXEXQ|4|Because of the excellent quality of it.<br />It seemed to be cut a little smaller than I figured for my husband though.
B002UJLJEA|5|Great item.  Beautiful hair.  Adjustable fit.
B00NUO49VE|4|Really nice costume dress.  The front of the dress is very nicely detailed and I love the sequin pattern. But the back is somewhat sheer. So I definitely need nude/beige underwear and a slip for this dress.  I was worried because the sizing on the details is for sizes 0-4. Im 5ft7in,  145 lbs and the dress fit me perfectly. Its about 3 inches above my knee.  Overall I consider a great costume dress and worth the money.
B00RZPTECS|5|Looks good on my husband. Slim Fit but not too close or too tight.
B00CHQ4F2O|5|this is so soft and my husband says it is the best gift he has gotten this year. Very good quality, nicely made and holding up to washing nicely.
B00QSEN0X6|5|Fits just like it should. It made a little girl happy.
B00DS0WNF4|4|Buy a size up. It looks really good though for under $20.
B007OUJCF8|4|I bought from Australia and very happy with the fit and quality only problem they are too long and I did order the medium.
B00Q59VWC0|5|Best training pants. Will buy again
B003TJ9EXI|5|My son loves it!!!
B00J3KNY2Y|5|Cute
B00H8RRBUU|5|My son has become particular about his shorts, wanting them to be long enough to cover his knees.  These are very long, and he loves them for this reason.
B00781BJ8Q|5|Sizing is important with this bra.  If you don't wear the correct size, you may be missing out on the separation it provides.  The cups need to be large enough to contain your breasts or else you will be \\"squished\\" together, which I do not find attractive.<br /><br />I had to experiment a bit as I had lost quite a bit of weight and my old bras were useless. They looked really bad.  But even with the correct size, other bras just didn't \\"do it\\" for me.  However, this one is great!  The wires between your \\"boobs\\" lay flat against your chest and the whole design of the bra gives you an excellent shape, with no bulges at the sides.  It also gives an overall round shape, not pointy in the front.  I am delighted to have found this, as it is so difficult to find a well-fitting bra.<br /><br />I don't recommend it, but I have washed this in my machine in a lingerie bag on a gentle cycle (I have a front loader with no agitator) and it has turned out perfectly so far.  But I do take it out right away and reshape it and just lay it out to dry.<br /><br />I would suggest that everyone who is looking for a good fit in a bra give this one a try, but be careful with the size!  Just love it!
B00N3Y1MXO|5|Sooo comfy and cute! Soft and warm and fits just right! Highly recommend. High quality material.
B002IUGGGM|5|I use this with my Dell 11z - I have the 3 cell battery, not the larger 6 cell, and the case fits perfectly.  I like the rich royal blue color, with the reversible black as a more subdued option.  Great price, too!
B00FP462DK|5|This is an excellent solution to the \\"floppy tie syndrome\\" (FTS). I hate having my tie flip around in the wind or get skewed when I take off my jacket.  These work very well, don't damage your tie, and are inexpensive.  I love these so much, any time I see a guy with his tie flapping in the wind, I want to run up to him and hand him one of these. They're inexpensive enough that I could carry a bunch of them with me and do just that!
B00B796X9A|5|This hoodie is soft and arrived before the delivery date. The only thing is i ordered on sixe larger bc i read the reviews where it said they run small this is a lie unless you want your hoodie baggie. I normally wear a medium because i like form fitting hoodies so if you dont want your hoodie baggy just order your regular size. as far as the product goes its pretty awesome
B00C6AAZK2|5|Awesome! A very high quality and distinctive shirt. I love it.
B00DG9FSTK|5|This fits like a glove, especially the way it hugs your butt.
B001EEIPFI|4|I am very happy with my purchase of the jessica rabbit costume. It fits better than what it looks in the picture. Very glam
B005XFQGD2|5|love this bra but straps way too short, let all the way out still pulled the back way up above where the front is....would have been great if more adjustment room in straps for length
B00D1R7YAI|5|I have been waist training a while now! So I got the medium it FITS perfectly!!! It is sooo pretty! Well made, I just ordered the Black one and a blue one! Very very pretty and well made! Came in 2 days!
B002NM8BZ4|5|was a hit
B00LPCZ61K|2|Too small and zipper busted
B007IJPU60|2|I really like Downeast Basics tops, and I like v-necks on me, but this top I did not like.  The fit felt weird - like it would not stay in place. I'd have to keep pulling down the front to keep it on right or it would just ride back.  I do like the half sleeve feature, but I don't really like the hem on the sleeves.
B009UZW9LE|1|I was looking to put together a Charlie Brown costume for a party and when I received the shirt the material was really cheap and the size of the shirt is really odd. It's definitely not made like a normal shirt. The shirt itself was to small but it fit in the shoulders but than it was short at the waist. If you are looking for a really cheap Charlie Brown look than go for it.
B006C5ZSZO|5|VERY GOOD EXCELLENT ORIGINAL  MATERIAL , A NICE CAP FOR THE $$$$$$$$$$$
B00DRGJTJM|5|So tired of spending so much on yoga pants.  These are perfect
B00KMUOL9O|5|my little niece looked so cute in this outfit, I brought it for her for Christmas she wears a size 2t, and that`s the size I ordered. it fit perfectly
B009P6XYYO|5|This is a great wallet to purchase for anyone in your life who craves organization in their pocket. I have bought this wallet 3 times now for several different people and they have all loved it and carried it for many years. It is a nice change from a traditional 3 fold wallet that feels like a speed bump in your back pocket when you sit down.<br />Note to Amazon buyers: This wallet is much cheaper if you buy it directly from Coach. I have seen different vendors trying to sell it for $100 or more on this website, and that is way overpriced. Be smart and compare. Also, I bought this wallet through a 3rd party vendor who shipped it to me in different packaging. I know this because I bought the same wallet via Coach not too long ago. I don't want to accuse them of selling me a fake, but through 3rd party sellers, you just can't be sure.
B00XJTOWB2|5|Before washing i loved this dress .... too short after laundry... i returned it with no problems
B00AVB17E6|4|Not quite fit expected but good pant
B002WQR1T8|1|I know it says that it is an ADULT costume but it is made for kids. Do not buy unless you're buying it for a kid!!!
B00DF16TXS|5|i've had a few pairs that have lasted over 7 or 8 years.  These are very similar, unlike other companies, they haven't outsourced and cheapened the products. nice padding and support
B007SU59OW|4|OK but the fabric shrinkage
B00JRW6T2A|2|it is not a good quality product, and the sizes are pretty small.<br />Nice colour
B00VHD47QW|5|Awesome wallet, something you don't find where I live
B000TFSODG|5|your jacket really surpised me. I was expecting to return it thinking it would bee too tight somewhere but it fit perfact.<br />It is a very nice jacket for the money.
B00HHOXWA2|5|The coat is very warm.  I really enjoy the style because I do not see this coat anywhere.  I ordered an larger size and I am amazed it does not look too big.  I recommend this coat to everyone.
B0093NRFBM|5|I ordered the dress for my second niece in Suriname without knowing her size.  I just pictured her and read the size char and make my decision. We all love the dress. Just as aspected.
B00BHILMLK|5|i AM 5'6&#34; AND THE SHORT ARE PLENTY LONG ENOUGH.  STAY UP NICELY.
B0013NTGYO|5|great product.
B008GGFC1M|4|I like this product.<br />I forgot to check if the footwear was part of the costume (my bad).
B00CJP3AME|5|I gambled and bought this pair despite the one review saying that the size was way off.  25 regular I bought fit just like 25 regular at other major jeans store.  It was a good deal with the discount, and I am happy with my purchase.  Quality is good.
B001PULAJ4|5|I got this tie for a halloween costume for my 7 year old. he absolutely loves it!! He wants to wear it to church every week he loves it so much! and it fits him well on the smallest setting even though it is the adult size.
B007R7FVWG|5|Great pair of jeans my son plays in the jeans and they never rip.. I'll have to order again in the future
B00B9TX45E|3|If anyone orders the pants, get a size bigger than what you wear. It would be a better fit for you
B00HBJSYTW|1|Way too large
B00E0HHRDM|5|... these pants, they fit as seen on the model and look very professional ! Would definitely recommend to a friend. I can't wait to wear them to work!
B001IAHP04|5|Excellent shirt, heavy weight. Tall size is not overly long.
B00JJ6VS98|4|They should come out with a Yvonne Craig, Batgirl shirt. Do you know how many people love her?
B009C0413G|1|I received the items on time. But the problem is some hats are tight for my baby and some are loose. And flower clips are good but the hat design is not good.. Its not looking good on my baby. Edges of the hat has some elastic which leaves mark on babies forehead and it doesnot look good at all. I had great hope about this product but it doesnot look tht great on baby. I won't recommend this product.
B002JDYH0K|2|I bought these for a costume. The latches were pretty flimsy and didn't hold onto the pants well. They kept coming unbuckled.
B00L5SFKD8|2|Yes I know these are tights but they are very cheap and thin. I love the patterns but they are just not going to work for me.
B00K2F1P5C|5|Awesome
B0092SOWIM|1|If you like this tshirt then you're an insensitive racist. The world would be better off without you and your outdated xenophobic views.
B00CBLTMAA|5|Very comfortable.  That's why I only buy Hanes underwear.
B00KSL96QA|3|Not quite was I was looking for but it kinda works. The only flaw I have with this product is that it leaves an awkward crease between you butt and thighs. If you are wearing jeans or legging it's not that noticeable but not wearing a tight dress ... I don't think this will do the trick
B0018ON6K8|5|Knowing your size is important for obvious reasons, but most of all I don't need to go looking (spent time before looking for this size) for this odd size.  great, fast and exactly what I wanted.<br />thanks again<br />M
B00VLBR6TU|4|fabric isnt see-through. fit's great. the bottom part of it is pretty baggy though if you couldnt tell from the picture, which is how it should be. i got the small and the size is true. looks almost lingerie-esk when you have it on. super cute tho, exactly like the picture. Love it!!!
B00BKRMMOE|4|Nice dress even the fabric is to soft
B002X0DWX2|5|nice scarf and like the color
B00FM5AT3G|5|these are fantastic for kids as they fit amazingly and are super comfortable and light. Money worth spending!!!
B004GEVAV4|5|For a girl, this hat is really ugly. However, when you are in negative degree weather, fashion goes out the window and you just want to be warm! This hat does the job and fits my huge head. Also, if you wear frumpy clothes in a desperation to keep warm, the unattractiveness of the hat is less noticeable.
B0055WQI5O|5|Tights arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I needed.  The red is a beautiful shade and the texture of the tights will be warm when the winter winds blow.
B004CJ5KDM|3|good
B00IYM6QRW|5|Great and comfy dress, and made in the USA.
B00FDLXN6Y|5|recommend
B00P2T251Q|4|They actually stayed up all day!
B001H0FQEM|5|Bought these for my husband for work. Comfortable and fit as expected.
B007WWZM2K|5|My daughter loves it!
B00ACIGNH4|5|This was quite the bargan, will buy more
B002GMDDP4|2|Sadly, this is way too big & I'll be returning it. I've bought from JMS before & not had any problems though!!
B00NER92J6|5|Love it. Fells and looks great.
B00ARHJTHG|5|These are the best no show socks I have ever worn. They were so perfect, I forgot about them. Usually with no show socks you can feel them slipping or sliding but these are the best!
B00GQ8OWTU|3|As other reviewers have stated it's VERY rough/stiff even after washing/drying.  That can be good if you want it to keep it's shape, and it looks really nice.  It is large so it doesn't fold up and fit in my back pocket nicely.<br /><br />We ended up putting it on our dog and she looks awesome!  We've gotten lots of unsolicited complements on her wearing it.  The most memorable being that our dog &#34;looks fresh&#34; when they saw it was a Pendleton.
B003BSMK60|4|These are comfortable and absorb sweat well. They are very long, so if you are tall, they would be a great choice. I'm a bit short, so I have to fold up the ankles.
B008GRCE8U|2|I've used it twice and already presents impairment. not what I expected. Nice design but poor quality, t t y
B00CE8PGLO|5|Love this!
B00KN7YSD0|5|Absolutely love!
B009XHPYDY|5|Relaxed fit, not too tight, fit nicely at the ankle!!  Couldn't be happier, and the material is nice and soft, not scratchy!!
B009KVNC9Q|4|This is the cutest sweater tunic I have seen!! It looks great with my uggz and leggings I would recommend this item for sure
B003OQTY54|5|When you see Carhartt on an item of clothing, you can be sure that you are getting an article of clothing that is high quality.  I'm convinced of this as each item I've purchased of theirs has fit comfortably and taken the abuse I put my clothes through.  You will get your monies worth out of this shirt.
B00R0OBAZI|1|This was like $2 so what do you know?? lol its to be expected but it really was a waste. This wasn't even stitched correctly so when I put it on it was lopsided and huge. Perhaps I could repurpose the lace!
B00PPZHDR8|5|Great fit
B00E7W67MW|5|gracias
B00124DDGG|5|I have been searching my whole life for a bra that could FINALLY support (and separate) me while exercising! This bra is perfect. I use it almost every day when I do my weightlifting and cardio at the gym. Too bad though its been unavailable for awhile. I hope they are not discontinuing it.
B00NLH2H1E|1|The fabric is quite thin and it is definetely not &#34;no-iron&#34;.
B000E99ZXA|5|I purchased these as leggings to wear underneath tunic-length shirts. They are 100% opaque, which was particularly important to me. I am a size 8-10 and a L fit me very well. I could have gone with a M but wanted the extra room to avoid any potential \\"muffin top.\\"
B00DVRCRN2|2|sized extremely large and no shape to dress.....not a fit and flare as described.....I might buy if the sizing were better
B0096UOJHU|5|Style is useful - I wear them in evening before bed, and in mornings till I have to go out.  I'd but another pair if similar in/out of bed look.
B00KMY2ZLQ|5|Beautiful color - great value - great feel
B004IT2O4Y|1|ordered the size i wear in any other brand  too big to wear, threw them away. might as well threw my money out the window. Learned my lesson, ordered jockey brand
B008EWNCD8|5|Nice socks... fit as expected and quality seems good.  Overall, pleased and hopeful we'll get some wear out of these...
B00MWCSFWY|5|I'm happy with my selection it fit perfectly.
B00RPOZYZA|2|The gloves are not warm ar all. Might as well not wear gloves at all. Should be sold just for looks.
B00VPT2AXK|5|The quality of the t-shirt is awesome! It's 100% cotton and super soft. The graphic itself is done in rich colors and stands out against the background. I've washed it and dried it 3 times and it still looks good. The graphic is showing no signs of fading or cracking. Not dryer drying it would probably give the graphic even more longevity though.
B00ABB3N7A|1|THE WAIST VERY SMALL AND NOT FLEXIBLE, I REALLY DONT KNOW HOW TO THIS GIRL CAN WEAR!
B006PHXUOU|5|I haven't used mine yet, but my wife likes how her credit cards fit into hers.  The only criticism is directed more to the US Gov't:  Medicare cards are too big fit!
B00ATQXD2M|4|very well made!!
B005XLTGRE|4|I like the wide waistband. Good thickness of fabric for the price.
B000WO1FAS|5|Daughter loved them. Fit well and lasted long. May order another pair soon. five stars!! Great for your kids. Thx
B000Q4VPR2|5|beautifull
B00AMKMJIO|3|Very cute.  Not roomy enough in the thigh area.  Even the P isn't much larger there.
B00AYI8Y38|4|I was so excited to see that there was a BG shirt, my 2-year-old love them so I ordered it right away. As others have said, the pictures don't look exactly like the characters, but my daughter knew who they were immediately so that's all that matters. As far as sizing, it does run a little big, but it's really fine. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.
B00HB1R1EY|5|Awesome jacket! Fits true to size, great quality material. I was nervous about the purchase because of the low price; however, the jacket has exceeded my expectations!
B00S312XG2|5|I wore this to a recent political event and received numerous compliments on it. The dress itself is made of flowing lightweight material and the belt can be taken off the dress if you want. This is the perfect dress for a cocktail party, a date, work, church or to take on vacation and its wash and wear and doesn't wrinkle!!! I paired it with gold earrings and open toe wedge sandals no necklace is required.
B00UKX128Q|5|Perfect
B00ARBSMYI|5|This is actually a really nice product. My mom ordered it for me and I got the XL. I would suggest getting the larger size because from other reviews the sizing seems to run small...but the XL was slightly loose and I would wear it even if I were a few sizes smaller. Of course this depends on your body type.
B000NZW3IY|5|I opened up it's shiny envelope to find a simple note:  \\"Feel the power!\\"  True indeed, was this little note!  The force of the 3W1M T-Shirt blew me out of my driver side seat and into oncoming traffic and THEN  something magical happened!  The Three Wolf Spirits came alive!  They circumvented traffic with their gastly howls and shiny, blood thirsty, white, teeth.  Definitely worth the money!
B00J2AHRWS|2|I like the material.  I am 5'4&#34; and it's way too long.  I ordered large size but It doesn't cover the front like showing in the picture.  I am returning it.
B00YQDN80Q|4|Its 2015, why do shirts still have tags? Shirt fits fine and is fruit of the loom, but I'd give it 5 stars if it were tagless.
B00D214KTG|5|Thumbs up
B002E5HF84|3|I was going to try learning how to make a hat with this pattern.  It is designed for people with more experience than I so now is gifted to a friend in the costuming profession.
B000QANUR4|4|Like the vest. The sizing is a bit off. I assume it as an Asian 3XL and not USA. It is more like an XL at best. Other than that, soft, and well made.
B008BMF662|2|i had to hem it and the material was too stiff, i wish i would of returned them, other than being too long and stiff the fit was great.
B00FLV54YU|3|I ordered the same pants in white size 12 and khaki (trail was the color name) exact same brand and style.<br />The white ones were 1/3 of the price of the khaki ones ($12.99) with tax and shpg total $21.49 and they were<br />too small. A few days later the khaki ones came from a different retailer...which were $34.99 plus tax & shpg<br />and they fit just right...So I am confused....Both were Dockers Soft Capri's.
B0002KQ2HI|5|These shoes are exquisite.  So very feminine and soft.  They exemplify what I search for in a classic style shoe that is timeless and graceful!!!
B00CJS9XCM|3|The large Martin t-shirt was a little larger than typical large sizes on me. I got a medium which fits fine. Cool shirt!
B00ET1V4ZQ|5|will order more
B00JBVTHKI|3|fits as expected, I am 5'8&#34; 150 lbs. w a booty and ordered the XL and it fit perfect with room to move
B00081A0VA|5|Whether you need a little help, or a lot of help, this product is amazing! It gives you that perfect hourglass figure!
B00A3U73Q6|5|This scarf was a big hit.  It's very stylish, elegant and oh so soft.  It looks like an expensive European designer brand name item.  Buy these up and give them as gifts!!<br />I will only add that the orange stripes are more salmon/coral color than shown.
B00L4FUGV8|3|The quality is okay. Other brands of this type of product are much nicer, softer, warmer but for $5 each, they are just fine.
B004K7WOT4|5|i thought it was a great, awesome shirt. i wore it everyday because it is literally the coolest shirt. then something weird stared happening. at first it was like growling in the middle of the night. at least i think it was growling. then all of a sudden the lion came out of the shirt. well not he whole lion. just the head. at first i was scared, but then i saw it rolling around. it was frankly quite pathetic. it was a great shirt, despite how pathetic the lion really was
B00EARGWEW|5|Works great!  I do not have to put on a hands-free pumping bra everytime I pump. I leave these  clipped onto my shirt and adjust the hole size it creates after clipping as shown in directions to fit my pumping funnels. Works good so I get good suction and can use it hands-free. Cheaper and more convenient than other hands-free pumping bras that you have to put on every time to pump.<br />Used on other pumping shirts and bras then the brand it says it works with. I think the price is fine because it's just as useful as a hands-free pumping bra but a fraction of the price. Sure it's just two clips but 10.00 is nothing compared to 40/50$
B00AKZO5JC|3|You get exactly what you pay for with this.
B00DHCXUMS|4|It is nice. Sexy. Not really for US, but if you traveling to regions that this type of swimming suit is common, then this is worth it. Quality seem good, but the material doesn't dry easily.
B00FO3AQNO|5|the color is a little different close up, and a lot thinner than the picture shows. However, I love it! it arrived within two weeks although the estimated delivery date was a month. I am contemplating buying another!
B00AG079IU|5|Bought as a gift. The recipient loved them. They were a great fit.
B0087FHP0S|5|I love the way this dress falls on me. Perfect fit and adjustable to fit different body types. Super flattering!
B00DZQ0JT8|5|Absolutely georgeous. We had numerous compliments last night when my daughter wore it at gymnastics. It is really nicer than it looks in the picture and very well made.  My daughter is taller (90%) and thinner (10%) than average and it fit her well, as I expected. She has room to grow. It would probably be to small for an  average size.
B00LDE1222|5|Love it..yellow is radiant on my little..amazing quality
B00BBS0EGA|5|exactly as described-  Great price
B00B93V4Y8|3|Got this for my wife in a size small.  She is 5'3 and 100lbs.  I decided to try a size small-US but for whatever reason, the Charcoal colored one seems to run a bit big.  Not overly big.  But not form flattering either.  You can sill make this work if you had a cute blazer and some knee high boots.  Just got to get creative.
B00R0UNMM6|5|Comfy and stylish - the perfect combo. This dress is nice enough to wear to work but casual enough to wear out to lunch. I have another dress by Donna Morgan and they both have the same comfy/stylish ration.
B007PQOKHQ|5|I just LOOOOVE THIS SHIRT!<br />I will used it for the premier of the new Dragon Ball Z Movie Fukkatsu no F!!! :3
B00J4QLCIK|5|Zelda fans this is pretty neat. Zelda green fits great even sizing  up to 3 x l. I will go back to this store ,prices were great and the had other shirts like metro is that looked cool.
B00B1VB6Z0|5|My husband loves the moisture wicking
B00A1WDWQ6|5|What a cute little hat.  I bought it for my son to wear next winter so it is a little big.  But great hat for the price!
B000VD92L4|5|good quality as usual for carhartts  but too expensive!
B00NKK1PNS|4|Very comfortable to workout
B00H2TTX9G|5|I have a short and stocky build and this shirt fit me just as expected.  I went to the gym wearing this shirt and people were impressed by the illusion of how fit I looked.  Very comfortable material.
B00422MCW6|5|Bust walls
B001V92YDU|5|Eagle shirts are the finest shirt you can buy without spending an arm and a leg. If you doubt this, look at the buttons which are well-constructed and have a slight indent. The back of the shirt has the trademark loop, only found on Eagle Shirts.
B004M95VM2|5|I absolutely love this tank.  It's super comfy and very cute.  The material is soft and stretchy, and has a loose fit without looking too big.  Fits true to size.  I also like it because I don't have to wear a bra with it, thanks to the double layers and loose fit of the top layer.  I liked this so much I got it in all four colors.
B001R4C99I|5|Kids can put socks on and not complain about the seams.  All the complaints are a thing of the past.  Great product, comfortable and exactly what we were looking for.
B008ESD5N4|5|They are comfortable and stylish. When you first wear them, they seem a little tight (I wear a size 9 and ordered large), but after a few minutes, they stretch to fit perfectly. They are decent quality. I have washed them and they held up well. I've since ordered three pairs in different colors.
B005CFVOFS|4|I normally wear a large in dreamgirl lingerie; this piece fits good in the chest but is a little large in the hips.
B00IBIPDSW|4|O líked
B00V7T8UKK|1|Item was see through because the under layer was half the length of the outer layer
B0062IEBN6|5|I love this sweater.  It's exactly what I wanted and the material is very soft ..
B000VV7G2I|5|Great hat. I like the lazer cut band. I got the natural color and may get the black one too.
B005OBENIU|5|fit/feel great
B00LFHS4JG|1|Either my boobs are in the wrong spot or theirs are.
B007C2IST4|5|these gowns are very handy nighttime attire for little ones, but they ride up the legs, which greatly reduces their coverage.  I think they might be better with the elastic (at the bottom) tighter -which I could probably do -but would be nice if the elastic was made tighter when they're being manufactured
B00EO4UAZS|5|Awesome shirt and 2 day shipping was great!!!
B004IYIMUE|3|I want to return it because i did not get it yet and i think it is small. But i do not get this and i want to refund.
B005NV50M4|5|My little girl loves this outfit and so does e/one else!!!! We get tons of compliments on it everywhere we go!  This outfit is much prettier than what the picture shows.  Its been in the wash several times now with a tumble dry and it still looks great!!
B00EHMZE6W|5|my granddaughter looks so cute in it & her daddy loves it !!
B00NIVAEG8|5|Love this hat!
B003H6DCCC|5|While I am about 15 pounds overweight, the Spanx allowed me to wear a tight fitting dress to a wedding. I received numerous positive comments. Yeah! I've since brought a second one so I always have one ready to wear. I also like the fact that this style tucks under my bra vs. one with shoulder straps.
B00OVZEZII|5|sort of cheap looking  but  it is very cute  i will wear it
B000H1G4KC|4|Minimizes any &#34;air conditioning&#34; issues.  Great support and not a bulky added push up.  The woman doing my fitting for a bridesmaid dress was even impressed
B008613J3U|5|Fun way to celebrate my favorite team while enjoying my favorite pastime-i only wish they were fitted, but they are comfortable and look great!
B00LW4RP1U|5|Great pjs !
B00JUM4IQQ|3|was nice experience
B00DZKXQ2Q|5|love this shirt!!! Fit perfect.
B001D1KST8|4|Hat is very sturdy and authentic in look. It's a little big for a 5 y/o but the adjustable strap at least allowed the hat to stay on.
B00NVELZ92|4|Very nice material.  Flattering but doesn't make your butt as revealed as most leggings
B00FIB17QC|5|I bought this as a gift for my younger sister who absolutely loves My Little Ponies. She hasn't taken it off since she got it. I bought it a size bigger just in case it shrank, bit it didn't shrink too much on hot, so it fits her a bit baggy, but that's not a problem for your average 6 year-old.
B0085J4K4U|5|I bought this lovely dress for a black tie event.  The fit is flattering fitting nicely but long, and it's very light in weight without wrinkles.  The soft gray and silver lace layer is cut at bottom but not hemmed, and I added a rolled hem.  If shortening, take to a very good tailor, as it makes a difference in how bottom falls.  Leave lace separate from other layers as it did not work out attaching gray tulle layer to lace.  Also, make sure the gray satin underslip is shorter than lace layer!  If I could do over I would have had it shortened the same as it arrived with no hem in lace but I would have applied the &#34;stop fabric unravel&#34; product which dries soft.  Price on Amazon is better than others.
B007LCZAV4|3|The shirt. Is of good quality .the shirt. Was heavier than I had expected and I will<br />Probably get a few more.
B00K2XOQXC|3|size runs small I should have ordered a full size larger than I normally wear
B0073LT5I2|5|I love this necklace even though I was expecting it to be bigger, but I still love it just as it is! Its not too small and not too big. I am very happy with my order and appreciate the extra battery that was sent with it. If you want a cheap, cute Alice in Wonderland necklace, I highly suggest this one. It arrived just as I expected and feels really durable and not cheap.
B0007NID22|2|I bought two 34D sized strapless bras on the same order. the size difference is amazing. I have an old 34C that fit better than this. Quality-wise it is really nice. My only problem was the size. I ended up with the Bali.This will be returned.
B00BY3MHWQ|5|These are just incredibly comfortable and easy to care for and are worth twice the price.<br />Practical notes:  the fit is easily adjusted with the ingenious ties on the pants and waist of the top.  Make them as tailored or as loose as you like.  They should be washed in cold water (Dark Woolite recommended) and hanger-dried.  No perceptible shrinkage occurs and no fading.  You can go from bed to patio in this ensemble and never give it a thought.
B00TUF95YI|5|Very great hat
B009FVA3SY|4|Ok
B00EVH4VNU|5|Sporty , comfy, simple yet in style for me ,,,,, if it's good for me it's good for you ,,,,,recommend this
B000VK5QM6|5|Pretty and lots of full-figure support. Great product.
B00IWJG6CC|5|soft
B00558NVPI|5|good
B00H3AR59E|5|Nice coat. Good quality at an inexpensive price.
B00QJC5CZG|1|Body fit but arms too tight.  Sent it back
B00JK8HSZ8|5|A little sheer but not too bad.
B00K2F8CA8|2|I purchased these shirts in white and black to wear under a short sleeve lab coat.  I am usually wear a 2X, sometimes 3X if the item runs smaller.  I ordered this in a 3X and while not uncomfortably tight, it is extremely form fitting.  Fortunately there is a a lot of give in the fabric.<br /><br />The material is so thin that while wearing the white, the sleeves appeared to have pink tint to them because my arms were slightly sunburned.  I am 5'9&#34; tall and the shirt covers my hips, but rides up with movement because it is so snug fitting.  I don't think I will be ordering this again.
B001FX3SA0|5|very comfortable good quality
B00HT2XMKW|5|Adorable. Great fit for my size 14-16 bottom. Very flirty. Very bright--I paired with a black top. Definitely low waisted but I had the tummy covering I needed. Maybe I'll wear this next year with a bikini top--wish me luck on that one

B002HJ377A|5|Immediately upon donning the three wolf moon shirt the embodied spirit of Charlemagne appeared and imparted upon me wisdom lost to the ages.    wicked
B0091QVZTY|2|These did not live up to Jones New York quality.  The fabric is so so, and there was a large gap at the waistline in back.  If I pulled them lower down on my hips, the gap lessened, but then the crotch was down on my thigh.  I returned them.
B00I8P9YXS|4|Definitely a special occasion/dinner dress.  It reads very authentic late 1950's.  Very pretty color and cut and I got several compliments.  The arm holes go a little low so you will have to be selective about what you wear under it.  A petticoat is a must.  I wore my moderate petticoat and was wishing for one of my fluffier ones.  It did come very crushed and wrinkled in a plastic bag, but that is to be assumed when you mail order something.  Some time with my clothes steamer took care of it.
B00170H1JK|4|I bought this jacket for a volunteer work trip in Costa Rica, during the rainy season there.  It was perfect for the heavy rains, but was a little warm!  Plus, I had bug spray and sunscreen on my arms, so the jacket stuck a little, but that's not the jacket's fault. :)  For the price, the jacket was great and well suited for the trip.  And, the sage/green color is great.
B004E08MFW|5|The product is really awesome, match all the expectations. It's made of quality material, a fantastic buy! I recommend for all
B006G7JZAM|5|Seems a little small, but they are really stretchy for a snug fit. My son wears a size 9c (toddler) shoe now.
B00HS8VEHU|3|So I was expecting more of a foam like padding however this shoe will contour to your feet.  It is a little hard at first to get used to but I noticed a difference in my step right away.  I am on my feet 9 hours at a time and these shoes do help with standing up for a long time.
B002BPN48C|5|My husband liked this dress.<br /> The colors just popped out for me while wearing this dress.<br /> Very soft and and comfortable.<br />I felt pretty in this dress.<br />The dress looks red here....<br />but I bought the blue dress in this style.<br />Perfect dress to wear while walking on the beach.<br />I am very happy with my purchase.
B000MQHIUC|5|Very comfortable
B00NVMU8HY|3|It was a very small coat. I read the dimensions and it just didn't work for me at all.
B00OUJTUF8|4|Very pretty and appropriate dress for performances
B00T5GHV0W|3|Color is great. It's extremely long though, if you are on the shorter side (I'm 4&#34;11) though I would recommend maybe sizing down (I got a medium). I planned on wearing it with shorts for summer but it's so long that i will probley only wear it in the fall with boots and leggings.
B004G7WALA|1|When I received these gloves, I thought they looked nice enough, but not great for the $20 price tag.  I wore them one day and they began unraveling in several places.  Ironically, I saw the same gloves being sold by a street vendor in NYC.  I asked him the price...$7.00!!  Not that they're even worth that.
B008X9ZDLG|2|Very small even though I ordered medium/large
B00JE644L2|3|I haven't washed it yet, but I'm doubtful that it will survive the wash. It's rather small, even after taking into consideration the size difference for Americans versus Asian sizing. I would say, if you follow the sizing information, just go up one size. Then, you will have a bargain.
B00JQEAZ1U|5|My daughter looks adorable in it. The colors are vivid and it is well-made. Another winner from Youngland.
B00HIILK8S|5|This is a really, REALLY cute jacket. Very flattering and the fit is perfect. It's warmish, but not too warm. I was looking for a sherpa, but this is just so great looking, I sent the softer warmer sherpa back.
B000BNKGHI|5|Very thin - exactly what I was looking for.  Can hold a number of cards (2 per slot and 4 or more in the center).
B00GGX3FF2|5|made a terrific anniversary gift for my husband... he will never have to look for a collar stay again...
B00Z70EYEG|5|loved it
B0007Z6FUC|4|i needed this for my brothers football game but i put the wrong shipping days. I ask the seller if i could cange it or cancle in. I did neather and my package came in the day i needing it, whick was 2 days after i ordered it. the only thing i don't like about is that it is pretty thin but other than that, its great!!
B00EEAYJGI|1|These are SUPER stretchy so the fit is actually quite good with the exception of the front crotch/lower zipper area.  It's a bit baggy as if it could hold a low pot belly which is weird on someone without such a groin tummy.  Regardless, I thought they were worth keeping.  For reference I bought the Size 2.  I'm 5'5\\", 25\\" waist, 34.5\\" hips, weigh 117, and am very athletically built.  My quads and calves are huge.<br /><br />However, I decided to wash them before wearing to get out the creases from shipping and storage and followed the label exactly.  Cold, inside out, gentle, separately, and then line dried (even through the label states they can be machine dried on low).  Well, when I turned the jeans back to outside out...much of the gold coating was gone!  There was large patches of almost plain blue jean material!  Horrible.<br /><br />Skip these.  They aren't worth the $20.  Seriously.
B00NL4TRME|3|Gets Runs easily
B00AEVVRX4|5|Good quality and eveywhere I went people commented on it. I wore it to work in a fast food restaurant on Christmas day and the customers we had loved it.
B003TJOE3I|4|product was as described
B000GIOEU8|3|It's a $8 shirt. Runs small, but probably fine for working out.
B00B2G411K|5|Great design with good qaulity. Well made down coat. Very sofisticated look. I love this coat, wearing it every day since i recived. TodaY was very cold day - 10 C. with a wind in Seoul but I was in this warm coat, didn't feel cold.
B00HEALAOE|5|This is the second Fleece Jacket ordered.  My husband has had the Free Country Micro Fleece Jacket in navy for over a year.  He liked it so well that we ordered it in black. His navy fleece has had a lot of wear and it still looks nice after many washings.
B000JLK2D0|1|I got these for my husband for Christmas.  He is very particular about how his clothes fit, especially thermals and tshirts.  I looked at the tags of some of his old thermals in his drawer to make sure I had the right brand and size.  Imagine my surprise when he tried these on and the arms were too short and wide, the neck was too high, and they weren't long enough.  I guess they changed the fit?  We ended up giving them to Goodwill as neither of us could wear them.  From now on I guess he will have to try things on at the store!
B002LFDWQQ|5|I am very pleased with this Jack Sparrow Scarf and Dreads I ordered from Amazon. I ordered it for my 4 year olds costume and he loves it! It is made so you can tighten/adjust the scarf to fit and everyone from my 4 yr old to my husband has played in it. It is a nice quality and the dreads are made well.
B002IFL1IU|5|Loved this costume.  I'm 5'1 107 lbs and the small fit great.  The gloves were a little big so bought some yellow knee high socks, cut off the foot and attached the red wings to the knee high part and wore them on my forearms. Worked great and added color. Being the dress is a little short, wore red bathingsuit bottoms over the tights.  It was the perfect female flash and very comfortable too.
B00AB2BSTY|5|Good value.
B00QO5APD2|5|Finally found my perfect size.  Love them.
B000V6X6I6|4|Ordered for a pirate-themed melodrama. Hat arrived in big box totally squashed in a corner under mounds of packaging material. It was easily re-shaped into correct form with a little patience. Did not come with any feathers which would have been preferred but it's a rather minor matter. The gold trim is a quite bit more noticeable than in the product picture but for our production that's a plus. Will probably shorten the ends of the bows as they hang down to nearly chin length and we don't want our actress distracted by wiggling red ribbon all night. :)  All in all a good quality costume hat at a very reasonable price.
B00FFX6A4W|5|Great gloves. My husband loves them. The leather is really soft. The cashmere is nice and warm. Quality is excellent. The black and brown leather combination makes them very practical.
B009EUIHWU|5|This product was exactly what I ordered which is good! It is exactly as advertised and I am very thoroughly pleased! Its thick and heavy though but I guess that is how its supposed to be because I love it that way!
B004R2CQ0E|5|This is a very good bra for the full figured person. I purchased one for my cousin and she continues to boasts about the great fit and comfort of this bra.
B00M2T6I7Q|4|no complaints from daughter which is a plus
B00E20GLVQ|5|Is a very well made cap, is a warm material very good for a cold weather, and it fits me very confortable.
B00ICSWSLQ|1|I would give it less stars if possible. The sweater was an adult small but would fit an 8 year old ~ it was a weird faded pink with several yellow-brown spots on the front of the sweater. The fabric is really stiff like it was soaked in some type of chemical and then allowed to dry out without being rinsed. Overall, the item is just gross....it was meant as a gift but that didn't happen, of course.
B00KAEZUY2|5|Although these shirts are Chinese made, they are of excellent quality and nearly as good as the U.S. made, Ruddock &#34;Flying R&#34; shirts. The snaps are quite good and hold fast - unlike most Chinese western shirts I've seen.  The sleeve length was perfect and overall fit was as expected.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to buy these shirts again and would absolutely recommend them to any prospective buyer.
B0078Z0TAQ|5|Love the garment!
B00EFX4SOM|5|i love it
B00MIPLLAS|3|If you buy this.. Buy EXTRA EXTRA large!!
B008VS8R30|4|Material is good, shirt is cute, it's mostly what I was expecting except I thought it would be a little bigger-- I got a small, but I had gotten the impression that it fit a little baggy.  Whatever, though-- it's cute and I like it a lot.
B004IYIMT0|4|These are definitely my new favorite pair of underwear. They are soooo much softer than any pair of cotton underwear I've worn before. I love them. The only thing is the inside legs of the trunks like to ride up and bunch up where I don't want them to
B00HX0CH7Y|3|Okay
B003949XCK|3|Holds about 4-5 cards or a 6-10 bills on each side.  Only annoying part is that there are two straps holding them in so it is hard to pull out the cards.  I took out one of the straps on the card side and it works okay but I used to have a wallet like this with one strap down the middle that I liked much better.
B004H0M9PI|4|I was looking for a slim fitting navy blazer for my 9 year old son for a church ceremony and was nervous to order one online.  After much research and comparing I decided to go with the Ike Behar in a size 12.  My son is a tall (57 in) soon to be 10 year old with a slim frame.  The 12 fit him perfectly!  The blazer is beautiful with very nice detail, especially the stitch detail around the collar and lapel.  It's nicely lined,too.  I was glad to have paid slightly more than I wanted to for a blazer.  If you're looking for a jacket with a more slim, european fit then Ike Behar boy blazer is the way to go!
B004CJ2RHO|5|I thought these might be crappy little socks. They're actually really nice. I wish they made some for adults. They're kind of stretchy and super easy to put on little feet. Highly recommended.
B00IKTXYE2|5|It's a nice wallet for men, I saw it and suddenly I purchased it, isn't big like the others.
B00NL4CM12|4|Perfect! They are so cozy and it arrived early! But just one thing. There's already a hole tearing at the souls of the tights. Although that's probably my bad luck with socks and such. Still a good product though.
B00JF3LHMI|5|Purchased for newborn nephew. Very good buy.
B000GPCBZG|3|I think the name changed after I added it to my cart because I thought I was getting all of the colors pictured. I would have gone with a different color or a cheaper item if I had noticed it was just a plain black skinny tie.
B008Y5MJU2|5|I bought this item in purple and I love it.  It is very soft and goes with everything.  It is a long sweater and it hangs just below my hips, but the sizing seems a little on the larger size.  You might want to consider a size smaller for a better fit.  I do wash and dry it in the dryer to make sure the sweater is a little tighter on the knit.  I love it!
B012ADYUHI|5|The fabric was really nice and it was well made and a beautiful color.  It ran quite big.  I ordered the Medium because of the measurements on their sizing chart, though I usually wear a 6 or 8 and I was afraid the small was too little.  I had to send it back because it was so big.  I was planning to reorder and buy the small as soon as I received the credit, but in the two days it took to mail it back the price has gone from $26.00 to $34.99!  I like so many dresses, that I may go with something else now because I just wanted to make a clean exchange.
B001C4RSWG|1|Feathers are very loose
B003NX8CME|5|Love this Jacket so I ordered in several colors.  Warm and light.
B004XGFVRO|5|arrived quickly (within 4 days of purchase during the week before xmas!)and packaged nicely! definitely buying in the future c:
B00NXLN8EI|1|Too, too small.  Cute, but small.  Very disappointed.
B001FOR3HI|4|good
B00GEKTUJM|1|Not only does this slinky thing cling to every unsightly curve/bulg/dimple/cellulite/saddlebag (whatever you have got), it is completely see through!  Yuck!
B004SE20OS|1|NEON colors - great if you plan to go hunting or work road construction in your underware- no other safety colored clothing needed!
B00FP0MHYW|5|Perfect thanks a lot
B00822DBU4|5|Bought it for a first communion dress which was see-through.  This worked perfect!
B00SLG5YYM|5|Excellent!
B00NHN214K|5|Excellent
B00KC47ENK|5|Very pleased with the dress and it fit perfectly.  It was great for Hawaii but I'm sure I will get a lot of good out of it in the future.  Fast shipment!
B001FC44UO|5|These are wonderful! In flats, just a tad too long, but quick fix is just to cuff. So glad I gave them a try.
B00N6S2C68|2|A great shirt but the material is thin. It is more like a T-shirt than a polo. I would not purchase this shirt again.
B007X4DF3K|5|Ed Garments delivers on quality!  Great shipping too!
B00ARDOUYM|5|Nice looking shorts that my son basically lives in. Good for his middle school uniform. Easy care, no ironing needed.
B00I9TD0II|1|This isn't the the dress I received. I got a solid orange dress. Not happy.
B00NYFXKJQ|5|The fit is perfect. Second pair for my husband 😄
B00DHAJC9A|1|Material is not good quality
B000RWG2BM|4|These liners are great for those flat shoes that are low-cut around the sides. The heel grip keeps them in place and is comfortable. I would recommend this product.
B00GSVSUDE|5|I had a pair of this style ear muffs when I was younger and have been looking for a similar item for a long time. I bought 2 sets so I can send one to my sister. They are exactly what I wanted and am very pleased.
B0007LNZM2|2|I really did like my keychain.  I used to clip it to my belt loop, and put keys in back pocket of pants.  I had been doing this for years.<br />While attending a baseball game at Fenway Park ( I live a couple hours away) the clip portion broke, or rather one portion fell off, leaving my keys barely hanging out of back pocket.  I was fortunate to feel the extra weight in my back pocket, it would have been a heck of a bad night if I lost my keys in Boston!<br /><br />The leather is beautiful, and I thought it was a very high quality piece, I wish I could just replace the clip, but the leather is riveted together.
B00QQ8TN9E|5|It was what I expected. I am so happy with my short. I will recommend it to anyone. Thanks.
B008BV7KEE|5|For the price is totally worth. Does the trick.
B00G464WVM|5|Fits just right
B007W67N7S|4|I like this vest.  Good value for the price.  The vest fits large across my bosom but I like the fit else where.  I am a plus size woman with an ample bosom and I feel it was to large in the chest area.  Even with fit I feel it was a good buy.
B00HWF8F80|3|The picture is a farce.  It's blasphemous even.  What I had thought would be a nice mellow yellow colored sports bra turned out to be and electric-neon-greenish-yellowish color.  Buyers beware and take note.
B00K6HXPWC|4|good quality tee but a bit large
B002OXUSYO|5|Perfect find for my Anna costume
B006IUXPM6|5|Great service and product. The items arrived on time, and were in the condition depicted at the site. I took a chance and bought two pair because this seemed like a nice item at a fair price. I am happy with this purchase.
B00D2GHXZ4|5|Beautiful shirt, comfortable as well
B00274LPT2|5|Nice large brim, as others have said, it is packable if you are careful.
B008FT7BLY|5|I like the color, the look, the quality, and the fit but I would have preferred the blue one. Unfortunately, amazon did not have it. I bought it because of the low price. RG website has the blue but one has to pay the full price.
B004EIIKYC|5|My fault had to send back for a bigger size
B00M30IGBK|5|Great quality
B00D3REUG2|5|I sent these to my son for my grandson in Guatemala.  They need something not too warm, that will keep mosquitos off the baby while he is sleeping.  They love these pajamas.
B00D5VN1XE|5|I like this item
B00HNB1NT6|5|The solid color shirts run a little big, I initially ordered a medium and returned for a small which fits perfect. Very easy return process that I was highly satisfied with. Thanks!
