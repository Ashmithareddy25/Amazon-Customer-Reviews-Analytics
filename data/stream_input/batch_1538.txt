B007SGM084|1.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy bundle was mindless reading at its best!  The plot was predictable and the author went to great lengths to practice her ability to describe kinky intimacy.  Take out the paragraphs devoted to sexual acts, and there would be no trilogy--just a 1-book formula romance novel.  I read the trilogy while on vacation and it was a good way to pass the time on a long flight.  Finishing the book was a relief.

0345803485|1.0|This book does not present some harmless fantasizing that lives only within these pages: It has real world ramifications. Art influences life. And imagine how the behaviors of men in our society could change for the worse if they grow to believe that this kind of abuse and domination is what all women want out of their sexual relationships. Imagine how that could influence the way a man treats a partner who feels too afraid and has too little self-esteem to firmly say \\"No.\\" when they feel uncomfortable. Imagine how that could influence the behavior of a man who sees a woman walking down a dark street alone. Imagine how it could influence a society that is already infested with horrendous and despicable acts of sexual brutality directed almost exclusively at women. Imagine it.    And shouldn't we teach the women in our society, especially young women, that they deserve to love themselves and respect themselves so much that they should never want to be treated in such a horrific way? that they should never want anyone to dominate them? (Ana is beaten, after all; BEATEN. You know what I call violence mixed with sex: I call it RAPE. And the author seems to feel that because these are two consenting adults that somehow that makes it acceptable. It doesn't! And quite honestly, something isn't consensual if it's coerced.) And shouldn't we teach the men in our society, especially young men, that they deserve to love and respect themselves so much that they should never feel the need to dominate or abuse another person. This book sends a horrible message to our young people.    This book is not about sexual fantasy, it's about rape, and sadly the author seems to condone it and promote it.    Bud Glory    [...]
0385737947|4.0|The Maze Runner thrives on the suspense and the fantastical setting. Just like Thomas, the protagonist, we are thrown into the Glade being just as (if not more) confused as him. The technology, the creatures, the absurdity of the situation was like a video game as we follow Thomas on his journey to solving it. The pace was fine, Dashner knows how to keep my attention with action. But one of the biggest issues are the characters: especially Thomas, who despite his bravery doesn't seem like a smart guy; he only \\"solves\\" the whole thing by relying on past memories. However, The Maze Runner is comprised with many surprising elements that draw me into the story, keeping me reading to find out how the pieces fit together. An exciting (even if dark) story of a group of teenagers trying to solve their way out of a dire situation.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Thomas wakes up in an elevator and is led to The Glade, a town of only boys surrounded by a Maze. There are also monsters that lurk the Maze at night, so that nobody is allowed out of The Glade after the walls close. Every week, supplies are sent from the elevator, and every month a new boy is sent. There are different jobs: farmers, cooks, police officers, janitors, etc. And then there are the Runners, a group of elite Gladers sent to run in the maze everyday to find an exit. The Maze changes everyday, and for two years, an exit hasn't been found. Thomas feels strongly tied to being a Runner, but before think about it-a girl comes up in the elevator.<br /><br />Language:<br />The Gladers have their own slang, which I suspect might be a way to bypass swearing for a novel targeted towards young teens. The abundance of strange words bogs down the story a bit and leaves me in complete confusion in the first chapter. The slang could have been used a bit less so the reader has a stronger grasp of what's going on. If anything, it sounded like the boys were using the slang to intimidate people. Gradually we begin to know what words stand for and it becomes less of a distraction. However, I am not sure why they start creating slang that makes them sound like cavemen even though they all know English. If you are fine with the slang in Moira Young's Blood Red Road, The Maze Runner's language won't faze you.<br /><br />Dark:<br />There's no gore, but there are a LOT of deaths. Thankfully, their deaths usually don't arise from unnecessary fighting. The Gladers generally know they have to work together, and killing one of their own is just not helping the situation.<br /><br />Characters:<br />I am confused as to why The Maze Runner is written in third person limited instead of first person. Obviously we can't have such a suspenseful story in third person omniscient: there wouldn't be any secrets if the narrator is supposed to know everything. We only get follow Thomas and knows what he knows, but the third person stance leaves me unable to understand Thomas. I want to know what is going inside his head. Because of the narrator, the other characters, although many of them likable, don't get enough depth.<br /><br />Thomas: Protagonist and one of the reasons why The Maze Runner has a slow start: it's because he SO CONFUSED, with so many questions. HOLD YOUR HORSES AND WAIT FOR THEM TO EXPLAIN, DUDE! Makes me want to yell at him to stop interrupting the story with his questions. He is like the annoying kid in class that doesn't know when to shut up. I know why his peers ignore him half the time now. It just might be a guy thing, or a sign of his natural curiosity. I applaud his bravery, his intelligence, but I expected more to solving everything than just remembering stuff. A bit of a let down to be honest. Despite his talkative, curious nature, his determined demeanor makes him a good leader--and one of his best traits.<br /><br />Teresa: Maybe my head was in the gutter, but one girl amongst like forty guys...wouldn't you be expecting them to procreate? Anyway, she still remains pretty much a mystery.I want to like her, but I don't know her. Thomas and Teresa share a connection, but whether it's romantic or not, I don't know.<br /><br />Minho: A supporting character and the Keeper of the Maze Runners. He is also my favorite character (maybe it's because he is Asian? I love supporting minorities.) Unlike Thomas, he is less optimistic, but a strong leader nonetheless.<br /><br />Newt: Despite the ridiculous nickname, he is a charismatic leader. He is more calmer one in the group. I definitely like him more than Thomas as well.<br /><br />Grievers:<br />The \\"monsters\\" that make the Maze so scary. When they were first introduced I thought they were like gigantic buffalos (since they were ramming windows)...but it turns up they are just six feet long, mechanized, ugly slugs. Actually now that I imagine it, they seem ridiculous. I rather have a buffalo. They can kill, and sometimes sting to give someone flashbacks. I am puzzled with the flashbacks for they seem to be an intentional product of the Grievers. If it was intentional, they wouldn't be built with those needles in the first place, right? But if the needles were intentional, then why brainwash everyone? But if the flashback needles were un-intentional, why create the needles and stick them in the Grievers?<br /><br />Ending:<br />GIVE ME MY ANSWERS! I'm feeling a bit cheated right now (even though I know it's a strategy to get me to continue the series.) The Maze Runner gives me these half-answers that don't quite tell me why people would waste so much time and money on such a elaborate maze. Do people have nothing better to do? SPOILER ALERT: So you waste two years conducting this thing when you could just gather them all to work together? Aren't more brains better than a few traumatized ones? (or worse yet, the murderous ones?)<br /><br />Overall, I did like the suspense, the world-building. But I am disappointed that my curiosity wasn't quenched: the answers given just left me with even more questions. I hope I will get some logical answers in the sequel, and all this stuff isn't just introduced for the heck of it.I want to like her, but I don't know her.

034580404X|5.0|So far a great read - reading the second book now. Can't seem to put the books down, but don't want to finish them too quick!
0375842209|5.0|Full review at: [...]<br /><br />What's happening: When we meet Liesel Meminger she is just a scant of a girl, fearful of everything and everyone around her. Her mother is taking her to live with foster parents and her brother has just died. At his funeral she sees a book lying on the ground near his grave and her instinct is to take it before someone notices her. Which she does. She can't read it but it comforts her since her brother no longer can and with her mother about to give her away it's the only thing she has and she holds onto it tightly. This book is the start of many things to come, some great, some devastating, but it starts the relationship with Hans Hubberman who starts teaching her to read in the middle of the night. It is those words that keep her going, even when she's starving. And it's the life of those words that keep her stealing book after book in the midst of war and death.<br /><br />Speaking of Death, this story is narrated by him. We're learning the life of a little girl through his eyes and through her eyes the life of a town. Some of her neighbors are fearful of not being German enough and some who would put their life on the line, quite literally in some cases, for any human being even a Jew. As life gets harder and harder people get desperate and you can see the desperation as the characters move, but there are also some times when life is still beautiful and they remember that in snippets and seeing this Death realizes that not all humans are horrible.<br /><br />A child knows the difference between right and wrong without even being told, even though she is stealing with her buddy Rudy. Liesel starts stealing for her soul but soon she and Rudy steal to feed their stomachs but somewhere Liesel realizes the books she steals are so much more important even than food and that drives her every day through so many harsh circumstances. Her Papa helps her to live a happy life, as much as they can on their meager existence and even when a Jew shows up at their door they all know they can not turn him away.<br /><br />Liesel learning to read and then reading to others is the soul of this books. She brings love and life in the most horrible conditions and helps to keep everyone around her brave and strong. The books she reads are the breath of life and the letters keep everyone's blood pumping for another day.<br /><br />Their struggles are serious and a young girl should never see and feel so much pain. No one should. But even Death realizes early on that the pain is what keeps Liesel moving forward, it keeps her reading, even keeps her sane at times and helps her to realize that even when a world is obeying one guy, that doesn't mean she has to. It's the words that bring her comfort.<br /><br />My thoughts: Firstly, the Goodreads synopsis above does NOT do this book justice. It's an amazing story of survival in a world that has been turned, quite literally upside down. When I was telling my husband about this book and laughing that I was reading yet another Dystopian for the year (apparently that's my thing lately) he asked why I thought this book was Dystopian. It's set in WW2, yes in Germany but in a town and under a roof where Liesel and her family are starving. Her Papa, Hans Hubbermann didn't support Hitler when he first come onto the scene and because of that many shun him and he loses job after job. They scrape by with scraps of food, barely living in a town with little light in everyone's souls. They struggle every day and yet still in the wake of horror they wake up with smiles because they still have one another.<br /><br />This small town lives through so many lessons. Liesel isn't the only one that has to learn about Death. Her neighbors and friends are not left untouched by the forces around them but it's what Liesel learns through this experience that makes this book such a great read.<br /><br />I read every chapter's title and felt as if I was reading The Never Ending Story. I looked upand said the chapter title (of which I don't want to give away even though at this point it would mean nothing to you) and pulled the book closer as I snuggled deeper into my chair, getting that little bit more comfy and finished the last 100 pages. I was so deep into this book that my husband would talk to me and I could barely wave my hand at him letting him know that I didn't have time, I must read! Must finish this fantastic book, and now I'm so sad that I did. Sad and I feel wonderful at the same time.<br /><br />I ended this book with tears streaming down my face. It was horrible and wonderful, intense and extremely well written. It was like looking at the sunset directly, seeing it in it's full beauty while it burns out your eyes.  I already miss the characters. I am a new fan of Markus Zusak!ven though at this point it would mean nothing to you) and pulled the book closer as I snuggled deeper into my chair, getting that little bit more comfy and finished the last 100 pages.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I love movies but this movie was awful.  1) You have to be able to stomach over 150 F-bombs, plus multiple other signs of a limited vocabulary.  The trailer was prepared to misdirect the potential audience.  I watched the entire movie including the short post-credit scene;  still very disappointed.  Don't rent it; Don't buy it.
0439023513|4.0|[...]<br /><br />What's Happening:<br /><br />Katniss is the face of the rebellion, whether she likes it or not. She strives to be who they want her to be instead of just letting herself be herself. Instead of seeing the strong, amazing person that she is she sees someone that is failing everyone but especially Peeta. She wants to get to him but doesn't know how. She wants to do something, anything but is stuck once again inside four walls and feels as if she's going crazy. On top of that the pressure to be the face of the rebellion is mounting, even with her team to help her transform into the Katniss she was during the interviews, she's still failing. She needs help but doesn't know where to turn to get it, she doesn't trust anybody to do what really needs to be done, but she doesn't want to lead either.<br /><br />She, her friends and her family have already been through and seen so much but it's going to get worse before it gets better.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br /><br />Oh my, oh my... where to start!? The beginning of Mockingjay makes you feel like Katniss has just jumped out of the frying pan and now she is in the fire. The explanation to what happened in Catching Fire is starting to come out but the more she understands the more she distrusts everyone around her. They want her to be THE girl with the face that leads people against the Capitol and all she wants to do is be free, to hunt. For her family to be able to live. There is so much that she has to learn still and this book doesn't give her time to think before throwing her into one horrible incident after another, but that's where Katniss reigns. She's great in the face of adversity.<br /><br />Without giving anything away I must say I didn't see the end of this coming. It was fabulous! Definitely a must read, even if you may have thought that Catching Fire was a little slower than the first, get through the series, it's so worth your time!
0316017922|5.0|This book is written in such a manner that makes it an unbelievably easy read. It lets the reader learn the concept of what makes successful people, well, successful. It goes step by step explaining the importance of circumstance and luck (yes, luck!) as key role players in the lives of people who achieve (or don't) the kind of success that we normally attribute to just hard work and ingenuity. It's not that these people aren't smart or special, they are, but after reading this book you will understand that those aren't the only key factors to their success, instead it actually is just a small part. This also helps the reader realize that to become successful there are barriers we have to overcome beyond our own personal shortcomings, that we have to work to overcome invisible barriers imposed on us by years and centuries of traditions and culture.<br /><br />If what I'm writing sounds a little off or crazy, I know how you feel. That's how I felt before reading this book, however after reading it everything makes perfect sense. Now I know that it takes even more work to be successful, but I can't help but feel that my eyes are more open, that I am completely aware now of what I need to do and what obstacles I need to overcome... and what opportunities I need to take advantage of for that matter.<br /><br />If you like to read business books, entrepreneurship books, start-up articles or books, or even if you just like to learn about human nature, do yourself a favor and read this one, you won't regret it.
0060855924|3.0|Full review at: [...]<br />What's happening?<br /><br />The first of the Discworld novels, introduces the grand world in which the disc is carried. We also meet Rincewind, a wizard who has dreamed of being a wizard his entire life but it's not all it's cracked up to be. We meet the anthropomorphic personification of Death, Twoflower and the Luggage as well as a full cast of other great people that we begin to love throughout the Discworld Series.<br /><br />Rincewind is a wizard, he even has Wizzard spelled on his hat. But he has issues, many issues. One of them is making sure he stays alive at all costs but since he met Rincewind as illustrated by Paul Kidby in The ...Twoflower and the Luggage it's gotten a bit difficult. First Rincewind's eyes go all shiney when he sees the amount of gold that Twoflower has brought over with him. Rincewind chokes while trying to tell Twoflower that, sure, of course that's plenty of money, so Twoflower assuming that he has offended Rincewind decides to give him even more money just so Rincewind can show him the sites of Ankh Morpork.<br /><br />What's funny is these two get to see a lot more than they ever bargained for, all the while Twoflower is absolutely loving life while Rincewind is cursing the day he laid his eyes on all of that gold. The journey is epic and will take them to the edge of the Discworld and beyond!<br /><br />My thoughts:<br /><br />Want more Terry Pratchett? List of Discworld Novels in multiple orders of recommended reading. As uproariously funny as this can be, I don't think it's Terry Pratchett's best. My favorite series is with Sam Vimes, I have a Guards, Guards book review that you can check out and if you like that you'll love the rest of the Night Watch Series. Besides, who doesn't love Sam Vimes?  I think that is a great one to go with if you're just starting.<br /><br />This is however a great start to the wonderful Discworld series and as I said above the characters that are introduced you will love to see in many books to come! I'm actually sad that we haven't seen a Rincewind novel in a while but I also need to reread the entire series so I may have missed where he ended up, or landed as he is always in the air.we haven't seen a Rincewind novel in a while but I also need to reread the entire series so I may have missed where he ended up, or landed as he is always in the air.

B0083VE37Y|4.0|I love Kylie so I'm giving this 4 stars. And it IS a great single disc collection of her 25 years of hits.  However, it would've been better if she'd included her new single Timebomb.  And if these songs were voted on by her fans, i find it hard to believe the fans selected Tears on my Pillow over Hand on Your Heart or Wouldn't Change a Thing.  Tears on my Pillow really doesn't fit in with the rest of the album's tracks and isn't considered a Kylie staple, since she never performs it.  The same can be said for Give me Just a Little More Time.  Finer Feelings could've been chosen, or perhaps a fan favorite from the Impossible Princess album.  But those 2 tracks can be easily skipped and you still have 19 songs.  Great introduction to Kylie.

B000002LND|5.0|Everybody should own a copy of this CD- even if your not a fan, believe me you will discover some songs on this LP you love. Most, but not all, of Madonna's biggest hits are included on this CD. From Holiday to Justify my Love & Rescue Me, all remastered in glorious Q-sound, and all in chronological order! The first and the best Madonna Greatest Hits CD! The only downside, and they are minor, is the terrible dance remix of Like A Prayer-it kills what was a beautiful song and the fact that around 7 singles are overlooked-however this is due to the fact that they would not fit onto one CD.  This misstep is easily forgiven because the songs that make the album really are her best songs and they are timeless classics- which is more than I can say for some of her more recent material. Madonna owned 83-1990 and this album perfectly captures this era, when she was at the top of her game.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|Enjoyed the variety of the upbeat tempo to the slower songs, which accent Adams beautiful voice range. there is something for everyone. Great CD, (and I usually listen to country).
B001QXZ81G|5.0|One of my 'Top Ten' movies of all time! Superbly simple, tastefully served to an easy viewing audience. Crack the whip and call 'EEE ARRR' to the movie that leaves you feeling good.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Before all the media hype, Fifty Shades of Grey was recommended to me by an 86 year old lady (?). I snuggled down with my kindle and started to read it.  After  a few dozen pages I assumed I had purchased the wrong book; certainly not what a sweet conservative granny-type would  recommended I thought.  I checked - wrong. I had the right book and sweet little old lady informed me the second book in the trilogy was even better!  Eh!! Well I have since read that the novel is definitely intended for the more mature, experienced age groups,  Obviously I don't fit that category.  I'm not a prude by any means and enjoy a bit of hot sexual action in any novel but the book is poorly written, explicit sadomasochist rubbish and oh sooooo boring.  Still haven't finished the book but in fairness to the author (being charitable here because I don't know if there is a word for porn writer other than now very rich bored housewife) and forced by my inner goddess, I will eventually. The tactic being - Six pages a week -like as a  kid cutting up pumpkin I hated - dice into small pieces, swallow it quickly like a pill and wash it down with a glass of water!  Take the raunchy porn out and all you have is a badly written very weak tediously dull story-line.  If you are not after intellectual stimulation, give it a go.  You might be a trendy after-all.[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]

0143119680|5.0|I don't understand why people have given this the reviews that it has so far. First off, the woman who wrote this, excuse me, the brilliant doctor and scholar who wrote this, is just that. She is a teacher and a genius. I thought this book was an extreme pleasure to read. I love intellectual books as well as fiction, so I very much enjoyed the historical, alchemical, and other knowledge the author had to offer. It was actually a challenge for my brain to keep up with some of the concepts, which is nice!<br /><br />Summary: A Discovery of Witches is about, of all things, a Dr. (female) who has extensive knowledge about alchemical manuscripts. When she tries to recall one in the Oxford libary that she has been working on, it won't come back. But this is no ordinary tome, this ancient volume has a secret, one in which our Dr. will be finding out very soon is entwined with her own fate.<br /><br />Harkness' writing kind of reminds me of how Dan Brown weaves a story. Of course they write in two totally different genres but they are both geniuses with what they write. They know a lot of things about a lot of things, but still have their own field of primary study as well. In this book, Harkness opens up a whole world of mystery, intrigue, and of all things, science!<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a great book. It is not intended for some 12 year old, however. The material can be dense and somewhat hard to understand, but it is worth it folks. Invest in the book!
B007VTVGFQ|3.0|Stripped down, jazzy, and leaving the impression the whole thing was designed to sound like it was improvised on the fly, Fiona's long-awaited new effort pleases but doesn't excel.  The lyrical theme largely seems to revolve around a frustrated woman who is craving more attention in her relationship.  The music it's laid over makes an almost sound-effect suitable soundtrack for it.  Nothing bad here, but nothing great or even memorable either.  You can't exactly hum along to this.<br /><br />Probably sounds good as background music in a coffee shop.  Not so much for car tunes.
0307592731|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but not the author. In some ways I felt she only hiked the PCT because she was ready to die herself. She went into the hike unprepared and with nothing to lose. I kept waiting for the great enlightenment to come upon her, but it never really came. Sadly, she never seemed to understand that she was in pieces long before the death of her mother. It truly was heartbreaking. Many people have lost those they love and have not given up on life, family, or themselves like she did. I can't say I liked Cheryl, I know I didn't. However, I completely understand why she fell apart. Wherever Paul is, I hope he put that chapter of his life behind him and stopped trying to save her from herself.<br />The book is well written, but don't expect to love this woman.

Watching this is a perfect example of the vibe that's lost in translation from live show to video.<br /><br />You'll see the beautiful stage.  The beautiful lighting.  The beautiful outfits.  The crystal clear music.  It's all there.  In 2.0 PCM or 5.1 DTS-HDMA.<br /><br />What's not there is the passion of the audience, and half the fun of going to a Duran Duran show is experiencing the fanatic women screaming, singing along, and dancing.  The audience is FAR too muted here.<br /><br />That's not a problem limited to this release...it's true of most live releases by any band.  But in Duran Duran's case especially, it mutes a major aspect of their shows.<br /><br />Let the audience be seen and heard more, even if it means the overall presentation is less...perfect.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was a well written story and definitely worth reading. I would recommend this for anyone who likes post-apocalyptic fiction.
0780020693|5.0|You have to love Felini to love his movies.  Very original and somewhat going into the bizarre.  I bought this for our monthly Wacky Movie Night with friends, so it was a gamble since everyone has different tastes in movies.  But it was a success.  Everyone enjoyed it and thought it was a perfect movie to watch. So Artsy!!!
B00006EXDM|5.0|This is truly a great album.  Two disks, too.  Highly recommend this album to any Rolling Stones fans out there.  Arrived in great shape from the seller.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|most of the games are fun but some are really hard and you have to beat them to get the next game
1455518999|2.0|I hate starting a book and not finishing it. Especially when there are questions I want answered. All of the Lee Child comparisons in these reviews are on the money! Jack Reacher is so much more interesting than John Puller. Here's the thing...I'm only on page 83 and don't know whether to finish this. The characters are cardboard, and the plot is soooo slow. I do want to find out who killed that family and why, however, I don't have the patience to plod through this so I think I'll just skim it. I love DB books and have read about seven of them which were amazing. Right now I'd rather read my People Magazine and find out the scoop on Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, and whether Suri is going to go to Scientology school. Nice try DB, but this one didn't cut it for me.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was the 2nd Picoult book that I read (1st-19 Mins) and this book hooked me to read almost every book she has written. She is a great writer and puts her all into her work!<br /><br />All of her books have tough topics, but I think she covers them in a respectful way and gives the reader insight to issues that other people dont see or even know exist!

B005LLSZNM|5.0|An intriguing series!  The first three seasons are free with Amazon Prime but I had to purchase the fourth season...couldn't wait!  I'm looking forward to the next season!
B007RX32XK|4.0|UK-based Alt-J make a compelling case for themselves with their first LP. Electronic twinges with dashes of world music and jazz added to a solid base of Maps-&-Atlases style indie rock keep each song interesting. Lyrics are littered with historical, literary, and film references to reward careful listeners, and vocalist Gwil's unique style of singing adds another dimension to the music, moving from monk chorale to childish warble to everything in-between. Alt-J is probably a love-them-or-hate-them band, but I'm definitely in the former camp, and I can't wait to see what they do next.
1416955070|3.0|I am only giving City of Bones 3 stars... OK maybe 3.5 stars because Ms. Clare failed to draw me into the story until more than half way through.  I had to keep asking my daughter if it was worth me continuing to read. She assured me it was, so on I went and I am glad.<br />The last third of the book was definitely a page turner up to the Epilogue, which I thought was a complete downer after what had just happened. (Trying hard for a no spoilers write up here.)<br /><br />I enjoyed the references to Star Wars and I am wondering if they are a foreshadow of what is to come in the next books.<br /><br />One big thing that kept creeping into my mind is the age of Clary... it just seemed to me that fifteen was too young an age. I don't know, I guess to keep Jace seventeen Ms. Clare had to make Clary fifteen, turning sixteen.<br /><br />All while reading City of Bones I couldn't help but be reminded of the Watch Series by Russian writer Sergei Lukyanenko-- of which I have read the first two Night Watch &  Day Watch. Both The Mortal Instruments &  The Watch Series contained all the fantasy characters; vampires, werewolves, wizards, etc.. and those humans, the special ones who were able to see them walking amongst us and fought to keep them inline.<br /><br />The twist at the end of the book left me really upset and I can only hope that the next book City of Ashes will twist it back. (Hey, it can happen.)<br /><br />Ultimately, although slow to deliver, City of Bones managed to draw me in enough to read the next in the series.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is cool fun its the game I ever play you guy should. check it out It the best game in the. world. j just love this game

B0052RE4MQ|3.0|The first novel, Matched, was so compelling.  I have been skimming this book for about a week and it is hard to stick with it.  The ending is predictable, with one  of two obvious options. If I can get through it, I hope to be surprised, but not expecting it.
B006R1T40I|4.0|Bonnie Raitt sounds good and sounds like herself on this album.  If you're looking for her to engage in new styles or rhythms that make you go \\"hmm\\" this doesn't do it.  If you're looking for your classic Bonnie Raitt blues-type sound, this album does the trick.  Good releases, easy to listen to, enjoyable music...nothing new that really blew me away though.  (Road-Tested is still my fave)
0439023521|5.0|I could not put this book down!  What a dynamic story!  I was hooked by page 3!  I saw the movie after I read the book.  The movie did not hold a candle to the vigor and intensity of the book.  It is a must read.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I bought this c.d. as a Father's Day gift for my Dad.  He has played guitar for almost 45 years now and embraces styles from Brad Paisley to Eric Clapton, from Stevie Ray Vaughn to Jeff Beck.  Good guitar playing is good guitar playing.  Needless to say, after listening to some of the songs on this c.d., I thought it would be a great buy, and I wasn't disappointed.  He LOVES it.  The songs have a great blend of sound and showcase blues/rock style.  If you're looking for nice musicianship, songs that you want to hear again and again, and something to entertain, you can't go wrong.
B007SGM084|4.0|Page turner, did not want to put it down.  Always something happening, HOT HOT HOT.. Had to step away from it... Shared it with my daughter. Very interesting, exciting, Awesome ending. Many of my friends read the book.  Would definately recommend it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love this series.  It has so many characters and plot lines that are intertwined.  It has been the only book to hold my interest after recently finishing 3 seperate series.  I love the 4 book format.  It is easy to go right on through once you finish.  I am looking forward to the books to come.

0345803485|1.0|After hearing so much hype about this trilogy my curiosity got the best of me....  I can't even finish the first book and I know for sure that books two and three will not find their way onto my bookshelf.  All that this character does is \\"BLUSH\\", or should I say \\"FLUSH\\", yes, as in what you do to a toilet, which is a fitting place for this book !!!!!  I hate this character and her inner Goddess, and I hate that I have to give this book even one star.  Can't wait for the movie !!!!!!!  and yes that is sarcasm.......OH MY !!!
0345803485|5.0|Read all 3 books. Loved how captivating they are. They are truely page turners.  Very hard to put down once you get started reading.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was excited when this product became available for $0.99. I figured that at that cost I needed to see if it met my needs for document generation, editing and control.

B006VKKAWQ|5.0|I have little to add to the reviews already posted. I bought my copy preordered in the USA, and do not have the problems with disc 1 and 29 that the UK edition has. In short, this is a must have. I skipped it in 1992 because I did not have the cash, and scraped up some of the individual issues over time, but it is great to have them all... And to have them all in one handy - albeit heavy - box!
030758836X|4.0|I just bought this book and finished within a few days.  The book was a real page turner, did not end the way I thought it was going to, and the author keeps the reader intrigued very much through the last half of the book.  Good pick, I would reccommend to my friends...
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|You  can read my review on my blog Tomes Devotee<br /><br />I liked this book. It's the first YA I've read since Twilight and I am not sorry. This really could be adult fiction since it dealt with a bit of a heavier storyline. I didn't find it tedious or childish at all.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is trying to escape her past in a new town going to college where no one knows who she is. Her best friend America, who's family has somewhat adopted her, comes with her so that she isn't alone. Starting fresh she wants to steer clear of anyone or thing that is remotely like her past. Well into her life struts, or I should say punches, Travis Maddox the college hottie/bad boy/everyone wants to be with/ guy.<br /><br />Travis Maddox, he is something. Oh yes he is most certainly the school bad boy. He makes his money by being in a Fight Club. That's all I'm gonna say about that cuz everyone knows the first rule of Fight Club is you DO NOT talk about Fight Club. He is brash, full of himself, covered in tats, drinks like a fish, smokes, has a rockin body, oh and happens to be a straight A student...my adoration for the bad boy doesn't show too much does it ;)<br /><br />Abby is a smart pretty confident girl. Such a nice change from mousey clumsy plain Jane who wonders how the stud could possibly like her. She's a hustler in the gambling sense, she's a card shark and I love that!! The opportunity of a bet just gets her going, and this is where one of my criticisms comes in but I'll touch on that in a minute. Try as she might to avoid her feelings for Travis, it becomes impossible especially when she lives with him after the loss of her bet. Its not that she feels he's not a good person or not good enough for her. Quite the contrary, she keeps telling him how good he is. Its the lifestyle she wants to avoid, it being the rough and tumble fly by the seat of your pants adrenaline rush of an existence.<br /><br />The struggles the two contend with as they move from being friends, and they truly are friends, to becoming lovers is sometimes very painful to read. They love each other very much but they are so volatile together. He is uber alpha literally beating the crap out of any guy who he perceives as wanting his Pidge. Her dorm mate Kara asks \\"don't you think its a bit unhealthy that he is so dependent on you.\\" And here is where some will agree or disagree.<br /><br />I don't think Travis is obsessed with Abby. Yes McGuire rides the cusp here big time. He is possessive of her, he adores her, and he is miserable without her. The two are very intense and passionate. Their love is very special and not many have relationships on that deep of a level so it may be hard to comprehend especially since the two are so young. Abby is not afraid of Travis. He never threatens her nor abuses her at all. He was fine on his own he's just learned that life with Abby makes him even better. She \\"completes\\" him :p I couldn't resist, heehee. True he his a tough mofo, but she's no wallflower herself. Obsessive love is no love at all. Telling someone I won't live without you or let you live is sick, telling someone you can do whatever you want just don't ever leave me is sick. That is not the case here in my opinion.<br /><br />My criticisms - I would have liked to see the supporting characters fleshed out more and gotten to know them better. I liked America, Shepley, and Finch. I couldn't understand the reason for not revealing her past till so deep in. It isn't a story spoiler, the fact that her father is a piece of crap just would have added to it. That she loved the thrill of the bet yet wanted to escape her past was a bit of a contradiction. One would think she'd avoid all things that were remotely like her childhood. That just may be me though.  The ending seemed like a cop out on McGuire's part. It didn't ruin the book for me but it just didn't mesh with the rest of the story.  I was not happy with the ending.<br /><br />This probably would make a great book club book just for the shear amount of discussion one could have over this subject matter. I'm sure I haven't touched on every point to be made but I've gone on long enough :)<br /><br />The author is writing a book from Travis' pov which she says is not a sequel but will have a great epilogue so you get a glimpse of their future, and she is doing a B.D. spinoff on his brother Trent<br /><br />All in all, if you like extreme alphas, don't mind some serious a$$ kicking read this book you'll
B0058VW36U|1.0|I can get a few minutes of game play, but it continually freezes my Kindle Fire.  The refund policy is unclear so I don't know whether to blame Amazon or the app maker.  I feel cheated out of 99 cents or an otherwise great game.

B007ZBWJXI|5.0|On their new album \\"XXX\\", Asia just keeps getting better.  6 years since re-forming Asia has released 3 studio albums and 1 live release.  Every Asia fan should get this release, not a dud in the bunch.  John Wetton's vocals are as strong as ever, Steve Howe's guitar playing is spot on, Geoff Downes keyboard work is still top notch and Carl Palmer is still one the best on drums.  I've seen many groups reform and fall flat after their comeback release, but Asia is changing that logic with every new release.  Top tracks, \\"Tomorrow The World\\", \\"Bury Me In Willow\\", \\"No Religion\\", \\"Face On The Bridge\\", \\"Al Gatto Nero\\" and \\"Judas\\".

B00846REIS|1.0|I absolutely hated 50 Shades of Grey. The characters were shallow and ridiculous and had a severely annoying habit of repeating themselves ad nauseum. That being said, Bared to You seems even worse! I didn't think that was possible. It seems to me that if women read more in general they would not be impressed with this type of juvenile writing. There are hundreds of free Amazon books that are actually worth reading and that don't make you hope the main characters are severely hurt or even killed just so they will shut up about how perfect they are!
B007PJFIU6|5.0|Great game overall, the illustrator for this set is fantastic... Fun way to bring a bunch of people together and let your imaginations run wild.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Hands down this is one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing is extremely juvenile and annoyingly repetitive. I forced myself to read the first two books because someone told me they get better, that was not the case. It really makes me sad that with all of the wonderful books available out there, women are going nuts over this. I don't usually write reviews but this was so bad that I couldn't not say anything.
1449320104|5.0|This book is great. It's no nonsense approach to covering the C# 5.0 language is like a breath of fresh air. It is clean, to the point, and thorough. It makes finding a topic, and learning it, or getting a refresher, a very fast process.<br /><br />This new version includes new information on the new asynchronous functions async and await.<br /><br />The authors have a great writing style which makes the book a very enjoyable read. You can read this cover to cover, or use it as a very handy reference. You won't find any case studies, or made up scenarios, to help the authors describe the technology. They stick to writing about the technology, which is nice.<br /><br />I have listed the chapters below.<br /><br />Introducing C# and the .NET Framework<br />C# Language Basics<br />Creating Types in C#<br />Advanced C#<br />Framework Overview<br />Framework Fundamentals<br />Collections<br />LINQ Queries<br />LINQ Operators<br />LINQ to XML<br />Other XML Technologies<br />Disposal and Garbage Collection<br />Diagnostics and Code Contracts<br />Concurrency & Asynchrony<br />Streams and I/O<br />Networking<br />Serialization<br />Assemblies<br />Reflection and Metadata<br />Dynamic Programming<br />Security<br />Advanced Threading<br />Parallel Programming<br />Application Domains<br />Native and COM Interoperability<br />Regular Expressions<br /><br />One of my favorite features of the book is the way the authors do their diagramming. They include a lot of diagrams that give a visual representation of the feature they are describing. The diagrams really help with getting a quick understanding of the overall picture of the topic. The authors also demonstrate with code that is always easy to understand and within the scope of the topic at hand. You don't have 2 pages of code with 3 lines highlighted.<br /><br />If you are looking for LINQ coverage, this is a great resource. The author's do a great job of explaining how it works and thoroughly covering all the features.<br /><br />Another part of this book I love is the way the authors deliver the code samples using LINQPad. I own the full auto completion version of LINQPad and it rocks. I have been using it since its first release and it has become my favorite tool when working with databases.<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this book. It belongs on the shelf of any serious developer./><br />Another part of this book I love is the way the authors deliver the code samples using LINQPad.

1466401885|1.0|This is a book that made me question a lot of things, mostly why I continued to read it. It was like a train wreck, I couldn't not look. The writing was trite, the book poorly written and of course the female protagonist spineless. This is just one more book to add to the piles with Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey.<br /><br />The book details the meeting and relationship of Abby Abernathy and Travis Maddox. Abby seems like a good girl from the start however it becomes apparent that she is the product of a less than happy home. Her father an abusive drunk is more than likely the cause of her attraction to Travis. In the beginning she says she doesn't want to date him, they can just be friends. But it is quickly apparent to everyone else that this isn't the case. Travis on the other hand is the stereotypical \\"misunderstood\\" bad boy. Who really has a heart of gold buried somewhere under the pile of women he's gone through. I think my favorite scene is of course early on after Abby loses the bet (come on, we all knew it was coming) and he leaves in a huff. He goes to the Red gets hammered and brings home not one but two women and proceeds to have a three way on the couch with Abby in the next room. Yeah if that doesn't scream I love you I don't know what does. Her roommate, Kara (who I might add clearly is the only one with a brain in her head), tells Abby that her codependent relationship with Travis ISN'T healthy. But Abby just laughs because clearly emotional and verbal abuse at the hands of your boyfriend is acceptable.<br /><br />Really the book is an enormous waste of time, if I could go back and say I never read it I'd be happier. This is just one more example of the decline in society. Honestly when I read this garbage it's like women's rights never happened. I cannot fathom why any woman would find this situation attractive or think \\"gee that's the guy for me!\\"

034580404X|1.0|Everything arrived in excellent condition and in a timely fashion.  These books, although extremely popular, are ten steps below the worst romance novel anyone ever read.  They really aren't worth your time/effort.  Read something by Nora Roberts instead: she writes great romance novels without the agony in these books and without the terrible language and poor grammar.
1595828753|5.0|This book is in perfect condition and arrived earlier than expected. I got this and part 1 and I finished them both the night I got them. Amazing!
B008B3F38C|5.0|The new direction is great. I like that there are very little guest vocals, they're not really necessary. On previous albums they only left me wondering what Charlotte would sound like on those songs. I love Charlotte's vocals, they're just perfect for a rock band. I also like that it's less symphonic and the guitars are turned up in the mix. I am a heavy metal girl after all.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's the best one yet because the sound is so consistent. It feels like the songs were written at the same time. And I appreciate the bonus live tracks! Thanks Delain for another great album. I like all three of them in their own ways.
B007R9MFPU|5.0|I will be short with this review...<br /><br />If you are not completely spirited away with this album by the end of \\"Live\\", then you simply aren't listening. Midge, Chris, Warren, and Billie sound as fresh now as they did 26 years ago and have produced a record that is a strong nod to their glory days of Vienna, Monument, and Rage In Eden. However...the songs and album sound as fresh and new as anything you would hear from more modern bands.<br /><br />I am SO glad they're back. The world desperately needs Ultravox!!!
0345410025|5.0|I read [[ASIN:0143120530 Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything]] about a year ago and purchased this book, among many others, to start learning memory techniques. I started with this book because it seemed simpler and more accessible than the other I picked up, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />It's a great book and will introduce you to a variety of memory techniques quickly. Some of the more interesting things you will learn how to do:<br /><br />* Memorize lists of ten items or less instantly, for as long as you like. Simple, easy to implement.<br />* Names and faces memory. Memorize a roomful of names and faces. Extremely easy to do.<br />* Memorize 50 digit number with the Major system. Some ideas for how this is useful - license number, credit card number, important dates, etc.<br />* The link system for memorizing lists of any link, frontwards and backwards.<br />* The loci system - very brief overview, but you can pick up enough to learn it.<br />* The peg system - built on the Major system, this will allow you to memorize lists frontwards, backwards, and by number. ex. Presidents in order and who the 17th President was<br />* Memorize a deck of cards<br />* Many applications, from public speaking to sports to party tricks<br /><br />Not the last book on memory I will read, but a good place to start for anyone. You will learn enough very quickly, and there is much more to study and build on should you want to. Highly Recommended. Other books on memory I would recommend:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0143120530 Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1569246297 Your Memory : How It Works and How to Improve It]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1933184175 Memorize the Faith!

B0058UXHHK|5.0|Dear Sweet Rose wasn't supposed to have the life she led but who ever does? When she stops letting her controlling mother make all of her life's decisions Rose ends up in a horrible mystery of murder and deceit with only a few days to live and experience all the things her mother never allowed including dancing. The book was fun, well paced and very entertaining. I gave it 5 stars because I loved the characters especially the dog. It could use a bit more editing but so what. It has all the right stuff to make me want more.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I picked up this album after hearing about her sub-par SNL performance, even though I didn't have a clue who she was or what kind of music she sings. Plus, it was only $.99, so not much to lose. I must admit that the album has grown on me and I have been listening to it continuously for the past week. It is different and dark sometimes, but maybe that is why I enjoy it.

B004UXUX4Q|2.0|THE DESCENDANTS got a lot of press around awards time, and it deserved none of the accolades it received. I don't know if critics thought they had to like it since it came from Oscar winning director Alexander Payne, or if it was because it started Hollywood Golden Boy George Clooney, or if it because it had a nice, sweet, anti-business message. For whatever reason, critics got it wrong. It's unfortunate that this movie is a total bore, except for Sid (Nick Krause) and possibly Julie Speer (Judy Greer), the slacker boyfriend, because the story is a good one.<br /><br />The plot is simple. A man (Matt King, Clooney) is caring for his wife who is in a coma. He discovers she was cheating on him. She is going to die. King has to cope with losing his wife, and never getting to confront her about her cheating. He also gets a chance to meet the man who she was cheating with. The movie had all sorts of opportunities to create a story about forgiveness and reconciliation. Or, it could have gone darker and crafted a story of revenge and bitterness. Instead, it takes the approach of apathy. I'm not saying King or his two daughters (the non-entity Scotty, or the foul mouthed, cute 18-year old Alex) don't care about their mom or her cheating ways. I'm saying that the viewers have no reason to care. Perhaps one of the reason I cared so little is because of the stupid side story about the descendants. It seems King and his numerous cousins have descended from Hawaiian royalty and they face a big decision on who they should sell some property to and make millions. That story line added nothing to the plot.<br /><br />If this movie hadn't been lauded as one of the best of the year, I would have enjoyed it. Instead, I'm tired of watching movies Hollywood claims to be good and being bored out of my mind.  I remember reading a story about Matthew Lillard, who plays the man the wife cheats with, Brian Speer. It made it sound like his part mattered in the movie. But it didn't. He was hardly on screen at all. He didn't matter. Just like this movie. It doesn't matter.dly on screen at all. He didn't matter. Just like this movie. It doesn't matter.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|If you begin a dialogue about progressive rock, you may or may not include Rush in that short list. I fully embrace progressive rock, no matter its indulgences, because, above all else, I appreciate the technical merits of the musicianship. If you asked me whether I'd prefer technically proficient musicianship or manufactured, but irresistibly catchy pop songs, I would still lean towards progressive rock as the better medium. And Rush is one of the few remaining bands with technically proficient musicianship. Sure, they've endured their ups and downs, and what band that has been around for almost 40 years has not? Yes, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Pink Floyd, and even Styx and Supertramp--they've all certainly had their highlights and low lights. I'm also sure that every Rush fan has their favorite albums from the band, just as I do.<br /><br />But my affinity with Rush began in October 1987, with \\"Hold Your Fire\\". That was my first Rush purchase, and I was 14. I think it unusual for a 14 year old to be so musically savvy, but that was me. Heck, I was already listening to Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Powell, Asia, Genesis and GTR before I went into Rush (before age 14). I had no older sibling influencing my musical tastes, and I had no parents who were so hip as to be introducing me to Rush. I came around to them on my own terms. I knew \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"The Big Money\\", but little else. I was sold with \\"Hold Your Fire\\" and you can take that or leave it. From that point forward I bought every new Rush album--\\"Presto\\", \\"Roll The Bones\\", \\"Counterparts\\" and \\"Test For Echo\\" in 1996. It was around that time that I finally had the funds (and time) to purchase all the earlier Rush albums from \\"Power Windows\\" back to their self-titled 1974 debut \\"Rush\\".<br /><br />As is my prerogative, I have listened to each Rush album in sequential order leading up to my listen of \\"Clockwork Angels\\". I like revisiting an artist's back catalog prior to experiencing their latest offering. I am that methodical. So, with that being said, \\"Clockwork Angels\\", for me, is three and a half stars out of five. It's good, but not their best work. I can hear all the offended gasps now. I can hear all the fist pounding. How can he give \\"Clockwork Angels\\" three and a half stars?!<br /><br />Well, there are several points I can make and they all boil down to preference. For example, if you prefer 66 minutes of Rush, you will like \\"Clockwork Angels\\". I always preferred the 40 minute Rush album like \\"2112\\" or \\"Moving Pictures\\". I even enjoyed their 50 minute albums like \\"Hold Your Fire\\", \\"Presto\\" or \\"Counterparts\\".<br /><br />If you like 70's Rush, that was more guitar based, more rock and/or progressive rock, more concept, then you will like \\"Clockwork Angels\\". While I enjoy \\"2112\\", \\"A Farewell To Kings\\" and \\"Hemispheres\\", I actually liked their blend of synths and guitars during the 80's even more (oh yeah, I can hear all the snickering and hisses right now). But it's true, if you listen to their 80's output they really expanded their palette both musically and lyrically, and I believe they utilized keyboards better than many of the new wave bands of the time. Rush were always more sophisticated in their arrangements.<br /><br />If you like concept albums from Rush that tell a story, not unlike some of their 70's works, then lyrically, \\"Clockwork Angels\\" will be appealing. I tend to have some reservations about the fantasy themes Peart liked to write during much of 70's Rush. I tended to like the more socially and personally aware lyrics of 80's Peart, and some of that is definitely evident on \\"Clockwork Angels\\".<br /><br />So, after repeatedly listening to \\"Clockwork Angels\\" I felt it was slightly better than \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" and \\"Vapor Trails\\" and maybe even \\"Test For Echo\\" in terms of comparing their more recent output. For me, it didn't quite measure up to my last favorite Rush album, 1993's \\"Counterparts\\". Yes, I know, how critical can you be, right? Well, again, it's personal taste, and \\"Counterparts\\" seems to me the last time the band was razor sharp in terms of music and lyrics.<br /><br />Let me be clear, \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is a good Rush album, remember, I have given it three and a half stars. There are several songs that I thought were really well done such as \\"Caravan\\"--with excellent guitar work by Lifeson, the title track, \\"The Anarchist\\", \\"Halo Effect\\", \\"The Wreckers\\", \\"Headlong Flight\\" and \\"The Garden\\"--again with excellent guitar work by Lifeson. It's just that at 66 minutes, \\"Clockwork Angels\\" feels belabored much like \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" and \\"Vapor Trails\\" and even \\"Test For Echo\\" all have that belabored feel to them--as if the band is trying too hard, as if they didn't know where to trim the fat. Dare I say that \\"Vapor Trails\\" and \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" have a bloated quality to them, and \\"Clockwork Angels\\" seems to avoid this for the most part.<br /><br />I really don't agree with five star reviews for the sake of five star reviews. I don't believe in gushing over an artist just because I like them. I believe in a moderate and carefully considered approach, especially when it comes to reviewing artists like Rush that have been around for 40 years and have 20 albums to sort through. I mean, are you really going to say that \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is the best Rush album, or one of the best? Really?<br /><br />At any rate, I'm glad to have them back after five years. At the rate they're releasing new material, I suppose it will be another five. At this point, I realize they no longer have to make new music at all, and so I appreciate that they have continued to give fans new material every so often. I'm not going to complain about \\"Clockwork Angels\\" at all. It's good, just like the new Van Halen album is good. Who knows, maybe in another 10 to 20 years I will increase my rating as I revisit \\"Clockwork Angels\\". Here's how the album compares with the band's previous works:<br /><br />1974 Rush: One Star<br />1975 Fly By Night: Two Stars<br />1975 Caress Of Steel: Two Stars<br />1976 2112: Four Stars<br />1977 A Farewell To Kings: Four Stars<br />1978 Hemispheres: Four Stars<br />1980 Permanent Waves: Three and a Half Stars<br />1981 Moving Pictures: Five Stars<br />1982 Signals: Four Stars<br />1984 Grace Under Pressure: Three and a Half Stars<br />1985 Power Windows: Five Stars<br />1987 Hold Your Fire: Four Stars<br />1989 Presto: Five Stars<br />1991 Roll The Bones: Three Stars<br />1993 Counterparts: Four Stars<br />1996 Test For Echo: Two and a Half Stars<br />2002 Vapor Trails: Three Stars<br />2004 Feedback EP: Three and a Half Stars<br />2007 Snakes & Arrows: Two Stars<br />2012 Clockwork Angels: Three and a Half Starsow critical can you be, right?

B004EPYZT4|4.0|This remake of Conan the Barbarian hasn't gotten much respect from fans.  But I think it's as true to the spirit of Conan as the version from way back in 1982, even if it falls a little short of that movie's epic feel.  The sorcery was always a problem for these kinds of movies back in the 80s, and while I generally feel like CGI is overused in todays action films, in this movie it is used well.  Overall it's much better than the recent \\"family friendly\\" sword and sworcery films like the Clash of the Titans remake or Prince of Persia.  It's nice to see the barbarian back in R rated fighting form.
0545123275|3.0|There was a lot to like about Shiver. Not one of my favorites, but definitely a decent read.<br /><br />Grace was an interesting character. My first impression was she acted too grown up for a seventeen year old. It took me a while to warm up to her because of it. It wasn't until later when her situation became apparent that her personality began to fit in my mind. Sometimes experiences do make children grow up a little fast. Sad, but true. Truly Grace was aged before her time.<br /><br />Certainly Sam was an important character. Even though he had his own POV in the story, for some reason he just didn't seem to take lead as I'd expect a main character to do. He seemed to play second fiddle to Grace. Not sure if this is what Ms. Stiefvater intended when she wrote the two POVs, but that's how it played out to me. And it was certainly okay in my mind. A lot of romances are like that, with the female having more of a presence than the male. I wasn't bothered, it just an impression which stayed with me. If I could put some adjectives to Sam's name they would be Loyal, Chivalrous, Persevering.<br /><br />So, I'm looking at my earlier notes and found I had a lot of questions at the beginning of the novel. The answers were answered later in the book, but I remember being very confused early on and asking the question \\"what are the rules?\\" I didn't like the vagueness. In truth, I believe it was a main reason I had such a difficult time investing in the novel. It wasn't until the rules about transformation and such became concrete that I was able to really get into the book. In a way, I guess it was fitting since Grace didn't really know all the rules herself. Sam certainly was more familiar, but he wasn't keeping me privy to all the hush, hush secrets about lycanthropy.<br /><br />One of the things I found fascinating was Grace and Sam's relationship. They reminded me of an old married couple many times in their mannerisms. They seemed comfortable with each other. It was almost as if they'd spent the last six years in each others company and not just a few weeks (or whatever the time period was). It was odd to see their relationship at that maturity level when really everything was so fresh to them.<br /><br />That Grace was the sexually assertive one surprised me.  Even though I'm a prude and want all children to wait before engaging in sex, I found this novel modern in its presentation. Like many YA shows (Kyle KY, Vampire Diaries, Smallville, Pretty Little Liars), teens are doing the \\"deed.\\" It saddens me so little thought goes into sharing an experience which should be special. Yes, quite a few teens are having sex, and Ms. Stiefvater didn't put anything on the table which wasn't already there. I'd be naive to think they weren't. And it'd also be silly to think the heavy petting and spit exchange wasn't a common occurrence amongst some teens. I was a kid once too, despite my archaic mentality. Like I said, I'm a prude despite my fondness for writing and reading erotic literature and talking about sex in general.<br /><br />Shiver has one foot planted in the YA world, while crossing into the adult mentality. End the end, I have to say Ms. Stiefvater did an excellent job. Cause really, isn't that what it's like being a teen? Not quite a child, but definitely not a adult. The in between.<br /><br />Shiver ended rather abruptly. I certainly wasn't ready for the ending and neither was my daughter. After she finished Shiver she came to me with the same thoughts. The story didn't quite seem finished.most as if they'd spent the last six years in each others company and not just a few weeks (or whatever the time period was).

0439023513|1.0|I fell in love with Hunger Games. It was one of the first YA novels I'd read as an adult. I followed Katniss through the first reaping and Hunger Games, then again through the Quarter Quell. I fell in love with her and the characters, as fleeting as some of their lives were. I did my best to avoid reviews of Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins. Yes, I looked at folks' ratings. From what I saw, the rates were across the board. I didn't know what to expect.<br /><br />Okay. I'm going to do my best not to be snarky in this review, despite feel that way toward the book. I'll start by saying I disliked Mockingjay as much as I loved Hunger Game. The pacing was inconsistent with long (not passages) chapters of reflection and back story with little action. Every time I thought I'd hit the beginning of the book, I'd flip to the next page and find myself trapped in more drivel. Honestly, if I hadn't been so invested in the Hunger Games, this would have been a Did Not Finish (DNF). As it was, I just wanted to know what happened to all my favorite characters from the prior two books.<br /><br />If someone were to ask me where the story began, I'd say about page 230. Then the story ended about page 350, except somehow another 40 pages got tacked to the back for some reason. Given that, I'm not really sure why Ms. Collins didn't just add an extra 100 pages or so to Catching Fire and be done with the series. This certainly didn't have to be a trilogy.<br /><br />As far as the characters, Katniss was as drab as the storyline. She spent the entire book wallowing in self-pity as a pawn. She wasn't the subject of Mockingjay; she was the object and did nothing to propel the story forward. I know this is an odd thing to say, but I think Mockingjay would have been better without her. Maybe if the story was told from someone's perspective who had a little more spunk...like Buttercup, maybe.<br /><br />Good thing there was a lot of hype before the release. Folks flocked to the bookstores and preordered without know any about the book other than that they liked The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. One thing for sure, I can see why the publishers didn't release any ARCs. If reviews had gotten out prior, a lot folks would have passed on this one. I for one feel jilted. I can honestly say, customer loyalty has waned for me. Needless to say, I spent quite a bit of time yelling at my husband about this novel.<br /><br />Big breath. Now for praise. One thing Ms. Collins has going for her is she's not afraid to kill of her characters. The good guys don't always win, so it's nice to see a bit of realism once in a while. On the other hand, EVERYONE important doesn't have to die. And I have to admit, I was a bit angry at one or two of her choices. And I might have been able to get over it if the ending wasn't so lame. Oops. I'm suppose to be in praise mode.ordered without know any about the book other than that they liked The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.

I could get it higher but im ok with at the moment.. also it comes with extra accesories to attach a 2nd fan wich is great, i had an extra fan around and attached it to the cooler for the complete push-pull setup. For the people asking about noise... this cooler is great you can bearly hear it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the things I like about the Hunger Games and now Catching Fire is the realism of children growing old before their time. Catching Fire is not a youthful book. Yes, the children are young, but they've faced too many trials and suffered to much to hold on to their innocence. They don't have the typical immature thought patterns I remember as a youngster. They don't have time to be anything but adults despite their age. It's sad, but true, and I like the truth in it as much as it saddens me.<br /><br />Catching Fire was quite different from the Hunger Games. More so than ever, the focus is on Gale and Katniss. It's like a tragic love story which puts Romeo and Juliet to shame. Once again this book had me on the verge of tears. Not just for the situation Gale and Katniss lived but also for the people around them. No matter how much the two victors gave, no matter how perfect the gifts, I could never forget their generosity never compensated for the sacrifices and lost.<br /><br />I didn't see much of Gale in the first book. This book he came out to play from time to time, and I like him. He was candid and had a sense of humor. I'd always seen Peeta as insignificant, weak even, though completely dedicated to Katniss. Gale on the other hand, I saw as a pillar...an equal to Katniss. I'm very much interested in how things will turn out in the end for them in Mockingjay.<br /><br />I just finished watching an episode of Nip/Tuck when Christian's son was kidnapped, and his fiancee thought the boy was taken to be an organ donor. The presumed kidnapper realized she'd reached the low-the unthinkable. How could anyone ever go so beyond humanity to think it was okay to hurt a child? That's the Hunger Games. That's the Capital in the Catching Fire. I reached the end of chapter 4 and all I could think was OMG! Once I got over the shock, I realized President Snow was serious. He was taking no hostages. Any good which might have been in his little shriveled soul had caught fire and turned to ash.<br /><br />In Hunger Games, Katniss was focused and determined to survive. In Catching Fire she was no different, but this time had an awareness of herself on a psychological level. She saw herself as selfish and self-pitying but couldn't shake the feelings. But really, when in misery, it's so hard to think of others, and I love that Ms. Collins brought that factor to the forefront.<br /><br />For me, Catching fire was about truths. The honesty was astounding. The idea someone knew their limits and verbalized them had me in awe. And the honesty to do the brave thing for the good of others nearly broke my heart.<br /><br />Take a moment to read some of my favorite lines as I dry my eyes:<br /><br />*I want to point out that twenty-two dead tributes will never recover from the games he helped create, either.<br />*I looked up into those blue eyes that no amount of dramatic make-up can make truly deadly and remember how, just a year ago, *I was prepared to kill him.<br />*They've got years to eat sugar, wheras you and I...well, if we see something sweet, we bettter grab it quick.<br />*My foolish, shallow, affectionate pets, with their obsessions with feathers and parties, nearly break my heart with their goodbye.<br />*This is no place for a girl on fire.<br /><br />On a side note, when Catching Fire landed in my mailbox, and I dropped everything and devoured this book while my daughter watched hungrily from the side. I passed it to her and consumed it. She turned to the last page, and like the scene with Stuart Townsend in Queen of the Damned, she sat up and said, \\"More.\\" Talk about freaky.and turned to ash.<br /><br />In Hunger Games, Katniss was focused and determined to survive.

They lived a hard life but made the best of it. More than that, they flourished in their own ways despite being in an environment which would break a lot of people.<br /><br />When I did learn about the \\"Hunger Games\\" I was appalled. Ms. Collins brought the incomprehensible to life. This novel was high on the list at goodreads.com as one book people would like to see made into a movie. I could see why. I spent a lot of time blinking back tears.<br /><br />I've heard a lot of critters say to lay off the back story. It's a rule Ms. Collins did not follow, and I'm glad for it. Each bit of back story was a treasure, rich in a way which added depth to her characters. I savored every moment.<br /><br />As for the YA aspect, I thought the novel was very age appropriate. It's a novel I'd let my daughters read. Though there was a lot of violence, each choice had real consequences. Decisions were not made lightly, and Katness was very aware of the stakes. It broke my heart her world wasn't one of innocence. It reminded me of the easy life I take for granted.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This series is surprising in many ways. This is not and cannot be the official vision of the war in the Pacific against Japan. For one it does not show Pearl Harbor and the battle about entering the war. It is not really historical in that way and it does not reflect at all the racial integration Roosevelt was able to assert and impose in the US armed forces then. The political issue is also avoided that way and not one single black GI appears in that series. The only two blacks seem to be the servants of the doctor in Mobile.<br /><br />The second surprise is the fact that the series follows a set of young men and women who find themselves together in the same Marines corps or unit and fight together all along. Most of them will survive and only one really dies on the screen. It is thus a series about a handful of GIs who survived the war, except one, John Basilone, a hero of the very first battles, without really wanting to be one and realizing the importance of the fight when it was occurring, who got a medal of honor for that heroism then and was sent back to the US to help sell war bonds and train marines but decided to go back and this time play hero as a sergeant and gets killed, seven months after marrying, just before going back to the front, another marines sergeant working in the catering services of the training center to which he was attached.<br /><br />In fact the series, all along, follows these few men from before the war to after the war and the emphasis is contrastive: the romanticism of before the war, particularly Eugene Sledge who nearly did not go because of some physical condition, the horror of the war, and the full resignation and disgust expressed by Eugene after the war: \\"We only learned one thing, to kill Japs and I must admit I have become very good at that.\\"<br /><br />Each episode of the series centers on one character or on one battle or situation. Each chapter thus tries to depict and render one problem, positive or negative. One character who loses his physical and mental sanity and has to be sent to the psychiatric ward of the military hospital and that enables us to discover the squalid horror of such a war on some men who are lost forever and are taken care of, that is to say are more or less forced to go on living in their insanity.<br /><br />Or it is a resting period in Melbourne Australia and the relations these young men entertain with the local population, particularly of course the sexual dimension of these relations, with a particular emphasis on one case which is a real love affair and yet has to be called off because the young marine has to go back to the front and the relation has no guarantee to ever have a sequel.<br /><br />Or it is a battle and each battle insists on one particular element though some come back regularly and repetitively. The battles are nearly always in mud and under rain with the negative sides of this: wet ammunitions for example and living, resting and fighting conditions that have nothing to do with anything physically challenging: it becomes an ordeal, a self-inflicted or at least assumed torturing \\"adventure\\" (for the positive thinkers) or \\"descent to hell\\" (for the negative thinkers). But all have in common one point: they can never say and predict that they should or would be alive any minute now and later. Death is the banal condiment of these battles, the salt and sugar of any war.<br /><br />Or it is the battles on Okinawa and hence with some civilians, very few indeed. A baby here next to his dead mother. An old woman who is severely wounded and wants to die and the marine refuses to do it. A mother with her baby running to the soldiers and begging them to take her child and then detonating herself killing as many marines as possible. Then some evanescent band of civilians going in the opposite direction to that of the marines. That's the worst part missing in this series: the local civilians taken in the war against their will and finding themselves between the Japanese forces and the US marines. They definitely do not look liberated in any way since they are not even shown at all.<br /><br />So what is the meaning of the series?<br /><br />It sets the emphasis on the suffering, at times heroic, at times desperate, at times pathetic, at times insane of the marines. It is centered on the marines, the troops that are projected onto the ground from ships and that open up the battle field. The series systematically gives us very gory and repulsive images supposedly depicting the reality of this war for these soldiers or fighters. Corpses, horrible wounds, skeletons here and there in various states of decay, maimed bodies, legs, heads, hands, or whatever other parts of the body missing from the bodies or lying here and there on the path.<br /><br />It emphasizes the discourse the officers, commissioned or not, use to build the resolve and motivation of the simple soldiers who constantly doubt what they are doing. The extremely black humour of these marines, a condition to their mental survival without which there is no survival at all, is developed and presented as the only human way for these men to cope with their announced and practically sure death. Happy will be those who will survive.<br /><br />Happy they say? That's a joke. They will build or rebuild their lives, but will that be happiness with the constant recollection of these hellish days in the Pacific, the un-erasable remembrance of the suffering imposed to them and imposed to the enemy, the un-extinguishable guilty memory of all the killing done that cannot be alleviated by the supposed heroic dimension of the fight. For these individual fighters it was a nightmare and it will always remain a nightmare visiting them every night and every day.<br /><br />So the film is against war, any war. There is no just war. There is no clean war. There is just war and that is a horrible event that should be once and for all banned from human history.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUelves between the Japanese forces and the US marines.

B004LROUW2|5.0|You can't parse Murakami. Page by page, line by line is mighty fine but it adds up to something else altogether. Something overwhelming and somehow mystical and magical. Scenes and characters cannot be forgotten only puzzled over and savored. Like fine cooking, the meal is a feast that is much more than you can guess at from the list of ingredients. Smoke this if you dare.

B0085G0DNU|4.0|Trying to properly assess a movie score based on an album, especially before the release of the actual film and with the inability to properly gather all materials necessary to form a comprehensive consensus, is obviously not an easy task, especially for a soundtrack of this caliber. That being said, I've decided to base this particular review solely on this album alone - i.e. how thematic ideas are presented on the album, the flow and cohesiveness of the CD, and just the scope of the music in general. After all, the officially-released soundtrack is meant to be the testament of the music as a whole.<br /><br />One thing Zimmer has managed to achieve is the creation of a unique and different atmosphere within the music, allowing this entry in the trilogy to have its own identity, without completely disregarding the continuity of the franchise. Zimmer employs further use of heavy electronics to compliment the orchestral sounds, giving the score a scope reminiscent of his work for Inception, but staying true to Batman all the same.<br /><br />Some of the continuity of the soundtrack is inevitably lost due to the lack of James Newton Howard, however, and Zimmer makes definite attempts to mimic his styles and sounds to try and make up for the loss, but the absence is noticeable. Tracks like \\"On Thin Ice,\\" \\"Mind If I Cut In?\\" and \\"Nothing Out There,\\" when they don't directly plagiarize JNH's music, make it quite clear where he would have fit right in with the project. Even so, one can find a certain level of aesthetic appreciation on the surface of Zimmer's attempts to fill in the blanks while still retaining his own style (\\"On Thin Ice\\" remains one of my favorite tracks of the album).<br /><br />An obvious element that can be credited to the identity of this soundtrack is the introduction of the antagonist Bane. The now instantly-recognizable chanting seems to reciprocate Zimmer's unconventional handling of The Joker in The Dark Knight - but instead of reserving the chant solely for Bane, Zimmer manages to make it a part of the score as a whole, tailoring it to compliment various other elements of the music. As far as the music that is exclusive for Bane, however, Zimmer reserves his most vicious and brutal orchestral techniques to date. Sporadic brass and violent strings heard in tracks like \\"Gotham's Reckoning,\\" \\"The Fire Rises,\\" and \\"Fear Will Find You,\\" best highlight these ideas - though, they are admittedly handled a bit haphazardly on the album itself.<br /><br />I suppose the reason for this is that, instead of presenting the music in the form of theme suites, as per usual for Zimmer, the album is almost entirely composed of cues arranged and edited for the film. This admittedly makes the thematic ideas lack certain cohesiveness. While these suites will most likely see the light of day in the near future, it's disappointing to have to wait until then to be able to absorb Zimmer's full and fleshed-out thematic ideas, all the while having only butchered film cues to see what Zimmer was trying to do.<br /><br />Another important introduction is that of Selina Kyle/Catwoman. This is most likely where James Newton Howard would have taken over, but instead, Zimmer employs the use of slinking sound effects and mysterious piano dances to accompany the cat burglar. The end result is fitting - in fact, it's almost too fitting, to the point where the only interesting or unexpected thing about the direction Zimmer took with this side of the music is how obvious that direction was to take. I suppose I may have gotten my hopes up too high as far as expecting innovation, what with Zimmer scratching cellos with shards of metal for The Joker and recording hundreds of thousands of primal chants for Bane. It gets the job done, and it's certainly something we haven't yet heard in this franchise before, but as far as trying to capture the character goes, it's done in a way that seems so obvious as to become uninteresting.<br /><br />On the flip side, another thing Zimmer has managed to achieve with this soundtrack is his fulfillment of the promise of escalating the scale. Tracks such as \\"Imagine the Fire\\" do the best job of making clear the sheer scale of the music at hand. While some of the renditions of prior Batman themes tend to be a bit more of a downgrade from the previous franchise entries (the rendition of the Batman theme at the end of \\"Rise\\" and the short stint around 30 seconds into \\"Necessary Evil\\" seem oddly disappointing as far as sampling goes), there are just as enough moments where Batman returns with more power and force than ever before.<br /><br />That being said, another achievement of this album is that Zimmer manages to bring the music full circle, employing just as many themes and sounds that practically ooze Batman Begins as pay tribute to The Dark Knight. If you can forgive the identical sampling of \\"Prison Nightmare\\" from Batman Begins at the beginning of \\"Born in Darkness,\\" the soundtrack manages to tie together all of these elements from each previous installment in the franchise in stride.<br /><br />Had the album representation been a little better, this would certainly have been another five-star effort from Hans Zimmer. Zimmer has managed to weave together elements from the previous two installments of the franchise while also introducing many new ideas and perspectives on the music to fully bring together Bruce Wayne's journey. It falters mainly from superficial detriments that will hopefully become less prevalent as the soundtrack is further expanded through upcoming special album releases and obviously the release of the film itself.<br />~<br />A truckload of bonus tracks will be available from all sorts of different promotions and mediums. The digital bonus tracks, \\"The Shadows Betray You\\" and \\"The End,\\" play more like remixes and don't cover any new ground whatsoever. The CD-exclusives, on the other hand, are much more interesting. \\"Risen from Darkness\\" is an excellent (somewhat overbearingly-electronic, but it's forgivable) tribute to the epic themes of the franchise, and \\"All Out War\\" is a much quieter and haunting track that seemingly meshes the darker themes of The Dark Knight (think \\"Sonar System\\" and \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\") with a style almost strangely reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's work on The Ring. I have yet to hear \\"No Stone Unturned,\\" but it certainly sounds interesting - I've been told it's more of the case of \\"Risen from Darkness,\\" intermingling themes from the franchise with a reprise of the \\"Train Fight\\" from Batman Begins and even introducing some new elements.<br /><br />Here's to hoping even more music and a fantastic film is in store for us down the road.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Excelent tool for runners!! It has all features that runners need. Compared with order models like 405 or 410, this option don't disappoint. You will not regret buying this GPS-enabled training.
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Fiona apple continues to amaze me with her brilliant lyrics and amazing voice! This album is fantastic all of her albums are but I especially love all of the percussive instruments in this album and I think the lyrics are brilliant and incredibly heart felt. She is able to describe all the things I feel and can not say and therefore I love her! Like a fine wine she gets better with age.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|got the package within two days of the order, and the DVDs were in wonderful condition. the price was also super cheap so I was very satisfied with my purchase.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Series keeps getting better! Cannot wait for season 5. Very cool box set, DVD quality is excellent! Couldn't be happier.
B007SGM084|5.0|what I can say about these book...they are HOT!!! they will make you hot as well. The one thing that I didn't think that much, was that Anna seemed so much more mature then being a 21 year old.  The books were the best, I reas them twice.
B007N85ZXY|2.0|Bit disappointed with this offering from one of my favourites. Doesn't do justice to some American classics. Should have listened to Bruce Springsteen's efforts with classic folk tunes, much better indeed. Some good guitar work of course and quite listenable but could have been so much better.
B000002UAU|5.0|The Best Album ever recorded...period, don't think twice. This is one of the best albums of all time. Every contemporary musician has been influenced by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
0718157834|5.0|Every now and again, I read a book that I know will stay with me forever.  This is one of those books.<br /><br />I picked this book on a whim.  I've never heard of Jojo Moyes before but I've always had a soft spot for British writers.  I was not disappointed in my capricious choice.  Moyes is great at her craft; it's very well written... impressively so considering the sensitivity of the topic.  The main characters, Clark and Will, were engaging and I loved how their relationship developed.  The book is funny and sad and hopeful and heartbreaking and everything in between.  As I was nearing the end of the book, I kept telling myself, \\"slow down... slow down...\\"  I didn't want it to end but when it did, I knew I would remember it all...
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I love the game. The only problem I have is see the levels of the tiles at night. I quickly realized I need my glasses changes.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Slightly cheesy, but entertaining story wrapping together, multiple hidden item puzzles.  My only issue is that if you leave in the middle of a puzzle, you have to start the whole level again.  otherwise, easy to pick up and play.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app. It works as it should, no problem. I would definitely recommend to anyone needing a simple calculator.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very easy to play and addicting. Kids love it. Fun to waste time with and try to beat each others scores.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Great FREE app for this. Needs two things for me: a way to open an exisitng file and &quot;save as&quot; like on a computer and more formatting options such as double spacing, etc. Still learning it, so I could be speaking too soon. Definitely recommend.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I adore this product. I recently picked it up on sale at Babies R Us for the same price as here. It feels very well made. The drink compartments are slightly stretchy and hold just about any size drink. It fits my City Mini perfectly even with my Travel Boppy attached. The zipper compartment is big enough for keys or ID or anything else small like that that you don't want to lose. Really there's nothing else to say about it. It does what you need for a fraction of the price of similar products.
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome!!!!!I think any age can get it and it is fun my family love I recamend it.on a family or non family device
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game so much. it is so so addicting!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant get enough! okay I think I am donenhere now
0385344228|5.0|Great read! Written in true \\"Dateline\\" fashion, you never expect the twists and turns that come in this book.  Exciting and disturbing at the same time.
B007NQVRNS|5.0|Awesome movie.<br /><br />Often watch this while am in boredom mode.<br /><br />great PQ and AQ here on Bluray.<br /><br />Got this for under $10 today at a store<br />so you will have to look for yourself :)<br /><br />here is hoping that Amazon will slash the price! :)<br /><br />Seriously own this movie, you won't be sorry!
B00846REIS|1.0|Beware.  This is a shameless copy of \\"50 Shades of Grey\\".  I should have read the reviews before I purchased it.  I started to read it, and realized that I was reading the same story.  I can't believe people can get away with this.  The names are just changed slightly:  Ana/Eva  Gideon Cross(GC)/Christian Grey(CG).  I would think it is joke, but it is a shameless way of using someone else's intellectual property to make a buck.  I purchased this for kindle and returned it for a refund.  Don't give your money to someone this dishonest.  For shame.
B00785P2QC|3.0|it is a fun game.....was able to get to level 13....then the game would close down as soon as I opened it.....not so fun now.  have uninstalled twice now.....will give it another go &amp; see if it changes after level 13.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|I enjoyed the challenge of upgrading the station by playing in different side modes. the trick to getting credits is playing them in hard mode. you only survive 5-6 minutes and accumulate 200-300 credits. makes the upgrades go faster. highly enjoyed it.
1466401885|5.0|Purchased and read the entire book in one evening - staying up very late, I just couldn't pull myself away.  It was a wonderful read.
0345803485|2.0|I read 50 Shades just to see what all the hoop-la was about. It is about a Jr. High level book. The writing is poor to awful. It is truly hard to understand why it has become such a big seller. Read it if you must ...but borrow it from someone and don't waste your money.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Have read all the Camel Club books, and really enjoy them. I love books that come in serial form. These books are just so well done, and give you a hero that you can understand. Since I am really grown up, too, this is a special treat.  Baldacci writes so well....
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! It works more than great on my Kindle Fire! The only glitches I have is that you really cant turn your corners too early or it counts as a tripp. Other than that great job!
B000FO0AOC|5.0|What can you really say 8 five star reviews.<br />Otis was just on the verge super star status, when his life cut short at just 26 years old.<br />He would have given us so much more music from the heart and soul.<br />This collection gives a great starting point, but some of his stand alone albums are fantastic as well IE Otis Blue, recorded in something like 36 hours.<br />You may have left us Otis, but your soul will live on for ever.
0790731452|5.0|The movie is funny for the most part... Guess you have to have an open mind and 'what if' I was in  this type of situation? Besides that, it answers what a lot of people weren't sure of... Do martians really have green blood? :)  Enjoy the movie for what it is, entertainment!
0307592731|4.0|Good story, but not spectacular. This gal was so unprepared to hike the PCT- she is lucky she survived. Gutsy.

B0084I9QIW|4.0|What about a blu-ray version of this special concert? DVD is (almost) dead! Michael himself would have wanted the best ...
B002ZG98C8|5.0|This is an amazing movie. If you took parts of Itchy & Scratchy, GTA San Andreas, Blaxploitation movies of the 70s, and bad porn, and then had it stirred up, dipped in batter, and deep fried by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's unholy spawn, you get this stupidly perfect movie.<br /><br />Some of the scenes in this insane grindhouse fest will have you pause, rewind, re-watch, and repeat: they are that freaking over-the-top. There were at least a half dozen literal jaw-dropping, eye-bulging, WOW moments. I wish I could share some of the great moments but they have to be witnessed in stunned amazement as I did, without any preparation.<br /><br />Now let's get this straight; this movie has almost no genuine redeeming cinematic qualities. The plot is ridiculous, the script inane, there is no semblance of reality, and there is a moronically heavy handed pro-illegal immigrant message.  However, there is a reason this movie boasts big names and I'm pretty sure it wasn't for the paycheck or the chance to get an Oscar. It's because this is pure artery-clogging joy. If you feel the need to critique this movie you probably also look for the sanitary qualities of a truck taco. I don't know about you, but some of the best food I've ever eaten came from a truck. I can't sum it up any better than that.
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this on my ipod after seeing my cousin had it on hers and it looked fun and became addicted to it and now I'm getting it for this. fun game (:
044024630X|1.0|I have read everything Lee Child has written, but since I heard Tom Cruise is playing Jack Reacher in a movie I can't do it anymore. I put up with Lee's long winded books because the books themselves are excellent. He just gives too much detail about everything and that gets boring. His books could be 200 pages less and be flawless. But when I read the books I would have a certain look for Jack Reacher and that was not Tom Cruise. It no longer works.
0345803485|2.0|A friend gave me this book and felt compelled to read it based on all the hype. Boy some serious marketing was done for a bad read. I am an avid reader and can't even finish the book. If a book is good, I finish it in 2 days. I am at a month and still not done nor I am sure I will ever finish. The writing is like reading 7th grade. Its very obvious its a first book. All the power to her for pulling off the sales she did. Most of my friends who read regularly all agree its a poorly written, slow book. One even said its like the Twilight trilogy. Anyway- read some Jackie Collins if you're looking for some sexy stuff.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|its ok but the games you already beat on free one are the first 14 of each level. there's only 42 games per level and 14 I best on free issue.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|This app will not work on my galaxy note with ICS.I have uninstalled and re installed several times with no luck.
0345803485|1.0|Abysmal writing, ridiculous sex (didn't---was it Ann Rice?---or how about the Story of O?---do this a million times over about 20 years ago? And far, far better?), and subjecting all women to articles like the Newsweek cover about why we all want to be controlled (is this a PLOT by anti-feminist males?)---this is the most ridiculous book I've ever read. Ladies, if you want titillation, read the short stories in Penthouse or Hustler; if you want to read emails, um, read your email; if you wish for a combo of the two, join match.com---but please don't allow this author to make any more money off her amazing P.R. campaign!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app, read this app all the time like the fact it reads to you and you have more than one version of the Bible.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|Would be perfect if it synced over all my devices.  Love the back up feature, super useful app. . . . .
B005NFJAZS|1.0|The disk arrived scratched with fingerprints.  Very disappointing to my little girl who was waiting for the disk to arrive.  I thought that by ordering a NEW, UNUSED disk from AMAZON, not a third party, that I would not have any trouble.  I guess I thought wrong.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Like other town building games. But with a fun old school theme. Oregon trail at its best! Give it a shot.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|The title says it all. This is coming from someone who was a thrash fan back when this came out. This release blew everything away and still does. In my opinion, it is the very definition of what thrash metal should be. Even Slayer can't top this release and they knew it...so they followed it up with a slowed down masterpiece in 'South of Heaven'. If you want virtuoso technicality then look elsewhere. If you want raw aggression and insane riffs with blood-curling vocals, then this is the release for you.<br /><br />The only other release that comes close to the number of riffs that give me goosebumps is S.O.D.'s 'Speak English or Die'.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love love love this app...I am sick in bed today and this gives me hours of entertainment. wish it was easier to get points with out buying them but there Ste easy games that give you lots of points
B0058VW36U|5.0|Seriously people who cares if it has the same levels and needs to update!The little guy is adorable and hungry here!This game is pretty obsessive if you ask me.I first played it on my cousins Kindle Fire and he got angry when I couldn't put it down.<br />Warning: Can come extremely addictive and is cutest game ever.Do not be infected from the little guys cuteness.<br />I would give it a million stars if possible.This game is seriously amazing!Totally worth the price!
B000JML7EC|5.0|A true classic, enjoy reading it, seen different movies of it and<br />still enjoy it. Who wouldn't enjoy reading a swashbuckling adventure.
B004GYY714|5.0|Stumbled upon this amazing app for my Fire and instantly fell in love with it.  I have many different genres that I listen to and unfortunately, not every local radio station carries them.  With this app, I have all the music I love right at my fingertips and many, many stations preset!  So very easy to use!  I love that when you do find a station, program or podcast you love, you can slide the screen over for more related material!!  Endless genres of music from all over the world.  Now if they could come out with an update to be able to categorize all my presets.  But beggars can't be choosers, can they?  Just singing the praises of TuneIn Radio!!  Great app!!!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Excellent product that works well, but since Apple charges only $9.99 for this, I wish I'd ordered from them instead.<br /><br />Because the new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are thinner than they had been, the Magsafe adapters used on older chargers are now too thick. This adapter attaches magnetically to the old Magsafe adapters and presents a proper thin connector that fits the new machines.  If you have an Apple airline power adapter for your MacBook, you'll need this as well or you'll be disappointed when you try to connect on your next flight.
030758836X|2.0|I struggle to give this book two stars. I'm utterly amazed by all the relatively great reviews of this book. Being on the best seller list and seeing all the reviews defining this as a psychological thriller, I was intrigued. It felt like the book went on and on and getting through the first half was TORTURE! After enduring the extremely wordy first half I desperately wanted to finish the book. The ridiculously bad ending made me realize that the author had no idea how to end this book.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|If you are a huge Nicholas Sparks fan then just stop reading this review because you probably won't agree with anything I'm going to say. If you are ambivalent about him and sometimes enjoy his stuff, sometimes don't then continue on. This review is for you.<br /><br />I fall in the ambivalent category. Sometimes his stories are unique and fascinating and wonderful. Sometimes they are predictable, drag on aimlessly, and are generally somewhat outlandish. This falls into the latter category. I have a compulsive need to finish everything I start so I finished this book but I was completely uninterested in the last half of the book. It follows the typical Sparks romance path: boy loves girl, girl loves boy, something happens to drive them apart, they come back together, sad ending. Except that it was so predictable that I wasn't even sad just a little by the end. I was just glad to be done with the silly book. The other good thing is that since they are such simple reads that meant only another couple hours of reading. Flat characters trying too hard to be deep, many implausible story micro-plots, too quaint of an ending. Snooze basically. If this still sounds interesting then by all means, dive in. If you were on the fence hopefully I've convinced you that it isn't worth you time.<br /><br />As an aside, the Cole family reminded of \\"The Wild And Wonderful Whites of West Virginia.\\" So that was mildly entertaining but also possibly something that colored my view of the rest of the story.

0345803485|1.0|This book does for literature what Jersey Shore has done for television....made a joke of it.  Poorly written , overhyped, , and overrated.....it's like a train wreck... You know you shouldn't but hell whats's the harm... Everyone else is right?  Well save yourself $10 and don't bother it's not even worth that.  I have no idea why this book has become what it has but I can honestly say that I enjoyed reading the negative reviews even more than the book itself.  The negative reviews are spot on.... This book sucks ... Someone definitely has a great marketing team....I guess the jokes on us huh snookie?
B001QWBM62|5.0|When it comes to sound, I'm not a sound engineer or an expert, I just know what my ears hear, so all the charts on this product's page didn't really mean much to me. But, using this in conjunction with my DSLR for film making has made a world of difference. The sound quality is so much better!<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who has any needs for sound recording of any kind.<br /><br />Reporters, buy it!<br /><br />Film makers, buy it!<br /><br />Musicians, buy it!<br /><br />If you're in the latter two categories, XLR inputs on the bottom of this thing are a godsend for using great microphones to get amazing sound quality.<br /><br />I've noticed a difference in my work, and I'm sure you will too.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great sound quality<br />WAV format provides best sound quality, but choice of other formats for space constraints.<br />Can be used in conjunction with DSLR and an inexpensive cable for sound monitoring and syncing purposes.<br />Uses SD cards (which are cheap and you might already have a bunch of these)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Must press record button twice to actually roll sound (takes a little getting used to)<br />Short battery life (stamina mode improves battery life but I am still unsure at what cost)<br /><br />Overall, great product that produces impeccable sound for indie film making, musicians, and reporters.

B001MSMULG|1.0|If you wish to acknowledge that vengeance is an acceptable human trait, than this is the book for you. It very early on depicts how two very religiously driven tribes have cultivated hatred for each other. I found it to be a disgusting, although perhaps realistic portrayal of humanity and its ridiculous obsession with religious tribalism. I never bothered to finish the book. Creating heroes out of murderers driven by religion only propagates the practice.
1469984202|5.0|I bought the eBook because it was cheap and could fill the 30 minute bus ride to work. An easy distraction and toss if it failed to impress.<br /><br />But I was not prepared for how engaging it was. It's been a long long time since I've stayed up past midnight because of a book but this was a pleasant discomfort given the joy I was getting from this novel. The characters are beautifully drawn, the plot amazingly hypnotic, the Silo mysteries haunting and the several love stories achingly and tenderly rendered.<br /><br />This is definitely a bucket-list read and I look forward to seeing the movie!

0393088774|5.0|This book is Paul Krugman's attempt to take back the focus of our national economic conversation away from the fear mongering about deficits, inflation and other distrations and to get us paying attention to the real crisis of entrenched, long-term unemployment.  Krugman's core message is this:  our biggest problem is high unemployment that is caused by a lack of aggregate demand.  He builds the case for expanded government spending using examples from history, mainly the experience of WWII, to demonstrate the effectiveness of swift, massive government spending on reducing unemployment.  Just as importantly, Krugman systematically dismantles every argument put forth by right-leaning political and academic opponents of Keynesian economics.  The best chapters are:<br /><br />Chapter 8 - \\"But What About the Deficit\\":  Krugman exposes the political hypocrisy of the deficit hawks who suddenly got religion about the national debt after decades of ignoring it.  More importantly, he debunks the myth that rising public debt needed to fund future stimulus programs would cause rising interest rates and incur the wrath of the bond market.  Bond yields have continued to fall despite increased levels of debt and even the loss of America's AAA credit rating by one of the bond rating agencies.<br /><br />Chapter 9 - \\"Inflation, the Phanton Menace\\":  Krugman explains why inflation has not risen despite massive expansion of the money supply and record low interest rates.  In a nutshell, you can print all the money in the world and force interest rates down to zero but producers cannot raise their prices if consumers aren't spending money.  Low demand means low inflation...period.<br /><br />Chapter 11 - \\"Austerians\\":  Krugan debunks the nonsense of those who claim that austerity is expansionary and the \\"Confidence Fairy\\" will lead businesses to hire people again.  Every nation that has adhered to calls for austerity to reduce spending (Britain, Ireland, Spain) has driven their economy into recession.  We should be learning from Europe's mistakes, not repeating them.<br /><br />In summary, if you're a frequent reader of Krugman's column in the New York Times you'll enjoy this book because it pulls together the ideas behind every column he has written over the past several years.  If you're not a follower of his column in the Times this is a great introduction to one of the greatest public intellectuals of our time.
0143121006|5.0|This is the sad but true story of Pamela Werner, she was a plucky 19 year old adopted daughter of a former British consul - Edward Werner. She was brutally murdered and mutilated on a cold January night in the pre Communist Peking of 1937 and left for the wild dogs to feast on outside the allegedly haunted Fox Tower.<br /><br />Paul French came across the story by chance by reading the autobiography of American journalist Helen Snow, who had gained fame for her shenanigans in China during the violent years that surrounded the Second World War - she had been there at the time and had felt that Pamela might have been mistaken for her on that fateful night. French has pieced together a ton of evidence and visited the sites of Peking to properly get a feel for the events. He also places the events into the historical and political context of the time; this was during the running sore of the Civil War between the Communists and the Nationalists as well as the Japanese incursion from Manchuria where their puppet regime was being used for further territorial gains of the new Japanese Empire. Whilst the Imperial Japanese Army gnawed at the gates normal life became more difficult in the now ex capital and a murder investigation became almost impossible. Both the Chinese police and the British Legation detective soon let the trail go cold, but Pamela's father was made of sterner stuff and the more he looked, the more skeletons fell out of more cupboards.<br /><br />I found this to be an utterly absorbing read; from page one I was pretty much hooked. This is not because of the interesting story but because French has a style that is both accessible and engrossing. He has also provided a wide range of source material that shows he is not making stuff up, as I did think on a couple of occasions that he was using a bit of poetic licence with the tale, but no, he is just retelling the facts in a more vibrant way.  He also has some pictures both from the time and of the places today which help make the characters come to life. All in all a great little piece of forgotten history that is brilliantly told and I very much look forward to his next one.y which help make the characters come to life. All in all a great little piece of forgotten history that is brilliantly told and I very much look forward to his next one.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I read a review about how the acting isn't that great. Well that is what makes this movie so REAL. You don't have big name actors that always remind you that this is a blockbuster movie and not a movie about real life events. The acting is great, the script is amazing, and the end will make you cry. I usually don't cry during a movie but this movie had a real impact on me.
0439023521|5.0|I started reading this because I kept hearing how great it was. I typically do not like \\"sci-fi\\" types of books but I was able to borrow it from someone so I gave it a shot. It was slow going for the first 70 pages or so but then once I got past that, I couldn't set it down.  I stayed up all night to finish reading it and then couldn't wait to get the second book!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Absolutely amazing! I love animals and initially started reading this book because I thought it was about a dog. It is about a dog but so much more. It was a story about family, love, and life. As it tells the story about Enzo (the dog) it  takes you inside \\"his family's\\" life.  I laughed, cried, laughed, and cried some more. I have recommended this book to animals lovers and those who don't love animals so much.  Definitely a must read!

It is only by showing this debt of gratitude that producers will be willing to make more shows of this quality when they see that people appreciate their efforts.

1609611543|5.0|I stumbled upon this book when I was searching for something to get for my new E-reader and it has literally changed my life.  Dr. Davis does an exceptional job of presenting the case against the altered substance that modern wheat has become.  The varied and complex interactions that modern wheat has with our bodies can be hard to grasp in their entirety.  As a Registered Nurse I enjoyed the scientific explanations but the book was not so technical as to be something that people with no medical background would have a problem with.<br /><br />Although I have never been considered to be overweight, I did have a stubborn accumulation of fat around my middle and as I got further into the book I recognized that other problems I have (acid reflux, irritable bowel,thyroid problems)are very likely to be the result of a wheat saturated diet.  I immediately cut out wheat in all forms and based on the positive and almost immediate results my family has experienced, I will never go back to wheat again.  I have lost 4 inches around my waist, the acid reflux and irritable bowel are gone and I feel better that I have in years.  My husband who had been fighting a losing battle with obesity, has dropped 2 pants sizes and is losing about a pound a week.  My son who is in his mid thirties has also lost weight and inches and is now able to again fit into clothes he wore in high school.  I mentioned this book to a co-worker who has had similar positive results in the areas of weight, skin problems and intestinal discomfort.<br /><br />I recently read that veterinarians are now seeing an increase in the number of overweight pets (fat pet birds are now referred to as \\"perch potatoes\\").  I checked the package of \\"premium\\" bird seed I have been buying for my birds and sure enough, it has both wheat and ground wheat listed in the ingredients.  Perhaps their little bodies don't do any better digesting this altered wheat than humans do.<br /><br />I think it is tragic (read criminal) that the harder we have tried to eat a more healthy diet (i.e. whole grains as recommended by the so-called \\"experts\\"), the more unhealthy we have become. Since a wealth of research has apparently existed for some time on this issue I have to conclude that there as been a deliberate effort to hide the truth on the part of the government and powerful forces representing the multitude of people who benefit from our population consuming wheat and getting sick doing it.  Thank you Dr. Davis for this wonderful book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great read. I think better than the first book. Can't wait to read the final book. Hopefully the best of all.
B00005LB50|4.0|The main complaint usually given to Buffalo Springfield's box set treatment (titled \\"Box Set\\" - and why not?) is that the fourth disc is, rather than a summation of the quintet's legendary live performances, merely made up of their first and second albums in remastered versions, although many of the tracks already appear on discs one, two and three. That being said, it's the only thing of which the buyer must beware, because otherwise, Buffalo Springfield's \\"Box Set\\" box set is a magnificent chronicle of a band that imploded in just under three years, yet managed to leave a beautiful burn on rock n' roll music.<br />Of course the essential album tracks are present from the group's three studio records - \\"leader\\" Stephen Stills' era-defining 'For What It's Worth,' the blazing three-guitar country-rock of 'Go and Say Goodbye,' Neil Young's early cryptic compositions like 'Flying On the Ground is Wrong' and 'Out of My Mind'; plus further mindblowing innovations from their second album, \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\" - 'Mr. Soul' (here in an alternate mix), 'Expecting to Fly,' 'Broken Arrow,' 'Bluebird,' 'A Child's Claim to Fame'; and finally some rediscovered gems from their epitaph \\"Last Time Around,\\" such as an unreleased mix of 'On the Way Home,' an outtake recording of the draft-dodger's blues 'Four Days Gone,' a remix of 'Pretty Girl Why,' and guitarist Richie Furay's signature country piece 'Kind Woman.'<br />But as with most box sets, \\"Box Set\\" is made well worth the price of admission by its wealth of previously unreleased songs, demos, and experiments, all of which only add to the surprisingly involved history of a band that only survived roughly three years; several familiar names in rock n' roll pop up in the personnel to some of these rarities, including Buddy Miles of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Band of Gypsys.\\" The numerous unearthed tracks that are most intriguing include Stills' heartbreaking demo 'So You've Got a Lover,' 'Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?', the instrumental 'Falcon Lake (Ash on the Floor),' 'Down to the Wire,' and Young's mysterious demos 'One More Sign' and 'The Rent is Always Due.'<br />The unnecessary, but admittedly handy as a stocking stuffer, fourth disc is almost made up for by the set's extensive booklet alone, which features a ton of newspaper clippings, photographs, memorabilia, interview snippets, and a jaw-dropping history of Buffalo Springfield, including a complete chronology of every live gig played under the BS banner. For the music fans' sakes, I hope this set becomes more readily for sale soon, so that more students of classic rock can fully appreciate such depth and complexity of a hippie band formed on the spur of the moment on a California roadside.strumental 'Falcon Lake (Ash on the Floor),' 'Down to the Wire,' and Young's mysterious demos 'One More Sign' and 'The Rent is Always Due.'<br />The unnecessary, but admittedly handy as a stocking stuffer, fourth disc is almost made up for by the set's extensive booklet alone, which features a ton of newspaper clippings, photographs, memorabilia, interview snippets, and a jaw-dropping history of Buffalo Springfield, including a complete chronology of every live gig played under the BS banner.

B003XQG0JI|4.0|With few exceptions (Sir Paul, maybe) solo albums don't quite live up to the success of the original band. 'Dream of You' is one of those exceptions. First, Sharon didn't try to carry on The Coors success and style of music. No, instead she dug deep into her song writing talents and came up with a simple, but sophisticated sound that makes the album worthy of a world class entertainer.<br /><br />Her cover of 'Smalltown Boy' is actually more of a re-write. And the final result is a hauntingly beautiful arrangement that is far superior to the original. It's serious subject matter is performed with the class and intensity the song deserves.<br /><br />I usually find instrumentals on any album are mostly fillers. Not so in this musical offering. Sharon's collaboration with legendary guitarist, Jeff Beck on 'Mna NahEireann' is one of the album's best tracks. Her violin prowess is most evident in this inspiring performance.<br /><br />Her piano style reminds me of (one of her musical influences), Joni Mitchel. And she demonstrates this especially well on 'Butterflies', (something to which most entertainers won't admit).<br /><br />Overall the music on Sharon's debut solo album is honest and heart-felt..... I guess real talent never fades.

B008CJ0KI8|4.0|I wasn't impressed by the nostalgia/ULTRA mixtape last year, and I wasn't really going to purchase this.  But once I heard \\"Sweet Life\\" with its throwback classic 70s vibe, I was sold.<br /><br />\\"Thinkin' Bout You\\" has a lazy, psychodelic feel to it, while \\"Super Rich Kids\\" clearly berates children who have it all and incorporates a piano back beat similar to Elton John's \\"Benny and the Jets.\\"  \\"Monks\\" infuses classic soul with a futuristic spin.  \\"Bad Religion\\" in its confessional tone backed by an orchestra ends too soon when he really starts to belt it out from the heart...you just want it to go on as painful as it can be to hear him sing the lyrics.  The Andre 3000-assisted \\"Pink Matter\\" is trippy and feels like it's high off something, leading into the coincidental \\"Forrest Gump\\" with its slick word play.<br /><br />And those are just some of the highlights--\\"Sierra Leone,\\" \\"Pilot Jones,\\" \\"Crack Rock,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" and \\"Lost\\" compete just the same.<br /><br />As unbiased as I can be, without the hype--from the \\"letter\\" to the retailer lock-out over the digital pre-release--I'm sure that this album would've fell through the cracks, which often saddens me from all the really good R&B albums that have come out present and past that just don't get their proper due.  So truth be told, it's good for business.  But this is refreshing contemporary R&B music, in a crucial time where the genre frankly has been stalling for a good number of years, especially amongst male artists who all sound the same, look the same, and carry that same macho bravado that Frank Ocean is clearly the opposite of.  He's beyond a great writer and I really can't recall this much excitement and buzz over an album since \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.\\"<br /><br />I won't call the album revolutionary, creative, deep, genius, the best, etc. etc. because for a lack of better words, this is what music used to sound like honestly: cohesive, effortless, detailed.  I think people forgot (if you're around my age), or just aren't used to this (if you're younger) due to how the industry has gotten lost for the sake of the almighty dollar.  This album plays like a project, just not someone who got in the studio and recorded a bunch of tracks and put something together.  Some serious thought was put into this.  I listen and can hear the influences (D'Angelo, Pharrell/N.E.R.D., Prince immediately come to mind), but its really besides the point.<br /><br />What this album accomplishes is proof that good music still exists, that it still touches no matter race, creed, status, and ultimately triumphs over all.  In turn, one can only hope it will inspire artists and record companies to try harder to push the envelope.ound my age), or just aren't used to this (if you're younger) due to how the industry has gotten lost for the sake of the almighty dollar.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'll start off by saying that I'm a HUGE reader; I usually finish a book a day. I picked up Beautiful Disaster because I'd heard so many great things about it, but I wasn't expecting much. Independently published authors tend to have works filled with typo's and plot holes, but Jamie McGuire does not.<br /><br />Out of all the books I've ever read, BEAUTIFUL DISASTER is one I will keep coming back to again and again. The characters have so much depth and emotion pours out of them on every page. Abby is a strong, fiesty character whose relationship with Travis opens her heart and mind to new possibilities and a new future. Travis' character growth is astounding to read, and I love the fact that once he found what he was looking for, he just couldn't give up.<br /><br />Yes, this book contains language, sex, underage drinking, and partying etc... But this is the kind of book that gives you a realistic glimpse into today's world. I read the \\"1 star\\" reviews, shocked that people wouldn't just fall in love with this book like I did. Those reviews center on what makes this book unique, which confused me. I can totally see a youth minister reading this book and falling over, heart attack and all... But to me, a 17 year old girl, this book shouldn't be changed one bit. The vernacular, sex, partying, etc. adds to the world of Travis Maddox. So yes, if you're sensitive to that kind of stuff, maybe this book isn't for you. But, if you can deal with the fact that this is how some young adults act in the world, I would most definately read BEAUTIFUL DISASTER.<br /><br />I think that the people who don't recommend this novel are those who want today's teens to read about unicorns and rainbows; that isn't reality. BEAUTIFUL DISASTER shows you how people can change, how love can change them, and how to accept others. This novel gripped my heart and continues to capture me every time I read it. The writing is that of a truly naturally talented author, and shows beauty in its simplicity. Not only is the story unique, with just the proper amount of cliche to keep it interesting, but it's inspiring. It doesn't tell me to go out and sleep with whoever I see, or to drink and party on the weekends, but it shows me that I should respect and accept everyone before I judge. This novel has seriously opened my eyes, and I will continue to re-read it until Jamie's next book, in Travis' point of view, is released. 5 stars and a HUGE recommendation.

B007L6VR12|5.0|Wes Anderson is a true singularity. I suppose I aught to be amazed he manages to get green lights on his projects but I'm glad he does. This film is no exception. It is one of the most wonderfully weird flicks I've ever seen.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Sam is an outsider in his scout troop. Suzy is an outsider in her home. The two meet, fall in love, and head for the road. The rest of the troop, the family and the local police band together to find the lovers.<br /><br />It's difficult to convey how entirely odd this film is. The characters, the sets, the story are all goofy beyond belief. But somehow it not only works, it makes its own sense. And all the actors seemed to get it. They all played their roles to a \\"T.\\" Even Bruce Willis (this is not his usual fare) worked his part and made it happen. Now, to be fair, there were some heavy guns here. Ed Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, to name a few, are all veterans, so that should be a given. But the two kids are first timers and they managed their roles beautifully as well.<br /><br />The film is gorgeous. The opening doll house-like scenes, with their clean lines and primary colors, made me wonder (until I saw the moving bodies) if I were watching an actual set or some bizarre special effect. The outdoor scenes (this is set on an Island off New Hampshire) were idyllically filmed. I wanted to be there. The music score/sound track was great as well.<br /><br />There is nothing in this movie I didn't like. It reminded me how versatile the medium can be, and how it can fill an audience with a sense of wonder. I don't know if I would want to meet a person who didn't like it, because it would make me think that something inside of them has died.
B006LM6P0K|5.0|This is an incredible film that really makes you think and you actually believe this happen.  The ending of the movie and the way humans will face near extinction is a big surprise.  Better than all the other Planet of the Apes and I am a fan of the original, but this one is just very very good.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just stayed up way too late reading this book, and I have no regrets.  The stories come in perfect, bite-sized pieces, even though I couldn't put it down after starting the first one.  The plot and writing are both excellent, and I related to the characters.  The only thought I had after turning the last page was, More Please!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|thievish a fun game to play. the only problem I have is that it wont irate and it has the same words over and over. but you should get it.
0307155102|5.0|I've been looking for a look of words like this for our 22-months-old son for a while and am very happy it's been here all along!  There's tons of interesting pictures on every page, and lots of themed pages to choose from.  The little guy is currently obsessed with boats, so that page is particularly well worn.  I have no doubt that as his interests shift and vocabulary grows, this book will remain a favorite.

0985114606|1.0|This book somehow got onto the New York Times bestseller list.  I erroneously thought that might mean it was worthwhile.  What a waste.  It's one giant sex-laden swoon.  It's an updated, modern version of the dime-a-dozen paperback romance novels that feature smoldering looks and heaving bosoms and the like.  A well written sex scene can be enticing.  This book is just one long sex scene.  I really cannot believe I bought this book.  This is a book I just cannot bring myself to finish -- it is THAT bad and that foolish.  I see no subtleties, no real plot other than lusting after one another.  This is not artful or interesting writing by any means.
030758836X|1.0|This book sucks, do not bother it is a waste of time, and money Grrr  The only good concept , Cool Girl, I buy that, but after this the author had nothing, to me it seems like was making plots out of nowere

0345803493|4.0|I loved the story of these three books, but in my opinion anyone could write a story like this. I wished the author had a larger vocabulary, it seemed she used some of the same words over and over, but I can over look that. I was ADDICTED! I LOVED IT! Some of the descriptions of the scenes seemed too cliche but I understand it a exotic novel series and that is to be expected. I thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy and am passing it on to others.
B001GCZN12|5.0|I saw this on youtube and absolutely loved it.I'm a big Nightwish fan.This concert with a full symphony orchestra and choir was just the best concert I have seen in a long time.I own a lot of concerts but this band is just awesome.To spend that much to pull this concert off must have cost a bundle,but to them it was about the best show they could pull off. They absolutely didn't disappoint.Sharon's voice is awesome and for the price to get a DVD and CD can't be beat.Buy this soon before it's out of print.This band is great and I hope them continued success.Not all the concert songs are on the cd.The concert is two hours with some backsage extras and 5.1 and DTS sound.I would like to thank the other reviewers who recommended this.

B008BQL77K|5.0|SUITS, one of the brighter shows from last season has returned for Season 2 and some changes have occurred.  There is still the ongoing repartee between senior lawyer Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht) and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), the beautiful but always-serious head of the firm Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) casts her spell -but now we have the return of the old partner Daniel Hardman (David Constabile) to stir up trouble.  Themes are more serious, the women play a more important part  - Sarah Rafferty and Meghan Markle - and the nemesis Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) is as wily and oily and repulsive as ever. The storylines continue through episodes and the writing seems to be better fleshed out this year.  Good wines are better with age and that is the case with this series. Grady Harp, July 12
0345522478|3.0|This book has a great deal going for it. There are well-written scenes, a fairly good overall story, a wonderful Irish Wolfhound and quite a few chuckles and even some belly-laughs.<br /><br />However, the protagonist has it too easy. He is perilously close to being a Mary-Sue and only the humor in the book and his own sense of humor saves him. He's just too powerful and he's awfully immature for someone centuries old. And he means well, which is almost unforgivable.<br /><br />Also, we are told, and often shown, that _everything_ is true. There are every kind of supernatural being that has ever been imagined in this world and many of them turn up in this novel. That made it tough for me to take the story even as seriously as the author seemed to wish, which wasn't very seriously to begin with.<br /><br />Well, there's not much wrong with fun and the book is fun. My suspicion is that the author could do better and he is still writing and I am still reading, so let's see what happens.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to get addicted to. You have to keep playing till u win which could be for<br />hours.<br />Definately recomend
1881273873|5.0|I am enjoying this book a great deal and it feels like the book is written just for me. Everything the books talks about and describes makes me think so much harder about my past and how come i didn't notice that sign or pick up on that. So this book is simple amazing and i recommend anyone who wants to change the way they look at relationships and to improve upon them get the book. In general it is a great read as well.

1416549447|5.0|The book has changed the way i run in slow increments and i have not finished yet and i am so happy i ordered this book. It is helping me for long distance as well as making me more efficient runner. I used to never like to run and now i enjoy it cause i still work hard but i get more out of it and i let my mind go as opposed to focusing entirely on running which helps a great deal. I haven't finished yet but for my job i have to run and its getting me on the right track.
0385341008|4.0|Let me say that I love this book.  I began reading with the impression that the story would be a light comedy of manners.  It became clear, fairly early on, that the story deals with darker issues:  war, occupation, and loss.  The \\"characters,\\" or participants in the communications--the structure of the story is a series of letters--are revealed gradually and subtly.  The voice of the \\"primary narrator\\" is kind, loving, and sincere.  Every event and every character is deeply moving but presented in a most understated tone.  Their views on life are revealed through their views on the literature they are reading.  Now, since I only just finished reading the book, I will comment first on my freshest impressions, and that is that somewhere near the end of the book, the tale (told by many) takes on a disconcerting shift, a shift to the mean-spirited and the farcical, a story that is not rooted in characters who are influenced by great literature.  Again, I love the book.  But I was terribly disappointed in the way that the characters' aspirations and the \\"plot-threads\\" of the story were resolved in a most contrived and superficial way.  (Still 4-stars, for its great potential.)

This story is aspiring to all because of the courage and determination the maids showed despite many obstacles!

0446691437|5.0|The War of Art is an incredible explanation of the resistance inside us that often can't be explained. Defining what the problem is is the first step in facing the resistance full steam ahead. Once it is defined you might have a chance to tackle the resistance that is in everyone's way when they want to accomplish anything of value. This is a great book of descriptive imagery painting a picture of an extremely subjective and situational problem explained as plainly as I believe possible. Along the way you're able to hear about resistance's relationship to Steven Pressfield's personal desire to be a writer and author. Worth your time.

B006R1T40I|4.0|I'm really on the fence with SLIPSTREAM, Bonnie Raitt's first new studio release in almost seven years....On the one hand, any new material from Raitt is cause for celebration.<br />  However, on the other, there's just something missing from this album. Not as lackluster as 2002's SILVER LINING, but nowhere near as varied and adventureous as 2005's SOULS ALIKE (What's with all the \\"S\\" titles?!?), much of the disc is just sort of...there.<br />  I think the problems are twofold...first off is the fact that Raitt originally recorded a full album's worth of ballads with producer Joe Henry. After hearing the finished product, Raitt decided the disc needed a little more spice, and went back into the studio to record some new tracks. By piecing it all together, the end result just doesn't flow...it's all very \\"crazy quilt.\\" (And as strong as Henry's producing is with, say, Rodney Crowell, Raitt requires someone with a little more grit).<br />  Secondly, by relying too heavily on the same writers ~ between them, Al Anderson, Bob Dylan, Joe Henry and Randall Bramblett wrote or co-wrote nine of the disc's twelve songs ~ the album just has an overall feeling of \\"sameness\\", and that's NOT the Bonnie Raitt I've known and loved for 35+ years now.<br />  The album's opening track, \\"Used To Rule The World\\", is a prime example of this....it's a nice enough cut, but it's nothing that we haven't heard before (and to better effect) from Raitt. It certainly doesn't make you go \\"Ooooooh!\\" the way so many of SOULS ALIKE's tracks did. Just....O.K.<br />  Ditto \\"Right Down The Line\\"....Raitt should be able to nail this breezy number in her sleep, but there's just something almost ~ God, I hate saying this! ~ phoned in about the cut. The arrangement, the vocal....none of it tops out at more than a seven. And coming from someone who's a perpetual ten....!!!<br />  Dylan's \\"Million Miles\\" fares considerably better. Right from the opening line of \\"You took a part of me that I really miss\\", the song is awash in attitude and a groove-heavy vibe. The arrangement and instrumentation are spot-on, while Raitt's lead vocal is sultry and smooth. THAT'S what I'm talking about!<br />  It's kind of telling that the two best tracks off of an album by one of rock's premiere female artists are ballads, the first being \\"You Can't Fail Me Now.\\" An atmospheric arrangement and a lovely vocal wrap around stunning lyrics like \\"The stain of love's a smudge upon my brow\\" and \\"I bit off more than I can chew/It's something that I tend to do.\\" Sheer perfection.<br />  Up next is \\"Down To You\\", one of SLIPSTREAM's few out and out rockers. Raitt's a natural at this kind of song, so it's really no big deal. However, the fact that A) the cut is loose and lively, and B) the disc NEEDS more rockers, makes it more enjoyable than it might be on a stronger album.<br />  \\"Take My Love With You\\" has a nice airy ~ yet earthy ~ groove to it. An economical arrangement and muted instrumentation allow Raitt's assured, grounded vocal to shine. Toss in sterling harmony vocals and you have a real winner.<br />  I don't think anyone would disagree that \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\" is one of Raitt's top 2 or 3 songs, and probably her premiere ballad. \\"Not Cause I Wanted To\\" isn't \\"I Can't....\\", but it's very, very close...maybe on par with \\"You\\" from LONGING IN THEIR HEARTS. The whole track is brilliant, but it's stunning core is the vocal, undeniably one of Raitt's best to date. Honest, open, unadorned....it's a thing of absolute beauty. THIS is master class singing!<br />  \\"Ain't Gonna Let You Go\\" is another one of those songs that would have fit nicely on any other Raitt album over the last 40 years. It's enjoyable enough, but we're veering awfully close to something akin to auto pilot here. Raitt can do better than this.<br />  As is evident with \\"Marriage Made In Hollywood.\\" The stripped-down, yet tuneful, arrangement buoys the stinging lyrics about fame and the media's boundries (or lack thereof). Raitt's relaxed, yet knowing, lead vocal is perfectly augmented by Paul Brady's amazing harmony vocal. One of SLIPSTREAM's true gems.<br />  There's nothing particularly deep about \\"Split Decision\\", but, in the end, the cut is so dang infectious that, by song's end, you just don't care! Raitt's silky, smoldering lead bobs and weaves alongside Al Anderson's spirited harmony vocal, as the pair trade stunning guitar riffs back and forth. I LOVE this song!<br />  A master interpreter like Raitt can add new life to a song, and that's just what she does with Dylan's \\"Standing In The Doorway.\\" Just listen to her phrasing on the line \\"There are things I could say but I don't\\"....just brilliant! Another one of the disc's high points!<br />  There's a quiet, hushed beauty about \\"God Only Knows\\" that is equal parts mesmerizing and whistful. Patrick Warren's gorgeous piano perfectly complements Raitt's stunning vocal, resulting in a closing track that is simple in it's depth or deep in it's simplicity....I'm not quite sure which! All I do know is, this cut leaves me breathless every time I hear it!<br />  And after almost four decades, that's the effect I want every time I put a Bonnie Raitt album on. I don't know if she's still waking up from her seven year hibernation, stretching her musical muscles after her long winter's nap, but there's just something about much of SLIPSTREAM that has me feeling as if Raitt isn't firing on all engines here. Truth be told, this is really a 3.5 star album, but I'm rounding up because it's Bonnie Raitt. After cutting her the same slack with SILVER LINING, I gotta say....I sure hope this is the last time!

Finally got it and was so excited I dumped my other book so I could start this one immediately.  Sheesh.  What a massive, dumb disappointment.  So juvenile, I couldn't believe it.  And so out of touch with women and men and literature, too.  Read about 200 pages before I returned it to the library.  UGH what a poor excuse for a book!!!!!

The story pieced together nicely over the course of the book, with personal stories plus a glimpse of the impact the 'African rabies' had on the world. A good read and recommended to fans of zombie and vampire books (warning: contains no vampires!).

B006LSZECO|2.0|The writer has a way with words; however, the story left me feeling cheated.  If you are going to give me an unsatisfying ending, at least give me something that is morally uplifting or at least hopeful for the human condition.  This just left me feeling that I had wasted my time.  The first half of the book was good.  Had to push myself into the second half.  The writer pulled me in again, but then left me with a bad taste in my mouth at the end.  I would not recommend the book.  If it was the only thing around, read it -- other than that chose something else.
0345803485|5.0|Why some readers are giving the 50 books such a low rating is beyond me. What exactly are they looking for? Is it a masterpiece - NO! It's not meant to be. Sure there's some wording used that doesn't sound like an American girl - SO WHAT! Who cares?! It is what it is! A fun easy spicy read! I've been reading \\"erotica\\" for many years too - much like the folks giving low ratings - sure some are better than others - but some are over the top too. I wouldn't even call the 50 books erotica - I'd say more a spicy romance novel, Harlequin Romance on the little blue pill. It's fiction - not fact! It's for the masses - not the fetishes. Many normal everyday women are enjoying the pages while their children are playing in the same room. Many husbands are reaping the benefits of a wife with some new ideas!! This isn't suppose to be in your face porn - it's a romance - a dance - but instead of the \\"screen\\" going to black - you get to \\"see\\" the whole thing unfold. Much like what Judy Blume wrote back in the day - I say, nice, easy, fun spicy read.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I love this app because its fun but it takes a long time to purchase that's why I picked like it
034580404X|5.0|When I ordered these books I was just curious.  I had heard so much about 50 Shades of Grey, but not what it was about.  I started the series as a bedtime reading. It turned into an all night reading.  I couldn't put it down.  My husband eventually became curious as to what was in these books that kept me up all night. I started reading them out loud from then on, he was as hooked as I was.  This series so well written that you can't help but wanting to know what happens next.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I bought this trilogy for my fifteen year old son who, by the way, hates reading. He couldn't them down. In fact, I think he inhaled them at warp speed. I wish there were more for him to enjoy. All young adults can identify with Catnis who provides the perseverance and courage necessary in a dark world. Through her trials she endeavors to overcome them in ways you wouldn't expect. Twists and turns get us to the end of Book I, thirsting for more. I highly recommend all three books to parents looking to entertain their children through the long summer holidays.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I really like the look and quality of this product.  I bought it for use with a new Canon HF M500/M50/M52 camcorder which is very light, so there is really no issue with this product \\"flexing\\" with this type of camera (but that may be an issue with a heavier DSLR, etc.).  I used it to film a live event, and I just didn't feel like it helped me to control that shot any better than if I was just holding the camera.<br /><br />I will use it for a few reasons: (1) It looks cool and give my little HD cameras a bit more more \\"substance\\", (2) it does give you the ability to do some shots (e.g., action, low, etc.) more easily, and (3) it's a great platform for mounting a light or shotgun mic, as the super-compact modern HD cameras don't have the size and weight necessary to support larger accessories.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|My new favorite game on my Fire is Open Sea!<br /><br />Your job is to part the seas to allow your little pilgrim people to cross.  You do this by dragging your finger through the four bands of sea.  You can move individual bands, which is important as sometimes new groups try to cross before the last group is done.  Occasionally, they are also chased by mummies.  ;D  You have a goal (save 8 people out of 9, for example) for each level, and like Angry Birds, get awarded one, two or three stars depending on how well you achieve your goal.  Additional powers and challenges are unlocked as you proceed through the game.<br /><br />The little people make adorable little noises and the graphics are clean and attractive.
0345803485|1.0|So everybody's talking about it and I wanted to see what the big deal was.  Nothing but poorly-written trash.  I think I could've placed my dog on the keyboard to randomly press keys and it would've ended up a better book.  I can't understand the mass appeal; I thought if Ana muttered, murmured, bit her lip, said \\"Oh my\\" or \\"Holy sh**\\", or referred to herself as \\"Steele\\", or if Christian gave her a knowing glance with a half smile one more time, I was going to puke.  I finished this book only because I hate to not finish a book I've started!  Don't waste your time.  There have GOT to be better porn books than this?!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game works fine with me maybe you guys should check your Internet connection  anyway they upgraded it yesterday. and it still works just fine.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|When I read the first book in this series, I couldn't put it down. I literally lost sleep trying to finish it. With this book... not so much. There's a lot of repetition in terms of the scenes between Christian and Anna. I felt alot of it could have been eliminated as it didn't necessarily move the story forward. I am still loving the darkness of Christian's personality. Personally, I still find his possessive streak super sexy!
B007SGM084|2.0|So poorly written with continuous \\"my sex\\" instead of vagina, or any variation and the word Er...drove my crazy.  I bought one, put the others on reserve at the library and can just bag it.  I don't get the hype unless it's among those who have never read a Jackie Collins novel or watched a cable soft porn film.<br /><br />College student meets weathly man by accident, she's conviently a virgin, he's into domination..I was left craving a story, not just their relationship.  It was what it was, like a pick up at a bar and no substance.

From that perspective, I really am impressed by these Sony MDR-7506's.  The sound is quite nice, very satisfactory for my discerning ear.  And the noise cancelling is most efficient for my purposes.  I do not ride on airplanes, so this review is no use for those who do, but otherwise the noise cancelling is terrific.  They fit comfortably as well.
B0068RHSCW|1.0|As I said, this is so predictable it's ridiculous. I'm not saying there aren't any surprises in the movie, but instead of feeling intrigued and wanting to learn more I just found myself eyerolling at every new twist. As did the friends I sat down and watched this with, the most excited anyone got was in the first 30 minutes when you think there's a murderer outside the house.<br /><br />After the reveal it just goes downhill, the ending was out of nowhere and not in a good way. It's not horrible to sit through one time but I can't fathom how anyone thinks this is a good movie. We've all seen it before. It's The Others meets Shutter Island meets Identity, the timeline is thrown together horribly and the story just wasn't very good to begin with.

1401307787|5.0|This was actually the first book I ever purchased on Amazon back in the late 90's.  I was going through stressful situations at work and decided to read this on my commute in to work every morning  (I took the Long Island Rail Road.  I would read this book for about 20 mins and then fall asleep I was so relaxed.  Instead of starting work with a pit in my stomach, I went in to a stressful situations with a clam mind and a lightened heart.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is undergoing stress especially the psychological kind.  It is also a fun read.
B004EQAVHI|3.0|I will say that this is well acted, but sheesh....what a depressing film!<br />Jesus Christ it's just a non-stop downer all the way through.<br />Relentless.<br /><br />The whole time i was thinking, \\"why don't they just run away? Crack some skulls and just get the **** out of there.\\"<br />In that respect, it is a completely unrealistic portrayal of normal human behavior.
B0034G4P4O|3.0|Overall, this movie was a huge let down for me, story wise, despite the amazing animation and incredible action sequences.  The only reason this movie gets 3 stars, is for the animation, not the story. If I was rating on story alone, this would get only 2 stars.<br />I will say, apparently this movie is based upon a book series, which I have not read. So I can't compare it to the books.<br />The story follows a young reporter on his quest to uncover the story behind what happened on a ship, starting with his purchase of a model ship of the same name at a street market. And his adventure begins, with his faithful dog as companion/side-kick.<br />First, the animation is incredible, the eyes, the hands, the hair, clouds, relfection in the water, action sequences, etc. In fact, the animation is so good, you can hardly tell at times it is animated, which is amazing. The directing is incredible as well, particularly with the action sequences.<br />Where this movie fell short for me, is in the story department. I simply was not capitvated by Tin Tin, or his adventure, and I should have been. Present me with a \\"hero\\", reluctant is better, present him with a challenge or obstacle, and proceed to kick his butt, while I spend my time rooting for him to win and come out on top.<br />Obviously, this movie had quite a budget for animation. But it lacked the same attention, focus, and follow through in the story's foundation.<br />You can spend millions and make the most beautiful movie in the world. But if your beautiful movie doesn't have a strong story to match the awe-inspiring visuals, you've got yourself a \\"dud\\", in my opinion.
0345803485|4.0|I was sucked into buying this book after hearing so much about it from friends.  I read the reviews on Amazon and totally expected that I would be disappointed with this book.  Okay, I admit it isn't great literature.  And not personally being into BDSM, a lot of the book did make me say \\"ew[...]\\"  BUT, I'm hooked and about to order book 2.  I can't wait to find out what happens to Anastasia and Christian!  I guess this will go on my list of guilty little pleasures.  Would I recommend this book to friends?  Yes, with reservations, and not to every friend.  But to friends I know will enjoy a salacious little pleasure, FOR SURE!
1878424319|5.0|'The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom' is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read my entire life.  As someone who has had lots of challenges and pain, I have continued to battle my own demons and inner troubles and never found a solution to my internal issues.<br /><br />Until I read this book.<br /><br />Short in length, but amazingly deep in content, this book will be your personal salvation for leading a fuller, happier life removed of pain and trauma.  It's not a binary solution that immediately works as a cure-all, but if you read this book and actually LISTEN to what it advises, you will be that much closer to finding inner peace and happiness.  Then you should read it again, and read it again, and read it again.<br /><br />If you have tried other avenues for finding contentment in life, you owe it yourself to reading something that will truly CHANGE your life once and for all.  This is a rare text that you find once in a lifetime.<br /><br />***** ESSENTIAL READING

B007MJ9LA2|2.0|Let's just say I've re-dubbed this album \\"Dream Catcher\\" because for some reason it sounded very much like it should be played in a new age store and would accompany the picking out of dream catcher earrings very well.  I'm not saying Carlos isn't a skilled musician by any stretch, the parts where he is doing his thing are the best parts of each song but otherwise...not good.  There are certainly times where the music picks up and is interesting but others where I felt like I was watching the opening credits for a Lifetime movie.  We are going to see Santana live in a couple of weeks and got this album just in case they (as many artists do these days) play all their \\"new stuff\\" but I'm assuming / hoping that won't be the case.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|TO: CG<br />  Re: lip biting<br />  From: Disappointed in NY<br />  Dear Mr. Grey,<br />  Your story almost had the desired effect,but the MULTIPLE redundancies by your author are amateurish buzzkills. Take out all the shades, lip-biting, speaking into mouths, never-leaves, wide spaced emails and reiterations, paraphrasing and out& out repetition and your books become pamphlets. Please consider the acquisition of a thesaurus and submitting yourself to some alternative phrases. Hope you don't get shot in book three, but I'd rather read the fridge manual.<br />  PS Although a healthy dose of gonorrhea might serve you well
0385721234|5.0|Uno de mis libros favoritos. Me encantan los personajes, el uso de exageraciones metafóricas --como cuando Tita nace llorando y hay sal para muchos años--. Es uno de los libros que leí en menos de 24 horas porque no pude soltarlo. Lo recomiendo sinceramente.<br /><br />Es una historia divertida, con momentos reales, con momentos 'mágicos', y algunos trágicos. Muestra al México revolucionario desde 'otro' punto de vista. Tiene un dejo de inocencia aunque la historia no es inocente.

B004EPYZT4|2.0|Conan the Barbarian is a mediocre action film. The storyline is extremely generic and you've most likely seen something similar many times before.<br /><br />What did I like? Conan does have some decent action scenes and a few \\"wow!\\" moments; I liked the sand scene a bit. It had decent acting from some of the cast. Music matched the setting.<br /><br />What did I dislike? As I previously stated, it's extremely generic. The young, pretentious Conan wants to be a warrior but his father tells him he isn't ready to wield his sword yet because he doesn't think when he fights; later, his father dies and it leads to your typical revenge flick. The characters had no depth and I found most of them very annoying. Very little dialogue and background. I thought the film would be saved by the action, but there aren't any mind-blowing scenes aside from a few vicious deaths. A couple of sword fights but nothing to set it apart from others. Also, it had small things like a decapitated head blinking and a dismembered hand moving; why??<br /><br />Overall, I feel a bit generous giving this film 2 stars, but it isn't the worst movie of all time. It has plenty of problems and I don't recommend paying to watch it. If you have Netflix Streaming, save your money and view it there (available as of 7/13/12).<br /><br />This movie has plenty of nudity and a sex scene. It also has excessive violence and gore.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I've had a pair of these for about two months and I use them like crazy.  The surround sound is nice but not as nice as a full surround system, and in some games it's hardly noticeable, but I've liked the effect while having to watch movies silently and the wireless feature is awesome.  The forty foot range doesn't do it justice. My house is 100 ft long and I can use it almost clear to the other end of it without having any trouble.  Luckily, the mic automatically mutes when you put the mouthpiece up, otherwise this massive range would have caused a bit of embarrassment! ;)<br /><br />From other reviews, I had heard that they can start to break down after a year or so of heavy use. Know that they come with a 2 year manufacturer's warranty before you go out and buy an outside warranty!  I ended up buying a 3 year replacement plan on them quite cheaply, so the investment is protected no matter what happens, but it would have been nice to know about the one it comes with anyway.<br /><br />I caught these on sale, and that definitely effected my decision to buy them, but if you have the extra $$$ and want to try them out, consider my review a green light.

0345803493|5.0|Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele had a shocking eye-opening experience in the end of book one.  This has rocked them personally and emotionally as nothing they have ever experienced before.  The second book picks up seamlessly from this experience and continues on in the aftermath.  Truthfully though, while this time the book is drenched in emotion, it is a relatively short span of time for which I am truly grateful.  While a portion of the book was drenched in emotion, it is focused solely on Ana's emotions and was starting to grate on the nerves.  At this point, Christian re-enters the picture, and together they make the decision to move more slowly and compromise even further to be together.  Neither one wants to lose the other and are willing to go to any length to keep each other.  You can truly see the love they feel for each other.<br /><br />While Christian and Ana work on their relationship, life moves forward in the book and people from Christian's past have come to haunt them.  One person forces them to be together around the clock strengthening the relationship and showing more sides to these characters than have been shown previously.  This person is one of Christian's ex-lovers that has had an emotional break.  Her motivation is rather vague and so is her target.  Christian desperately wants to help her through her troubles while keeping Ana safe.  There is an emotional and physical confrontation that later seems to be another turning point in Christian and Ana's relationship.<br /><br />The other person threatens their relationship by preying on Ana's insecurities and by taunting her with Christian's past.  Mrs. Robinson enters the picture in a very big way in this book.  Instead of being just a nebulous character, she becomes real and interferes in their relationship by trying to reveal the truth in Christian's past.  She tries time and again to get Ana alone to do this task, which infuriates both Ana and Christian.  Little does Mrs. Robinson know, Christian has told Ana of his past and she is accepting, even understanding, and loves him despite it.  Mrs. Robinson does not take this news well as she sees herself as the only woman that is good enough for Christian.  The relationship between Mrs. Robinson and Christian becomes progressively strained and reaches a breaking point.<br /><br />Christian's past is revealed little by little in this book, and it is heartbreaking.  It explains so many things and how he seems emotionally stunted in some areas.  Christian still has his hang ups, but he makes so much emotional growth in this book it is impressive.  Due to this, you can truly begin to see how he and Ana are a much more compatible couple than previously.  Because of this unveiling Christian and Ana both seem much happier in their relationship.<br /><br />In this book, there are a lot of situations and emotional revelations that put this relationship to the test.  This reveals the inner strength of both characters that was previously lacking.  In the first book, it seemed to concentrate on the turmoil of both characters along with their flaws.  In this book, those are stripped away leaving the characters more human and the story more believable.  They each cope in their own way on how these situations and reveals affect them and their relationship with each other.  These two still have a ways to go before they are completely comfortable with their relationship and all it will entail, but they have a solid foundation to work from.<br /><br />The book ends with a big announcement that is a happy announcement and a more relaxed air.  At the end of the book, a subplot for the next book is revealed leading the reader to a sense of dread, well at least for me.<br /><br />Overall, this book was just as good as its predecessor.  There is not a doubt in my mind that these books are a must have everywhere.

0345803507|5.0|This book starts off a few months later than where the second book left off.  This is a whole new perspective of the couple as it starts in a rather happy place.  Now for the first few chapters, there are flashbacks of the months that make the story come alive in a way I didn't think that I would enjoy.  (I am not a fan of flashbacks.)  These flashbacks are turning points along the way, major events that took place, and emotions that are touched upon.  This adds more overall to the whole of the book than it detracts and was very enjoyable.<br /><br />Throughout this book, the momentum of their happiness is infectious.  I was grinning like an idiot the entire time I was reading this book.  You really start to see just how much character development has taken place during this time in the book.  Of course, all good things come to an end or in the case of the book...decline.  Their happy bubble bursts, and they are grounded back in reality by a shocking accident, or so they assume.<br /><br />[Be advised that if you do not want to know anything about the last book, stop here.  Come back and finish my post when you've finished the book.]<br /><br />Events from the past book, remember the tantalizing subplot, catches up with them.  It creates a lot of tension between the characters and some great dramatic moments.  This story is intense in a whole separate way from the first one.  Yes, the sexual tension is still going strong, but the dramatic tension is increased tenfold.  Threats are made on Christian and Ana's lives, and they are trying to have a normal loving relationship in the midst of this.  The struggles that take place both emotionally and physically are a joy to read.  It shows you whole other sides to the lengths people are willing to go for their emotions and wants.<br /><br />Christian and Ana have both come a long way from the first book and continue to evolve through the second.  In this book, they are still growing but gain maturity that they lacked before.  There is a shocking announcement that at first seems is going to be the breaking point in their relationship and before that can be worked out completely, Ana is put in physical danger.  It is a huge emotional time between the two main characters and completely nerve racking to be honest.  In some ways I didn't want to read any further because I wasn't sure that they would get their Happily Ever After (HEA), but continue reading I did. Boy, was it worth it!<br /><br />After all these dramatic twists and turns, Christian lays his emotions bare with Ana.  It was amazing to witness and realize the depths of the character and how far he has come from the first book.  Of course, Ana also has progressed rapidly throughout the book, and they have finally reached a stable loving relationship.  This is very definitely a HEA!!!  This book was a great conclusion although I am saddened by the fact that fifty shades is over.<br /><br />In my opinion, these books are well worth the time to sit down and read them.  These books will take you on a wide range of emotions and transports you into another world.  I savored every moment I was immersed in the stories that the author created.  Now that may not seem true as I have read all three in a short span of time, but it is.  They took me on an emotional roller coaster and were in my thoughts even as I was doing other things.  The story of these characters will stick with you.  These books were amazing and touch something in you that you may not realize was there.e.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is an excellent four function calculator but it is just that, a four function calculator. There are no fancy functions and if you like circles it doesn't know what Pi is and for triangles there are no sine cosine or tangent functions. But what it does do it does well.

0553582038|2.0|I love this series and the first 3 books get a 5 star rating from me. That said if this is  what he has come up with for the next two books, He should rewrite them! In this Book he goes off on tangents. If the Hound is dead, drop the subject. What is with Mother Stark still being alive? Beric? So many characters we don't need to know about. He should have stuck with the main characters and not the minor ones. It's very disappointing to read the first three and expect more in the next one and not get it. I am reading two other books while reading this one, I never did this before. I keep going back to see if it will get any better. So sad.

0345803485|5.0|OMG, REALLY? I love the book, And yes I can belive what I've read so far, To say that something like this can't be really is my question to some, did you stop and do some research? Yes I guess a lot of what's she is going thru may not ring my bells, but if someone like this guy get a hold of her, and the life he had a young age. This can and does happen. It's like some people I've meet in my life before i got clean and sober, They could make millions if they all got together and wrote a book on their lives.<br /><br />She is changing him is what i see in the story and yet she is changing too. Will she become a female him, only with limts? It's crazy i know, but i would never think a teenager wrote this book without crying to know say, what the hell is happing in this child life, get what i mean.<br /><br />Some people are just into some stuff that we can never see ourselves doing, but it doesn't mean it don't or can't happen. I'm in love with them both and want them to be the person I want them to be at the end. But who's to say what's normal for us, it's normal for them. If both wants it, like they say to each their own, you know.<br /><br />Now don't get nasty with me about it, just know my past life i've run into somethings that would blow your mind, Everybody that get caught up in the street life make back with some pain, some come back and don't know what right or wrong, with sex. they just change. Anyway I love the books and looking forward to finish the rest.<br /><br />Rebieanna.

0062206281|5.0|Spanish author Carlos Ruiz Zafon's new novel, \\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\", is the third in his series set in Barcelona. Taking place in 1957, with flashbacks to 1939, Zafon returns with young bookseller Daniel Sempere and his older friend, Fermin Romero de Torres. The two friends, celebrating Fermin's upcoming marriage to his long-time girlfriend, are faced with an uncomfortable fact: \\"Fermin Romero de Torres\\" officially died in 1939. He was listed as dying after escaping from a brutal Spanish Civil War prison outside of Barcelona. He's lived \\"off-the-books\\" for the past 18 years and now he has to become officially alive.<br /><br />In confiding in Daniel, Fermin has to recount his time in the prison. Convicted of \\"war crimes\\" by trumped-up charges, Fermin endures a year or so in captivity with others who are there on equally vague charges. By 1939, Francisco Franco's Nationalist government had consolidated power in the war which began in 1936. The prisons were full of political dissenters as well as common criminals. Conditions were terrible and prisoners were often beaten and shot for no apparent reasons. Fermin was held with a famous writer, a murdering thief, and a doctor.

I thought it would help  to have read the previous two books in the series, but the author says it's not necessary; the reader can read the three in any order. That's good to find out because for some reason I missed reading the second book in the series. Carlos Ruiz Zafon's writing is superb; both his plots and characters are right on the mark. The books have been noted as being \\"dark\\" and \\"gothic\\", but I think that's not right. Ruiz Zafon writing is SO evocative of Barcelona of the period that what appears to be \\"dark\\", really isn't. Maybe it helps to have visited Barcelona, because I'm familiar enough with the setting that I can see in my mind the places he refers to.<br /><br />I can heartily recommend \\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" for the readers of either or both the previous books in the series. I can also recommend it as a stand-alone novel. As for me, I'm going to order the second book right now!isn't.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I purchased this box set (soft cover) two or three weeks ago, and I am already well into the third book.<br /><br />This series is phenomenally written; it draws you in and just when you think you have an idea of what is going to happen George R. R. Martin throws a in a wrench from left field.<br /><br />As a person who doesn't usually read fantasy - I thought it was all about wizards and magic and non-human creatures - I was wary about reading these books. If you have doubts about them, reconsider, because the books are absolutely exquisite! They are about more than wizards and magic and trolls and things of that nature; they combine to weave an intricate web of story lines about many people who are all striving for the same goal, just in different ways.<br /><br />If you have have watched any of the HBO series, it actually runs fairly close to the books with a few things added or slightly altered to make the series run smoothly and make sense.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin's saga is a great read for a fantasy or non-fantasy fan!
B005LAIIS0|1.0|DON'T go see this movie.  Boring and cliche.  zero interesting scenes and depressing as well.<br />A total waste of Hollywood actors time and material.
1573228737|2.0|There are novels that cause you to wonder how, HOW, the author could go on writing every day. To do so seems an act of devastating tedium.<br />This is one of those.  From early on -- and I am not one of those who thinks of Sarah Waters as a lesbian writer; I haven't read her enough -- the lesbian theme was clear, and the direction the plot would take was fairly clear.  It only remained to work out just exactly how the denouement would look.  It looked just as I thought it would.<br />The only virtue of this novel was its depiction of late 19th century English prisons -- and I have no way of gauging how accurate that is.<br />I consider this a huge waste of time -- but it was on my Kindle, and I had some hours to kill in a waiting room.<br /><br />I bought it because I liked The Little Stranger.
0756407125|4.0|Those who loved The Name of the Wind will not be disappointed: THE WISE MAN'S FEAR is as meticulously plotted and beautifully written as the first. Which means that you should just read my review of The Name of the Wind for all the reasons why you should read this series, and in this review I will talk instead about some of the things I found, well, a little lacking.<br /><br />As the morning of the second day dawns on Waystone Inn, Kvothe continues to recount his incredible life story to Chronicler and Bast. The University goes on as ever but Kvothe is beginning to realize that, in order to find the answers about the Amyr and the Chandrian that has been obsessedly searching for, he may need to leave his beloved University--nay, even leave familiar lands completely--and travel to the far-off land of Vintas, where he dabbles in court politics, robber-hunting, Fae relations, and more.<br /><br />I found myself making a Star Wars comparison as I closed the cover to THE WISE MAN'S FEAR. Specifically, that this book served all the purpose of Episode 2: The Attack of the Clones: it was exciting and adventurous, but hardly answered any of our questions from the first story. In THE WISE MAN'S FEAR, Kvothe pretty much remains the same and does exactly the same sorts of things he did in the first book: he verbally spars elegantly with his superiors, gets into nearly impossible situations and gets himself out or through by dint of his cleverness, and on and on. Oh, and in THE WISE MAN'S FEAR Kvothe adds to his overflowing litany of good qualities some mad skillz in the sack. Kvothe is this perfect hero who experiences no growth throughout books one and two, and it's finally begun to grate a little on my nerves.<br /><br />Kvothe goes on his adventure under the pretext of learning more about the Amyr and the Chandrian, but narratively speaking, that seems like just an excuse for him to get into increasingly unbelievable mini-adventures, none of which seem to aid him on his ultimate quest of avenging his parents' death. Which is why I made the Star Wars comparison: I'd be curious to find out if, at the end of the series, his side journeys into Vintas and beyond are actually essential parts of his path to the Chandrian.<br /><br />For the most part, Patrick Rothfuss characterizes beautifully: supporting characters such as Simmon, Wil, and Vashet stole my heart and demanded more page-time than they were allotted. However, I simply cannot get behind Denna as the love interest. It's almost like Rothfuss wrote a lifetime's worth of frustration over females into this impossibly beautiful, charmingly clever, woefully haunted woman. She represents the embodiment of unattainable female perfection, and therefore Kvothe is living out the male population's dream by getting closer to said unattainable female perfection than anyone has before. Their dynamic is unrealistic, self-delusional, and more than a bit annoying. (Don't get love lessons from Kvothe: you don't win over your perfect partner by never giving them any indication that you like them as more than friend, because you're scared that they don't like you back in the same way. This leads to unhealthy cases of unrequited love, in which you can't move on in your life.)<br /><br />With all that's been said, however, I will still devotedly read the third and last book in the series when it comes out. Fans will appreciate this installment that's chock-full of Kvothe's diversionary adventures, but boy, I hope questions will actually be answered in the next book!mate quest of avenging his parents' death.

0307887448|3.0|Ready Player One has a really great start, and a great concept. Cline does an excellent job setting up the book's world in the first 30-40 pages, and I was immediately invested in the book. The way the characters are forced to live makes a fair bit of sense, based on the Cline's brief description of the events that led up to it. The goal is clearly communicated at the beginning of the book, and the puzzles/riddles do keep it interesting, especially if you're able to pick up on some geeky 80's references. That aspect of the book is a lot of fun. Despite the gripes I'm about to list below, the book is enjoyable, and I believe the author has the raw material to build a world that I'd love to revisit.<br /><br />That being said, here are the large, underlying problems with the book:<br />1) The characters are flat. Even though there are 4 or 5 in the main team, there is very little detectable difference in personalities. Sure, there are some stereotypes that are used for each of them: \\"Geeky, not very friendly girl\\", \\"Geeky, not very friendly guy\\", \\"Geeky, not very friendly guy #2\\", \\"Asian guy number 1\\", \\"Asian Guy #2.\\" There was a scene toward the beginning of the book where it shows a few of them interacting along with someone neither of them seemed to like. I expected this would be a scene where the characters would be established, show off some of their flaws, etc. Instead, what you get is a few people trash-talking each other using internet-forum-esque insults for 10 pages. For a page, that's entertaining, for much more than that, it's stupid and groan-inducing.<br />There is a romance in the book, and it's never made all that clear as to why they're that interested in each other beyond some basic high-school level crush.<br />As far as bad guys go, there's no question over who's bad and who's good. It feels unsatisfying.<br /><br />2) Plot developments & philosophical manifestos happen suddenly without any buildup or effective tie-in to the story.<br />This was abig gripe I had with the book. The protagonist chooses to spend almost all his life in the game, and the author drops what seems like a paragraph in the middle of the book that actually goes into the problems with experiencing everything through the computer, and not really doing anything in the real world. When it's not effectively tied in, it seems forced. There's also an oddly placed discussion on the concept of white privilege about 3/4 of the way in. It's about 1 page long, and is never heard from before that point or after that point. It seems cheap and forced.<br />Certain plot developments also occur in this manner. At certain points, the protagonist will do something that is reliant on something that is part of how the book's world works. However, that mechanism is never mentioned or explained prior to the character taking advantage of it. It's similar to if I told you someone was running away from a bear in the woods, and then suddenly uses a  jetpack to get away because it's a requirement that everyone in the book has a jetpack. It just seems like it's not fully integrated.

This group of survivors is led by Ottway ( Neeson) who has questioned his own mortality at the beginning of the film. Aside from the elements, the plane goes down during an ice storm the survivors must defend themselves against wolves who slowly start eliminating them.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|My friend reccommended this to me and I really liked it. It was definitely a different type of story. I was blown away by the creativity of the plot. The book jumps around a lot, from chapter to chapter, character to character. Watch out for that or you will be fairly confused for awhile. The ending threw me off. At first I didn't really like it, but after a day I changed my mind about it. Amazing story. Should be an awesome read for ya. I think you'll agree with me after you read that that clock is freakin sweet!
1936608898|5.0|Dallas and Melissa Hartwig are cutting edge in their presentation of what is the ideal diet for us to follow. Their combination of research oriented and science based arguments with practical application makes this book a must read for anyone wanting to understand the area of nutrition and diet. My patients want to understand the logic behind what to do with their diets as a motivation to make the changes in diet that will improve their health and this book accomplishes all that.<br /><br />I'm making this required reading for all my patients as a way to start to come to grips with how far off the track we have strayed in our modern food habits and how frequently we find people being confused as to what is food and what amounts to a modern concoction that may look or seem like food, but is so highly processed that we can put it in our mouths and get some pleasure but that will ultimately end up having a destructive effect.<br /><br />Get this book now and read it and send a copy to all those you care about to spread the word on how we can improve our health through simple dietary changes.<br /><br />Dr. Daniel Kalish
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I got this album when it was first released 6 years ago, and I liked it--I thought it was good and pleasant and catchy. But I would not have described it nearly as glowingly as I do now. I think Disc 1 might be one of the best rock albums released so far this century. I can't think of a better one. Even with the songs that seem safe and relatively banal, like \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\" and \\"Hump De Bump,\\" there are magical stretches with so much complexity and energy that I can't help but to shut my eyes and Rock Out.

030758836X|3.0|Gillian Flynn is a talented writer. I was entranced when I read her first book Sharp Objects. I read about Gone Girl in Entertainment Weekly and immediately went to the bookstore to procure Gone Girl. I was initially hooked by the alternating narratives of the present and the past told by a husband and wife, but saw the 'twist' coming from the first one hundred pages. I skipped ahead to the page where a helpful reviewer told me the twist occurred and read on from there, not requiring anymore character development of what I can only describe as narcissists in love.<br /><br />Flynn conceived a novel with a lot in the hopper and hoped that her book would be one that managed to meld two very different genres together - on the one hand a well-written literary thriller, on the other hand a cogent meditation on the disappointments, revelations and compromises of marriage. I am sorry to report that she didn't quite make it and instead the entire novel ends up being less than the sum of its parts rather than more.<br /><br />Nick and Amy are young, hip, successful culture merchants in the New York of the nineties and early oughts when the bottom drops out of the cultural writing market and they find themselves in a leased McMansion in a flyover state with the first bloom off their marriage and no end in sight. They no longer complete each other and their love no longer makes them perfect in their eyes and the eyes of their partner. There is a good description of narcissism here and of narcissism gone all the way to sociopathy but because the novel can't decide whether it is a thriller or a character study or a farcical meditation on marriage in the culture of narcissism the characters read as less of an intimate revelation than the author intended. On the day of their anniversary, Amy disappears and it becomes clear that Nick is most likely responsible. Who is responsible for the disappearance and the devolution of their marriage is the work of the rest of the book. Gimmicky and well-written enough to make the flaws pass unnoticed during the reading the ending and large portions of the novel are unbelievable and skimmable.<br /><br />Will do well as the literary mystery beach read of the summer but won't stand the test of time - very much a novel of the moment. That said, Flynn has talent and is an author to watch and read again. Gone Girl just didn't quite come together.y and well-written enough to make the flaws pass unnoticed during the reading the ending and large portions of the novel are unbelievable and skimmable.<br /><br />Will do well as the literary mystery beach read of the summer but won't stand the test of time - very much a novel of the moment.

B000001C6M|4.0|Wow, was the metal world given a shot in the arm in 1983! Metallica and Mercyful Fate released their debut albums that year but no band made such an ugly, aggressive and over-the-top record as Huntington Beach's own Slayer when they released their first LP, `Show No Mercy'. Death metal would now become the extreme of what was already an extremist form of rock music and most pundits concur that Slayer truly laid the groundwork for the onslaught that would follow. On such groundbreaking pieces as `Black Magic', `Die By the Sword\\", \\"Evil Has No Boundaries\\" and \\"The Antichrist\\", no band had ever combined such a lethal stew of Satanism and graphic violence with such mind-blowing speed and aggression.  Lead guitarists and main songwriters Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King created such a molten stew of evil that bassist/lead vocalist Tom Arraya could only belch and scream about the atrocities that were being committed in the name of Satan or the God of Metal (aren't they one in the same?). Dave Lombardo's double kick speed drums add the final nail to the coffin as Slayer would challenge their fellow California thrash brethren Metallica for a major role in the new era of heavy metal.  Almost 30 years on, `Show No Mercy' loses none of its aural shock value and while it may not be the most sophisticated LP of Slayer's legendary career, it is the blueprint from where it all came from... Evil, my words defy...Evil, has no disguise....you gonna argue with them?

0674032810|4.0|The Annotated Origin: A Facsimile of the First Edition of On the Origin of Species is the edition to pick up, for two reasons:<br /><br />1) The First Edition is the clearest presentation of Darwin's ideas. Darwin (and his contemporaries) hadn't rediscovered the genetics work of Mendel. (A copy of which Mendel sent to Darwin and was found unopened amongst Darwin's affects after his death - what a different book the Origin would have been if Darwin opened his mail!) Without even a rudimentary understanding of genetics, Darwin was at a loss to explain the mechanism for inheriting traits, and this caused him to water down his theory in the face of criticism in subsequent editions. So the First Edition retains the greatest clarity.<br /><br />2) The annotations in this edition do a magnificent job of putting Darwin's commentary in the proper perspective of the debates of his time, and help trace the allusions to contemporary scientific literature.<br /><br />My only criticism of this edition is that the annotator seemed reluctant to point out all the things Darwin got wrong - particularly the arguments that would disappear once the principles of genetics were rediscovered. Perhaps the annotator thought such notes would be churlish, or didn't want negative comments to detract from the overall beauty of Darwin's argument, but even something subtle like a little double-helix symbol in the margin for material that would be rejected by the New Synthesis would be beneficial to readers approaching this material for the first time. Otherwise the reader might spend too much energy trying to absorb some of Darwin's stranger ideas.
0345803485|1.0|When I heard everyone rave about this book, I decided to give it a shot. I didn't care for the sex scenes, they were pretty unrealistic, but what bothered me about them was they weren't even written well. Has this author ever written anything before? I can't believe her publisher let her release this. Not only does she use the same ridiculous phrases (\\"inner goddess\\", \\"my sex\\", etc.) over and over, she uses the actual title of the book MULTIPLE times! Can she think of nothing better to say? I've seen children's books that are more complex and with more thought put into them.<br />Some people said to me \\"yea the sex scenes are intense but the story is great\\". What story? The book repeats itself over and over and the only story is the two of them getting it on in as many ways as she will let him.<br />It is hard to believe two characters like Christian and Ana actually exist, they are not believeable at all. A self made billionaire at 27 who had to pay for sex lessons growing up? A virgin college student who let's some control freak monitor her every move? It's not complex or romantic, it's psychotic and weird, not to mention unrelatable to (I can only hope) most of the population.<br />I'm shocked that this was a best seller and I wish I could get my money (and time) back.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I LOVED the whole series. I am an avid reader and had steered away from this on the basis that BDSM is not really my thing but I was pleasantly surprised it was not a how to. The storyline is comparatively simple but I really enjoyed it. I was a little taken aback by the writing style (it is hardly literature but then as far as I am aware it is not purported to be) but the more I read the more I once again flashed back to being a young woman warring with my own rights and wrongs. I think that the nay sayers are perhaps looking for something that this book is not. This is an easy read that is pure escapism. I mean seriously - a billionaire who falls for a simple town girl (that is fantasy at its finest). This book reminds me of \\"Pretty Woman\\" where every girl wanted to be a prostitute and be found by Richard Gere. Same sort of feel but with a lot more titillation. I know that many reports have been made here in Australia whereby this book is rekindling the spice in marriages. I defy anyone to read this without wanting a bit of loving. I think it is a tremendous example of escape with a sexy edge. Definitely recommend it!!!!

Although he is not the mastermind of the engineering of Apple products, it seems he is the mastermind that drove the engineers to greatness.  I am still not finished with the book as I am a slow reader. You see don't have much time to read, I am a very busy lady.  Although I do pick up my kindle to read every chance I get.  Steve Jobs has to be the biggest bully and/or brat I have ever heard of in my whole entire life his ability manipulate others, as told in the book, was incredible.  He definitely was a mastermind of business and manipulation.  He knew how to get his way with people, within minutes of knowing someone he would find their weak spot and play on it quickly.  Am I intrigued, yes!  I'll keep reading to the end of the book.
B007SGM084|4.0|These books are well known for their sex content. It took a while to get to any actual sex in the first book and once I did, I was SO over it by the middle of the book. No erotic words are used, only clinical body parts. So lame. E.L. James is a horrible writer! She used a lot of big words in random places but was sooooooo repetitive. I read the same lines over and over and over! So annoying!! I feel like I could have written this book. Not good writing at all.<br /><br />The only reason I gave these books 4 stars is for the storyline. The story was actually interesting. There was a lot of suspense and I was actually on the edge of the seat wanting to know what was going to happen next. I started this book series for the sex but ended up reading it for the story.<br /><br />I also liked the parts of the book when the characters have conversations or little comments in their heads. It is entertaining and made me actually laugh out loud a few times.<br /><br />Ladies, there is MUCH better erotica out there, if that's what you want. DO NOT READ THIS FOR THE SEX! The first book is more about the love story, then even that get boring.<br /><br />My favorite books in order are: 2nd, 3rd, 1st.<br /><br />PLEASE don't cast any Twilight actors in the making of the movies!
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|Since the day I saw the musical version of Camelot back in the 70's I have been in love with this story, so there was a good chance that I could be disappointed by this book.  I took a chance because of all the positive reviews and I was completely lost in this well written and unexpected version.  I knew the basic pattern of the story would be the same yet I could not predict what would happen next.  This story is not your classic tale but it is a thoroughly enjoyable one with richly drawn complex characters none of which are wholy good or bad.  I loved this book from beginning to end.

Once I downloaded the software from the website, I was able to customize the mouse. I don't use all the buttons and they are easily disabled. I like the soft feel of the mouse and easy gliding and clicking. I like the features of being able to setup the mouse for different users and that it can even keep track of how many times you have clicked the buttons. Overall very happy.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Okay I got sucked in by all the hype just like everyone else.  This book is not the worst book I hae ever read but it doen't deserve more than two stars.  Why in the world is this a best seller?  Have we sunk so low intellectually that anyone would find this book appealing?  The writing is very mediocre, the sex is mediocre, the story line is mediocre.  About the only thing brilliant about this book is the agent who was able to pass this off as worthwhile.  If I had only known the agent could brainwash so many people, I could have written the damn thing, and probably done a much better job!  Bah!  Humbug!!!

I found myself deleting a number of the songs on here and some I kept simply because I really WANTED to like them.  Very disappointed and glad I got the album when Amazon was putting it for $.99 one day.  Definitely glad I didn't pay more than that.  His other albums I have LOVED.  This one leaves a lot to be desired.

I think runners and non-runners alike will enjoy reading this and be motivated to go out and run (or do something active outside).  Scott is about as hardcore as you can get as an ultra runner.  He is a fierce competitor and has an interesting story to tell. I highly recommend this to all runners.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Wasnt that great to be honest. Feel asleep trying to watch it. Ending felt a bit forced too. Don't recommend.
B00536OCZA|2.0|This is specifically for the remastered version.  Others wrote about getting poor pressings, and I am one of those.  It was good until the end of the second side.  It sounded like there was a scuff on the record, but a visual inspection shows no scratches, so it must be in the way it was made.  Secondly, there are some sonic differences from the original recording.  There was something disturbing about the cut: \\"on the run\\".  I think the problem is that there is a slight time offset between the percussion (cymbals) and the rest of the instruments.  It is really annoying.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Music has taken a turn for the worse over the past decade or so.  Occasionally there will be an artist or album who will provide a brief glimmer of hope and make us realize that all is not lost.  In 2011, that album was Adele's \\"21\\", an album of such depth, acclaim, and impact that one can only hope it will be viewed as a classic in the future.  From the thumping, blistering opener \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" to the quiet, sad closer \\"Someone Like You\\", Adele's voice--and a magnificent voice it is--take listeners through feelings of betrayal, sadness, and regret.  Songs like \\"Turning Tables\\", \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\", and \\"Rumour Has It\\" run the gamut, towering magnificently as centerpieces; Adele also throws in a nicely understated cover of The Cure's \\"Lovesong\\" for effect.  Each song, in spite of covering similar territory, is unique, has its own voice.  For fans, it makes us eager to see what Adele will do next. In the meantime, though, this album is aging nicely.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first book was okay, the second was great and the third (Mockingjay) was terrible. Most of the book is full of drugged or mental ramblings and the ending was just plain ol' blah. The book was written like the author was tired of her characters and just wanted the story to end. I agree with a previous reviewer that said the series could have had the same ending without the such an utter feeling of hopelessness. I bet that the movie will end with a very different feel.
0743201140|1.0|I bought this book brand new, to get the access code, bc I previously bought a used one (not realizing that this org hasn't come up with a method to allow people to pay to take the test online), and it DOESN'T work.<br /><br />I am thoroughly frustrated with the extra steps I've had to go through to take this test, and they haven't provided a solution for me yet.....<br /><br />I wasn't even going to give this product one star, but amazon makes you mark at least one star.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is an awsome game i have so much fun playing it i am glad the company made this game
B0072GPQ72|1.0|Great Cinema - in fact, it's actually better on mute listening to Dark Side of the Moon . . .<br />There is NO STORY here, nothing feels real or tangible.  It's a blur of fantasy and loud noises with no purpose.  I wouldn't even give it away.
B007X4N0DU|4.0|I think many people will over look this album.  It's a GREAT album.  I took a chance buying it and well it was a good choice on my part.  The album feels very well balanced and P.O.D. does a great job of bringing the So Cal sound that they're know for and some how make it feel fresh again!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great and actually pretty addicting. I like the latest updates because they make it easier to add friends. I like how it is continuously changing.

B0081TZUAW|4.0|Remember the 90s? Sure, it was the golden age of 'alternative' radio. Every mid-size city got an alternative radio station and pumped out grunge-era survivors like Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam.  Besides the patriarchs of 90s alternative, there were the lesser bands that metastasized on the scorched earth where these giants once set foot. Then, nu metal. That was the 'setting the clock back to zero' point for alternative music.<br /><br />Hello indie. Hello beards.<br /><br />There were plenty of shining stars in the 90s: Smashing Pumpkins, Beasties and NIN. There were also some real losers, like Live, Semisonic and Smashing Pumpkins. If you sifted through there were a few bands that came out of the 90s music blur that had something more to offer. For Garbage, it was Shirley Manson. The red-haired Scottish vixen led the band, which consisted of Manson and  three dorky, middle-aged uber producers, into the pantheon of radio dominance by being both fan favorites and critical darlings. They shot through the stratosphere with two great albums in a row. Filled with electronic beats, buzzsaw guitars and Manson's sugar and poison vocals and looks like a goth Raggedy Ann doll, they made music that could appeal to fans of both NIN and Pavement. The Cranberries and the Breeders. You may have locked horns over which was funnier, The Kids In The Hall or The State. But everyone could bond in a sweaty, smoke-filled arena when 'I'm Only Happy When It Rains' came pumping through the PA.<br /><br />After 2005s disappointing Bleed Like Me, the boys(and girl) in Garbage took a long hiatus. They've returned in 2012 with Not Your Kind Of People, bringing back the magic that made their self-titled and it's follow-up, the alternative 90s masterstroke Version 2.0 so great. Album opener 'Automatic Systematic Habit' gives us that grandiose bombast that made us fall in love with this band back during the Clinton administration. Manson sings \\"I wanna be your dirty little secret\\" over an electro beat and driving bass with synth lines that sound like they were pulled off of MGMTs Oracular Spectacular. 'Big Bright World' has a New Order-ish vibe(a sound that was prominent even back in Manson and company's heyday), then siren-blazing guitars come in and bring the bombast that gave bands like Evanescence a platform to completely rip off. 'Blood For Poppies' has a fuzzed out dirty guitar riff and rastafarian groove that brings M.I.As 'Paper Planes' to mind. Manson does a great job of bringing a flow to the words that let them roll right off her tongue. With a great radio ready chorus this would have been a hit in 1996 for sure.  The record is full of great poppy and fuzzed out electronic-tinged tunes, like 'Felt'. It has all the elements that makes it a quintessential Garbage song: pop hook for miles, great vocal from Ms. Manson and just enough changes to keep every verse and chorus fresh in the ears. 'Beloved Freak' closes things out on a rather melancholy and quite pretty note. Garbage always had a knack for making beautiful noise. And on this song, they make noise that's quite beautiful.<br /><br />If you were into Garbage back in their 90s glory, then you will be pleasantly surprised with this return to form album. Even if you weren't, give this record a listen and see what it means to age gracefully.secret\\" over an electro beat and driving bass with synth lines that sound like they were pulled off of MGMTs Oracular Spectacular.

1401300529|4.0|This is a very good book about a war most Americans would prefer to forget.  Yet this war stopped Russian(and I mean Russian) attempt to forceably conquer the world one small piece at a time after World War II.  Easy for me to recommened this book.
0345803485|1.0|I had read somewhere that this book and its two sequels had some connection to the twilight saga which my fourteen year old daughter is a huge fan of. I decided that for her fourteenth birthday which was last week that I would buy her this book. At her party when she opened her presents she was so happy that I had bought it for her I didn't see how anything could go wrong, then a few hours after the party she came to me in tears and told me that I had bought her an awful birthday present and when I asked her what was wrong she refused to talk to me and locked herself in her room. I decided to see what was wrong with the book and so I started reading. Well when I was finished I was outraged how dare this vulgar woman E. L. James write stories like this and aim them at children I couldn't believe it. At first I thought there was some kind of mistake and that they where actually for adults but the writing style is just too simple for that. Truly this is the beginning of the end for society, filth like this belongs in one place, the fires of hell and that is why my husband Bruce and I have organized a book burning at our local church I suggest you do the same. We must think only about the children.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I passed over this book several times, and I wish I wouldn't have! I decided to read it last night, and I was shocked at how fast I was drawn in. This book made me laugh, cry, and swoon. It was the perfect combination for a spectacular read. I tried to tell my friends why this book was so awesome and it was immposible to put it into words. It is just that good!!! When I finished reading at 2am, I decided I had to know what happened next... so I stayed up till 5:30am reading the sequel. It was 'Butterflying' amazing &lt;3

0385738773|5.0|And so, we join Thomas on the final stretch of his journey as he fears old friends and meets old enemies. The true ruthlessness of WICKED is revealed. Once again, Thomas suffers. As he battles through heartbreak, Cranks and WICKED, the lines between good and evil blur - who can he trust, and will there be a death cure?<br /><br />The final installment of the trilogy is thrilling, fast paced, heart breaking and gut wrenching. It has the reader on the edge of their seat at the danger Thomas so often faces. He has been through so much, and yet Dashner has still managed to find new challenges to throw at him. Though provoking, and excellently written, this trilogy is a must-read. To sum it up? Excellence in its purest form.
0345803485|1.0|First up, if you sold every adjective in this book you could end world hunger.<br /><br />Secondly I found it utterly impossible to care about a character who was a photocopy of one of the most unsettling portrayals of woman in the last 50 years (Yes, Bella Swan, I'm looking at you.)<br /><br />If you like the wilting-flowing type, fainting and blushing over her \\"big strong man\\", you may find something in this and Christian even has some funny snark going on but if you are more into people why don't make you want to staple them to a freight train and writing that makes the worst fan-fiction look like passable literature.<br /><br />If only Ana wasn't an airheaded nonce.<br /><br />The writing style is juvenile and oddly peppered with phases American's don't use (Yes I'm Australian but even I know they don't use \\"pram\\" and \\"rucksack\\" and the like).<br /><br />Unless EXCEEDINGLY awkward, and largely comics, sex scenes, flowery OTT descriptions and thinly painted archetypes for characters are your bag try something else.  Pretty much anything else really cause I've been reading since I was four and there are only two books that made me feel like my IQ was dropping as I read.  (This and Twilight).  It's pretty soul destroying stuff!<br /><br />If you don't like Twilight you won't like this. Everyone by now knows it's based in a Twilight fic and it just doesn't fall far from the tree.  80s Mills and Boon at it's worst with a bad case of the Mary Sues/Gary Stus.<br /><br />Best I can say?  The cover image is cool and it's fun to read aloud to your friends and laugh about.  50 Shades of Grey.  The new party game.

The change in our diet has helped my husband and I to feel better and we are starting to lose weight.  We will probably purchase the hard copy of the book so that we can look back at certain parts, for reference.  We love the message of this book and tell everyone we know about it.

0547569653|4.0|Eat and Run is a fusion of a self-admitted ultra overachiever's memoir, a cool vegan cookbook, general running tips, an inside view of a Jack Kerourac-like on-the-road lifestyle, ultra distance running tips and a look into the psychological battles of ultra distance races.  Scott Jurek comes across as an honest and complex man.  This is one of those brutally rare looks at an arcane sport, which is potentially more dangerous than you would think as an outsider. What I liked best about Eat and Run is that Jurek does not lecture you about the pros of a vegan eating regime.  What I liked the least about this book was Jurek's own account of how selfish ultra endurance athletes can be and are and his short but bitter account of his personal travails with divorcing his first wife.  I didn't see the literary value of wearing that on his sleeve in publishing that sad tale in his book.  Scott Jurek comes across as someone you would probably like to have as a neighbor but definitely not as a competitor nor as a race pacer.  I liked the book a lot for it's complexity and for the energy it describes.  Scott Jurek has done almost everything he could to improve as an ultra distance racer. That inspired me to do more as a distance cyclist.

0062197258|4.0|Into The Darkest Corner<br />By<br />Elizabeth Haynes<br /><br />My \\"in a nutshell\\" summary...<br /><br />This is the story of a relationship that gets incredibly horribly awful.  It could possibly be the story of recovery, too.  We might have to wait and see.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts after reading this book...<br /><br />Whew!  A chilling goose bumpy unputdownable thriller.  English...which just makes it so much better...tea and crisps and lots of dinners made on a cooker.  Catherine/Cathy is trying to recover from a disastrous relationship with Lee that has nearly killed her and left her damaged and with OCD.  Her attacker may soon be released from prison and the cycle of horrific abuse may begin again.  The story is sort of terrifying in that Catherine/Cathy never feels safe.  Her OCD routine is destroying her.  There may be hope when she meets her new neighbor, Stuart, a psychologist who befriends her. But things begin to unravel for Catherine/Cathy as bit by bit she feels Lee lurking...actually...more than lurking...being destructive, invasive and dangerous!<br /><br />What I loved about this book...<br /><br />The danger was extremely  scary.  Lee seemed to be everywhere.  I gasped with every turn of the page.<br /><br />What I did not love...<br /><br />I was not a fan of Catherine/Cathy.  I didn't like her lifestyle before or during Lee.  I had sympathy for her but thought she was reckless.  But that is just me...she was young...loved dancing, drinking and lots of men.<br /><br />Final thoughts...<br /><br />I found this book to be extremely  scary.There were lots of characters that I loved disliking.<br />There were tons of twists and scary bits...it would make  me think twice about dating random men!<br /><br />One last thought...<br /><br />Make sure the doors are locked and the lights are on when you read this.
0694003611|2.0|The pictures in this board book are cropped, which is just sad because the artwork is such an integral part of the story! In addition, it's very difficult to see the details such as the \\"young mouse\\" on each page.<br /><br />My mom has one of the original printings, so she's very cautious to read it to my little girl and then hide it away on a high shelf. My little girl now goes after the original book, and tries to climb the shelving, so I had to get her a new full-size hardcover edition. She reaches for this book every night before bed, leaves the antique edition alone, and ignores the board book.

Everybody make a stand, don't buy, leave a review or comment, we want real Digital copies.<br /><br />As for the movie, it's great, watched it in theaters, now I want my family to watch it so I'll have to get another way that will be much cheaper... MUCH MUCH MUCH cheaper.<br /><br />WB stop shooting yourself in the foot.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love it.  Was even willing to pay for the premium version. I especially like the radar. Doesn't use excessive resources. My only gripe is that I would like to be able to change the color of the temperature display on the notification bar.  Even better would be if I could set it to change (selectable) colors based on the temp. Anyway, it's still the best Android weather app I've seen.

B00110K62U|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this performance! I have watched it several times since purchasing it. I've always considered Colm Wilkinson to be an exceptional performer. To me, he defines the standard for Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera. I was fortunate enough to have watched him perform Phantom live in Toronto, Ontario but did not get to see him perform Les Miserables in person. The DVD is a great way to experience his performance. Get comfortable and prepare for a truly amazing experience.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|For a book that I only paid 99 cents for I did not have very high expectations going into this.  However, within the first few pages I realized how wrong I was to have set the bar so low just because of how cheap the book was. I honestly feel like I ripped the author off having paid so little for this amazing piece of work.  The story grabs you and pulls you in very quickly and you have to keep reading because you want to know what is going to happen next.  Ryan does a fantastic job of building his characters and world.  Best fantasy novel I have read in a very long time, I have recommended this novel to numerous friends and family.
1594744769|4.0|I've been wanting to read this book for awhile.  It's received so much attention that I was curious to see what it was like. I was rather uncertain at first, the swearing and dark nature of the story were not appealing to me, but I kept with the story and found that I liked it more than I had originally thought I would.<br /><br />The photographs were mind boggling in and of themselves and the way Riggs weaved them into the story was fabulous. They definitely added to the creepy atmosphere of the book. I looked at them and wondered how some of them were created. I guess photo manipulation has been around a lot longer than I've ever thought.<br /><br />I found myself empathizing with Jacob from early in the story.  The things he was struggling with would be tough for anyone, especially since he can't really explain even to himself what happened to him.  Once he ends up on the island, I found myself hoping he would find the answers he so desperately needed.  And his experiences on the island leave him having to make some difficult decisions.<br /><br />Plotwise, I can't say I've ever read another story quite like this one.  At times sympathy-inducing, other times shudder-inducing, and down right compelling, I can see why so many people enjoyed it.  However, I would be careful recommending this because of the moderate amount of swearing and the darkness and strangeness of the story.

B003Y5H5BA|1.0|Sorry guys, but as a comedy lover and sometimes writer myself this is like throwing goat cheese on an old tortilla and calling it Napolitana Pizza. Sorry. This is some of the most bogged down, uninspired \\"comedy\\" writing and directing I have seen in many years. Yes, it's that bad. There are a couple - maybe 4-5 cheap, kneejerk laughs sprinkled throughout, but the rest of the story is so unplausible, beyond ridiculous, heavy handed, bogged down, and uncreative as to wonder why the producers couldn't have nixed this one before it got out of the gate. It belongs in a septic tank or sewer. It is THAT bad. Blu ray looks and sounds great,...just wish the movie did too. P.S. I love both actors especially Jona. I like Ice Cube,...but I did not like this movie. The 3 people that also had 1.3 hrs of their life irrevocably taken with nothing in return also didn't ahem - \\"like\\" the movie. The studio needs to exert more professionalism and scrutiny with an eye towards WRITING better and DIRECTING better. There is no cure for an absence of either and no excuses. Consumers need to also exert some better judgment perhaps. OK, so word is out. Buyer beware.

0345803485|1.0|This really was one of the most poorly written books I have ever read! Did she not have a thesaurus handy? My first complaint is the abosolute over use of the word \\"murmer.\\"  I am not sure if I have murmerred (is that a word?) that many times in my whole life - let alone a few weeks.  Second complaint: what woman has that many intense orgasms?  On a similar note: how many men do you know who can have sex that much in such a short amount of time without complaining of some kind of pain or lack of performance?  Third complaint: what supposedly \\"independent and intelligent\\" woman would EVEN CONSIDER entering into such a submissive contract?  REALLY?!!!!  I couldn't believe this book was written by a woman. I would use a pen name too if I wrote so horribly.  Some first time authors are Fantastic (J.K. Rowling, Stephenie Meyer)and some are just BAD (E.L. James). I would NOT recommend this book to ANYONE!
1563890119|5.0|Gaiman is one of my favorite authors. He's a storyteller whose tales are richly embedded with analogies and philosophy, but he never jams it down your throat. He just leaves it out there for you to draw your own conclusions, or (more frequently than not) leave with more questions than ever before. The Sandman graphic novel series is among Gaiman's best, a tapestry that seamlessly weaves through theology, mythology, philosophy, and a world entirely of Gaiman's making.<br /><br />In Preludes and Nocturnes, Dream is imprisoned. When he escapes, he seeks out his three tools of power that were taken from him during his imprisonment. I won't go into the details of the story, but my favorite sections include Dream's game with Choronzon, which is far more than a battle of wits. It's a statement of Dream's outlook and his own philosophy of life. Of course, I'd be remiss to not mention the closing chapter, Sound of her Wings, which introduces us to the terminally cheerful Death. I adore her. It's hard to think of Death the same way after you meet her.<br /><br />Favorite quotes:<br />Lucifer: The million Lords of Hell stand arrayed about you. Tell us why we should let you leave? Helmet or no, you have no power here--what power have dreams in hell?<br />Dream: You say I have no power? Perhaps you speak truly. But--you say that DREAMS have no power here? Tell me, Lucifer Morningstar...ask yourselves, all of you...what power would HELL have if those here imprisoned were NOT able to DREAM of HEAVEN?<br /><br />As of the art, I actually failed art class in eighth grade. I'm the least qualified person to comment on art. That said, I'll comment anyway. The art is dark and stark, as befits the story. I think it adds rather than subtracts from the magnificent story being told.<br /><br />All in all, a great start for the Sandman series. Hang in there, it gets better.

B000002J6H|5.0|Stills' eponymous debut album is a fertile mix of southern-tinged rock, blues, pop, folk and gospel. Formerly with Buffalo Springfield and of course Crosby, Stills & Nash, Stephen scored his first solo hit with opening track (and pseudo-free love anthem) \\"Love The One You're With\\" and while it's a great song, it's just one of many highlights to be found on this very consistent album- his best I think. His collaborators are impressive- Jimi Hendrix soloing on the Louisiana-flavored rock of \\"Old Times Good Times\\", Eric Clapton featured on the bluesy \\"Go Back Home\\" and what I'd call the Laurel Canyon Chorus consisting mainly of Rita Coolidge, Priscilla Jones, John Sebastian and Stephen's band mates David Crosby and Graham Nash. `Mama Cass' Elliot joins the Chorus on \\"Sit Yourself Down\\" and the rousing closing gospel-tinged \\"We Are Not Helpless\\" (a rebuttal to Neil Young's \\"Helpless\\" from \\"Deja Vu\\"?). \\"Church (Part of Someone)\\" is the other powerful gospel song- Stephen does some mighty preaching (to the choir?) throughout the album but it feels genuine and not self-serving.<br /><br />Other favorites include the mellow folk of \\"Do For The Others\\" on which he plays all the instruments; the slightly melancholy but dazzlingly beautiful love song \\"To A Flame\\" with a lovely orchestral arrangement (dig that vibraphone!) by Stills and Arif Mardin. \\"Black Queen\\" was recorded live and it expertly channels the feel of the bayou in its blues.<br /><br />The front and back covers convey two sides of Stephen- the folk hippie and the southern cowboy. The music within is both of its time and timeless, making \\"Stephen Stills\\" an essential record in anyone's collection.<br />Oh- and I agree with the many other reviewers who think Gavin McNett is an idiot for his incredibly ignorant editorial review of this album.

B004K8WPUQ|3.0|The sound quality of this mic is fine, even from 20 - 25 feet away. The problem is with the tiny rubber shock absorbers -- if you move around a lot they squeak (on a tripod that's obviously not a problem). Because the shock absorbers are very near the mic, it WILL pick up a little noise from the shock absorbers. This can be alleviated with a little vaseline.<br /><br />My recommendation: DON'T BUY THIS MIC if you're doing much location work, moving around -- buy the new version (Rode VideoMic Pro), in which Rode fixed the shock absorber noise problem (it's a little more money but worth it).
B00729GQ0A|3.0|There is a multitude of Paranormal Romance/Urban Fantasy books out there and they can become very samey. So when an author manages to bring a new element to the genre then my interest is awaked. This is what Rebecca Hamilton has done with The Forever Girl: Sophia's Journey.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand it is well written and I liked the characters of Sophia and Charles. The pace of the story sometimes lagged with too much detail in areas that don't matter greatly to the plot, but overall the book managed to carry me from one page to the next. Where this book excelled was the world creation. Rebecca managed to breathe new life into the over used vampire mythology. I found her spin on the world of vampires, were-creature and spirits to be refreshing and intriguing. Just this aspect of the book alone makes it worth reading. I am always drawn to books that re-imagine the old familiar concepts and well worn plot hooks. The origins of supernatural beings and how they came to be in the world of man was totally new to me and one I have not come across in other stories.<br /><br />Sophia, the main protagonist, is a likable character who falls into a world of the supernatural only to find that she herself isn't as normal as she first thought. The use of Wicca is well portrayed here, Sophia cast spells and uses magic but none of it instantly moulds the world around her to her will. There is no waving of the hand and chanting that suddenly alters the laws of physics. The use of magic is more supple than that which made it more believable. It was nice to come across a female character that doesn't arm herself to the teeth and walk around slaying every vampire or monster that gets in her way.<br /><br />On the other hand there are a few down sides to this book that subtracted from the overall feel good factor. The relationship between Sophia and Charles, the obligatory love interest, seems to jump from mutual distrust to mad passionate love too quick with little to explain the sudden jump, apart from the pure physical animal attraction. The story of their growing romance, although important to the overall plot, did sometimes overwhelm the narrative. It seemed to bog the storyline down too much. But then again I believe that this would be less of an issue for readers more heavily into romantic novels. Maybe an aspect more aimed at a female readership.<br /><br />There were also a few plot hooks that just dead ended. One example of this was finding out that one of the characters was possessed by spirits and this was the reason for their aggressive actions. Why were they possessed? Who were the spirits? What were their motivations? None of this was adequately explained. In fact the characters seemed to just brush this revelation off as inconsequential.<br /><br />Even with these criticisms, which may have more to do with personal taste than quality of the story, I still enjoyed reading this book. It was well written with interesting plotlines and characters. The few issues I had would be easily remedied by a good editor and then you'd see a good book move to the realm of an excellent book.<br /><br />I can see Rebecca Hamilton's books getting better with more experience. She is defiantly an author to watch and The Forever Girl is a good starting point.<br /><br />3.5 Stars<br /><br />For more reviews of new and up coming authors visit DarkissReads.como quick with little to explain the sudden jump, apart from the pure physical animal attraction.

B002AS466O|2.0|Bruce Willis.  What a career.  I love this man, and he has showed immense range over the course of his career.  He's one of the finest actors we have ever had, and also one of the most under-appreciated.  It is for action junk like `The Last Boy Scout' that he is oft remembered and thus oft disregarded.<br /><br />This is a blandly constructed gimmicky little film that thinks it's being clever by regurgitating elements used quite often in the 90's and upping the ante by exploiting violence in a way that feels shameless and crude.  Bruce Willis plays, yet again, a PI and he is teamed with Damon Wayans (spare me) who plays an ex-quarterback.  Together they help solve a murder.  The action scenes are nicely done thanks to Tony Scott and his knack for glossy action construction, but the story is borderline bland with its lack of core excitement (everything is obviously manufactured and thus easily forgettable) and the central theme that corrodes the film's every frame is beyond off-putting, not to mention the amount of corn this film contains.<br /><br />Willis doesn't offer anything new and Wayans is just plain awful.  I know he's supposed to be comic relief, but relief would be having him offed in the film's first few frames.  Oh, and LOL at Halle Berry's involvement here.  Seriously.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|Upon ending this book, I wanted to buy 100 copies and shove it into the hands of everyone I met, imploring them to read it, NOW. It is uplifting, moving, intelligent, surprising, charming, and whole. You must read it. NOW!

0425263908|4.0|Bared to you was a good book and very similar to fifty shades of grey, so if you liked 50 shades i'd recommend it... however, bared to you became a bit repetitive on certain areas.. i think Sylvia was so focused on the exotic sexual relationship between Gideon and Eva that she missed a lot of detail and story itself.. the book goes - random writing, sex sex sex sex, random, sex sex, random, sex sex sex.. i mean, the first couple of times its fun but then it becomes too common that i kinda just skipped over it and since there was a lot of it, i skipped more pages than i would have liked to. The story of how they met and Eva's past and a sneak peak of Gideon's was good and if she would have added of that to the book i would have liked it more. She didn't reveal all of Gideon's past which is why i'd be willing to read the second but i hope the second involves more of a story than just sex writing. But overall, i don't regret reading it and i would recommend it
B007SGM084|1.0|Has Amazon not noticed that it is actually cheaper to download each individual book rather than the trilogy as a whole? Buying a \\"boxed\\" set is usually cheaper than buying the books alone; not more expensive. Plus to top it all off, the print books are cheaper than a download!!
B00782O7IY|5.0|The 2011 Academy Awards gave this film Best Picture. You can decide if it was well deserved or not.<br /><br />It's told almost entirely as a black and white silent film with what would be considered over the top facial gestures (something that was really done in those days because there was no dialogue) with brief chatter on card shots and music to emphasize the various moods. It's a throwback to the glory days of silent film but also cleverly allows the viewer to experience an \\"updated\\" silent film. It's magical, dreamlike and sometimes even glorious in certain incidents (pay attention to the main character's pet dog, Ubbie) even if the story is overly predictable. I found the choice of music scores quite impressive.<br /><br />George Valentin (Rudolph Valentino anyone?), our main character, played by actor Jean Dujardin is the ever popular charming yet arguably narcissistic lead man who refuses to accept that silent films are coming to an end. His love interest, Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo), rises to fame as a star for the \\"talkies\\" while George's own stardom falls, leading to his depression, financial ruin and then possible renewal.<br /><br />The director has called this film a \\"love letter\\" to the silent film cinema. Jean Dujardin picked up a well deserved Best Actor (you have to \\"get\\" the silent film era to understand what a splendid job he did)  and is the first French actor to receive an Academy Award in that department. Incidentally, this is the first French film to win Best Picture as well (compare this picture to the previously nominated \\"Life is Beautiful\\" picture). Berenice Bejo is the oh so pretty love interest who intends to make it big and feels herself strongly drawn to the older male lead. Also starring John Goodman (the no nonsense studio boss), Malcolm McDowell (the butler), Penelope Ann Miller (George's irritating wife) and James Cromwell (the dutiful chauffeur).<br /><br />This picture took roughly 35 days to film and was presented in the typical silent film 1:33:1 ratio. There are strong themes in this film about change and how those who don't change suffer yet those who adapt bounce back and sometimes do even better. It is also obviously a nostalgic look at an era long gone. People who enjoyed this film's focus on the loss of the silent film to \\"talkies\\" might also enjoy the 1950 \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" as well as the 1937 \\"A Star is Born\\" (which has a very similar story line to \\"The Artist\\" though more bittersweet).<br /><br />The budget for this film was only $15M yet it made over $133M at the Box Office. It garnered Best Director from the Academy Awards and was pretty much loved by almost all of the other critics and award givers.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: B plus to A minus (A to A plus for Jean Dujardin); STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus B; MUSIC/PROPER MOOD EVOKED A LA SILENT ERA: A minus;  CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.

I recommend you buy it.<br />THE ONLY THING IM MAD ABOUT IS THE MOVIE WAS BRAND NEW IN PLASTIC AND EVERYTHING AND WHEN I OPENED IT, IT WAS SCRATCED !! I WAS SHOCKED IM JUST GLAD IT DIDN'T AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THE MOVIE.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|Rated \\"R\\". Running Time: 1 hour, 38 mins.<br />This movie is a prequel to the remake movie, The Thing (1982) which was a remake of The Thing (From Another World) (1951).<br />  A Norwegian team of men are researching the Antarctic. They are using an underground scanner. Their is a strong reading. Suddenly the snow-covered ground beneath them give way under the snow vehicle and send them down a crevice. The vehicle gets stuck between the walls.<br />  Another team arrives at a base. They take Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Adam (Eric Christian Olsen) to an underground site. Their they meet Edvard (Trond Espen Seim), Karl (Carsten Bjornlund) and Juliette (Kim Bubbs). They show them where a UFO was discovered.  Then Kate and Adam are taken to the hole the other team had fallen through. Under the ice surface, they see a creature frozen in the ice. They believe came from the UFO.<br /> Thy take the creature, encased in a block of ice, back to the base. The doctor uses a drill into the ice to get a sample of tissue from the creature.<br /> Later,  Derek (Adewale Akinnuoye-Aghaje) goes into the room alone to look at the block of ice. As the ice is melting, he is getting a better view of the creature. The creature is huge.  Suddenly, the creature blasts through the ice and goes through the ceiling.<br />  Now outside, the creature is hiding. It is hungry. it has killed a dog and now it is after fresh human meat.<br />  This Thing is going to stay around until it gets every human to munch on. The Thing can also transform itself into another human.<br /><br /> Also in the cast: Joel Edgerton, Ulrich Thomsen, Paul Braunstein, Jorgen Langhelle, Jan Gunner Roise, Stig Henrik Hoff.<br /><br /> Perfect prequel to the remake movie, [[ASIN:B001CW7ZWG The Thing  [Blu-ray]]] (1982) starring Kurt Russell.<br /><br /> The end of this movie is perfect so that when you pop in the DVD for The Thing (1982), the story continues.<br /><br /> Sets, props and other special effects from the 1982 movie have been re-created.<br /><br /> In all honesty, this 2011 movie is so much better than what John Carpenter created in 1982.<br /><br /> The original movie is [[ASIN:B00009NHC0 The Thing from Another World]] (1951). James Arness (Gunsmoke) played The Thing.1982 movie have been re-created.<br /><br /> In all honesty, this 2011 movie is so much better than what John Carpenter created in 1982.<br /><br /> The original movie is [[ASIN:B00009NHC0 The Thing from Another World]] (1951).

B005LBN7WQ|5.0|Among boy bands, Westlife was the rare one that survived to adulthood. Formed in 1998, they eventually disbanded in 2012. Their voices matured, but their music stayed as soulful and compelling as ever. The \\"Greatest Hit\\" set is a fantastic value for money--2 CDs and a DVD of their top music videos--and includes their early top hits as well as some of the latest music. \\"Flying Without Wings\\" remains my favorite, but \\"Beautiful World\\" runs a close second. Westlife had previously released a \\"Greatest Hit\\" album but this is their newest, and the most complete. It's a great introduction to Westlife, and if you've always been a fan, it's a wonderful way to keep their music close even as we bid them adieu.

034580404X|5.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy is an excellent escape for women. The story reminds us that we are more than mothers and wives. Grey starts off with a rough character, but eventually the story line leads the reader to why Grey is how he is and how love for a woman opened his heart to healing.  The reader needs to have all three books to understand the storyline, which is fine since the reader will love the books and want to read more. Even when the reader reads the last words in the last book, we are still wanting more. You do not need to partake of the particilar activities, to lose yourself in the story.
B001TW69J4|5.0|I had never heard of this amazing band until I saw them open for thrice on their farewell tour.  I was blown away by the craftsmanship of each song and how tight the bank played together.  This album is a must have if you love music in general.
B000K7VHPU|4.0|I have seen this movie when it was on one of the movie channels and it was very good.  I purchashed his movie for my bestfriend for her birthday in June. This is one of her all time favorite movies. In fact, she watched it the night I received it in the mail. She plans on watching it over and over.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I LOVED this story!  I don't know why it took me this long to read this, since I bought it a while ago.  People kept asking me if I had read it yet, and I kept putting it off.  Once I started reading, the story just grabbed me and didn't let go until I reached the end!<br /><br />Travis and Abby's relationship is like watching a train wreck happening right before your eyes!  They are so wrong for each other, and yet, you cheer them on hoping they will be OK by the end.  I laughed, cried, and felt the frustration and emotions these two went through.  The story is told in Abby's POV.  She is a strong heroine, a survivor, and is not afraid to make painful choices.  Travis Maddox is one of the most well-written, temperamental characters I've ever come across.  He is relentless, a hothead, but he is also loyal to the people closest to him.  I just love Travis!  I can't wait for Walking Disaster, this story told in Travis' POV!!!<br /><br />Favorite LOL moment:  The scene where I had the song (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction by The Rolling Stones playing in my head all night! :)<br /><br />I could kick myself for not reading this sooner, but now that I have, I highly recommend!!!

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Since I received my Kindle as a gift two years ago my choice of reading material has expanded.  I have read many of the better know Fantasy authors.  I have not read anything better than this book.  The characters are very well developed. The story is so interesting and well presented. While there were a few times \\"to\\" was used when \\"too\\" was appropriate I would not say these small errors detracted from my enjoyment of the story at all. I predict this author will become well known and his future endeavors will be priced accordingly.  My suggestion is that anyone who has not read this book grab it at the current great price and sit down for a great read.

1594202842|5.0|I was very skeptical about the book. I've read reviews and was curious, but not in a very positive way. When my twins where born a friend gave this book to me as a present. \\"Interesting...\\" - I thought to myself.<br /><br />I grew up in Russia.  I studied piano.  My parents would often tell (or scream at) me: \\"You will thank us later! No, you are NOT going on this class trip / to a play date / a sleepover, etc.) You are staying home and preparing for the concert! You have to practice piano / go to the music school (4 times a week!)\\" \\"NO! I will NEVER thank you!\\"<br />But I DO!<br /><br />Once I came back from a camping trip (I was exhausted, though over myself with joy. Again, my parents never allowed me on trips like that - but this one was a mandatory trip - for geology class, we got graded). It was amazing and fun. I arrived home at 7.30 pm, covered in mud and scratches, longing for a shower, hot cup of tea and a good night sleep. The minute I walked in, my mom said that my piano teacher called and we have to go to the music school. \\"When?\\"- Now. - \\"NOW? I CANNOT DO IT NOW! NO!\\"  Besides everything else, the Music school is an hour away! \\"Yes, your piano teacher managed to book the concert hall for practicing before the recital, 9:30pm - 10:30 pm.\\" Can you imagine how many parents would do that?<br /><br /> My parents were the ones who made me practice piano: teachers said I had talent - and the family had to enforce my discipline. My parents worked hard on making this happen - I studied music, I love music, I teach and work with choirs, I LOVE it.  My parents would also say about others: \\"Oh, Anna's parents gave her a choice? \\"CHOICE!?\\" What did she choose? - they'd ask angrily or sarcastically - NOT to play piano?!  That's not a choice, that's lazy parents for whom it is easier let the child run around all day long, instead of raising that child well.\\"<br /><br />I think, every culture has variety of parents.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book though to every parent who wants his/her child to play an instrument, to understand the kind of commitment it requires.  You don't have to be a \\"tiger mother\\", just don't expect much progress from your child if he/she  takes one lesson a week for about 45 minutes and practices almost daily for 15 - 20 minutes. Also, don't expect any progress at all if she practices even less.<br /><br />Thank you for writing this book!to every parent who wants his/her child to play an instrument, to understand the kind of commitment it requires.

B0002KZAKS|1.0|Bought this microphone many months ago in March because I was starting a project with some friends that required voice recordings. When it arrived it had no cables to attach it to anything (not even an XLR to XLR), and looked almost nothing like the preview image (it was black and the head was smaller than displayed). I went to Radioshack and bought an XLR to USB connector as a quick fix. The microphone picked up very little sound unless I was practically making out with it, but it was manageable. I thought it was a problem with the cable (Radioshack is not exactly grade A) and left it at that.<br /><br />Flash forward to July. I finally have stable income again and buy a professional XLR to 3.5mm audio-in connector, assuming the mic will pick up more sound with a better connection. Turns out, the mic just doesn't pick up sound at all, regardless of what you connect it with. Attempted every means I had available to increase the recording volume, but it just can't pick up anything outside of a very small radius (think one cm from the mic at most) and increasing the gain causes it to record nothing but static and popping sounds. Very disappointed, and now I can't return it. AVOID.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|ok so you connect dots a nd find ways to fill in the square big deal ....... OVECORSE ITS A BIG DEAL I love this game and you should too
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I can't believe there are 22 1 star reviews for this film. I've been going through a lot of comedy recently, but they did so much with this movie that this was my favourite of the year. Tatum was surprisingly excellent, and Jonah Hill was brilliant as always.<br />If you like movies like Anchorman, The 40 Year Old Virgin, and Superbad, you should love this. Absolutely loved it, and I'm glad I didn't read anything about it before watching it.<br />Highly recommend it!
B00846F1YW|4.0|l love these games but have the same issues with it as I've had on other reviews of this kind.  It is when you hit the 'hint&quot; button because of all the glittering stars marking the response does not stay up long enough for me to find.  If that could be fixed all the games I play by this maker would get 5plus stars by me!!!!!!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|it is ok but, your just  hitting all the birds. the space one was better. the 0.99 was worth it.
030758836X|4.0|The writing in the beginning of this book sparkled for me. The back stories of Mizzoura Nick and NYC slick Amy were fun and believable. Amy's disappearance drove the narrative from the first word. Where the story fell apart was with Amy's \\"fake diary\\" which felt like a cheap trick. Amy meant to fool the police with it, but it fooled me too. And the book's ending is a bummer.<br /><br />This book would have been stronger if told only from Nick's POV. I read and enjoyed another book by this author, but also found its ending disappointing because as in GIRL GONE, an innocent person is punished.
1608871045|3.0|Purchased this book recently and although it's a fun collection and book for fans, with many files, blueprints, etc, the novelty becomes uninteresting fast. The blueprints are very basic, probably the most interesting thing is the stickers and the joker cards, but for the price it seems to have alot of filler and not alot of new info. The book is also very delicate, with some pages of my book seemingly glued too much, with pictures and pages bent or torn. So the book for me is okay, but I still feel they could have done better. Very little on the new film, almost nothing on Bane or the new Batcave, you will find more on the new movie on the net.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|after a while in the caurosel it says no image. it will be a 5 star app once that's fixed. please fix it
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I loved the first movie, thought the acting and the action sequences were great.  This movie improves on the first, great movie definitely a must see if you enjoyed the first movie!
0143119680|1.0|How can anyone read this romance/supernatural bandwagon tripe??  It is so laden with every wicca and vampire cliche that it is absolutely pathetic.  And completely inaccurate in its portrayal of witchcraft. A sad sorry waste of time and money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is addictive once you begin you want more, i love playing it in my kindle fire!  it challenges you because in order to have all the games you have to win the others!
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I love this app. working 16 hour alternating shifts, its easy to lose track of the days. this helps greatly in remembering what to pay and when.
1451626657|5.0|I first read this book in 1962 as a 20 year old. I loved it, was transformed by it. Years later I would periodically re-read it and fall in love all over again with Heller's prose, his unmistakable characters,and his profound truths about war and human nature. All this served up with a rich language and zany characters. I just re-read it yet again now, 50 years later, and found more to discuss and ponder evan all these readings later. The rich and rewarding experience of reading \\"Catch-22\\" is a gift to all who experience it.
0143034901|5.0|Nicely written book. The translation to English is very good, the words flow nicely. However, if you can read Spanish, then get the original version \\"La Sombra del Viento\\".
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I don't normally rate apps, but after playing 10+ rounds in a row I noticed I was playing it more than 90% of all the other free apps I try.  Simple, fast games. Worth a download...
0345803485|1.0|Simply put this book is terrible. The story had potential, but the writing massacred it. If I read the words \\"ghost of a smile\\", \\"oh my\\", or \\"inner goddess\\" again I'm going to waterboard myself. As mentioned the idea behind the book had potential; and even if you can get past the elementary writing, you would have to believe a woman (whose character is poorly developed) is as naive as Anastasia Steele. Any of the little development her character makes contradicts itself throughout the book. I really can go on forever about how this book is most likely worse than \\"Snookies\\" auto-biography, but I will sum it up with this - A story with this level of writing that fails to stimulate anything but my gag reflex belongs in the trash can not on best sellers list. Authors around the world must be palm slapping their heads.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a classic romance novel with a bit of &#34;freak&#34; thrown in. Aside from the kinky, many of us can relate to this relationship. We all have issues that hold us back in relationships but that is what defines us as individuals. This book is a very good read and keeps your interest. You WANT to know what happens. If you dont like love stories then don't read and keep your nasty opinions to yourself! Well done Ms. James. Great story line!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has valued resources and uses.  I like that words are defined as you are reading if you click the symbol.
B001L51RQE|2.0|Basically the 3-star-and-less reviews are right.  I bought this for a couple of bucks just to see, and:<br /><br />1) Yes it's mastered so loud as to be unlistenable after a couple of songs.  Instant ear fatigue.  Terrible.  Someone could probably make a lot of money selling a peak-restoring processor the way things are going....<br /><br />2) It's too disjointed.  They go from inspired/locked in grooving (IMO at least) to WTF too many times.  Synchronicity II is a good example - the jump into Andy's wailing is jarring and you can hardly tell what he's even thinking (cf Disc 2 of The Police \\"Live!\\" CD, incredible).  It basically makes it too hard to get into.  I know they've always acknowledged being incredibly underrehearsed, but not getting the changes that make a song is not acceptable.<br /><br />3) The overall take is that there are times in a band's career when they are locked in, and after that it's often forced.  Seems this happens easily as bands age...it just happens.  They aren't 20 anymore (in spirit that is, I know they are actually quite apart in age) and the material isn't fresh.  I'd say a good, and fair, assessment would be, if you can handle the inconsistencies (and, without being too harsh about it, are deaf to the loudness problems), you'll enjoy this quite a bit - good thorough setlist, more solid playing than not.  But if you are more...discerning...it's more easy to understand how it's so easy to find for 2 bucks....
B007SYWFRM|5.0|much better game w/many new enhancements including several ways to get free acorns!!!!  also ways to earn free hearts to get free items in the store which is done w/friends....but in a very<br /> cool way.  ;  )
B007V508CC|5.0|I expected this to be a good album and it is. I like that there is a good variety of the styles of songs on here. One thing I find kinda funny though is the use of \\"Oh\\" and \\"ooooh\\" so much on the album. Definitely not a complaint. Just something I noticed.
0345803485|1.0|By the time I had read 50 pages, I was so annoyed at the shallow illiterate heroine who is not naive but clueless and reckless that it was hard for me to continue.<br /><br />This girl is not bright, has a very superficial outlook on everything, and has little experience with the rich tapestry of humanity, as well as a vocabulary of a ten yr old.<br /><br />When other reviewers say this book sounds like it was written by a teenager, that teen would be a very ignorant one with no literary skill.<br /><br />I have read many Harlequins and old Gothic fiction that are far more interesting than these people, and really more believable. The 1970s bodice rippers should be used for romantic research next time Ms James.<br /><br />Unless you are very gullible, have a Valley Girl vocabulary and can suspend disbelief indefinitely this book will annoy you. a billionaire with a British grammatical penchant and a reckless bimbo embarking on a journey of pain and bondage is just silly.<br /><br />Real life is far more interesting despite having many fewer billionaires.<br /><br />Laurie McBain' Moonstruck Madness. Now there's a story. But no billionaire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game and it worth it and you like fun games then this is for youand I hope you have fun becuz I did

B007JMW46U|4.0|Sherlock Holmes short stories are very nice. Easy to read, simple and interesting problem solving skills, nice if you are a logic thought oriented person and you are looking for a quick read.
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|I liked the beginning and very end , the guy who played the Phantom was great, but I was disappointed that Weber did not carry the same love story theme from the original play and the 2004 movie , I would like to have seen him pick another opera house , but Coney Island NY ,  give me a break !!!!
B0062QRTKA|5.0|If I had to compare \\"Open Sea!\\" to other games, the one that comes to mind first is Frogger, although the gameplay is very different. In Open Sea, you're trying to get Mo's people, a disparate lot if there ever was one, across numerous crossings of the sea (on the overhead map, the crossings actually look like river crossings) without drowning them or letting them fall prey to their enemies. It's not quite as easy as the graphic tutorial makes it look. After a few crossings, I had to take a break from the constant swiping required to hold the waves back. It got a little easier once I was able to use lightning bolts, but it was still very challenging.<br /><br />I've still got a long way to go to reach the Promised Land, but the game is so addicting that I'll probably stay with it for as long as it takes. My hat is off to the developers for a very original new game. It's silly and cute enough for kids, and it's challenging enough to appeal to grown-ups.
B000JIHP88|2.0|Pros: The songs are soothing, you can choose a combo of lights/music/both, there is an option for white noise (forest noises), remote control, 2 volume settings<br /><br />Cons: To attach the mobile to the crib, there is a long peg that comes out the back of the music box part and then a plastic washer that is supposed to be screwed onto it. The tension is not enough to hold up the mobile portion-it immediately tipped forward. Rather than return it, we just secured the mobile by tying a strap from the bottom of the mobile pole to the peg. This is a pretty major design flaw, which is why I don't think the full retail price is fair.<br /><br />I was able to buy this on sale for less than $30 and that seemed a fairer price.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|If you loved first three Pie movies, you will no doubt love this one too. You know what you're getting into going into these movies-the usual sexual driven dialogue and antics with splashes of hilariousness-but ultimately it manages some heart. I loved how EVERYONE from the original came back. Here's hoping for American Retirement in 20 years!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works flawlessly and gives you all the info you'd expect from a weather app and more.  The interface is very easy to use.  I'm going to check and see if they have a version for my laptop.

B001B7CNXI|4.0|I bought the movie to have access to the offshore race boat scenes and Sonny piloting the Cat to Cuba! Outstanding as was the soundtrack!
034580404X|4.0|I really enjoyed the books. There was so much hype about the series I decided to read it. The first book hooks you with the shock-n-awe. It gets a little slow toward the later part of the book but ends with you wanting to read more. The second book was my favorite. It had so much happening and was such a great love story. I couldn't put it down once I started it. The third book was predictable but still an enjoyable read. I could read this series over & over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the Kindle format--worked great and the story line prohibited me from setting the book down!  Finished it in 2 days.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it because I can do so many things I can expand my village and visit villages and invite people!
B0036WC890|4.0|\\"Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail Or Survive\\" by Jared Diamond is the follow-up to his excellent \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies\\".  Published in 2005, after an eight year gap, Diamond discusses how this book is using the same comparative method to understanding the end of societies, that the previous work applied to the creation of societies.<br /><br />While I didn't find this book as absorbing as his previous work, there is still a lot to recommend \\"Collapse\\" to readers who are interested in history, sociology, or various other areas of humanities.  Diamond puts forward the idea that the causes of societal collapse in the past have been attributed to one or more of eight factors:  (\\"deforestation and habitat destruction, soil problems (erosion, salinization, and soil fertility losses), water management problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of introduced species on native species, human population growth, and increased per-capita impact of people.\\"  To these he adds four more as dangers to modern societies.  These include: \\"human-caused climate change, buildup of toxic chemicals in the environment, energy shortages, and full human utilization of the Earth's photosynthetic capacity.\\"  While it is easy to agree with these, it doesn't have to be human-caused for climate change to have a negative impact on a society.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts, the first being a relatively short discussion of the environment in Montana, chosen because of Diamond's personal experience with the area, as discussed in this section.  As he does throughout the rest of the book, he discusses which of the twelve factors he are potential problems for that area of the country.<br /><br />Part two covers past societies which have \\"collapsed\\".  In this section Diamond looks at the Greenland Norse, Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, the Anasazi, and the Maya.  Diamond also looks at three past societies which were successes, such as Tikopia, centralNew Guinea, and the forest management during the Tokugawa-era in Japan.  There is a bit of controversy regarding Diamond's discussion of Easter Island where critics point out that there were factors such as disease (brought from Europe), slave raiding, and animals introduced into the environment that contributed to the decline of the society and the loss of the native trees and plants and not simply the society that was there that deforested the island.<br /><br />Part three looks at current societies which are in danger of causing their own collapse.  These include Rwanda, where he looks at overpopulation; Haiti, especially when compared to the relative success of neighboring Dominican Republic; China as a developing nation; and Australia as an industrial developed nation, and in particular the effect of mining.<br /><br />Part four is titled \\"Practical Lessons\\" and here Diamond looks at why societies make decisions that lead to disaster.  He then looks at business, and how some businesses avoided their environmental responsibilities, and how some are now doing the right thing.  He then concludes with a summary of the most serious problems we have, and what will happen if we don't solve them, but he also gives us some reasons to hope.<br /><br />\\"Collapse\\" is very readable, and though it doesn't match his best, that is not a particularly severe criticism.  Nor is it surprising when dealing with the subject of why societies collapse that there may be controversy in some of the proposed conclusions.  What is important is that the author present their case in a reasonable and logical fashion, and Jared Diamond does that very well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Since this app uses no Wi-Fi except for multiplayer, you can play it anywhere.  When you close out the game it saves it so when you re-open the app you are right where you left off in the game.
B000KUD2G4|5.0|Carefully opened the packaging fully expecting to have to box it back up and send back...I just didn't believe it was gonna work.  Hooked it up and was amazed!  My application was two guitar amps hooked up in a stereo config.  I was most likely suffering from a ground loop problem.  The HD400 took care of the problem perfectly...I went from annoying loud hum to dead silence.  One of the best $29 bucks I've spent in my studio.  I'm sitting here right now with both amps on in my guitar room and I'm in total awe of what I'm not hearing!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|so I love this game it does not freeze it works just fine I like the fact you can get acorns eaisly and the cute animals give lots of money and I have 45.789$ and its super easey and addictive so I recamend this game do to the fun and creative ways the maker of this game put out and please take my review and follow it by downloading this game
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Saw the new A&E tv show and decided to read the first book.  Characters are great and he develops them in a slow thoughtful manner.  A good understanding of Native American culture present and past and weaves this into the story line very nicely.  Sometimes the dialogue is a little confusing and the long paragraph breaks are a mystery the plot flows right along.  What a great character Henry is!
B0086700CM|4.0|I like the game although I suck at it. I can't play it for more than 5 tries at a time but I always go back to it.
0307592731|5.0|I'm not usually a reader of memoirs, am much more of a fiction gal, but I loved Cheryl Strayed's novel TORCH, so I read WILD, and I am so glad I did. WILD reminds me why I read: to be connected to other people, to think perhaps my own experiences had/ have value, to be part of universal experience larger than myself. Plus, it's poignant and funny. Do yourself a favor and read this memoir.<br /><br />What I find dismaying: the tone of many of WILD's reviews. It's disturbing how judgmental so many people are, focusing on  Strayed's early experimentation with sex and drugs as if this somehow damned her, rather than seeing it as symptomatic of a flailing young woman's utter despair. The real tragedy here, besides the death of Strayed's mother when both the author and her mother were so young, is the lack of support and structure Strayed had in the days before AND after her mother's death. That's what makes this all painful. Have people never turned to extreme measures in the absence of healthy tools in an effort to soothe themselves? Especially when they were younger? Before they knew better?  Why all this rotten-tomato-throwing at honesty? I hope these readers don't live in glass greenhouses.<br /><br />Jeesh.  Get a grip, folks.

B008JGSM6G|3.0|This app is fun at first, but then it seems like all the levels are the same. The only thing that changes is the size of the grid.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|The Innocent was a surprisingly poor piece of work.  I read over 200 books per year, the majority of which are in the same genre as this novel.  Baldacci generally writes excellent stories, with smart & likeable characters, and compelling plots.  This is NOT one of them.<br /><br />I felt that Robie was a lazily created protagonist - he's absurdly inconsistent as a character, an amateur assassin who makes naive errors and completely veers off course.  I'm surprised by Baldacci in delivering such a weak main character!<br /><br />Julie was unrealistic and seemed to lack a single likeable attribute.  Did Baldacci's agent pressure him to try and reach a new demographic with this young character?  If so, very little time and effort was put into her, as Julie's essentially written as a bitter adult.  The majority of her dialogue was totally uncharacteristic of any young teenager...even child prodigies, as they claimed she was (lazy).  More likely, Julie was just added to hastily build up this overly complex and unnecessary plot line, which leads me to...<br /><br />Spoiler alert: We're supposed to believe the President's assassination attempt was the result of decades of planning?  You've got to be kidding me!  But wait - when Talal, the mastermind behind this plan, is almost killed by Robie (the world's best hitman...until he botched this one, of course), he proceeds to take countless risks in order to avenge the attempt.  Talal completely throws a wrench into this massive plot to kill the President, just so he can mess with Robie?  FYI: this plan includes multiple scenes where the terrorists purposely do NOT kill Robie.<br /><br />Boy, I could go on and on about this book (don't get be started on Vince or Annie!). I read bad books all the time; that's OK, because often they are not written by renowned authors.  However, I feel it's extremely disappointing when someone like Baldacci delivers a book like this to the public.
B00884GR0W|3.0|this is a fun substitute for Minecraft but it crashes constantly and lags and had quite a few glitches but hopefully they will soon fix this great game
B008JDAC7G|5.0|just a simple and fun game with clean graphics and great sound.  be careful though you will waste a lot of time!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|No it's not a great book series, but it is addicting and entertaining.  I read all 3 books in very little time.  The good thing about reading these books on a Kindle is that you can highlight the \\"high lights\\" and then re-read them later.  I will see the movie when it comes out, as I'm curious to see who will play the leads, how they will be played and how sexual the movie will be.  I'm intrigued to see what it will be rated.
B007P4OTHO|2.0|There are some great tracks on this LP. But, I bought this for the 5.1 surround disc. If you are thinking of buying it for the surround mix, do not. It's just not done well. The low end is gutted. Stray sounds appear randomly from different speakers for no reason. Vocal levels are all over the place. You'll never listen to this 5.1 disc.
B0074MZSPO|5.0|this album has alot of soul and power from the vocals its like janis joplin meets band of horses and they have a baby and its alabama shakes solid album very well done for a debut album hope to hear from this band in the future so good
0345803485|1.0|Pain, dominance, humiliation, and bondage presented as pleasure? Fornication packaged in paperback for women lacking discretion? Warning: Sin lurks in the heart.

B005IEGUDY|5.0|AS A HISTORY TEACHER, I ENJOY READING BOOKS WITH A MICHNER QUALITY TO THEM. THE CAPIVATING STORIES IN THIS WORK ARE WOVEN THROUGH HISTORY WITH VERY BELIEVABLE CHARACTERS AND POSSIBLE THEORIES AS TO HOW THESE EVENTS HAPPENED WHEN THRERE IS NO WRITTEN EVIDENCE. IT IS WELL RESEARCHED AND MOVES ALONG; KEEPING A PAGE TURNER INTEREST AS YOU READ. IT IS A REAL PLEASURE READ FOR ME AS I OFTEN READ DOCUMENTARIES AND THIS BOOK IS A VACATION. HIGH RECOMMENDATION FOR HISTORY BUFFS.
B000BYKAQE|4.0|I picked up this album recently on CD to complete a Graham Nash compiliation I was working on.  I needed \\"Earth and Sky\\" and a few other songs (at least that's what I believed at the beginning).<br /><br />After listening a couple of times, I couldn't find anything to leave off of the compilation.  This is an excellent mid-period Graham Nash album, far better than anyone would have a right to expect when recalling the vicious and hateful \\"Rolling Stone\\" review of the album circa 1980.<br /><br />I've long since discounted \\"Rolling Stone\\" reviews as the magazine has lost all credibility with me, due in part to its harsh review of albums as excellent as \\"Earth and Sky\\".  I can also recall the magazine panning \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"Byrds\\" with a like-minded viciousness.  Now, they call \\"Exile\\" one of Stones best albums.  Alas, their \\"Byrds\\" review was taken to heart by the band and there were no further serious attempts at a full reunion.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that the latter-day Byrds, the latter day Stones and the latter day Graham Nash were ridiculed by Rolling Stone but any and all releases by the tone-deaf shrieker Yoko Ono never failed to merit less than a five-star review from them.  So much for their stellar reputation for astute record reviews.<br /><br />Quite frankly, Rolling Stone isn't worth the paper it's printed on.<br /><br />But Graham Nash's \\"Earth and Sky\\" is well worth buying.  Every song is good; he obviously devoted a great deal of effort to it, in the writing, the arrangements, the production and in choosing the supporting cast of excellent players.  In my view, \\"Earth and Sky\\" compares favorably with \\"Songs for Beginners\\", \\"Wild Tales\\" and \\"Songs for Survivors\\".  And it's head and shoulders better than Nash's next album, \\"Innocent Eyes\\" and the vast majority of Neil Young's post 1974 releases.<br /><br />Nash fans should give it a listen.  It deserves to be as available as the rest of the vast CSNY catalogue (which is mostlyhit and miss).  This one's a hit!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|How wonderful to have such an application always at  arm's reach.  I cannot believe the number of translations available and the option of listening to God's Word is just awesome.  Thank you so much for sharing this FREE app.  God will surely bless you.
0307744434|2.0|My kids who are seven and ten, loved this story, I am forty-four and didn't.  We listened to the audio book version read by Jim Dale who we all adore.  (My daughter and I think Jim Dale could make reading a car manual sound good.)<br /><br />Morgenstern includes a lot of details about the physical features of the Night Circus but doesn't focus the same kind of effort developing the characters she creates.  I really wanted to love this, it could have been fantastic but I like a story to go with my details and having one without the other is never satisfying to me.
0061729078|3.0|Great author. I must recognize it wasn't what i expected. Huxley portraits the very first time he tripped on mescaline. a detailed description of his experience is made, what and how he felt, saw and heard, under the drug effects. what is most fascinating about the book its the continuous reference to art, as the author encounters himself in a sort of art gallery. he describes famous pieces under \\"enhanced\\" perception. i found it amazing to contrast his description by viewing the paintings online while reading.<br />thou i hoped to find more analysis on perception and consciousness, huxleys delightful  writing caught my attention at every moment.<br />what i don't know is why he used this title as it is the name given to a poem by william blake. also used by jim morrison for naming the band. i think in those days every one was too high to come up with original names and titles. haha just kidding.<br />any way great book, if you're into huxley i recommend you read a happy world too.
B000063UR2|5.0|This movie was by far the best movie of its era, not many liked it at first when it came out in theaters and on cassette. But after awhile when people began to watch it over and over again they started to really enjoy this colorful fantasy film. This is the kind of film that people need to sum times watch over and over again to see how amazing it is. Excellent acting too.
0345803485|2.0|They are horribly written and repetitive books! There is like no story at all, all it is just sex and that gets so old! Anyone who is curious about these books just don't read them they are a waste of time.
B0086700CM|5.0|Everything works fine with the game it has no bugs or whatever.  I don't know what's with these stupid 1 star reviews
030758836X|2.0|J. Moore - My thoughts exactly.  I finished this book feeling downright depressed.  The book was filled with so many twists and turns, but then the ending was as though the author had painted herself into a corner and had nowhere to go.  So she had a deadline, and she just ended it.  Such a disappointing ending! No resolution, just a pathetic attempt at a \\"last word\\".  I feel ripped off, too because this Kindle download was rather expensive.  And now that I've finished it, I can't delete it from my library fast enough.<br /><br />I gave this book two stars because the twists throughout the book kept me reading.  But ultimately,  it was just too disturbing and depressing for my taste.
0975991477|4.0|I found this book very informative.  It talks about how we receive information and how our brain changes in the process.  The first time we receive info we filter it based on what we have already experienced.  Second time we let down are guard and receive more with less filters.  We need to read something or hear something at least 3 times for us to really receive the information and therefore have a change in the brain which we may call learning.  The book can be a bit technical and not for the average reader but does have some very good information.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Makes all access to my files seamless.  Also have 20 GB's for free! ...I don't know what else to say
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really enjoyed the twists and turns of the first and second books. However I felt that this book dragged on. When things of interest finally did begin to happen 3/4 of the way through, they seems rushed to finish and tie up all the loose ends to end the book. I wasn't happy with how the story ended because I felt the author just gave the readers what they wanted without any explanation of how they got there. I like the hunger game trilogy but I'm still left with questions of how the characters got from point T to Z.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Great game!  Fantastic graphic.  Challenging.  Had to re-install once though.  This is one of the better game on the market right now.  What you need to do to solve the puzzle and make the story progress actually makes sense.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|The playing area overlaps the screen to the right, rendering it unplayable. shame, it looked like it could have been fun.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I actually paid money for this.  Where you need to go and do is so random that it's beyond logic.  It's a hidden object game with different search sessions taking place in the same environment over and over again.  That is just laziness in the developer's part and the aimless wondering around solely to drag out the game.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used this app everyday, and it's been more accurate then the local weatherman. I like that I am able to change my locations to anywhere I may be traveling. I also like the hourly temps. Overall it's a very good app.
0345803485|4.0|Im probably the last one out there who hadn't read this series, so when I was getting ready for a three week vacation, I decided to bring these books along. I agree with many of the negative reviews, this book was poorly written, and by the end of the third book I was tired of reading about Christian and Ana's sex.

0345803507|3.0|Im probably the last one out there who hadn't read this series, so when I was getting ready for a three week vacation, I decided to bring these books along. I agree with many of the negative reviews, this book was poorly written, and by the end of the third book I was tired of reading about Christian and Ana's sex. But the story, the love, the passion, was highly addictive. I needed to read all three. Is this book going to show up on a classics list in 25 years time, I hope not.

B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I just purchased this with the [[ASIN:B006LFVKES Transcend 16GB UHS SD Card]] in lieu of ordering a proper SSD ExpressCard so as to seriously upgrade my ThinkPad R52's capabilities.<br /><br />If you're looking to make it 54mm width and flush, I might suggest the [[ASIN:B007UR1PIC StarTech ExpressCard 34mm to 54mm Stabilizer Adapter]] over [[ASIN:B002GHTIRQ StarTech's first generation stabiliser]]. While a bit spendy, the ability to have 2 available for other uses makes the investment worthwhile in my opinion.  This reader does not require the stabiliser for the ThinkPad R52 at all, but my desire to keep it permanently installed made the decision one of aesthetics.<br /><br />The clampack that this came in is utterly awesome!

B008K8U13K|3.0|I enjoy the game. it's a nice classic 2d sonic game with new style to it. I would love this if on my kindle fire I could control it. sonic is mostly ducking as my large thumb hit what should be a forward button on a small directional circle. please update with a larger directional circle and forward/back/right/left directions and not this turned weird diagonal up-right/down-right/down-left/up-left junk!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|the tiles are sloppy and there's no button to see which tiles are free like on mahjongg artifacts which is a totally awesome game.

0743454537|1.0|When we readers begin a book, we expect the author to put the main character in at least one difficult situation and work her way out. The ending of this book is a cop-out. Picoult took the easy way out and lost some readers' respect and readership. That was the last book of hers I ever read. The term for this not-respected plot device Is \\"deus ex machina,\\" which implies a lack of imagination on the author's part.  Ms. Picoult apparently couldn't figure out a way for her protagonist to work her way through the plot's challenges via the protaganist's brains or sheer guts.  Ms. Picoult could have and should have done better.<br /><br />This book reads like she had a deadline to meet, so she went for a quick, coincidental ending to the disservice and annoyance of some of her readers. Too bad. She seems to get her story ideas from the newspaper and then sensationalizes them.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|I am U.S. Army enlisted Soldier and I bought the Zoom to hopefully remedy my Kinect's \\"space issue\\" inside my barracks room.<br /><br />  The installation was easy and it included warning signs everywhere so that you do not damage your Kinect (I saw several reviews about damaged equipment but rest assured if you follow the warnings and instructions this will not be an issue). I had no issues with the Kinect setup, the calibration (using that card with the face on it), or navigating the menus.<br /><br />  It all worked perfectly! Played Dance Central 2 and Gunstringger so far standing about 3-4 feet from my tv with no issues. No lag and no problems sensing me or with face recognition. Alot of issues that I read in other reviews were not an issue for me. Have not tried with two players yet. I will say the only issue I saw (and the reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5) was when I powered on my Xbox360... the Kinect vision box that displays in the lower right stays completely black for about 10 seconds and then the proper image comes up. Not really an issue as it straightens itself out. Not bad at all for the price and it works great. I would recommend to anyone with limited play space.<br /><br />My setup: 32\\" LCD Emerson and Kinect sensor placed in front of my tv about 2 1/2 Ft from the ground. MAKE SURE TO PLACE SENSOR BELOW 4 FT FOR BEST RESULTS USING THE ZOOM!!! (Otherwise it cannot sense the floor).<br /><br />*Update* I tried playing Kinect Star Wars with my girlfriend and it seems that it has trouble seeing both of us at the same time. I  believe that this is due to the fish eye lens.<br /><br />  This lens essentially tricks the Kinect by making it think you are further away then you really are. Turns out that everything in the middle of the lens it reads fine but anything towards the outside it can't pick up with accuracy so this narrows your play space from side to side and would cause two players to huddle next to each other.<br /><br />  The zoom works greatwith one player but is impractical for two so I lowered my rating from four stars to three. Nice try for a solution but not so good on quality assurance.

B007AJFSJW|5.0|Krugman has written a sensible and very readable book about what our nation needs to do to get the country back on track financially.  I wish everyone would read it.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really like this book and I'm looking forward to reading the 3rd one but it is getting repetitive. There is way too much talk of \\"Her Fifty\\", and way way too much inner goddess doing this or that.  I do like the story though.  It makes me want to read the next book which is what any good book will do.
0596009208|3.0|The book is ok, but I wish there were more code to compare what they are telling you to the actual code itself.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Okay so I borrowed this book from a friend's mom who said it was great. I have to disagree. It was very repetitive and the writing was... mediocre to say the least. Yes, I read the whole thing. Yes, I enjoyed reading it. Yes, I look forward to reading the other two in the series. It does kind of remind me of an erotic twilight, the irritating main character, the \\"troubled\\" boyfriend, the boyfriend's perfect family, divorced parents, a quiet dad and an impulsive mother... Just so many similarities. That's probably why so many people don't like it. Seriously though, if you're bored and looking for something \\"different\\" to read then just read this, I mean it's not too many books where you read about someone orgasming because her clit got whipped. Jus' Sayin'.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is the best Princess movie since The Little Mermaid!!! Some people like my mommma decided to judge it with Tangled which was good but this movie has action and adventure and everything that a child, princess lover, and adult would love.... No spoilers but the middle is a little scary and the close to the ending is sad and grown ups should watch this before children or watch with child! To me I was 100% into it. This was the first Disney Princess that does NOT get married which is great because it shows we can be ouselfves and have a happily ever after with out a husband... I hope there well be a part two comming soon???? PLEASE!!! All in all this is the best and I am definatly going to buy it when it comes out. Ive gone to see it in 3D and it was AMAZING!
B002JM1VJG|4.0|I am a Madonna fan and like all the rest I love collecting cd's DVD's...I was so excited when I had placed the order. When I received the item I was actually disappointed regarding the omission of many of her good tracks like Bad Girl, Oh Father, Drowned World and a few others. Well the picture quality on the first 10 videos are really substandard. I was wondering did I really get a genuine copy. I dont know whether Warner Bros selected those videos or Madonna herself but truly Celebration doesnt depict her as a complete artist. A video collection of 3 decades should contain all her videos regardless of whether it hits the charts or not. This Used To Be My Playground is such a beautiful ballad, Bad Girl which is my all time fav from Erotica, American Life which created a lot of controversy. Madonna is not just a pop artist, she is a legend a controversy Queen, and we as fans would prefer to see her in that way. Apart from the omission it contains tracks in the chronological order and good for someone who hasnt listened to Madonna or just starting to explore her discography.<br /><br />My favs on the DVD - All True Blue and Erotica videos, Justify My Love, Secret, Take A Bow, The Power Of Goodbye, Hung Up, Jump and Give It 2 Me.<br /><br />I would say its better to buy The Immaculate Collection DVD and Videography 93:96. But for fans as a part of the collection, its a must!

0385474547|5.0|I've spent the last two days reading Chinua Achebe's book, \\"Things Fall Apart.\\" I had to read the book for a university course about five years ago and paid it little attention at the time. I am better off for rereading it and giving its due attention the second time around. The book is a masterpiece of clear writing style and didactic narrative.<br /><br />\\"Things Fall Apart,\\" is a page-turning story of Okonkwo, a Nigerian man, and his struggle to preserve tribal traditions and personal convictions in the face of the white man, Christianity, and his own rash actions. Here is a piece of literature that reads like Vera Britton's memoir, \\"Testament of Youth,\\" or Richard Wright's, \\"Black Boy.\\" Achebe's ability to capture human emotion from the reader may be unequaled, and the story is as valid today as it was over 50 years ago.<br /><br />There is a line in the book that encompasses Okonkwo's story, as well of each of our stories perfectly. Having been exiled for seven years to his motherland, Okonkwo finds himself in a sad state (they didn't have prozac) and feeling rather sorry for himself, when his friend launches into one of the great motivational soliloquies in modern literature:<br /><br />\\"For whom is it well, for whom is it well?<br />there is none for whom it is well.\\"<br /><br />Each of us have a story to tell, and each of us thinks his life to be fraught with difficulties and hard times, more so than the next man. Achebe begs us to see our neighbor as ourself - one for whom it is not well. And therein we will find strength, as we realize (I'm quoting \\"Shadowlands\\"), via reading, \\"that we are not alone.\\" I cannot recommend this book too highly; it is magisterial in its delivery. Read it, reread it.
1439156816|4.0|My first experience with Stephen King and I found his memoir about writing inspiring. It got me thinking and able to get back to my own memoir, The Philosopher's Daughter. I've quoted him in my article, THOUGHTS ON WRITING over and over again. A fine work with great insight and easy exciting reading. I highly recommend \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.\\" I finally understood what it means to show and tell the story, his discription is vivid. He tells about getting drunk, then he shows what it looked like, the color, the smell. That's showing. It was a lesson learned. Thank you Stephen King and Amazon for presenting and selling this work.
0345803485|1.0|i found the reviews much more entertaining (and better written) than the book itself.  thank you!<br /><br />and ta think, a 13-yr old (or writing equivalent) can pen a best-seller and get a multi-million dollar movie deal.  like geez, so NOT fair, but go figure..  ;(
B00008RH8S|1.0|This was another contender for the \\"Young Girl Trying Too Hard\\" Grammy. She had the voice, she had the looks, she had the desire, and lots of older people saw money to be made. But although it sold a lot of copies, it was hollow, like her at the time (she was 16/17). To illustrate, her main thankyous were to her angels \\"for your spiritual guidance\\" and the piano \\"for being such a magical instrument\\".<br /><br />Luckily her life has thrown a lot at her since then and she grown because of it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|great relaxer. have done the whole game twice. music is calming. dependable. does not crash on my fire. recommended highly if you enjoy puzzles.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I purchased the I7-3820 on (07-08-2012) to build a mid-level gaming and browsing machine. Im really not too worried about the locked multiplier, since I only mildly overclock...when I do o/c. The processor, as stated earlier, does not come with a fan. That in itself was not a 'game-changer' since I always use an aftermarket fan anyway. Intel should have reflected this in the price, with an applicable cost reduction. They clearly did not. I coupled this purchase with the Biostar T-Power X79 board and did the latest bios update (X79AE213.bst) from their website. I also purchased the fan retention clamp pn# RR-ACCY-2011-R1 for my existing Cooler-Master Hyper212+ to allow it's usage on the socket 2011 board. The thing is \\"screaming fast\\", cool and stable. In my installation there is simply no need to overclock anything at this point. Every simulation I run (RF2, NKPro, LFS, GTR2) has a noticeable uptick in frame rate. It's a great CPU at a much better price vs performance than any of the other socket 2011 models. A true win-win for users.
1466401885|5.0|Very quick, addictive, and intense read. I fell in love with the characters and really felt that the story itself was believeable. Maybe its because when I was in college so many of my friends also had disfunctional relationships. Sometimes other people can just bring out the crazy in one another, especially in those years. And I feel like this was the emphasis of the relationship between \\"Pidgeon\\" and Travis.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Thia was definitely the best of the trilogy. As a social worker I found the story to be very intriguing as to why Christian was into his kinky ways. Excellent read, definitely puts the entire 1st book into perspective and answers all the \\"why\\" questions!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book after some coworkers told me I should throw anything else I was reading in the trash. I read it, and while yes parts of the book did get my pulse racing, there were so many little thing that were just too far fetched for me to really believe it.<br /><br />As someone who has some experience with the BDSM lifestyle, I find it hard to believe that anyone would thro their rules about control out the window for someone who literally fell into their office. You don't become a 27 yr old CEO of an international company with control issues, and suddenly throw them out the window for a virgin.<br /><br />All in all, the book was an easy read, I finished it in a nite. Parts did turn me on, and made me wish I wasn't single. I did consider taking my copy out bar hoping with me, I figured that would cure my singleness. Unfortunately, I'm a bit too \\"Princess and the Pea\\" over the small out of place details I couldn't let slide.
B001NKI60W|5.0|This movie is just too much fun. The plot, though weak, is funny. The music, ABBA, is wonderful. All in all this movie is a good romp. I like to watch it when I've had a bad day at work. The movie just brightens my mood.
B00845PV16|1.0|This was one of the worst comic book movies i ever see. I don't know which was worse..the first one or this. Clearly studios have no problem burning through cash. Ghost Rider is a cool @ss character too and they make the movie so cartoonish. The acting was bad, the story was junk and the cgi was definitley not as good as The Avengers. I think its safe to say Nick Cage is passed his prime, though i see another national treasure movie in the future so he can pay off his debts. I am going to give Seeking Justice a try and see if it goes back to his old ways like Con Air or Face Off, but not keeping my hopes up.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|Ordered this DVD July 11th received the order July 14th! I am very pleased about how fast the shipment was! The only thing is that the case for the DVD is hard to close because it is slightly bent out of place (that could be due to the shipment). Other than that everything is in great shape! So excited I found such a great deal on this product :)
B000002LQD|4.0|I obtained this cd through BMG music club back in the nineties when it first came out. I remember selecting it as one of my free selections. first impression was that i didn't like it anywhere close to my previous lou reed music purchase, New York, which i was entranced with at the time. Fast forward to this morning in 2012, Magic and Loss still strikes a nerve for me, and actually, has dated better than 1989's New York album and i venture to say that i like it more than his current collaboration with Metallica, Lulu. A lot of great songs on here: Dorita, What's Good, Power and Glory(Check out the duet with legendary jazz vocalist, Little Jimmy Scott), Sword of Damocles, Cremation-Ashes to Ashes(aka The Coal Black Sea~this is my favorite song on the album~really makes you ponder mortality), Harry's Circumsicion(another great Reed tune~reminds me of an earlier Velvet Underground tune called 'The Gift),Gassed and Stoked, Magician,Dreaming. Love the guitar sound on this album (guitars and played by Lou and his longtime stalwart Mike Rathke). If you \\"get\\" Lou Reed's music, you will love this. If you're a newcomer, start with the Velvet Underground's albums and New York from 1989. This argubly is Lou's best 'concept' record. I definitely prefer it to The Raven, which is my least favorite of Lou's 'concept' records.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I received this purchase fairy quickly! Considering it was used it looked great. There was NO scratches on the cd! Also it was an amazing deal!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent app....available in the various versions of the Bible...i use ESV.  I particularly like the verbal readin...sometimes it means more to have someone read it out loud to further implant what is written. Good to use when spending quiet time.  Always a pleasure to purchase from Amazon.com  They're so helpful with my Kindle Fire, which I heartily recommend,  when there's a problem.
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game that makes you want to play it all the time!!!!! I love it! The best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! awesome!!!!!
B004ZN9OTG|4.0|I just finished reading Luke Hartwell's [[ASIN:1478142928 Atom Heart John Beloved]] and the title naturally reminded me of this old classic album.  When the characters in the book put the music on, I had to do the same, even though that meant reconnecting a turntable I haven't used in a while since I only have this on vinyl.  Ahhh..... just as wonderful as I remember!  I'm giving the album four stars instead of five because there are some songs I just don't like.  But the album is worth buying for the title track alone.  I actually first heard the song in college in a music appreciation class.  Everything we listened to all semester was \\"classical\\" (baroque, etc.) and then at the end of the semester the professor put this on.  Whoa!  I bought it immediately.  My goodness, listening to that song is still one of the most pleasant things one can do as one spins around in space.

0307474259|5.0|Everything I have ever known about eating healthy and how to lose weight by creating a calorie deficit and exercising at least 5x a week has been completely thrown out the window. This book should be read by everyone especially doctors and parents. A few years ago, I lost around 20 pounds, but only lost about 1-2% of body fat in the process, and thanks to this book, I finally have an answer as to why I didn't lost more body fat during the process. I will go on this Atkins-like diet that this book recommends to see if I can finally lose the last extra 5-10 pounds, hopefully in body fat. Forget overeating and not being active enough. If you want to find out WHY your body stores fat, this book is a must read. People should not settle for the \\"you got fat because you overate\\" explanation anymore. Well of course you overate, you've gained weight and gotten fat, but why? Why did your body store the calories you ate as fat and not fuel for your body to burn? This book will explain it all, and it will explain why carbohydrates particularly starchy and easy to digest carbohydrates (what the experts claim should be the foundation of a healthy diet) is at the center of what causes the body to store and accumulate excess fat. If you're going to take advice from experts on weight loss and how to lose body fat, make sure they have the research and evidence to back it up like Gary Taubes has provided in this book on why we get fat and particularly from carbohydrates.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Like this game. Perfect for passing the time ie; plane, car,  waiting rooms ect. Sometimes it will stop in the middle of a game.  other than that I like. it.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I'm 43 and my progress had largely stagnated in the past 5 years and I just chalked it up to age.

A fantastic book that I highly recommend.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|beware this game gets very addictive. I had to upgrade to the full version from the free version. the full version has a lot more levels.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of variety. fun games. only a few unlocked easily. encouraged to download or sign up for 3rd party stuff for points to unlock games.
B005OSUL9I|5.0|This is a remarkably fine performance of Donizetti's first major success - his 31st opera. By that stage he had really learnt his craft and knew precisely how to sustain musical interest and tension. In this opera he has also got the advantage of an inherently dramatic moment in history as envisioned by a good librettist.<br /><br />So how have the performers risen to this challenge? In my opinion the whole enterprise is very fine indeed.<br /><br />Anna Netrebko in the title role gives a performance of real dramatic bite ranging from the reflective and forgiving to the passionate and fiery. She is totally on top of the considerable musical demands of the part. Her voice has also acquired an interesting greater richness and depth of tone and this is one of her finest performances to date.<br /><br />Elina Garanca is well able to match Netrebko musically and delivers bel canto singing of great accuracy. This is well up to the exalted levels we have come to expect of this artist. The scena and duetto in Act 2 featuring these two fine singers is a high point of intensity creating real sparks of temperament. However the part of Seymour as one would expect does not carry the same dramatic or musical weight as the title role so the limelight rightly remains on Netrebko.<br /><br />Ildebrando as Henry VIII is in good fine voice too with plenty of regal sonority to his voice and convincing acting. His confidence in the kingly role reminds one of his authoritive Escamillo role in the Royal Opera's production of Carmen.<br /><br />The roles of Seaton, Percy and Rochefort are all capably sung and acted whilst not being a serious challenge to the three main stars of the opera. The chorus is effective in a rather static production - although, to be fair, this is also the way they were cast by Donizetti - rather like commentators on the unfolding events.

B005H7WDTC|4.0|I have supplied reviews of the three sets this complete box draws together. This review, therefore is by way of a summary of my previous responses so there will be inevitable repetition.<br /><br />This is, on the face of it, a very generous and tempting coupling of Beethoven's symphonies all on three discs. The recording company, C Major, is in my opinion one of the very best working today. As a result we get unfailingly excellent surround sound and high quality visuals with sympathetic and knowledgeable camera work. So what of the actual performances?<br /><br />Thielemann is very much his own man in this important respect. What we have here is 'big band' Beethoven with a large modern orchestra. There is no effort made to reproduce in any way the sound world that Beethoven inhabited. The textures presented here are fuller and more luscious in contrast to the sparer and rawer sounds that 'authentic' instruments deliver. Thielemann favours a well upholstered sound world and for this he is much appreciated by his Viennese audiences. It will also appeal to all listeners at home who find the 'authentic' approach rather too lean for their taste.<br /><br />Thielemann goes further than just the sound world though and adopts a 'Romantic Period' approach to expression that would fit easily with Berlioz (think of his Fantastic Symphony)and the later Romantics. This is achieved by extensive variations of speed and dynamics, none of which can be found in the score. Indeed by contrast, Beethoven's own instructions for speed, with very fast and steady metronome markings, have often raised doubts about the feasibility of performances at that rate. This has now been answered by the authentic movement who can give lithe performances possible at those speeds with their reduced orchestras and playing on more flexible older instruments. It must be said that Thielemann's approach works best of all in the final three symphonies rather than the earliest in the set especially. This is simply because Beethoven has now moved along the road away from the more emotionally restrained Classical Period Haydn model of symphony writing towards the, as yet, close but uncharted territory of the Romantics which were soon to follow.<br /><br />I myself, was initially taken aback by the degree of Thielmann's un-historic approach which I found to be somewhat questionable. In particular I struggled with his frequent choice of slow and very variable speeds. This applies especially to the first halves of the 7th and 8th symphonies which are particularly heavy-weight, but both of which finish more quickly. The first two symphonies inevitably stray the most from the Classical period of Haydn and a world which Beethoven also inhabited. The 9th symphony naturally responds best to this approach and works very well. Upon further listening my views remain much the same - but nevertheless I definitely enjoy this set of well performed, well recorded but somewhat anachronistic Beethoven conducting. There are extensive extras provided in which Thielemann discusses his view of Beethoven with Joachim Kaiser.<br /><br />On its own terms this set comes with a strong positive recommendation but also with the proviso that this is unlikely to be first choice for purists who feel strongly about period performance style. I am certainly able enjoy it on its own terms, especially the 9th symphony but this set is really Thielemann's Beethoven rather the Beethoven that we have now been taught to recognise by current researchers at the very least or by followers of period instruments!<br /><br />On that note, it is worth stressing that the period instrument movements has improved out of all recognition over the last 20 years or so. Gone are the acerbic strings and doubtful woodwind tuning as playing techniques have overcome the technical problems of the instruments. Gone also is the belief that all a conductor had to do was beat time. Now conductors are fully involved with interpretation aswith any other orchestra or later periods of music.<br /><br />I would suggest that this set is going to primarily appeal and be rewarding to those who resist any form of period-aware performance and are essentially followers of traditions going back to the days of Klemperer for example. It may well be a less than satisfactory set for those who are attracted to any stylistic modifications made since then. The recording quality is outstanding however and shows the VPO to very good effect.sic.

1401307450|3.0|Here's a word that maybe Anthony Kiedis could use for a rap/rhyme: \\"FILTER!\\" As in \\"Maybe I should use a filter when writing my autobiography instead of writing down every single boring detail...\\" (Just a thought.) I admit I like to read autobiographies of movie stars and rock stars- most seem to involve explicit drug use but few recount such a childhood defined by hoodlum and hooligan activity. Kiedis is the spoiled brat who should have gotten a beating from his parents or his teachers or the cops for doing the things he did. He should get down on his knees and thank his lucky stars that he never got arrested or killed or worse, killed somebody else while he was growing up and acting so horribly (even he recognizes his behavior to be sociopathic.) I could've also gone the rest of my life without hearing the lurid details of his sexual encounters while going through puberty. Recounting with great detail how many times he enjoyed a particular girlfriend on a particular occasion was quite unnecessary and did not enhance the book any. It is also shocking and disturbing how he dismisses his father's irresponsible behavior for encouraging an eleven year-old to take drugs and have intercourse with an adult- that is date rape afterall! No wonder Kiedis grew up having no regard for other people. All he seems to do is bask in the glory of his delinquent lawless years where he terrorized innocent people and harmed his own body having absolutely no regard for anyone. I can't imagine how long it must have taken him to complete the Making Amends To Those Wronged step of the 12 Steps. It's in poor taste how he provides all the lurid details of all his sexual escapades, his descent into drugs and his rebellious acts both personal and professional. He could have summed them up a little more concisely; his narrative tires quickly. Unfortunately, he did not even mention his role as a drugged out surfer in \\"Point Break\\"- one thing I wanted to hear about. He briefly mentions Johnny Depp and River Phoenix but I really wanted to hear more about his friendships with those young actors in the 90's Hollywood scene. Like I said in my title, most of this book is \\"TMI\\" (too much information) but a lot is not enough information. All that being said, I really did enjoy the rest of the book that didn't overwhelm me with vulgarity. Keidis can be truly funny and intelligent. I guess it does make for an interesting and somewhat enjoyable read at times though. Of all the rock star autobiographies I have read this remains one of my favorites!
034580404X|3.0|The trilogy is better suited for female readers. The approach and writing style is obviously that of a feminine author. I was titillated rather than enamored with the books' content.

This book is a rollicking good time. The writing is superb. The story keeps you guessing. I couldn't put it down. The only reason I give this 4 rather than 5 stars is that it really can't be categorized as serious fiction. Sometimes, that's not so bad. Read this book.

The creative process there was interesting.  Loved the prayer chapter!

B0031RS7X6|5.0|I have only recently started reading books from Sophie Kinsella and I have enjoyed each one more than the last.  I could not put this down wanting to see how it played out right to the end.  This is a light read and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so much so that I proceeded to download and read the rest of Kinsella's books and none have failed to disappoint.  If you are looking for a light fun read with a spunky heroine this book will have you hooked.

I really was hoping to love this Trilogy but I found it to be a waste of money & my time.

As I sat outside reading, I could not stop myself from jeering aloud at and cheering aloud for your characters. I left the domain of the silos thinking more deeply about the blessings in my life, the type of person I want to be, and the kind of world I want to live in. In other words, your work affected my humanity -- as the best works of literature do.

It was about life and how things are not the way you plan things out.  It's about finding true love and becoming an adult.  I thought i'd just read some before i went to bed and then found myself almost 75% through the book.  I already purchased the Point of Retreat and i can't wait for her to write more!!!

I read all 3 in quick succession - a few bits of kinky sex, but mostly a love story, a strong heroine, and a fun easy read.  Don't stop at the first book though.  The story is not finished, by a long shot. Really enjoyed the books.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|As you can see by the ratings here, this is a very divisive film, with very few opinions falling \\"in the middle.\\" I can fully understand and appreciate why so many found it difficult to sit through. On the one hand, it is a frustrating film in that there is no real narrative to cling to - and nothing resembling a traditional scene until nearly 50 minutes in!<br /><br />On the other hand, it is... beautiful... that word, beautiful, just seems inadequate.. but I really can't think of a more fitting word. If you are unable to view this in HD, you really might do better to put it off until you can.<br /><br />The narrative, sparse as it is, opens with news that the middle child of a family has died. After several scenes of grief, we get a nearly 20 minute rendering of the creation of the cosmose, set to a gorgeous choral piece. Following the cosmic creation, we next see the individual creation of a boy, and will follow him from birth through to his mid-teens. It is at this age that the movie settles into a narrative flow as we see this eldest son, Jack, and his growing resentment toward his father and his uneven parenting. We are basically hovering like an observing angel as we watch Jack's first steps into adulthood... his loss of innocence, his sexual awakening, and his first mature realization of who his dad really is... in a manner that fuses both disillusionment and atonement...<br /><br />The photography, natural lighting, location, everything coalesces into a seamless portrait of a decade gone by. Nothing about this movie feels like a modern day crew shooting a period piece ... every shot, every scene from the 50s feels absolutely authentic.<br /><br />The themes of grace and nature and how they converge in a child coming of age are expertly expressed through the imagery, the jarring edit, and the exquisite preamble sequence of the creation of the universe.<br /><br />The way imagery tells the story, rather than verbose writing, sets this apart from almost any other movie I've ever seen. You don't have to listen to the father explain that he's losing connection with his family, you SEE it happen. You don't have to hear the children explain that one-by-one they have distanced themselves from their father, you SEE it happen!<br /><br />The way the edit jumps from moment to moment ... unconnected in sequence, yet we can still make the coherent connections ourselves... makes this the SINGLE BEST PORTRAYAL OF MEMORY I've seen in film! This movie absolutely plays like your own memory of childhood does, and not a \\"here's what happened, then this happened, then that happened, and now you know the story of my youth.\\"<br /><br />Pitt and Chastain play their respective parts with perfect subtlty - a credit to the actors, but also to Malick, the writer and director. It would have been easy to create an image of an overly abusive father, but Pitt's character is much more complex. He's not a bad man by any stretch, but he is flawed. He tries his best to love his children and raise them properly - but he also takes out his own feelings of inadequacy on them - not physically, but emotionally. It's a role that would be easy to overdo by any other actor, but Pitt manages expertly.<br /><br />Chastain, meanwhile, represents the presence of grace - a safe haven for the children - and a better piece of casting I cannot imagine - her face is the face of MOTHER. Loving, accepting, unjudging, even in anger...<br /><br />If the film has a flaw, it is in its inability to postively connect the events of the 50s to those of the 70s and the present day - and maybe this would be rectified in a second viewing - but after I finished the film, I felt that there were two narratives here, with the sequence of the 50s being the chief story. The secondary one is the \\"frame\\" story, if you will, of R.L.'s death, which opens the film. As I watched the movie unfold, I figured we were going to see the moments leading up to his death. But it is later revealed he died as a 19 year old, an age which we never see him. This event, though it powers the first 30 minutes of the movie, ultimately has no bearing on anything that you see. It felt like a last minute inclusion - a way to open on an emotional note. But, the movie is really about Jack and his memory of his parents, and NOT about R.L.<br /><br />Now, as a Christian, I can see how the death in the beginning and the repeated refrain of \\"where were you\\" asked toward God leads seamlessly into the story of creation, as it does in the biblical book of Job, a quote of which we see in the opening of the film. But, the average viewer is not going to get this connection - and I felt the movie could have skipped the death/grief sequence and not been any the weaker. I think that time could have been better focused on creating a more coherent storyline for Sean Penn's portrayal of the adult Jack.<br /><br />But, as I said, perhaps a second viewing will change my mind. In any event, it isn't a big enough weakness to detract from what is otherwise a VERY powerful experience!<br /><br />Know going in that this is NOT a movie about narrative - there is no beginning, middle, end... no protagonist/antagonist... this is about feeling an emotion, experiencing a memory, and connecting to the larger force that is God and Creation. If that isn't something you are ready for, then do not bother watching this movie - you'll simply walk away thinking it the most pretentious piece of indie art-house indulgence.<br /><br />Also know going in that this is NOT a movie that can be watched if you are distracted by anything - this is a movie that you need to clear about 2 and a half hours and watch uninterrupted. Probably best to watch it alone, so there is no risk of your fellow viewers talking during the experience. And as I said, watch it on Blu-Ray... THIS IS A MUST!<br /><br />It's a shame Malick produces movies at such a slow rate, but if that's what it takes to work at this level, then so be it. This is the first of his I've seen, and I am eagerly looking forward to seeing his other works, few as they are.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I like most people, I usually know about big time movies coming out. For a movie to spend 250 million of production and another 100 million of marketing, i still had no idea what was john carter about. However, after watching this movie on dvd, it became evident to me Disney was just incompetent and destroyed what could of been the greatest trilogy of all time. Buy this movie, it one of the best made movies of all time. Great story line, action, costumes...the list goes on and on. Great detail went into this movie that was destroyed by failed marketing efforts.
0307352145|3.0|Susan Cain's book highlights the ways in which our current (American) society has been structured to favor and reward extroversion over introversion. Cain uses research results, personal stories and historical events to argue the need for a more balanced approach at school, work and home that celebrates characteristics that are typically displayed by introverts such as self-reflection, quiet thought and good listening skills.<br /><br />While the book is full of interesting arguments and creates awareness of the ways in which our society favors extroversion, Cain makes some errors which hurt the overall impact of her ideas. One of these errors is to create a divide between extroverted and introverted individuals instead of focusing more on valuing the characteristics themselves. This approach is likely to make those who consider themselves extroverts a bit defensive, and those that consider themselves introverts somewhat marginalized. Had Cain focused more on promoting a mindfulness about the benefits of introvert characteristics, the book would likely have more impact.<br /><br />This is not to say that there are no useful parts of the book. In fact the last few chapters are quite practical and suggest some ways in which teachers, parents and supervisors can better integrate and accommodate the needs of introverted students, children and employees. It also provides some interesting historical facts about 20th century American history and sociology that one is unlikely to find elsewhere.
0345410025|4.0|This is a good book not just for students but for everyone wishing to improve.<br />In the short time that I have had this book, I have been able to memorize a few hundred names, no problem.  What I will say that after you memorize whatever you have memorized, you need to apply it in any way you can. For instance,  In about 10 minutes, I memorized the definitions for 20 difficult voabulary words, and revised them over the next two days. A few days later I quizzed myself on them and surprisingly, I still remembered all of them!<br /><br />To anyone who wants to have a great memory, this is a great book!

Played the movie for the whole family when we got it and was again surprised how much I and everyone else enjoyed it. Kids had to turn away for one spot in the show, but the good guys win in the end so that's good too.<br />Just a neat show. (The only show I like Spader in.

I am all for a racey novel but not one that is stilted in its prose and lacking in believable characters. The author should not quit her day job.
B006PTL1GC|4.0|In the early 1900's Sigmund Freud developed a method of analyzing dreams that some in the psychiatric profession considered dangerous.  This early look at what became known as psychoanalysis is focused on a young disciple of Freud's, Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender, \\"Prometheus\\").<br /><br />An early patient of Jung was a disturbed young woman who had prolonged fits of hysteria.  Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) suffered abuse as a child and had grown to enjoy sexual pleasure from pain although she remained a virgin until Jung fell in love with her.  Jung was happily married with several children, but couldn't resist Spielrein once her health improved and she was no longer his patient.  In one great scene after their affair was over, a now married and pregnant Spielrein asks Jung if \\"he had taken on any other `admirers'.\\"  He replied \\"you were the jewel of great price.\\"  Great words from writer Christopher Hampton.<br /><br />Director David Cronenberg (\\"Eastern Promises\\") uses a vast library of coorespondence between the characters to develop the film.  The sets and locations in Austria and Germany are beautiful and appear authentic.  Again much information on this era was available to the filmmakers.  They got it right.  Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen, \\"A History of Violence\\") eventually mentors Spielrein who becomes an influential child psychologist of the day.  His relationship with Jung begins to sour, however, as Jung believes Freud is too narrow-minded in his analyses.  The film is provocative and sometimes erotic.  Mortensen and Fassbender deliver understated performances and Knightley gets your attention when she goes into full hysteria mode as Spielrein.  You may hate her or love her, but you'll surely remember her.  The movie certainly isn't for everyone, but I liked it.<br /><br />I could find no fault with this Blu ray 1080p transfer.  Using a 1.85:1 aspect ratio every detail is perfect.  Dark shots are dark and exterior well lit shots are beautiful.  This is really a great film to look at.  The audio is near perfect as well.

0345803485|5.0|I honestly wonder if people know what they're going to read before they read it. This is a romance novel an erotic romance novel. Think harlequins and those thick dirty paperbacks women read. This is typical style of a romance novel. It's it's a fun easy reading naughty book with a twist. You guys are way over thinking it.<br /><br />I think I read someone who said something about it being really unrealistic.....how no woman is going to orgasm like that and if he was really that successful he would never have time for her. Yes I want to read a romance novel where the main female character can't orgasm during sex, and the guy is ugly and poor and has no time for her. Yes that's the realistic heartwarming story I want to read. Not.<br /><br />It's fantasy, your little escape from reality. Enjoy it. That's what romance novels have always been for not for their difficult reading and realism it's not a college lit course. And for anyone who hasn't read it yet and is thinking about it ask a couple of your real life friends who've read it to get a better review. most people who aren't in computer land don't over analyze and will just give you a yea it was good or no it wasn't .
B004MC8CA2|5.0|a great find. zero complants. you can read it yourself and have it read to you . it holds your place for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three books, in three days!  Could not put them down....and do not listen to the reviews that says it's porn - it's a love story to it's core, and last time I checked, most porn is not concerned with love!  Yes, there are times when it can get a bit repetitive....but I was so engulfed in the emotions and story line, it really didn't bother me.  If you love reading romances and love stories and reading about sex (yes some of it's kinky, but who cares, it's not hurting anyone!) - then look no further than this book!  and trust me...buy all three, because once you get to the end of book 1, if you're like me you couldn't get your hands on book 2 fast enough.

I agreed with Ms. Minger only because I have changed my eating habits in the past year and my hypothyroidism and muscle/bone weakness/pain have dramatically improved within 6 months of giving up wheat. Another change was to drink homemade bone broth everyday and use butter & coconut oil to cook with. I also lost 20 lbs effortlessly. Many vegetarians eat a heavy diet of GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN, SOY & CANOLA and highly hybridized wheat. Our feedlot cattle and poultry are feed GM corn and soy. Something is terribly wrong with our nation's health. Cancer, autism & autoimmune diseases have risen rapidly in just the past 10 years for children and young people. I believe it's the GMOs and highly hybridized wheat that have NEVER been independently tested on HUMANS for safety and nutrition. Whether it's meat, vegetables, fruit or grains we need to focus on the QUALITY and SAFETY of our food. I say LABEL GMOs so that we know what's in our food and what we're feeding our kids. All of us should have a choice in whether we want to buy genetically engineered food.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and can't wait for the next one! Truly one of the best I've read, and that's saying a lot. I liked this even more than the fourth game of thrones book, which I just finished. You definitely will no be disppointed.
0545265355|5.0|Enough reviews out there for this trilogy but wanted to add more positive feedback to the arsenal.  Pulled me in and wouldn't let go. Many different emotions.  love to love some characters, love to hate others -.  Now just to wait for the next two movies.

I thought it might give me a better understanding of the culture. Nope.<br /><br />This book took me 2 months to read because every time I started again I got so fed up. And I have a habit of having to finish a book I start reading. What a waste of a summer read. I power read through the rest just to finish it. I admit the last few chapters get better but the beginning was muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurder.<br /><br />I will never read the trilogy. Yes the reviews are split. Yes some people love the book. But I was definitely not one of them. Hopefully I can find someone who wants to read it just so I can get it out of my house. What a waste of brain cells and money.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I was looking for a cable for the Kindle Fire so that I could charge it with a 110 volt outlet.This is the cable I was looking for.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|There's a lot to like about [[ASIN:B007VUCAVO Battery HD Pro]]. It's designed for Android 2.1 devices, but since I've only used it with the Kindle Fire HD and the 1st generation Kindle Fire, you may want to look at other reviews if you have a different Android device. This review has been updated from my original review of 7/14/2012 to add the Kindle Fire HD, as I've installed it on that model to calibrate the battery.<br /><br />This tight little app takes up only 5.1MB memory (now 6.7MB in version 1.36, updated) and will download on less than 60 seconds. What makes this app so good is that once it's installed and calibrated, you'll know instantly how much time you have for whatever it is that you'll be doing, in hours and minutes:<br /><br />◆ Battery health<br />◆ Music playback<br />◆ Video playback<br />◆ Reading books (of course!)<br />◆ Internet browsing<br />◆ Time left to recharge<br />◆ 2D and 3D games<br />◆ Temperature and voltage<br />◆ Battery Technology<br /><br />This is just a partial listing, and other Android devices (smartphones, etc) may find additional options. The large visual battery color can be customized, as can the notification settings and the charge level alerts. Calibration of of the Kindle device is highly recommended, as it will help \\"tune\\" the battery. The calibration menu reminds you to unplug the charger, lets you know if you have the necessary charge level for calibration, notes that a Wi-Fi connection is required (at least on the Kindle Fire with that connection), and to not use the device during calibration, which will take 60 to 90 minutes.<br /><br />There are two versions of this app available here: the one that I'm reviewing and the [[ASIN:B007VUA7VO Battery HD]] app, which is a freebie. I started with the free version, and then upgraded to the one here in my review. The only difference that I could find is that the [[ASIN:B007VUCAVO Battery HD Pro]] app has no advertising. The ads in the freebie are not irritating, and are very small, but when I find a very good and useful piece of software, it's worth purchasing, if only to encourage the developers. And if you start with the freebie, then later upgraded, your settings and calibrations can be imported easily.<br /><br />[Updated 1/23/2014]<br /><br />I bought the [[ASIN:B00BWYQ9YE Kindle Fire HDX 7\\"]] in 12/2013, and based on prior experience with other Kindle Fire tablets, this was the first app that I installed on that device. Speaking personally, I've found it to be an essential app, and one well worth considering for any user.<br /><br />Whichever one you choose, Battery HD or Battery HD Pro, you'll find an excellent 5-star utility app for the new Kindle Fire HDX series, the Kindle Fire HD or for the original Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Updated 12/7/2012, 1/23/2014rritating, and are very small, but when I find a very good and useful piece of software, it's worth purchasing, if only to encourage the developers.

034580404X|3.0|I don't see what the big deal was with this book? Yes it has a lot of sex, unrealistic to the point of skipping past the sex parts, but the plot was lacking. Show me a man who can have an orgasm 3-4 times a day and a virgin who turns into a nymphomaniac and I may have enjoyed this book more. I have never met a woman who was able to have an orgasm through intercourse when she lost her virginity. Yes I know it is fiction, but Stephen King is more realistic than some of this book! It was okay, but not worth talking about nonstop. I understand this was made for women, but are we all desperate housewives who have sex so rarely that we rely on unrealistic expectations? As far as the bondage and S&M, I heard the author researched this book by looking at websites. If this is true than perhaps more research should have been done so as not to offend those who practice this by choice and not because they had a traumatic childhood.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Recently, this show was brilliantly parodied on SNL because of the sex scenes. There may be a grain of truth to the accusations.  However, if the show wasn't so good, no one would bother.  Game of Thrones is the best series on TV, in spite of a few flaws.  HBO should hire the crew who put together that parody, because of their exceptional work, and keen perception of the material!<br /><br />Season 2 was fantastic, the highlight being Episode 9, written by George R.R. Martin himself.  It was like a top-notch feature film.<br /><br />The TV version of Game of Thrones is an interpretation of the original books.  David Benioff and D.B. White use their own expertise to bring the books to the screen.  It's not child's play. They are thoroughly familiar with the source material and bring it to life in an entertaining way.  Their work is groundbreaking.<br /><br />My only complaint was in Episode 10.  While I've been able accept CG direwolves and dragons, I was disappointed with the CG White Walker on a horse.  A cartoon isn't scary enough.  Hopefully, the production team can come up with a better idea...<br /><br />Meanwhile, fans are anticipating a great Season 3.  Wonderful show!
B0086DBE62|4.0|This is a fun movie for kids and adults alike.  Julia Roberts does a great job playing the villainous queen, and Snow White is a strong, capable roll model.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|I bought the CD around the time it came out when I was in Europe at the tail end of an exhausting month-long tour.<br />I never stopped listening to it on the plane - all the way back to San Francisco.<br />Since then, Coldplay have put out some really good records, but for me nothing compares to this debut. I'm not sure why, as their songwriting and musicianship is as strong as ever. Maybe it's the first taste of something that sticks with you.<br />Highly recommended.
0345803507|1.0|I wanted to read what the fuss was all about with these books but after reading the first one,  I will not be reading any of the others.  These books are nothing but hard core porn and at first I would have said that young women were the most at risk from these books but now I think older women are drawn to them as well.  Some may see these books as fantasy and think that they are not damaging but it is not presented as fantasy but reality.  In the end of this first book,  Christian whips Ana and she finally gets it and leaves him but she should have done that at the first spanking which is just as much of a violation.  Now I do believe that two consenting adults can do whatever they wish behind closed doors but this is just plain degrading to women as well as men.It is not responsible writing.  What do these books say about our society?  Sick..............
B0054JZC6E|5.0|kept me entertained for hours. there is so many games that I didn't know where to start. I just can't stop playing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the app is cool but it is slow at loading.<br />I play it almost everyday.<br />when is the next update.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great on the kindle fire it is also very addicting. Like I said before this app is AMAZING.You will be amazed about how great this app works on the kindle fire or on any kind of mobile device.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not sure I will read the sequels................just so/so for me.  All that's missing is the picture of Fabio.  What is the big deal?
030771652X|4.0|Don't start this debut novel if you expect to get anything else accomplished.  I couldn't put it down.  This could have been just another mystery/missing person story.  However, Lupton's clever use of the sister-to-sister letter catapults the book into engaging literature.  As the story unfolds and we come to know each sister's world, the reader becomes fully invested in the outcome---and what a heart-stopping ending it is.  Read slowly (it will be hard not to rip through the pages) and savor each description of the landscape, sisterly emotions, and a mother's strengths and failures.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down! The plot line was genius! I was, however kind of disappointed at the ending. It just left you hanging- but I'm sure the author wanted it that way so that you really had to think.
B003TJR2HS|4.0|My wife's iphone would not stay connected to the ipod connector on here usa-spec adapter in her sequoia because of the case on her phone. This puppy in between does the trick nicely.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|Before I purchased this flash I bought an \\"Off Brand\\" flash with Auto-Mode that said it would work on my camera. Even some of the reviews of that flash said it worked \\"Great\\". The fact is \\"other\\" flash unit Did Not work \\"Great\\". In fact it did not work in \\"Auto-Mode\\" on my camera at all. I have a Nikon D-5100 camera and at first did not want to invest in an expensive flash so I thought I would try the cheaper one first and I KNOW I should have known better. When the cheaper flash arrived I shot several pictures with it and the first thing I found was that my camera did not recognize that flash and the built-in flash on my camera kept trying to open with my camera set to the \\"Program\\" mode so I was ONLY able to test that flash using other setting on my camera. I was able to successfully get a few pictures to come out OK but was very disappointed in the \\"so-called\\" Auto Mode of the \\"other\\" flash. I returned that flash and bought this one. There is absolutely NO comparison. This Nikon flash works flawlessly, in ALL modes of my camera. The built-in flash does not try to open on my camera and every shot I took came out Great. Also there is a noticeable difference in the built-in flash and this one as well, especially on longer or wider shots. I am VERY happy with this flash. Obviously this Nikon flash was twice as expensive as the other flash but I believe you get what you pay for. This flash is well worth the extra money. Live and Learn yet again.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a little hard to understand some of the games but fun overall good time waster. my niece loves it
1595828753|5.0|As I reviewed it on The Promise 1 story continues but short.<br /><br />I bought for my son who loves Avatar and I'm like him love the story.<br /><br />Don't mind that they moved on with Korra but hopefully they continue with the Graphic Novels, definitely a must read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is one of best series I have read in quite a long time.  Yes, it was extremely explicit in its sexual content, but the story line was captivating and nail-biting.  I highly recommend this trilog, it is a heart wrenching story and very hard to put down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Romantic, naughty and adventurous. I think the haters are being silly;  if you are looking for high English literature try the Bronte's, Lessing or Thackery. Why be pretentious and write smug literary criticism about a romantic trilogy. Seriously, this little trilogy has all the makings for a great summer read. First love, overcoming fear, hot, rich and possessive Alpha. EL James has written a lovely, entertaining, romantic page turner.  The  errors are minor enough to be overlooked. I am also an English teacher, so if I can overlook this in favor of an engrossing love story  other readers can probably do so, too.  Ana and Christian have an awesome romance; they sizzle and make for an awesome summer read. Buy it, and enjoy!
1781161097|4.0|I used to work at a film and video production studio which primarily produced TV commercials and industrial videos - so we didn't get to do cool projects like Prometheus - but I'm still interested in how big budget movies like this are conceptualized and put into production. A book like this gives a great deal of insight, by presenting a lot of gorgeous preproduction artwork and commentaries, into how a film of this scope and magnitude was envisioned and then put on the big screen. The reason I didn't give this book a five star rating is because there were too few behind the scenes photos which I know exist because I have found them on the web. If you want additional details about the production of this movie take a look at it's posting on Wikipedia, and later this year there will probably be an in depth article about this great looking movie in Cinefex magazine.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is fun and easy enough for all ages to play. Will have fun sharing game with family in a few weeks.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Hopefully the publishing house will read some of these reviews.  Had the electronic version been at least even with the paperback version I would have purchased, instead I'll take my time and check them out of the library.  A fair amount of hubris on their part to price the electronic version higher in my opinion.
B0086700CM|5.0|I  love this app. I think everyone should buy this app. My only thing is the music. Not my favorite. But everything else<br />I love. :-)
B0086700CM|5.0|THEY MADE TEMPLE RUN FOR KINDLE!?!? YAY! OMG IM SO EXCITED TO PLAY!! once it downloaded from my cloud....... :(
B00760BPOC|4.0|Continuing the epic, but still lots of loose ends. Still introducing new characters after 5 books, which prompts the question- is the end in sight? Personally, I could see this going on for at least another 3 books to tidy up all the bits and pieces. Good book, IMHO not as good as 2 or 3, but still fairly satisfying. Bring on #6!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app! It is visually appealing and fun to play. I almost passed it up because the icon looks boring, but I guess you shouldn't judge an app by it's icon :).
B006N0YWGY|5.0|great game just one thing I wish I had more money............ darn taters get out of my way.  this is the reason why
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i really enjoyed the hunger games and i would have to say that the whole series is better than i expected.
055357342X|5.0|I struggled with what rating to give this one. I was unsure that it measured up to the way I felt about the other books I've given 5 stars, but it definitely provoked my emotions all around. Surprise, excitement, hope, fear, dread, frustration...I could keep going. And when a book brings out so much in me I have to give that book the honor of my 5 Star rating. And so I have.<br /><br />While reading A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, I found there to be several slow parts. I'd come upon a particular narrator and think \\"Ugh, not XXX's chapter! AGAIN!\\" And even when a narrator's chapter would come in A Storm of Swords that I wasn't particularly interested in reading (say...like Sam's), most of the time, something would happen that either surprised me or kept me interested. It usually only took a couple of pages to get me excited about the narration swap. The swapping back and forth has always been something that frustrated me because usually just as one narrator's chapter was getting good, we'd swap to one that was less interesting. Not the same in this book.<br /><br />A Storm of Swords is like the third book within the last three months where I've had the thought, \\"Absolutely nothing good is happening to these people.\\" Every single hope I have for these characters is shattered time and time again, but I don't dislike the book because of it. No. If anything, it makes me like it more. It's when things are unhappy that presses me to continue reading until I'm either finished or I come to a place where I feel satisfied. But that did not come. I also found I was quite unable to predict any of the surprises and twist. Though quite a few I probably should have seen coming. Oh well. If Ned Stark's beheadding in A Game of Thrones surprised anyone, just you wait for what's coming in A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />I've frustrated my husband a good bit throughout my reading of this book. Whenever something big would happen, I'd eek and squeal, but I'd refuse to tell him why so that I don't ruin anything for him. He got to the point where he said, \\"Either tell me what happened, or shut up!\\" Ha! Bless him!<br /><br />I debated on whether to jump right into A Feast for Crows or not, but I still haven't decided. On the one hand, I have quite a few questions after A Storm of Swords, whereas on the other hand, I cheated and looked at the narrators for A Feast of Crows and I'm not sure that it's going to hold the answers to most of my questions. But there's only one way to find out.<br /><br />A Storm of Swords 5 Stars, full of surprises and action, and provoked a wide range of emotions for me. Check it out, and let me know what you think!so that I don't ruin anything for him. He got to the point where he said, \\"Either tell me what happened, or shut up!\\" Ha!

B007U8U1V8|4.0|Jack White's BLUNDERBUSS is different. Just plain different. But it's also my album of the year so far. The lyrics aren't as we see in pop today (...I ate sixteen saltine crackers then I licked my fingers...) However, some of the lyrics make my top of all time. (...My temper got the best of me/and when i say that i mean/i know every single thing/that i said was true...)<br />So, go buy this album, and feel good, like you never have before.

B007FH9GA6|2.0|I heard so much about this story from people who read the book.  I started the book but never finished.  I didn't see the movie in theaters but I thought that I would catch it on Amazon so I bought it.  Instead I saw it on cable.  At first I thought it was interesting but as the story went on I found myself less and less interested in who did what to whom.  It became a standard thriller that tellegraphed it's ending a mile away.  I also didn't get into the characters at all.  Too bad.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|The movie is like a fairy tale, cinderella and mary poppins, sort of but more mary poppins. The sets are amazing, color and imagination, like Chocolat. You want to jump in and live there with all the magic or be the Nanny and use her magic for fun and helping people to make a shift inside themselves by the use of stardust and love. It is hard to see the love with Nanny but it is there, she covers it up because the shift has to happen with her too. The roses all over the cottage, the cakes and pies and tarts, the kitchen and all the tools that all come from out of the storybook, the fireplace, the velvety bright pink chair, the piggie, the donkey, the make-up and dressing them to be like people, Mrs. Teapot, Simon- he needed someone to help him make the shift. What else did I love, the magic walking stick, the wedding dress made out of snow, Nanny was an angel, Mrs. Pringle? was really not so bad, she wanted to be happy and believe. The dresses, the carriage and the muddy country lanes, the trundle beds all lined up in a row. The final letting go so the happiness comes. Especially Nanny, the fun way of learning, the measles, the medicine, making conscious choices and learning, finding your way.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|the levels do seem random in difficulty, but enjoyable all the same. hard enough with enough variety to keep me engaged, but not so hard that I am too frustrated.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game has been tons of fun. it took about 1 min or less to figure out how to get out of the game but it is easy and I love the parental controls. my son cant buy anything without me knowing.

0552778052|5.0|Dawkins truly has a gift for explaining the complex details of all sciences in a simple, clever, imaginative way.  Unlike many unbearable, boring books on scientific suggestions, The Magic of Reality paints a motion picture in your mind that takes the reader back through time and gives a great understanding of the world and how it came to be. The illustrations by Dave McKean allow the reader to feel as if they are a part of this marvelous journey through the ages.  Perfect for the teenage student exploring their beliefs and seek undeniable evidence from either side of the creation/beginning of earth theory. Dawkins effortlessly informs the reader on the one topic few Scientists dare to discuss in public, and does it in such a way, it cannot be considered wicked, but plain and clear. Great Book. I definitely suggest reading.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely a wonderful series!!!! Waiting for the follow-up, but then so isn't everyone..You have to get past the first book to enjoy the whole series..Loved my Fifty!!!  Missing them already  :(

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can't really write a review since I haven't read this book. I just want to say thanks to those that have and kept me from wasting my time and money. One of my biggest pet peeves is an author that writes an american character but uses words that nobody would use. That and repetiveness that can make a novel out of a short story. Eventually I will probably read this to see why it made the best seller list. Which will only happen if somebody has it that I can borrow. I do thank Kindle for allowing people to post their own reviews good, bad and ugly.

B004LWZW7E|3.0|A world of class struggle. Time zones differentiate the haves from the have-nots. People live normal lives until age 25, then they live by the hour. Rich people have many hours, poor people have few. In the slums, filling up your time account is a daily chore. You never get older than 25, physically, as long as you keep your time account affluent. When your time account runs out, you are dead. You time out. You can also always choose to die in a regular manner. Being immortal requires staying away from physical damage and keeping your time account covered. Timing out has become a new mode of suicide, a convenient one.<br />What a world of riches this idea of a sci-fi genius would have offered. Instead we are given a Bonnie and Clyde tale of substantial under-achievement. A slum boy kidnaps a rich girl and she does a Patty Hearst with him. So cute.<br />The subject should not be forgotten, it might still be turned into a good movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Simple and fun. On a tablet, everything fits fine. Game has many puzzles and grows in both complexity and size of puzzles, including plenty of intermediate levels.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is/was a great little game: just nice, basic solitaire...the card backs & background can be customized and it does this great little random congratulatory card dance when you win (I loved that!); it SHOULD have been good for relaxing with.  Except for the obnoxious, intrusive ads.  I put up with them for quite a while and I even emailed the developer asking why they don't come out with an ad-free paid for version.  These ads just kept escalating until I got stuck with a Match.com ad that I had to shut the game down to get off my screen.  It was just waaaay over the top.<br />I've become very anti-advertising...I'm tired of being beseiged by it in my mail, on my phones, on tv..EVERYWHERE!  So, I'm going to go ahead and delete this game.  I have found a replacement Solitaire game that has an ad-free option with the paid for version.  BUT it doesn't have the cool little card dance.  Oh well.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is such a good app one of the best and the brave one is to I encourage u to buy this app
B004GYY714|4.0|the app is so cool and has amazing sound. unfortunately it needs wi-fi. you would be crazy if you don't get this app. I use it every day. I can close the app and read a book or something while listing to great sounding music.
1475143389|4.0|Read this book from cover to cover and it contains great information. I already knew a lot of it but still learned some things too. I will be starting the program on Monday and will adjust my review as I see progress. I suspect that it won't be long before I up it to 5 stars.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|I love this game. Period. All the people who say you need to grind for hours, the upgrades don't really matter it is still hard if you still want them thoguh there is this thing called a fast forward button.

B0061Q13V2|5.0|I have loved gymnastics for as long as I can remember and love reading about gymnasts' journeys.  The book presents life as Dominique viewed it from her early days in gymnastics, to being national champion, to her olympic experience.  What will surprise readers are her candid thoughts about the Karolyis and her father.  Dominique's story has many ups and downs and surprise turns, but now as an adult, she has accepted her past and has moved forward with her own family and long-lost sister.
B00828JCI8|5.0|Great last episode of the season! I thought it was funny. I would not have purchased it cbs had it on their web site still, but they didn't and the internet didnt have it easliy accesable as well!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I was bitten by the SPIDER solitaire bite and now I can't stop playing it!  It's a good game with simple graphics.  It's perfect for travel.
B0006DKA2Y|1.0|If you search wikipidia you will see that Marlo Morgan has faked the story. She has admitted this publically. It is offensive to the aborinal people of Australia.
B0042JH0EE|5.0|I happened to catch this show on TV and my first reaction was, \\"Why is Mr. Magoo singing 'Ain't Too Proud to Beg'?\\"  When I realized it was Phil Collins, I began to wonder why he was singing soul songs.  But the more I listened, the more I was intrigued, and I appreciated that he didn't do anything \\"fancy\\" with the songs; he sang them as they were originally sung. I also realized that the backup singers and the band were great too.  The thing that really won me over was the fact that he wasn't singing just the usual, familiar Motown songs of the Temptations or Four Tops.  For example, I couldn't believe he sang two songs from Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions--my favorite soul group of all time!  That did it for me; I had to go out and buy the DVD.  I love it, and my only regret is that he won't be doing more performances because I'd love to go to one of these shows.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Shippment was really quick and the item was exactly as it was described. Awesome film and one of the bests i've ever seen.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I love this little guy! Dollar for dollar, an extremely well worth upgrade.<br /><br />Some background on my gear: Had the first Fiio amp, an E3, purchased in 2008 and powered by a single AAA battery. From small beginnings, big things come.... Anyway, I upgraded later to the E5 a year later, and ended up buying three of them. One went thru the wash inside a pants pocket, then the dryer. Works fine. True story.<br /><br />But I also own an Ibasso Cobra D10 portable headphone amp & DAC, a Little Dot Mark IV SE headphone amp with upgraded tubes, Shure SE530's & Ultimate Ears Triple Fi 10's with Comply tips, upgraded cables from exotic companies, a PS Audio Digital Link III DAC, Denon D2000 headphones, Grado SR-80i headphones, and a pair of handmade Beyer-Dynamic DT990's, the 600 ohm version. And I'm here to tell you: The $23 Fiio E6 amp sounds darn good. For $23, it sounds DARN good.<br /><br />In terms of synergy, it works extremely well with the Denon D2000's, which have a somewhat recessed midrange anyhow, attach the E6 and select the 'enhanced midrange' or 'blue' setting, and WOW the Denon's really shine here. The midranges come alive without the expense of a mid-bass hump, in fact, the deep bass gets a bit of boost without losing any texture or gaining bloat. Actually, all that happens when 'bass boost' or 'red' setting is selected (gives you a huge mid-bass hump with lost texture and gaining bloat, loss of definition, very muddy) with the D2000's, and I'd delete it if I could. I agree with ReeVueBoi, the 'blue' setting is my favorite, with my gear, anyhow. Second favorite is the flat setting, I use that with the Grado's and Triple Fi's. I'm a big believer in synergy. The advantages with the Grado SR-80i are not as awesome, but still worthwhile. I've not tried them with the DT990's, Shures, or the TripleFi's yet for any extended periods of time.<br /><br />I've not noticed a break in period. The effect of this amp was obvious after it's first full charge. About that... I have deducted one star for battery longevity. When you hold this thing, you notice how darn light it is. It does not feel as sturdy as the E5 at all. I don't believe the E6 would survive a wash and dry either. But battery life is a bit disappointing, and the sound quality, particularly bass slam, starts to diminish after about two hours of use. Then bass sounds downright distorted. Then eventually dies and shuts off. An amp so light must have a tiny battery, it must. And my use and experience appears to bear this observation out. On the plus side, the volume button is now 700% easier to use than on the E5, thank you for that.<br /><br />In a hotel room recently, the E6 went dead and I swapped it out for a fully charged E5 that I brought along as backup. It was like night and day, the improvement of the E6 was so vast and impressive, I just clicked around a few songs, and then just unplugged the E5 and just plugged straight into the headphone port (!!). In comparison, the E5 sounds clogged, strained, poor instrument separation, far poorer headroom, and a lot noisier. A LOT noisier. But it IS louder. The E6 improves, dramatically, all these areas. It's quite a stunning achievement for $23, it really is.<br /><br />OH - important! I\\"m using a dedicated LINE OUT DOCK on my iPod - this attaches to THE BOTTOM of the iPod, the charging port, not the headphone port. I have a couple different ones, including one that uses a silver alloy compound in the wiring, and this, far cheaper one, which sounds fine:  [[ASIN:B003UCESP8 FiiO L3 Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone]].  I've no idea what this amp would sound like plugged into the headphone port of an iPhone/iPod. Yeecch! That's for 7th graders.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Super value, could be used in case studies of the concept.<br />Sounds really, really good on most settings.<br />Easy to use, can operate blind or total darkness (can feel your way around the controls).<br />Small, light.<br />Multiple settings, for multiple headphone/earphones.<br />Looks cool. People go 'hey what's that?'<br /><br />Cons:<br />Battery life not more than a couple of hours before you notice decrease in sound quality.<br />Feels cheaper and not as sturdy as the E5. Very much so.<br />Looks cool. People go 'hey what's that?' right at the good part.<br />Bass boost not so good on my gear.<br />Adds a fair amount of complexity to your iPod/headphone rig, especially with a Line Out Dock attached, but this will be true of all amplifiers.<br /><br />Next, I'm going to buy an E11. for $59, it's a safe bet.

B0002STNQ2|5.0|PREY is a great book ~ action packed and my son loved reading it.  It was a selected summer reading for his school.  I stand corrected when I previously gave the book 1 star ~ the book itself is a 5 STAR BOOK.<br /><br />The 1 star rating which I still stand by is for Amazon ~ \\"The slight mark or stamp that may be present on the edges of a bargain book's pages is an industry's identification that it is an overstocked book and is not to be sold at the full price. Bargain books are not used, previously-read, defective, or inferior in any way.\\"~ quote from Amazon.<br />I bought this book for my son & it had the mark on the edge which didn't bother me.  HOWEVER, there was a credit card receipt from someone else's purchase in it so it was NOT NEW & obviously PREVIOUSLY READ.<br />Very disappointed.

1592332803|5.0|I've been on a mission to find the best vegan chocolate chip cookies recipe and finally found it here!  That, to me, is worth the price of this cookbook.  By the way, said cookies are even more incredible if you chill the dough overnight.  I have all of Colleen Patrick-Goudreau's books and use them frequently.  I also love her Vegetarian Food for Thought podcast.  Thanks, Colleen!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not the greatest out there but a decent way to kill some time.  the ads are a bit annoying at first but they are not so bad for a free game.  worth the download.
B005H2IAM6|5.0|For those of you that have never seen \\"Star Blazers,\\" but have instead watched other star movies and series, you owe it to yourself to see this. Star Blazers was the GREATEST cartoon ever and the movie does not disappoint. In fact, this movie leaves the cartoon behind in the wake of it's space warps. If you want to be able to say that you saw the greatest space movie ever, then you MUST see Star Blazers. Now, it is not dubbed and has US subtitles, so if you're going to complain about that, watch the movie with and then without the subtitles. TRUST me, you're gonna wanna watch it at least 3 or 4 times in the first week you own it. The sensory stimulation is just that good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is one of my favorites. I love all the game choices and I really love when the games go half off!
B00101ZOTA|5.0|I thought I could guess the ending but didn't do so well.  Great job in making a surprise mystery thriller.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|a very great game its a bit like spider-man 2 to give you idea but on the kindle fire!! abit lagy but it is understandable for the great graphics...I'm really tiered of people complaining about the app requiring a little bit of memory but when they open the app its a whole lot. 1, it said In the discription how much memory it needs!!!. 2, the memory requirement you see is just to open the game, you still need more to play it. and 3, do you really think a 3D game like this will not need a lot of memory
B007I1Q4W2|1.0|Why is \\"low budget\\" an acceptable excuse for a bad movie? \\"Enter Nowhere\\" was low budget yet a creatively written and well acted movie.<br /><br />Plot:<br />All the people on Earth start becoming zombies because a woman, whose sister was hanged for supposedly being a bad person, gets revenge on everyone by saying a few lines from some thousands' year old piece of paper she just happened to find in the southern US state. Story moves at the same pace as the zombies - really slow. Not sure if the story even had a direction or theme. Why do all zombies in movies seem to deteriorate to the same exact physical condition and get no worse? Why do they all walk in the same stilted way? Dumb!<br /><br />\\"Exit Humanity\\" is suspiciously similar to \\"The Dead\\" which also starts out with one guy then two and an unlimited amount of ammo for killing an unlimited number of zombies. They all seem to walk out of the woods in areas in which human habitation is near zero meanwhile not a single animal is to be seen. Camera crew must have scared them all away. Even the insects were scared away.<br /><br />No subtitles for the hearing impaired as well as inconsistent enunciation and audio control. A lot of cheap flip book style line animations interspersed throughout as a substitute for actual movie making. Excessive Hollywood fake hillbilly talk - quickly got tiresome because it was both bad hick speak and stereotyped.<br />Usual white facial paint; red dyed corn syrup for blood and maybe a facial prosthetic here and there.
B005PZ857K|5.0|I stopped cable and just buy the things I want to watch - cheaper in the long run. I have always been interested in shows like this, the cast is super and each show something different.
1599219751|3.0|We read The Long Walk in our book club and I purchased the Kindle book.  No problems with the book--excellent format and easy to navigate.  My problem was reading a review that totally dissed the book and said it was all a hoax and all made up.  I don't know what to believe.  The book is good, if a little short on words, descriptions, characterization.  I was very simplified it seemed to me, but the content/story was interesting.  The movie gave a better feel for the conditions in Siberia than the book.  For some reason the book gave me a picture of an almost pleasant place to be other than the cold.  It was not the reality of Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand.  I expected more of that and didn't want to read another inhumanity book.  This book is mild in comparison.  The trek seemed a little lacking in details which makes me feel that it may not have really happened.  Not enough stuff in it.  Just my opinion.
B005ZUR724|4.0|This is the perfect game. From the missions to the leveling up... You're even able to chat with other people! Top notch, five star game. My only complaint: having to pay for runes and gold. I mean I already paid for the game. Now I have to pay for gold and runes that I will eventually have to buy more of? Naw.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is great for the kindle fire! Good Grafics, and it  doesn't freeze up at all! I strongly recimend  this app for all ages

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved this series. I couldn't get it on television, but my sister told me to try Amazon. It was wonderful to be able to watch the series on my flight to and from the Caribbean. Great acting!
034580404X|5.0|I had been hearing about Fifty Shades of Grey but when I seen it was a trilogy I figured I'd get all three at this price. Well it was one of the best $25 investments I made in a long time. I read all 3 books in about 1 1/2 wks. You just can't put them down once you start them. I tell everyone that's looking for books to read to get this trilogy. If you're an avid reader you will see the story well beyond the initimacy that those have read it sees because its much deeper. Get them, you'll love them!

The first thing that registers is his height, but it's quickly followed by recognition of his energy.

He's been subdued the last few times I've seen him, but he's fully revived now.\\"<br /><br />Cricket is never described as a \\"sexy Greek god\\".He's awkward, too tall, filled with self-doubt and all these things make him more real and more amazing.<br />And then he is a \\"nice guy\\" and they are really underrated.

B003Y5H5B0|4.0|As a fan of the original I was pretty skeptical about this flick. Aside from my reservations about a remake (although, you could argue against this being technically a remake and more of a reboot), I was concerned that this movie seemed to focus on two characters instead of the ensemble that I remember from the TV show. I was also maybe a little concerned that this was more of a comedy, which is not really how the original was done.<br /><br />The movie gets through its exposition pretty quickly and, at the same time, makes a couple of comedic nods to its own unoriginality and the general unbelievability of the premise. After that, all of this sinks into the background and you're allowed to have a pretty enjoyable movie experience. This isn't the Jump Street of 25 years ago, but that would look pretty stupid today. The original premise was a fun one and if you just translate that into the present day, this is kind of what you get. It was a really fun movie.
034580404X|5.0|I was wondering what all the hoopla was  when I first started to read this series of books. I  was starting to get disappointed til around page 165  then WOW!!!!! I could not put it down!!!! Waitng to see if there are any sequels to this book???? Thank you and i got the 3 book set for a fantastic price!!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Okay, I am one of those that swore I would not buy any more of this series due to the time delay between books.  At my age, there is a good chance I won't live to see the end.  Heck, GRRM may not make it either.<br /><br />But, I found this book far ahead of the Feast of Crows and am now mad that I cannot find out what happens next in a reasonable amount of time.  At times, I thought, \\"Come on, let's get on with it!\\" and then I would realize that what was not currently interesting, could well be a key point down the road.<br /><br />One of the things I have always liked about this series is that seldom is a character truly good, or truly bad-with a few exceptions, of course.  It's no simple good versus evil allegory, and it is certainly not predictable altho' it may seem that way at times.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Stop giving this damningly good book 1 star just because it has adult themes. If you don't like your kids reading this then take your complaining to the school, but don't tarnish this wonderful book with low ratings. Idiots. GRRRRRRRRRR. Yea maybe its too mature but how does that mean its bad? There is no connection there.

1613822650|4.0|I was lucky enough to read an early printing of this so had a version with all the cool, edwardian illustrations. Without them, I'm not sure I'd read it. This is a light novel, fairly harmless in a boys own adventure kind of style (IMO.)<br />Great, nice read.<br /><br />Don't expect great literature, but if you like Sherlock Holmes and other fun adventure stories this could be a good one to add to your collection. I found the female stereotypes to be a bit too vapid, helpless and generally irritating to really love the book - but it is victorian.<br /><br />Fun. If you're into jewels, swashbuckling, treasure hunts and beautiful heroines swooning. I enjoyed it.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book.  It's not normally a book I would read.  College life, illegal fights, poker, gambling, drinking, teenage angst...not my cuppa tea.  But I couldn't put this one down.<br /><br />This author knows how to bring a world to life, create characters you can feel for, keep the plot and storyline moving quickly, deliver dialogue worth reading...in short, this author knows how to create a real book.  There's nothing formula or expected about this story. It's a romance but not a romance like any I've read before.  It feels real...the characters, the story, the romance...it all feels like something that could have happened.<br /><br />I read because I like escaping into worlds unknown with characters who intrigue me.  This book delivers.  Buy it and read it, and lose yourself in this rich story.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is wonderful! I especially love that its able to combine a peaceful and beautiful atmosphere with actual challenge. For those puzzle-lovers out there that are prone to frustration, the soothing music and gorgeous artwork will keep it at bay and keep you entertained for hours.
0679759328|4.0|The writing is lyrical, poetic and breathtaking.<br /><br />The story, however, is a slow one - so patience is required. But the novel is only 184 pages.<br /><br />The protagonist, Edith Hope, is staying at a lovely hotel in Switzerland for several weeks in order to \\"restore her to her senses.\\" She was convinced to stay at this hotel, out of site, if you will, because of the scandal she caused in her community by leaving her fiancé at the alter on their wedding day.<br /><br />Okay so what does Edith DO in order to help restore herself \\"to her senses?\\" Not much. So much of the character development in this novel is internal. It's showcased by the way Edith thinks about herself and how she sees others.<br /><br />A plus ... the novel definitely deals with the human condition, and some powerful themes like loneliness, love, confidence, etc.<br /><br />Will I re-read this novel, probably not (simply too slow for my taste). Will I re-read other Anita Brookner novels? Probably so; and that's because the line-for-line prose is just that magnificent.
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|Wasn't sure if I was going to grab a copy of CRB \\"BMR\\" Just did and felt compelled to write a review after listening to some tracks. I will go out-on-a-limb and say this is the best damn R n R I've heard in probably 30 frickin years. The one and only time I posted a review to Amazon was for Petty's Mudcrutch and I don't even know if my review got posted.    Some are sure to say CRB is \\"hippy-trippy\\" or whatever monicker they want to give it. Aside from the labels, it's the most inventive, soulful R n R I've heard in a long time. I've listened to a lot of stuff for a long time and probably more than Mr. Chris R himself. Hats off to Mr. Robinson and I wear them. Keep doing whatever your doing, drinking whatever your drinking and feed us your version of Southern Comfort indefinitely.    Rob's last Crowe's effort was grand also. Whether they are together or separate, Rob's are definitely moving in the right direction musically. I got Rich's solo on and it's very good, but Chris has got some major visionary thing going on that's extremely musical and spiritual. So yes, go out and get a copy of CRB and forget about yesterday's, today's and tomorrows F@#$%up news and rejoice that something out there hasn't been tainted.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl starts out slowly, and the excitement grows gradually chapter by chapter.  By the time I reached the half way point, I didn't want to put it down.  There are twists and turns and some real surprises.  I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a well-written page turner.  If you're one of those crazy people who read the ending first, you'll really spoil the story for yourself.  It is not what you might expect.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Awesome movie! The price was more than half at the stores and got here in the time it said it would. Very glad I got this movie, its one of my favorites.
0440180295|5.0|A lot of people say that this book is a very simple and easy read. And that's true, to an extent. But don't let that fool you, as it is one of the most layered, intertwined complicated books I've ever read. I've never read a book that flows so easily, and manages to parallel its own self as the plot is revealed piece-by-piece. I have to give a little *spoiler* to make my next point. At one point in the novel, the main character learns about literature that is written by this alien species that abducts him, the Tralfamadorians. Their books, they explain, are not written like Earth books. Instead of moving from beginning to middle to end, with causality peppered throughout, their books are instead printed on a single page. The reader reads all these different events, emotions, and ideas simultaneously, in order to get the full experience.<br /><br />I would argue that Vonnegut's book is an attempt to be \\"Tralfamadorian' in its style. If you are patient, and are open-minded to reading such a non-linear storyline, the reward in the end, I think, is something similar to what the Tralfamadorians would experience when they read their literature. It's an absolutely amazing book that'll make you cry in one sentence, lose all hope in humanity in the next two, and laugh in the sentence after.
B008D19WBQ|2.0|I just wrote to Warner Bros., saying that if they're going to release a Friends Blu-ray Disc boxset, they are going to have to put the extended versions that were first made for DVD release onto the Blu-ray Discs in 1080p24p/60i and Dolby Digital Plus 48KHz/24-bit 7.1 form, and they're going to have to add additional footage that originated from the broadcast prints to these new Blu-ray prints that may have been removed for some unclear reasons.<br />Yeah, this word should be spread to them.
0345536886|5.0|I received this book as a Christmas present last year and did not get a chance to read it until this summer. I've always been a John Grisham fan ever since I raked through my dad's collection. He has done it again, and I love this book so much I recommended it to my friends who love to read a good novel. I found myself laughing at so many points in the book; at the same time Grisham posted so many ethical issues through his characters. I felt like I was right in the book itself, observing the characters and their activities first-hand. Great job on the book, John!

030758836X|1.0|I read this book based on the really good reviews other readers gave it.  However, I must have missed the entire theme of the book because I found it downright disturbing and uncomfortable to read.  I like a good mystery, but this was far beyond that in my opinion.  I didn't enjoy reading about how this \\"should never have gotten married\\" couple grew to so hate each other and the premeditated scheming on how they were going to kill each other, just was too much. Amy, the wife in this book belongs in a mental & psych ward.  When I finally finished this book, I felt absolutely wrung out.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I've read other reviews and can only speak for myself.  I purchased this amp thinking it was going to be hit or miss.  I currently own the Fiio e6 and love it.  I use the Shure se530 earbuds and a Sony S544 mp3 player.  Without the e6 I can notice the difference in sound.  For such a cheap headphone amp the e6 is definitely worth the cost.  The Fiio e11 takes it up a notch.  I wasn't expecting much difference, but there is enough difference for me to say it was worth it.  My setup will be different than yours considering the headphones and mp3 player/computer you intend the amp for, but if there's anything I notice is how the e11 cleaned up the music.  The bass is smoother and better detailed, the highs are crisper and cleaner and the mids seem a little better.  I only intended to listen to a few songs to hear the difference when I first received the amp, but instead because I was so happy with the results that I wound up listening for an hour.  So if you're stuck with deciding whether or not to purchase the Fiio e11 let me encourage you by saying my results made me glad I made the investment.

0451196716|3.0|I just finally finished reading, or rather, taking 'The Long Walk' last night. And it was exhausting.<br /><br />The idea of a 100 young men walking on a suicide mission sounded so different from King's other horror-type novels that I had to check it out.<br /><br />Though, for me, it did try my patience. Especially towards the last 100 pages or so. I even found myself going back often, rereading certain chapters, trying to remember who was who, who got what warnings, and who was ticketed.<br /><br />Though I found the story in whole riveting, and at times downright horrific, I was somewhat put off when King would jump narrative and start swimming in and out of poetic passages. It just alienated me from the core action.<br /><br />But yet I get it. I totally understand why so many people enjoy this book. Some of King's detours are so beautiful and out of the blue that they truly are haunting.<br /><br />Here are a few moments, or characters, that I found myself obsessing over during 'the Walk'. Spoiler Alerts!<br /><br />Early on, Garraty watches Stebbins, the boy in purple pants and green jacket, eating a jelly sandwich in a tree and starts to wonder about him throughout the entire race. It gets to the point where Garraty is so fixated on this mysterious kid that it starts to border homoeroticism. The more Garraty pondered about the jelly eating boy, the more I pondered too.<br /><br />Their strange connection forms into a love/hate relationship that is tested to the very last minute of the race. And, it turns out, that Stebbins has a few secrets of his own, that really caught me off guard. There's also a moment during a rain storm where Stebbins is clutching his stomach as Garraty watches, thinking that he may be in trouble. But it turns out that he is only trying to protect his last jelly sandwich from getting wet. These little moments were so fascinating to me that I felt like I was actually taking the walk with them.<br /><br />Another standout moment for me was when the little hick boy wearing overalls, a curious spectator, simply starts walking along with the guys in the game. Then, after about a mile, gets tired and plops down on the side of the road and watches them go by. How ironic and bittersweet. For all we know, this same curious little boy could be walking the race, for real, in the next five years and taking a bullet in the head. This passage was so powerful to me that I dog-eared the page just so that I could go back and read it over and over again. No kidding.<br /><br />And, towards the end, when Garraty starts to loose it while watching the last of his friends wither down, like death walking in a parade, was pretty hard to take. Creepy stuff to swallow.<br /><br />What made all of this frustrating for me is that I wanted the boys desperately to revolt against the soldiers. For Garraty to confront the Major. But I knew it wasn't that kind of tale. But I guess, that just shows how invested I was in the story. But, nevertheless, it was still frustrating at times. And it just seemed like it was stuffed with too much padding.<br /><br />By the way, I have my own take on the ending, but I would like to hear other people's opinions.<br /><br />Did Garraty just go bonkers at the end? Running away when the Major came to honor him? I'm sure anyone in that situation would. And, him seeing all the dead walkers coming up the road behind him was also an interesting bit. Knowing King's fascination with the supernatural, could this have been intended for the open-minded? Maybe I'm reading too much into it for being so close to the fire right now. But, it still would be intersting to hear from others.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am not a reviewer. But I read a great deal of fiction and non fiction.  I like to get carried away with a well written story.  This is not one of those books.  The writing is sophomoric and the sex is, well, unimaginative. Far from an erotic read, this book was repetitive, boring and uninspired.  I did not read the sequel, which I hear was about the same.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|This book really makes you think about what you would do in their place. I have not finished this book but it is a great book to read but unless you have a mind that can understand Shakespeare at least a little bit you might need to take it slow and reread a LOT. trust me i have to do it ALL THE TIME! it makes the reading slower but overall this is a magical book that will show you the truth of friendship.

B008IBPECW|5.0|Downton Abbey is masterfully produced, directed, filmed and above all, acted. Start with Season One, Episode One. Seriously, you'll be hooked. It's fabulous entertainment, and the storyline is compelling.<br /><br />Starting with the year of the Titanic disaster, and ending with the start of World War One, Season One is where you meet all the characters and discover their distinct personalities (with a few surprises along the way). Mostly, Season One revolves around the discussion of, \\"Who will inherit Downton?\\" I found myself rooting for one person after another as the season progressed.<br /><br />In Season Two, however, it gets quite a bit more serious and dangerous, what with the war and all. Some don't come back. Some come back quite changed. And even those who stay home are quite changed by the end of the war. In Season Two, the plot thickens quite a bit both upstairs AND downstairs.<br /><br />I really don't want to say much about the plot for fear of spoilers. My only injunction is: watch Season One first, if you can. It is highly enjoyable. And as soon as you do, watch Season Two. It's a roller-coaster ride of emotions and worth all of it. And be sure to watch the final episode. Wow! What an ending! I hope there's a Season Three!
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I won't even go too in-depth with this review. The title is the whole point. In the days where electro-dance-house-pop is storming the airways and the iPods, Frank Ocean comes out swinging with a debut album with an odd freshness to classic R&B styles. He is refreshing, game-changing, and purely and simply certainly one of the greats. Mr. Ocean has LOTS of success in his future. He is candid, charming, sensual, silly, and heartfelt in his lyrics and delivery -- not to mention those super-polished imperfect pipes.<br /><br />This album will be a classic, if it can't be considered one already. Do yourself a favor, and let Frank Ocean take you back.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|I was hoping for more from this DVD.  If you loved Phantom of the Opera and were expecting something similar you will be disappointed.  I'm waiting to watch it again, when I can be more objective now that I know it's no Phantom!  There were some nice songs, but the story line was lacking something.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game and very time consuming. had to take it off once and had to start over but it kept me busy. my three year can even play this.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Enjoyed this version of Phantom.  Have seen Phantom twice - two different theaters.  Wish I could have seen this DVD version live!
B001Q94TQA|5.0|While visiting my family in Idaho, my daughter-in-law suggested this movie.  She convinced me to stay and watch with the girls because it was very good.  I enjoyed it very much, and after getting home, ordered my own copy from Amazon.  She is planning a movie night with her girlfriends at first opportunity.  I am sure it will go over well.  You can set the dialog to English instead of reading sub-titles.
1401233791|5.0|This book isn't one I have read before and after receiving it today I'm nearly half way through it. Here you learn that bane isn't the big dumb brute that most portray him to be, he is the complete opposite. Bane is a thinker, a planner, he is patient and will strike when he knows the time is right. Reading this so far may have put him as one of my all time favorite villains. The more I read, the more excited I am about seeing \\"THE DARK KNIGHT RISES\\" in theaters next week. I'm eager to see just how Christopher Nolan will portray the character of BANE. On another note, the packaging of my item was great! I received my book in perfect condition!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's a good game to play and pass time with. none of the games takes long to play. good old school games.

B005J4TLN4|4.0|A ragtag gang of young street punks living in South London council flats must fight a horde of hostile space aliens with big shining teeth. That's all you have to enjoy \\"Attack the Black,\\" a UK sci-fi horror comedy written and directed by Joe Cornish (his feature debut).<br /><br />The fast-paced film opens with a gang of teenagers led by Moses (John Boyega). They are not very nice people as the first thing they do in the story is mugging a nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker). But when an alien invasion starts with a strange object falling from the sky, the unlikely heroes, armed with a ninja sword and firecrackers, have to fight the creatures and protect the Block.<br /><br />The director's long-time friend and collaborator Nick Frost (\\"Hot Fuzz\\" \\"Paul\\") appears as Ron, a drug dealer, but the film belongs to the young players who did very good jobs. The film' story unfolds like that of a John Carpenter film at its best, with the director's visual flair and confident narrative. The space aliens are depicted as ferocious creatures throughout, and this idea works effectively in this genre-merging movie, where no one is safe.<br /><br />Some viewers may want more laughs while others may want more scares. I for one liked the film for what it is, a character-driven action about the protagonist Moses, who changes himself into a real hero. \\"Attack the Block\\" is a hugely entertaining ride.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|ordered the cover for my kindle fire, it does what it does. just like in the picture. nothing really special about it.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|This album is back to the classic Linkin Park of old. I immediately loved all of the songs on the album, unlike their last one, which was somewhat hit or miss with me. I'm a huge LP fan, so I'm really excited that they released another solid album. Well worth the money if you enjoyed their first 3 albums!
B003L77GG0|5.0|I loved this series and really didn't want to see it go off the air.  This last season was one of the best.  It was the perfect ending to a ten year run, each disc makes you relive the last moments of this spectacular show.  The Blur and Green Arrow, made this show a must see for me. I think it was more of a science fiction series than your usual Superman, with all the special effects, aliens, and new gadgets they introduced all the time. Of Course, there was the romance between Clark Kent (Tom Welling) and Lois Lane (Erica Dorrance) that developed much further in this series than any other movie or series before it, they were the best episodes of all, especially the fact they let them finally get married.  This disc set of dvd's is great, beautiful picture and sound, it arrived before the delivery date, and in perfect condition.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I waited awhile before writing a review, because a lot of good things need time to absorb before you can really begin to appreciate them.  My initial thoughts on this album were the same as many I suspect - where is the old Rush sound?  Why am I not hearing songs that sound like Limelight or Spirit of Radio?  Simple answer, this is 2012 and it's Clockwork Angels.  It's not 1981 and Moving Pictures.  Like a lot of people I had become a creature of habit, and music listening was no exception.  I would listen to the same albums over and over from the Golden Era of Rush (1976 - 1981, I don't think many would argue with that), and each time a new album came out I would inevitably start comparing it to the work from this period to see if it stacked up.  Eventually it occurred to me that if I wanted to hear songs that had the old Rush flavor, I would have to listen to those albums specifically and stop trying to look for it in the newer material.  This is a band that thinks and challenges, and looks for different ways to write and play.  If you insist that a band make the same album over and over again, go listen to AC/DC.<br /><br />That said, this is a very good album and has a lot going for it.  Even though there may be no instantly memorable riffs or hooks in this collection, the playing is very tight and the musicianship always shines through.  The guitar and drum work is solid, and there are some killer bass lines on more than a few tracks.  I've read some reviews that complain about fuzzy or distorted sounds on the mix, and frankly I don't know what they're talking about.  It may not be the crystal clear perfect sound that Moving Pictures achieved, but it's certainly not the muddled recording that Signals was either.  Along with all the good, I'll objectively admit there are several things I don't particularly like.  For one, the strange echo effect that Geddy uses on portions of his vocals during several tracks, as if he's talking through a computer or something.It's an effect that's been utilized multiple times on their last few albums, and I don't really understand or care for it.  Fortunately it's kept to a minimum, and although I wish it were gone entirely there is something missing that I wish would come back entirely - Alex Lifeson's great guitar solos.  He does pull off a few decent ones on a couple of tracks, but the man is way too talented and has written too many great solos to go cold turkey on the subject.  He may never reach the peaks of La Villa, Freewill, or Analog Kid again, but I still want to see him attempt the climb.<br /><br />In the end, all the positives far outweigh any negatives and Clockwork Angels is definitely worth the money to buy and time to listen.  Unless you were a gomer and downloaded or heard the whole thing for free online, in which case it's just worth the time to listen to.  I just hope another five years doesn't elapse before another album is released, albeit with more solos and less echoes.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|If you ever wanted to be inspired this is the book to read. One man's triumph in the midst of a host of trouble. One of the greatest testaments of a man's legacy is what others say about him. This man lighted the way for others who struggle. Very good book. It was well written and I highly recommend it to be added to anyone's library of books to read and pass on.

I feel cheated!!!

B006LSZECO|3.0|I honestly don't know how to rate this book. I'm giving it a 3 because the writing is excellent and the suspense is amazing. Halfway through the book I was telling everyone how wonderful it is. Then I got to the last few chapters and, honestly, I was nearly breathless with anticipation - and it just ended. Nothing, nada, zilch. No climax, no resolution, nothing. It was a good thing I read it on my Kindle or I would have thrown it out the window.<br /><br />There is no denying it is well written and has a terrific plot. Now, looking back on it, I can say, well, that was an interesting way to end it but emotionally it was awful. Sort of like making out with the partner of your dreams and then they fall asleep when you are really fired up. Oh well...
B007SGM084|5.0|First time I read these books, I was shocked and couldn't put them down. The second time I read them, I saw the characters in a much better light.

They are so good!!

B00001U0E1|4.0|It's been some time since I've watched this movie.  I saw it when it originally came out, pretty much went on with life, and recently watched it again 12 years later. Twelve years ago, I don't think it impressed me as much as it did recently.  That's probably because my life has changed, my views on love, and especially my experience in writing fiction. In spite of the recent controversy stirred by the movie Anonymous, one cannot help but honor the true writer of the wonderful works of Shakespeare.<br /><br />The brilliance behind this movie is that it's about the author who writes the tragedy, while he lives out his own tragedy with the woman he loves. Their love affair ensues and so does the inspiration for William's penning of Romeo and Juliet.  As the story evolves, so does the tragic truth that they will never be together.  He is bound by a previous marriage and lives a life of a lowly playwright and poet, while the woman he loves is bound by the Queen's command and her father to wed another. The stage is set for a love affair that ends in loss and separation. He writes the sad ending to Romeo and Juliet that a man cannot live without the woman he loves, mirroring the pain of his own soul.<br /><br />When William's play of Romeo and Juliet finally meets the stage, by strange circumstances their lives play out before the audience. Will as Romeo and Viola as Juliet. Their hearts are torn playing their parts, as they both know their lives will be torn asunder as soon as the play ends. Each are forced to follow another path -- two star-crossed lovers never able to have one another just like the tragedy of who they portray on stage.<br /><br />As far as the rest, I wasn't enthralled with seeing Colin Firth act like a sod. Judy Dench was fine, as usual.  Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush were their usual on film. It seems as if their personalities are always the same no matter what the role. Joseph Fiennes as William Shakespeare was far more believable, I thought. The perfect picture of the tortured writer, searching for his muse, passionate about life and storytelling, and always living life from one extreme of comedy to tragedy. That's the beauty of it all.e perfect picture of the tortured writer, searching for his muse, passionate about life and storytelling, and always living life from one extreme of comedy to tragedy.

B004SIP9RO|5.0|I love it when a book or movie elicits strong reaction on both sides of the fence. In today's society the idea of \\"soul mates,\\" \\"fated as lovers,\\" and \\"made for each other,\\" is pretty much...dead. There are more broken relationship in the world than you can shake a stick at.  So when a movie like Serendipity comes along and presents the notion that you don't have to settle for second best, and something in your gut tells you the chance of a life time slipped through your fingers on one cold winter's night, you have a choice.  It's a fantasy-filled love story of possibilities or a bunch of idiotic trash depending on whether you wear those rose-colored glasses in life or not.<br /><br />Where do I stand? I'm one of the disenchanted in the realm of love that believes in soul mates, fated lovers, and the made for each other mentality. I do believe something can spark in the heart of two people who meet and instantly know they'd be good together, even if it's only in one night. Enter Serendipity.<br /><br />However, life isn't that simple.  They are attached to others and about to be married.  Haunted by the possibilities, as they accept the less-than-perfect mates they are about to marry (and let's hear a cheer this happens before they are married), they embark on finding that elusive individual they met years ago. Impossible?  Probably.  Hard to believe they did find each other? Yes.  Yet, this is make-believe.  It's a movie, not reality, and is meant to leave you warm and fuzzy inside or disgruntled over the load of crap you just watched.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie sits at the top of my favorites for romantic comedies for many personal reasons.  John Cusack, as usual, is terrific. The comedy is sweet. The frustration believable. That crazy book with the inside cover you're waiting for him to flip over and see fated writing inside - terrific.  Especially, when he receives it as a wedding present from his fiancee. Yes, two people get hurt, but better yet saved from marrying someone who carried doubts and unresolved \\"what if's\\" into a marriage that probably would not have lasted anyway.<br /><br />(Sara) You don't have to understand.

B0088P2A7A|5.0|Have found several issues and subjects clearly described. This item should be on everyones desktop along with a dictionary. Works well on Kindle Fire.

B007HJ98XC|4.0|This episode rocked. Not as bad as the rest when it came to innuendos. The commander played an excellent role and its a great episode to watch in the winter.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|lots of fun but it crashes on Kindle Fire after playing two or three boards. if this is fixed, I'd give it 5 stars.
1591396190|5.0|perfect. great. excellent... couldnt have asked for better. terrific. quality. exciting. unbeleivable. value for money. never seen a more comprehensive book. uncompromising.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I can not believe how good this is if I turn it off it still works I love this app give it a try it will wake you up
B000Y0S72O|4.0|Interesting idea for this episode but it got boring at parts. Still neat with some cool scenes thou! I especially liked the scene in future SGC and the raid at the beginning.
B0086700CM|5.0|yes it is a repetitive game but it's fun. a good game for wasting time. I play on the crapper all the time. definitely 5 stars!
B000Y0Q6A4|5.0|Pretty sweet episode. Good plot, excellent scifi stuff. I can't wait to see how SG1 solves this problem they happened to cause in future episodes!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Another great book by Gillian Flynn.  I love how this book would go back and forth between the husband and the wife and of course I had already formed an opinion then BAM, I was completely wrong.  Suspense, drama, intrigue, and sheer craziness...I loved every word of it.
B000Y0VU64|1.0|Ugh, probably the most frustrating episode I've ever watched and hope to watch of SG1 anymore. If not for the fact I wish to watch every episode, I would have quickly moved to the next. As usual, Daniel acts more self-centered than ever and disregards the safety of the whole team, which is absolutely repulsive to me. SGC should have gone in to rescue SG1 and wasted anyone in their way. Ugh, I just don't like the way Daniel acts, whether it is a good action, he generally puts the whole team at risk which was quickly seen within the first 2 minutes of the episode.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It does what it says it does. I got it when it was FAOTD, but I would have gladly pay for it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|good app.  simple and useful.  should come standard on the kindle.  hope they can make it happen.  awesome and easy.
B008K8H9C6|5.0|Now give the nice company your dollar and play the game.  You can create, share and download new levels as well and given the companies history I'm sure there will be lots of content updates
B007X4ECMI|3.0|\\"Withen the last hour there's been a massive infraction on super-max<br />MS1. It's a takeover.\\" Snow (Pearce) is a former CIA agent who has been<br />wrongly convicted of a crime. His sentence is 30 years in a cryogenic<br />chamber that is in a floating ship 50 miles above the Earth. While he<br />is waiting for his sentence to begin the president's daughter (Grace)<br />is conducting interviews in the prison to see if it's humane or not.<br />When an interview goes bad and the prisoners are freed there is only<br />one man that can rescue her. Going in I was thinking it was going to be<br />like \\"The Rock\\" in space. I was wrong. While it did have the aspect of<br />someone breaking into prison to get hostages out this was far more<br />sci-fi (I know...it's supposed to be) and really not comparable to each<br />other. I have to say that the action was good and if you can suspend<br />reality for awhile they you will like this. I found that the movie<br />tended to drag a little in some parts but what really kept it going was<br />the dialog. Guy Pearce doesn't usually do movies like this but he was<br />really good and had great delivery of the one liners. There are many<br />scenes that make you wonder if what you are seeing is possible, but for<br />one it is a movie so you have to suspend disbelief for a little while.<br />Also the movie is pretty entertaining throughout and the unbelievable<br />sequences actually help a movie like this. Who knows, maybe in the<br />future this stuff is possible. Overall, an entertaining sci-fi movie<br />that is worth watching, but not really more then once. I give it a B.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My sister recommended this book to me & I am so glad she did.  The book is well written & full of twists & turns I did not see coming.  I have read MANY crime,suspense & mystery novels and I usually have it figured out half way through.  Not with this book.  It is a quick easy read that keeps you engaged.
0887306667|4.0|Written in 1993, by Al Ries and Jack Trout (the authors of Positioning and Focus) the book, in just over 100 pages, is a kind of summary useful to everybody working in marketing departments (from young PMs to expert Brand and Marketing Managers) and/or interested in this subject.<br /><br />The formula used to describe each of the 22 laws is: first the statement, then its \\"practical application\\" describing a series of \\"worst practices\\" when not respected.<br /><br />In particular, I consider as the most important these laws:<br /><br /># 1 \\"of Leadership\\": \\"It's better to be first than it is to be better\\";<br /><br /># 3 \\"of the Mind\\": \\"It's better to be first in the mind (of customers) than to be first in the marketplace\\";<br /><br /># 12 \\"of Line Extension\\": \\"There's an irresistible pressure to extend the equity of the brand\\";<br /><br /># 15 \\"of Candor\\": \\"When you admit a negative, theprospect will give you a positive\\"<br /><br />and finally the ONE I consider as the fundamental law of marketing:<br /><br /># 4 \\"of Perception\\": \\"Marketing is NOT a battle of products, it's a battle of perceptions.\\"<br /><br />The authors' conclusion is that the 22 laws are immutable and always valid so: \\"violate them at your own risk\\"!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|i love this book!  Do not listen to all the childish Yawn's and negative feed back. This is a book for adults with knowledge and an open mind to also learn about new subjects and  also read a wonderful story!! i can  barely put it down and cant wait to read book two . this is not a book for a bubble chewing teen unless their IQ is above average ENJOY !!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|A real mystery buff, I fell for all the hype and good reviews about this book and eagerly started to reading it on my Kindle Fire.  Halfway through, I started skimming, and finally read a few lines on every page.  Not only did I feel no empathy for a single character in the book, the story went on and on and seemed incapable of coming to a conclusion (and believe me, I was ready for one).  What could have been a great psychological thriller with lots of twists and turns was instead a barely interesting, dragged out story that I  quickly lost interest in.  There were all kinds of opportunities to jazz up the story and pull the reader in, but none came to fruition.  What sad, sad characters these people were, and how sorry I felt for them being stuck in such a lame brain  drawn out story.
1846556694|4.0|This book is certainly not an easy summer read-- it is very time consuming and sometimes almost frustrating because of its slow pace. That being said, it is written beautifully and although each minute detail eventually feels somewhat superfluous, the story still maintains a certain powerful literary quality because of the unique usage of symbolism, imagery, and the various literary references it involves. There were times where I would simply sit and think about all of the book's imagery and the themes Murakami imbues. Definitely a thought-provoking work.<br /><br />Personally, I found Book 3 to be quite frustrating because 1 and 2 build up quite beautifully but then the momentum of it all slows down significantly in Book 3. Overall though, I enjoyed the novel and I would recommend 1Q84 to those who enjoyed George Orwell's 1984, since they do reference his work at certain points and the storyline somewhat alludes to Orwell's characters and themes.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|First of all, I love the Bruckner Symphonies. For anyone who is truly interested in these works I would suggest this box set without hesitation. The price is hard to beat and the performances rank among the best available. The seasoned Brucknerian will have his or her own preferences of conductor, orchestra and interpretive approach. There are many great recordings of these Symphonies.<br />Herbert Von Karajan's way with Bruckner was magisterial. Forget about what may turn you off about him and just listen to the music. Karajan had a deep understanding of Bruckner's art. He bled it. Like many great conductors of this music, the proof is in the ability to carry the line and join the often difficult parts of the scores. Karajan seemed to do this without any trouble at all because he knew where the key moments lay and how to maintain pulse in transitions. There is depth of feeling, nobility and power. Whatever is required, the Berlin Philharmonic and Karajan provide.<br />The audio quality is not perfect. In some of the Symphonies the brass is a bit severe. I don't mind this but it may bother some listeners. Symphonies 1,2 and 3 are given dramatic and satisfying performances. The 4th is faster than Karajan and the BPO's legendary EMI recording. It's exciting and spontaneous sounding. This 5th is perfectly recorded. It is the long view of the work. They take their time and it pays off. This is one of the finest 5th's committed to disc. I like this version of the 6th very much. Some have said that Karajan did not succeed in pulling off this so-called elusive score. I think he did just fine. The slow movement is absolutely profound. It's as deep as the ocean. You should not listen to this stuff while driving. The 7th is very good. One may prefer the great EMI version but this one holds it's own. The mighty 8th Symphonie is given a distinguished rendering. It is not the best I have ever heard but it's close. The 9th, that craggy, sublime, unpolished gem of a piece is givena performance for the ages. This 9th has perfect sound quality.<br />The 5th is divided into discs 1 and 2. The 8th is also divided into dics 4 and 5. All of the other works are fit onto single CD's. A minor quibble. I have chosen not to mention other performers and recordings. I have preferences  other than Karajan and the BPO in some of these scores. However, this box-set is of consistantly high standard in every work. For me, there is not a dud in the bunch.<br />Thank you for reading this review and keep listening to great music!<br />  God Bless,<br />  KJM
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing! very well written! The first book is a shocker but you have to read all 3 to get the full affect!!

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game app, but once I started playing this game for awhile-and I'm talking about not even 2 days awhile-it started skipping on me! I still really love this game and it is still really addictive.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I usually don't like the \\"find the object\\" games because they're so repetitive. I enjoy finding hidden objects in pictures and searching for differences, but can usually only do that for so long before I get bored.<br /><br />Not so with this game. The storyline made me want to keep going so I can see what happens next. It made it much more interesting than just looking for hidden objects. The mini games were somewhat interesting, but a little frustrating at times.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good game with a decent story.
B005ONTD42|5.0|At First Im skeptical of this thing. But when I watched the videos of what it can do, I am very amazed. A robot ball that can do a lot of stuff. I feel that this thing is alive. And I talk to it sometimes. I feel that I own my very first pet. I read some bad reviews, they just don't know how this robot ball are capable of, because they just looked in the outside that it was just a ball, but on the inside it's an amazing technology, a Robot. By the way It's my birthday today. This is the first gift that I give to myself. I hope that my friend buy Sphero too so we can race, that would be a lot of fun. NP is the Best, just saying. ^_^
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Can be time consuming but is great fun for the kids and me. Was a little worried about the kids purchasing things until I found out I can password restrict through my Kindle Fire by turning on the parental control setting. Now if only it would stop the occasional freezing.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I upgraded from my Droid, purchased 3 years ago, to the new LG Spectrum 4G LTE. Obviously, having so much extra capability equates to increased taxation on the battery. Battery HD has proven to be an outstanding utility, helping ensure that I have enough battery strength to handle the things I need to to from my Mobile device. This is a well thought-out app. Covers all bases functionally. Adds a level of control to the user that's just not there but SHOULD BE. On top LG that, Battery HD is aesthetically pleasing, also allowing u to control how, what, and where the app displays. Awesome work, tip of my hat to dev.
B005LAII08|2.0|Pixar's first tale to center on a female heroine introduces us to Merida, who is, ironically enough, an adventurous tomboy. She loathes her loving mother (the queen) for pushing her into the very feminine royal life laid out for her based on the traditions of her people. This resentment eventually boils over, and Merida rides off into the woods in an act of protest. During this glorified tantrum, she stumbles upon a mysterious group of stones and magical blue 'wisp' creatures. These beings lead Merida to the cabin of a bumbling witch with a penchant for spells. Merida strikes a deal with her to 'change her destiny' in exchange for a valuable necklace. Of course the new destiny is worse than her original one so Merida spends the rest of the movie trying to, as Bay-Staters know how to say all too well, 'reverse the curse!'<br /><br />As usual for Pixar, the animation is nothing short of breathtaking. A young girl sitting behind me at the theater gasped \\"So beautiful!\\" when the film opened to a stunning shot of an animated Scottish coastal community. The way the animators craft the different settings for our characters in such vivid color and detail is almost worth the price of admission alone...almost.<br /><br />Where the film falters is with both the overall pacing and with the development of an antagonist. The beginning of the movie seems to drag, especially for a fairy tale geared at young children. The first hour could have been told in half the time, and gets quite repetitive as it drives home the point that Merida is not happy with her life. She is like the child version of Elizabeth Gilbert from Eat, Pray, Love - both being whiny characters that have so much yet want something different. Once Brave does begin to move along plotwise, it becomes a disjointed tale in search of a villain. Is it the witch? The demon bear? The queen? Merida herself? Maybe all of them? The narrative doesn't take the time to establish any one evil to root against, which leaves older, more mature viewers a little impartial to the outcome.<br /><br />For a story so lacking in a developed villain, it is surprisingly violent, taking advantage of every last bit of the 'PG' rating. From constant sword/fist/bear fights to one character getting crushed to death by a large stone, I was taken aback by how far Pixar took the intensity of this story. While other Pixar movies have had dramatic scenes, this one strikes me as the first I would say real young children would not enjoy seeing. I wish the film had leaned more on the humor, because when Brave tries to be funny, it succeeds brilliantly. There are a few comical sequences with devious little triplets that save the film from being a complete disaster.<br /><br />All that criticism aside, this is a perfect movie for preteen/middle school girls who can handle cartoon violence and want an ultimately positive message. For the rest of us, Pixar's latest is simply a disappointing Scottish legend that borrows from better animated films of a similar vein (see the far superior [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]]). It's not the worst way to spend your money at the multiplex, but it's certainly not worth rushing out to see if you aren't in the target demographic. In my movie-going opinion, I would give it a 5 out of 10.more mature viewers a little impartial to the outcome.<br /><br />For a story so lacking in a developed villain, it is surprisingly violent, taking advantage of every last bit of the 'PG' rating.

B004I8WD6E|1.0|the screen protector sucks very bad.  picks up dust and then its not worth putting it on....soooo many bubbles and not all go away.  the case itself is okay but not to my preference.  its very simple and dull.  the plastic is cheap and i jus hated it.
B002RI9HUM|3.0|I enjoyed the characters and the witty writing style but found this tale of an addict discovering herself a bit light for the topic.

034580404X|5.0|I absolutely love this series!! I'm on the second book and it's so hard to put them down once you start reading!! Well written and easy flowing.

I also love all the characters you get to play as, the football player, the women, and the original man.Lastly,I like the price,it is like buying an awesome game, for a extermely low price.
1451627289|5.0|King is Back!! I have read the Dome, Now this book 11-23-63. Incredible, Time travel at the Finest!!! What a journey King takes you on in this story.Details from years gone by is amazing, I do not think he left anything out! His characters come to life in the fullest form. What I love about his writing is how he can give you full detail of the people in the story and hold NO Judgement on them. I think King has to be a very compassionate man to be able to do this. Even though the story revolves around Kennedy's Assassination, and going through time travel to try and change the past,  in the middle of the story and in the end it becomes more about who Jake Epping (George Amberson) is as a man. I loved the fact that King had this Romantic twist to this story. What a great story teller, he makes this story seem, not so far fetched.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Everyone told me that I had to read this trilogy because it was sooooo good.  All three books are crap.  The writing is bad and the plot is repetative.  The female lead in this book is spinless and can not think on her own.  Why are women turned on by a story of a female being bossed around by an egotistical male?  I would never recommend these books to anyone.  I wish I did not buy them on the Kindle so I could burn them.
0345803485|1.0|It's pretty hard to write a book that is so boring, despite being packed full of explicit sex.  50 shades is so repetitive and moronic, it just didn't capture my interest at all.  Truly a book written for idiots.  The characters are completely unrealistic, and the plot is pure formula.  Yuck.  Save your $10 and the time you would waste reading this book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is brilliant unfolding the story of Jake Epping's time travel through the rabbit Hole.  Every interaction the main character took had the potential of changing the future in unimaginable ways. King does a great job of tying it all up in a very well thought out plan.  Stephen paints every character as interesting and vibrant with style.  We soon grow to care about George, Saddie, Al, miss Mimi and Deke.  They all become dear to the reader.  I would love to see the novel 11/22/1963 by Stephen King become a movie.

0670023329|5.0|Not very often do I sit up all night to read a book cover-to-cover, but this is one of them.  I found this book by accident, but I am so very glad that I did.  The horrors of existence in the labor camps sickened me to my very core, and the knowledge that we appease the brutal government that abuses and tortures its people is all the more sickening.  Because of this book I am going to volunteer for various groups that help refugees from North Korea.  Shin's story is painful, but it is one that must be told.  I just not have to find a way to incorporate this book into my college classes.

0131479415|5.0|Excellent book. Sincerely I see how it inspired other books[[ASIN:B007YUNT5C Scrum, The Complete Overview and Guide (Boxset), For the Agile Scrum Master, Product Owner, Stakeholder and Development Team (inspired by Ken Schwaber, Mike Cohn, Jeff Sutherland)]]
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was curious to read this book as there was an awful lot of hype and publicity about it, even on the news. I knew a little about the story line and what to expect but what I didn't expect was it to be so poorly written. The reason I say that is because the characters are not developed to accomplish any credibility in my opinion. Basically it's just about sadism and masochism.
0345803485|1.0|I bought into all the hype and purchased the book for my kindle.  By chapter 16 I had no desire to continue reading. The plot is unrealistic and at times the material is often rediculous.  I would not recommend this book at all.
1781161097|5.0|The film Prometheus has a very strong design aesthetic, so naturally I was interested in this book. I love it just as much as the movie. Some of the sets they made are astounding and you get a good look at them here, as well as lots of design concepts from creatures to spaceships to uniforms. Comprehensive and very cool. Wait till you see the red ECO suits that Ridley Scott now keeps in his office! And who knew one guy made all those ampule capsules in ceramic by spinning them on a pottery wheel. I love learning little tidbits like that - did you know that tracked ATV they made was real and could go 50 mph? - you will if you buy this! Great book that I will treasure forever.

Not to sure if I'll read the second book though.
0345803485|1.0|Did I repeat myself in the title.  I decided to write like this crappy author, and just reapeat every word 50 times in the hopes of making a long boring book, filled with the most powerful orgasms a woman can have by the biggest penis imaginable a man can have, and blush 200 times.  I can't believe Hollywood is making a movie from garbage like this.  After 3/4 of the way in, I was lucky enough to be able to send this back fgor a full refund.  SAVE YOUR MONEY

B0065IA4F2|5.0|I have to admit that I wasn't a big fan of Drake prior to purchasing this album. I liked his song \\"Best I Ever Had\\" but other than that, I wasn't very interested in his music.<br /><br />One night a post appeared on my Facebook wall that Amazon was offering this album for 25¢, so of course I was like \\"Well, I'll give it a go!\\" I have to say that it was a wonderful investment. My perception of Drake's music has changed dramatically after this purchase. I see him now not only as a rapper, but a 'floetrist.' He actually SAYS something within his lyrics. He may sometimes speak of adult situations but he doesn't go over the top with it as many artists do. My favorite songs on this album are \\"Headlines,\\" \\"Marvin's Room,\\" and \\"Hyfr.\\"<br /><br />Thanks to a GREAT Amazon promotion, Drake got a new fan!
B00006B1OQ|5.0|I bought the CD when it first came out, but didn't listen to it. I just couln't bring myself to listen to it because of the sadness of 9/12 accociated with The Rising. I recently decided that now was the time to listen as it is an election year and the 9/11 memorial is completed. I was very emotionally affected by the beauty of the music and the profound understanding of emptiness that comes from losing a loved one. Paradise is possibly the most haunting song that I have ever heard. Worlds Apart is truly stunning musically and lyrically. Bruce manages to evoke the name of Allah and get away with it.<br /><br />Everyone 's own opinion is a valid one for themselves, but I just don't see how this could be considered a one-star album. I save that designation for Justin Bieber records.
1595828753|1.0|How can I say this...this book is garbage. On the surface it's harmless enough, and enjoyable enough. However, Gene Yang spends most of his time either glorifying his own characters, or giving the spotlight to a character I couldn't remember for the life of me, and debasing established characters. The main five are good and fine enough, but the moment Zuko get's involved everything falls to pot. Zuko going to his father is just...stupid. After he repeatedly advocated the murder of the man, he's suddenly going to him for advice? And what about Mai? She gets a single page, and that single page shows why exactly this comic is terrible. Gene Yang does not understand the characters. Or, at the very least, he doesn't care to focus on the characters he doesn't like. Newsflash Mr Yang, this is a book for the fans of Avatar, not your pet project. This is a book for fans that enjoyed ALL the characters from the original show. And yes, some of them were fans of Mai and Ty Lee, and don't appreciate how poorly you've written them.<br /><br />The original characters wouldn't be a problem, if they weren't so awful. Kori is an obnoxious, self righteous piece of crap that should have had a meeting with the royal executioner after attacking her rule. And the rest are just so boring. They barely make it past the stereotype phase, and when they do it's poorly written.<br /><br />I would say don't waste your money, but we all know we need to know how it ends. If nothing else than to see if Mike and Bryan undo the damage caused by Yang. What was anyone involved with this thinking? That fans would appreciate this kind of crap? Apparently so, because nobody else is pointing out what a horribly written mess this is. Just...read it to find out what happens, and hate it all the while. I had been thinking of trying out Yang's other work, but if it's as bad as what we see here he doesn't deserve the money it would cost me to buy his crap.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is good if you take the characters from a young love perspective. Loved the plot, the characters and the ending it all came together very nicely . I wished there was .

0307887448|2.0|After reading some initial reviews, I had high hopes for the novel. I was pretty disappointed.<br /><br />First, the good news: The novel moves along like very well. It would be a good book to pick up at the airport newsstand if you want to forget you are flying from San Antonio to Milwaukee. It would also not be worth the effort to carry it off the plane when you finished.<br /><br />But as chipper as the protagonist tries to be about his universe, it is an incredibly dismal, derivative and ultimately  tawdry place. Imagine a world where the highest ideals of mankind are expressed in 80's video game culture. The dialog is about as deep as Pacman and Mario.<br /><br />It feels like a cheesy script for a B-list summer blockbuster.<br /><br />The cover blurb compares it to the Matrix. Ir reads like a cheap rip-off of The Hunger Games. HINT: Instead of reading a book that praises William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, READ William Gibson and Neal Stephenson. Or if dystopia is your thing, might I suggest Margaret Atwood?
0143038419|5.0|A few years ago, a good friend told me she really didn't like the writing style of this book, so I put off picking it up. When another friend loved it and urged me to read it, I picked it up and am so thankful. Such an intriguing insight into the multilevel journey of a strongly-voiced writer. Makes me want to travel more, explore more, love more and eat, eat, eat ;)
B00000JRTX|1.0|I thought this would be a good movie as I usually like Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell, but it was awful. I feel asleep during the first 30 minutes of this movie the first time I watched it. So, I watched it again and it was still a bad film. Andie was very stiff with her lines and the characters (especially hers) were unlikeable to say the least. Won't waste my time watching this one again!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My wife bought it, without my knowledge, as airplane reading. I couldn't resist taking a peek. I couldn't believe my eyes. It's the worst writing possible. And the sex - I feel sorry for anyone who is arroused by such drivel
B004EPYZU8|4.0|SuckerPunch is an interesting film. You become a part of a mentally confusing adventure about a girl who, through no fault of her own, ends up in an institution for the mentally insane. Distraught over the loss of her mother and sister and recently attacked by her step-father, Baby Doll (the main character) invents a world inside the asylum to help her cope with the terrifying situation in which she finds herself.<br /><br />It's not entirely clear if some of the things portrayed actually happened, but it is implied that some of the events she instigates occurred. This is what makes the film so interesting.<br />Granted, the costumes and the fantasy worlds Baby Doll shows us could be considered simply \\"fan-service\\" for the typical anime/fantasy/videogame lover, however I feel that THAT is what makes the film so visually appealing. The transitions from muted tones and gritty textures to bright lights and colorful show-costumes serve as a helper to the viewer to determine between what is seems to be real and what is not.<br /><br />Despite the tragedy that occurs in this film, the ending is bittersweet and closes with an answer to the opening questions: \\"\\"Who Honors those we love for the very life we live? Who sends monsters to kill us...and at the same time sings that we'll never die? Who teaches us what's real...and how to laugh at lies? Who decides why we live and what we'll die to defend? Who chains us...and who holds the key that can set us free?\\"<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this film. It is not to be taken too seriously, but still offers something meaningful.  4 stars.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I loved this!  The humor, the time period and it took a modern young woman into a magical time period where she got the man of her dreams!!!

B0086700CM|4.0|After reading other reviews I was skeptically but I have had no loading or content issues with the app. The game runs smooth and is enjoyable. I like that it is different every time you play. Good job with this one.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|This is a great album with a hint of the first album high vocals and driving guitars, but also with a bit of grunge like their last couple albums. I still like the early per-releases of BY2B and Caravan the best and was somewhat disappointed the other songs didn't quite hold up the quality of these two songs. Wish Them Well is probably the next best song with The Antichrist coming in fourth. This is probably unfair to those of you who like the new Rush-grunge experiment, but I think Rush should stick to what their good at; driving hard rock and soft ballads! Overall, I give this album a B on memorability. Its a good attempt, which could have been great if all the songs went back to their rockin' roots of Working Man.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Just love the CD. I play it in my car all the time and must have nearly worn it out.  A very good CD and very enjoyable to listen to especially when driving.
1455523003|5.0|Christopher Hitchens iconoclastic polemic against Mother Teresa makes for riveting reading. Uncomfortable questions are raised that beget even more uncomfortable answers. An icon suffers from the harsh gaze of an unsentimental critic.<br /><br />Given Christopher Hitchen's strong atheist views, it is perhaps not surprising and even inevitable that he would have trained his guns on Mother Teresa at some point. Mother Teresa was the brightest beacon of the Church in Asia, a continent where the Church remains convinced a \\"great harvest\\" of heathen souls awaits in the new millennium. What does surprise, however, is the persuasiveness of the author's arguments, the polemic against the Saint of the Gutters. At the end of this short book - all of 128 pages, I was more convinced that there had been something fundamentally fake about Mother Teresa, and more's the pity, since she commanded the kind of attention and following that could have been used for effecting great, and good, change for the poor.<br /><br />Hitchens takes Mother Teresa to task on several accounts. For pretending to be apolitical but not averse to lobbying politicians to further her and the Church's agenda. For denying basic humanitarian care to the poor and dying while enjoying the most expensive medical care that money could buy. For perpetuating the myth of Calcutta being a \\"hell-hole\\". For rushing to the aid of the despot, the criminal, the dictator. For abrogating to herself the role of being God's chosen voice on Earth. For pursuing a particularly fundamentalist, orthodox, and intolerant doctrine of Christianity. Lastly, the citizenry of the world, too enamoured of the Mother to cast a critical eye on her deeds.<br /><br />Mother Teresa commanded power, love, and respect, from her followers. Whether she was humbled by it, or whether she truly believed herself as deserving of that veneration is quite another thing. The author, however, notes, unimpressed, \\"I did not particularly care for the way that she took kisses bestowed on her sandalled feet as no more than her due.\\"<br /><br />Mother Teresa received enormous funds, donations, and patronage from the Government of India while she was alive. That money, Hitchens says, has never been totaled, nor has anyone \\"ever asked what became of the funds. It is safe to say, however, that if all the money had been used on one project it would have been possible, say, to give Calcutta the finest teaching hospital in the entire Third World.\\" The wretched, unhygienic conditions, in which the poor were given less than basic care, left one wondering why Mother Teresa thought it fit that the poor should be subjected to such pain in their dying moments, while she herself didn't think twice before availing of the best and most expensive medical care that money could buy (\\"who herself, it should be noted, has checked into some of the finest and costliest clinics and hospitals in the West during her bouts with heart trouble and old age\\"). The poor, on the other hand,  had to make do with simple painkillers \\"for the sort of pain that goes with terminal cancer and the things they were dying of.\\"<br /><br />Even more damning, to use this loaded word in the context of talking about Mother Teresa, is the testimony of \\"Susan Shields, who for nine and a half years worked as a member of Mother Teresa's order, living the daily discipline of a Missionary of Charity in the Bronx, in Rome and in San Francisco.\\"<br />Susan Shields wrote,<br />\\"In the homes for the dying, Mother taught the sisters how to secretly baptize those who were dying. Sisters were to ask each person in danger of death if he wanted a 'ticket to heaven'. An affirmative reply was to mean consent to baptism. The sister was then to pretend she was just cooling the person's forehead with a wet cloth, while in fact she was baptizing him, saying quietly the necessary words. Secrecy was important so that it would not come to be known that Mother Teresa's sisters were baptizing Hindus and Moslems.\\"<br />This was more like the last in a long line of insults the poor had to endure - deprived during their lives by a corrupt and indifferent government of opportunities to live a better life, deprived while dying of basic medical care that Mother Teresa's millions could have provided, and cheated at death, secretly and surreptitiously baptized, without their consent, to a faith that had been alien all their lives.<br /><br />Mother Teresa's lasting legacy is perhaps her blind faith in the infallibility of dogma. The dogma of the Church. While she may have proclaimed herself as apolitical, it did not stop her from meeting with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the eve of a private bill in Parliament that sought to \\"limit the availability of abortion\\". This was appreciated by the M.P. who had brought the bill as providing an \\"immense boost to his campaign\\". Nor did the she blink an eyelid when stating that she would have \\"sided with the Church authorities against Galileo.\\" To add to this litany, and 'litany' is again a loaded word here, Hitchens  notes, Mother Teresa was silent about the genocide in Rwanda, \\"perhaps because the Roman Catholic leadership in that country was complicit in the attempted genocide of the Tutsi people in the summer of 1994.\\"<br /><br />Mother Teresa's conveniently blind side, consistently poor judgment, persistent dogma, call it what you will, did not confine itself only to theological matters. If it was her rather artless, or as Hitchens says, \\"faux naif\\", letter she wrote in defense of Mr Charles Keating, a fraudster convicted to stealing over $200 million, it was her very public support for Jean-Claude Duvalier of Haiti at another. Even sadder is her defense of the butchers of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy of 1984. \\"Mother Teresa was on the next plane to Bhopal. At the airport, greeted by throngs of angry relatives of the victims, she was pressed to give her advice and counsel, and she did so unhesitatingly. I have a videotape of the moment. 'Forgive,' she said. 'Forgive, forgive.'\\" Forgive? Forgive whom? Forgive for what? How did she know, at that time, that Union Carbide, now owned by Dow Chemical, was responsible for the deaths of eventually over one hundred thousand people? \\"Mother Teresa's flying visit to Bhopal read like a hasty exercise in  damage control \\" Should the poor have to forgive the rich, the powerful, the culpable? In Hitchens' excoriating words, Mother Teresa \\"furnished PR-type cover for all manner of cultists and shady businessmen (who are often the same thing)\\".<br /><br />Hitchens notes that Mother Teresa and the Church's defense of the unborn was laudable, whatever one may think of the Mother herself - \\"there is none the less something impressive and noble in the high priority the Church gives to potential life\\". Yet India was also witness to Mrs. Indira Gandhi, late Prime Minister of India, and \\"friend and admirer\\" of Mother Teresa, who \\"who launched a demagogic and brutal attempt to bring about male sterilization.\\" Surely the Mother could have uttered a word or two in criticism? If she ever did, records do not provide any evidence of it. In Bangladesh, where the most violent and sickening of crimes were committed against close to half a million women in 1970-71, Mother Teresa appealed to these victims to \\"not to abort the seed of the invader and the violator\\". It is quite another thing that Mother Teresa claimed to have adopted no more than \\"three or four dozen orphans from the entire Bangladesh calamity.\\" This out of hundreds of thousands of victims.<br /><br />If Mother Teresa was a fake, then valuing a fake as highly as the world did is not her fault alone. After all, as the saying goes, it takes two to tango. \\"If Mother Teresa is the adored object of many credulous and uncritical observers, then the blame is not hers, or hers alone. In the gradual manufacture of an illusion, the conjurer is only the instrument of the audience.\\" We played an equally culpable role in the elevation of Mother Teresa to god-like stature, without critical evaluation.<br /><br />Lastly, Calcutta (now called \\"Kolkata\\") has had to suffer its share of tragedies. Whether it was the partition of Bengal into West Bengal and what later became East Pakistan and then Bangladesh, \\"by a stupid British colonial decision\\", the upheaval caused by the Bangladesh War in 1971, the sectarian strife in Assam a decade later, or the ignominies heaped on the city and state by Communists, who ruled the state for more than thirty years, it is still \\"the city of Tagore, of Ray and Bose and Mrinal Sen, and of a great flowering of culture and nationalism.\\" The people themselves \\"are neither inert nor cringing. They work and they struggle, and as a general rule (especially as compared with ostensibly richer cities such as Bombay) they do not beg.\\" The manufacture and sustenance of the impression that \\"Calcutta is a hellhole\\" was therefore \\"Essential indeed to the whole Mother Teresa cult.\\"<br /><br />In the end, Hitchens summarization of Mother Teresa is succinct, and more depressingly, accurate - \\"A religious fundamentalist, a political operative, a primitive sermonizer and an accomplice of worldly, secular powers.\\"<br /><br />I now look forward to Hitchens' other book, \\"The Trial of Henry Kissinger\\"!ape of the moment. 'Forgive,' she said. 'Forgive, forgive.'\\" Forgive? Forgive whom? Forgive for what?

B006VA4NJC|5.0|I caught part of this on PBS and wasn't fortunate enough to see the whole season. I waited until I found a free weekend and I watched both seasons of Downton Abbey with Amazon Prime. The cast is brilliant. The characters evolve (which you can see when you watch consecutively over a short period of time) and grow emotionally. Just when you think that you have a character pegged another facet of their nature is revealed and you are surprised. I would recommend this series highly and I can't wait for the third season to come in early 2013. British television does period dramas so beautifully and Dame Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton are priceless.
B0086700CM|3.0|this is a fun and addictive game. lots of glitches and some inaccurate moves and unresponsive swipes. I do still enjoy it though.
B0063BD8UO|5.0|I loved this episode because we got to see The Originals (esp Klaus) before they were vampires, giving us a peek into their world when they were living in Mystic Falls before it even came to be. I love season 3 because the show not only brought in new characters, but took us on a new journey as far as the story line went. I have a feeling this is just a tip of the iceberg as far as what we know about the Originals. They've been alive for so long I'd love to see them with their own spin-off. They have so many more stories to tell.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|OfficeSuite Pro for my ViewSonic G Tablet provides me the option of reviewing and editing MS documents while on the go.  So far I have found no problems other than the standard drawbacks with the tablet format - transferring the document to the tablet is cumbersome and the keyboard, though functional, is almost too tiny for my large-size hands.  If I have substantial editing to do using the G tab, I prefer attaching a USB keyboard with a little more room.  Carrying a keyboard makes the whole system less mobile, however.  Minor editing of a document in OfficeSuite Pro is doable and helpful when I find a few typos or awkward sentance.  Worth the price and works well.
B0086DBE62|5.0|I started the movie not expecting much except a whimsical way to pass an hour and a half, but I was surprised at how much I find myself actually smiling or laughing. While the Queen wasn't particularly funny to me, I thought Julia Roberts played her the way the movie needed. I was glad there wasn't an over-dwelling on the concept of Snow White being the most beautiful at all- in fact, the Prince simply states she is in HIS eyes. Not that she necessarily is to everyone who sees her. This idea of subjective beauty appealed to me quite a bit as between the actresses of Snow White and the Queen, there is a large difference in 'type' of beauty. Over all, the dwarves had a habit of making me grin and the beast was done in wonderful CG. If you expect a ton of character depth...well, that's kind of hard in a story that should feature a minimum of 10 characters (7 dwarves, Snow White, Queen, and Prince). In the end, it's a fairy tale. It's not deep but it's a fun watch. The Bollywood homage at the end was fantastic!

0767836286|5.0|I by-passed this movie several times. I thought it was a Civil War movie because of the title.  Ultimately I bought it because I'm a Jeff Bridges fan.<br /><br />It's been several days since I watched this movie, and I can't stop thinking about all the implications of the events that transpired in this movie.  I keep stringing together \\"what about this . . .\\" and \\"what ifs . . .\\" that go way beyond the movie itself and enter into my everyday life -- the terrorism that has crept into all of our lives since 9/11.<br /><br />I think what is scariest about this movie is the idea that such an educated person could be so easily manipulated and used as a tool for a terrorist group.  If a man who lectures about the perils of terrorism to his students in such a thought-provoking way can be sucked into such a horrible scheme, how do we less-educated or less-perceptive individuals avoid such dangers?  As a parent, I honestly could see myself reacting exactly the same way to the boy in the street, to my child wanting to be included and have more friends, and ultimately to doing anything to protect my child who is in danger.<br /><br />I used to wonder how any rational human being could be sucked into these terrorist groups to the point of turning against their own country.  After watching this movie, it seems like it would be just a matter of finding a person's trigger point.  That scares me.<br /><br />I will be more vigilant and watchful now, more than ever before, but . . . \\"will that save me?\\"  God, I truly do hope so!!!
B0060ICQAI|5.0|Great episode all the way around. They brought back some of my favorite characters in this episode and it even ended on a happy note for some people. But of course, in true TVD fashion, they ended the episode on a note that left you dying to know what was going to happen next. Love this show.
0345803493|5.0|\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" I cannot say enough about this book. It is probably now one of my favorites book ever.  I've read the entire trilogy, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" & \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" all in less than 2 weeks. It was that good and very addictive. Not because of the sex, but because I think this story holds your interest. I always kept wondering where they will end up? How will it all end? I think more so I can relate to the characters in this story so that adds to my love for this book. But besides that, I think its a wonderful unconventional love story. These two fall in love, unexpectedly. And I think their compatible with each other and compliment each other perfectly. I love what someone said earlier about \\"bringing the dark to the light\\" In this book Christian has had such a rough childhood, and is still scarred from that as an adult in the \\"darkness\\" if you will. And Ana much more innocent, brings him to the light in a way. Ana starts off a virgin and experiences all her \\"firsts\\" with him. But even though sexually and other general ways in life Christian is so much more experienced & worldly than her...He still in many ways experiences his \\"firsts\\" with her too. She's his first real relationship instead of \\"subs\\" & she's the first person he really lets in and learns to discover himself, how underneath it all he is a good man, wish a good heart, and he deserved to give and receive love. And their both really learning and growing together which I think is beautiful.<br /><br />I have heard people say that the writing is poor, whatever lol I didn't pick up this book thinking is was a Nobel Prize piece. Come on now! Some people are just overly critical. And you can never satisfy everyone unfortunately. But I do agree some phrases are repetitive, how many times did I read the lip biting lol! Or \\"later's baby\\" lol But in a way I warmed up to the repetitiveness. Why? Because in a way it just felt more comfortable almost as if you know thesepeople. In our daily lives with family and friends things are often repetitive, we can almost predict what our loved ones will say or do sometimes. So as this story goes on especially in the 2nd & 3rd books I felt like i knew these characters and instead of the repetitive phrases rubbing me the wrong way lol No pun intended :P It made me laugh lol Like for instance, whenever their sitting down to eat, i start laughing knowing Christian is gonna get on her to eat! And this goes back to a deep issue he has with his crack head mother, how when she did he went days without food. But it was intense. So many ups & downs. Never a dull moment. Its definitely hard to put this put down once you start. And not just cause of the sex like most people quickly assume. The \\"Sex\\" factor isn't the reason at all I got into this book.<br /><br />Is the writing hot? Yes. But I've done half the stuff in this book so it wasn't like jaw dropping for me. I've never been into the BDSM thing, but it is interesting to read about. lol But still hot writing. Now prudish people or maybe people inexperienced might not be a fan of a book like this or couldn't handle some of its steamy scenes. I never even read an erotic kind of book before. When I first picked up this book, I had no clue what it was about. So many of my friends kept raving how great it was, so that's why I gave it a try. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />And I think it has every aspect that makes a good story...action, drama, romance, sometimes comedy, etc.. It has all those qualities to me. And enjoyed it. I think this book brought me back to reading. When I was a kid i read all the time, would win prizes & awards for it cause i was one of the top readers in the class. But as I got older i almost forgot what its like to just read a good book here and there. And this book brought me back to that. Kudos to E.L. James. Gonna miss my daily Christian Grey fix lol!! Laters baby. :)

0741470314|2.0|Like the other \\"two star\\" reviews...I too was excited about this book and VERY dissapointed. I too...give it 2 stars because it is well intentioned and has a ton of info that a newbie to MJ would like. I do think though that there are repeated issues with the author lacking a true understanding of any of the understory of MJ...saying Al Malnik was a friend...no, MJ dumped him once he realised he was like everyone else...trying to get his paws on the \\"Catalogue\\". allso that he was Mafia and tied to ..well you can imagine. Michael had much history with a evil/demonic part of the music industry and he fought it with every breath he took. I believe it went on for decades.(Hence countless raids on Neverland and two Child Molestation suits) This book to me perpetuates the \\"Fairy Tale\\" that the music industry wants to keep alive about his life. Those that want to not see this Hell he faced daily and tried to protect himself and his family from...can read her book and stay in the bliss of the FAIRY TALE. Yes she goes into the trial and his awful experieces..how could one not? But much is missing, I personally don't agree with her interpretations of Michael expecially in Chapter titled \\"Bizarre Behaviour\\"  first of all..VERY POOR choice of words for a title and to me perfectly indicative of the disconnect I feel with this book. Why do you think Michael wrote songs like They Don't Really Care About US? Scream? Tabloid Junky (who owns the tabloids), History and on and on...Sorry to those that disagree but this is my honest and humble opinion.This is like a Sophmoric attempt to compile his life. It has it's moments but the \\"misses\\" are so disturbing to me that I can't stay silent any longer. There are many messed up statements listed like facts that the other \\"2 stars\\" have mentiioned...It's just got something \\"off\\" about it and I am sad to say that..but I feel compelled to write this review in this light. Michael fought too hard to be treated lightly and I feel misinterpretedas a \\"tragic figure\\". Michael lived his soulful life with dignity and fought this unimaginable battle of good...against evil. It was why he came to us...to teach us to know, to wake up  and to live a enlightend life and save the Earth and her Children.
B00881VLCE|5.0|it is fun to play, lots of puzzles and variety. I would recommend this game to puzzle lover's of any age
B0086700CM|4.0|i like temple run!!! it gets boring after you get all the power ups but other than that, it's fun to try to collect coins.
0345803485|5.0|It was a fun read and juicy. My co-workers and I have read all three of the books and we enjoyed them all. The story does evolve from one book to the next. I would read it again. People say it isn't written well but I have never known of a book that has everyone talking about it and reading it like this book. Soooo maybe it isn't Intellectually stimulating but are we really reading it for that reason anyways? Ahhhh no ....lol
B004FPZ2G8|5.0|Having owned a copy of [[ASIN:1840220554 The Complete Novels of Jane Austen]] for years, I am disappointed in myself, in that I did not get around to reading Persuasion until I downloaded the Kindle version to my phone. This is now one of my favourite novels, and I can't wait until the time comes around again for me to re-read it.
0425221806|5.0|I am not a dog person but this was a great story about the bond between humans and dogs.  Kept me up at night reading...awesome book.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Great game to work on focus and concentration. Story line works well. The only thing I think it needs is an easy way to save your progress.
0439023548|5.0|Great book and it took a little long for me to get it but there was a storm so it wasn't to bad.
B00785P2QC|3.0|relaxing and engaging.  also a bit addicting.  your city grows even when you are not playing. i feel like i can have fun without spending money.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|as much as i love this book i was very upset to see that it was currently unavalible and i hae the actual hard cover but its such a pain to carry it around so i was hoping to find it on here<br />other then that stephen king has a amazing imagination nd i love this book one of my favorates i would recomend reading th book first befor watching the movie so you have a better understading of the story
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Do not be fooled,  you don't get 101 games. You have to work up to that. All in all it is good, some games are bad, most are enjoyable.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I love cut the rope but some levels are hard so it's a waste of time.I would still buy it though.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I think this series is great and I love it. Can't wait to buy season 3 when it comes out
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it. I like it a lot. a great selection of games. never gets boring. wish I could get more coins without having to download stupid apps.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|This is a good movie, not as good as the first one, but aren't all sequels like that? Lots of good special effects though, and a pretty good story line.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books kept me on the edge of my seat not only with the mystery as it unraveled but the awesome detail into many of the erotic mind blowing scenarios.  Would definitely recommend for any women that likes to fantasize about different situations.  I was also doing research on the computer in order to determine what many things stated in the book meant.
0439023513|5.0|Final book in trilogy series was as good as the first two- ending was a surprise. Looking forward to checking out more works by this author- just loved her style.
B001F12J3Y|2.0|This blu ray looks amazing in 2d.  The problem is with the 3d version.  Terrible ghosting throughout the whole movie.  It makes it challenging to sit through more than 15 minutes.  If you are buying this for the 3d, DON'T!  The regular version is cheaper and has better special features.  The 3d is a waste of money and aspirin.
B005ZUR724|4.0|its a really well but together game considering the platform that it was disgned to run on. A lot like WoW but in a good way....
B004LROMWU|5.0|This series is great for the sci-fi lovers amongst us, I wish it started with the actual invasion, it's kind of like starting a book at chapter three, but still very good!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't stop reading till I was done. There were lots of surprises in this book also. I couldn't stop reading this book till I was done.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Entertaining chess app, works great and is free.<br />Been using it for several weeks now and have not encountered any problems.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game. Graphics are awesome. Helps pass the time. I totally recommend this game for adults and children. Awesome '
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is an excellant book.  I enjoyed each page...well written and such a fantastic story!!  Thanks for telling it to all of us!
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|Interesting movie, it's about time somebody brought up the other side of wolves, they don't all stand silhouetted in front of the moon looking pretty, they are predators pure and simple. Pretty deep movie, not for those who want a happy ever after ending.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story was great. I couldn't stop reading this book.<br />There was a lot of surprises I didn't expect. I loved the whole trilogy
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think my subject line says it all. Fun to play and the different choices of games is nice. Glad I downloaded this for my Kindle.
1439170916|5.0|I bought this book in audiobook form about a year ago and listened to the first 8 chapters, which I enjoyed, but had to switch to another book for a project at work. A week ago, I was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in the throat - a smoker's cancer and I don't smoke. Of course, I returned to this book because now the subject is personal.<br /><br />I love the way the author combines history and research, the social, political, economic and even psychological impact into a narrative - it's great story telling. This may seem odd for a cancer book, but that's precisely why I love this book. This is not a clinical, medical book even though its written by a doctor, an oncologist - cancer doctor - at that. He has a wonderfully witty and literary style that is fun. \\"Patients has lost their patience,\\" he noted in one chapter last night.<br /><br />It seems amazing that a doctor treating cancer would have time to do all the research for this book, including going to meet one of the only living survivors of an early treatment regime. He weaves personal stories in with the discussion of how human understanding of the diseases developed. While being entertained, my understanding both of the disease and of the global effort to combat it has climbed astronomically.<br /><br />I'm indebted to Dr. Mukherjee for enlightenment and the reassurance that cancer treatment, unlike Virginia Slims, has come a long way, baby!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The best for me. Large numbers. Great for us seniors.  Just very easy to use. My hubby likes to use it to balance the checkbook.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|Charming, compelling story-telling. I really enjoyed this animation, even shed a few tears. I've heard this film was good and thought about watching it. However, I've always been put off by the animation style (it didn't look cute or well-drawn).<br /><br />It turned out to be a very sweet, interesting story that was well-done.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm loving this game! Takes up time, seriously addicting, makes you think, and it's fun. Get it now now now
B0082JYAZ2|4.0|Regina Spektor is in my top five favorite artists, and this album overall makes a consistent, solid addition to her previous work.<br /><br />I really enjoyed a couple of the songs: 'Oh Marcello', with its appropriation of \\"I'm just a soul whose intentions are good / oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood\\" and low-key beatboxing; the beautiful melody and catchy tune in 'Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas)'; and the driving beat in 'All the Rowboats'.<br /><br />'All the Rowboats' is as close as this album comes to a stand-out favorite for me. There's nothing to approach 'Us' from [[ASIN:B0047XNRHE Soviet Kitsch (Deluxe Version) [+Video]]], 'Dance Anthem of the 80's' from [[ASIN:B002COTI64 Far]], or 'Apres Moi' from [[ASIN:B0011Z50RQ Begin To Hope (U.S. Version)]]. I found that fact a bit disappointing, but perhaps the album will grow on me.<br /><br />Why four stars, then? Because, it's Regina Spektor and she's awesome!<br /><br />If you haven't listened to any of her other stuff I'd recommend starting with [[ASIN:B0011Z50RQ Begin To Hope (U.S. Version)]]. If you have, then 'What I saw from the Cheap Seats' is a perfectly serviceable addition to her corpus.<br /><br />Thank you Ms. Spektor for continuing to produce beautiful music!
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie.  Visually stunning ... yes.  But my husband and I walked out of the movie theatre scratching our heads and wondering why we'd just plunked down our hard earned money to watch a film that was, in many ways, worse than watching a re-run of a B-grade horror film on late-night sci-fi channel.  Any one of the over-arching themes thrown into this kitchen sink of a movie might have carried it.  A woman's quest for answers about her mother's death.  Corporate greed.  Father-daughter rivalry.  Love.  Infertility.  The origins of species.  Immortality.  Or even the theme 'your creators are disappointed in you.'  Instead, they were all thrown into the mix in a mish-mash that made absolutely no sense.<br /><br />The verdict ... skip this movie completely.  Even when it gets released on video.
B005KR6NS6|5.0|The movie was in the theatres in 1997, came out on DVD in 2007. Three languages are spoken during the movie. There are no subtitles.
B005FITILO|4.0|Due to the fact that there was a limited screening of \\"Young Adult\\" in the theaters, I wasn't able to watch this movie locally.  So, like most people, I had to wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray/DVD.  Charlize Theron plays an ghostwriter of a once-popular teenage book series who attempts to rekindle an old flame from high school.  I don't want to spoil the plot for those of you who are planning to purchase this movie so I won't go much further, but rest assured that Charlize Theron absolutely nails her role and her performance is reason enough to purchase this movie (I being a big fan of her's).  I enjoyed watching her performance in this movie and that alone is reason enough to buy and watch this movie.  I'm sure the Academy will be calling her once again.
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|A movie about superhero named Sherlock, who has the power to slow down time and be able to react to events faster than anyone else, thus making him appear to have superhuman capabilities. Sort of like the characters in The Matrix.<br /><br />The storyline flows well and is of a decent enough pace to keep the viewers interest throughout. Trouble is, I wasn't sure when the comedy was intentional and when it was due to unbelievable script writing.<br /><br />For example; a scrap of thick paper with a wine stain on it would lead many to deduce that the note on it was written hastily in a restaurant on whatever material the author had to hand. To Sherlock it means, that there is a printing shop nearby which contains a wine cellar. And yes, so there is. The powers of deduction and heroic deeds could have been written by the Monty Python crew at times.<br /><br />The characters are quiet shallow, and at no time did I feel like I had any sympathy for their situation nor did I concern myself that there was ever any danger of anyone important being seriously harmed anyway.<br /><br />Stephen Fry as Mycroft adds to the Monty Python feel to the movie, only trouble is MP did it better some 40 years ago.<br /><br />As I said, an enjoyable romp with a sufficiently storyline that it holds one's interest for the majority of the film. But if you want new Sherlock Holmes, get the series 'Sherlock' from the BBC. A more original and almost believable take on the SH stories and with characters that have personalities which one can care about.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|Good fast pace app. Keeps your finger's super busy. Contol Gravity Guy through an fast pace obstical course,just try not to blink.
B004CFA93M|5.0|I just want to start off by saying that this is my third favorite book of Jane's. (Emma first, then Pride and Predjudice.) But Sense and Sensibility is very good on its own if not compared to those two:)<br />  Well to begin with Marianne is not as bad as some of the other reviewers have made her out to be. They should take into mind that she spends more than half of the book with her heart most cruelly broken by a man that I fell for just as hard as she did. (Willoughby.... Willoughby!)<br />  On a happier note though, there is one man whom I can still love at the end of the book, Edward Ferrars. He is not the wildly romantic man that Willoughby was, but what he lacks in that area he makes up for in others, such as his strength of charachter, his sweetness, and, as another reviewer mentioned, his loyalty. Yes, he is so loyal he almost left my heart broken twice. Luckily, Lucy did one thing right and saved us all from having to see that unhappy arrangement:(<br />  Well I really think I've said enough to give you the picture that this story is filled with drama and romance.(For all you that like that sort of thing, I know I do!) Also the romance in this book is completely clean! I definetely appreciate that, and if Jane Austen were here I would thank her for making all of her novels clean, so that girls like me who don't read books filled with trash can enjoy a good love story every once in a while!!  :)
0345803493|1.0|Really tried giving this book a chance but not much to it.  Boring. Read immature. Submissive/dominant sexual exotica. Weak storyline. Waste of $10.00
B00884GR0W|1.0|this is a minecraft rip off do not get this save your money I wish I could return this DO NOT GET THIS!!!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I have always been jealous of my friends that have Temple Run on their iphones and I couldn't get Temple Run with my android phone. Once I got my Kindle Fire and downloaded it, I could see why they were hooked, it's tons of fun and super addicting. Great game!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|can't stop playing! love all the challenges. they get progressively harder. my daughter showed me this game and now this is in top 5 favorotes!
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I think people would enjoy this game. it takes a lot of time to get to all kinds of waves but it should be a great game to play. I love it
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love this adaptation.  Ruth Wilson is a great choice for Jane, and Toby Stephens is a very dark and sexy Rochester.  Perfect!  There are a few changes from the book here and there that will probably annoy the hardcore Jane Eyre fans, but for the rest of us it's pretty great.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|just doesn't show up a picture of it on my apps it is blank. other than that it is great.
B001B93H0O|5.0|zumba is so much fun, A great cardio work out.<br />I recomend it for all those couch potatoes like me.<br />So easy and fun, makes you feel so envigorized.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is amazingly addicting. it is a great game when you are bored too it is a great game and recommended
B007N85ZXY|5.0|This the first CD I have purchased in the last 20 years that I have wanted to hear night after night after night... Love the song selection, the twisting of the arrangements, Neil's voice and especially the loosey-goosey but reliable sound of Crazy Horse... These guys had one hell of a ball making this CD and it shows... Best Neil Young since the days of \\"Down By the River\\" and \\"Cinnamon Girl\\"...
B0086700CM|3.0|it is realy fun if u can get past all of its bugs and glitches and get it to not crash your device it is not a game for the kindle fire
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|very cool free app... buttons are big n easy to read... saves last calculation too... cant beat it for a free app
0345803485|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said hundreds of times already? I read the book and made up my own mind, it does what it sets out to do. I really enjoyed it.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|This game is too big for my screen slow and boring. This is a waste of time and down load.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books are so well written that I could see their faces in my mind when i was reading.the sex was great but the story line was as important, the books kept you wondering what was going to happen next, couldnt put them down, hope there are more to come in this series, best books I've read in a long time.I hope that when they cast the movie they are very careful about picking out the actors,and stay true to the book,well done.......
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|In this second installment, Sherlock Holmes employs a myriad of disguises which even manage to fool Watson on occasion. Watson gets married and Holmes is his best man of course, however, Holmes is a bit of a pest for the new wife. The honeymoon will have to wait. The action and intrigue center around a dangerously clever professor who strives to own all the bullets and bandages in the world. He and Sherlock Holmes play a high stakes game of chess. A winning strategy requires intelligent and unorthodox planning. The conflict and the devices of the villain relate to modern day.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great and fun game keeps your attention with hours of play.  must have game for all ages.  just pure fun.
0765316994|3.0|Interesting story. \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" meets \\"Galaxy Quest\\" but the \\"he said\\" after every sentence, as other reviewers have mentioned, is so grating. This was the first Scalzi book I've read and am reticent to read any others. Very surprised that such a prolific writer wouldn't mix it up with a \\"he grunted\\" or \\"she sneered.\\" Or better yet, trust we can distinguish who is saying what when it's a two person conversation.<br /><br />And while it's cute to have Wheaton as the narrator, he basically just reads the book to you. I've listened to hundreds of audiobooks and this is the first where there is no performance, no difference between the character's voices be they male or female, old or young. But I guess that's the difference between an actor and a voice actor.<br /><br />While the fantasy story took a somewhat disappointing turn into reality, I did enjoy the ending. I just wish the road to get there hadn't been so nails-on-a-chalkboard annoying with the he said, he said, he said. But maybe listeners could make it a drinking game. They'd have alcohol poisoning after the first two pages, but hey, you'd forget about the lazy writing.
0345803485|1.0|Awful writing + glorification of an abusive relationship = trash.  Fifty Shades is a spicier version of a good old Harlequin Romance, with all the tropes of the genre: sweet young woman falls for gorgeous, super-rich, arrogant man with a tragic past, boo hoo.  She tames him and turns him into a better person.  When Fifty Shades got to the backstory that explained why Christian was so messed up - his birth mother was a crack whore - I laughed out loud. Of course she was a crack whore!<br /><br />I loved the reviewer who hypothesized that the book had been dreamt up by a couple of teenage girls.  But what disturbs me about this book is that such a piece of garbage is being read and analyzed by some pretty smart women as if Christian Grey were a literary construct worthy of discussion.  I CAN'T STAND IT.  He - and this book - have less depth than a comic book.  (Jughead's character flaws would be more interesting.)<br /><br />Most disturbing - the abuse factor.  Who cares what people do in the bedroom - it's no one's business.  But his controlling her life, limiting her contact with friends and family, are the hallmarks of batterers.  And her acquiescence in that kind of relationship - which is meant to be \\"hot\\" - is typical of abused women.  I wonder how real woman who have suffered mistreatment at the hands of a partner find this book. Not so sexy, I'm guessing.<br /><br />And here's my least favorite passage: \\"It's (controlling and hitting) right for Christian. It's what he wants, and ...after all he's done (bought her a car and first class airfare) I have to man up and take whatever he decides he wants, whatever he thinks he needs.\\"<br /><br />Whoa! We should put up with men controlling and hitting us as long as they buy us expensive gifts???  What the hell year is this?  Gloria Steinem, speak up about this piece of crap book.  Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />On every dimension - artistic, political, psychological - this book is offensive, misogynistic junk, and I wish people would recognize that and shut up about it already!nistic junk, and I wish people would recognize that and shut up about it already!
B0072GPQNG|3.0|This movie depicts an excessive amount of cruelty to horses, more than I think was necessary to get the point across. It was tough for me to watch. I didn't enjoy it and I usually do like Spielberg's films. I'll give 3 stars for the parts of the movie sans cruelty.<br /><br />The horse works the farm until he is drafted into military service during the war. During his journey away from home, the horse meets other horses and a variety of people. His bonding experiences with them is actually quite touching. His owner never gives up trying to get him back.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I ordered this product after my original Kindle charging cord became naught but a pretty mesh of silver wires. Unlike many other reviewers, I first contacted Amazon to inquire whether they would replace an obviously defective part several years out of warranty and, lo! a $10.00 credit on my account, exactly the amount needed to purchase this item. I received my minimally-packaged order the very next day, despite having not paid for such expedited service, and the new cord works nicely to charge my Kindle from either the wall plug or a computer, just as I had hoped. So if you're thinking about buying this to replace the pile of plastic chips your original cord has become, try chatting with tech support or calling the help line first! And, if you're one of the people posting grumpy reviews about having to buy something you thought you'd already purchased -- well, maybe you should try the help line too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is easy to read and get sucked into the story line. Read first book in 2 days -would have been only 1 but had to go to work! Loved all three highly recommend
B007SGM084|5.0|Very good product. Highly recommended! Once you started reading you will never stop. One of the best books I ever purchased. Excellently written!
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I've always held the opinion that as an actor Tom Cruise gives a solid performance. His latest Mission: Impossible is no exception. The action is here along with some nifty gadgetry. The scene in the multi-level parking garage is pretty cool too. Expect the unexpected twists and turns that accompany the MI agents and don't forget to buckle your seatbelt.
B005D63RQK|5.0|Lol and to think Walt thought a fly was a contaminant.  I love this show!!!  It just keeps getting better and better, yo!!!!
B007ZH9P0C|5.0|After Madonna failed to give us a full remix package on CD for the first single from MDNA, I had low hopes for ANY remix packages. But here, we are treated to an actual OLD SKOOL maxi single with more than half a dozen full length club mixes. Plenty of banging electro club mixes to please everyone. Get it before it disappears forever. Track times:<br /><br />1  Girl Gone Wild (Avicii's UMF Mix) 5:16<br />2  Girl Gone Wild (Dave Aud&eacute; Remix) 8:05<br />3  Girl Gone Wild (Justin Cognito Remix) 4:48<br />4  Girl Gone Wild (Kim Fai Remix) 6:34<br />5  Girl Gone Wild (Lucky Date Remix) 5:06<br />6  Girl Gone Wild (Offer Nissim Remix) 6:49<br />7  Girl Gone Wild (Dada Life Remix)  5:16<br />8  Girl Gone Wild (Rebirth Remix)  6:50
B007I2BZIE|2.0|Rush is definitely in my top 3 favorite bands. Sadly though, this album just does not do it for me.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Dreams within dreams is what Inception is about. What if you could trespass into another person's dreams for your own purposes? It's a far out idea but Inception does a good job of playing out that scenario. This movie is fast paced Sci-Fi that makes you think of The Matrix.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|No need for another lengthy review.<br /><br />This is a brilliant, epic, moving work of art.  As with all Rush albums, it took about 6 listenings from start to finish with the earbuds in for me to start get my arms around the entire album, but now I can't get enough of it.  This is the most emotionally powerful work they've ever done.  I feels to me like the culmination of their almost 40 years of perfecting their craft of musicianship and songwriting, as well as lifetimes of raising families, losing loved ones, etc. There's no indication this will be their last album, and I certainly hope it's not, but they've created one heck of a tough act to follow for themselves.
