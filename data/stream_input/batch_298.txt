B0000041Q3|5.0|Joan Sutherland is a great Turandot. Pavorotti is a great Calaf. Caballe is a great Liu. This is the best Turandot out there. <BR>To get an accurate judgement of this legendary set, read all the reviews - not just one by someone who obviously is very immature.
B000002KNY|5.0|You can listen to this album a million times and not get tired of it. This is a masterpiece that far outshines the often favored '77. Byrne's frantic vocals coupled with the unconvential african/punk/techno/rock rhythms makes this album a frenetic movement of genius.<BR>I Zimbra is a sort of disco rhythmed/african tribal chant that reminds us we are dealing with pioneering and unorthodix rock n' roll. While Mind is a slinky like song that relies on Byrne's plaintive lyrics and a descending and reverberating bass beat to draw you in and keeps you singing it for hours after.<BR>\\"Had a love affair and it was only paper!\\" Byrne screams. This brilliant and quick confession is then countered by a low tone chant of \\"sunrays they pass right through\\".<BR>I always start off with intention to go through each song, but it seems ridiculous. Buy this album, it is incredible!
B00005JLRT|5.0|This was one of the best Star Trek movies ever, It has alot of great action sequences and a really good story line. This is one to add to your movie collection.
B00007AJGH|5.0|like the film itself, the vista series of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is designed for the enjoyment of both children and adults alike. i was 11 years old when this movie was first released, and i remember being completely blown away by it. this movie only could have come from the 1980s! the special effects would not have been possible previously, and there's no way disney would allow all the cursing and violence if it were being made today. when i watched this dvd, i had not seen ROGER RABBIT since i was a kid. as an adult and avid movie fan, i was still completely blown away! this movie is not only a technical achievement (no computers were used, all animation was hand drawn) but it succeeds on levels of creativity and entertainment as well. it really is a great flick.<br />disc 1 is for the kiddies, it contains the full-frame version of the movie and a couple extras that briefly go over how the movie was made and so forth.<br />disc 2 is for longtime fans and film buffs (the people dvds were made for in the first place). it contains the widescreen version of the film, plus tons and tons of supplemental material on the making of the movie. through interviews, rough cuts, on-set footage and more, you get to see every stage of production and all the info you could ever want on what went into making such a visionary film. this disc is loaded and will not disappoint.<br />WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is a classic because they just don't make movies like this anymore. this isn't a children's movie, it's a movie period. it doesn't insult the intelligence of its viewers and wasn't made to cash in. it has withstood the test of time, because i loved it as a kid and now with this special edition, i can enjoy it on a whole new level as an adult. my kids can watch the first disc and be completely entertained as i was, then as they get older they can dip into disc 2 and who knows? maybe they'll be inspired to get out there and bring their imagination to life the way these filmmakers did..
0375414053|5.0|If I could have given this book even MORE stars, I certainly would have....this book is, without a doubt, my life(with one less kid). <br />Kate Reddy is superwoman, who tries to do it all--wife, mother, careerwoman.....and manages to do OK--with a little cheating (\\"distressing\\" a mince pie to give it that homemade appearance,) and a few minor setbacks (taking her daughter's urine sample on a business trip rather than her organizer). With the help of her imperfect architect husband, Kate manages to stay afloat for a while---until she realizes that she cannot be all things to all people, and has to make a choice...and what a choice it is!<br />This book is pure fun...readers will laugh aloud as they wonder if the author has been peering through the windows of their own lives. I recommend this book to working and nonworking mothers, working and nonworking fathers, and just folks everywhere. You'll have a renewed appreciation for the most important role of all--motherhood.
B000002KB8|5.0|Even though this might not be Sabbath's &quot;best&quot; album, by being the first and introducing the world to a whole new realm of sound and imagery, it remains a must-own classic for anyone that has even the slightest interest in Rock/Heavy Metal. Every sub-genre of Metal has its roots right here. From Goth's melancholy, to Doom Metal's slow pace and eerie atmospheres, to flat out Thrash/Speed Metal - the seeds are on Black Sabbath. The Hippies are dancing around singing about peace and free love, and there goes Sabbath with ther ominous darkness to crush them all. Like them or not, they are true innovators. I once read something about Tony Iommy literally going to amp manufacturers in the mid to late 60's, and telling them about the sound he heard in his head, so that they could modify the amps to get it, BECAUSE THAT SOUND DID NOT EXIST YET! Imagine that! I got goosebumps reading that. That is a true visionary.  I will only say one more thing: This album is the defining moment of a band that changed music forever. Hail the Masters of Metal!
B000002NZO|4.0|This is a very underrated Genesis album. It contains such a wide variety of musical styles and it is a true indication of the greatness yet to come.<br />Trespass contains some classics that most Genesis fans would recognize such as &quot;Looking for Someone&quot; and &quot;The Knife&quot;, both featuring terrific vocals from Peter Gabriel. But I think the real charm of Trespass are the lesser known tracks. In particular, &quot;Stagnation&quot; and &quot;Dusk&quot; are two of the finest things that Genesis has ever done. The vocals, keyboards, guitar and flute are terrific on these tracks.<br />This was recorded before Phil Collins and Steve Hackett joined the band so it has a slightly different feel than the better known follow up efforts (&quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and &quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot;).<br />Give it a couple of listens and I promise it will grow on you.
B000002UVZ|5.0|&quot;I believe in coyotes and time as an abstract/<br />Explain the change, the difference between/<br />What you want and what you need, there's the key&quot;<br />-- &quot;I Believe&quot;<br />A review, however written, however praised, I fear won't do this one justice.  It's that good...the pinnacle of what R.E.M. has to offer, which is saying a lot in and of itself.  To offer unabashed praise without reason is as empty as the soul of a record company corporate lawyer, so here goes.<br />After all these years of following R.E.M., I've just now noticed the cover art for &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot; is none other than a close-up of Bill Berry upper mug.  Who could mistake those bushy unibrows?  And now he farms and has left R.E.M. a drum-machining threesome, but this is all beside the point...reason...where's the reason?<br />&quot;Lifes Rich Pageant,&quot; opens up smoking and we hear Michael Stipe's voice clearly, lucid, growling, &quot;Let's begin again, like Martin Luther's Zen.&quot;  And so they have, once again recreating themselves in discovery which has kept their marathon career fresh, interesting, and relevant.<br />&quot;Fall on Me,&quot; and &quot;The Flowers of Guatemala,&quot; represent the genius of Stipe and Mills songwriting and are hauntingly beautiful.  &quot;Fall on Me,&quot; pays homage to the sky, gives religion back to the sky, fears the falling of the sky with the interplay of rounds between Stipe and Mills, &quot;Don't fall on me (What is it up in the air for) (It's gonna fall)/Fall on me (If it's there for long) (It's gonna fall)/Fall on me (It's over it's over me) (It's gonna fall)&quot;<br />Ther's silliness as well, but artistic silliness in a curious, &quot;Underneath the Bunker,&quot; screams and yelps in &quot;Just a Touch,&quot; and  archaic arcane lyrical language of, &quot;Swan Swan H.&quot;  What does it all mean?  R.E.M. is just beginning to flesh out their politics here and pays homage to a lost childhood with &quot;Cuyahoga,&quot; the same Ohio river that caught on fire due to it being so heavily polluted and toxic in 1969.<br /><br />This album really has so many layers like the peels of an onion, the music, the lyrics, the accompanying vocals layered and subtle, that you will find yourself years later still discovering things with closer listens.  Though R.E.M. has put out some briliant music over the years particularly in &quot;New Adventures in Hi Fi,&quot; and &quot;Automatic For the People,&quot; none reach the watermark set by 1986's &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant.&quot;  It raves, it rocks, it reels, it rolls.  It's a reckoning of a different order, a revolution, musical and deep...a must.

B000007T1M|5.0|Whoever classified this album as rap-metal is an insane crackhead.  This album is pure metal and i love it! This is System at their best.  I've had this CD since it came out and i never get tired of listening to it.  This is one of those CDs that people talk about putting it in the CD player, hit play, and listen to the whole thing.  The guitar riffs are insanely heavy and Serj Tankian's melodic vocals are the perfect compliment to the pounding drums and guitars.  If you like it loud and heavy this is the album to have.  SOAD doesn't really compare to other bands which is why I like them.  The closest i can think of is maybe Slipknot or Pantera but with more melodic tunes. Trust me- i am a metallite who knows good music.  This CD is a must for any metal fan.  Check out some other less-known metal bands- Cold, Union Underground, Systematic, Stereomud, Superjoint Ritual, Strapping Young Lad.
B00004W52U|5.0|Every Ska band in existence pretty much wants to be like Operation Ivy. This is the only record in the genre worth buying. Classic. <br />The guitartist went on to form Rancid and more recently The Transplants.
1400034779|3.0|Interesting book with nice written style by the author. The language and style ring true and the Stories are interesting snapshots of life in africa but I really couldnt figure out what the big noise is all about? maybe I need to go to the today website (this was their selection for book of the month) and see what other people thought. I think V.S Naipal or Chinua Achebe are better options if you want to learn a little about africa. This is a sweet gentle book and i agree with other reviewers about it but this is no earthshaking examination of africa.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown knows the secret to contructing a real page turner, and I hold him responsible for a lack of sleep, and a number of questions I now hope to answer by investigating the topic he was so apt to put forth in this masterpiece of suspense, and conspiracy theory. Catholics need not apply, but anyone else in search of excitement should definitely buy in. ...
B00006F83Y|2.0|don't believe the hype. this made-for-MTV, hopelessly outdated, bland and unoriginal band personifies everything that is wrong with music in general. hey, im no expert, but why waste your time with boring and inane patter when there are thousands of great albums just waiting to be heard?
B00000HYXB|5.0|This is the best metall album I have heard in my entire life. I grew up with Metalica, Iron Maiden and other metall bands, but Nightfall in Middle Earth compleatly blew me away. with its exelent epic powermetall (and elven quior) it retells Tolkiens saga of the Silmarills from the day thar the dark lord Melkor Stole them from Feanor to the last atempt of the free people to regain them. The peaks of the album is Nightfall, The curse of Feanor, Mirror Mirror, and Time stands Still (at the Iron Hill), when Sorrow sang and A passage in darknes. <br />Buy it, listen to it, and your world wil newer be the same.<br />All hail Blind Guardian!
6303965415|5.0|Really likes this adaptation of persuasion. The actors conveyed the sentiments of Anne &amp; Captain Wentworth very well.
B000001A6F|5.0|I first heard this album when I was 18 years old and had just moved in with my sister who is 14 years my senior.  What a great move!  I began to learn what real music is.  Music that comes from the heart and gives you a glimpse of a person's soul.  Super Woman is probably my favorite becuase of the powerful vocals on the second half, but Happier than the Morning Sun moves me to tears every time I hear it.  I love this album and would recommend it to anyone who listens music to feel joy, love, happiness and even sadness in some parts.  Good buy!
B00005JLSC|4.0|Having never seen the musical \\"Chicago\\", I entered the movie theater with no preconceived notions or expectations and was impressed with \\"Chicago\\" the film.  I've heard it called the best movie of the year, and I don't agree, but I was greatly entertained; I found myself singing \\"All That Jazz\\" throughout the car ride home at the top of my lungs.  Transitioning a theatrical piece from the stage to the screen can result in quite a mess, and I was impressed with director Rob Marshall's vision: the musical numbers as fantasy sequences worked much better than I would have thought.  I enjoyed watching non-singers and -dancers plow through the material, and thought all involved pulled it off quite well, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones who really tore into the role of Velma Kelly.  She had just the right tone as a seductive murderess obsessed with fame; Renee Zellweger's Roxie Hart seemed a little soft and sweet to be believable as a cold-hearted fame-seeker, but she showed great flair in her singing and dancing.  Even Richard Gere, God bless him, pulled off a few numbers (and camped it up quite amusingly as sleek lawyer Billy Flynn).  As for Queen Latifah, keep putting her in films; she has an enjoyable screen presence, and I loved her in this.  All in all, I wouldn't call this the best film of the year, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I'd watch it again.
0060934913|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is a bit of a foul-mouthed, pushy, opinionated New Yorker. He also happens to write truthful and often times funny (albeit frightening) prose.<br />Recently Bourdain has obtained a puny level of fame, ala his television series.  Bourdain is no newcomer to writing. He has several books under his belt, with Kitchen Confidential being his \\"break through\\" book.<br />What I like most about Bourdain's writing is that his sharp wit and personality clearly comes through . He might come off like a jerk sometimes, but this is not a man who presumes or pretends otherwise.<br />His writing is honest and funny. He explores his fateful rise through some of New York's most, (hmmmm, how shall I put this?) most interesting resturants. He discusses with humor and frankness the little-known heirarchy of a kitchen staff. He takes you through how retaurants order food, what items to avoid and why eating bread is generally safe.<br />Bourdain's writing style is not for the timid. He's fond of foul language and uses it frequently. But his stories are brilliant and insightful, not only into the underbelly of the restuarant business but into why he became a chef in the first place. Bourdain is your lovable, drunk, slightly perverted Uncle.<br />A quick and entertaining read.
B00006LPER|5.0|&quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; is one of the most affecting films I've seen in a long time.  It is spare and cruel, and really has no resolution which often drives moviegoers crazy; I thought it was masterful.  I saw it over a week ago and I'm still thinking about it, which speaks to how powerful it is.  I won't go into plot details - you should see it yourself!  But I found none of its explicitness gratuitous in the least.  I thought it was a very honest portrait of the pain and anger of an individual.  I wouldn't really say it was about sadomasochism, because I think it's much deeper than that.  It's exposing, in a painfully raw way, the torment of a particular person.  I imagine this film will resound with two kinds of people - cinephiles focused on the artistry of the film and those who identify, on a personal level, with pain.  For those, Isabelle Huppert expresses more truth in the movement of an eyebrow than in just about anything else I've seen.  If you know what you're getting into, &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; can be an amazing experience.
B000069CWE|3.0|I am an avid Linkin Park fan.When I first heard One Step Closer on my brother's computer, I knew this band was going to be big. Hybrid Theory was one of those albums that you honestly enjoyed every single track. When LP came out with Reanimation, I bought it first day because I liked Pts.of.Athrty and 1stp Klosr from downloads. When I got home and put it in the cd player, I'm sorry to say I was a little disappointed. I myself am not a fan of rap/hip-hop, and that is what this CD is mostly made up of. I do like the way they altered the lyrics on some songs though. I think Enth E Nd would make an awesome song if it was put back on the original music. P5hng Me A*wy featured a great verse by guest vocalist Stephen Richards of Taproot that got stuck in my head the moment I heard it(\\"Reverse psychology is failing miserably....\\"). H! Vltg3 was the biggest disappointment in my mind. The original version that appeared on Hybrid Theory EP wasn't all that great, but when heard the first remix of it that appeared on the One Step Closer single(along with the original My December), it immediately became one of my favourite Linkin Park songs, and I was hoping that it would make an appearance on this cd, but instead they remixed it again and did a bad job of it too, I almost always skip over it. My favourite song on the cd has to be Wth>You, because it is the closest thing on the cd to what Linkin Park truely is, and I really like the opening of the song. Jonathan Davis and Aaron Lewis' appearances are also briliant for the CD, and the way they linked the beginning, middle and end tracks was pretty slick, it is almost like listening to one continuous song.<br />If you are already a Linkin Park fan, then I suggest you add this album to your collection, if not and are curious about LP, then don't this album, buy Hybrid Theory or Meteora to see what they are really like, unless of course you like rap/hip-hop.
B00006J9OT|4.0|While it only took me an instant to fall in love with her sultry, provocative voice from her earlier recordings, I sometimes felt that she was holding back to some extent on her piano playing.  Not so, here! <br />I still have not had the pleasure of seeing her perform live, but this recording makes it abundantly clear that, outside the studio, she can really let loose.  She displays a remarkable sense of emotion, energy and style in her playing that lives up to her vocal prowess in this live set. <br />Not to be missed by fans and the uninitiated alike.
B000002G6J|5.0|Like a tensed bicep covered in velvet, Antonio Carlos Jobim's music is soft and smooth on the outside, but laced with strength and muscularity just below the surface.  To put it another way (and without resorting to such purple prose), it will relax you but not bore you.  In fact, as strange as it may seem, it will relax you and invigorate you at the same time.  &quot;Wave&quot; is a great introduction to this great artist's music.  Listening to it in the car recently on the way to work, the various selections pleasantly insulated me from the petty annoyances of rush hour traffic, but woke me up and made me more alert at the same time.  It was really quite amazing.
6304342160|5.0|This is what I'm talking about. A film that has smart characters, so smart that you aren't sure that even YOU know what they will and wil not do, along with an acceptance of sexuality that it secondary to the plot. This movie could've been played by a man and a woman, two men, whatever, the point is that when opportunity knocks teh important thing is to be in tune enough with yourself to fling yourself into it.<br />Jennifer Tilly is somewhere between hilarious and chilling as a woman who may or may not be a ditz, a bimbo, a conniver, a liar, a fool, depending upon how SHE decides and Gina Gershon plays a lesbian who thinks she's closed off to the seduction game, only to be seduced.<br />In the end I was even sure whether Gershon represented love to Tilly's character or simply the best opportunity.<br />A priceless gem of a movie.
0441003257|5.0|I have just recently entered into Neil Gaiman's Sandman works, and have truly loved the experience of the graphic novel, although it is still newto me.  I have also just read the first of Terry Pratchett's Disc World, The Color of Magic, which I found a bit hard to follow in both the language and narrative, but enjoyed none the less.  But I truly believe these two authors hit a goldmine in working together.  Their ideas are beautifully executed in prose that is British, but not too British for the average American.  And it's damn funny, this stuff, too!  I laughed out loud in public places while reading this story about the impending doom of the planet.  Now I'm not so scared of the apocolypse!  I must say, if you are very religious, this could be a bit &quot;blasphemous&quot; but I find that sort of humor refreshing.  Let's not take all this life stuff too seriously.  If you need a good laugh at the expense of a Catholic-school-upbringing, enjoy this one!  (Also, for blasphemous humor in the same tone, watch Kevin Smith's film,Dogma.  In which, God is played by Alanis Morisette.)
B00005JL96|5.0|I never got to see it at theaters, until I purchased the DVD and it was well worth every cent I spent on it.<br />It starts following the tradition of the Heavy Metal movie: a space court filled with hundreds of strange beings judging an inventor for creating such a disastrous creature: Stitch. Stitch is condemned and ordered to be transferred to another planet but he escapes using his mighty powers and great intelligence. Until here, the movie is dark, Stitch is a really mean creature not showing any kind of good feelings towards anybody.<br />He finally lands in Hawaii where he meets Lilo and becomes her pet (after hiding a couple of his 6 arms to ressemble a dog, a blue one with antennas, but a dog anyway).<br />Here's where fun starts and never ends until the final credits roll up in the screen. Don't miss Stitch in his Elvis impersonation... Back in the space, the multi-eyed inventor is being tasked with the mission of capturing the evil creature and to bring it back home with the help of an idiot sidekick.<br />I don't recall laughing so much in a Disney movie for a long time ...<br />The DVD is filled with extras with an excellent image and audio. Go do yourself and your kids a favor and buy it.
B00000IN5G|5.0|This album has all the markings of a truly great album. This will probably be in the top ten list of metal albums to own ten years from now. ... I wouldn't be suprised if album wasn't ranked near the top of that list and over bands like Tallica and Sabbath just because these guys are completely and totally 100% talented and original in their crazy, riff heavy, keyboard pounding ways that no other band seems to be able to produce. I recommend this album to anyone who loves old styled thrash with lots of keyboards and heavy guitar work and would like to hear old styled thrash with a twist
6305014140|3.0|This is an awesome movie. All the characters are realistic in their emotions and you really feel for some of them (especially Kagome). The plot twist of Jubei gets poisoned (not a spoiler, happens ten minutes into it) is a cool countdown plot. Though the animation is outdated, it looked good when i so about 3 years ago. But, the dvd is TERRIBLE! Of course, I expect this from Manga now.The features are nice, but the quality of sound and picture is horrible. It's like a VHS copy. Overall, good movie, bad DVD.
B00003CX8J|4.0|With the second X-Men movie rolling out this summer, I decided that it would be a good time to get off my backside and watch the first. What I found was a very enjoyable action movie, with more brains than one usually finds in that genre, with a good cast and excellent direction. If the sequel is this good, then it will definitely be worth watching.<br />In recent years, an increasing number of people have been discovered to be mutants, whose DNA has taken a leap forward and given them superhuman powers. Now their freedom is threatened. Rogue, a girl whose touch can kill (Anna Paquin) and Logan/Wolverine, (Hugh Jackman) a man with steel claws and amazing regenerative abilities are attacked in Canada, only to be rescued by mutants and taken to a top-secret \\"school for the gifted\\" in New York. It's run by the mind-reading/controlling mutant Carles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), to teach and protect his fellow mutants, known as X-Men.<br />But there are others without such benevolent plans. Magneto (Ian McKellen), a Holocaust survivor who can generate powerful magnetic fields, anticipates a coming war between mutants and ordinary humans. With the help of the reptilian shapeshifter Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), savage Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), and nasty Toad (Ray Park), he abducts and artificially mutates a U.S. senator, then threatens the entire population of New York with a bizarre weapon. And only the X-Men can hope to stop him.<br />Yes, it sounds cheesy, but it's done well. In fact, most of the movie goes under the listing of sounds-stupid-but-is-done-well. The superpower-enhanced action sequences are well done, and the mutants are given human edges and attachments that keep them from just being pretty faces with superpowers. They may not be homo sapiens any longer, but in personality they are quite human. The special effects are surprisingly muted, and usually kept in tune with the storyline. Though this is an action movie, it bothers to have a complicated plotline including politics, history, and a bit of commentary on intolerance and mindless prejudice as well.<br />Patrick Stewart does a good job as a benevolent father-figure to all the mutants (they're even referred to as his \\"children\\" in one scene). Ian McKellen is flawless as Magneto; this is not some random wanna-conquer-the-world villain, but someone who is embittered and determined to the point of potential genocide. (An interesting parallel is that he is a survivor of the Holocaust, yet he seeks to establish a \\"master race\\" of mutants) Hugh Jackman does a good job with Wolverine's tough-guy image that covers his confusion and loneliness, since he doesn't know who he is or who put metal all over his bones. Anna Paquin annoyed me as Rogue, because she seems to cry a lot. Famke Janssen (as telekinetic Jean Grey), Halle Berry (as weather-controlling Storm), and James Marsden (as laser-eyed Cyclops) are all good supporting roles, although Berry's role is somewhat thinner than her costars'.<br />This movie is also a bit darker than films like Spiderman, more adult and more disturbing (especially with the themes about prejudice and discrimination). This movie isn't quite flawless, unfortunately. Some of the costumes are a bit overdone, especially Storm's -- is there any logical reason for her to wear that silver catsuit and cape? Most of the characters are fine, like Cyclops and Wolverine, but occasionally the costumes get a little silly. Additionally, many of the scientific aspects of the movie are never explained at all, such as Kelly's transformation into the human jellyfish. How exactly does Magneto do this? I'm a little fuzzy on how that radiation is generated and how it affects ordinary humans.<br />Despite these flaws, \\"X-Men\\" is a good solid action/SF movie, especially since it so easily could have been a total disaster. Pop popcorn and sit back.including politics, history, and a bit of commentary on intolerance and mindless prejudice as well. <br />Patrick Stewart does a good job as a benevolent father-figure to all the mutants (they're even referred to as his \\"children\\" in one scene).

B00005MAM2|5.0|This movie is the best movie you will EVER see in this lifetime (Ghost in the Shell comes close). It's the story of Tetsuo and Kaneda, best friends, and bikers. When Tetsuo gets hurt getting out of the way for a kid, he's subjected to experiments from the army to advance his psychic powers. The dub is good, and features voice talents like Johnny Young-Bosch (Power Rangers, Trigun) and Josh Seth (Digimon, Tokyo Pig, every Saban dub since '98). Pioneer went all out on restoring this. They did a feature on the restoration that shows you how much work went into this. Although the sub is 2.0 only, there's a new disc out in DTS (thank God I have 5.1) Overall, good transfer, good extrras, perfect movie.
B0000640VO|5.0|Don't read reviews of the French film \\"Amelie\\" in advance, because the impression you'll get before you see it is: This is \\"Emma\\" on acid. And it isn't -- it's a sweet, whimsical, weird, and touching little tale about a shy young woman with a big heart. She's nobody's little weasel... yet! But as the movie progresses, you'll rapidly want to see her become somebody's little weasel.<br />Amelie (Audrey Tatou) is a shy, introspective young woman with a vivid imagination and a quirky sense of humor. One day she accidently finds a little box of toys and photographs, and goes on a little quest to find the owner, decades later, and give him back his box. When the return of the box improves the man's life, Amelie is so pleased that she decides to keep helping others be happy in their own lives.<br />She gives a brittle-boned, reclusive old artist videos of pleasant things. She booby-traps a nasty grocer's apartment because of the way he treats a sweet, slow young man preoccupied by the late Princess Di. She directs a jealous man to a hypochondriac tobacconist in the hopes of making them both happy, sends her lonely father's garden gnome around the world (her father is still grieving for Amelie's mother, who was killed by a suicidal Canadian tourist leaping off a cathedral), and her landlady who still grieves for her late, unfaithful husband. But then Amelie encounters a dreamy young man, Nino, and finds a collection of photographs that he has collected. Will Amelie be able to do for herself what she has done for others -- and fall in love?<br />It certainly says something about \\"Amelie\\" that all the copies were virtually unavailable in my area for the longest time. It's a very sweet, cute, romantic film with a lot of nice visual tricks and likeable characters. If you don't like movies where people can fall in love at first sight, paintings talk, goldfish commit suicide and statues wink, then you won't like this -- one of the best moments is when a quartet of photographs tell Nino that he has fallen in love with Amelie \\"in your dreams.\\" (It takes a lot to make me melt, but that did it) And it's very rare that in movies, people do nice things just for the sake of it. One of my favorite scenes is Amelie guiding a blind man down the street, rapidly describing the things around them.<br />And the little visual tricks, while they aren't totally necessary, are a nice touch to the movie -- Amelie being so unhappy that she turns into a puddle of water, her heart speeding up as she makes eye contact with Nino, and watching news reports about her life on the TV. Romantic moments abound -- a scene where Amelie and Nino hesitantly kiss parts of each other's faces is exquisite. And it's funny too, from the suicidal goldfish to the travelling garden gnome to the grocer's booby-trapped apartment, especially the speed dial that calls a psychiatric ward.<br />Audrey Tatou is wonderful as Amelie, managing to be mischievous and innocent, sweet and sad. Matthieu Kassovitz is vastly underrated as Nino Quincampoix, a dreamy young man who works at an adult video store with a gyrating stripper (yes, it's an odd place for Amelie's soulmate to work, but just watch!). Serge Merlin is good as the likeable, gruff, grumpy Dufayel, Rufus is poignant as Amelie's withdrawn dad, and all the supporting actors weave together in a complex plot that centers on... Amelie.<br />Like Amelie herself, \\"Amelie\\" is sweet and cute and funny and likeable, quirky and romantic. If you have even an ounce of romance in your soul, then sit back and visit \\"Amelie\\" in Paris in the springtime.ll Nino that he has fallen in love with Amelie \\"in your dreams.\\" (It takes a lot to make me melt, but that did it) And it's very rare that in movies, people do nice things just for the sake of it.

B0000067L4|4.0|Over 30 years later and the album still has an intensity you don't find in much of todays music. But then again,there have been few bands in music like Cream.&quot;I'm so glad&quot; starts off the live tracks with the furious intensity their live concerts were famous for. And the studio tracks show their love of the Bands music. Clapton has said &quot;Music from big pink&quot; influenced the studio tracks. Don't bother with the myriad jam bands that came after them and tried to equal their music,just go right to the source!
B000002U82|5.0|It's all like a rock symphony, Only state of the art differences. It sounds like it was barely made. The songs are so beautiful, I never could have picture there could of been a album so good. I guess I was wrong right when I heard: &quot;A) Speak To Me  B) Breathe&quot; , Then it all went superior when it hitted the song &quot;Time&quot;, everything was perfect and you'll have goosebumps by the time you listen to &quot;Money&quot;(You'll get into the song), then you'll have some kindda feeling in your stomach when you listen to the beautiful &quot;Us and Them&quot;, and you'll be saying the same thing I'm saying by the time the album is finished.<BR>Trust Me! A album you will wanna buy.
B00000ICD9|5.0|Most unique and unforgettable story told about love.<br />After his death in a car accident, Chris Nelson begins to adapt to his new existence in heaven (that place can only be described as such). Shortly after, his bond to his mortal wife Annie is broken as she takes her own life and is banished to an eternal damnation. Guided with his unconditional love Chris begins the journey to hell and back to rescue Annie's sole, so they can share eternity together.<br />Complemented with great performances, great writing and simple but excellent story, this film is truly a visual masterpiece.
B00008977N|5.0|From start to the glorious finale, there's not a lull. The band is a collection of some of the best musicians on the planet. David Rhodes and Tony Levin are incredible; as is Peter's voice. The special effects are truely amazing but don't get in the way of the music. I've made alot of new Gabriel fans by showing them this concert. Glad it's finally out on DVD.
B00008DDXC|5.0|It is very hard to get a 31 year old man excited about the movie, but I could not wait for this one to come out. And of course I was the first one in line to see it. Brilliant movie. <BR>First of all, movie was very closely kept to the book just like the first one, for which I must give thumbs up to the filmmakers. <BR>Second, entire cast returned to recapture the magic in this chapter with some excellent editions, couple of which I must name: Kenneth Branagh portraying Gilderoy Lockhart. When I was reading the book, person I pictured in my mind as professor Lockhart was exactly who I saw in the movie. Kenneth Branagh did an amazing job delivering his character. Jason Isaacs portraying Lucius Malfoy - larger then life performance. What a cast. Brilliant performances all over. <BR>Third, for all who are worried about the length of the film: it is non-stop action. There is not even one boring second in this movie. At the end of it I could not believe that almost 3 hrs had past. I did not want it to end. <BR>Forth, visual presentation of this movie is immaculate. Special effects are incredibly well incorporated with real characters. People involved in creating such perfection definitely deserve recognition. <BR>As far as the story goes, I trust everyone interested in watching it has read the book or at least has seen the first movie. This chapter covers the second year of school for Harry. Everyone is a little older (and not just characters - actors as well) and a little wiser. Story is getting more complex and challenges are more frightening and harder to overcome (its going to get harder as each year goes by). It is an amazing story and it was presented in an amazing way. <BR>This movie is better then the first one - as hard as this may be to believe.
B000089RVX|5.0|Okay so last night was my first time I heard Evanescence's song &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;. I rarely watch MTV or listen to the radio since both plays horrid music. I immediately loved what I heard. I even tolerated the lite rapping from the guy from 12 Stones. An all around great hard rock song.  During one of my breaks at the office, I went out and bought the cd &quot;Fallen&quot;. I loved every second of the cd, especially the ballads. I am definitely reminded of Italy's Lacuna Coil, heavy metal with minimal goth influences. Being a massive goth fan (and a bigger music snob), I would most certainly would NOT categorize Evanescence's music as being goth, nor does the label &quot;goth-metal&quot; exist. I can't stand Linkin Park and I fail to see the comparisons of this band with one of the worst rock bands in existence. Amy Lee's vocals is absolutely amazing. She reminds me a bit like the lead singer from Kidneythieves but more so of Diva Destruction's Debra Fogarty and Curve's Toni Halliday. I found the lyrics to be beautiful, if not transcedent. I was speechless when I first heard the gorgeous ballad &quot;My Immortal&quot;. Truly one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard in hard rock. I honestly think that Evanescence has a lot of promise, which is saying a lot for me since I find most of today's new music derivative and bland. I look forward to hearing more from this band in the near future.
B00000K19E|5.0|There are only two things about this movie that I will mention:<BR>One - very unique and quite disturbing story - the world is a hoax. It is an elaborate deception created by artificial intelligence that controls us.<BR>Two - visual effects, they will blow you away.<br />This is one of only three movies that I've ever watched in a theater more than once. Let's hope that second chapter is as good as the original.
0385504209|5.0|This fast pace novel will keep you going to the end. Its one of those novels that you don't know who to trust as everyone has their own secret agenda.  I can't wait to go back and read his earlier works.
B000002KIE|5.0|The first and only original recording by the sex pistols is one of the greatest in rock n' roll history and possibley the best in the short yet eventful history of punk rock.  This is one the few albums that don't loose it's appeal over the years it's just as good and useful now as it was in 77.  It is an impossiblility to create a greatest albums list and leave never mind the bollocks off. This record truley changed the face of music.
B0000542D2|5.0|This is a phenominal movie. A Beatle classic!
B00008AY3L|5.0|This album rocks. More upbeat than his past efforts. Definitely not &quot;Fight For Your Mind&quot;, but come on he can't play the same stuff forever. Must be Jack Johnson wearin' off on him! I really like the funkier approach. Anyway, give this cd a try, you'll like it. Oh yeah, Pres. Bush gives goat!<br />Booyah!
0920668364|1.0|This book is creepy -- I would never read this to a child of any age.  Wouldn't want my child to think I would crawl across the floor to look at him while he's sleeping, especially when he reaches his teenage years.  Ever heard of privacy? Understand where Mr. Munsch was trying to go with this, but the result is seriously warped.  I have a hard time believing that this book was written by the same person who wrote the wonderful stories \\"Stephanie's Ponytail\\" and \\"Thomas' Snowsuit.\\"
0060934913|5.0|Let me begin by noting that I'm not in the food business.  I'm not even all that great an ameteur cook, though I enjoy good food and I _am_ slowly learning the ropes by entertaining friends and family with my forays into lovingly made cuisine.  So perhaps it wasn't just an accident of fate that my friend Shawn gave me this book as a gift to help me on my way.<br />The book is a fun read, full of the sort of anectdotes that make a book hard to put down, but with a level of brutal honesty that is rare.  The tales of food, sex, drugs, theft, harrassement, assault, and business that make it clear that there's [stuff] going down that he can't even tell you about in a book without having it relegated to keep company with porn videos in some sleezy adult store way downtown.<br />Yet with all it's great moments and warnings for the wise diner, what struck me most were the life lessons about integrity, honor, hard work, community, and loving what you do.  Tony reminded me that the real joys in life come not from having the best boss, the best employees, the most money...it's finding what you love and living that life with like minded travellers.  For him food and running a great kitchen makes the 17 hour days a joy.  Maybe it's where I am, but even though food isn't _my_ thing, what Tony says in this book makes a lot of sense.
B00002MZ4V|2.0|I was highly anticipating the arrival of my John Williams Greatest Hits CD, and boy was I in for a letdown. WARNING: MOST TRACKS ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDING, AND DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO COME CLOSE. IN FACT, THEY WERE PROBABLY INTENTIONALLY DOING IT THAT WAY. The way too fast tempos for the themes of Schindler's List and Jurassic Park (the only ones I bought the CD for...) really ruin the purpose of me buying this CD. I wouldn't have minded re-recording tracks, but geez, MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT'S THE SAME SONG. I don't even know what the other tracks were supposed to sound like, but, I'm sure they don't sound like they're supposed to. The only tracks that actually use the original recording are the Superman theme, the main title from the Reivers, Hymn to the Fallen, Seven Years in Tibet (apparently, same year...), JFK's Prologue, The Days Between from Stepmom (again, apparently), the Main Title from Home Alone, Summon the Heroes, the Rosewood music, and the Star Wars Episode 1 music. If I would've known this, I would have rather bought each individual soundtrack from a record exchange. But what can you expect from the Recording Industry Association of America? A compilation that has what the customer wants? Original (at least sounding) recordings at the same volume level? (Ace of Base Greatest Hits...) Don't think you're getting that with this. Although the sound volume level and quality are good, which is why this gets a two from me...
B00005NI5Y|4.0|I must say that I am appreciating the talents of Bob Dylan the more I listen to his music.  Love and Theft is certainly a very charming release by Dylan that is just dripping with textures.<br />Although there are many blues driven songs on this release, there are plenty of acoustic driven ballads and even a couple of old time swing numbers.<br />At times Dylan's voice is oh so raspy.  However there is a certain earnestness that exists particularly on such mellow tunes as Bye and Bye and Po Boy that makes you appreciate Dylan in spite of some technical shortcommings.<br />What really elevates this CD is the performance by Dylan's band.  Steady drumming and cool slide guitar licks are very noticeable throughout this CD especially on Lonesome Day and Honest With Me.<br /> Some of the songs do go on a little longer than desired but overall this is a prime time effort for Bob Dylan especially at this late stage of his career.
B000059MEK|1.0|after having homework as my soundrack, you could imagine my excitement when i heard daft punk was releasing a new album.  so i bought this, and i had never been more disappointed.  i can't even give this cd away it's so bad.  it is nothing like homework.  daft punk sold out and this cd is commercial.  i hope they get their act together and go back to their roots!
0553296981|4.0|This book is full of excitement, sorrow, laughter, and love. Like most girls my age, Anne is going through a rough time. She wants to be loved in a certain way and is having a hard time dealing with the fact that her parents and sister are different from her. Although she confides in her father sometiimes, her main source of support is Peter Van Dann. He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Van Dann who also live in the \\"secret annexe\\". Peter and Anne have talks and like to see each other. Anne falls in love and wants to know what Peter is thinking. All the while Mr. Dussel, whom also lives with the two families, is so furious because in his mind, children there age should not be spending so much time with the opposite sex. Mrs. Van Dann is one of those people who think that she is better that everyone else. Mr. Van Dann is one of those quiet people who think that if they don't make too much noise, they won't be noticed. Anne's mother is very emotional, and her sister is a very intellegent person. Her dad is very strange. I changed so much ever since I read this. I realized that I am not the only person that feels like this and some people do understand me.
B00006F83Y|5.0|On my first listen of this album, I thought... Ok, a few good songs, but most of them feel too poppy and similar. On my second listen I decided that about half of the album was actually pretty good. And so it has continued until I have listened to it about 15-20 times now. Now I think that all of the songs are very distinguishable and all of the songs were good except 2 songs that were too poppy and Six Shooter, which was annoying. The negative reviewers that say all of the songs sound the same and are too poppy probably just listened to the album once... and if you like music that is simple enough to be judged on first impressions then you don't know music. Go pick up a Linkin Park cd and leave those of us that have brains alone.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This was the first Nickelback CD I've heard, and after hearing some of their previous music, which I also loved, I think it is their best so far!<BR>1. Never Again- great song, good music, although the violence kind of disturbed me.<BR>2.How You Remind Me- The reason I bought the CD. GREAT great song, although I've gotten a bit tired of it from playing it too often!<BR>3. Woke up this morning- another solid song<BR>4. Too Bad- In my opinion, the absolute best song on the CD. I love the significance after i heard that its talking about Chad's dad that abandoned them.<BR>5.Just for- again, the violence kind of disturbed me, but i like the guitar and the way it sounds.<BR>6.Hollywood- my least favorite on the CD. Definitely the least catchy. but it's still a good song, it's not like I would skip it when listening to the CD or anything.<BR>7.Money bought- I love the guitar melody on this one. in general another good song.<BR>8.Where do I hide- one of the best songs on this CD.<BR>9.Hangnail- another one of my favorites, i love the chorus on this one.<BR>10. Good Times Gone- I mainly like this one because I am in love with Chad's voice, and he's doing softer singing rather than yelling in this one. Really interesting music too...really blue-sy or country-y or something like that....but has the rock part during the majority of the song as well.<BR>Overall, I highly recommend this CD.
B000001E3L|5.0|We look forward to visiting family in the Bay Area every year and have such a wonderful time every time we go.  I can't think of a better way to top off a great day in the Bay Area, doing whatever you enjoy, than to go to one of the shows when this disc was recorded.<BR>It is a celebration of all different types of music in one place (oftentimes, and amazingly, in one song).  From the opening horn riff of &quot;Did Ye Get Healed&quot;, you know these aren't just run of the mill, ordinary performances.  The medleys are absolutely incredible - I can't figure out which one I like best.  They are each little journeys.  Whether the journey is through Van's deep catalog or through music history itself it takes us to different and beautiful places.  The quiet beauty of &quot;In the Garden&quot; is met by the rousing crescendo of &quot;Vanlose Stairway&quot;.  Even the &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; Dylan quote on the coda of &quot;I Forgot That Love Existed&quot; is a brief, yet priceless stop on our journey.  Certainly not one that I'd want to miss.<BR>I also think that the featured guests add a wonderful versatility to this performance.  They allow Van to take his ideas about arranging a song in different ways to new places.  Brian Kennedy opening &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel So Free&quot;, only to give way to a rip roaring Van then leads us to some incredible harmonies.  Jimmy Witherspoon provides some solid, bluesy vocals.  Candy Dulfer's sax is on fire, especially on &quot;I'll Take Care Of You. . . &quot;.  This cd should be played loud or listened to with headphones because of the great interplay between ALL of the musicians.<BR>This cd is a must-have for anyone. . .  As everyone has started  saying, &quot;see the back for what's inside,&quot; and more!
B00004XONN|5.0|it is very logical to say that this album doesn't conform with what one would expect from ok computer and the bends but it is great nontheless. i personally think mixing electronic music with classic radiohead sounds very cool. i don't know why they approached this album the way they did but it doesn't really matter to me. i've enjoyed this album.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Wel, overall, i thgought he movie was excellent. the casting was doneincredibly well, inlcuding giving Drew Barrymore as little lines as possible. I also really enjoy a movie that makes me a think a little bit which is somewhat of a rarity in films these days. Jake Gyllenhaal, who i already think is an awesome actr and has incredible talent, played down a little to much for this role but it was still entertaining. The way they made \\"Donnie\\" look like a complete schizophrenic was really cool because in reality he had created almost seperate reality for himself in which he found it possible to delay his death and therefore trade it in for his mothers plane not crashing those 28 days later. I would ave to say one thing that really upset me, was the fact that this movie was said to take place in the late 80's, but yet, had i watched it wth no time frame, i would have honestly believed that it was made in the present. Other than that, no critiques. I seriously suggest this movie for anyone wo wants to think during a movie.
B000001EHS|4.0|The main reason why alot of people complain that this album isn't heavy enough or isn't definitive enough is because it focuses only on the pop charts only. Though many of the songs here were hits on both rock and pop charts, if it didn't do well on the pop charts it isn't here. Dispite how well it may have done on the rock charts. Though there are some hard rock songs (Animal, Photograph), even they were produced with Top 40 in mind to some degree. In my opinion more so than other \\"hair rock\\" acts of their day. Maybe if there were more heavy moments I wouldn't notice the pop elements of these songs as much. Infact, the only song here that really neglects the pop music in favour for rock (yet still did well in both fields) is \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me.\\"<br />Does this mean that this is a bad album? Not at all. Infact it is easily one of the most listened to CDs in my collection. Yes, there are quite a few ballads, but almost all of them are well produced and full of emotion. And maybe there is a bit of a Hysteria overkill, but don't forget that record is one of the best-selling albums of all time!!! And each one of those songs were big its and deserve a place on this collection. And even though that many of these rock songs won't have you banging your head like Motley Crue or Iron Maiden will, they are still very good and enjoyable. <br />If you were a child of the 80s and listened to Def Leppard on Top 40 radio, but weren't liberal enough to venture into the world of hard rock enough to buy their records, then this collection is for you. And even if you were a fan of the band, you will still find this a valuable addition to your collection. If you are a newbie, then maybe you may find it a bit soft, especially from a band that goes by the name \\"Def Leppard,\\" but chances are you will still like this album. Just as long as you understand where it is coming from.
0385335482|5.0|This is one of the funniest books I have ever read (seriously)! The even funnier thing is that I swear that Sophie Kinsella has been using me as her model for the &quot;heroine&quot; Becky Bloomwood!! I can honestly say that I have had most of the same escapades that Becky has had (although I have not had the misfortune of having to dodge my bank representative-YET). I own all of Sophie Kinsella's books (just bought her new book- &quot;Shopaholic Ties the Knot&quot;). If you love a good laugh and love to read, then I highly recommend this book!
0140288503|5.0|Destined to take it's place among war classics, Black Hawk Down is the story of the events in Somalia on October 3rd, 1993. <BR>The books details a raid that the stationed U.S. Army Rangers staged against Mohamed Farah Aidid, a warlord who declared himself president of Somalia, and was hampering U.N. efforts to feed the starving country. <BR>During the midafternoon, about 180 elite Amry Rangers and Delta Force troops dropped into Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, where they were to capture two lieutenants of the warlord. <BR>Right as the mission began, things went wrong. One Ranger fell eighty feet from the Black Hawk that he was in to the ground. The Somalis, who were excited due to the raid, and due to the drugs that are common among the population began to attack the soldiers who also opened fire. Before too long, a fierce fire-fight began. After the prisoners were loaded onto the convoy of humvees and flatbeds, the convoy began to move out. <BR>Then disaster struck. Using RPGs, (Rocket Propelled Granades) a Somali managed to hit on of the Black Hawk helicopters that was flying over head, causing it to crash to the ground, killing the crew. The soldier's mission changed from a raid to a rescue mission, and they had to fight their way to the crash site. The convoy was turned around, and proceeded to the crash site, but the trucks got lost, resulting in the deaths of a couple soldiers riding back. <BR>Soon, another helicopter was also hit, and crashed, killing several of the crew, and this time, there was no rescue for the survivors. <BR>By the end of the mission, which was supposed to last for an hour, but dragged on into the night, 18 soldiers, of the Rangers and Delta Force were killed, and 73 were seriously wounded. Three more Black Hawks were shot up and forced down, but they returned to the base where they were stationed. <br />This story is among the most horrifying and realistic that I have read. Bowden pulled this story off spectacularly, and I felt thatI was in the action while reading it. It flows quickly, making the book about a 1-3 day read. The book divides cleanly into thirds. Right off the bat, he drags us in with the troops going into battle, then backs up and described the base life, and the mission backrounds. Then he moves onto the attack, and then onto the aftermath and rescue of the only surviving pilot, Mike Durant. <BR>Bowden's description of the battle is as realistic as can be. As the soldiers landed, he describes their reactions and thoughts, and accuratly shows the tensions between the Delta Force and Rangers. As the fight escalated, he also describes the Ranger's need to get to the crash sites, with problems between them and the air and the Somalis fighting them. <BR>This is a true war classic.
B000002J0B|5.0|\\"The Song Remains The Same\\", \\"The Rain Song\\" and \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" are, in my humble opinion, the best songs the Zeps ever recorded. A sensual bluesy rocker, a gentle acousting tapestrie and a folk song ...funky hard rocker, these might not be the most played Zep tracks (\\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and \\"Kashmir\\" still hold that distinction), they are certainly some of the best. Almost everything about them is perfect, every guitar track, every bass line, every drum beat. It would be worth getting this CD just for these tracks.<br />What about the rest of the album? It's quite good. There's some stuff here that'll make you roll your eyes up, like the silly funk workout, \\"The Crunge\\" and the catchy but stupid \\"Dancing Days.\\" But listen to Plant get down with da riddim, mon as he play some of dat reggae in \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" (pronounced \\"Jamai'ker\\") \\"No Quarter\\" is definitely the creepiest Led Zep song ever recorded. It's so ominous, foreboding and mournful that it could have been recorded by Black Sabbath in one of their more experimental phases. \\"The Ocean\\" is a fun rock work out that'll get stuck in your head. <br />But really, they could have just recorded sounds of the bands farting and telling bad jokes and I'd still love \\"Houses of the Holy\\" because of those first three tracks I mentioned.<br />Can you dig it?
0743219619|3.0|P.D. James pulls out all the gothic stops.  I sometimes wondered whether she was parodying the gothic genre.  The characters and dialogue are unrelievedly morbid, but with a certain amount of depth.  The plot is sort of slow.  This is the second gothic novel set in Dorset I have run across recently (the other is Ex Libris by Ross King).  I shall never visit Dorset.  I liked this novel enough to finish it, but I don't think I will read any more P. D. James.  Her detective is too introspective, sensitive, and filled with self-doubt.
006092988X|5.0|Its such an amazing book. So many times I found my eyes full of tears. The characters just leave the pages of the book and come to life around you.<br />A must read for anyone who cares for books and human emotions.
0140277447|5.0|This is arguably the most powerful piece of nonfiction that I have ever read, period. It documents some of the worst atrocities to have ever been inflicted upon human lives since the Dark Ages. Truly, the Massacre of Nanjing was and forever shall be the \\"Forgotten Holocaust\\", and it is so only because the cowardly Japanese, even now, refuse to admit to such terrible warcrimes. Even the Nazis, unlike these inhuman barbarians, had the courage to admit wrong and submit to justice. Japan is a country without honor, and they shall be shamed for all eternity.
B000084T18|5.0|This CD has it all from violent war songs (Heat) to smooth jams (21 Questions).<br />Stand out tracks include:  Heat, Poor Lil Rich, Gotta Make it to Heaven and Life's on the Line.<br />I would highly reccomend this CD to fans of all types of rap.
B000001DV2|3.0|That sounds like an odd thing to say about the band that made pop and rock almost synonymous in the 80's. Well, this is the first Def Lep album of the 1990's and the first one with the one-armed drummer. The quality is definitely there as it is in every album these boys make. But &quot;Adrenalize&quot; tries too hard to please. Perhaps the Leps were afraid of passing away into hair-metal obscurity along with so many of their peers. <br />So what of this album? It's good. &quot;Let's Get Rocked&quot; is the predictably catchy opener with a sense of humor. I know I couldn't get enough of the song when it first came out. Do I want to sit back and listen to it now? Heck no. It's the kind of song that eventually becomes irritating after a while. &quot;Heaven Is&quot; another insanely catchy tune that you get sick of after a while. &quot;Make Love (Like a Man)&quot; is my least favorite track on this album and perhaps my least favorite Def Lep track. I just don't like it or find it that funny. &quot;Tonight&quot; is a very typical power ballad that doesn't quite soar into the stratosphere. &quot;White Lighting&quot; is a bit of a throwback to &quot;Pyromania&quot; days. A good old fashioned rock song. &quot;Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion)&quot; takes us back to some schmaltzy FM territory. It's a decent song but it sounds like something Brian Adams would record! &quot;Personal Property&quot; is another throwback to &quot;Pyromania&quot; a song that actually rocks. &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot; is yet another pretty FM ballad that was played to oversaturation back in the day. In retrospect, it's a pretty average song. &quot;I Wanna Touch You&quot; is more bland pop-rock but the imminently catchy &quot;Tear It Down&quot; is a pretty good closer.<br />In conclusion, &quot;Adrenalize&quot; is probably not the best Def Lep album. &quot;Pyromania&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot; were their creative zenith and this is sort of a nadir. I haven't ever listened to&quot;Slang&quot; or &quot;X&quot; all the way through so I am not going to call it the worst Def Lep album. But if you like catchy, commercial songs, you'll enjoy this album.
B000083C49|4.0|The movie is funny and stands up as perhaps the most entertaining of the series.  But Disc 2 in my set, the disc with the supplemental material, has a major flaw:  the individual selection choices for b-t-s docs, etc., don't highlight.  You can't really tell which item your remote is selecting.  After a bit of trial and error you can maneuver through, but it takes quite a bit of experimenting.<br />Perhaps other customers may or may not have had this problem.  I know my DVD player works fine, so maybe this particular batch of discs is flawed.<br />So keep a lookout for that.  The material still plays (so far), but navigating through and selecting the material you want is VERY user-unfriendly.<br />Hopefully most consumers won't encounter this problem, but surely I can't be the only one who has.
0064407667|2.0|First of all, I want to state that I am very passionate when it comes to 'good' children's books.  The HARRY POTTER books are some of my favorite books of all time (my top twenty list).  The Newbery Awards were all given to deserving books that I have adored.  For a while everywhere I went, the Lemony Snickett books were being lauded as fabulous children's literature.  After seeing a segment on CBS Sunday Morning, I went out and bought the whole 'shebang'  (is that even a word?) at my school's book fair (I'm the counselor)!  I was terribly disappointed with the first book.  Yes, it is easy reading, and yes, it does introduce new words (even though my parents always said, \\"Go look it up, you'll remember it!\\").  But the content of the story is so depressing and so unhappy that I was miserable the entire time I was reading!  Character development was so poor that I wasn't even sad when horrible things happened to these children.  Normally I cry when a baby is kidnapped, bound with duct tape (even over her mouth) and put in a birdcage to hang from the top of a tower!  Well, I didn't bat an eye (and I become a sprinkler when reading a Patricia Polacco book).  <BR>There are eight books left in my crowded library to read; I'll keep you posted if they get any better!
B0000508U6|4.0|On first listen, you might think this is just another Radiohead, but further listen reveals there's more than another clone. Another brit band getting a quite significant following here in the States(and Canada). Although their most recent album, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is better, this is quite a promising debut with some good songs.<br />Don't Panic: A quite interesting album opener. Using guitar pedals to great effect creating an eerie kind of atmosphere, it's just a bit short. 7.5/10<br />Shiver: Energetic opener to start it off, with a quite pretty guitar line during the verses with Martin's quite trademark high vocals during the chorus. Quite good song 8.5/10<br />Spies: Pretty good song driven quite a bit by acoustic with electric adding some touches and a chord or 2. Nice song to just lay back on and listen. 8/10<br />Sparks: Another quite slow track. Very ambient sounding which isn't a bad thing, it's almost relaxing to listen to. 8/10<br />Yellow: Ah yes, the big single from the album. Opens with the now familiar chord intro followed by the electric providing the main melody. Lyrically it's a quite sappy love song but it's a good song so screw it. 9.5/10<br />Trouble: This is kind of a mixed bag. His singing during the verses is kind of annoying but it picks up in the chorus. Very piano driven. Quite cool video though 8/10<br />Parachutes: Voice and guitar for 46 seconds. Uh...ok. 7/10<br />High Speed: This song is a bit average sounding. Quite cool guitar line under the verses. Nothing really to say about the song. 7/10<br />We Never Change: Again, it starts off with an acoustic playing some chords. Another spacey track with some nice touches of electric guitar and piano. Quite slow song in an album that seems full of them 7.5/10<br />Everything's Not Lost: Again with the slow songs but this one is very piano driven. Guitar adds a neat little riff now and then. Nice bassline providing a different melody than the rest of the instruments. 8/10<br />This album is promising. There's some faults(what's with the slow songs?) but they got a lot better on the next one, this is just a good starting point
B000000WZ4|5.0|Depeche Mode went through a dangerous period after their 1993 epic, Songs Of Faith & Devotion. First, David Gahan, their lead singer nearly died of a heroin overdose in 1996 but miraculously cleaned himself up and rejoined the band. The other blow to the group was the departure of Alan Wilder. Despite the calamities, Depeche Mode returned in 1997 with their ninth studio album and their first as a trio and Ultra doesnt disappoint one bit. In fact this album surpassed all of my expectations.<br />Dark, frightening, eerie, and mature are the words to describe the mood of this album. The blurry black, purple and white colors in the background perfect suit the overall mood of the CD. The black and dark purple portray the darkness of the lyrics, and of the music. The lighter colors portray the sense of hope, redemption, recovery, and moving forward after near demise. These are just how I see them. This album makes me think of running through a severe rainstorm and embracing its darkness and intensity. Thats how I describe the albums mood.<br />This album is a departure from the heavily guitar driven style of Songs Of Faith & Devotion and more of a return to the keyboard based pop of their signature but maintaining some of the SOFAD elements. Overall though, this album has a completely different mood from SOFAD or Violator or the ones before them. Depeche once again morphed their style and for me, I like change even though a small part of me yearns for a Black Celebration Part II. This album is definitely an ULTRA masterpiece. Theres some sense of joy and happiness meshed in with the angry, depressed atmosphere of the songs. This album is in my opinion, the extreme opposite of Speak & Spell. Every song on this essential CD is at least a 4 and a half but Home, Its No Good, Freestate, and Insight are by far the best on this CD with Insight being the best of all. Theres plenty to find in every song on this album.<br />Barrel Of A Gun starts things off with a guitar-driven, and menacing song that SOFAD fans will more than likely enjoy. This song almost sounds like a Nine Inch Nails track at times. The Love Thieves is a jazzier, and trippier song that foreshadows the lighter direction that the group would take on their next album four years later. I like this songs odd chord structure. Home starts with a somewhat scary melody and a screeching sound effect that reminds me of a ghost screaming in the distance. It starts as a dark, and disturbing song with a dark and eerie mood and becomes a warm, orchestral song. I love the climax with the rock guitars and the orchestras coming together at the climax. Martin Gore has never sounded better on this track in his entire career. Its No Good radiates with its pulsating bass, and punching beats. This song from perspective is about how searching for love is just in vain Dont say you love me, cause its no good. Uselink is a cute electronic instrumental. Useless is a definite SOFAD-esque song with a somewhat of a Soundgarden-esque sound. This song reminds me somewhat of Black Hole Sun from years ago. Great song. Sister Of Night is a beautiful and textural song with a bitter and dark mood. I like the strange guitar, or keyboard sound effects. Jazz Thieves is another cute and instrumental. We then head into one of my favorite tracks on the CD Freestate. This song is one of the best songs of Depeche Modes career. It starts off with a dark and eerie melody and some gorgeous 12 string guitars and becomes an intense and brooding song with rumbling beats and keyboards that remind of Enjoy The Silence from Violator. When I play this song, I can imagine myself tangoing with a woman dressed in black in a severe thunderstorm on an open city plaza. ;-) The ending is really cool too. I wished that this song wouldve been released as a single. The Bottom Line is a bittersweet song with a bit of a country flavor but still being very dark and bitter in mood. The closing track Insight  is by far my favorite song on this CD. It starts as an ominous electronic number with a dark black & white mood, and then becomes an uplifting electronic Gospel influenced song with a sense of hope and looking towards the future. Wait and minute, its not the closer. The real closer on this CD is actually a hidden track called Junior Painkiller. This short instrumental is an odd and bizarre song. Its a great song  but Insight shouldve been the closer. This is a good instrumental nonetheless.<br /><br />Ultra was a vital outing for DM, not only because it was great but because it showed that even with Wilders absence, they could still crank out the good songs. While I enjoy  Exciter a lot, Ultra in my opinion a sense of edge, heaviness, the darkness, and a bit of fright, that I feel was missing from the 2001 release. For me, Depeche Mode shines when they make dark, frightening, electronically intense songs than simply mellow, joyous songs but maybe its just because I embrace dark music.<br />Alan Wilders departure couldve spelled the end of Depeche Mode or if they carried on, they couldve used every excuse to put out a dud of an album or even disbanded. Instead the threesome readjusted to their status as a trio, carried on and put out a masterpiece.The Bottom Line is a bittersweet song with a bit of a country flavor but still being very dark and bitter in mood.

B000000OQY|4.0|I am a huge fan of Guns N'Roses (see my slobbering review of \\"Appetite for Destruction\\") and I regret the fact that they imploded just as they had reached their creative peak. Here's a nice little snapshop of an L.A. hair metal band (with a 'tude) coming up through the ranks, kicking butt and taking names as they went along. <br />\\"Reckless Life\\", like the entire A side (I still think of this as a cassette tape) was first released on the unattainable \\"Live! Like a Suicide EP\\". The song just tears your nuts out. There's some classic Axl wailing and a classic Slash guitar solo. \\"Nice Boys\\" is a Rose Tattoo cover and it's not bad. Kind of rough around the edges. \\"Move to the City\\" is another cover but I can't remember who wrote the original. \\"Mama Kin\\" is also a decent cover of an Aerosmith classic. This is pretty standard stuff - one original song and 3 covers. But then we get to the B side. There's some budding song-writing talent here with the gentle \\"Patience\\", with it's whistling intro and acoustic guitars. \\"Used to Love Her\\" is a hilarious country-ish song about killing and burying your girlfriend in the backyard. \\"You're Crazy\\" would end up on the \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" album, amped and speeded up. But this version is superior. \\"One in a Million\\" is a controversial song but perhaps one of the Gunners best slow songs. In my opinion, these are the only Guns albums you need to own.<br />\\"Appetite for Destruction\\"<br />\\"Lies\\"
B000000W6X|5.0|the song Spying Glass introduced me to the band...but my first actual album was Mezzanine, which I liked a lot.  But this one I'm starting to like much better.  I like the more hip-hopish beats on this one, and its a lot more mellow.  Spying Glass is just an amazing song to me...and I also like Karmacoma.  The whole CD is great.  Pick this one up :)<br />Oh...and ignore the last track.
B000060P79|3.0|Great cd! If you love Simple Plan you should give Sugarcult a try...and pass it on to all your friends! Enjoy!
0783225903|1.0|Brazil is ultimately a failure on all counts.  The plot, such as it exists, centers on a mid-level worker eventually confronting a society crushed underneath a byzantine system of rules, regulations and paperwork.  The world depicted evokes images of such uniquely 20th century works as 1984 and THX-1138; the human soul repressed and minimalized by totalitarianism and the machine of the state.  The particular target of this satire, however, is bureaucracy.  Unfortunately, while some of the visual design and over the top imagery is intriguing, the movie brings very little new or insightful beyond the premise of bureacracy run amok.  Indeed after the first few minutes, the message is clear: rules shouldn't obscure humanity.  But rather than present any kind of plot to interest the viewer, we're treated to variations of this theme interspersed with sheer boredom.  A love story is included as well, complete with dream sequences.  These sequences, regrettably, are poorly handled.  In a movie with such a surrealistic texture to it's visuals, one would hope for some depth to a dream sequence;  messages and themes should be filled with depth and revealed in layers.  Instead, here they unfold with all the subtlety of an adolescent dungeons and dragons fantasy.  None of this is helped by the fact that the story follows the classic arc of character revelation and disillusionment in laborious starts and (mainly) stops - nothing interesting ever seems to happen.  Finally, the movie just isn't funny.  And a satire without laughs is one of the most painful of viewing experiences. <BR>   Taking this together with it's lack of insight and slow narrative, Brazil is a remarkably bland experience.  Seldom have I watched a bad movie so bereft of any redemptive factors.  By the final few minutes one is left not caring at all how the movie ends; just hoping that it will and as soon as possible.
B000000OSG|4.0|Taken as a whole, the second volume of \\"Use Your Illusion\\" falls far short. It is good by any normal standards though. \\"Civil War\\" is a great, great song which actually tries to say something. \\"14 Years\\" is also a great little ditty but then there's an awful cover of Dylan's \\"Knocking on Heaven's Door\\" (complete with chorus girls) and the inexcusably stupid \\"Get in the Ring\\" in which Axl gets to vent against his critics. At this point in his career, Axl was known to have been listening to a lot of gangster rap. That might explain this silly song. \\"Shotgun Blues\\" is angst-ridden but not a very good song. \\"Breakdown\\" is a little bit better. The distorted vocals get tiresome after a while. \\"Pretty Tied Up\\" is perhaps one of my favorite songs on this album. It is catchy and has an interesting story to tell. \\"Locomotive\\" is a good guitar workout but it is quite long. \\"So Fine\\" is a good reminder of why Duff Kaegan's solo career bombed. The guy CANNOT SING! \\"Estranged\\" is the Gunners \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", a long rock song with no real chorus, just a bunch of distinct parts. It's kind of contrived. \\"You Could Be Mine\\" is a good ol' fashioned rocker. \\"Don't Cry\\" is the same song as on \\"I\\" only with different lyrics. Yawn. \\"My World\\" is just a strange freakout. In my opinion, \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" is the more superior of these two volumes. But they are both worth owning!
B00005AAFS|5.0|this is possibly one of the greatest conceived metal albums of all time, Sehnsucht was incredible, but this...this is the Essential Rammstein.  the songs are just so damn catchy and it is my solemn guarantee that you'll be spinning this CD repeatedly every day for at least a month, or until you find something better, which will be extremely difficult, BUY MUTTER NOW!!!  their videos are really good too, and they're quite a spectacle on stage, these guys know how to perform, and if you've never heard of them, well, something is definitely wrong with you.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is a great CD made by and at the same time not made by Linkin Park. It includes artists like:Jonathan Davis(from Korn),<BR>Aaron Lewis(from Staind), and Chali 2NA(from Jurassic 5)just to name a few.Oh, and all you people that say that their second album is bad because it is just a remix album, I have some news for you THIS ISN'T THEIR SECOND ALBUM. <BR>Listen to this quote from the bass player of the band, Phoenix<br />&quot;...the remix album was a project that we did in between albums; not in lieu of a second, but in between the first and second. We wanted to explore the hip-hop, and electronic porions of our music, and at the same time work with some artists that we have respected and loved for a long time. Had we not done the remix album, the second studio album would not have been finished any sooner. We take a long time to write new songs... we are very picky, and we never want to do anything half-way. The beauty of Reanimation is that we were able to write and work on album 2 while it was being remixed by the remixers. If you don't like it, then you don't like it. Personally, I love it... I think it turned out great. And if you demand an album a year out of a band, then I'm sorry not to have met your required rate of production... but good things do come to those who wait.&quot; <br />I'd also like to say that people who want another album don't have to wait very long. Linkin Park fans mark your calendars,because MARCH 25, 2003 the new and SECOND album Meteora comes out.
B00006IU73|5.0|This is fisrt PT album recorded in America and released by Atlantic (US label). I think that people in US will like it. Thas all. It`s a box full of very nice music. Maybe some of you (after hearing In Absentia) would like to buy older albums. I`, not shure if the older things are avaiable in US. Enjoy it !
B0000026T4|2.0|I like the 70's Alice Cooper a lot. Theatrical rock'n'roll with creepy/weird conceptual lyrics. But TRASH is really just Cooper running with the then massively popular hair-metal guys.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Let's face it, when you first get a Playstation 2 and a few games, your going to need a memory card no matter what, and Sony's 8 MB card is the best one money can buy for the system.  It has fast loading time when your saving your games, you don't need any kind of disc to boot it with (some other cards require one and they are a pain), and it is undoubtadly the best card on the market for a current supported system.  True, you can't save your old PS1 games onto it (though you can still use your old PS1 cards on your PS2 for PS1 games), and it is the most expensive card for the system, but then again, it is the best money can buy.  Do yourself a favor, no matter how cheap third party PS2 Memory Cards might be, don't give in, they don't work half the time, and Sony's is the most trouble free card on the market and is an essential buy if you own a PS2.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I love this soundtrack! When I went to see the movie that the best movie I ever seen. All the songs are great,(except for tracks 17 and 18).
B000002UV9|5.0|Empire is one of the best of teh pop metal/power metal albums around. Ranging from commercially pleasing melodic hooks to powerhouse bass guitar/bass drum chest-thumping rhythm parts, from low, baritone, reflective vocals to soaring, operatic changes, and dynamics from quiet &quot;lucidity&quot; to hard-grooving power metal.<br />&quot;Empire&quot; has got to be Queensryche's most refined and mature sounding project to date. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING! It's alright to have a purified, aged sound as long as it is premium music, which is what we have here.<br />If you're looking for less-refined, raw metal, this album is probably not for you. However, I recommend listening to this one until you understand what it's about, beyond just the lyrics or the surface music. Listen to the emotion and virtuous writing from the inside out.
B000002KHH|5.0|From the ominous opening proclamation of &quot;War Pigs&quot; (&quot;Generals gathered in their masses/Just like witches at black masses&quot;) to the frantic freakout that is the title track to the stomping cry for revenge that is &quot;Iron Man&quot;, PARANOID is not only a rock classic but is the only rock album that any long-haired, black nail-polish wearing, faded denim wearing teenager of any generation can relate to. This is why PARANOID has such lasting appeal. It doesn't just stomp your nuts though. &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; is actually quite a beautiful song. It is solemn and minimalistic. &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; and &quot;Hand of Doom&quot; are just plain freaky, loaded with apocalyptic imagery. &quot;Rat Salad&quot; is an extended drum solo (skip it) and &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot; is the ultimate, unchallenged, unbeatable all-time stoner anthem. What does this all mean? PARANOID is heavy metal heaven before anybody really used the term.
B00005NB8K|5.0|Thanks to the unbelieveably meticulous direction from Oliver Stone and the hypnotic sublime performance of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, The Doors is an undeniable masterpiece of film. The late 60's and early 70's era is re-created brilliantly as we see the rise of a young Morrison who went from a poet to being the frontman of one of the defining bands of the century. Kilmer's performance must be seen to be believed (he looks, moves, and sounds exactly like the late Lizard King), and he is clearly the most underrated actor of his generation. An all star cast is brought together with Frank Whaley (Pulp Fiction) as Robby Kreiger, Kyle MacLachlan (Blue Velvet) as Ray Manzarek, Kevin Dillon (The Blob) as John Densmore, and Meg Ryan as Jim's long time girlfriend Pam. The rest of the ensemble cast includes Michael Madsen, Michael Wincott, Billy Idol, and Kathleen Quinlan. All in all, this is one of the definitive films of the 90's, and is a must own for fans of The Doors or Kilmer alike.
B00006HBUB|5.0|I did not think anyone could have done Scooby cinematic justice, but then I could never have foretold of the genius of Raja Gosnell in bringing this most noble of Danes to life.  Who but Gosnell could have translated into live-action the existential miasma that permeated the original cartoons like an inky cloak, a cloak that invariably contained Mr. McGumbly underneath many layers of hideous disguises, like a ghoulish matryoshka doll?<br />Mr. Gosnell must be part Dane himself to convey with such unerring poignancy the deeply lachrymose yet pulchritudinous serial existence of Scooby, an existence bound in the tiny nutshell of the Mystery Machine and the stagnation of comic foils such as Shaggy, Fred, Velma, and Daphne, with the sometime, though never often enough, appearance of that intrepid eyas Scrappy-Doo.  A small measure of the director's faithfulness to the spirit of Scooby, that melancholy Dane, may be glimpsed in his most famous of soliloquies, \\"Rroo rree orr rrot rroo rree, rrat rriz rrruh rrreschun.\\"  Unfortunately, however, the printed word cannot convey the power of his words, nor can they overcome the limitations of his doggy vocal chords.  But his ideas speak truths even through the translations of his faithful boyhood friend, Horatio.  I cannot hope to add to Scooby's insights, so I close with his own words:<br />\\"To be or not to be, that is the question:<BR>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to beg<BR>For the heroin-like goodness of Scooby-snacks,<BR>Or earn them despite a sea of troubles,<BR>And by staying eat them?  To crunch:  to munch;<BR>Oh more!  And then I say good-bye to all<BR>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<BR>That flesh is heir to, 'tis a doggie treat<BR>Devoutly to be wish'd.  To crunch, to munch;<BR>To munch, perhaps to float: ay there's the high;<BR>For in that sleepy death what creepiness comes<BR>When we have gone into our happy place<BR>Must give us pause:  there's the respect<BR>That makes calamity of this delight;<BR>For who would bear the ghouls and ghosts,<BR>The really scary monster, the haunted house,<BR>The pangs of hunger, breakfast and lunch delayed,<BR>The insolence of Fred and the spurns<BR>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<BR>When he himself his Scooby-snacks could take,<BR>With a bare bodkin?  Who would Velma bear,<BR>Who loses her stupid glasses all the time,<BR>But that the opiate that is the Scooby-snack,<BR>The chemical delight whose recipe<BR>Is known to only Shaggy, puzzles the will<BR>And makes us rather bear those ills we have<BR>Than fly to others we know not of?<BR>Thus Scooby-snacks make addicts of us all;<BR>And thus the native of hue of healthful life,<BR>Is sicklied o'er with delirium tremors,<BR>And enterprises of great pith and moment<BR>With this regard their current turn awry,<BR>And lose the name of action.\\"
0060920432|5.0|A really interesting read, full of the history of psychology.   It can be a bit of a slow read, unless you love studying and learning about psychology & the mind, because it has so many details about historic studies, that it reads a bit like a history book.     It delves into the history of psychology as well as a modern analysis of how focusing one's energy can help us to accomplish everything we want.  It's much more clinical & detailed then most 'self-help' genre of books.
0792107683|5.0|SHANE is usually on anyone's list of favorite Westerns. It is a story about a range war between cattlemen and homesteaders in Wyoming. A loner named Shane (Alan Ladd) rides into the thick of the battle and settles down as a guest of one of the farmers (Van Heflin). Shane is trying to forget his past as a gunman. He is much admired by Van Heflin's son (Brandon de Wilde) and also in a seemingly innocent way by Van Heflin's wife (Jean Arthur). <br />The movie is filled with an abundance of memorable scenes. One is a gunfight between a hired killer (Jack Palance) and a stubborn homesteader named Frank 'Stonewall' Torrey (Elisha Cook, Jr.). It is hard to believe that Palance was not comfortable with horses as suggested by the Internet Movie Database.<br />The big competition for Academy awards in 1953 came from ROMAN HOLIDAY, STALAG 17 and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. In spite of the tough field, SHANE still managed to win an Oscar for best Color Cinematography and nominations for Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (Brandon de Wilde , Jack Palance) and Screenplay.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This is the film that would influence hundreds of action films for years to come, made director John McTiernan a household name, and made a global superstar out of Bruce Willis.  Willis stars as New York Detective John McClaine, who goes to Los Angeles to see his wife (Bonnie Bedilia) and family, but finds himself running and gunning for his life when a group of terrorists take over the Nakatomi building holding hostages (including his wife), and only McClaine can stop them.  As the Amazon review says, Die Hard would set the stage for action films for years to come such as Under Siege, Passenger 57, and Executive Decision; but none of those films could ever match the intense action (possibly some of McTiernan's best directing in his career), engaging cinematography (courtesy of Jan de Bont who would later helm another action masterpiece with Speed), and fantastic performances from Willis (his wisecracking one liners would also set the stage for future big screen heroes) and Alan Rickman as the nefarious head terrorist Hans Gruber.  This Five Star edition of the film is great and is undoubtadly one of 20th Century Fox's best produced DVD's on the market.  The great picture transfer allows us to see the brilliance of the film, and the commentary from McTiernan is worth the price of admission alone.  The branching scenes don't add much to the film, but they themselves are a nice extra.  This blockbuster would also spawn an inferior (but nonetheless action packed and fun) sequel that was directed by Renny Harlin, and McTiernan would return to the helm for the third and in my opinion best installment, Die Hard With A Vengeance.  All in all, consider this essential viewing if you've ever called yourself an action film fan.

The main Characters in the book are Suyuan Woo and her daughter Jing-mei Woo, An-mei Hsu and her daughter Rose Hsu Jordan, Lindo Jong and her daughter Waverly Jong, and Ying-ying St. Clair and her daughter Lena St. Clair. The main characters told the past stories of their childhood, and how they came to America. Throughout the story each woman told of some good adventures and some hard problems they dealt with in their lives.  Jing-mei is my favorite character because I thought she is a nice person.  I like her determination to be better than Waverly Jong, who is good at everything. <BR> In some ways I can relate to some of the characters in the story. I can relate to Jing-mei because she always tries to be better than everyone else. I can relate to that because I used to do that when I was younger.  I often tried to impress people. But, in the end, it never worked out, just like Jing-mei. While reading the book I shared some of the thoughts and feelings of the characters.  As each woman told her story, I completely knew how she felt.<BR> I really enjoyed reading the book. It gave me an idea of how the Chinese culture was compared to the American culture. The only part I would change would be that the author should give more detail about Jing-mei's new family.
6302752337|4.0|EASY RIDER is a fairly entertaining relic from the counterculture of the sixties. The fingerprints of Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper are all over it. Fonda is the producer and Hopper is the director. In addition, the screenplay is the result of the collaboration of Terry Southern with both of them.<br />The story is about two free spirits (Fonda and Hopper) on a motorcycle trip from Los Angeles to New Orleans. Along the way they hook up with a drunk (Jack Nicholson) whose performance provides some of the most memorable scenes in the movie.<br />The main competition for awards in 1969 came from MIDNIGHT COWBOY, TRUE GRIT and THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE. In spite of the tough field, EASY RIDER was still able to win nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson), Original Story and Screenplay.
B000069HKH|5.0|Okay, so I'm a fan of the Boss, big deal!  Ater all, who says a guy who listens to stuff like Iced Earth and Dream Theater can't kick back with a little old-fashioned feel-good rock n' roll?  I've respected Bruce for years and I've always admired him for his commitment to his work and what he enjoys, plus the fact that he makes music for himself and his fans, and not Toyota Civic commercials is a definite plus.  That, and I can't help but give it up for a fellow New Jersian who makes it big:)<br />In case you didn't know, (which is quite unlikely considering how Bruce and this album have been just about everywhere lately) &quot;The Rising&quot; is Bruce's response to the events of 9/11, and his cry to America to keep it together and stay unified.  Judging from the widespread success of this album and the tour that followed, you can't help but think that he's succeeded.  To help him further get his message across, he's recruited the help of the E Street Band, for their first time playing together in nearly a decade.<br />There's no doubt about it, despite the sometimes depressing subject matter in certain songs on this album, (&quot;Empty Sky&quot; and &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; focus a bit on those individuals who have lost a great deal from 9/11) this album realy makes you feel good.  Just about everyone should have a record like this; something you can turn to when you don't feel like listening to someone whine about the problems with the world and would rather hear someone sing about hope and staying strong.  Even if the lyrics didn't really give that kind of an image (though they certainly do) the music alone on this disc is more than enough to get the blood flowin' and pump just about anybody up.<br />The best thing about this album is how Bruce and co. can seemingly effortlessly grab you by the...well, ears I guess and hold on for the duration of the album.  From the first drum beat right before the band really kicks in on album opener &quot;Lonesome Day,&quot; right down to Bruce's last passionate croon on &quot;My City of Ruins,&quot; you never get the urge to push the skip button for even a second.  Every song on this album is entertaining and the band refuse to pull any punches.  What you're getting here is Bruce and the E Street Band at the top of their game and working with each other proficiently to deliver an album that soars and does wonders for the human spirits.  Anyone who felt particularly affected by the events of September 11th should definitely give this album some of your time; Bruce is talking to you and he's delivering a message that will not be ignored.
B000089CKH|2.0|This album is a total disappointment.  I heard many good things about this album from fans of Weezer and just critics altogether.  I really don't get a lot of people are raving about this album.  Although there is nothing significantly wrong with this album the songs just sound boring and repetitive.  It is like listening to the same mellow, surf song ten times over.  The only song I enjoyed was Killian's Red but the rest of the album you could easily toss away.  Basically this album is just boring ...  Now I have heard songs from previous Nada Surf albums and if they could have captured their energy of old then they might have come out with a album worth listening to.  But until then stay tuned...
6303921248|3.0|I bet most people here praising for this A&E version of \\"Pride and prejudice\\" haven't seen the 1980 BBC's version or even read the book. The ealier BBC's version is less known because it's not advertised as much as this one and it's more than 15 years older. The A&E version is good in its detailed potrait and fine production. It has a more modern taste to the original Jane Austen's novel. The earlier BBC's version is more theatical played by a superb cast, esp. Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul in the leading roles as Lizzie and Darcy who are true to the book. You may disagree about some characters. I strongly urge those who like this A&E production go and watch the other BBC version so that you can get a full taste of the original Austen's \\"Pride and prejudice\\".
B000089RVX|5.0|Let me start by saying that generally writing these reviews is a waste of time.  No matter what I say, someone else will always contradict it.  Very few people actually read them, and are you honestly going to buy/not buy a cd based on what I have to say?  That being said, I still feel it is important to review items that left an impact on me, both negative and posative.  Now to compare this band with other &quot;similar&quot; bands.  1st up, Linkin Park.  I have only heard a few songs of theirs, and from what ive heard of them they arent as dark or heavy as Evanescence, and unless one of their guys is actually a girl, then they also dont have a chick in their band.  Now to compare them with other female singer bands.  They are better than any other female-led band ive heard.  Plain and simple.  Finally, after all my valuable insight, I can talk about the band.  But first, Im gonna let you know where my opinion is coming from.  Im a metal head, all my cds are metal (Mudvayne, Slipknot, System of a Down).  I dont own any cds like this one or any cd that isnt metal because every other time ive shopped outside the metal genre, I have been seriously disappointed.  Now that my life story is over, I will actually write about Evanescence.  Amy Lee (the vocalist) is the standout of the band.  She has a harmonic, almost angelic voice, and is decently hot.  The rest of the band has moderate to good skill, and as far as them ripping off Linkin Park riffs and whatnot, like I said Linkin Park is never that dark or heavy.  And besides, most new ideas are just simply improvements on old ideas.  The band as a whole has heavy instruments (except for the occasional piano/orchestra) that remind of Disturbed.  This mixed with the talented and beautifil voice of Amy Lee still impresses me.  This cd is awesome, even an anti-mtv metal head like me endorses it.  I strongly reccomend buying this cd, it will not disapoint you, no matter what style of music you like.  Also, if you like Evanescence, check out 13 Ways to Bleed on Stage by Cold.  Its good too.
0790731894|3.0|The beginning of this film with the strike team and later the civilian analyst who advises the military has the feel of a Tom Clancy novel. While not nearly the quality of a Tom Clancy story, it does have an excellent cast which makes it enjoyable to watch. The flight sequences are just too unbelieveable to take seriously. There is a lot of action and an engaging plot which will keep your attention. I enjoyed this film just from the all star cast.<br />While this is a good film, I recommend Tom Clancy's series based on the character of CIA Analyst Jack Ryan. (The Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games, Clear And Present Danger, The Sum of All Fears.)
B000002H72|5.0|Anybody that has a shred of good taste should admit that this is the album of the eighties along with a few other excellent records. As I have seen someone say before critics may say that this is their most accessible album, but only one song is really that accessible, that being Gouge Away. This album is practically flawless although La La Love You and Silver are just slightly a let down, for The Pixies mind you. If only all new wave sounded like Debaser, then I would be a fan of all the eighties. Yeah most of The Pixies revolve around death and mutilation, but that doesn't matter because they can write many a good pop song. I don't think a pop fan without a shred of integrity could not like Wave Of Mutilation or Here Comes Your Man. This album also hits you with some harder, Nirvanaish tracks that prove the influence. These would be Tame, Debaser, and Gouge Away. And of course there are many odd songs on here (i.e Crackity Jones, Mr. Grieves). This album also has the impeccably classic Monkey Gone To Heaven. What more could you want in an album, I can't think of anything.

B00005JLRT|1.0|This supposed \\"final chapter\\" of the TNG crew was nothing short of an abomination. It's obvious the cast just showed up for the paycheck, because the acting was tired, and most of the lines that were meant to make fans cheer and laugh were met in the theatre with groans and silence. To make matters worse, the whole film looked as if it was shot in a very dark room.    The villain Shinzon, instead of being a truly formidable foe, turned out to be a whiny, bald-headed brat in charge of a gaint killer starship. Why, after all this time, has \\"Q\\" never been the subject of a Star Trek film? He is almost as popular as the Borg and yet he's passed over for inclusion in a TNG movie time and time again!      It's a shame that the magnificent journey of the \\"Next Generation\\" crew had to be tarnished with garbage such as this. Apparently the film was slashed to pieces, judging by all the cut scenes available on the DVD, but sadly the film wouldn't have been any better had it been unabridged.         Why Rick Berman and the producers felt obligated to kill off one of the main characters is beyond me. The only reason I can think of is that the actor who played this character WANTED to be killed off, since in Star Trek, heroes ALWAYS figure technical ways out of every life-or-death dilemma. Maybe like the franchise, he felt worn out and tired of it all.     If you're a Trek fan, don't bother with this film, and pretend the whole thing never happened. Great casts should go out with a bottle of Dom Perignon, but sadly, this film can't even measure up to sour grape juice.

B00006CXXU|4.0|In the past often mentioned in one sentence with Britney Spears regarding how down pop has sunk, Christina Aguilera out of the blue released one of the best pop albums of 2002. She is not a teenager-only star anymore. Just take her voice and you know she's made it to the other side, where artists dwell.<br />\\"Stripped\\" is not a too cohesive piece of work, but it does not really matter, as it showcases Aguilera's potential for being a great singer. For now, though, her youthful unbridled energy dominates the project -- and her image, often blatantly erotic, which however she does not need to resort to to capture attention...<br />Most typical for Christina are still ballads in Mariah Carey vein (\\"Soar\\", \\"The Voice Within\\", which slightly resembles Shania Twain's \\"From This Moment On\\").<br />Dave Navarro's guitar gives the edge to \\"Fighter\\", which hails as if from Michael Jackson's \\"Bad\\" album. On \\"Lovin Me 4 Me\\" the neo-soul similar to Jill Scott's is offered. One of the best cuts is \\"Beautiful\\", a tense ballad cooperation with 4 Non Blondes' (remember 'em?) Linda Perry. But perhaps the most surprising is relentless \\"Make Over\\", a Hole-like, with Christina embracing her independence and cheekily adorning the song with Oriental voice riffs at the end. Other highlights include \\"Walk Away\\", a piano bar ballad and a subtle party jam \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\".<br />On the other hand, missteps can also be found. \\"Underappreciated\\", besides being mediocre, owes much to the Salt'n'Pepa/En Vogue mid 1990's hit \\"Whatta Man\\". Rapper Lil' Kim cooperation \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" tries to be an anti-sexist anthem but ends up rather pathetic. \\"Gals, with this kind of songs you will not change the society.\\" The closer \\"Keep on Singing My Song\\" is also not good enough to end that good album as \\"Stripped\\" definitely is.<br />Overall, though, Christina Aguilera is convincing. \\"Stripped\\" is full of promise and a rather high bar to jump over next time. If you just barely think of getting this album, do so. I think you will not regret it.
B000002KNU|4.0|one of the most of the most important and innovative bands of all time.  They put together new wave, punk, and pop to make one remarkable, defining sound.  Talking Heads basically formed the genre known as quirk rock (i.e. Pavement, Weezer, Pixies)  This is the Talking Heads first album, and as you guessed it came out in 1977.  I would say that this is not their best album but it is sure quite a debut album.  The first track Love Comes To Town basically sums up the whole album, a 'venture into the crazy, looney mind of David Byrne.  I think Byrne's vocals must have influenced Black Francis to sing very oddly.  Byrne can't sing, but the vocals are all the better for it.  This album for the most part keeps your attention, which for the most part is what you want your album to do.  This album has a quite a few gems including Pulled Up, First Week...Last Week, Carefree, and The Book I Read.  But no doubt the defining song of the album is the absolute classic, Psycho Killer.  This song remains one of the Talking Head's best songs.  If you're looking for eclectic music, look no further than '77.
B00000JY1X|5.0|In these 69 tracks, Stephin Merritt's opus explores a wide range of musical styles, from bubblegum to punk, improv jazz to old country.  It is a remarkable achievement on a number of levels, but perhaps most for its combination of intelligence and listenability.  One certainly doesn't need to be a fan of indie- or art rock to fall in love with 69 Love Songs (although a liberal view of love might be necessary).<br />Unless you have no patience whatsoever for Merritt's musical indulgences, I'd like to make the strongest possible case for buying the box set instead of an individual albulm.  The original idea behind this production was a 100-song revue, which was shortened to 69 as &quot;No one would want to sit through a revue like that.&quot;  Each of the three discs have tracks worth listening to repeatedly, and the albulm as a three-disc whole makes a much better tour through modern love as concept than any individual one of them would.  The box set also comes with a thick booklet containing a long interview with Merritt on every one of the songs by Daniel Handler, as well as a number of pictures.  With apologies for the over-used expression, this set is a &quot;must-own&quot;.
B00005JKGI|5.0|I love this movie.  I have a video copy.  They are currently filming a remake of the movie using the new Mini Cooper.  My guess is that the release of the original movie on DVD is being deliberately delayed in the United States pending the release of the remake or even the DVD of the remake.  In England the original 1969 movie was rereleased to theatres ayear or so ago and the DVD followed quickly thereafter.

0553801511|4.0|Middle books of planned trilogies are difficult, as they must necessarily not be complete in themselves, but can only build the setting for the last book. The middle book of the last of three related trilogies must be even more difficult. Haven gotten through the Assassin and Liveship Trader sets (and if you haven't, you need to before tackling this set - you won't regret it), and Fool's Errand as a the first book of this set, this becomes an obvious bridge work between all that has gone before and (presumably) the tie-up of all the various plot threads in the last volume.<br />FitzChivalry Farseer is once more the star, opening this volume as a very much-wounded man, having lost his bond mate, and forced to once more try to fit in to the court intrigues by playing the servant to Lord Golden as Tom Badgerlock. New problems almost at once descend upon him, from his adopted son Hap's wayward ways to complications in his own love life, while the pressures of the Piebald group mount upon both Fitz and the kingdom, and Prince Dutiful's training in the Skill becomes an imperative, regardless of Fitz's own feelings of inadequacy in matters of the Skill. Add in problems with the Outisland delegation and Dutiful's promised bride, and the Bingtown traders requesting help in their war against Chalced, and there are more than enough plot threads for several novels.  But the focus of this book is not so much in unraveling all these threads, but rather in Fitz's development as a person, along with all the people around him. Throughout this book, we see Fitz make errors in judgement, fail as a parent, as a spy, a lover, a teacher, as a friend. Each error leads to further growth of the man as he tries desperately to fix all his self-imposed problems while also working to aid the kingdom in what he sees as the best way possible.  Lord Golden is exposed as having even more personas than previously known, each equally as enigmatic. Lord Chade comes into his own as a real human, with understandable desires and forgivable failings, and even Hap becomes a very recognizable young man with a very normal set of young man's problems.<br />This is therefore a quiet book, without a great deal of surface action, but with a great deal of character development, and the setting in place of all the things and characters needed for a final denouement. As the characters make up so much of the charm of this entire set of interrelated stories, it is a fully satisfying book, even though it has no real ending, and with possibly even more questions raised than answered within its various disclosures of tie-ins between the various plot threads.  The only real problem with this book, like almost every other middle book of a series, is the agonizing wait for the final volume.<br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)understandable desires and forgivable failings, and even Hap becomes a very recognizable young man with a very normal set of young man's problems.  <br />This is therefore a quiet book, without a great deal of surface action, but with a great deal of character development, and the setting in place of all the things and characters needed for a final denouement.

B000002UAO|5.0|When talking about the musical genius of the Beatles, this album is probably the best launching point. This is where their innovations and musical diversity really started to show. They moved past some of the weaker, hooky, pop type stuff and moved into a new realm of creativity and output. 'Norwegian Wood' is far and away my favorite song of all time. It sums up one night stands in a profound yet simple and catchy way with George on indian sitar. 'In My Life' is also a classic that will endure for centuries into the future. About change and the terminal nature of life, few if any songs have ever covered this subject better. 'Girl' is a feel-good high-as-a-kite track about the fickle, unsatisfiable nature of females. Who can argue this point? 'Drive My Car' is a thinly veiled attempt at sexuality and the price of fame. Listening to it makes you realize the almost super-human harmony of this phenomenal and ground-breaking quartet. 'Wait', 'The Word' and other tunes round out this incredible LP. If you're into contemplative mood music, you would be hard-pressed to find a better album/C.D. in all the world's musical history! Obviously, when talking about the Beatles you run out of superlatives to describe what you're hearing. Buy this one today and see for yourself why it is truly larger than life.
1400034779|5.0|This is a beautiful little book. Its presentation is lovely and almost childlike at times. There are genuine mysteries to be solved here, but even though the individual stories are short, this is not &quot;mystery light.&quot; The author creates some really memorable characters and presents an interesting sense of place (with Africa's Kalahari as the background), but more like a soft, fuzzy dream than a detailed picture. This is a place where witch doctors rule, where cobras nonchalantly climb into cars. The author uses simple language full of wisdom. One chapter is titled &quot;Mma Ramotswe Thinks About the Land While Driving Her Tiny White Van to Francistown&quot; -- and that's exactly what it's about! Here's more: &quot;They taught us ... a language which is good for telling people what to do. There are many words for push, take, shove, carry, load, and no words for love, or happiness, or the sounds which birds make in the morning.&quot; and &quot;So for many years, nothing at all happened. It was a good system of government, because most people want nothing to happen. That is the problem with governments these days. They want to do things all the time; they are always very busy thinking of what things they can do next. That is not what people want. People want to be left alone to look after their cattle.&quot; READ THIS BOOK! It's full of joy. I'm going to read the next in the series.
B00005OWEG|4.0|...\\"Apocalypse Now\\" is the flawed masterpiece that broke Coppola.  Hallucinatory and mesmerizing, it's basically an analysis of the American involvement in the Vietnam War on LSD, if you will.  What the \\"Redux\\" does is restore about 1 hour of footage cut from the original 1979 release.  In terms of length, \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" is about as long as \\"The Godfather Part II\\", and the new scenes don't necessarily add all *THAT* much, although some of the gratuitous nudity is nice!  :-)<br />Kilgore (Robert Duvall) is fleshed out a little bit and isn't quite the bloodthirsty tyrant he appears to be, although that isn't saying a whole lot.  The last 1/3 of the film with Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is still a bit muddled.  Finally, the two biggest \\"new\\" scenes are rather pointless, but are filled with blessed gratuitous nudity.  First, a weird scenario where Willard (Martin Sheen) trades fuel for some time with some wacked-out Playboy Playmates.  Second, a visually interesting but tedious diatribe from some angry French colonials who are still P.O.'d that they lost Dien Bien  Phu back in 1954.  However, the beautiful French widow who later seduces Willard rescues the scene.  YOWSAH!!  YOWSAH!!!  :-)<br />Anyhoo, since I've never seen the original 1979 version, I can't really compare it to the \\"Redux\\".  However, while this movie still has it's flaws, it's a fascinating piece of American cinema ...
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is a contradicting pastiche of beauty, ugliness, happiness and nastiness. The Beatles rock harder than they ever had (&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and &quot;Revolution I&quot;) and yet, they are equally content at finding a new level of quiet introspection (&quot;Julia&quot; and &quot;I Will&quot;). While it's true that the sound of the White Album is the sound of The World's Greatest Band splintering beyond recogniton, it is also true that the stunning variety of musical styles contained within make the disc the most adventurous of the Fab Four's career. <br />Nearly every musical genre of 20th Century Western Civilization finds a home on this double-disc monster. The Beatles give us Folk(&quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;), Country (&quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot;), Vaudeville (&quot;Honey Pie&quot;), Neo-Classical (&quot;Martha My Dear&quot;), Heavy Rock (&quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;), Fifties-Rock(&quot;Back in the USSR&quot;), Blues (&quot;Yer Blues&quot;) and Experimental Art-Rock (&quot;Revolution 9&quot;). In the hands of lesser talents the White Album would surely be a disjointed mess, but somehow the Beatles managed to sew the whole thing together into a beautiful cohesive masterpiece. This may not be the Beatles' best, but is certainly their most interesting. Rubber Soul, Revolver and Sgt.Pepper are more consistent and arguably stronger efforts, yet none matches the tenacity, the hugeness and the variety of the White Album. This is a must for any serious music fan and it remains, to this this day, the quintessential double album.
B000088E6P|5.0|The album is something I been waiting to hear. However, its not the album that I rated the 5 stars with, but that its 50 cent that I rated. This guy really does know what he is talking about. He really has taken da rap game to a whole new level.

I have listened to Jonny Cash my entire life but never bought any of his music till now. If you're new to his music, this is well worth the purchase. If you're a Johnny Cash fan you'll probably enjoy this sound track. This is a wonderful bridge of the past to the present and Country to modern music. Only something Johnny Cash could do.
B00006690G|3.0|... This cd could have been better if it had less pointless skits, and gross lyrics and swearing. Don't get me wrong the swearing doesn't bother me but its kinda boring to always hear swearing and the rapping could have been more vicious. Oh well heres a little info on each track.<br />1.CURTAINS UP(skit): you hear classical music and then you hear foot steps and then you hear eminem say hello.<br />2.WHITE AMERICA: a great vicious song with very angry lyrics. I like eminems vicious rap, ... Great song, and interesting chorus. 8/10<br />3.BUSINESS: a very catchy song, with interesting sound affects, and yes it is great to party to, but i think i prefer him vicious. Good song. 7/10<br />4.CLEANIN OUT MY CLOSET: a song about his life. This song shows his talent at songwriting, though i think this song was way to overplayed and too slow. 6/10<br />5.SQUARE DANCE: another catchy, interesting song. The ending of this song really remindes of the song on his old album called amityville. This also is another good song to party to. 7/10<br />6.THE KISS(skit): talks about how he went to jail, nothing special.<br />7.SOLDIER: yay another vicious song. This song as well has very angry lyrics, and i love the sound effect in the middle where you hear gun shots and sirens, excellent. 9/10<br />8.SUPERMAN:i don't like this song he sounds like a popstar with an annoying voice. 3/10<br />9.DRIPS: a very gross song featuring some ... rapper named obie trice. This song is very boring. If you enjoy eminems vulgar stuff you'l like it ... 2/10<br />10.WITHOUT ME: a ridiculously overplayed song, and yes its weak and he sounds very up himself in this song. 4/10<br />11.PAUL ROSENBERG(skit): his well known by eminem fans for his ... skits.<br />12.SING FOR THE MOMENT: a between vicious rap, weak rap song, with sad lyrics. This song is quite sad, and the chorus sounds cool with Aero smith in it, and i like the bluesy guitar at the end thats cool. 8/10<br />13.SUPERMAN: just a song talking about girls. Not very interesting lyrics, but his rapping is very smooth and it goes well with the music. This song is very relaxing. 7/10<br />14.HAILIE'S SONG: you propbably wont agree with me but i kinda think this song [is substandard], and no offence to him because he was trying his best to sing, ..., and it has to be the most overated song he's ever done. I just don't see whats the big deal about people going \\"oh my god he can sing\\", well so what if he can. Since this is a sweet song i added marks to it. 5/10<br />15.STEVE BERMAN: sort of funny.<br />16.WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS: starts off with very scary music. A very dark song with disturbing lyrics. A bit too rappy to my liking but i think it needs a 6/10<br />17.SAY WHAT YOU SAY: a very unoriginal song by em. It features Dr Dre, but there really is nothing special about this song. 5/10<br />18.TILL I COLLAPSE: features nate dogg. Starts off with an army march kinda music, not bad, pretty good but the chorus is a little repetitive and boring which is done by nate dogg. 6/10<br />19.MY DAD'S GONE CRAZY: a cute song featuring his daughter Hailie Jade, though i think their kinda mucking around in this song. Hailie sounds cute when she sings but she also sounds annoyin. 6/10<br />20.CURTAINS CLOSE(skit): pretty funny.<br />lokk please note that if you thought i was rating this a bit harsh please not that im not a fan of him and i would much prefer listen to metal. Thank you for reading.
0393039765|5.0|Fight Club isn't just a novel.  It is a look into our world, the world that are our friends, co workers, lovers, cab drivers, etc.  This book shows you a different view of this world.  The view is that everyone is scum, and we give up to easy.  Tyler Durden takes these scum and makes them proud to be alive.  Gives them something to live for other than a minumum wage 9-5 job.  <br />This book is incredible.  Its a book that should stand out though all ages in its type.  A story of how one man loses it all, maybe even his sanity, thats for you to decide, and makes life the way he wants it, and helps people think the same way.<br />Could this book be a Bible?  I wouldn't doubt that many that read this book are so taken aback from it that they may follow the rules of Fight Club and Project Mayham themselves.  Dont let this incredible book sit on the shelf in a bookstore.  Go and get a copy now.
B00006RIO7|4.0|After seeing Chicago (the movie), I picked up the revival cast recording, and I was surprised to hear how lackluster it sounded in comparison.<br />The motion picture soundtrack is far superior to the revival cast; everything sounds dynamic and intense, and I believe that the characters are really interested in their fates.  The music is good, and the source material (the musical itself) is great.<br />I could live without the bonus hip-hop stuff; hip-hop is fine, but these tracks are pretty lousy.  Still, the point of this CD is the musical, not the miscellany.  It's great.
0380002930|5.0|I remember, as a kid, watching the animated movie on tv.  Years later, I noticed the book on the family bookshelf.  I pulled it down and started reading.  I was lost in this makebelieve world with its own rules and language that Adams had created for me.  Later, I joined the military and decided to put together my own bookshelf.  I bought and read Watership Down again.  Now the political messages started getting through, as well as the theological ones.  This book is great but overlooked because people see a book about rabbits and move on by.  Don't be this person.  Escape to Watership Down.
6305508550|5.0|Yeaaaaaa, I'm gonna need you to use the TPS report from now on....I really wasn't interested in watching this movie when my husband brought it home, but it is now one of my favorites!  It's a cult gathering, and the minute you say those two little words &quot;ummmm, yeaaaa&quot; if you've seen this movie, you know EXACTLY what the person is talking about!  I love Jennifer Aniston in Friends, but this is one of her better parts.  It's small, but it just fits her.  GREAT movie and recommend it to ANYONE who loves comedy.
0380977788|4.0|Neil Gaiman is no stranger to writing strange tales.  Coraline is actually supposed to be a children's book, but I enjoyed it very much. The story is simple and easy to follow, and the characters were not over developed.  The book although somewhat scary and sureal had a calming effect.  Gaiman makes you believe in Coraline and you never truly doubt that she will come out on top.  I would be careful about reading this to kids.  It could scare them.  Very enjoyable story though.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Great music, except for one thing.  It's missing the power and the fullness of the sound, even Bruce's voice is thin on most of the tracks, which isn't Iron Maiden's fault.  It's the dope at the mixing board when they mastered the final CD.  However, when you listen to the Rock in Rio CD, and you hear the same songs, it rocks mega time!  Which is ironic, the band can set up the equipment for 1 night, and it sounds better than what the record company/recording studio could do with this CD for several days.  Whomever is responsible, give them the boot.  Other than it's recording issues, it's a great CDs, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I became a fan of Fiona's as soon as I heard Tidal, and I think When The Pawn is just as good. This one has a little more pop in it, but not in a bad or cheesy way. Except for a few songs, most are a little more up-tempo than Tidal. This album is a little grittier. 'On The Bound' is a moody but catchy song. Very good song. 'To Your Love' is not my favorite song on here, but is still pretty good. I think maybe she's trying too hard on the vocals. 'Limp' is very pop-sounding. Angsty lyrics. 'Love Ridden' is an absolutely beautiful ballad, one of my favorites on this album. Her voice is gorgeous in it. It's slow and has that sad, melancholy beauty that makes you fall in love with it. Great song. 'Paper Bag' is very catchy and musically has a happier sound to it. Pop/jazz. Good song. 'A Mistake' is very gritty sounding and has some guitar in it, which gives it a more full-bodied sound. Kind of alternative rock/pop. 'Fast As You Can' is a very original song. Throughout most of it, it has a fast, kind of frantic beat, but a couple different times, it suddenly gets slower and very bluesy and pretty. 'The Way Things Are' is very catchy and has a few rockish parts in it, but besides that has a kind of light-hearted tune to it. 'Get Gone' starts slow and light, but gets faster and very angry. Has a more full-bodied sound with moody and very [angry] singing.<BR>'I Know' is my favorite song on here, and one of my favorite songs of all time. It's a slow ballad, with a kind of Ella Fitzgerald sound to it, as someone else said in a review. It has a beautiful, melodic, sad tune. Very very bluesy and jazzy, but slow. This should be a classic. Anyone who liked Tidal should get this CD. Even though there are some differences, it still has that great moody, beautiful, bluesy pop-ish sound that Fiona has, and great piano playing. I highly recommmend this album.
B00007AJGH|5.0|If I had to write a one-word review of this deluxe 2-disc treatment of the landmark film WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, it would be. . .\\"Wow!\\"<br />Much like director Robert Zemeckis' BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy, time has done very little to tarnish the charm of this amazing fantasy film.  It's all the more impressive when you realize it was made without ANY computer animation.  Every cell of animation (all 80,000 of 'em) was done the old-fashioned way: by hand.  But enough about the film itself.  It looks and sounds great.<br />The Vista Series release gives you 4 options for viewing the film.  In addition to watching the film in your choice of widescreen or full-frame, you can choose from two informative supplemental tracks.  One is an audio commentary from the filmmakers, the other is a \\"Pop Up Video\\"-style feature which provides a constant barrage of on-screen tidbits about the film.  The pop-ups do tend to digress (yes, we know that Tex Avery influenced the style of Roger Rabbit, but do we really need Tex's biography here?), but they are nonetheless informative and often amusing.<br />A well-done half-hour documentary takes viewers behind the scenes.  And Charles Fleischer (the voice of Roger) hosts a more kid-friendly featurette that nicely evokes the irreverent style of its subject matter.  Plus, there's a fun \\"Toontown\\" game you can play with your DVD player's remote control, and a few other featurettes on various technical aspects of the production.  Oh, and the 3 original Roger Rabbit shorts that were shown with selected Disney films in the late 80's and early 90's.<br />A very impressive, exhaustive presentation that will answer every question you ever might have about this wonderfully fun and original film.
B00005A46T|5.0|The last two reviewers, I respect your opinions but come on to say that Slipknot's second album isnt heavy is just stupid.... Heretic Anthem isnt heavy?? Give me a break, if you knew anything about metal you would realize that Slipknot is one of the most heaviest bands out there today. Although I do agree the first album is better, the follow up IOWA sounds way better and is mixed a lot better. Of course Slipknot said themselves in an interview if your not a true Slipknot fan you wont be able to play this Album in your truck. So please True Slipknot fans pick this up. MY favorites on the cd - every song!
0553801511|5.0|I am avid reader of Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels and I must say that Hobbs books don't disappoint.  I found the Golden Fool to be an excellent addition to the the series thus far.  It is really difficult not to care deeply for Fitz, especially after all that he's been through.  I can't wait for the next novel and hope that his long journey has a happy and peaceful ending.
0345451325|5.0|As a huge fan of Halo who plays it online all the time, I really liked this book.  It went into a lot of the backstory of how Masterchief was found and trained.  It tells of many missions, then ends where the game starts.  Even if you don't know what Halo is (an Xbox game), you would still like this book.<br />Halo 2 has been delayed:o(  I need more Halo!!!!!!!!
B00004XONN|2.0|After browsing through some of the reviews that have accumulated here over the past fews years, its very obvious what type of person this album appeals to - Radiohead fans obviously, but in particular Radiohead fans who would under normal circumstances have to be forced to listen to this kind of music at gunpoint.<br />the effect was two-fold when this album was first released - people who found OK Computer \\"a bit weird\\" jumped ship to whatever whiney band was available at the time (Muse maybe?). The diehards dug in, proclaimed the ablum a work of genius and proclaimed everyone who critised the album not to be a \\"true Radiohead fan\\".<br />Most things that have been said here already are true,in particular that the sound is original only to people with a very limited taste in music -  take \\"The National Anthem\\", \\"Kraftwerk\\" getting beaten up by \\"Captain Beefheart\\" if I'm any judge. \\"Joy Divison\\", \\"Aphex Twin\\".... how many RadioHead fans own anything by these bands?<br />But the lyrics are great right? After all, we all know how it feels to wake up each morning sucking on a lemon. I was apalled (but not hugely surprised) when Thom admitted that at least half the lyrics for this ablum were pieced together by picking them out of a hat! That's genious? But hey, it must be, cos it sounds so like, deep. And trying to defend the album with cliches like \\"You must listen to all of it together to get it\\" is a pure cop out, a good song should stand on its own regardless.<br />It's telling that the only time the album sounds half way good is when the band actually try to write songs (\\"how to disappear  completely\\", \\"optimistic\\", \\"in limbo\\").  <br />So one of the best albums of all time, or else a desperate attempt to shake off the rock band tag that was getting increasingly annoying to Thom? Anyone can play guitar, anyone with a casio keyboard can play most of this album.
B000059QY3|5.0|I'm not an expert when it comes to opera.  I can hum along to a few songs here and there, but that's really the extent.  But I came home one day and saw this playing on TV, and soon found myself completely enchanted.  I did not move for the next hour.  The sets are absolutely gorgeous, grave and imposing, hightening the emotions of the story, mirroring the luscious and breathtaking score of Verdi's.  I've since seen bits and pieces of other sopranos' renditions of Violetta, yet none have moved me moreso than Gheorghiu, none have come close to capturing the character heart and soul.  The BBC was right to have filmed this production; it deserves to live on.
B00006LI4S|5.0|When I started seeing this concert i was expecting to see just a few good songs live or in an \\"unplugged\\" style. But i was completely surprised by a high quality concert with an incredible sound, a master execution, new versions of classic Pink Floyd's songs, some new Gilmour songs, well... I absolutely recommend this concert. (If you are a guitarrist, take a look to the \\"spare digits\\" section)
B000089RVX|5.0|I picked up this CD having no expectations at all.  I was at the local music store, previewing the NEW RELEASES.  When I previewed this CD, what I heard hooked me right away.  I never hesitated in putting this CD right in the cart. When I got to the car...I put it in the player and from that moment, took the most incredible musical journey since the first time I heard Alanis Morissettes \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".  NEVER since \\"Pill\\" have I become so emotionally touched by such awsome music AND lyrical artistry!  This CD screams originality and is all gold. This album delivers a hard rock sound yet the lyrics are delivered by the Beautiful YET Bold voice of the groups lead female singer. This is a welcome eliment as I have always loved the hard rock sound yet the SCREAMING throughout many of them just got TOOO ANOYING!  Believe me I could go on and on and on about this CD but I am just going to get to the point and tell you to do yourself a favor and BUY THIS CD.  If Evanescence does not become a HUGE HIT...AWARD WINNERS...and INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITIES, I totally lose faith in all humanities taste in music!!<BR> PLEASE....PICK UP THIS CD TODAY!!!!!!!
B00000K19E|5.0|I hope you had the opportunity, as me, of seeing this movie without any previous reference about it. Impressive. If not, you can always see it again and have a great time.
B000000OYN|5.0|Whitesnake's \\"Saints &amp; sinners\\" is an album that somehow never got the attention it deserves. Everybody's talking about either their heavy metal effort \\"1987\\" (featuring John Sykes)  or their hard blues rock masterpiece \\"Ready an' willing\\". But the truth is that \\"Saints &amp; sinners\\" is a very very good album. <br />On this release you get the original versions of both \\"Crying in the rain\\" and \\"Here I go again\\" which Coverdale &amp; Co re-recorded for the \\"1987\\" album. These original versions are better! \\"Bloody luxury\\" is a piano driven rock `n' roll song, similar to \\"Wine women an' song\\" from the album \\"Come an' get it\\". There's also a couple of fast rhythm &amp; blues based tracks like \\"Rough an' ready\\" and \\"Love an' affection\\". In \\"Rock and roll angels\\" as well as \\"Young blood\\", they guys are going for straight rock with no frills, and in the great \\"Victim of love\\" and \\"Dancing girls\\", they slow things down a bit but surely keeping the groove. This album should not be over looked.
B000088E6D|5.0|This is one incredibly smooth recording that showcases a remarkable vocalist. Mr. Buble has a magic in his voice and he sure knows how to use it. A very impressive style and obvious passion for the music he sings. It just doesn't get any better.
B00005NI5Y|1.0|Bob Dylan sure have done some great songs over the years, but this release is very lame and mediocre with the exception of Mississippi. The rest is nearly awful with Dylans whining, and nearly out-of-tune wailing voice. If Bob Dylans name wasnt printed on the cover, nobody in their right musical mind would pay any attention at all to this. At least it would not have an average rating of 4.5 stars  unbelievable! Theres nothing unique at all about this album, but since its the old legend Bob Dylan, youre fooled to believe its great music.
0060506989|5.0|Hey Robert,<br />The review is about the book, not the war.<br />BTW, the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese weren't exactly the freedom-loving, independence minded people you seem to think they were. They also happen to have the unfortunate hobby of locking up and executing their own people who disagree with their rule.<br />We may not be saints, but they're no angels either...
B00006F7S4|1.0|Oh my God what an awful album! Not a single tune that is a bit exciting. Wheres the melody? It all blend together in a haze of monotony. I have no idea if Beck is trying to be the clearly more talented Ryan Adams or not on this release. Anyway, its just a painful experience listening to this rubbish. The only use youll have of Becks Sea change is as a torture tool.

0486211045|5.0|Lemme tell you something right now. This is one sweet little book! It gets two stars right off the bat because it's really cheap(unlike Hogarth). For a student who doesn't have an income, this really helps out. When I bought this this book, I thought I knew a little about human anatomy. Well, put it this way, I was wrong! This book is PACKED with anatomy! Thanks to it, I've been getting alot better. Now I'm starting to do a real study of this book, and I don't think I'll be disappointed.
B0000027RL|5.0|I always considered Vitology Pearl Jam's Best just because of it is so unique and genious, but if it wasn't for Ten, I wouldn't even like Pearl Jam.<br />Ten is really one of the best rock albums of all time, even better than my favorite PJ album, Vitology.  As is repeatedly mentioned this album was part of the trilogy that started the grunge movement along with Nirvana and Soundgarden.  I think what sets Pearl Jam apart is its accessibility.  I know many think it is a drawback, and I would agree when looking at Vs, but Ten is a masterpiece that is easily comparible to Nevermind by Nirvana. Anyone that listens to the lyrics to Jeremy or Evenflow see that these are not &quot;pop&quot; songs.  But they hit an emotional chord that the best music is always recognized for just like Nirvana did with &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.<br />Ten just doesn't stop at the songs that it is known for, songs like Release, Why Go, and Garden are also masterpieces.  This is really a solid album, and if you can own only one Pearl Jam album I would make this the one, even considering my own preference for Vitology as mentioned before.
B00007G1ZC|3.0|Ok, the box reports &quot;Anamorphic Widescreen&quot;... But the screen aspect - which hadn't been respected already on LaserDisc edition - has been even more trimmed down in the DVD edition. The DVD aspect ratio is only 1.8:1, while when released on screen the aspect ratio was 2.35:1!<br />I already checked out if they used the entire frame of the Super 35mm original and it was not the case, as the DVD has fewer image details and lateral image compared to the LaserDisc edition. Alas!<br />The sound is very good but comparable to the LaserDisc edition.<br />Finally, the DVD has no extras at all - something disappointing, as Kurosawa declared at the time of theatrical release that the special effects available at the time were used to their maximum extent. And that he wouldn't commit other three of his dreams to the screen because there were no sufficient SFX at the time to allow this.<br />A rather disappointing release. At least, the movie is beautiful, but I'll stick with the LaserDisc edition.
B000001F76|5.0|So many singers have recorded HANK WILLIAMS's songs after his death,that it is natural to get at least this two cds set that gives you most of the meat of his oeuvre.What distinguish WILLIAMS from others country stars of his generation is his naturelness that stands as authentic.There's a tendancy for people who are not fond of this kind of music to dismiss it ,like for instance professionnal wrestling because it's seems a fake.There's nothing quite like listening to songs like I'M SO LONESONE,I COULD CRY,HEY GOOD LOOKIN'(the original is still the best version)or JAMBALAYA.In fact,it simply definies the meaning of the word popular in a non selfish way.Getting down to bussinness,don't you think that BILL HALEY should have give royalties for using the music of MOVE IT ON OVER for ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK?Fifty years have gone by since HANK WILLIAMS's death,and while others have passed before and after,he can still be proud for being the guy who put country music on the map.

B00000F14B|5.0|Professor Harold Hill makes his living conning small town residence by telling them he's going to start a boys' band then leaving with their money before the promised direction begins.  Taking an unintended challenge, he gets off in River City, Iowa.  While the locals at first appear cold, his charm soon changes their minds.  Or almost all of them.  Marion, the local librarian and piano teacher, is convenienced that the professor isn't all he claims to be.  Meanwhile, Harold has set his sites on wooing the spinster librarian.  Will he win her heart or hurt her?  Will the townspeople find out the truth, or will this encounter change everyone for the better?<br />As much as I love musicals, I had missed this one until the recent ABC movie version.  I fell immediately under its charming spell.  The story is fun and the music is fantastic.  After enjoying the remake so much, I was looking forward to watching the original, and it didn't disappointment.  The cast, lead by Robert Preston and Shirley Jones, is strong.  The chorography makes me want to join in the fun (always a must for a musical), and the story fleshes out a couple minor points I had missed in the remake.  And I simply must praise the work of the Buffalo Bills as the school board.  They've inspired me in my search for good barbershop quartet music.<br />The DVD preserves the movie well.  The widescreen picture is sharp and clear and the sound is just fine.  Watching the trailer for the reissue shows just how much work has gone into the restoration.  Shirley Jones provides an interesting intro and serves as host for the behind the scenes special.<br />This is a classic musical that everyone will enjoy.  It tells a fun story with wonderful music and evokes a simpler time and place.  If you haven't watched yet, pick up a copy and enjoy tonight.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Forget Don Juan DeMarco, forget Sleepy Hollow, forget any other Johnny Depp film (except Cry Baby *drool*). This is THE Johnny Depp film. You have to see it. It's Johnny Depp at his best. I've had this film recorded from the TV for ages, and typical, my tape ran out, and I missed only the last 15 minutes (and what a disappointment they were!)<br />Johnny Depp plays the loveable Sam, who's cheese seems to have come off his cracker. His whole character, moves, voice, and his funny comedic moments are a total take-off of Charlie Chaplin & all those actors from the \\"good old days\\". He is taken in by Benny & Joon. The lovely Aidan Quinn plays Benny, looking after his sister, Joon, played by Mary Stuart Masterson (who I still say was in Little House On The Prarie, but no one believes me!). Joon is \\"mentally ill\\" or \\"sick\\" - the film never actually says what's wrong with her. I think she's either autistic or schizophrenic - sorry if that's wrong, or she's not one or the other, but I always get them muddled up! She lives to a routine (that makes me think autistic), but she switches personalities (schizophrenic?). I love watching this little routine, watching her make breakfast, or the way she goes to sleep at night, or the way she paints - she gets more of it on her than she does on the canvas! Enter Benny. Who she instantly falls in love with. The music behind the love scene is brilliant, and well played by Johnny & Mary.<br />There's a few classic moments in this film - mainly thanks to Johnny Depp. Just wait til you see him do his whole performance in the park, or his little dance with the bread in the restaurant. Or making a toasted cheese sandwich by ironing it, and making mashed potatoes by hitting them with a tennis racket. If that doesn't make you want to see this film, nothing will. And the classic line? \\"Raisins are just humiliated grapes\\". I love this film. It doesn't show much about the mentally ill, and at the end, there's too many things left in the open. Like what happens to Benny & the woman he fancies, Ruthie (played by Julianne Moore)? We see Joon getting her own apartment, but how is it decorated? Are there paintings everywhere? And does Sam move in with her? All will be discovered in the sequel ... I wish.<br />Bring on the soundtrack!what happens to Benny & the woman he fancies, Ruthie (played by Julianne Moore)?

B0000019PA|5.0|I bought this solely on the review .... All I can say is thank you. I rarely buy music based on favorite bands or what I've heard on the radio (... I don't even listen to the radio)which is waht makes buying cd's, at least for me, such a surprising experience. I'm never quite sure what that disc I'm popping into my cd player is going to deliver. In rare instances am I ever disappointed in the music I purchase. Rarer still am I ever blown away. Springsteen's \\"Nebraska\\", Lou Reed's \\"New York\\", Matthew Sweet's \\"Girlfriend\\" are just a few that have done that over the many years. NMH's ...Aeroplane Over the Sea is in this category. It blew me away from the first listen. I've heard it categorized as a concept album, and though categorization bothers me, I'd have to agree. However, I also believe that many of these songs stand on their own as seperate, isolated gems. This is a great album. Period. Nothing left to say.
0553573403|5.0|Martin begins this series with great characterization and realism. He includes enough magic to catagorize this as &quot;fantasy&quot;, but doesn't coddle the characters. Don't grow too attached to them, because just as in reality, heroes can be killed. Don't expect to get a lot of sleep until you finish this one.
B000065U1N|5.0|While I found the film extremely well made from a technical perspective, it was hardly uplifting in any sense, patriotic or otherwise.  I came away with the impression that the Rangers killed a lot of nameless, faceless Somalis (nicknamed skinnies by the GIs) during their raid on Mogadishu.   When attacked, the people of Aidid's clan, men, women, and children, fought back ferociously in what I now believe was self defense.  Regrettably, the Rangers were put in a position, by their leadership both in-country and at the Pentagon, in which they killed indiscrimately in order to survive.  I didn't get the impression that the film makers placed any value whatsoever on the lives of 1,000-2,000 the Somalis killed in battle, many of whom were no doubt simply bystanders, preferring to focus on the Rangers' deadly struggle to extricate themselves from the debacle.    <br />We Americans tend to leave a lot dead civilians in the wake of our &quot;civilizing missions&quot; around the world, and Black Hawk Down illustrates this vividly.  This should give us pause.  Viewing this film definitely changed my perspective and mind about  nation building by force of American arms, and in that respect it was invaluable and I gave it 5 stars.
B00005R87Q|1.0|Once upon a time, somewhere in Hollywood, someone said, \\"Hey, lets [mimic] Point Break, make it brainless and unwatchable, and it will become a box office SMASH!\\" Naturally, he was immediately rushed to the funny farm and never heard from again. Oh, no, wait a minute, this is Hollywood! They went through with it and it made millions.<br />The only thing that kept me awake throughout this \\"movie\\" was the loud DVD sound. (By the way, I'm 16, so don't think I'm some stiff old professor type) The plot? There was none. Unless the stupid street racing thing was supposed to be a plot. Sadly, I think it was...<br />Anyway, if you crave a movie with a plot and at least halfway-decent acting, stay far away.<br />Okay, you can click \\"not helpful\\" now...
B000084T18|5.0|This is not the greatest rap Cd ever, however, this is a very good Cd. Dre and Eminem producing the beats for the Cd means the beats are great. But 50's lyrics are also pretty damn good. My favourite songs are &quot;In Da Club&quot;, &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot; and &quot;Back Down&quot;. <BR>&quot;In Da Club&quot; is a great song to party to or to listen to while you are in a club. The chorus is catchy and the beat is very catchy. &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot; is a great song which features Eminem. Lyrics are great especially from Em. and the beat is somewhat darker than some of the others. &quot;Back Down&quot; has a dark beat, catchy chorus and some good gangsta lyrics. I would say that this is 50's breakthrough album and i'd say we can expect more from him in the future.
B00005JLMH|3.0|I watched this movie for school because we are currently studying Columbus. Columbus' voyage to the New World is probably one of the biggest event in history. What is disappointing, however, is that most people don't know what really happened and Columbus' role in the harsh treatment of the Indians. People are hidden by the fact that Columbus' was really a violent man who was driven by his greed for gold. Sure, Columbus is a very prominent character in history since he did commit most of his time to this voyage. The film was filled with great action sequences and graphics. Its' scenery was also very interesting and beautiful. The music adds a lot to the tone of the movie. The acting was also very good especially by the villian, Michael Wincott, who was very menacing and evil. The actor who portrayed Columbus (don't know his name) was also very good. The film also did a good job of showing the events as it truly was with the massacre of the spaniards, the sacrifice of the natives and also the tribute system which resulted in many natives having their hand cut off because they didn't bring enough gold. Even though they had all the historical events down, the major flaw was in Columbus' character. If one does not know much about Columbus and what he did, we would have commended him even more and sympathize for him even more. The movie showed Columbus has being heavily pressured in whatever he did by the Spaniards which really didn't happen. Most of the things that happened were thought of by Columbus. It also showed how moral he was towards the Indian, not wanting to revenge against them, which also didn't really happen. It also didn't show much of Columbus' greed for gold which was the big reason for all his doings. When most of the people are not aware of what Columbus did, this film was suppose to portray it but the film did not address the issue accurately. It was a good film with its' many action sequences. This was supposed to be an 'epic' but the inaccuracy of its' title character, the most prominent man in history, makes us wonder if this truly is a great movie. Ridley Scott is probably considered one of the best directors with many 'epic' pictures such as Gladiator and Black Hawk Down which were supposed to be on historical events but both those movie, also don't remain that accurate. Hopefully in the near future, there can be a movie on Columbus' that truly shows the ugliness that his attempt to try to civilize the Indian really was. If I wasn't aware of what happened in history, I think I'll also enjoy this movie, but I really can't ignore history. That is probably why I gave it three stars.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is what old &quot;System&quot; sounds like. Granted I did like &quot;Toxicity&quot;, but it wasn't the old &quot;System&quot; that I knew. If you've only heard &quot;Toxicity&quot; you definitly want to check out the old crazy music they were known for. This album is full of nothing but their old style of fast and crazy music that sounds like nothing else. New System of a Down fans may not like it at first, but give a couple listens and you'll be glad you did.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Honestly, the best movie I've seen in a long, long time.<br />It seems (after reading alot of the reviews) that this movie has its fans and its not fans. That its movement in telling its tale baffles and enrages some, and inspires others pretty much carries the hallmark of a great film. Films should do that, not just have you leaving the theatre or screen saying 'That was garbage and I can't even bother saying why'.<br />Maybe it hits a certain relevance with me. After living in Los Angeles and the Hollywood area for a little while, I'd swear to you that such a creature exists lurking behind a Winkies Restaurant. For all those that feel Harlem or New York City is a fearful place to be, I can tell you in all-truth that Hollywood at night is a far far worse place to be, where all those truly on the deranged side figured out that staying warm was a far smarter thing to do. And that the Illusion Factory that is Hollywood snares so many, and you can see the wasteland of it on its streets, just makes Mulholland Drive a powerful statement regarding illusions. I do not feel necessarily pessimistic in my attitude towards Hollywood or that part of California, but I know that being in it gives you an understanding of the un-reality which is that part of the world. It made Mulholland Drive for me, a reminder of things I saw in Los Angeles that seemed unbelieveable, but accepted as fact and something to strive for. And no, I did not go out to Los Angeles seeking fame, fortune and glory. I just like moving and changing the scenery.<br />I was not at all confused by Lynch's story. I knew it was important to watch everything taking place, to miss one reference would mean its relevance later on would not be as impacting. I knew enough to know that all would eventually reach to some 'thing' or conclusion, and I surely was not disappointed by its ending at all. By THE END I realised I had watched a great piece of filmmaking, probably the best since 1995's The Usual Suspects. Mulholland Drive is suspenseful, intriguing, confusing and puts the viewer in a state of displacement.<br />I mean, maybe it is just me. But I know alot of people who go out to California thinking alot like 'Betty/Diane' does, that everything is going to be wonderful, no matter what comes. Honestly, that does happen. And as many young hotshot directors as there are, to think that organised crime does not play apart in the industry, and can dictate how your movie will be, should be made would be naive. But thats not all of Lynch's point. Betty's delusional portion of the movie only serves as a 'pointed finger' at elements of corruption within the system, and the people participating. The movie works not only as a cautionary tale, but also as an expose. It actually works on so many more levels than this I can't really even begin to thoroughly go through it point by point.<br />Lynch produced probably his best work since Blue Velvet for me with this film. I honestly do see what has enraged some about the film, and on the other hand take those views with a slight pinch of salt, knowing that Lynch made some incredible observations about the American Dream, Hollywood, the human psyche and the vast majority of their pitfalls. Beneath the layers of confusion is a true tale of honesty that does not require a pessimistic mind to see its value or worth, nor an optimistic one's constant re-approval that all is well despite. Balance is the key.nd Drive is suspenseful, intriguing, confusing and puts the viewer in a state of displacement.<br />I mean, maybe it is just me.

B000021YQV|4.0|When this record first came out I was worried it would be too commercial, but its not. Don't listen to the hype. This album never gets old, no one else out there can do what &quot;System&quot; does. They are one of the most original bands, doing your own thing can be hard. With the radio full of bands that sound the same, SOAD is the one different band. Other than the radio over played &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; the rest of the album is great. If I could give it a 4.5 it would.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|The stronger story in this moralistic tale of addiction, is the tale of Ellen Burstyn's character. By far, that was the basis of a great piece of filmmaking. The exploration of over-the-counter / prescription drugs, television, weight loss, hyped up marketing ploys was the film that should have been made and thoroughly delved into. Burstyn is a wonderful actor and a film made with that character for 90 minutes, making as many pointed accusations it could about an industry of addiction in denial would have made a powerful film. That was the movie I wanted to see, but that was not what was on offer here.<br />The quick MTV style edits work in the context of Burstyn's segments, but in the long run, the story overall could tell her tale far far better than trickery and sped up montages. This just wasn't done.<br />And as far as the 'youth in trouble' portions of the film, I really was not buying it. As the main character 'shoots up' into the same vein which is now swollen, gaping and oozing, totally remiss of the fact that he has another vein JUST like it on his other arm, was kind of funny. This device was just primarily used to frighten the unaware. Anyone who was/is an addict would look at this character and say, what an [goof]! Now, if he had been using heroin for 10 or 20 years, and every viable entry vein on his body had been thoroughly collapsed, THEN I'd believe it. Regardless of the addiction, heroin users aren't THAT stupid. Insuring you get the next 'hit' relies on you maintaining a reliable 'hitpoint'. Really did not buy that, ruined the whole point of the movie. Went for shock when it didn't need to. Came across like a 1930's drug warning exploitation film, but in colour. After that, the movie just falls apart.<br />Its an interesting watch, and surely worth it for Burstyn's performance throughout, but it honestly works better as a film you'd show to students to scare them off drugs, OR film students interested in editing techniques. I know the people worked hard on the project, I know they put their efforts in to it, but there was a better movie in here with just Burstyn carrying it. And a more believeable plot would help carry a more believeable message. That addiction of all kinds afflicts each and every one of us, admitting it helps.ed hard on the project, I know they put their efforts in to it, but there was a better movie in here with just Burstyn carrying it.

B00008977N|2.0|I was so excited to have this concert come out on dvd.  Peter Gabriel is so talented, and this concert is blow-away amazing.  Imagine how my heart stopped when I saw the very poor video transfer on this Universal Music dvd.  It is in widescreen, but the techs fell asleep on the transfer.  My original laserdisc looks 20 times better (thank God I didn't sell it!).  Much of the video content appears blurry and there is little detail.  I know it is not the camera guy's fault, because the laserdisc version looks clean and detailed (this concert is high-quality all the way).  The dvd really looks that bad, and I blame Universal Music.   The sound gets five stars, and the extras are very nice, when most concert dvd's lack any.  The 'making of' and the preview of the Growing Up tour are great.  Get this dvd for the extras and the sound, not for the video.  Why did Universal drop the ball on one of my all-time favorite concerts?  I feel sick when I watch this dvd version...I'm glad I kept the laserdisc!
B00005YUNY|3.0|First the positive:<br />YES music works incredibly well with an orchestra. I feel the arrangements were interesting and paid attention to as many elements of the 5-piece instrumentation that is YES music as a whole. In particular to Squire's bass lines, which I find time and time again to have the most orchestral qualities in YES music. When the orchestra duplicated his bass lines on certain songs, it seemed that was the way it was always meant to be heard.<br />Anderson's vocals are really as good as they ever were, and I liked the fact that less FX were used. Often in the past he has had tons and tons of FX on his voice and it in no way augments YES's repertoire, it buries it. Symphonic gives you Anderson's voice pretty clear and un-effected.<br />Chris Squire &amp; Alan White still prove to be the strength of YES throughout all its line-ups. Their energy and enthusiasm keeps this disc from slipping into the<br />NEGATIVE<br />which is Howe's performance throughout. Not in his execution and playing, but in his schoolteacher, you are the student attitude that prevails throughout the performance. At one point, Squire comes over during Gates of Delirium to Howe, and as they are playing the same notes, looks to him for some sort of interaction. Howe looks at him like he's asking him for money, or doesn't understand if there's something wrong with the other side of the stage where Squire's just arrived from. I found this off-putting and distracting from one of the best performances on the DVD which is Gates of Delirium. Another reviewer has commented about Howe's guitar sound, and I have to agree. It has lost alot of its bite and drive and the parts now suffer from lack of energy but not execution. Howe is still a wonderful player, but I honestly do not 'feel' anything from him in this concert.<br />Its the major weak point in an otherwise really good concert. The three songs from MAGNIFICATION I found to be the other weakness. I know alot of YES fans have said that this is their best work in a long time, and maybe YES decided to play the three most uninteresting songs from the actual album, I cannot tell having never bought it. I just re-listened to them again a few days ago to see if my opinion had changed. I understand YES's insistence on returning to longer pieces, concerning IN The Presence Of, but since 96's Keys to Ascension, I just find these longer pieces don't have enough going on in them to justify being 10 minutes or longer. Not the case in older Yes material that far exceeded the 10 minute length. They just kind of drift on one theme and then move to a completely different theme for another 4 minutes without any sort of inventiveness that used to be there in their work. Still, Squire &amp; White carry the energy required to get through those pieces, and the orchestra seemed to like the songs. They just did nothing for me. Yes since 1996 have left me wishing they would go forward instead of backwards.<br />Recorded very well and much better than Keys To Ascension, an orchestra added to their music is something to see and enjoy, particularly on the material where it can really be shown how intricate and special YES music was at a certain time. Despite the negatives I've brought up, I would recommend it over the other live performances released by Yes the past few years.this is their best work in a long time, and maybe YES decided to play the three most uninteresting songs from the actual album, I cannot tell having never bought it.

B00007AJGH|5.0|This film was released in 1988, and told the story of adorable and whacky cartoon characters spilling over into the \\"real\\" world as studio contract players.  It's basically a buddy cop noir detective story between a hard boiled detective (Bob Hoskins) and a fuzzy white animated rabbit he is helping.  Amazingly enough NO CGI was used at all - 840,000 hand painted cells were overlaid onto live action!  It's amazingly real, and hasn't really been topped before or since.<br />Previously ROGER RABBIT was released as a bare bones single DVD without any extras, bells or whistles.  Buena Vista corrects this oversight with a stunning loaded new package which contains two DVDS.<br />The first is labeled the \\"Family Friendly\\" version, and contains the pan and scan version of the film and a kid friendly documentary about the movie.  Also included are three cartoon shorts featuring Roger and Baby Herman previously only seen in theatres.  There is a rather remote intensive game included as well that should keep youngsters entertained, but not quite up to their Playstation standards.<br />The second disc is for ENTHUSIASTS, and contains more in-depth technical information and the widescreen version of the film.  Commentary and pop up factoids round out this disc for all of us DVD lovers who like these features.<br />It is well worth the investment!  Stunning presentation in a handsome package, and whimsical menus that reflect the movie.  I love it!  :-)
B000002KD5|5.0|With the addition of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, Fleetwood Mac headed to the studio to cut the 11-track album that would become the most successful album of the 1975, yield three Top-Twenty singles, and launch a successful American tour that would last well into 1976. With three singer-songwriters, the band now had three distinct voices as well as personalities. Lindsey Buckingham contributed his producing skills, as well as his bittersweet edge on songs like &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot; and &quot;Monday Morning&quot;. Stevie Nicks, the witchy, carasmatic songstress added her love of fairytales and personal darkness to songs like &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Landslide&quot;. Finally, the distinct, honey-voiced Christine McVie defined the easy-listening vibe of the new lineup with songs like &quot;Over My Head&quot;, &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, and &quot;Warm Ways&quot;. Every song on the album defines the carefree era of the mid-70s. Fleetwood Mac's debut album reflects songs of fear, enchantment, and love. This is definetly something worth adding to one's music collection. Also recommended, Fleetwood Mac's 1977 smash &quot;Rumours&quot;.
B00006690G|5.0|Marshall Mathers has certainly proved that he is more than just a white-boy-tryina-be-black rapper.  His lyrics are undeniably well-thought out, articulate, emotionally charged, and just plain genius.  He touches on topics that many rappers dare not come close to, such as his family and the depression that claws in the corners of his mind.  \\"The Eminem Show\\" offers us a window into the inner workings of Em's heart and soul.  The best thing about this album is that it truly IS Marshall Mathers--he doesn't act, he doesn't front, he doesn't try to conceal any aspect of his personality.  Just sit down and read the lyrics--there are underlying ideas and amazing observations in his songs that a person will never pick up on while listening to the record.  The words he writes with and his clever antics reveal that Mr. Mathers is a very intelligent, knowledgable man.  People who despise him because of his opinions or frequent use of profanity don't know him, and don't take the time to know him either.<br />Top 5 Tracks:<BR>1.  Say What You Say<BR>2.

B000089RVX|5.0|I love the way this band sounds. Amy Lee is awesome. Her vocals will blow you away. There is not one song of the band's that I do not enjoy. they are all unique and very upbeat. I would say that they are on the way to the top. This is a must buy CD.
0780622553|5.0|The trailers for Dark City suggested a film so complex and impeneterable to leave the viewer rather confused at its conclusion, yet in execution the film makes far more sense than the intriguing montage in the trailer.<br />Set in a dark world--literally dark, as no one seems to remember being out during the day--the film focuses on John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), a man who awakens amnesiac to find a murdered woman nearby.  Soon thereafter pursued by the police (led by William Hurt), he must solve the mystery of his missing memories and eerie pursuers.<br />Helped along the way by a woman claiming to be his wife (Jennifer Connelley) and a pendactic psychiatrist (Kiefer Sutherland), Murdoch learns that his pursuers are a race of aliens with the power to warp reality with their minds who continually change the city and the memories and even lives of the people inhabiting it in an experiment designed to save their lives.  Murdoch has developed their same power to &quot;tune&quot; and save humanity from the aliens' machinations.<br />The film's theme of questionable reality--carried across on two levels as both human memories are manipulated and the physical world itself changed on a nightly basis--is done fairly well if somewhat less successfully than the in the Matrix.<br />Replete with dark imagery suiting the film noir genre and quite at home in Blade Runner, the movie makes for a stunning visual performance.  The aliens are masterfully done as frightening and eerie outsiders.  My only complaint is that I was able to grasp the film's actions and meanings on a first viewing with little difficulty; I had expected to come out with the sense of, &quot;What the heck?!&quot; that would require two or three viewings to fully digest the film's depth.  Yet that aside, the film is still a definite watch for any fans of film noir or reality-questioning sci-fi.<br />The DVD includes a number of special features to sweeten the deal, including two commentary tracks, the theatrical trailer (whose music unfortunately didn't make it into the film), an isolated score track, and more.

B000003S0F|4.0|The fourth release in two years proved to be a mellow break from the usually tight and frantic King Crimson heard previously. This is due mostly to a strong change of band personnel and the lyrics of Pete Sinfield. Many of the songs rely more on said lyrics than before and there is more of a jazz influence, accentuated by frequent use of a saxaphone.<br />The first two songs are a mix of or a collage of, songs crafted around a simple beat. Mixing a high vocal solo with saxaphone, the second song skips along until it breaks into a faster paced saxaphone laced race. Note that Fripp uses an 'out-of-tune' guitar to produce just one of his most unique sounds. \\"The Letters\\" and \\"Ladies Of The Road\\" rely more on shocking and salacious lyrics that can produce an adolescent giggle.<br /><br />\\"Prelude: Songs Of The Gulls\\" is a curious break from form and is simply a quartet of violins and cellos for a completely subdued prelude to \\"Islands\\". This last song is one of King Crimson's most beautiful compositions and builds slowly with thoughtful lyrics and a solo cornet that accompanies a playful piano. It's so contemplative that you'll find yourself meditating into a peaceful trance.<br /><br />This is not classic King Crimson, but an attestment to their striking ability to play anything they want extremely well.
B000002J1U|4.0|The third release from Page and Co. takes a bit of a turn from the hard rock/blues format of the first two recordings.<br />Perhaps not quite as hit heavy as II, IV (Zoso, Runes, whatever) or Houses of the Holy, this is still a strong disk, with solid band performances and Robert Plant singing with more and more confidence. I consider this to be one of Led Zeppelin's more organic efforts, full of acoustic guitar driven songs, but there's plenty of electricity here to balance things out.<br />&quot;Immigrant Song&quot; leads things off with a propulsive rhythm and beat, some terrific wailing by Plant and lyrics based on Norse mythos that mention Thor, Valhalla, etc. Great Viking imagery and some tricky stop/start changes.<br />&quot;Friends&quot; picks up a nice strummy groove with unusual chords and an orchestral string track.<br />&quot;Celebration Day&quot; gets back to some electric zip, with a nifty little riff.<br />&quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is a cool blues tune, but seems out of place here, more like a leftover from the 1st album.<br />&quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; has another memorable riff that guitarists cut their teeth on.<br />&quot;Gallows Pole&quot; shifts back to the acoustic mode with a new arrangement of a traditional folk song that has an old American west feel, with mandolins and banjos and knee-slapping beat. Nice basswork by Jones hidden in here too. &quot;Hangman, hangman...&quot;<br />&quot;Tangerine&quot; has a false start, then moves into a pretty acoustic strum, with chord arpeggios, and lyrics of yearning and loss. This song also has a western feel, with lap steel guitars. I like this song, but the harmonies have always sounded a bit off to me.<br />&quot;That's The Way&quot; is one of LZ's all-time underrated tunes, a moving, introspective song about coming of age and leaving old friends behind. Nice acoustic strumming, atmospheric pedal steel guitars, and emotional vocal performance by Plant. I also like the instrumental refrain at the end.<br />&quot;Bron-y-aur Stomp&quot; features some nice acoustic picking, and picks up that western twang with more thigh-slapping fun.<br />&quot;Hats Off to (Roy) Harper&quot; always led to the question, 'Who is Roy Harper, anyway?' See Pink Floyd's 'Have a Cigar' for more on Harper. This song has Plant trying to do that Delta blues inflection, but the repetitive acoustic sliding gets a little annoying. A quirky tune, but not one of my favorites.<br />If you don't have this disk already, I recommend it for collecting some nuggets that you might not be familiar with. If you had the old LP album, don't expect the psychedelic spin wheel with the gate fold, but you'll still get the pictures.at the end.<br />&quot;Bron-y-aur Stomp&quot; features some nice acoustic picking, and picks up that western twang with more thigh-slapping fun.<br />&quot;Hats Off to (Roy) Harper&quot; always led to the question, 'Who is Roy Harper, anyway?'

B000003S09|5.0|Released in 1969 with lyricist Peter Sinfield, Greg Lake (of the later ELP) and maniacal genius Robert Fripp (King Crimson himself), this album still catches the ear of any progressive musician or fan.  This is the band that took a mellotron and pushed it over the top, producing some of the most endorphin inducing and hallucinatory musical experiences to date.<br /><br />\\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" is the most well known, with it's fatalistic lyrics, violent guitars and harsh, scratchy vocals.  It achieves it purpose.  Right on it's heels is the lovely, \\"I Talk To The Wind\\", a Greg Lake vocal that is fanciful, dreamy and beautiful.  Sullen and heartbreaking is the best way I can describe \\"Epitaph\\", a mature contemplative look at one's own mortality and confusion.  Backed with a gentle death march beat and a soaring mellotron that pulls at your emotions like no other song on this album.  It's amazing.<br /><br />\\"Moonchild\\" is a whimsical, unique endeavor that makes for a nice break before the grand finale of \\"The Court Of The Crimson King\\".  Breaking straight into a strong drum arrangement and shatteringly intense mellotron, the last song bridges back and forth from the 12-string guitar with choice vocals to the literaly killer chorus.  This is where the talents of King Crimson truly take off.  With a driving drum and bass, a relentless keyboard and an unforgettable chorus, King Crimson jumps around with flute solos, ambitious guitar plucking and inventive soft percussion.  It's the reprise that pulls it all together.  The experience of this debut album is exhilirating, breathtaking and to this date - still hair-raisingly unique.
0312305060|5.0|This is a marvelous book! Cunningham's writing is amazing. You begin it with Virginia Woolf's death, coming off very strong. It shows the real meaning of life, and you start to question everything about your life. I may not be able to say much, there are way too many words TO say. Just wow. One of the books you need to buy.
B000005HN6|3.0|Some bands release a strong debut and then promptly proceed downhill, while others get better as they along.  I think it's safe to say that Opeth fall into the latter category.  While \\"Orchid\\" does show the seeds of the greatness that would later be demonstrated on such classics as \\"My Arms Your Hearse\\" and \\"Deliverance,\\" Opeth weren't quite there yet.  Like many debuts, \\"Orchid\\" is plagued by weak production and unfocused songwriting.  As on most Opeth albums, many of the songs on this one are more than ten minutes long.  However, on \\"Orchid\\" they don't hold my attention as well as on, say, \\"Morningrise\\" or the brilliant \\"Deliverance.\\"  They just seem to meander too much.  The instrumental passages are very long, which wouldn't be a problem in and of itself, but they don't really go anywhere.  Nobody had really had a sound like Opeth's before, with its mix of extreme metal and neoclassical/progressive elements, and it sounds on \\"Orchid\\" like they weren't really sure what to do with it.  They had created something new, now they just had to put some more thought into it, which of course they did.  Another problem I had with this album was Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals.  I do think he's a great vocalist, but it wasn't too apparent here.  He tries really hard to roar and sound menacing...  It's just not working.  On later albums, of course, Opeth would make significant improvements, most notably tighter songwriting, better production, stronger vocals, and the addition of drum master Martin Lopez.  I don't want to sound like I'm completely downing this album, as there is a good deal of creativity and musicianship on display.  But if you want great Opeth, don't start with this album.  My personal favorites are their two heaviest, \\"My Arms Your Hearse\\" and \\"Deliverance,\\" but any of the last five will do.
B00008HCCF|3.0|Pre-dating the massive success of her excellent album, Norah seems lacking in confidence. Her phrasing is slurred, and her manner often seems anxious and uncertain. It is not a great performance - cf Krall's recent DVD of her Paris show. None of the songs from the CD are bettered live.  However Norah is a major 'new' talent, and the DVD shows her in a small concert setting that her deserved success will now preclude. Its best seen as an interesting document of her early career. If that's how you approach it you wont be disappointed. But if you don't have the CD get it instead. I don't know what control Norah had over the release of this DVD, but let's hope she is given the space and time to develop without pressure to release 'product'.
B000084T18|5.0|50's hottest album to date.  50 Cent has broken the Billbaord record of selling the most albums of a debut album in one week.  Since then the CD has sold millions.  This CD is really good listening with the hit \\"Wanksta,\\" \\"Many Men,\\" a song about people hatin on 50, \\"Back Down,\\" a song dissing rap superstar Ja Rule and his Murder Inc. family and the C.E.O. of Death Row Records, Suge Knight, and the new club single, \\"In Da Club.\\"  The CD is mainly produced by Eminem and Dr. Dre and other songs feature such artists as Eminem, Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks, and Young Buc from 50's group, G Unit.  50's softer side is also shown in the radio hit, \\"21 Questions,\\" featuring Nate Dogg.  This CD is really one worth buying, hands down.
B00003CXAQ|2.0|One scene in TOD in particular drives me crazy every time I watch this movie.  Remember when Indy, Short Round, and Willie are riding along in the rickety mining car over vast crevasses in the Temple?  Remember how deep those ravines were?  Okay, now fast forward to the next scene, where a giant bucket of water is dumped down the tunnel.  It is a big bucket, don't get me wrong, but anyone who has studied physics and spatial relations knows that the water would fill in the cracks first and there is NO WAY that the amount of water (which was much smaller than the volume of the main area of the temple which in turn is much smaller than the volume of the mining ravine) would 1. fill in all of the ravine, 2. explode with enough force to travel laterally over the ravine, or 3. come through with so much force that the water would break through the rock wall.  A couple simple changes would have made the whole thing a little more plausible: instead of a bucket, why couldn't it have been a dammed river? (And yes, I am speaking of a DAMMED river, not the vernacular).  If the dam were to burst, I would still have some objections to its plausibility but I would at least have enough to willingly suspend disbelief.  Another thing.  Indy's biggest problem would not have been rushing water, it would have been the incredible amount of STEAM!!! Remember the swirling lava at the bottom of the ravine?  But of course, steam makes make-up run and hairspray fall, so Willie couldn't have a steam bath on the side of the cliff, now could she?  It wouldn't have looked good in the previews.<br />By no means is that the only scene that makes me scratch my head.  The whole thing seems rather Western-centric... It seems like the message of the movie is this: \\"Look at those crazy brown people worshipping rocks!  Look at the disgusting things they eat!  Look at how they drink blood and rip out people's hearts... Now, hurray!  The white came and freed the savages' children... Now everybody is happy!  Isn't the white man swell?\\"  I'm sure that wasn't the film makers' intent but still...<br />All that said, I didn't hate the movie.  It has some major flaws and is by far the weakest of the three.  It seemed like it was trying too hard to out-do the original... more gross, more action, more danger, etc. and it turned out to be much much less.Isn't the white man swell?\\"  I'm sure that wasn't the film makers' intent but still...<br />All that said, I didn't hate the movie.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|I get new images each time I watch this movie. The way this Requiem for a dream was pulled together is beautiful, the alltered views in each scene made for a more exciting time, the story line scared me. I am not sure if this was ment to be a scary movie but it shows you a life not worth living. I believe the creaters of this movie many more amazing films to come, Keep up the amazing work.

0345440900|4.0|This book helped me so much! By the time my daughter was 6 weeks old I knew things had to change. She wouldn't let us put her down and couldn't sleep without us, freaked out when we put her in a bassinette and forget the crib. She would nap only when 'attached' to her parents - either sleeping on a chest or lap - or grandpa's big belly.  I had to go back to work and needed help. This book was the answer.  The information it contains helped me understand that problem #1 was that baby was overtired and couldn't help but cry.  Problem #2 was that her parents were enabling bad outcomes, by constantly holding her - that's all she knew and she liked it.  Well, after reading and  2 difficult days and nights of putting her in her crib and picking her up each time she freaked out she finally got the idea and mom and dad got their hands free! She has slept in her crib ever since. I understand my daughter's crys better and realize when she is tired or over stimulated, etc. - I don't think I would have ever gotten it without this book. Now, of course there are some things she suggests that I've tweeked for my purposes, but Tracy's approach is very humane and the time I spend with my girl now is so much more pleasant and less stressed. I have to thank God for leading me to this book - it was an answer to prayer. We are enjoying raising a happy and healthy child, I really don't know what I would have done without this book!
0440180295|2.0|Kurt Vonnegut is not a writer.  He is someone who was able, through his contacts with governmental money provided to academics in the 30s, to foist is sloppy, humourous(lacking actual literary ability) cheaply and dishonorably written work upon us.  As a student I was forced to read this monster.  His books are not writing, they are pure tom foolary.  This book, lauded to be the capstone, the beggining for an exploration of his touted literary genious, is actually probably only useful as toilet paper.<br />So it goes... Kurt Vonnegut uses this disgustingly cheap segway to work himself out of every situation.  His book wastes pages and pages of precious ink talking about aliens and splicing in images of WWII.<br />Its pure trash.  Up their with Michal Moores \\"stupid White men\\".
B00000ILBK|5.0|Who knew that there was so much humor and genuine affection between the mainstays of the Next Generation cast?  (Everyone who watched it, probably, except you had to really pay attention.)  This selection is a refreshingly \\"freed\\" and less stoic group of characters who are less worried about making a mistake and more worried about doing the right thing against the odds.<br />It's a good story, a wonderful showcase for the characters, including a wonderful flirtatious affair for the Captain, and a moral victory.  We get to root for the good guys and watch the bad guys either see the error of their ways or get incinerated.<br />Good fun overall.  You'll want to watch it more than once and keep it handy for when every show on TV is \\"reality.\\"  Given the choice, I'll opt for Star Trek every time.
B00005AFMT|5.0|King Crimson disbanded in 1974 after founding member and lead guitarist Robert Fripp thought it was time to put the band to rest feeling they had no more to contribute. Flash forward seven years to 1981 and the band is miraculously resurrected.<BR>With a new lineup of Fripp, original Crimson and former Yes drummer, Bill Bruford, guitar wizard and songwriter Adrian Belew (Talking Heads, Frank Zappa) and legendary bass player Tony Levin round out one of Crimsons best lineups.<BR>The band originally called themselves Discipline but as time progressed and the more they played together Fripp decided that the band deserved the title of the King Crimson name.<BR>The first track on the disc is now a Crimson fan favorite &quot;Elephant Talk&quot;. Other memorable tracks are the Belew penned &quot;Frame by Frame&quot;, &quot;Matte Kudasai&quot; and &quot;Indiscipline&quot;.<BR>This cd gave the Crimson fans old and new, a preview of great things to come from this new refreshed lineup. Outstanding music from Fripp &amp; Co.

6305603847|5.0|Contrary to popular belief, The Wall (movie) is about the life of original Floyd guitarist/vocalist/lyrical mastermind Syd Barret. The movie stars &quot;Pink&quot;, the receding rock star, who is slipping into insanity and slowly losing control. This is a DIRECT reference to Syd Barret, who was diagnosed with schitzoprenia and was asked to leave Pink Floyd in 1969 because while performing he would either play a completly different song thean what was being played, would not play at all, or not even show up at the performances. after Syd left, they hired David Gilmoure to fill in for him. By the way, for those of you who still have an old turntable lying around, play the song on The Wall &quot;Empty Spaces&quot; backwards to reveal a hidden message. for those who don't, the message says &quot;congragulations! you have found the hidden messsage. please send your reply to 'Original Pink, Care of the funny farm, Lancaster.&quot; This is referring to Syd Barret.
B00005JLZL|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent.  Not only did Kate Winslet do an excellent job ridding herself of a sexy English accent, she did a great job placing herself into a contemporary movie, especially with all of her \\"period piece\\" films she has done (I absolutely love her, and any movie she does is wonderful).  She is a brilliant actress. <br />Also, Kevin Spacey did an excellent job as well (no surprise!).  Of the many reviews I have read about this one, not one person has bothered to mention Laura Linney!  She was fantastic as well! <br />...  <br />So, I would totally recommend this movie if you are in for a few twists.  I am not a stupid person, and I LOVE movies, but I didn't figure out the ending, as one reviewer stated, \\"45 minutes into the movie.\\"  My best friend, who has to be one of the biggest movie buffs I've ever met, didn't see it coming either.  Can someone please explain that as well?  Thank you!
0345448898|5.0|Philip Pullman has undertaken one of the most ambitious young adult series that I have ever read.  Along with being just a very creative adventure/fantasy story, Pullman addresses a huge variety of universal questions and themes.  God, religion, the origins of the universe, war.  He has the nerve to call the church in his world corrupt and completely lost from the original purpose and mission it intended.  He has adult characters who have major personality flaws, and greedy ambitions - who manage to redeem themselves in the end in a way that doesn't clear their deeds of the past.<BR>The book has a strong female lead character, and several other stong female characters throughout the books.  One of the strong female characters is very complex, ambitious and greedy. Pullman makes her pretty dislikable throughout the book, yet her role turns out to be very important to the side of good.  It is rare to see anywhere in literature a character like this pulled off so well.<BR>I am highly impressed that this book addresses the issues it does, and forms opinions that don't go where you would expect them to go.  More amazing that this is a kid's book - I think that this book would have received alot of slack even if adults were its official target.  <BR>These books are truly unique and I am excited they exist for young adults (or younger if you are a precocious reader).  I am a big fan of Harry Potter and these books seriously rival that series.  It certainly is braver in taking on the themes it does in not so black and white of a manner.
B00006JDS4|5.0|I get a chuckle out of many people's reaction to this movie, as opposed to Deliverance.  While Deliverance had a higher budget and better acting, the plot is roughly the same - out of towner is raped by some yocals, who then pay for their crime with their lives through an act of revenge.<br />In this movie, viewers are more shocked that a woman is raped instead of a man.  Anyone who has seen Deliverance will forever remember the words, \\"Squeal like a pig.\\"  Viewers of I Spit On Your Grave are not treated to the same physiological thrills; only, raw and brutal images.<br />I found the low-budget flick very refreshing from the usual Hollywood glitz and horror film cookie-cutter format.  The plot was no worse off than, say, Friday the 13th for example.  And, it was so unusual to see an abundance of gratuitous sex and violence in an American film.<br />Worthy of note - this film has been banned in several countries, including the UK, while Deliverance received no more than an R (18) Rating.  I take this to mean that it's more socially acceptable to rape a man than a woman.<br />Aside from all the controversy, sex, and violence, I put it on par with Pink Flamingos.  You don't need a billion dollar budget to tell a story or make a good shocker film.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.  It made me wait in suspense for a scary moment.  I loved Gollum.  That actor did a great job on the movements, and the editors were outstanding on the creation of Gollum.  <br />      Legolas (Orlando Bloom) oh he is a great actor!!!  His bow and arrow character is spectacular.  Learning how to shoot arrows before Lord of The Rings was filmed in the good ol' New Zealand!  That New Zealand atmosphere is breathless!<br />...Thanks for reading my review!  :-)

B00008977N|3.0|As a long-time PG fan, I was anxious to watch this DVD, and I am referring to the DVD here, a number of reviews are for the VHS.  What a disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, the content is absolutely fabulous!  But along with the [poor] looking video, this DVD could easily be used as an example in audio engineering school on how NOT to master a live performance.  The loudest thing on the DVD is the audience clapping!  The audio track is so heavily compressed that the louder the band gets, the less you can hear.  Everything gets pushed way back, to the point where you can't really hear anything.  The audio mix is excellent, which is evidenced when the band plays a soft part.  But, instead of getting blown out of my chair, instead I'm left straining to hear anything but the compressor breathing.  What a disappointment.  The only reason I give it three stars is because the performance is excellent, the staging, the lighting, everything is great.  Too bad you can't hear it.  By the way, I have not seen or heard either the VHS or laserdisc, so I have nothing to compare to.

B00007AJF9|4.0|All historical innaccuracies aside (can you say 'Braveheart' anyone?), this is an immensely enjoyable film, and I can say that in all honesty, I generally can't stand watching period pieces.<br />Special mention in this film has to go obviously to Cate Blanchett, who deserved her Oscar nomination and then some.  But Richard Attenbourough and Geoffrey Rush are equally good, and the costume and set design is nothing short of phenomenal.  Watch this film on a big screen and you'll feel like you're a wall in the castle.  It's that real.<br />I loved this film for the same reason I love \\"I, Claudius\\".  The actors are all on their marks, and they're never found wanting for conviction.  A must-own for fans of historical drama, and a damn good popcorn film for those who're waiting for the next Michael Bay film.
B00005NRN9|5.0|What a beautiful experience.  I felt as though peace had entered my heart and my soul had been lifted to th highest peak of floating freedom and danced with the grandest love.  I recommend this DVD to all peoples.  Even in typing this review, I feel the music still stirring my soul and filling my being with love and peace.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Leaving all the subsequent politics behind, you can't give this album any less than 5 stars.  We all bought a copy back in the day, and I still have my original vinyl copy in the house.  Scratched up like you wouldn't believe, but it still hits like it always did.<br />Let's face it, there's a reason why this LP sold over 40 million and counting--it's a classic pop/r&b release with mass crossover appeal.  Although it hasn't aged as well as Prince's \\"Purple Rain\\", it's still one of the top albums of all time.<br />\\"Beat It\\", \\"Thriller\\", and \\"Billie Jean\\" obviously benefitted from the advent of MTV, but the rest of the album is just as good, if not better.  The Paul McCartney duet \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", \\"P.Y.T.\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\"; there isn't a weak link on the album.<br />I don't know that this remastered version was worth picking up JUST for the demo, but the original tracks are absolutely essential.  You should already own this.
0385421982|4.0|The Pelican Brief, by John Grisham, is a thriller guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat. This book is about Darby Shaw, a Tulane law student, who uncovered a massive conspiracy involving a prestigious law firm and of all things, pelicans. Darby Shaw gets caught up in whirlwind of adventure because she wrote a brief that linked, Victor Mattiece, an important contributor to the President, to the murders of two Supreme Justices. The result was her being the subject of a manhunt and many left dead in her wake, including her lover and professor.<BR> The story's action includes the rush to gather evidence for the biggest \\"newspaper story since Watergate.\\" It leads to Gary Grantham meeting up with Darby Shaw and the two teaming up to bring down the White House. The subplots include a romance between the two protagonists. Another is Gray Grantham's own quest to gather evidence to get a big news story and to revive his career. The book is very exciting and makes you keep the book until you finish it.<BR> The book is very suspenseful and leaves the reader wanting to learn more at the end of every chapter. The book starts out a little slowly with the exceptions of the assassinations, but it gradually picks up speed. The first part of the book describes the characters and sets up the rest of the book, but after that there is a good deal of action. This is also a romantic novel in which the main character deals with the loss of her lover to the romance of her with another. Another strength of the book is that there is a lot of detailed description of the characters. For example, when we are introduced to Victor Mattiece, we see him as \\"his skin was leathery and dark bronze. His bare feet were lined with ugly veins. His toenails were long and yellow.\\" This provides a very vivid picture.<BR> Although the book is suspenseful, the book's \\"puzzle pieces\\" do not fall together until the end. The book is very tricky and misleading. For example, at the beginning, the book makesyou think that a certain person is a bad guy only to learn in the end that that he was working undercover for the CIA. Another weakness is that this book does not mention the main antagonist many times, and the ending leaves you hanging. The ending shows Darby Shaw and Gray Grantham, a reporter, getting together, but nothing about Victor Mattiece getting captured or anything.<BR> The other main weakness is mostly the lack of development of the characters, especially the main character. What we know about Darby Shaw is mostly at a surface level. For example, we know that she feels sad for the death of her lover. However, we do not see it greatly or she does not make other people think that way. Another weakness is actually its strength. Although the book has a lot of details, the book focuses too much on them and does not really go deeply into the action. For example, when the car bomb killed her lover, we see a lot of Darby's emotion and shock, but we do not see description of how the car looked.<BR> The book is a good read for people who like adventure with a little bit of law mixed in. I will give it 7 out of 10 stars, because it was very exciting with only a few minor weaknesses. The book has some very exciting scenes. I recommend this book for people who like thrillers, but do not mind a show start.
B00005MP58|1.0|A&amp;E's production of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a 5 star masterpiece; however, the DVD recording of it is just awful! The colors are either too dark or washed out, the sound is weak, and get this: the lips aren't in sync with the words being spoken!! Until they make a better DVD, stick with the Video set, where none of these problems are present.
B000000HZT|5.0|If you liked Genesis's &quot;Duke&quot; at all, GET THIS CD NOW.  The music is much in the same vein.  Banks plays his trademark electric piano sound throughout.  The singer isn't as blah as some of the reviewers would have you think, he even has some of the vocal stylings of Collins at times.  The drums are more subdued than if Collins had played them, but all in all they're in the same style.   <br />It would have been interesting to see what this album would have sounded like with Phil singing, but it stands by itself just fine.  It grows on you!!
B000089CKH|5.0|This band has matured exponentially since 'High/Low'. That much is certain. The 'Proximity Effect' was an incredible leap for them, and 'Let Go' is an ever bigger leap from that.<br />Terrific stuff. A very well-produced, well-written endeavor. Fantastic melodic direction by Mr. Caws, vocally. This album highlights the entire band's command of composition.
B00005U2JL|5.0|Guns, God, Government.... WOW.<BR>A naked, in the dirt, gushing wound, cerebral aneurism causing blitzkrieg of the senses&#8230; What an incredible combination of sight and sound for the Marilyn Manson fanatic, or for anyone who appreciates seeing someone giving their all on the live stage, regardless of the genre.  With visually assulting concert footage from all over the world, and live, digitally re-mastered, in your face, kick in the nuts audio, this performance hits you over the head, grabs your by the throat, and forces you to keep watching.  As for the friends of mine who are not MM fans, they too commented that it was very entertaining (in that sick twisted way we all love, but don&#8217;t talk about at parties.)  Brian Warner takes his Marilyn Manson alter ego to the farthest extremes of live performance, vocal violence and physical exertion, leaving the viewer certain that there was absolutely no more for him to give, except maybe his beating heart ripped straight out of his chest.  Everyone (especially Jerry Farwell!) should see this, at least once!
B00000JGHM|5.0|One of my five favorite films ever, easily. This is an action movie with a difference - rather than being plot driven, it's character driven. You are made to care about every single character in this movie, and the way in which every character is woven together into the movie's three-hour long plot is remarkable. There are no real 'good guys' or 'bad guys' in this movie...everything is a shade of grey, with good and bad blended together to make you think. And the ending to this movie did something to me that no movie has ever done since I was four and saw Bambi - it made me cry. Now THAT'S a good movie.<br />You want every millisecond of this movie.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I highly recommend \\"Gosford Park\\". Its director, Robert Altman, has managed to make an excellent film, full of an english ironic sense of humour that I found (and still find) enchanting.<br />The main plot revolves around a typical murder mistery (the classical Agatha Christie's \\"whodunnit\\"), that it is very good in itself. However, I specially liked the way in which Altman used the background, a typical english country house, to show us the dynamics of a class (the aristocracy), in a certain period of time (the 1930s), in a certain place (english countryside).<br />What can happen when a bunch of aristocrats gather together for a shooting party? Well, according to Altman's formula almost everything... The film certainly doesn't lack action, but I believe that what makes it outstanding is how it show us the rigid division among classes in that time (that division still exist now, but they are clearly less patent). One example of that is the upstairs (guests)/downstairs (servants)division of classes.<br />The main plot is very good, and the various subplots are also greatly entertaining. Regarding the performances of the actors, I specially liked Maggie Smith's as Constance (she was perfect!!!). On the whole, worth seeing and buying...
B000002GK1|5.0|I have read some of the other reviews on badmotorfinger, and seen people putting four stars.  This album defintly deserves five stars.  I have had this album for about 6 months now and still love it to death.  It is by far the best soundgarden album, and in my opinion the greatest of grunge.  Chris cornells voice is at its peak, and you can definitly tell listening to jesus chris pose or slaves and bulldozers. I dont really know what else to say that this album is amazing and anybody who likes grunge should definitly buy this. This is a must have!
B00005JKZT|3.0|First things first this is my favorite film.  Everything else now.  It's down right stupid.  I don't think I'll change many peoples mind but being a historian and a fencer (sword fighter), I want to point out that the film was tactically a bunch of rot.  ... First of all the arrows.  I don't know what [person] was in charge of the films tactics department.  I suspect they didn't have one.  Am I the only one who's noticed that it take four slashes with a sword to kill somebody and one shot with an arrow?  In reality it is the other way around.  One hit with the sword would more likely kill a man than one hit with an arrow.  ...  Ever notice how the dragon only took one shot to send it running?  Why was everybody so scared of it?  Why didn't they just take one simple shot at it and get back to their lives.  Hitting that thing isn't tough to do.  Next.  Archery tactics.  The English sometimes began shooting at an enemy at ranges of a quarter mile, and the elves begin shooting at the last possible moment?  Remember the battle of Helmsdeep?  Next.  When the short hand held ladders went up to the castle, why didn't anybody try pushing one off?  ...  They just stood at the top of the ladder and waited politely for their enemies to climb up.  Next the big ladders: that contraption to hook it to the wall has to be one of the world's stupidest things.  Number one the chances of firing that grappling hook up and hooking it just on the wall is probably mathematically a zero.  Second the chance that one elf or human won't cut the rope that holds the grappling hook to the ladder is absolutely nothing.  (I'm just getting started here!)  The explosion that blew out the wall.  Am I the only one who noticed they picked the absolute worst place to waste on explosion?  Why not set the explosion against the base of the keep?  If you look closely the outer wall did not defend the base of the keep; and the orkii had already reached the base of the keep they could have one the battle rightthere!  ...  Next when the horses charged out of the castle to meat Gandalf the horses had no armor?!  And not one of them went down!  What kind of code of honor do you think orkii have to not slash out a horses legs?  No way!  Those horses would have been downed in seconds.  Again when the horses charged down the mountainside to save the day.  They would have been murdered by all those spears no questions asked.  (And don't tell me the light did them in remember in Fellowship of the Ring it was said that the orkii traveled by day.  Sun was maybe not their favorite thing, but they could deal with it.)  Next magic: what in the world was the director thinking?  I think Gandalf has used magical abilities a total of ONE time this film.  He's a wizard; he just doesn't do magic.  ...  When Gandalf charged over that hill he should have thrown out his staff and knocked back a hole for the horses to charge through.  Now that combined with the sun and the surprise attack would have been a believable victory. ...
B00000BKDV|3.0|This was a very important album in Iron Maiden's career. It was their cause for such huge success in the USA (and their first headlining tour of the country was for this album), it is highly regarded as their greatest by quite a few fans of the band and it was the first Iron Maiden album to feature their \\"classic\\" line-up (Dickinson, Murray, Harris, Smith, McBrain). However, for some reason, I have never got into it. Iron Maiden are my favourite band ever (maybe tied with Dream Theater) and I love so much of their stuff, but I can't get into this at all. I've owned it for a few years now and I have listened to it a lot, trying to like it, but I just don't.<br />For me, many of the songs seem to lack energy. Flight Of Icarus and Still Life seem to plod along without much substance, for faster songs Die With Your Boots On and Sun And Steel failed to impress, To Tame A Land is one of the weakest epics the band have ever written, and Quest For Fire just sucks. It is one of the worst songs they've ever done.<br />However, Maiden would be hard pressed to release an album without any highlights at all (with their best albums like Number Of The Beast and Somewhere In Time all the songs are fantastic). Where Eagles Dare is a fierce opener, The Trooper is a blistering rocker and Revelations is one of the bands most incredible songs. However, even a blind chicken can find a few grains of wheat in a farmyard, so I wouldn't say it was worth buying the album for those songs considering that better versions can be found on live compilations anyway.<br />All in all, I was incredibly disappointed with this album. For the most part, it lacks either energy or substance, is plagued by filler and is completely overshadowed by other, superior releases from the band. However, by all means listen to it and decide for yourself. After all, many people think it is one of the bands best.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Since I've owned this CD, I've been so impressed with it that I've felt completely compelled to share it with all my fellow musicians and songwriters.  Here is a band and a CD that stands up, time and time again.  From Kroeger's gut-wrenching vocals and the accompanying pounding guitars, bass and drums, I continue to feel the emotion and urgency that I'm sure the band intended.  For my own personal taste, this album is one of the most complete hard-edged rock efforts in quite sometime.  Of course, &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; is the obvious radio hit.  However, if you delve further into the tracks, you find that Kroeger has such a broad canvas on which to paint his emotions.  His musical sense, his ability to spin the lyric within the melody and his bandmates' abilities to bring their own magic and fury to the whole, has resulted in an absolute sonic masterpiece.  I look forward to more from this band and to Kroeger as a producer.  I might also recommend the bands &quot;Default&quot; and &quot;Theory of a Deadman&quot; who seem to also be influenced in a similar vein as Nickelback.  (&quot;Theory&quot; is also produced by Kroeger.)
B000002H33|5.0|I've reviewed this before. I stated how good it was and gave it a full five. However, after listening to it again the other day I realised I'd forgotton how good it was, and I still don't think I have done it justice.<br />To anyone looking to get into fast, heavy and intelligent music, look no further than this album. There are other great thrash metal bands; Slayer, Anthrax, Forbidden, Sepultura. But none have released an album quite as fine as this. Metallica reached their peak here - their albums before were a build up to this while all their albums released after failed to match it. This album is in every way a masterpiece.<br />One of the key reasons for this is the diversity in the songwriting. Just compare the sludgyness of The Thing That Should Not Be with the speed of Battery and then compare both with the beautiful instrumental section of the title track or the intro to Welcome Home (Sanitarium).<br />Metallica may have taken the prog over-board after this before releasing commercial rock but this is without a doubt one of the finest metal albums ever recorded. I usually write more in reviews but I see little point - just go and buy it if you havn't already.
B0000013GT|5.0|i knew nothing of rap when i picked up this cd and it is still one of the ones in heavy rotation in my cd players. the cd starts off strong with arguable hits on tracks 2-5, and with not sub par song the rest of the way.<br />the thing that pulls me into other outkast efforts is not the creativity that ATLiens brought to the music world (though that is a huge reason outkast is so successful) but the willingness of Big boi and dre to turn their backs to whatever is popular and to put out music that true hip hop heads will appreciate.<br />...cuz im cooler than a polar bear's toenails...
6305313687|5.0|There are very few films that I truly came away from stunned. Fight Club was one. English Patient was another. Films that pushed the boundaries, did things differently and refused to conform to cliched and predictable Hollywood movies. Films that lean away from mere entertainment and more towards art. Without a doubt, American History X is one of these films.<br />The storyline follows Daniel (Edward Furlong) and his older brother Derrick (Edward Norton). Both are restless white skinheads who are part of a neo-nazi skinhead gang. The plot unravels Derricks penchant for leadership while Daniel looks up to him in awe. Filmed in both colour and black and white, this is very powerful film-making backed up by powerful performances.<br />Much of the story holds a message, which is one that I'll leave for you to find out yourselves. It looks at racism, both from whites and blacks. It looks at those who look past the colour of someone's skin or hold no grudge for prejudice that another man holds. It looks at family and role models. It looks at the unnecessary anger that a whole generation of people can have.<br />This is a powerful and impressing film that everyone should see.
B00003CX5P|4.0|If your a fan of the originals, you may be a little surprised by this film. It has some Star Wars qualities, but is very different. Special effects have taken control of this film, which is not a good thing. The special effects create most of the sets and scenes, making it difficult for the actors to do there job. This film also features some well, less than great characters. Jar Jar's humor is, well not funny unless your a five year old. This film is my least favorite Star Wars film (including \\"Attack of the Clones\\"), but it still has it's moments. Natalie Portman's performance may not be her best, but her scenes, as Queen Padme Amidala, are some of the better ones. Including the Corucant scenes, which are only 15 minutes of the film. And the action scenes at the end are good, however Anakin's (Jake Lloyd) scene's in the spaceship, and Jar Jar's battle, can be annoying at times.<br />I really give this 3 1/2 stars but I rounded up, instead of down. And even if the movie isn't your favorite, the special features are great!
6304698658|4.0|&quot;National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation&quot; is one of the funniest Christmas movies out there. You can help but sit there and wonder how all of these crazy things happen to the Griswald Family, but whatever it is, I'm sure we the audience are very grateful.<br />This movie you cannot tire of. It keeps you rolling time after time and is great to watch all year-round, not just at Christmas!
0060537639|5.0|A brilliant, well-documented (I'm not sure those reviews calling this book poorly reasearched were written by people who had actually read the book) book. In some instances, it must be noted, the author does present evidence that hardly merits the term, but there is such a wealth of said evidence that disagreeing with his thesis is hard for any rational and open-minded person. However, I would like to see a peice-by-peice attempted refutation of his evidence, as one cannot judge the validity of such a work without arguments against the thesis and alternative interpretations of the evidence.
0894803123|5.0|I bought a Cuisanart ice cream maker and immediately bought this book to go with it, since I absolutely love Ben and Jerry's ice cream.  I decided to make a version of cookies 'n' cream with Mint Oreos (it was all I had).  I followed the recipe for the base and the cookie chopping and set it all up and waited.  After it's done, the ice cream is a little soft (due to the machine, not the recipe) but after sitting in the freezer it become hard, but not too hard to scoop.  I've had people amazed when I tell them I made the ice cream instead of buying it.  I do credit B&amp;J for the recipes... but homemade ice cream tastes just as great!  The only complaint my mom had was that it wasn't sweet enough for her (easily fixed by adding more sugar next time).  If you love their ice cream, you have to have this book.  This way, you can make your favorite flavors just the way you like them!  Like, I love Chunky Monkey, but I don't like the nuts in it so now I can make it without nuts!  Woohoo!
0393964582|4.0|This book is based on the original 1818 version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but is geared toward the reader who wants a more in-depth knowledge and understanding of this work of fiction and the writings of Mary Shelley, her husband Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and Dr. John William Polidori, Byron's friend.  The reader will find abundant annotations which help to explain the context in which it was written. A map is provided which helps to locate many of the settings described in the book. It also includes a section of reactions to various versions that have been published.  Twelve contemporary authors have submitted essays which supply a variety of perspectives on Frankenstein.  The book offers an authoritative text, contextual and source materials, and a wide range of interpretations in addition to a bibliography of other works on the topics.
B000089RVX|4.0|Very good.  Hard to categorize music style other than to compare to some similar acts like The Gathering, Lacuna Coil, Flowing Tears, and maybe Nightwish.  Basically if you like the angelic voice of a female, the hardness of hard rock/metal, you'll like listening to this.  Enjoy.
B000008COG|4.0|Yes, it's true:  AC/DC has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!  For years, the coterie of insouciant folksters (too lame to call rockers) like Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne and Bruce Springsteen are finally fading from the forefront as the Great Wall of Indifference erected against hard rock and metal begins to crumble brick by brick.  Last year, the first leak appeared in the dam, when Aerosmith was inducted, but now a full-fledged heavy metal band of hard drinking blue collar boys has bust it open.  Bon, whereever you are, I hoist a brew for you!<br />So, in the car this morning, I picked this under-rated gem to listen to to get my AC/DC fix, and I was not left wanting.  The first time I heard this record, I thought \\"huh?\\"  But after repeated listenings, it grows on ya.  This was accomplished on a cross country drive across Canada:  I bought the cassette in Kingston, Ontario, but by the time I left British Columbia and drove into Washington, we were like old friends.<br />One of the things that threw me for a loop was Brian Johnson's vocals; It sounded as though he were singing in an echo chamber, the miking was so far away.  Good vocals, nonetheless, but too distant to grab you by the throat.<br />Angus and Malcolm's twin guitar attack is honed sharp as, well, a razor's edge, and I especially love the quintessential AC/DC pentatonic blues scale when employed on this album.  Cliff's bass is thumping, and even though I'm a Phil Rudd fan, I like Simon Wright's drumming -- clean, somewhat jazzy, but it is a bit out of place on an AC/DC album; he's too free and loose with the notes, particularly on the ride and high hat cymbals.  Phil, on the other hand, is a human metronome, but he's got a sweet sound, particularly when in sync with the bass guitar.<br />Here's some of the killer tunes on the album:<br />Kissin' Dynamite:  Just a great power trip.<br />Some Sin For Nothin':  Excellent solos, ensemble playing and cool double entendre of the \\"blatant subtlety\\" variant that sets AC/DC apart from D.H. Lawrence or Walt Whitman.<br />Ruff Stuff and Two's Up:  Really dirty blues backbeat (both) and driving go-go beat (latter).  <br />Meanwhile, it may surprise listeners that I think \\"Heatseeker\\" is one of the weaker songs in this mix.  The rest are just reliable meatgrinders, and once you get a third or fourth hearing, you'll be hooked.
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis - in my opinion this is his finest offering. If you are a fan of Davis, and the legends who accompany him on this cd, you probably already own this.  If you have heard a selection or two and are curious about his music, this is the one to own.
0553801511|3.0|First, if you're a fantasy lover who's never read Robin Hobb before -- good for you! I bought this and Fool's Errand hoping for great reads and what I got was watered down fluff ala Robert Stanek. I'm sorry if this offends any Hobb fans but Hobb has obviously been taking lessons from the guy. Yuck, what a load of crud, do yourself a favor and skip this one. In fact, skip all Robin Hobb's novels and while you're at it skip Stanek to. These two together couldn't write themselves out of a wet paper bag. Like Stanek's novels, &quot;Golden Fool&quot; is more a story of backstabbing and intrigue with lots of banter and little real action. In fact, there's only one memorable scene in his whole book and its pretty much a yawn. <br />On top of this, its the same old cliche characters and drastic &quot;emotions&quot; playing like a fantasy soap operat gone bad. In a plot seemingly borrowed from Stanek everything hinges on rumors we only get glimmers of what's happening. Yeah yeah, good old Futz is determined not to repeat past mistakes and still manages to make them. Gosh, don't know where I've seen that before.<br />In the end, I cannot recommend buying this book, and if you must, wait for the paperback. I only give this 3 stars because I managed to finish it. It's more like 2 1/2 stars.
B000088E6D|5.0|Absolutely The Best!! Anyone who loves music should buy this CD.<BR>No matter what style he sings.... where does someone with all this talent come from all at once out of nowhere?
0446677450|5.0|This book has inspired me to change my way of thinking! It teaches how to make money work for you instead of working for money. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to get out of the &quot;rat race&quot;, get on the fast track and really begin living!
B00003CWL6|5.0|I can understand what all of the controversy is about American Beauty, from both sides. I think that this is a film that you either love or you hate. I loved it. The plot was twisted anyway, but the film had some twists that really make it surprising and good. Kevin Spacey delivered a character that makes it easy for the viewer to get into. I thought that American Beauty was very creative, and everything ties in together in the end. It is just the kind of movie that is real, and it makes sense, even though it's kindof weird. Life can be weird sometimes though. Anyway, you may have a completely different opinion after viewing it. Like I said, you love it or hate it. It is not a kid movie though. Its R rating is due to sexual content, including some nudity, drug content, profanity, and a scene of bloody violence. American Beauty was a piece of art. It is not your average movie.
B000002HAF|5.0|This album is exquisite and surpasses any epithets one can attach. It is loud, raunchy, melodic and diverse. Moving at a frenetic pace, Black Francis hi-lights his genius as a songwriter and vocalist. Lyrically the album is a throw back to Velvet Undergrounds dealings with the underbelly of society, but deals much more with perversion. Incest, pedophilia and the great black phallus are the topics of their songs. This is quite antithetical tolate 80's poppish music and big-blonde haired guitat indulgence. The world is not about making out in the backseat, it is about drudgery and perversion and the Pixies are here to attest to it.<BR>The first four songs on this album are masterpieces as they blast away in a gritty, hard and yet quite attractive blitzkrieg of catchy vocals and rhythms. The only thing that disrupts its forward progress is Deal's Gigantic which is the most orthodox song on the album (and like most of Deal's songs)and consequently the most boring. Where is my Mind is nice, too, but a throwaway. <BR>We pick up again with the disfunctional love ode of Cactus and rocket right back into genius with Tony's Theme which is over-indulgent, wicked and terrific. After Oh My Golly! we get a sort of medley that hilights Francis' Spainsh influence which is a rhythmic and vocally centered treat. Brick is Red finishes it off in a semi-acoustic, layed back mocking of the whole album. It is divine, brilliant and the album heard around the world...Nirvana was the end, this is the beginning.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I didn't expect much from Richard Gere or Renee Zellweger going into this movie, but they really all did such fantastic jobs. It's no wonder that it has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards. This was truly the most classy and fun movie of the year. I didn't see a more unique one at all from 2002. I have never seen a movie done like Chicago before. Musical sequences are intertwined with reality sequences that truly make Chicago a very memorable movie. It is very risque for a PG-13 movie though, and there are a few cuss words, so you might want to think before taking the kids. Other than that though, Chicago was phenominal.
B000002I4W|5.0|The music world owes a lot to Ornette Coleman. Thanks to him we got a new perspective on music, that at the time was so revolutionary, it has not been explored fully yet. He proposed to free (hence the moniker associated with it) musicians from the strict chordal structures in use up until then. Even though it might be analyzed to death, his idea was, truly, to just let EMOTION guide the performance of the music. No barriers, no rules. Just your ear and your feelings. The title does sound grandiose and arrogant maybe, but it is absolutely correct. This album does represent a new direction in Jazz and music, that not too many have been able to explore succesfully. The slower melodies exhibit a gracious dynamic flow that is simply breathtaking, while on the faster tunes, the swift interplay and expressive phrasing of Ornette and Don explore new sonorities and effects previously unknown. This album is essential listening for any true Jazz fan.  I also would reccommend works by Eric Dolphy, and the more \\"extreme\\" Albert Ayler.
B00000AF98|4.0|En los 80, el grupo se mantuvo bajo la batuta de Stanley y Carr, el estilo cambio rotundamente desde los 70: paso de rock callejero sublime, a pop-rock comercial con algunos despuntes de calidad, y lo que hay que reconocer es que este fue sin duda el mejor disco de los 80 que fabrico el grupo en este oscura época.<br />1- Crazy Crazy Nights:: Hair Metal, simple y llano, instrumentación sencilla, con un estribillo pegadizo hasta el extremo, pero esta bien.  7'5/10<br />2- I'll fight to hold you:: lo que sin duda salva a Kiss del transcurso de los tiempos fue la impresionante voz de Stanley, y esta gran balada de potentes guitarrazos es una de las mejores muestras. 8'5/10<br />3- Bang Bang you: mismo caso que el de la 1ª canción, pero con algo menos de depuración.  5'5/10<br />4- No,No,No:: el tema más duro del disco, riff rápido y bateria y bajo sin control, al igual que la voz de Stanley.  3/10<br />5- Hell or high water:: canción pura y dura de la escuela, Rock callejero de buena tinta, pero en esta ocasión fusionado con un estilo &quot;Hair&quot;, sobretodo en el estribillo. 8/10<br />6- My Way:: Stanley 100%    8/10<br />7- When the walls come down:: bastante mecánica, sin bajadas ni subidas, se hace bastante pesada.  3'5/10<br />8- Reason to live:: Lo mejor de los mejores, la mejor balada que podras eschuchar en tu vida, nada más. 10/10<br />9- Good girl gone bad:: Ineresante riff de guitarra.  7/10<br />10- Turn on the night: &quot;Hair Metal&quot;, excesivamente facilón, al pasarse en el empledo de los teclados, y la letra y voces pecando de simple.   5/10<br />11- Thief in the night: Gran cierre, para una canción, muy del estilo &quot;Asylum&quot; o &quot;Animalize&quot;.   7/10
B000069HKH|4.0|This CD is for Springsteen what \\"Supernatural\\" was for Santana: classic and yet creative: the artist at the point in life at which you can be your own without worrying about whether it sells. We had friends over for dinner the other night. I introduced the CD by saying, \\"This is very good if you like Springsteen.\\" After listening to it, my friend, who collects music, said, \\"This CD is good even if you don't like Springsteen.\\" (And I don't think he's owns any Springsteen music.)
B00000JPHF|1.0|I was delighted to receive the video in the mail today. What timing! My class of high school seniors has finished reading Mary Shelley's novel and will be taking their final tomorrow. Afterwards, I thought they would really enjoy the film. Unfortunately, I just finished viewing it and am sick. This adaptation is nothing like the book. I am scrambling around looking for one that is! I honestly feel I have wasted $...---and on my miserable salary that's painful! The acting, sets, script, camera work, and editing are ridiculously crude. I wish I had saved my money and spent it elsewhere!
B00005ATQD|3.0|The late director Stanley Kubrick was an unqualified visual genius.  Few film makers neither rivaled nor equaled his ability to fill an entire movie screen with information pertinent to the narrative structure of a film.<BR> <BR>Like Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Fritz Lang, the mature Steven Spielberg, the young Orson Welles, Martin Scorsese and Akira Kurosawa, Kubrick uses the elements of lighting, depth of field, action, composition, design, staging and sound to create motion pictures that breathe as living organisms, completely transcendent to the manufactured world of a blackened movie theatre. He will be sorely missed.<br />That said, Stanley Kubrick is also quite possibly also the most grossly overrated, pretentious and narcissistic filmmaker of the modern era. While his most famous pictures, \\"2001\\" and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", are filled with magnificent technical advances and stunning visuals, they lack the humor, the insight and the pessimistic optimism (he loves paradoxes in his films) of his real masterpieces \\"The Killing\\", \\"Paths of Glory\\", \\"Lolita\\", \\"Dr. Strangelove\\"  and the sadly overlooked \\"Barry Lyndon\\".  <BR> Which finally leads us to the much anticipated \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" .<br />For anyone who has been in a bomb shelter since the Cuban Missile Crisis, Shut  features the real life husband and wife team of Nichole Kidman and Tom Cruise as a couple who share way too much in the way of intimate secrets.  <br />Driven by nothing more than a jealous fantasy, Cruise undertakes a journey into the sexual underworld of New York's cultural elite. The film unfolds very much like a nightmarish adult version of The Wizard of Oz  (one character even taunts Cruise to come with her \\"Over the Rainbow.\\") Kidman's hilarious closing line is a crude rewriting of \\"There is no place like home.\\"<br />Crouching in the middle of the film like an ominous gargoyle-like  specter is one of the most disturbing sequences ever filmed. Straight out of Heironymous Bosch and filled withhideously masked writhing bodies, cryptic chanting, cloaked figures and demonic organ music, Kubrick makes Cruise's descent into perceived decadence complete. It is one of the most vivid portraits of Hell on Earth ever filmed. That sequence chills and haunts me to the bone still.<br />Besides the \\"hell\\" sequence, the film does contain much to reccomend it.  Kidman's performance is Oscar worthy in it's quite torment and grace. She is an actor of that most rare combination: talent, beauty and endless range. Hers is a career that will last. <br />The production design stunningly recreates New York on a London Sound Stage.<br />And of course at the center of it all is the film magician Kubrick, who does create a film of stunning visual power. It just isn't particularly entertaining or enlightening.<br />Which leads me to the final questions about the film. What is the point of it all? Is it a calculated warning to anyone thinking of wandering away from home and hearth? Are we the viewer supposed to identify with Cruise who is attracted by the promise of sensual delights, but leaves stunned by the growing evil? Or is it an excuse to film as Kubrick himself once said \\" A first class nudie film.\\"? Who knows? Who cares?<br />Although deliberate ambiguity can serve as an effective device- one that can inspire hours of meaningful debate, it all to often represents in Kubrick's world, a muddled point of view. Such is the case with \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\".
B0000027RL|4.0|this is a great cd. its starts of with once then goes to alive kind of wierd though.. even though many people say this is there best album its not. so if ur only thinking of buying 1 pearl jam cd buy riot act it has alot of great mellow songs mixed with great grunge tunes. but ten also has great grunge tunes like jeremey which is my favorite on thw album because it brings be back to the days of my child hood. it is really good cd if ur really into pearl jam buy it you wont regret it. but buy riot act before this. because also on this cd sometimes you may get bored so listen to it in more them one night. but remember u wont regret buying this cd
B00003CWL6|5.0|\\"They call me the seeker,<BR>I keep searching low and high.<BR>I won't get to get what I'm after, <BR>Till the day I die!\\"<BR> Pete Townshend- \\"The Seeker\\"<br /> Les Birnam (Kevin Spacey), a man who has lost his  fire and passion for living slowly rots in a  job that consists of being nothing more than a meaningless cipher buried in a catacomb of desks in a bland office. His life vacillates in abuse between  his success obsessed wife (Annette Benning) and his incommunicado teenage daughter. He even tells us in the opening few seconds that he has recently been killed, but then again, he had been dead for years and didn't even know it.<br />Such is the beginning of Lester's search for rebirth in the satirically focused, poignantly funny and ultimately tragic contemporary film masterpiece \\"American Beauty\\".<br />Borrowing from his idol Billy Wilder, British theatre director Sam Mendes makes a controversial and riveting film debut bringing visual life to screenwriter Allan Ball's superb script. Working with the brilliant visual artist Conrad Hall, Ball incorperates vivid imagery, clever framing and careful pacing to create a work of art without the least suggestion of pretension.<br />Mendes utilizes his intense  live theatrical training and follows to rule number one of directing: relate a clear narrative in an interesting manner that serves the script.  Unlike many young filmmakers, he achieves rule number one while also obeying rule number two: select images that enhance the narrative while making the director invisible.<br />The cast and crew deserve full marks (and, now as a postscript- the Oscar) for creating a movie that tells a clear story populated with characters we somehow care about. This is no mean feat considering that in lesser and exploitive hands the shallow suburbanites who populate the film could easily have become despised one dimensional cut-outs; or even worse yet, in the cameras of a self important visual wizard (think Terrance Malick or Stanley Kubrick), an obscure and distant philosophical tome.<br />Also richly deserving the Oscar, screenwriter Allan Ball's script plays like an economical novel as there isn't a wasted scene or extraneous bit of dialogue. The dialogue itself breathes fully and truthfully as a living organism as Ball exposes every honest wart of behavior. It also allows Lester to achieve a sense of redemption at the very end of the film as he ultimately makes a moral decision and chooses the right, thereby enabling himself to \\"walk into his house justified\\" .<br />Ball's characters are people who's obsessions and secrets lead them on a treasure seeking journey celebrating the beautiful frailty that is the human being. Although we the audience, may not desire to admit it, we certainly see either ourselves or our neighbors on the screen.<br />Understand, that this movie is certainly not for everyone. Some certainly will find it dark, cynical and in bad taste. Others, like this reviewer, an insightful, entertaining and memorable experience. Audiences viewing this film will split into such opposing camps. No one, I believe, will say \\"Oh, it was okay, I guess.\\"  <br />Such a easily quotable odyssey of a film that polarizes an audience is richly deserving of a look.  \\"American Beauty\\"  is that film.
B000003TA4|4.0|this cd is a great cd. but it could have been better. The cd starts off with the great song smells like teen sprit. what ppl forget about this song is you cant understand anything kurt is saying and it makes no sense. the wierd al version is better then that. then it goes to in bloom another cathcy tune but yet again makes no sense. then on to come as you are this song is a wonderful tune that will have u singing it for hours and hours on end a great song all together. then it goes to breed which is a very good mix from come as you are right to breed a nice fast grungey song. which actually makes some sense i guess. at least more then teen spirit. next is lithuim which is one of my favorite nirvana songs. it starts of witha nice slow song you can understand then goes right to a great chorus with great gutiar and the bass is exceptional. next polly which is a great slow melody that will bring your mind into another world. with great acoustic guitar played by kurt but once again this sone makes no sense. but still a great song. next song territorial pissings which was another great mix to bring u suddenley right out of the so called vodoo polly puts you in. next is drain you which is my favorite song on the album. it has great guitar played and great music and you can understand what he is saying and it makes sense. next is the great song lounge act witht he same verse and chorus over and over again which could get boaring but its still a great song. next is a great song that pretty much says the same thing the whole song staay away. which says stay away practically the whole song. but with kurts voice the song is still wonderful. next is a great song im on a plain which will get you thinking about kurts wierd world with lines like \\"the black sheep got blackmailed again\\" and \\"my mother died every night. and that ever so wierd but wonderful line \\"love myself better then you i know its wrong so what should i do\\" another great song. And then the okay song something in the way. personally i think this just an okay song. but then again a good choice for a closer to the cd. all in all this is a great cd but not just what nirvana is good for. so if your looking to buying one nirvana cd you shiuld check out in utero instead. if ur planning on buyin two buy in utero and incesticide and if three add nevermind to the list.

6304779356|5.0|Released in the decade of the commercial vampire (the 1980's welcomed in a slew of vampire flicks), The Lost Boys went brashly head to head at the box office with the introspective soul searching Near Dark, and emerged from the oh so brief skirmish with hardly a scratch, victorious by a wide and bloody margin. Whereas opinions differ on which of the two is the superior vampire tale, The Lost Boys's style, elegance and wit has never been questioned (or even challenged) and, like Near Dark, it has transcended box office success to become an all time cult classic, and rightfully so.<br />Taking a love of the old school vampire films and infusing them with an energy and passion that is undeniably modern, The Lost Boys spins a tale about teenage leather wearing, motorcycle riding vampires that cruise the beaches and boardwalks of the quiet coastal Californian town Santa Carla (a fictional town Santa Cruz stood in for). Drawn uncontrollably to the local siren Star (an illuminous Jami Gertz), new local Michael Emerson (Jason Patric) soon finds himself amongst the gang, at times sparring back and forth with the gang's charasmatic and self assured leader David (a brutal and blinding Kiefer Sutherland at his career defining best!) and others, dangling from railway lines, racing through the surf at lethal speeds and drinking from strange ornamental bottles. <br />Not long after, Michael begins to notice changes in himself, like his sudden irritation to sunlight, his ability to scold himself from freezing cold water (a scene from the first draft of the script, criminally omitted from the movie) and his new and frightening talent to defy the laws of gravity. While his younger brother Sam (Corey Haim) falls in with his own crowd, the monotone and serious (and all the more comical for it) Frog Brothers, (also involved with vampires from an entirely different standpoint), begins to sort the pieces of his own puzzle out, the two come together to fathom what indeed they are dealing with and whether the seemingly insurmountable odds can be overcome. Uniting against a common enemy, the brothers, Star and the Frogs, self confessed vampire killers, take on David and his gang with violent, surprisingly funny and at times, startling consequences.<br />One of the simplest and most accurate reasons for The Lost Boys's brilliance is the remarkable blend of film, music, horror, comedy and drama utilised by director Joel Schumacher. Cleverly enough, Schumacher realised that the key to the whole project was style and he drenches the film in it. From the 'distinctive' opening helicoptor crawl across the blue/black waters of the Californian ocean headed towards an inviting boardwalk, literally buzzing with 'life' to the silohettes of the bikes racing through fog shrouded forests, from the vibrancy and humour of the concert staged boardwalk to the disturbingly real and sickeningly violent infamous campfire scene (where the film really ups the ante), The Lost Boys is literally the most stylish and downright cool vampire flick in motion picture history. <br />The music, as much a character in the film as the mortal and immortal roles, compliments the on screen action with the accuracy of a narrator, editing the scenes together with a polish and finesse that is miserably lacking in Schumacher's later work. The violence, when it does happen, is shocking and sudden, clearly stating that though humour is near enough always present, 'these' vampires will not be satisfied with just the jugular. This is murder at it's most nonchalant, an inevitable vocation for vampires approached with all the enthusiasm and gusto a teenager could muster, and all the more disturbing for it. Performances are sterling from all involved, supporting the fantastic Sutherland with ease and the effects are handled with just the right amount of delicacy, never intruding or stifling the flow of the quick paced narrative. <br />The final result is a movie that could well be the best advertisement for vampirism the world has seen. Since viewing the film at the tender and highly influential age of twelve, I have since watched The Lost Boys more times than I have the courage to admit and it rightfully sits in my top five of the greatest movies ever made. If you are a vampire fan, then you should be staked through the heart if you haven't already experienced The Lost Boys. If you have, perfect isn't it?
B000069CWE|5.0|Althoough many LP fans and newcomers alike have trashed this album by branding it a \\"techno rehash\\" with too much rap, I still consider it to be a truly great CD, and one that LP should be proud of. In order to fully appriciate this CD, however, you must 1) have already thoroughly listened to Hybrid Theory, and 2) not minded the rap in it. Here's a listing of the tracks:<BR>1. Opening- This is just a 30-second Irish bagpipe/violin intro and provides the beginning for the last song.<BR>2. Pts.Of.Athrty- This is relatively unchanged from \\"Points of Authority\\" in terms of lyrics and core sound. Techno, a new hyped up beat, voice echoing, and the removal of the line \\"You live what you learn\\" after every chorus verse except the last are this song's main changes. This might actually be louder than the original.<BR>3. Enth E Nd- Completely changed from \\"In the End\\", this is now completely a hip-hop rap song and has none of the atmospheric and moody feel it once had. This is also the first of the songs where not only are the lyrics changed a bit, but also the artist who remixed the song steps in with a [long] rap verse of his own.<BR>4. Chali- A relatively pointless 20-second phone call.<BR>5. Frgt/10- Very similar to \\"Enth E Nd\\" in terms of major changes. This song, however, is much more dark and moody, but has lost its heavy rock sound in \\"Forgotten\\" in return for a beep-driven atmospheric rap sound. The guest rapper here sounds fairly intimidating.<BR>6. Pshng Me A*wy- Very different from \\"Pushing Me Away\\", but much better as it turns out. The chorus is different, but still has the screaming lyrics. The second verse breaks into a piano-driven melody that holds true to the original one and gives the song a more moody feel. A very good song, better than the original.<BR>7. Plc.4 Mie Haed- If you didn't like the excessive rap in the original \\"Place For My Head\\", you will really hate this, an almost all-rap song with extra techno clips and a guest rapper thrown in. I don't listen to this much. Not a great song.<BR>8. X-Ecutioner Style- This, along with track 9, are probably what gives this album its bad name to some. This is basic trash rap, with a guest rapper also added. I have only heard this song twice; I skip it all the time.<BR>9. H! Vltg3- A remix from an imported Hybrid Theory song, \\"High Voltage\\", but still basic trash rap with clips from a whole bunch of LP songs thrown in with a bunch of annoying disc-scratching. Very bad and annoying. A must-skip.<BR>10. Riff Raff- Another 20-second phone call.<BR>11. Wth>You- Basically an enhanced version of \\"With You\\", with a guest rapper added at the bridge. Just as good as the original, although every other normal rap verse sounds muffled.<BR>12. Ntr/Mssion- LP's version of an intermission; basically the exact same thing as \\"Opening\\".<BR>13. Ppr:Kut- A cut down and remixed version of \\"Papercut\\", this song's raw loudness has been toned down and coupled with tons of techno add-ins and two guest rappers, who both can't keep up with the speed of LP's rapper. The end has been tampered with too. <BR>14. Rnw@y- This is actually better than the original \\"Runaway\\", and adds a guest rapper at the bridge as well as some nice water-sounding effects at the beginning. Every other chorus verse, which are \\"And Never Say Goodbye\\", \\"And Never Wonder Why\\", and \\"No More Lies\\", have been taken out, and by this you can easily tell the original from the remix. The lyrics are slightly changed too. This is louder than the original. <BR>15. My<Dsmbr- The better of the two imported Hybrid Theory songs, this incarnation of \\"My December\\" is a lot softer than traditional LP music. A nice soft beat, techno effects, and nice vocal harmonies give this song a very atmospheric feel. One of the best songs on the CD.<BR>16. Stef- Another pointless phone call. Why put these in, anyway?<BR>17. By_Myslf- Whereas the rap and bridge of the original \\"By Myself\\" were rather soft and moody, this song makes them rather upbeat and loud. Otherwise, however, this is just a more techno-ish sounding version of the original.<BR>18. Kyur4 Th Ich- This adds a lot more techno to the orignial \\"Cure for the Itch\\", but it is basically the same instrumental it was.<BR>19. 1Stp Klosr- A much better version of \\"One Step Closer\\", if you're willing to listen past the 2-minute intro. This adds a sadistic screaming chant to the \\"Shut Up\\" bridge, and is a lot louder than the original was. A very good song.<BR>20. Krwlng- Both \\"Opening\\" and \\"Ntr/Mssion\\" lead up to this, the last and by far the best song on the CD. Very dark, moody, haunting, and atmospheric. It starts out just like the other two, and is similar to Track 19 in that its intro is extremely long. Eventually the familiar electronic beep music will start, however, and the song just gets better and better with every second. Eventually at the end it blasts you with the final loudness of the original \\"Crawling\\" that is louder than original. A great track.<BR>Well, that's the CD. In my opinion, LP's finest until Meteora, and a CD that is always in my rotation. If you liked Hybrid Theory, go buy this.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This album defines more than a certain genre.  It's not aimed to make the listener feel any certain way, pose any certain beliefs, nor does Siamese Dream have an over the top, anything to be artistic appeal to it.  <br />The first listen to this album displays the band (mostly Billy's) talent.  By the second listen I was in love with the melody's, humming along with almost every song.  By the fifth listen I knew over half the lyrics, and could feel Billy's pain with every chord.  <br />7 years later as I listen to my 3rd copy of this album (cd's do wear out) I am still in love.  This album is amazing.  If you love music, there is no way you can pass this experience up.  This is the album that has shaped my life.  I guess you can't say it much more real than that, as cheezy as it sounds.<br />I have over 700 cd's and this one has been one of 5 constants.  I bought this cd for Disarm, Today and Cherub Rock, I soon fell in love with Rocket, Quiet and Hummer, then my favorite tracks were Luna, Sweet Sweet, and Geek, today my favorites are Soma and my all time favorite song, Mayonaise.  <br />This album is the Pumpkins version of Dark Side of the Moon.  Breakthrew, amazing, and remains almost every true fans favorite.<br />Bottom line: Buy it, and pay for overnight shipping :)
0452282152|4.0|I wouldn't have picked this book up by myself but read it because it was a choice of my book club.  It was a wonderful surprise!  Even though it was set in the 1600's it was easy to read and a story that tells much more than just a story.  Hidden meanings that were conveyed by our club members.  A good book that will surprise you!
B00005JKZT|2.0|Absurd changes to Theoden, Grima, Gimli, Saruman, Aragorn, the Battle of Helms Deep, Treebeard, Gollum and the dynamic between Frodo and Sam, as well as some gratuitous special effects (why have the Nazgul flying scenes?  How do they further the story?), make this, as a faithful version of the book of the same name, only a one-star film.<br />What gives it two stars are the special effects generally, and the event-like nature of experiencing the film.  Once those effects are no longer the \\"newest-latest\\" and once watching the film is no longer an event, I'll probably agree with every single awards list on Earth and patently ignore the rather horrid acting (except for Miranda Otto, who is perfect as Eowyn, even if she's been driven to a silly \\"love triangle\\" role in the script), and be forced to lower the rating even further.<br />Dwarf comedy indeed...<br />If Peter Jackson wanted to make his own fantasy film, why call it The Two Towers and use characters from someone else's work?<br />It's not like Tolkien needed exposuure or anything; the literary work was valued so much that Lord of the Rings is the second-most popular book ever...behind only the Bible.<br />Second most popular EVER.<br />But instead of a faithful rendition, we get Aragorn over a cliff in a made-up Warg battle, and Faramir taking the ring to Osgiliath, in clear \\"violation\\" of who Faramir was?<br />Again, PJ should have had the courage to make his own film, and conceive his own characters.  To do much of that under the cowardice of making money off of someone else's characters and basic storyline, is rather sad.
B000002IP1|5.0|That of one who gets joyful looking at playgirl and getting molested by your rogaine played ol'pop isnt sayin much for your hilarious(not demented like you)overview of this very good album of social commentary and tales of love(not of your dad Rich jeez buddy)gosh no wonder why ya bashed this album it reflects on your life or authors it one way or another it is what it is great song after song from a legend and extremely talented musician who wrote tunes that made us think or reflect and in Rich's case made us cry from what phil's singing about. Awesome album to close the 80's with.
B00003CXXR|1.0|You know what? Despite the flaws the Lost World may have had, its still a much better movie than this disgrace to filmmaking.  Nothing, and I mean nothing in this movie works as well as the first two Jurassic Park film. The acting is down right laughable, and the story itself is nothing but a cruel joke.  The movie really has nothing to do with Jurassic Park at all, because the plot lines address in those films is not even mention in this movie. The special effects are even not up to par, and judging by the way this movie was shot in the first place, its clear that the people in charge of this train wreck did not even care if this movie was any good at all.<br />I can safely say that not only did this movie disappointed the fans in record numbers, but makes them fear on how bad the next movie will be.
B0000029DD|5.0|Encountered \\"Grace\\" by fate on a long rainy drive to North Carolina. A friend worldlessly slipped the CD in, and as the music filtered into my brain, it transformed me . It was one of the few albums where I have fallen in love at first listen. I insisted it be played over and over. It felt like someone had stuck their fist down my throat and was squeezing my heart. Jeff Buckley's voice is one that draws you in with its emotion .When my friend told me that this was Jeff's only completed album due to his premature, untimely death, I was literally sick at heart for two days, knowing that there would be no more of this great music. Haven't been this moved by an artist in a long time.
B000066AXC|4.0|I did like this movie, I didn't htink it wa steh most amazing movie ever but it was a nice stylized trick of having us deeply inside of his delusion before it's revealed that they are just that.  That was a nice touch and I think that Russell Crowe is a very good actor.  I'm always amazed at how much he can change himself to accommodate the character as seeming real.
B000088E6D|5.0|Thise cd is wonderful and upbeat and once you put it in your cd player you can't stop listening to it.  His style is very much like the voices of the past.  He sounds like a young Sinatra but he can also do songs like Crazy little thing called love and how can you mend a broken heart and make them come alive in a fresh new way.  I can't wait untill his next cd.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I realize that people speak passionatly, even irrationally so, about their favorite albums of all time.  For me, personally, this album is Top 3 ever.  For a group of chain smoking derelicts to come on the scene and play a large role in replacing garbage like pop artists on the Jive label is just heart-warming.  Many of the songs are filled with an energy that can't be described, only listened to.  While The Strokes certainly haven't invented anything original, they have taken the work of their predecessors to new levels, giving the music the driving beats and energy that has always been there, but never tapped in the right way.  I saw these guys on tour twice where I heard a number of songs that should appear on their next album, and I can already tell you that I am excited.  While nothing they ever make may reach the height they reached on &quot;Is This It&quot;, it will certainly be very good.
B000001IQH|4.0|... it starts and ends with you...(Rancid)\\" .  This is a fast paced and happy punk album with a lot of ska.  The songs are forceful (Roots Radicals; Listed MIA) and sometimes wistful (Olympia, WA); Maxwell Murder is classical punk and i (contrary to some reviewers here) like its unbridled energy.  The production is simple, which makes this album even better in my eyes. In short, this is a great band and this CD is one of their best; they enjoyed themselves doing this album and it shows. I recommend it.
B00008AY3L|4.0|I bought this album on blind faith from a good review that I read, and I am very happy with it.  Some of the religious references are a little much for me, and his voice is so similar to Lenny Kravitz, but aside from that this is some really good stuff.  The songs on the album are so diverse, ranging from some very reggage sounds to more rocky tunes.  I initially listened to the album at work on computer speakers and was very pessimistic, but when I played it on my home system, I discovered another world of sound that I hadn't noticed before.  By far one of the most musically deep and pleasing albums of the past 12 months.
B00000634J|5.0|Maybe you don't want to believe it, but John Lennon's music was and always will be relavent. Its more relavent now than ever before... John Lennon was a genius, and his music will live on whether you want it to or not. And I do! He was a voice for a generation, and when you hear these songs now- not just the ones on this album but ANY of his songs  Post-Beatle, or during the Beatles- you realize just what an impact the man made on the world and people's thinking. And how much truth he spoke. There are WAY too many haters. You can go listen to that fluffy Paul McCartney muzak if you please, but John was and will always remain the greatest to me. He was real. We need that now, where people just don't want to face reality and realize what is really going on.
6305784116|5.0|My family loves this movie, it is an especially good Disney movie for younger children since there aren't any real scary moments to leave the kids with nightmares.  When so many children's movies run rampant with violence, this one actually falls back on a plot.  It is a great movie for the evening because the kids aren't left feeling anxious or worked-up.<BR>As for the animation, it is a shame that everything is computer generated or enhanced nowadays.  It is sort of interesting to see scenes where you can identify the individual lines of a character and you can appreciate the true artistry that went into the production of each scene.
B00005JLKB|4.0|I cant wait to get this DVD Ive been watching the two incredible seasons and every single show has been great so far. I love all the characters and I love the way that u dont know if u can trust Lex Luthor after each episode! The only problem with this show is that there isent enough fighting, I would like it if he went up against 8 tough bank robbers for example, then it would be the best! I took a star off for the fighting and the graphics(although that rlly isent that big of a deal)but besides that everythings perfect!
B000088E6D|5.0|This CD is fantastic!  I loved it so much I bought one for my 78 eight year old mother who thinks he's even better than Frank Sinatra.  I especially love his version of Moondance and Fever.  I would highly recommend this CD
B000069CWE|3.0|With the release of the somewhat overproduced HYBRID THEORY, almost overnight LINKIN PARK (LP) became poster boys the for glam-boy-band-metal-pop rock set. Casual listeners forget that LP's origins feature heavy Hip-Hop influences courtesy of MC Mike Shinoda's lyrical raps and heavy sample-driven beats and Joe Hahn's incredible skills on the turntables. Early LP works lean heavy on the rap and pull back somewhat on the hard metal edge. Chester Bennington's screaming vocals still figured prominently, though were not the focus. From those beginnings, LP blended Hybrid Theory into a perfect mix of rock-rap that depending on who you ask, was generically good or uniquely awesome. Either way, Hybrid Theory was a smash appealling to rap/rock fans as well as metal/rock fans. <br />REANIMATION can be seen as a throwback to LP's old style with the hope that it would holdover fans until the second (official) album's release. Instead of new music, Reanimation features 12 remixes of the songs from the Hybrid Theory CD as well as a couple remixes from some unreleased/b-side tracks. 20 tracks total (including intermission tracks) for nearly an hour of music. The metal feel is still there, this time a little subdued while the rap element steps to the fore. Looking at some of the featured guests Kutmasta Kurt, Alchemist, Pharoahe Monch, Chali 2Na (of Jurrassic 5 fame), etc. etc. lets the listener know to get ready for some lyricists on the mic. Several songs get an extensive rap treatment including IN THE END (Enth E Nd), FORGOTTEN (Frgt/10), and PAPERCUT (PPr:Kut). In The End becomes barely recognizable with a complete lack of guitars, Bennington's piercing vocals and any emotion in Shinoda's rap. Annoying vocal loops and sound effects are the order of the day. Considering that In The End is one of LP's defining songs, it deserves a little better treatment on this CD. Forgotten is the same story except what saves this song is 2Na's smooth lyrics and the fact that it is so differentfrom the Hybrid Theory version. Still, the high powered and fast feeling of the original song is lost in this remix. Papercut manages to have a better rock sound to it, but in the end the sampled guitars and whatnot sound too much like rap remixed to a rock beat. <br />Reanimation does have some overdriven, hard and loud highlights. STAIND frontman Aaron Lewis lends his mournful voice to an orchestral (yes orchestral) remix of CRAWLING (Krwling). The result is somewhat odd, but immensely satisfying in a fusion sort of way and manages to end the CD well. Also of note and my favorite track, is Shinoda's remix of PUSHING ME AWAY (P5hng Me A*wy) featuring Stephen Richards (of TAPROOT). Bennington's and Richards' vocals lead the way with highly processed guitars following right behind. Other tracks that seemingly follow the old LP format with a new sound and an electronic feel include RUNAWAY (Rnw@y) and BY MYSELF (By Myslf). Both rock enough to satisfy the metal heads who aren't enthused by all the rap. It's also worthwhile to mention the appearance of Jonathan Davis (of KORN) on the Humble Brother's retooling of their earlier remix of ONE STEP CLOSER (1stp Klosr). A somewhat older remix, One Step Closer gets a new feeling with Davis' -er- unique sound in the mix. <br />Having said all that and despite its faults, REANIMATION is still a worthy buy for any fan of LINKIN PARK. The sound is different, but LP is getting back to its roots. In these days of nu-metal and boy-band rock funky beats and songs from artists are to be expected and crossover is an everyday word. Alt-rockers and casual LP fans might want to stay away however, if you dig Shinoda's sound and the electronic/techno side of LP give REANIMATION a spin.<br />-dlb

B00004Z459|5.0|For those who are willing to look past stupid rumors (the band was not &quot;put together&quot; and they did write their own stuff), and while we're at it nnot believe them when they try to review something, Linkin Park is a great band<br />they are nothing like N'Sync, thats really just a bunch of dribble drafted up by metal fans who're upset about the media calling teh genre nu-metal.  <BR>i suppose fortunately for them, LP never considered themselves metal.  but they never could control what teh media labels them any more then metal bands can control teh media calling them nothing but aggressive pointless by-gones from a past age that incites violence and aggression.<BR>what do you do.<br />as for radio airplay, the album did get played out, but i don't see how that factors into the quality of the album, cause the album doesn't affect how much radio's play it.<br />for those thinking LP is just another rap/rock outfit, you'd be wrong.  they sound nothing like Limp Bizkit or Papa Roach.  Instead of simply rapping over guitars, LP combines melodies from Chester Bennington and rapping from Mike Shinoda into a fusion of sounds versus rapping over rock guitars<br />i won't go into a song by song review, there are plenty of those here<br />whether you like LP will probably depend on several things<BR>if you are a &quot;true metal&quot; fan as some of teh reviewers that gave LP a bad review described tehmselves, then you probably won't like LP.  they never called themselves metal, but these &quot;true metal&quot; fans bought the description like everyone else.  i'll lay it out now.  no they're not metal.  if you are looking for metal, you won't find it here.<br />if you are looking for Bizkit like stuff, you still won't find it here<br />They are not a corporate pop group, don't believe teh people who say they are, but LP does produce quieter more melodic songs.  excuse some people for feeling not everything has to drum down to what &quot;hard rock should be&quot;<br />basically if you are looking for something thats different (and they are different, i have challenged many who say they aren't to find a band that sounds like LP and none have been able to) that doesn't mind going with quiet melodic tracks and then into louder &quot;harder&quot; tracks, a band thats willing so show some versatility and isn't ashamed to appeal the the crowds with more open listening tastes, and frankly if you're not one of those people who think hip hop/rapping is a crime against nature; then you should then look into Linkin Park<br />however, if you're a &quot;rock purist&quot;, a &quot;metal purist&quot;, one of those people who thinks rock should be &quot;hard&quot; and not &quot;watered down for the corporate machine&quot; **insert heavy sarcasm and mocking**; then yes, save yourself the time and money and don't buy Linkin Park's album<BR>it most likely won't be your cup of tea
B00005JLXC|5.0|... all I can say is wow, the special effects are awesome and the actors are fantastic especially Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin, I am sooo already waiting for the sequel and I'm hoping all cast members return to reprise their roles.<BR>I was also happy to see the godfather of comics Stan Lee in his little cameo appearance.<BR>Go and see this movie, it's a blast!!
B00008977N|3.0|I don't understand how you can produce such a bad quality video on DVD. It doesn't even match VHS quality. The picture is extremely grainy and when a fast movement occurs, it disintegrates into large square pixels. Otherwise the concert and the audio are great... but you will have to listen with your eyes closed?
B000002JS8|5.0|i love this album. halli er alltaf ti a hlaupa
B000089RVX|5.0|Well, I never EVER thought I'd like a group (other than Otep) with a female lead singer, but, I was horribly wrong.  This CD is spectacular, or, as the title says, amazing.  Amy'svoice is just awesome.  It is beautiful, yet, at the sae time, haunting in the way she sings and the tone of the songs.  The CD is jut an amazing CD how they can fill the songs that are so compelling anf beautiful, yet so extremely haunting in a sense.  The best songs off the CD are definitely Bring Me Back To Life (which is my personal fav.) and My Immortal.  I like Bring Me Back To Life because I like the way Amy and Paul McCoy of 12 Stones did it, its just a great song.  My Immortal is another awesome song because pf how beautiful it is, it's another flat out awesome song.  All in all, the CD is awesome, I can fully see how it debuted at #7 on the Billboard charts.  This CD rocks and I recommend it to most anyone.  It grows on you, trust me.
B000000YG5|5.0|Sonny Rollins , considered by many to be the quintessential live performer, admittedly felt restricted in a studio. However listening to his masterpiece Saxophone Colossus it is clear that he was on this occasion  able to capture some of the energy of a live performance on vinyl. The record is a tour-du-force of Rollins musical vision and mastery of improvisational inventiveness within a melodic and harmonic form that draws the listener in chorus after chorus.<br />Max Roach's drumming drives every track particularly the classic St Thomas. Roach and Rollins trade 4's on Blue 7 and play off of each other beautifully throughout. Tommy Flanagan's piano playing is subtle and perfectly suited to this group.<br />This is my favorite Rollins recording other than those made with Clifford Brown and Max Roach's group.
B00005ABX0|3.0|This two-fer is as good a way as any to imbibe these two albums if you are unfamiliar with them, and it contains bonus tracks to boot. These bonus tracks are fascinating, though Beach Boys fans will already have heard alternate versions of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Heroes and Villains,&quot; as well as &quot;Can't Wait Too Long,&quot; on the excellent box set &quot;Good Vibrations - 30 years of the Beach Boys.&quot; I do love &quot;You're Welcome,&quot; a simple echoey phrase repeated to a marching band bass drum and glocklenshpiel - but it is only one minute long, and probably not worth buying the whole CD for. What the aforementioned box set also contains is some of the unreleased &quot;Smile&quot; tracks that preceded &quot;Smiley Smile.&quot; Anyone who is familiar with the box set versions of songs like &quot;Wonderful,&quot; &quot;Wind Chimes,&quot; and even &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; will know that the &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; tracks are sloppy in comparison - these sound like they were recorded at home with a lot of hash in the room, which, in fact, they were. &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; overall is a fun but peurile bit of fluff, anchored only by its hit singles and the morsel that is &quot;With Me Tonight.&quot; (Okay, the canon at the end of &quot;Wind Chimes&quot; is gorgeous, but it is also barely audible.) &quot;Wild Honey&quot; continues the trend of pared-down recording at home, and showcases Carl Wilson's interest in soul records. Unfortunately, Carl's voice is far too sweet to pull off the rockin' style he attempts here. Nice try, but no dice. &quot;Wild Honey&quot; is another short album, with only &quot;Let the Wind Blow&quot; hinting at the sublime beauty we had come to expect from Brian Wilson. (&quot;I'd Love to See You&quot; has a nice melody but its words are trivial throwaways.) Completist Beach Boy fans and collectors will want to own these two albums. Others are urged to check out the box set instead, which is more than worthits price.
0898705525|4.0|Chesterton, not unlike Peter Kreeft, is a Roman Catholic thinker who has gained a noticeable readership among the ranks of evangelicals.  This particular book is regularly referred to and relied upon in evangelical works on all sorts of subjects.  As such, it is a book that evangelicals should read and take notice of.  And clearly, it is a book that many Roman Catholics will empathize with due to its clear advancement of the Roman Catholic church as the purest and most correct source of religion.<br />As has been pointed out by others, in advancing Christian orthodoxy, Chesterton takes a decidedly unorthodox approach.  Instead of advancing objective evidences or elaborate philosophical arguments, he chooses instead an approach that is actually quite funny in a way - an approach that at its core, resembles Calvinistic presuppositionalism.  This is funny since Chesterton, on more than one occasion in this book, flippantly rejects all things Calvinistic, yet I found his entire book to be rooted in an apologetic approach that is in many ways similar to Van Til.  He asserts, consistently with Van Tillianism, that those who offer objections to Christianity fundamentally lack an epistemic basis to do so since their objections presuppose and rely upon Christian values, the origin of which they later argue against.  This is brought out very clearly in his 'Paradoxes of Christianity' chapter where he critiques the hopeless inconsistency of Christianity's critics.  This was a real treat to read.<br />In the end, Chesterton advances the view that wonder, happiness, joy, and a proper balance between optimism and pessimism can only be found in Christianity.  This conclusion is based upon his own experience, and bolstered by many hypothetical and theoretical examples meant to further the point. <br />I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 for reasons that others might deem unfair.  While there were many sections of this book that were very insightful and on point, there were also sections where Chesterton seemed to be rambling toward no particular end.  This might be an unfair criticism because the book was not meant to be a systematic apologetic for Christianity, but instead a semi-autobiographical account that charts Chesterton's own thought process.  As a result, the reader will also notice that Orthodoxy is a work that is nearly devoid of Biblical references, much less exegesis.  I found this problematic precisely because one could read this book, conclude that Chesterton was completely right in everything he said, and still be able to reject Christianity completely since the book did not interact at all with Biblical truths.<br />Lastly, I must say having read this book, it is no surprise to me that a guy like Philip Yancey would be bonkers over it (Yancey wrote the introduction to the edition of the book I read).  Chesterton was a man who embraced Roman Catholicism in a Protestant environment, and did so defiantly.  In many ways, Chesterton writes as if he is an army of one.  Not coincidentally, this also tends to be the attitude that Yancey has adopted relative to his views within evangelicalism.  As such, Yancey's introduction to this book mindlessly strikes out against other evangelicals who don't see the world the way he does, and it is clear that his inspiration lies at least in part in Chesterton.  I couldn't help but get the feeling that both of these individuals, to greater or lesser degrees, came to embrace the idea of being contrary for the sake of being contrary, and then justifying it with language extolling the virtue of being revolutionary, as if this is supposed to be an end in itself.  It is admittedly hard for me to have much respect for such views, and maybe I'm misreading both men.  But that was certainly the indication I got after reading this book, and it is a position that is not only anti-intellectual, but easily becomes completely self-serving.<br />In the end, the book is a good read which makes many insightful points.  Chesterton clearly believed that truth should translate to joy and wonder.  This is certainly a message that all believers should pay attention to, and to this end, I think this book succeeds.
B00007AJGH|5.0|\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" was a huge hit when it was released in 1988 and made Bob Hoskins a star.  It successfully combined live action with animation and featured a strong and funny cast of characters and an entertaining storyline.<br />To best describe this film to the uninitiated would probably require a comparison with \\"L.A. Confidential\\" (with PG-friendly/cartoon violence) and a Looney Tunes movie.  It is fun, boisterous and entertaining with memorable performances by Bob Hoskins (as Eddie Valiant), Christopher Lloyd (as Judge Doom), Roger Rabbit (as himself) and that sultry scene-stealer Jessica Rabbit (as herself and voiced by Kathleen Turner).  A veritable who's who in animation, this film features cameos by Mickey & Minnie Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam, Daffy Duck, Goofy and Betty Boop, to name a few.<br />The VISTA SERIES is especially impressive given the many, many special features that are included.  The packaging alone - with a case that looks like a detective's portfolio/folder - is a treat.  Add to that the following:<br />1) Audio commentary by the filmmakers led by director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump)<BR>2) Facts and trivia<BR>3) \\"The Pig Head Sequence\\" deleted scene<BR>4) \\"Before and After\\" split-screen comparisons<BR>5) 2 behind-the-scenes documentaries, including an new, exclusive in-depth featurette<BR>6) A DVD game<BR>7) 3 animated shorts<BR>and more!!<br />The film itself is well worth the price of the DVD. Add to that the wealth of special features and this promises to be one of the best DVDs of the year.  Animation, action/adventure and comedy fans will find this a special treat and I highly recommend this family-friendly (PG) film to everyone!
0345457684|5.0|Richard Morgan's debut novel is a perfect example of the new breed of UK sci-fi and fantasy writers that are revolutionizing the genre. From Alastair Reynolds gothic space operas to China Mieville's baroque genius, this group is the best thing that happened to discriminating readers in ages, genre aficionados or not. Morgan's book is a solid slice of cyberpunk noir set in a brutal future san francisco that seems haunted by william gibson, raymond chandler and the warchoski brothers. His writing is sharp, full of energy. His plotting is solid and his characters snap with wit and invention. Violent and no-nonsense, this novel is a joy to read, a high-octane injection of fun, intelligence and sheer storytelling. Save yourself from the lame, formulaic and tired drivel that jams the shelves and plunge into virtual scifi-heaven, or hell...
B00000JMQE|5.0|1985: Despite the comments of other reviewers, such as the one nex to mine, Walter Murch's \\"Return To Oz\\" is an incredible film, true to the novels by L. Frank Baum and a worthy sequel to the 1939 \\"Wizard Of Oz\\". True, the sing-song, luminous quality of the first film is gone and true, an old classic can never really have a successful sequel (even Gone With The Wind had a sequel \\"Scarlett: Tomorrow Is Another Day\\" which was never as praiseworthy) - but \\"Return to Oz\\" captivates us and transports us yet again to the magic land envisioned by L. Frank Baum and in my personal opinion, works a miracle. The cinematography, visual effects and beautifully haunting music are combined to make a masterpiece.<br />First of all, \\"Return to Oz\\" is true to the novels by L. Frank Baum. Around the turn of the century (1912-1918), L. Frank Baum created \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\", whose plot is treated in the 1939 version starring Judy Garland. A young girl from Kansas is taken to an enchanted land, befriends a scarecrow, a tin man and a cowardly lion, defeats an evil witch and returns home via the magic of shimmering ruby slippers. You might say that although the first film was tremendously successful, a classic and a work of art, there are some imperfections. For example, Dorothy should be played by a little girl, roughly ages 8 to 10, to be more in tune with the novel, but Judy Garland was not ages 8 to 10. On the other hand, Fairuza Balk (in her debut, would later appear in other films, including \\"The Craft\\"), is 10 at the time of the film's production, looks more like Dorothy and performs the role with precision and care. A lot of the people who saw the 1985 film were disappointed at the events in the first minutes of the film- no one believes that Dorothy has been to Oz and she is taken to a psychiatric clinic where she will undergo shock therapy. This emphasizes horror and more cynical aspects of a children's story, but it is a scene that is completely harmless.<br />This film is drawnfrom elements in the two novels \\"The Land Of Oz\\" and \\"Ozma Of Oz\\". A Gothic, darker mood dominates the plot. An evil Gnome King (played by a powerful-voiced Nicol Williamson, formerly Merlin form John Boorman's 1981 Excalibur) has taken over Oz, stolen the emeralds from the Emerald City, broken the Yellow Brick Road and turned its inhabitants into stone. Princess Mombi (Jean Marsh), a sinister headless queen who changes her heads frequently, now rules over the Emerald City and has trapped  the rightful child queen Ozma in a magic mirror.<br /> Dorothy befriends some new Oz creatures- a talking hen named Bellina, a wind-up robotic army general named Tick-Tock, the stick-thin, Halloween-costume-looking Jack Pumpkinhead (who would not be out of place in a Tim Burton film or in \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\"), and a gump's head. Outsmarting the evil Gnome King and his desire to turn Dorothy and her friends into ornaments as part of his collection, he is defeated and the melancholy, dead Oz becomes once again the vibrant, peaceful and happy world it once was. Although Dorothy is wanted as queen, she instead pulls out of the magic mirror its rightful queen, Ozma, who turns out to be Dorothy's own alter ego and \\"double\\" in Oz. Dorothy returns to her plain farm life in Kansas but she can glimpse the magic world of Oz and return whenever she wants through a magic mirror.<br />This film is a perfect follow up to the old classic and it will delight audiences and generations of children as well as adults. The magic returns and on DVD, the experience is very refreshing, included is scene selections and commentary by the now grown up Fairuza Balk.
B00006LPEY|5.0|I've watched Akira over and over on my VHS and it's a new experience every time I watch it. I have also read the Comic over and over (which is far more intense), but I love this movie so much that I want it on DVD.  The problem is that any Akira DVD I can find has a new English translation, which I bought and resold, but I'm looking for one with the original English translation.  The new translation just throws me off becaue in my head all I can hear is the original.  The new translation is all wrong.  Is this the one with the Original English translation like on the VHS?
0385504209|2.0|There's far too much math, codes and cryptology, art history, and religious history in this book, and far too little thriller.  The writing is pedestrian, and the characterization is nil.  That said, the premise is very intriguing -- but unfortunately the first review, above, gives away the big secret!  So you lose that suspense -- you already know what they're going to find out.  So I'm mixed about this novel.  The author is clearly smart, and it's original, but it doesn't really live up to the hype.
0812550706|5.0|I totally loved this book from start to finish.  Anyone who is a fan of the Playstation/Nintendo genre will love it too.  Future Earth is at war with a race of aliens.  The only hope in defeating the aliens lies in have \\"computer game simulation\\" like skills.  Children are trained in a military academy using all kinds of virtual war games.  The training is inspired by the skills of a great leader who was able to rout the aliens in one of the few decisive battles that the Earth had ever won against the alien.<br />Endor, an outcast in society is thrust into the training academy where he proceeds to become possibly one of the greatest virtual game generals to ever train.<br />The book also brings into play the idea of \\"forced\\" population control.  In order to have a child, you must be approved by the government.  Though apparently not a big issue with regard to the rest of the book it is interesting anyway.
038533558X|5.0|Harlan Coban has written another deeply plotted, masterful thriller that keeps the pages turning. GONE FOR GOOD is not only full of surprises as the backgrounds and motives for each character are revealed, it also draws the reader in emotionally. Coban offers insights into the world of abuse and what it is like to grow up in families where physical and emotional abuse is the language used to teach life's lessons. Running away to a life on the streets is often the result as children attemot to escape the pain and confusion found in their own abusive environments.<br />It is with these young people that protagonist Will Klein works and from whom he learns vital information about his older brother, accused of murder and on the run for the last eleven years. The plot has several story lines which center around Will's relationships with, and his knowledge of, several of the novel's intriguing characters. Each character has a mysterious past which Will eventually uncovers and with those revelations come stunning surprises that make this Coban's best thriller yet. The final chapter ties all the loose ends together and brings GONE FOR GOOD to the kind of fulfilling conclusion readers of Harlan Coban's books have learned to expect.

B00005JLSC|5.0|Think Hollywood actors cant be multi-talented?  Think again.  Chicago is the product of countless hours spent with vocal coaches and choreographers to perfect the art of the movie musical and director Rob Marshall has hit the jackpot  his whole cast can sing, dance and act as if they were indubitably part of a Broadway troupe.<br />Chicago starts off on a literal high note, the films energy remaining vigorous to the closing credits.  The call of five-six-seven-eight! is sounded by a bandleader in a smoky nightclub as an unseen woman in stilettos struts through the rear entrance.  Making a hasty costume change after killing her husband and her sister Veronica in a jealous rage, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) has little qualms about performing their two-woman vignette on her own.  She rushes the stage and in relishing the spotlight, the self-absorbed starlet doesnt even notice the Chicago police storming in to arrest her as she enthusiastically belts the opening number to what is, from the very start, a fantastic show.<br />Watching enviously from the audience is Roxie Hart (Zellweger), an aspiring singer who longs for her own stage act that will one day make her a star.  So hungry is she for glory that shell step over  or slaughter - anyone that stands in the way.<br />In due time, Velma and Roxie both become jailbirds and once imprisoned for their misdeeds, the best musical numbers come into play.  At the femme brig, Roxie meets some interesting prisoners and is formally introduced to Mama Morton (Queen Latifah), a tough-talking prison matron with a soft spot for attractive dames.  Roxie has scruples about her chances of surviving hard time and starts feeding Mama the ol damsel in distress routine, convincing her to make a phone call to a high-powered attorney named Billy Flynn (Gere).  Knowing shell receive a death sentence by hanging if she doesnt secure herself a trial, she charms Billy into taking her case.  Unfortunately, every woman in the prison is vying for Flynn and Roxie and Velma start butting heads, the brash blonde even stealing the trial date that Velma had originally secured.  While waiting for her first day in court, her imagination brings her comfort, her mind conjuring some pretty spectacular song n dance sequences.  The most entertaining sketch comes from Cell Block Tango, six inmates sharing their salacious murder stories (and then he ran into my knife  he ran into my knife ten times.).  Other sassy numbers include Razzle Dazzle, I Cant Do It Alone and my personal favorite We Both Reached For The Gun.  Each song is seamlessly woven into the action, a musical number starting almost immediately after another has ended.  Chicago ends on a literal bang, the finale containing an original song written especially for the film that brings down the house.<br />Its easy to identify the theater veterans.  Zeta-Jones, in a tour-de-force performance that has earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, once belonged to a Catholic performance troupe in her childhood and starred in productions of Annie, Bugsy Malone, The Pajama Game and 42nd Street.  Gere, an accomplished pianist and composer, polished his vocals and fancy footwork up from his last foray into theater some twenty years ago. Considering who else the producers and casting directors had in mind for the part of Billy Flynn (John Travolta, Kevin Spacey and Hugh Jackman were all considered), Gere is a pleasant surprise and my only disappointment is that the Academy failed to notice him.  Christine Baranski, John C. Reilly, Deirdre Goodwin and Taye Diggs round out the theater veterans, the latter two of which made an appearance in the 1998 Broadway revival of Chicago.<br />Who really astonishes here is Renee Zellweger.  Director Rob Marshall really took a chance on the 32-year-old Texan - she had absolutely no vocal or dancetraining whatsoever (though no one would know this watching her  shes that good).  She prepared for the role of Roxie Hart not only by watching well-bred co-star Zeta-Jones but endured a grueling schedule of vocal and dance instruction for 10 months to meet professional criterion.  For someone whos never set foot on a stage, she has managed to gain her second nomination for Best Actress for doing just that  it was a risk well-worth taking after all.  Also astounding is Queen Latifah - she belts When Youre Good To Mama with such gusto that one would think shes been on Broadway all along.  Even more of a shock is her very first appearance on a A-list of Academy Award nominees, not to mention being up against co-star Zeta-Jones in the very same category.<br />Probably the most awe-inspiring aspect here is the man behind the iron curtain.  Rob Marshall, who has been a dancer and choreographer for several years, has taken his first solo stab at directing  and hes chosen a major motion picture to oversee, no less, a medium completely apart from musical theater.  Having co-directed the wildly successful 1998 revival of Cabaret, Marshall worked with then unknown director Sam Mendes (who won an Academy Award two years later for American Beauty) and gained a good amount of knowledge as to what it took to helm a production.  Not long after, he was called upon by Miramax producer Harvey Weinstein to discuss a film version of the Broadway musical Rent but pitched his ideas for Chicago instead.  Weinstein and others gave Marshall the green light and four years later, his dream was realized.  A virtually unknown member of the entertainment community, he now has a chance of winning an Oscar for Best Director (much like Sam Mendes out-of-the-blue nomination and victory).  A little golden man on his mantle will not only make him a household name but will also be the ticket to numerous offers to direct and/or produce over the next few years.<br />Bottom line, Id have to say its an incredible case of beginners luck for all involved.  I think it goes without saying that not only will Chicago be a hit on Oscar night but it will also make an impact with audiences when the DVD (no doubt loaded with special features) hits the shelves sometime this year.dance training whatsoever (though no one would know this watching her  shes that good).

B00006JDVV|1.0|The plot was an excellent idea. How it was done was not near excellent. Reign of Fire seems to be more concerned with nice looking CG of dragons breathing fire on defenseless civilians than anything else.<br />The movie is basically entirely filler; the only real thing that happened was the climactic moment at the end, which wasn't terribly exciting anyways. The lines are not atrocious, and the acting isn't badly done, but the movie has so little actual plot content that it barely deserves one star.

Be careful with your tools: they are precision instruments, not butcher's cutlery.<br />&quot;Silence like a cancer grows&quot; is an excellent line. It's good because it is FITTINGLY archaic. The evocation of the Romantic spirit had a powerful effect on an entire generation, and it is still relevant in today's environment of increasing censorship and belated pseudo-sophistication--so aptly embodied by our oh-so worldly music critic.

This is one gift that I wish I had had before my 3rd baby arrived and even better before my 1st arrived.  The EASY method is an absolute lifesaver.  It's good for baby and it's great for Mom!  This book is my standard gift for any new Moms and all baby showers I attend from here on out!  I recommend it to all new Mom's, including those with multiples and premature babies.
B000068FUM|4.0|The 1992 classic &quot;Hollywood Town Hall&quot; is undeniably the highlight of The Jayhawks' career.  That album was tight, focused and absolutely unforgettable.  It was as if the ghost of Gram Parsons had come back to Earth and began making music again.  Following up any classic, however, usually proves to be problematic, and &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass&quot; is no exception.  For most bands, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; would be a triumph, but unfortunately it pales in comparison to its predecessor.<br />Simply put &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; is not as carefully constructed as its predecessor.  The songs have a tendency to meander and there are not as many good hooks to hang your hat on.  Nevertheless, &quot;I'd Run Away,&quot; &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Over My Shoulder&quot; are tartly sweet and satisfying.  Also fine is the album's closer, &quot;Ten Little Kids,&quot; which contains the strongest hook on the record.  Some of the other tracks feel like filler material and some signs of the fatigue that likely led to the departure of the band's cofounder, Mark Olson, are evident.<br />Overall, a decent follow up to a classic album that contains a few gems in its own right.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Songs for the Deaf is arguably the best album of 2002. It embraces both new metal ideas and the classic rock spirit. The riffs are at times simple and at others complicated but they are constantly inovative. When i first bought this album i wasnt sure if it would be worth it, but the moment the disc began to rotate i knew that it was somthing special. <BR> The album could be considerd a concept album, te record is lined with a concept of the los angeles raionetwork. And it is just this side of brilliant. It's good to see someone doing somthing  creative with rock instead of simply telling you how much they hate you, or how much they hate life. <BR> This compilation completely cuts the fat. There is never a dull or unoriginal moment. A definite must for all metal heads who can no longer stomac Korn. Viva.
B000002UAC|5.0|This is an wonderful album! &quot;It won't be long&quot; is a perfect opening track, with great energy. The second track, &quot;All I have to do&quot; is slightly slower and bluesier. &quot;Till there was you&quot; is, even though not a Lennon/McCartney song, is one of my favorite Beatles songs. Skipping ahead a little, Please Mister Postman is one of my favorite songs, with John Lennon's raw, brash voice (which I really like) booming out. Then comes Chuck Berry's &quot;Roll Over Beetoven&quot; with the Beatles still retaining that great Chuck Berry 1950's rock n' roll sound. Skipping ahead a few more numbers, &quot;I wanna be your man&quot; is a great song by the Beatles. Skipping ahead again, &quot;Money&quot; is a great closing number similar to &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;.<BR>Overall, this is a great album and I highly recommend it to anyone. Enjoy!

B00000JLWW|1.0|Much has been said and written about this mega-movie. People tend to either love it or hate it. Personally, I belong to the second category. The film's special effects are generally impressive, but the plot is so utterly stupid that it makes the average soap opera look like fine art. Rarely have so many cliches been used in the same story, the characters are stereotypes and the plot turns are generally very predictable. James Cameron made some fine films in the 1980s, but in the 1990s he lost his touch, which is evident here. Still, the film won both Best Picture and Best Director Oscars (instead of LA Confidential), which once again proves that the academy tends to reward the wrong films.

0783225733|2.0|If anyone has been over to the reviews for the Back to the Future trilogy boxed set, you'll see that there are many people who are dissapointed at how Universal formatted the DVD's for Widescreen. It seems that they just took the Fullscreen version and Cropped it again to make it widescreen instead of adding more of the movie to the sides. <BR>Well, I'm afraid that Apollo 13 is the same way. I compared it to my old VHS copy and there is definitely MORE of the picture included in the VHS version.

B00005RYKV|3.0|This is the city. Los Angeles, California. Swimming pools, movie stars, and Yakuza hitmen fighting for control of the streets with Chicano druglords and African-American gangstas. Just another typical day in sunny SoCal, according to Japanese cult director \\"Beat\\" Takeshi Kitano, in his first U.S.-released film.  Kitano directs himself as the \\"marked\\" Yakuza who flees to the States, hooks up with his \\"adopted\\" brother (a low-level L.A. drug dealer) and his pals, then becomes Crimelord of Los Angeles in what appears to be a period of only a month or two. Action fans will probably be somewhat sated just by the sheer number of killings (I stopped counting after the first 2 dozen) yet turned off by the deliberate pacing and long, static takes. Arthouse fans will admire the deft cinematic touches and hip music score, but will probably find the frequent shootings and self-mutilations a bit overboard. Kitano the actor (an acquired taste) is in top form; Kitano the director seems less confident than usual, as if he was deliberately \\"dumbing down\\" for U.S. audiences (and can anyone who has viewed a Vin Diesel movie blame him?). Best enjoyed if you don't think about it too much; genre fans might detect similarities to the existential 60's Yakuza cult classic \\"Tokyo Drifter\\".

Well, after a culmination of years I finally wondered, if their songs are so good then why don't I have one of their CDs?!  Therefore, I went out and bought the freshly released By the Way.  Well, I cannot talk about their development but I can tell you this is one of the best CD's I have ever had and that is saying a lot, trust me.  In fact, it is pretty much a perfect CD.  I cannot think of a single bad song on it and I know that there are a lot of and great songs.  My personal favorites, in order, are \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"By The Way\\", \\"Dosed\\", and \\"The Zephyr Song\\".  This CD proves yet again how much talent the Peppers really have.  This is a definite CD to get, one of my personal favorites.
B00006IU73|5.0|If you saw me over last year and asked me about Porcupine Tree; I would have given you a weird look, maybe laughed at the band's name.  But ever since one of my college porfessor's introduced me to the band...I have been in a trance.  If you asked me to  pick a favorite song off of this disc...i couldn't do it.  I love them ALL too much!  C'mon with The SOund of Muzak, Gravity Eyelids, and Collapse the Light into Earth, how can you not love these guys?!
B000088E6D|3.0|One night on American Idol, Simon commented that while one contestant's singing was good, he could hear equally good singing in any Amusement Park show in the country.<br />That's pretty much Michael Buble.<br />He got his break performing at the wedding of the daughter of a former (and not-well-liked) Prime Minister of Canada. Among the guests was David Foster, also a Canadian. The ex-PM whispered into Foster's ear, and apparently, Foster took it as some kind of royal command. He recorded Buble performing a number of great songs with terrific studio musicians. I myself can't carry a tune in a plastic bucket, but with that kind of backing, I'd sound passable.<br />Buble's a decent enough wedding singer, but, really, there are 5,000 equally good singers out there who didn't get David Foster to produce them all of whom sound just as good.<br />If you don't believe me, buy the import version of Robbie Williams' \\"Swing While You're Winning\\". The #1 selling album in 2001 in Europe, it didn't even get a release over here. Sounds just as good.<br />And why would anyone buy either of these albums if they don't already have a healthy collection of the real deal, Frank Sinatra? That's like buying a Ford Focus for the same money as a Rolls Royce.<br />Finally, to correct Amazon[.com]'s review, Buble is NOT Canadian, but American-made.<br />Please. We get blamed for enough already.
0385484518|5.0|For myself and many of my freinds, death is not something we face with cheer. It is usually something we try to avoid at all costs. Morrie is the exception to this rule. He takes death like a bull by the horns, dispelling the mystery of fear that usually lies in our hearts. He is a humanist with a heart of hearts. Most people would not admit to having many of the feelings that Morrie expresses in this book. Secretly they probably wish they could. He is a man of unbelievable courage that is only outshined by his selflessness and will to give one last lesson to whomever can prosper from it. The lucky sole who winds up needing Morries' help more than most is his former student Mitch. Mitch admired and listened to all the advice Morrie gave through the years. Unfortunately it took Morrie being on his deathbed for him to really take it seriously and apply the advice to his own life. They both appear to be each others salvation, but Mitchs' life would have never been complete were it not for Morrie. <BR>This is an excellent book for anyone that thinks they know everything there is to know about themself and need to find the truth about who you they are. Most people have a Morrie somewhere in their life and just do not know it. Luckily I know who my Morrie is, and I am thankful for it.
074322454X|5.0|Ambrose has always been good at depicting the war through the eyes and experiences of individual or small groups of soldiers.  This has never been truer nor better done than in his book Band of Brothers.  This book is not about all the allies, nor is it even about all the American soldiers; instead, it is about one rifle company, Easy Company, doing what had to be done.  Ambrose does not paint pretty pictures about their heroisms; he just tells their story and lets their actions speak for themselves.  In fact, Ambrose does such a great job at this that I felt personally involved, which is something that history books usually discourage.  As you read about Easy Company from their training to their final action at Hitler's Eagle's Nest you cannot help but be awed by their actions and wonder if you, in the same position, would be able to do the same thing.  This great book tells more about the soldiers themselves than the numbers of kills they got.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, even if you have little interest of World War II.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Kudos is indeed well deserved for Rhino Record's re-release of this classic Yes album. Although Fragile was remastered previously (in 1994), it's astounding what 10 years of technological advances can do. As other reviewers have mentioned, the sound quality on this disc is impeccable. The highs sparkle and the lows hit hard. On the other hand, I was disappointed to note that whereas on the original album the keyboards were heavily spotlighted in the mix, here they're shunned to the background. I could barely make out the ominous Mellotron chords at the beginning of &quot;Heart of the Sunrise.&quot; Instead, the percussion and Chris Squire's thundering bass are favored. Perhaps it's just a sad commentary on current musical fashion, where keyboards are quite passe and heavy bass is all the rage.<br />If you're a Yes fan you no doubt already own this album, but I highly recommend buying this remaster, if only for the amazing audio fidelity.
0385504209|5.0|This book grips you from the first page. It keeps you in suspense, with many twists and turns, right until the end. The author's vast knowledge of religion and art history certainly lend to the suspense and makes The Da Vinci Code stand out from other books in this genre. Have an art history book on hand when you read it - and maybe a bible and the Internet, too. Have fun!
1881273156|5.0|Highly recommended even for the couple who thinks they've got it all figured out and feel they have no major conflicts.<br />As the author promised, there was a noticeable improvement in my relationship with my honey after reading this book. In fact, with my new awareness I noticed right away that my favorite guy opened up and looked more happy and relaxed than ever. This in turn made me feel great. It's been months since I read this book and I can honestly say we're on a better path than we've ever been. <br />This book isn't just about big problems, its also about getting over past offenses and dealing with the small disappointments that happen weekly -- so you can stay together forever and be happy at the same time!!<br />This book is an highly valuable education about understanding and communicating one's own needs as well as knowing how to better love-up one's best friend and life mate. I owe much to Gary Chapman's wonderful book.

0385504209|4.0|When was the last time you read a thriller that made you compulsively want to discuss it with friends, neighbors, other people in a restaurant?<br />  Using a fairly standard thriller genre, Dan Brown packs it so full of fascinating scientific, historical, and art facts that you will constantly be hitting google to look for more information.<br />  As in:  I've got to see a print of The Last Supper immediately!  What kind of airplane is that? I've got to find out more about the Priory of Sion right now!  Where's a map of the Louvre?<br />  The reader is given a chance to solve the puzzles before the answers are revealed, and the plot line is so compressed (the whole book takes place in under 24 hours) that you never get bogged down.<br />Great for thriller fans or art fans or religous conspirators!
B00006IX0R|3.0|But I guess they must have Ocean Spray over there.  The earlier work is nice to hear because the chick singer sounds more like a woman than an Irish female version of W.C. Fields.  &quot;Dreams&quot; is an almost perfect song.  It could have used some fine tuning in the lyrics department... and there is one really stupid echoed lyric where she sings &quot;You're a dream to me.&quot;  Instead of leaving it alone or using reverb she sings &quot;Dream to me&quot; again and it messes with the continuity of the song.  If it wasn't for that they have achieved pop perfection.
B00005JLWN|5.0|The most underrated film of the year. NOT a Matrix ripoff. It has a very compelling story line and action sequences that kick you in the gut. SEE IT NOW!!
B00000I07R|5.0|I don't really care for Bon Jovi's band of arena rock but \\"Keep the Faith\\" is a consistently good album with strong songs. Jon tries to channel Springsteen's low rasp in the title track but it doesn't really work. The upbeat \\"Sleep When I'm Dead\\" really is a lot of fun the first few times you hear it. \\"In These Arms\\" is also a catchy pop tune that you'll get sick of in no time. \\"Bed of Roses\\" is a decent power ballad with a pretty awesome Sambora solo in the middle of it. All these songs, of course, have been oversaturated and if you've even turned on the radio in the last 10 years, you've heard all of these to death. Still, I give props to the Jersey boys for writing a consistently good album.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Despite the fact that there isnt that much of a plot, Blade II is a good horror action movie. It's a good, though not better follow up to the original Blade. If your looking for a comic book movie darker than spider man... this movie is very entertaining.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Other reviewers have done a magnificent job of describing the intricacies and content of this DVD set, so I won't repeat it. I just want to convey to you the lasting effect this series will leave with you. It somehow exposes you to the utter horror that is war, yet left me with a longing to fight for our country. That is exactly what this series leaves you with: honor and horror. The DVD set is worth every penny of the price, the packaging is wonderful, the historical facts you have available to you on every disc are indispensable, and the entire viewing experience is satisfying like nothing else I have ever viewed on television. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg truly show their genius in turning such a tough (and true) subject matter into such an outstanding and astounding work of art.
B0000549B0|5.0|Every once in a while you see a movie that makes you just feel good.  Let's say, for instance, you get cut off on the freeway while heading to work; then when you get there, your desk has been moved into the supply closet; then the same guy who cut you off in the morning cuts you off again on your way home; then you get home to find your wife in bed with your Uncle Morty: and finally, you find that your dog has left you for your neighbor with the bigger yard and the pool.  All you'd have to do is throw on your trusty copy of Harvey and you'd be smiling in no time, although it would probably help to beat the snot out of Uncle Morty first.  Harvey is just one of those movies that doesn't necessarily captivate your mind, but it does a number on your heart.  Elwood P. Dowds is one of those characters that doesn't exist in reality and it's a shame that there aren't people like him.  In his immortal words, &quot;My mother once told me that in this world you have to be oh so smart, or oh so pleasant.  For years I was smart.  I recommend pleasant.&quot;  Jimmy Stewart is magnificent.  Nobody could bring this role to life the way he did.  In recent years the only movie I've seen that really made me feel as good as I did the first time I saw Harvey, was Amelie, and for me to compare anything to Amelie is really saying something.  For anyone who loves Jimmy Stewart, pookas, or is just having a bad day, this is the movie for you.  I'm not one to make broad generalizations, but anyone who doesn't like this movie probably doesn't have a reflection.
0895292211|4.0|In this \\"Enzyme Nutrition\\", Eddie Howell and May Murray managed to squeeze a lot of information into a compact space. A good effort indeed!<BR>The book is small; but, touched every vital point. Its outline good, and includes: the catalytic nature of food enzymes; their individual sources; stability; instability; as well as other biochemical and physiological characteristics. <BR>This book will be of great benefit to nutritionist/dieticians, biochemists, pharmacologists, and many others.  Its theme is simple and straightforward. Still, I will advise any non-science biased enthusiasts (like: bodybuilders and fitness [people]), who would like to venture into it, to keep a biochemistry dictionary at hand. \\"Enzyme Nutrition\\" will assist its readers in assessing and selecting healthy natural foods. It is an ideal and affordable advisor, which diabetics and other persons with limited food choice would enjoy reading.
B00004R9A4|5.0|I would love to thank Disney Studios for finally giving one of their classics the great treatment it deserves. From the same people who brought us &quot;Marry Poppins&quot; comes &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;. Angela Lansbury is no Julie Andrews, but she brings a heart warming performance to the movie. You have to give her credit for being able to act so seriously when she is riding around London on a flying bed. The whole story of a flying bed and magic sounds insane, but Im glad Walt gave the approval to go ahead with the movie. It actually works, dont ask me how =)<br />  In this DVD, Disney has gone allout and included 2 great cartoon shorts with Donald Duck and Mickey. You also get some behind the scenes footage and info on the movie and if that wasnt enough Disney has thrown all sorts of cut footage back into the movie. While I admit that some of the extra footage makes the movie drag, it also makes you love the movie more because you can appreciate what they were trying to do. So, if you can look past one of the worst acted german armies ever, your gonna find one heck of a treasure. Every Disney DVD should be this high quality! Dont let your kids grow up without seeing this...<br />FILM HIGHLIGHTS<br />My favorite part of the movie has to be on the island of Naboombu. The soccer game between the good and bad animals on the Island is so creative, funny and entertaining! I love it!<br />Filmed in the 1970's, you have to love the trippy &quot;Willy Wonka&quot; type speacial effects as the bed is flying through London. Its really a nice piece of nostalgia.<br />Everyone from Angela Lansbury, David Tomlinson to the adorable children are perfectly cast!
B000002GHH|5.0|One thing that can be said about John Hiatt's &quot;Bring the Family&quot; album is that words really cannot do it justice.  Lyrically and musically it is just stunning.  This terrific album was recorded in only four days with a dream of a band backing him up (Ry Cooder on guitar, Nick Lowe on bass, and Jim Keltner on drums).  A great album is at hand when there are no tracks that are skipped and when the album ends you feel a sense of urgency to listen to it again.  This album is that good.  There aren't any songs that are better than the other.  Each track is solid perfection.  From the soulful groove that kicks off &quot;Memphis in the Meantime&quot; to the last notes of &quot;Learning How to Love You&quot; there is not one bad second.  No serious music afficianado should leave this album out of their collection.  This is a masterpiece.

0060278269|5.0|This book continues the story of Lirael. Before reading this book you might first want to read Lirael the book that comes before this one. In Lirael you find out a lot about Lirael and who she is and where she comes from. Lirael lives in the Old Kingdom, a place filled with magic and mystery. The Old kingdom is ruled by King Touchstone and the Abhorsen Queen, Sabriel. An abhorsen is a person that protects innocents by putting dead spirits, raised by Necromancers, people who bring the dead back to life, back to rest again. In Lirael you find out that Lirael, a daughter of the Clayr, a group of seers, is really Sabriel's half sister. In Lirael there is a Necromancer named Hedge who is digging up something very evil. Lirael is trying to stop him, but is having trouble because of conflicts with other dead creatures. The story ends with a cliffhanger, but starts up again in Abhorsen. Abhorsen starts out with Lirael and her nephew, Sam, trapped in her house, surrounded by thousands of dead hands, dead bodies that have been infused with other dead spirits, controlled by a Necromancer, in this case one of the Greater dead, named Chlorr. This story continues the tale of Lirael and her quest to stop Hedge, from digging up the evil thing, at any cost, with the help from familiar characters such as the Disreputable Dog, Mogget, and a few others.<BR>The author does a very good job at describing events, people, and places in the book. At one point he is describing a dwarf that is paddling in a stream. \\"His skin was a white as bone, and the hair on his head was whiter still, so white it shone in the darkness, even under the shadow of the trees where they overhung the water.\\" The author also explains the place where Hedge is digging with the help of thousands of dead hands. Nix describes how the ground is covered with mud from being trampled on over and over by the feet of dead creatures, and how the dead bodies' joints creak and crack with every movement and how the flesh hangs off the old bones and smells so putrid. He also describes how there are black clouds overhead, attracted by the evil in the ground, and how lighting strikes at alternating intervals, sometimes burning the dead bodies to ashes. <BR>Nix also does a good job at developing characters and showing their inner thoughts and how they change over the entire story. At one point in the story Lirael is very depressed when she must take up a role she wasn't really ready for, but she faces her doubts and fears about it and becomes determined to overcome these and succeed. Also you see the development of Sam as he faces both mental and physical obstacles that threaten to bring him down.<BR>I enjoyed this book very much. I think Garth Nix did a wonderful job with the descriptions in this story; I could picture each person and place so clearly. I also this Nix did a wonderful job at keeping this story in context with the other two books in this series, Sabriel and Lirael. I also feel that Nix did a great job at developing the plot and characters throughout the whole story, making it engaging and keeping the reader enticed and on their toes through the whole thing.

B000003TA4|3.0|Like a lot of other people who have reviewed this album, I really dont understand why this album is so great. Lyrics on the songs are ok thats about the only thing worth buying it for. Kurt a good guitarist.....yeah ok sure. If you want to here some real guitar playing try tool, mudvayne, PINK FLOYD, or Pantera. I too am also glad this so-called revolutionary band is gone. I dont really consider them influential. I play guitar and I never consider Nirvana to be some to look up to. Please think twice before getting this album.
B000068OSK|5.0|This album kicks serious butt. Great driving music. I didn't hear of them until I actually saw them live. Great show. All three albums are suburb. Can't wait for the fourth.
B00004Z459|3.0|This band is definetly a rap/rock band, which has definetly gotten really old. Its lyrics are decent but the &quot;singer&quot; of the group sounds like savage garden or something ( kind of weak when speaking of rock music). He definetly could never compare to Phil Anselmo(Pantera), Chud(Mudvayne), or Maynard(Tool). This band is definetly the best band out of the rap/rock groups. If your into this genre alot go get the album, but otherwise stick to a real band.
B000001ESF|5.0|&quot;2112&quot;, I must say, is definitely Rush's first ultimate masterpiece. They have conjured up a very significant blend of progressive rock with ballad moments, and stringed them all together to create one of rock music's most outstanding pieces of work. The title track, based on the novel &quot;Anthem&quot; by Ayn Rand, vividly describes a futuristic society in which all domains are dominated by the priests of the Temples of Syrinx, who are for all things bright and glorious, and against the use of music. The young, unnamed hero discovers a guitar, and ultimately the priests banish him from the face of the Earth. The hero hopes that the Solar Federation will one day disintegrate, thereby letting everyone know about his accomplishments. The track had to be cut down short on live tours due to time restraints, and on &quot;All The World's A Stage&quot; they omitted &quot;Discovery&quot; (except for the last bit) and &quot;Oracle: The Dream&quot;, then in the 80s they narrowed it down further to &quot;Overture&quot; and &quot;The Temples Of Syrinx&quot;, and it wasn't until the Test For Echo tour that it was performed in its entirety for the first time after 20 years!<br />Other tracks on the album include other often-heard-live tidbits &quot;A Passage To Bangkok&quot; and &quot;Something For Nothing&quot; which display their hard-rock prowess, and provide the album with additional hits. The remaining half never achieved the popularity of the others, being mostly self-written compositions by Alex Lifeson (&quot;Lessons&quot;) and Geddy Lee (&quot;Tears&quot;).<br />Nevertheless, this album is a classical masterpiece, and one would not do good in excluding it from one's Rush collection. Once you listen to it and try to compare it to one of their later works, you would notice a significant change in style and music. The power trio were advised following their ill-fated &quot;Caress Of Steel&quot; venture that in order to achieve more credit they should cut down ontime lengths. But the band rejected it and, as Neil Peart pointed out, they &quot;came back with a vengeance&quot;, resulting in the powerful, 20-and-a-half-minute track which occupied a whole side on its own, displaying their unique capabilities of constructing something quite extraordinary. For Rush, life in the 70s must have been quite different compared with that in the 80s and 90s. They were sort of way ahead of their time, although recording this back in 1976, they made a significant influence on other bands. Keep on rocking, Rush!
B00000099Y|5.0|Oh come on man, you must listen to papa roach or linkin park right?? Tool bland......fair from the truth, they are the most unique bands to date. Their music has so many different meanings I dont think that anyone will ever be able to figure what Maynard really means. This band is so awesome I have seen them in concert at least four or five times, it was definetly an experience. Gimics.... no no no its not about gimics its about the song following the interludes to songs just make the album flow together and sound complete. Please go get this cd, ignore the ignorant reviews written.
B000089A07|3.0|Red Dragon is actually a remake of the 80's Michael Mann version of this story.  So I had the characters already set as to my expectations, and Manhunter did a beautiful job with the story to begin with.  I'm sure that is what hurt this film for me.  It certainly wasn't the casting or the story.  This version was a little more 'splashy' than the gritty nature of Manhunter, and the grit I think helped the original movie more than this did.<br />Fiennes was a surprising Dollarhyde.  He is truly one of the most gifted screen actors we have.  Hopkins is too identified with Lector to not like him, even though his part is scant.  Even Norton, who can't seem to fail at a part, gives Will Graham a vulnerability much different than William Peterson's original.<br />I think the casting gives you most of an expecation for a 'bigger' film, which this story can't be.  I just felt that the casting and manner the story was told in Manhunter 'fit' better than this one.
B00005B36H|5.0|How dare someone would say that a tool album isnt good. They are the most unique and best band to ever come out. Every song on this Cd is an experience in itself. Also, why the hell are people comparing Malmsteen to Tool?? Thats just stupid, its not like tool ever said they wanted to sound like wussies. They arent an 80's band anyways so think about it. Please be smart and get this album.
0761119752|5.0|Pajama Time, by Sandra Boynton, must be one of the best bedtime books around!  Our son is two months old, and most evenings his dad reads him Pajama time. The clever rhymes and colorful characters inspire plenty of smiles and giggles.  This book is a must-have for every child!
014028009X|5.0|Everyone has been going on about the film in my office recently, saying how funny it was and how close to the book it was portrayed. Well, being a cheapskate (and not wanting to visit the cinema alone) I bought the book from Amazon ... and settled down to read it. Wow, what a blinder, I've never read a book in 3 days, but at 300 pages it was very light and quick but extremely funny. I know a few of the basics about being a 30 something and being a `singleton/smug married' and a lot of the scenarios are very true. <br />`Based on Helen Fielding's diary in the Independent newspaper (something I didn't know), this is a novel about a year in the life of a single girl on an optimistic but doomed quest for self-improvement and Inner Poise.' Yeah, right! They've published my diary - the swines! I never even let my mother read my diary, now everyone knows what I get up to! <br />Seriously, if you've not picked up this book, borrow it, steal it or if you really have to - buy the ... thing, but you really need to read it (and that goes for the guys to!). The story is about Bridget, her friends Shazzer, Jude, Tom, Magda, her relationship with and between her mother and father (the storyline around these two is ingenious) and her quest to find a man and enjoy him.... for a while anyway. Despair, self-doubt, obsession and the use of really bad/good self help books are the way to go for Bridget, something of course I've never felt or used ;+). <br />This book goes from strength to strength, it keeps urging you to turn the pages, and even if it is just to see how many cigarettes she's smoked the next day! But the thing is, if I tell you all the bits that made me laugh out loud, it'll ruin the book, so I'm not going to! But wait for the time when she cooks the `blue soup', hilarious! In my mind I had Kate Winslet playing Bridget, Joanna Lumley playing the mother, and Hugh Grant playing Mr Darcy not Colin Firth. But as I've not seen it yet I'll not compare. <br />Apparently, this isa reworking of `Pride and Prejudice', not having read that book yet I can't confirm or deny, but if it's anything like this little belter it's next on my list. I'm reading the sequel at the mo, it's longer, has more swear words and the beginning is ab fab! <br />One criticism is that she doesn't describe finding any grey hairs, now EVERYONE knows that you get paranoid about those - maybe she doesn't have them, <br />All in all, even though it's a quick read, I loved it, I went straight into Waterstones to buy the sequel `The Edge of Reason', and as soon as I've got enough courage to visit the cinema on my own, I'll be there!
B00006LLNV|5.0|This cd will just blow your mind. It features newer artists like lila downs and old mexico type of artists that play traditional mexican music (not the usual norteno/ranchera) it is an emotional and colorful album and it is so amazing...it is very rich culturally...you will want to listen to these hauntingly beautiful songs over and over again. the soundtrack embodies everything frida was as a person, a painter, a female, a wife, a lover, a political figure...everything. it is sad, angry, happy drunk, crying, powerful,BEAUTIFUL.If you are a Frida fan, or just enjoy traditional Mexican music, or are trying to get into your hispanic/latin culture more(as I am)then I highly recommend this album!!
B00005JL78|4.0|Minority Report <br />Washington DC 2054 <br />A special \\"PreCrime\\" police unit no longer has to solve crimes. A battery farm of humans (\\"precogs\\") who dream of future murders identify perpetrators BEFORE they commit the crime. The skill the police have to use is to identify the locations and people in the visions and get there before the crime takes place, whereupon the would be perp is promptly arrested and incarcerated for the crime they haven't yet had time to complete. <br />The program based only in Washington has become popular enough to go National. Outside political forces are taking an interest and looking for flaws in the system. <br />Lead PreCrime cop John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is your typical troubled cop, he lives in a messy apartment, has certain habits that would curtail his pension and has major family issues. He is estranged from his wife, his son disappeared some six years earlier. His superiors are after his badge. Whilst reviewing the latest mureder visions his life takes a more complicated turn when they show John Anderton himself committing the murder... <br />He hears of \\"Minority Reports\\", precog visions that could contradict the ones for which he is being pursued. To get to it and the truth Anderton must break into his old workplace. <br />Anderton has to escape arrest by his colleagues and, like many a hapless fugitive before him, clear his name... <br />---------------------------------------- <br />Spielberg and Cruise, almost as big a box office come on as Cruise and the Mission Impossible theme music a few years ago... <br />To me, though, the bonus is the above two PLUS that Minority Report is derived from a short story from quirky SF author Philip K. Dick (Bladerunner). Movie cat-nip. I'm there. <br />The \\"yeah, right\\" plot is explained as painlessly as possible and one is quite happy to suspend disbelief. The detail is the beauty, like another Philip K. Dick project, \\"Total Recall\\" the minutae of life in 2054 is happily paraded before us, generally in a very subtle manner. Product placement is another matter and we are belaboured with it, but somehow it has a believable absurdity, the joke is on the advertiser, as billboards identify you by retinal scan and begin to pitch to you personally. This could well be the future of America, and don't be too smug, UK, you're going that way too. <br />The action scenes are eye popping with jet pack powered police units whizzing merrily in pursuit of escapees dangling from gravity defying vehicles on vertical interstates. <br />The plot? Well you've seen it before as \\"The Fugitive\\", but the end game defies one's expectations in some delightfully twisty ways. Those cop cliches are used to the benefit of the plot, although I think the villain is exactly who you'd expect it to be from the outset, despite those herrings that are red in colour. <br />Another bonus, this is a surprisingly funny film from Spielberg, with a sense of humour reminiscent of Total Recall and Fifth Element. Peter Stormare relishes every second as a snotty back street eyeball identity fraudster that crosses paths with Cruise in one squirm inducing sequence. Dubliner Colin Farrell earns the acting plaudits as the cop after Anderton's badge and a brief eye catching turn by Lois Smith as a deranged geneticist. Alas, everyone else is just background noise really. Poor Jessica Harper doesn't even get a line of dialogue. <br />Cinematography by Spielberg regular Janusz Kaminski is a little grainy, deliberately to hide the seams on the plethora of visual effects? Or just a style? Make your own mind up. And count 'em eleven special effects companies contributing to the seamless look of the thing. <br />So ultimately, action, technology, humour and even a little mind food too. <BR>No Bladerunner, I'm afraid, but this is the best blockbuster sci-fi to turn up since, well, Bladerunner. <BR>Go see on the big screen with an audience.
B000069HK2|5.0|my friend andy told me to listen to the used.  i told him no.  he made me listen to taste the ink and i wasnt impresed at all.  i waited like, 2 weeks and after seeing the music video for buried myself alive, i decided to check out the used by myself.  i couldnt get buried myself alive out of my head for 3 days.  thats no lie.  i continued to listen to it and i just fell in love with it.  absolutely beautiful music.  i love most music(except maybe the donnas) and i can tell you theres none better out there than the used right now.
B0000025D0|5.0|I was in high school when I first heard this album. It was the first one in my experience that addressed growing up, maturing, having to face real life adult situations. <BR>Bruce was on the verge of (gasp!) 30 when it came out and the maturity shows. There will always be a place for fun, fun, fun, to rock and roll all nite and party every day, but the time comes when that can't be your primary occupation anymore. That phase of life ends, and what you have to do when you get up in the morning then is what this album is about. <BR>This is darker than 'Born to Run' if by darker you mean less optimistic. Compare 'Racing in the Streets' to 'Thunder Road'. It's also about carrying on, dealing with relationships that aren't working, with a life that you don't like very much. It's hard to believe that this music was written by a rock star; he certainly never forgot what life was like before stardom, and what his life might have been if that stardom had never happened.<BR>It's not a downer, even though I'm making it sound like it. Life can be hard, but it's always worth living, and this is an outstanding album that is one of Springsteen's very best.
B000059ZT4|5.0|The reasons for that are simple, really. Not only does this version of Catch A Fire contain the alternate non-overdubbed tracks that truly show just how great the songs were in a stripped-down setting, there is also the welcome addition of two bonus tracks that were curiously left off the original album (the one the Wailers presented to producer Chris Blackwell upon completion of the initial recording sessions) for what I now consider to be questionable reasons. Add to that an outstanding remastering job and one can't help but think that the inclusion of the 2nd disc containing the album as it was originally released to the public (the one with the overdubs and no bonus tracks) was mere bonus material. In other words, don't bother getting the individual remastered version of Catch A Fire and get the deluxe edition instead. The Jamaican version is a revelation and IMHO should've been the album released in the first place.
B00005JM93|4.0|Told in reverse chronological order, IRREVERSIBLE follows two men through the streets of France in an effort to seek revenge on the man who had brutally raped and beaten their dear friend and lover, Alex. There is no mistake that this film is both clever and violent. Moving from extreme depravity to bittersweet serenity, this film is likely to affect the viewer long after they have left the theatre. I cringed and wiggled in my seat during the scenes of extreme violence, but the nine-minute rape scene particularly affected me. Being a woman this scene touched on one of my ultimate fears of being sodomised and beat into a coma. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination; everything is put on the wide screen to digest regardless of the audience's wishes. I believe IRREVERSIBLE is a highly original film that speaks volumes to the limits one would go to correct a wrong. There's lots of substance in this film and is worth a second viewing if only I could fast-forward through the violence. Definately not for those with a weak stomach or delicate senses. I believe if one is able to sit through the gore, they will walk away with a renewed sense of humanity.
B00003CXB4|5.0|My son is three years old and he loves this movie. He has to watch every day all day. He memorize every word in this film. He knows the movie so well that he can read the book to you with no assistance--just by looking at the pages. There is no skipping a page in the book with him. He knows exactly where you missed the page and when turn back to it. I watch the movie so many times in the day that I love it. He loves Simba Pride as well. I brought him almost every character in the movie because he likes to act it out while the movie is playing. There are no hyenas availbale for sale. This is a wonderful animated movie. I recommend this movie for kids of all ages.
0393317552|4.0|Previous reviewers have explored the author's thesis that geography has shaped history through its effects upon evolution of societies and biota.  My review will focus on the author's comments regarding religion, and particularly Christianity.<br />I found this book enlightening and humbling because despite my best efforts, I can't entirely avoid a taint of ethnocentrism in my worldview.  I've been well aware of the crimes through which America gained its wealth and power, but at the same time, I've been proud of our many noble accomplishments.  I've been distressed at the incongruity between Christianity's positive effects within our society, and its simultaneous role in encouraging our country to sin against less-powerful peoples for our own benefit.  Slavery, the Mexican Wars, and the Indian genocides are only a few examples.<br />For this reason, the author's comments on religion are useful.  He notes that as larger, better-organized states arose to exploit resources, rulers used religion to strengthen ethnic identity and justify aggressive wars.  This was the way of the world for millennia: stronger states robbed and enslaved their weaker neighbors without apology, and religion was usually secular power's cheerleader.  Because of this book, I see now that Christianity's ambivalent role in American is nothing new in the world of religion.<br />What's outrageous about this role is that Christ came to change all that.  As Paul said, in Christ there is neither slave nor free, Jew or gentile.  We're supposed to be Christians first, and citizens of our respective polities second.  I believe that Christianity started to go off this track when Constantine made it Rome's state religion.  Although we owe secular authority considerable obedience, that obedience does not include giving preference to our own polities' interests over others'.  Clearly, in those areas where our Christian faith touches upon relationships with other countries, we've lapsed into religion's traditional role of being secular power's lapdog rather than its watchdog.
B0000584V3|5.0|This is my first Opeth CD and may I say that I fell in love with it upon my first listen. The reason I got into this band was because my friend downloaded an Opeth song for me and though I don't remember the name, I knew that a band who could write an 11 and a half minute song which continualy was great had to have a lot of talent. I was right. Blackwater Park is nothing short of breathtakingly incredible, each song written with such ingenuity, uniquness and  sheer beauty. The acoustic licks and riffs will have to deeply enchanted, the hard distorted guitar riffs will have you headbanging, and the kickass clean and crisp guitar solo's will have you airguitaring to no end. The lyrics are all beautiful poetry to say the least, these guys can write words just as well as they can write music.<BR>This bands music is very unique; it's death metal/black metal, progressive rock, folk acoustics all intertwined in each song. Each song runs an average of about 10 minutes in length, which may seem like a lot, but it works the same as an amazing film, you're so immersed in its beauty you feel like it's so much shorter then it really is. Listening to this record is like reading your favorite novel, or watching your favorite movie, or reliving your most cherished memory, you can add this one to your list. <BR>This is the first album I recommend to anyone wanting to get into this band, sure their other works are all incredible, but this one just has something special to it. To me, this record is the definitive Opeth, all their styles are spared evenly throughout this record. It is sad though that a lot of people will be too ignorant to hear this. I was telling my little sister for example about Opeths music, and she was turned off as soon as I mention the average length of their songs. Meanwhile she likes [stuff] like Korn, LimP Bizkit, Staind and Fuel. Great music requires patience people, it's not fast food! It's a sacred art that's been corrupted since corporate record labels discovered how easy and cheap it is to make a quick buck with America's ignoramous fast-paced lifestyle tastes. Those people on this webpage who are giving this 1 star reviews, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING HARD ENOUGH, give the record a few more spins and I guarantee you'll appreciate it, if not, go to the doctor to have your ears checked!<BR>So in closing I just want to say that if you're a true fan of genuinely great rock/metal music (not some dumb poseur), do yourself a HUGE favor and buy this record, or any Opeth record for that matter because I know they're all as great as this one, or download thier songs, something! There aren't very many (hardly any at all) great rock/metal bands out there anymore and when they're gone you'll have missed your chance, so go out and get your hands on some Opeth.
0553296981|5.0|In the story of Anne Frank I learned that life is a gife from God and that we should have fun with life.We should not kill other lifes because of their religion. We should love each and everything that is on the earth.You see in this story a little girl writs in her diary about the outside world.The time when Jews were not liked very much. She was a Jew and Hitler did not like the Jews.So he murder the Jews,because he thought that the people with white skin and blue colored eyes was the superior race.Anne writes about the every day things that she has to do in order to stay alive,but she keeps much hope.She can not talk to her outside friends,because she has went into hinding.Now she is having more and more fights with her mom.She is also getting into fights with her dad.At the age of around 13-17 girls&boys start to think that they know everything and that their parents just fell out the sky.Lets not  get into details.Anne lives in hinding for 2 years and 3 months.As the second year comes around more things start to happen.One of these things leads up to the time of Anne and the last days that she would see her family again.So let this be a lesson to you.Take life by the hand and live.Thank you for reading and God Bless.
B000002JR8|3.0|Now, I'm not really a Pantera fan, I bought this record from some advice from a friend. I do really like metal though, and I like this record too. Upon first listen, the record started off great with the first track &quot;Strength beyond Strength.&quot; The song was great to say the least. I basically was really into the first half of a record, then after track 6 &quot;Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks&quot; I just became somewhat bored with it. I really felt these guys could have done more with the variety in these songs. A lot of them are basic riff after riff with no thrashing solo's or guitar harmonics working together, and no real rhythem either; to not sound like I absolutely hated these songs (because I didn't) I should just say they were... ok songs, nothing I havent really heard before.<BR>Now these guys are capable of writing great songs with lots of solo's and harmonics because some songs on this record(the good ones,mostly first half) have all these elements in them. I'm sure any Pantera fan would love this record and all Pantera's records, I can see why, but my individual style and taste doesnt go that far in terms of this band. I would say if you're paying 15 bucks for this CD then you're really only getting about 8 bucks worth of good music. So if you're just getting into this band, I'd just recommend buying it used like I did.
B000002P2V|5.0|Raw, acid-tongued, and repleat with ... and vinegar, full of the take-that-Sex-Pistols, attitude.  Growing old ain't easy, particularly with the perception of the music world on your skinny shoulders, as Townshend felt.  But to not roll over to the Disco fad of the times, he and The Who grab music by the scruff of the neck for a good shaking on this album.  From the opening salvo of \\"New Song\\" this album kicks into gear.  I feel the only low point is \\"Love is Coming Down\\", small gripe, but you can get no more ornery than this album.  <br />I also continue to be amazed at how Daltrey takes Townshend's anger into his voice and channels an equal amount of disgust in his delivery - kudos to Daltrey, an underrated singer of any generation.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|After reading all the reviews on this board, I rushed right out and rented \\"Donnie\\" and watched it with my girlfriend.  Strangely, when it was all over I was markedly undecided about it, but she, who prefers historical realism like \\"Gangs of New York\\"-type films, loved it.  We both compared it throughout to \\"Heathers\\" and \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\" in its surrealistic portrayal of high school life.  I watched it again with the first commentary track with the director and Jake Gyllenhaal, and all was made clear.  A lot of our assumptions turned out to be incorrect (which is also true of some other reviews on this board) but I love movies that can be interpreted in different ways and require multiple viewings to see all the clues and story nuances.  After listening to the commentary, now I can't get the movie out of my head and I talk about it all the time.<br />I agree with others that for a small budget, this film is shot beautifully.  The acting is superb, of course, with Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze (who all worked for pocket change, another testament to a great script), and especially newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal. The music is great too, adding great power to some scenes similar to the soundtrack in \\"Rushmore\\".  The extras on the DVD are pretty good, for such a small budget.  There are a huge number of (mostly forgettable with a few exceptions) deleted scenes, but the funniest bonus is the \\"Cunning Visions\\" infomercial with commentary.<br />I would absolutely recommend this, but only if you can listen to the commentary to appreciate fully what is going on.

B000089RVX|1.0|I'm embarassed that I own this album. Sorry, everybody. This is puerile, regurtitated cliche angst for the Tori-meets-Linkin-Park generation. Amy's voice is absolutely beautiful, yes, but the lyrics are cracking me up in a not-so-very-funny way. As it happens, the Daredevil soundtrack got the best of Evanescence's work.
B00005S8FC|5.0|wow, wow, wow! gotan project is amazing. i'd heard a few tracks on various collections and was intriqued by them so i finally decided to go ahead and order this cd. i was in no way prepared though for the delicious sounds found in the case. it's 12 monkeys grown up and ready to get on with life. they've taken instruments i've always laughed at, i.e. the accordian (only thought it was good for a polka), and turned them into the most beautiful music makers i could dream of. not one single note on this cd is mediocre, it's all perfectly splendid. just go out and by it now. your ears DEFINITELY deserve it.
0812550757|4.0|All right, so you've read Ender's Game.  You loved it, you loved everything about it.  You want more.  You rush to the bookstore to find Speaker for the Dead.  One small problem: Speaker for the Dead is nothing like Ender's Game.<br />Ender's Game was a story about a boy and his growth and struggle through the tough times at Battle School, and the war he fights without knowing it's real.<br />Speaker is set about 3,000 years later.  Ender's about 30, this made possible by some quirk of interstellar travel.  As a Speaker for the Dead, he comes to Lusitania to speak the death of several people, members of the family intimately connected with the pequininos, the indigenous aliens dubbed the Portuguese equivalent of \\"piggies\\".  Together with Jane, the sentient computer, the sleeping Hive Queen, and the help of his sister Valentine several light-years away, Andrew (as he now calls himself) must puzzle his way through the deaths and the whys of Novinha's tempestuous family.<br />It's a good book, but it's a lot different from Ender's Game.  Fans of that genre may not like Speaker as much.  A good alternative is to read Ender's Shadow, the parallel novel about Bean, set at roughly the same time as Ender's Game.  Either way, you get an excellent book.
0783226063|4.0|The David Lynch movie version of Dune came out in 1984. This was the first time that the very famous Dune series by Frank Herbert had been adapted for screen, and legions of fans waited eagerly to see how it would work out. Many were thrilled, many were disappointed. It's only really now, with a 6 hour miniseries out on the same subject, that many people are viewing this movie attempt fairly.<br />First, the movie was only 2 hours and 17 minutes long. That's an incredibly short period of time for such a long, complex book. Even the six hour miniseries had to leave key scenes out and combine characters together. So any complaints about missing scenes or favorite characters has to take that into account.<br />Kyle MacLachlan is Paul Atreides, and Jurgen Prochnow (one of my *favorite* actors) is his father, Duke Leto. Some criticize the two for being non-emotional. If you read the series, however, you'll find that this is true to form. Neither of these men were ones to show how they felt. They were raised in the rough world of hard-core politics and daily death threats. The story of Dune is about Duke Leto's hardest time of a hard life - being forced to move to a planet he hates, to put his beloved wife and son directly into danger. Paul's life isn't much better. If anything, I give HUGE credit to the scriptwriters for keeping Paul intelligent and mature throughout the movie, just as he was in the book. The miniseries turns Paul into a sniveling, whiny brat and this drove me CRAZY. That was NOT Paul.<br />The backup actors are fantastic. You have Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard), Dean Stockwell, Sean Young, Linda Hunt, Jose Ferrer, and many others. They do a great job of trying to get a character across in the short time they have to do it in.<br />The visual style is very engaging. Their stillsuits look like STILLSUITS quite unlike the miniseries turning them into beachwear. The rich Gothic architecture really gives a sense that this culture has existed for thousands of years and has been taking advantage of the power it had.<br />At least one reviewer has said *incorrectly* that the DVD has scenes cut. In fact, the DVD is the exact same version as the theatrical release. There was a *TV* release that was severely cut to fit into TV-time, and Lynch hated that version so much he refused to allow his name to be put on it.<br />I admit that I used to be a critic of this movie. But seeing what others did to the content of this amazing book even with much more time to work with, I have to now admit that Lynch squashed an amazing amount of quality into his just-over-two-hours. I would recommend that anyone who finds the concept of Dune even slightly interesting to definitely READ THE BOOK and then watch the movie with that background in mind.of years and has been taking advantage of the power it had.<br />At least one reviewer has said *incorrectly* that the DVD has scenes cut.

B000084T18|5.0|Since the first time that I heard this guy dis Ja Rule, I fell in love with him (not the kind of love like I want to have his babies or nuttin). Like anything that Shady-Aftermath has touched lately, it's a classic. Is 50 gonna be the \\"next\\" big thing? I doubt it, but this album is huge. There's not a flat track anywhere. Em sounds great wid 50 on a couple tracks, and the 12-degree pink belt on \\"back down\\" is hilarious (a solid Ja Rule dis). <br />50 is a great up-and-comer who doesn't fit into the made-for-radio hip-hop that is being produced. There aren't many tracks that are radio quality (thank God!!!). For that thug noise that many of us are looking for, you don't have to go diggin for any underground muzik... it's all right here. 50 brings a real sense to gansta rap, forget all the talk, he's a true badass.
0441172717|5.0|I've been a fan of Dune for as long as I can remember. It was a book series I avidly enjoyed while growing up, and its thoughts on enviromentalism and how long, small changes can make a big difference have always stuck with me.<br />This is definitely a book that gets better and better each time you read it. You can read it at age 12 and think it's a great story of a young boy growing up, how he grows and changes and matures as a result of all of the things he goes through. You can read it at 20 and think it's a great book about environmentalism - how changes to a planet and its ecosystem have wide-ranging effects that can be disastrous. And as you continue to read it, you catch all of the subtle nuances - the way people treat each other, how communication and trust can make and destroy lives, how desire for love, desire for power, desire for wealth, desire for knowledge, all shape humans.<br />Some people label this book as 'science fiction' - and it is in the sense that it occurs in a galaxy that has space travel, where technologies unknown to us are in use. But in a grander sense it is about human drama - how humans react to the situations they're in, how their passions drive them, how they think and feel and relate to each other.<br />Yes, there are terms to learn and ideas to understand. This is true whether you're reading a book about the aborigines of Australia or mountain climbing in the Himalayas. It's not something you need to obsess over, constantly checking glossaries. Like in any book, simply read the book from start to end and get absorbed into the culture. The terms will make sense, the personalities will reveal themselves.<br />Some have said the book has characters that are good or evil. I actually find that the MOVIES did this, but the books are extremely good at layering the many shades of grey. People always have motives for what they do and feel that their motives are perfectly justified. Some motives are compassionate, some motives are self serving. Very much like real life.ving. Very much like real life.
0375414053|3.0|Loved some of the one liners but ultimately felt betrayed with the ending (which I wont give away!)  She definitely captures the chaos of trying to do it all and the strain of young kids on a marriage.  Some of the relationships with co-workers (especially when hatching their scheme) in the book are a stretch also.  Good for some laughs but wait until it is available in paperback to save some $$.

B00008GKEG|5.0|As the bombs fell over England in 1940, John Winston Lennon was born and as war raged, Sir James Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Richard Starkey a.k.a. Ringo Starr began their young lives in a dirty port city called Liverpool. They were mostly poor boys who today are legends.<br />The most interesting thing from the TV special in 1995, the 3 albums that followed and the 8 VHS tapes that expanded the story was the fact that it was \\"The Beatles\\" in their own words and recollections.<br />There's so much packed inside this story and safe to say, so much more we don't know, that it is engrossing each time you watch it. The interweaving of outtakes, never before heard songs and footage is beautiful. George Martin's emotional talk and tears as he remembers John Lennon is heartwrenching. You see here the strength of the four lads from Liverpool, the closeness of their friendship and those involved with them.<br />The DVD version is jammed with more than the 8 VHS tapes and elevates the \\"Anthology\\" to a rounder story. At the time of its initial release, there were 3 surviving Beatles, sadly now there are 2. One sit through of this is not enough for you are sure to miss elements. As timeless as The Beatles themselves, so is their story and this anthology.<br />Robert Eldridge (...)

B00006JJ1O|5.0|I am not going to spend time praising this cd, as it has been praised by many before me for its controversial lyrics and smooth beautiful music.  I just want to address the negative reviews saying that Tatu's music and act were created for them by the American Trevor Horn.  Being Russian, it offends me to read such a review.  For your information, the Russian version of &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; (Ya Soshla S Uma) came out in Russia in 2000 - 3 years ago - before anyone had ever heard of the girls, followed by an album in 2001.  And let me assure you that the music in all of the Russian songs from 2 and 3 years ago is identical to the English version today, only the words have been translated.  So unless Trevor Horn or someone else travelled to Russia 3 years ago and wrote music and albums for unknown 15 and 16 year-old, it should be obvious that the music is indeed the creation of the Tatu girls themselves. I would recommend for everyone to find the original Tatu songs in Russian and enjoy the experience in their native language - the songs do not lose their beauty and only gain mysticism.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I'll assume you've seen STAR WARS, or at least you're familiar with it. Suppose that STAR WARS was available only in a severly mutilated version shortened by a quarter, omitting key plot elements regarding the relationship of Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and Obi Wan Kenobi. Then for whatever reason portions of the dialog were rewritten, redubbed and the John Williams score was replaced with generic classical selections, or perhaps a contemporary rock score. To add insult to injury, let's suppose that even this mutilated version is only seen in blurry, faded and sometimes unwatchable prints. Well, that's precisely the treatment that Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS has received over the years. The new restoration gives fans of science fiction film, silent film, german expressionist film, classic film music and the magic of the cinema reason to rejoice! Though, sadly, the portions which were cut seem to be irretrievable, the remaining elements have been restored using state-of the art techniques and re-edited into their proper sequence with the original title cards. The results are accompanied by the stirring score prepared for the film's premiere in the 1920's and the final presentation is nothing short of breathtaking. I've seen the film many times over the years and watching this restoration is like seeing it for the first time.
B000084T18|3.0|Why all the hype?  Is it because of his association with Eminem?  Honestly, the album has some hot tracks, no doubt, but basically that's because of the beats.  50's lyrics are pretty simplistic that stick to the same subject matter as 90 percent of the other rappers he's competing with for your $$$.  <BR>  This is not a classic album by any stretch of the means.  Look, I know that rap still hadn't reached it's pinnacle for commercial exposure back in the mid to late 90's when 50 made the clever \\"How to Rob,\\" but that song, which was much better than any song on this album (yeah. . .I said it) didn't gain hardly any exposure (except the attention of some of the people he offended).  <BR>  What do we learn from this boys and girls?  With the right marketing and a renewed emphasis on explicit violence ANYONE can become a household name over night.  Just ask 50 who destroyed Billboard records one week at a time.<BR>  I give the album 4.5 stars on the beats and production, but 1.5 stars on subject matter (or lack there of).  Decent debut, not a classic like so many others claim, but then most people would rather follow the mainstream anyway, just look at 50's record sales.

0385335482|5.0|I got Confessions of a Shopoholic from the library on Monday and finished it in one day. The next day I left school early and ran out and bought not only the next two, Shopoholic takes Manhattan and Shopoholic ties the knot, but Confessions of a Shopoholic as well. I immediately sped home, locked myself in my room and by staying up till 3:15 in the morning finished the next two books during the same night. I can't tell you enough how fabulous all three of these books are. Everyone can in some way relate to Becky and her adventures are sooo funny that you won't put this book down until you have finished it. Now I am just depressed because there are no more of her books for me to read. PLEASE let there be one more sequel!!!!!!!
B000070WJE|2.0|I think this is the worst CD Robbie Williams has released to date. The music is so unappealing. I bought the CD in Europe and I was particularly irritated by the copy protection that won't let you save the CD in your hard disk (this protection should be illegal in the US, right?)--and by the ... euros I had to shell out. Why it is being sold in the US for $... beats me, but I don't think it's worth it, either.
B00003Q43A|1.0|\\"ID4: Independence Day\\" is an example of what's truly wrong with not just American moviemaking, but America today.<br />The now deceased former longshoreman and popular philosopher Eric Hoffer once said, \\"The nature of the American is that he is a hustler.\\"<br />After seeing \\"ID4: Independence Day\\", Hoffer's idea becomes larger than life.  Someone obviously wanted to make a quick buck for their stockholders, and they didn't care how. What was produced in \\"ID4: Independence Day\\" is the cinematic equivalent of junk food.<br />If there's any doubt about that, just try watching this film twice.  It's as if the producers of this film were saying \\"No one ever went broke underestimating the tastes of the American public, so just give us your money.  Up with us and (screw) you!\\"<br />The ridiculous storyline notwithstanding, what makes this film more than annoying is an arrogant display of religious ethnicity: Two of the main characters are portrayed as saintlike beings as a result of their affiliation with a certain faith.  This genre of movie is supposed to mindless camp.  Instead, \\"ID4: Independence Day\\" turns out to be a stab at politically correct mindless camp.<br />Of course, the film was promoted mercilessly.  The vast amount of money that went into the production and promotion of this abortion would have been better served elsewhere...  and I do mean anywhere else.<br />In contrast, the films of the late sixties and seventies were experimental, creative and interesting.  Movies like \\"Little Big Man\\", \\"The French Connection\\", \\"The Godfather\\", and \\"Rocky\\" were all large budget studio films that managed to make a buck, yet still have some integrity.  Today, integrity doesn't count.<br />You don't either.  Just hand over your money.

0060537639|3.0|A mildly amusing read even if it is fictional. A fleet with 10,000 people cruising around virtually the entire globe leaving villages in the New World speaking Chinese, monoliths carved in a uniform fashion at the entrances to many harbors and rearranging the flora and fauna of the continents would probably not go unnoticed by others.<br />The author's relentless claim that the Chinese are cool and nearly everyone else is a distant also-ran is as unmatched to the facts as his many photographs are to the text of his tale. I have never read a book which made a freer use of `darn sure conclusions' from facts which no one else seems to have heard of.<br />The book is fun to read though as was the Fingerprints of the Gods but no less silly.
B00006G8LB|5.0|I thought that Spider-Man was a great movie because of the story and the action. It made me think that someone can step up and be a hero(even if someone has no super powers). I also thought that the characters were handled very well(especially Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson) and that the movie stayed faithful to what made Spider-Man great over the years.<br />I definitely recommend this movie to everyone(even if you're not a comic book fan) .
B00005JKZT|5.0|Okay, the storyline is somewhat different than the trilogy written by J.R.R. Tolkien in the 1930's, it is still without a doubt the best serial movie since the first Star Wars series, if not better.  I discovered Tolkien almost 30 years ago at a garage sale in Texas, and it not only had the trilogy, but his complete writings, including his Son's book The Simirillian.  I was pleased at reading The Hobbit, and that he carried some of the charaters into the trilogy, and was so far ahead of his time, it is unbelievable.<br />In many ways, it is like Steven King's The Gunslinger series (although he has yet to release the final chapter), you will not forget anything you read the year before.  Tolkein has done the same with this series.  And also true to Steven King's novels made into movies, there are few that match up to the book itself, due to the difficulty to portray what each character is actually thinking.  I have read some here who say it is boring, or that it is boring compared to the first movie, if so, then obviously you haven't read the book.  I am certian that the last in the series, it will keep you in suspence and promises to be spellbounding.  If you miss this movie, don't bother to see the last until it is released in DVD or Video, or you will be lost, you must see the whole thing to have the desired effect, it is worth the $8.50 per person to plop down.  If you miss it, it will be your own fault.
B000002TQV|5.0|I have complete albums and most rarities, eps, and singles of Radiohead. Yes, I like Radiohead that much. And for me, 'The Bends' is their best record. Though 'OK Computer' gained good reviews from most critics. I like it because every song is good. I'm lucky cause I bought this cd in Japan and it has bonus tracks. <BR>If I get lost in an island and I could only bring 5 cds, these include 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer', Jeff Buckley's 'Grace', Travis' 'The Man Who', and Chris Cornell's 'Euphoria Morning'.
B00005221M|5.0|I watched this film for the first time 3 weeks ago and it was fantastic, so romantic.  The cinematography (Dante Spinotti) was breathtaking and surprisingly the entire film was perfectly cast (Bonnie Timmermann). <br />I bought the VHS of this film because many of the reviews stated that the Director's Cut was such a deviation from the original.  I did not find this to be the case.  Aside from some dialogue and music that had been edited out, the movie is practically indistinguishable - which leads me to my question - how do you know that there is more footage of Uncas and Alice?  Anyone watching the film is riveted by the strong, quiet performance of Eric Schweig and questions the prominent billing and minimal part of Jodhi May. Nevertheless, the viewer is left with a strong sense that there is indeed something more.  <br />Is there?  Or is it the extremely fine acting that leaves the viewer longing for what should have been for the ill-fated couple?
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I really like these two, and not because they're supposed to be lesbians. It's great to see Russian pop being imported to America, because, frankly, it's better than anything we've got going over here. HOWEVER, I strongly recommend that you buy instead or in addtion to this CD the Russian language version &quot;Dvesti Po Vstrechnoi.&quot; The translations in this CD are a bit awkward and don't do the Russian version justice; even if you don't understand Russian, I think that the songs just sound better. Also, as a Russian student, I found these songs helpful, as they are in relatively simple language and helped me to learn a few new words.
B00004TDTO|2.0|Okay, okay...Jaws, in my opinion, is an okay movie. The plot is fairly interesting, but I've seen a lot of movies and shows about giant animals wreaking havoc so...yeah. ^^;<br />But the reason I dislike this movie is because I'm a shark fan. I adore sharks and just about any other animal that can kill you...*sweatdropps*...Yeah. So the serious \\"shark bashing\\" I saw in his movie sort of made me mad. ^^ Especially since great white sharks are one of my favorite animals.<br />And everyone said, \\"Shark attack! Get out of the water!\\" way too much...x.x...<br />Pros ~<BR>Interesting plot<BR>The shark looked pretty neat<br />Cons ~<BR>Everyone said \\"Shark attack! Get out of the water!\\" too much<BR>Way too much shark bashing...
0066214122|3.0|Great concept, excellent research on behalf of the author and altogether very well put together.  However when writing sci-fi you don't have to assume your audience is stupid and will \\"buy\\" anything and everything you throw at them... and I am not talking about artificial intelligence or animal behavior algorithms, I am talking about common sense.  I felt like screaming \\"wake up and smell the coffee\\" to the main character about 100 time through the course of the book... why he kept getting into so many predicaments that no one \\"logically\\" would, I don't know.  Fiction is not supposed to be totally unrealistic as much as it should be imaginative.  There is a fine line between absurdity and a great story line and Crichton crossed that line many times in his book.<br />The first part of this novel was great! Great setup, outstanding at creating all the necessary suspense... a definite page turner.  The second half just plummets! A one ton brick... over the top, at times stupid and resorting to \\"maybe\\" whatever was on TV when he was writing that chapter.<br />In the end, I enjoyed the book, if anything I should say it was a very quick read.  The story doesn't overwhelm you and there is not much breath of characters, which keeps it simple. The worst part was that I was really looking forward to reading this book and in being completely honest with myself I have to say it let me down... Maybe it won't let you down<br />I can't not recommend this book because it does carry along a certain entertaining value and if nothing else it will be an eye opener to the \\"reality\\" of what is possible with the technology as we think we know it today... scary... yes, very scary and as an IT professional myself I have to say that it is not that far fetched!<br />Cheers!<br />GS
0671027387|4.0|I liked this book. The idea of a techno-thriller involving lots of hard science mixed with political skullduggery really appealed to me. The plot is quite twisted and moves along at a brisk pace, keeping you wondering what in the world is going to happen next.<br /><br />My biggest criticism is that it's hard to take the characters seriously when the author doesn't take them seriously. Almost all of the characters kid around and talk/act like unruly teenagers. At one point the President of the United States steals the main protagonist's mobile telephone! Very funny, but are we supposed to think this is realistic behavior from real adult characters?<br /><br />Despite this problem with the characters I'm looking forward to reading more of Dan Brown's books.<br /><br />Rennie Petersen
B00004YA66|5.0|Why didn't I hear more about this movie before I watched it...??? I don't know. Maybe I was hiding under a rock.<br />This movie has it ALL, action, great sci-fi, romance and that super special father-son bond that was so perfectly caracterized. Acting was phenomenal, great cinematography... it makes you fell as if you were right there at all times.  The concept was infinitely clever and ingeniuosly developed.<br />My macho pride is nor hurt when I admit I cried to this movie... the end was just perfect!<br />Now one of my all time favorite movies.<br />Great flick!  Enjoy.
6305546789|5.0|My family had just gotten cable t.v. when I came across this gem and it frightened me to my very core.I am not ashamed to admit that as a child I was afraid of the dark - growing up in a haunted house might have had something to do with it but thats another story....lol - and this film captured everything I had ever feared and completely destroyed me on all levels.<br />Haddonfield,Illinois in the early sixties,a 5 year old brutally murders his sister with a butcher knife.Sent to a mental hospital until his 21st birthday to face charges as an adult,he escapes and returns to Haddonfield...on October 31 - Halloween.<br />Jamie Lee Curtis plays a young teen who becomes the target of the disturbed murderer.Donald Pleasance is his doctor frantically trying to find him...he knows what he is capable of and must stop him at any cost!!Now the stage is set for one of the best endings in horror film history....the blood is kept to a minimum and it`s whats implied - or not seen - that makes this movie so powerful.John Carpenter made his mark as a director to be reckoned with and elevated the genre to the next level,watch it with the lights out and the sound cranked up and take the trip...if it don`t make you jump at least once your probally dead already.Be afraid.......
B000007OY0|5.0|This is a film about patience, slow moving justice, and a life-long friendship all ending with a very satisfying close to what shapes up to be a wonderful story.  The main character, played by Tim Robbins, is a banker named Andy who's sent to Shawshank Prison on a murder charge, but as he gets to know a life-term prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman), the audience is led to realize the banker's crime was probably justifiable homocide. We also realize that Andy's calm, patience, and fortitude, is more sutible to prison life than his new found friend Red thought. <br />Shawshank Redemption shows that the typical view of a prison film which includes violence, brutality, riots and the sort, should be the only side presented.  It seems that it is typically forgotten that there are also instances of faith, friendship, and survival of an entirely different kind. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film, and deserves the critical acclaim it has received as well as the hearts of the public.
0385504209|5.0|This book is amazing, I haven't finished it yet so I'm hoping it continues this way, but if you have the chance to read it, DO.

B00005M989|4.0|I am a casual Prince fan so this suits me. Prince is a fantastic artist. One of the greats of the last few decades so I definitely understand the more hard-core Prince fans getting ticked off at obvious ommisions. This covers Prince's 80's hits pretty well including the \\"Purple Rain\\" singles \\"When Doves Cry,\\" \\"I Would Die 4 U,\\" and the title track. It also includes Prince standards such as \\"Raspberry Beret,\\" and \\"1999.\\" And who can forget the classic \\"Kiss?\\" I happen to be one of the people that find \\"Get Off\\" oddly amusing so I enjoy the track along with \\"Cream.\\" But I'm happy to see my favorite Prince song of all time on this CD and that is the beautiful ballad \\"Diamonds and Pearls.\\" Prince at his pop best. Even though I find this CD up to my own standards, I definitely think \\"The Most Beautiful Girl In the World\\" should have been included along with maybe \\"Controversy.\\" That would've gotten it 5 stars from me.<br />For people just discovering Prince, or who just like him for the pop hits, this will most likely satisfy. For the bigger fans, I recommend looking elsewhere. :)
B00005JLRT|5.0|I have been a fan of the The Next generation, and when the series hit the movie screen I was excited and disappointed at the same time. The First movie-Star Trek: Generations was an okay movie, following up was Star Trek: First Contact which was a hell of alot better than the previous film. Then Star Trek: Insurrection was a let down and took a different pace compared to First Contact. Now the tenth star trek film-possible final TNG movie. I read all the reviews saying it was bad, looks cheap,etc. I finally decided to see and it was a great, not exactly the greatest movie ever made,but I was a better than star trek 9. Nemesis had one of the best ship battle scenes I have ever seen in a trek movie, as well the chemistry between Shinzon(Hardy) and Picard(Stewart) was excellant.been a bit longer, it seemed that the movie attempted to rush, until the end of the movie. The time when fast when watching the movie. I never generally see a movie more than once but for this one I saw it at least four times. But my disappointment about the movie is that it could have I would recomment this movie to anyone.
B000002HIK|5.0|You have to love Aphex Twin, his stuff is so crazy.  Its just so different, its just amazing.  <BR>I bought this CD because it had Ventolin on it, but soon learned to love every track on it. <BR>If you enjoy Selected Ambient Works, or any of his other albums, get this one right away.
0140378502|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I have fallen in love with it.  Austen is funny and poignant and though the social commentaries she makes throughout this splendid novel were originally meant for the 18th century, much of what she says still holds true to some degree.  The characters of the story will tug at your heart strings as you laugh out loud.  Absolutley stunning!!
B00005NNMJ|4.0|A small little German guy in a camouflage outfit with such a growling voice it would scare to [stuff] out of Mariah Carey, backed up by a furious guitar driven gang doesn't sound like something attractive. But it is! Accept (a rough, raw and unpolished version of Scorpions) made some great heavy metal albums, and this is perhaps their finest. \\"Balls to wall\\" is a very good album featuring traditional heavy metal, and although Udo Dirkschneider is no David Coverdale it works just fine. Guitar player Wolf Hoffmann is capable to combine the hard and fast with the heavy and melodic, and in my opinion he's far more interesting than many of the so called guitar heroes usually praised (John Sykes for example). Crank it up and enjoy!
B000002BYD|4.0|This album is one of the finest efforts Pearl Jam has ever made especially recently.  This album rocks in a level comparable to Ten and Vs.  At the same time this album represents some progress for Pearl Jam.<br />Present on this album are songs and lyrics that are actually motivating.  Given to Fly has to be one of my favorite songs of all.  I was very impressed to hear this song the first time and thought it was just marvelous. I never knew Vedder had it in him to write such a song.  And, it doesn't stop there.  Wishlist is great, though a bit slow for me.  No Way and In Hiding are also great rock songs.<br />The only thing that holds this album back are some of the odd songs like Pilate, and Push Me, Pull Me.  This has been somewhat of a trademark of Pearl Jam since Vitalogy, but I just don't feel the ones here really work all that well.<br />Besides that, this is probably the only Pearl Jam album of lately that is worth owning.
B000002GYN|5.0|Eagles, with their west coast approach to country rock have never been able to release such a strong album as their debut. Even 'tho their first 3 albums all were great, this is the finest. By this time, Eagles had an edge that later got lost from time to time in the bands sickly-sweet efforts like \\"One of these nights\\" and \\"Tequila sunrise\\". There's no doubt that each and every member was very talented, which is best shown in the outstanding melodic \\"Take it easy\\" and the slower but groovy \\"Witchy woman\\", On \\"Take the devil\\", Eagles showing a heavier side, and \\"Early bird\\", \\"Nightingale\\" and \\"Train leaves here this morning\\" are all examples of how great this band was in the beginning. Compilations like \\"The very best of the Eagles\\" are unable to really capture the band's early excellence, shown primary on this and the two following albums.
B0000028UK|4.0|I see a lot of people think this is Pearl Jam's best, and I just don't agree.  I like both Ten and Vitology better. This album is wonderful and contains many great Pearl Jam songs, but I think Pearl Jam on this album was trying too hard to be another Ten.  It shows in songs like Go and Animal, which are great songs, but just not up to the level that songs like Evenflow and Jeremy were at.<br />But, this is hardly a complaint, and I think the differences between Ten and Vs. are subtle.  Both albums have excellent songs.  In this album, Daughter and Elderly Woman... are excellent tracks and are among Pearl Jams best ever especially for slower songs.  If anything these songs demonstrate Pearl Jam's range in relation to Go or Animal.<br />Overall, this album is only a hair below Ten, perhaps because it is not as new as Ten was for its time, and I would say all of the songs are great.  The only song I am not a big fan of is Glorified G, but I cannot knock Pearl Jam because I understand the message of the song... It just bothers me.
B000002KDO|2.0|Like many other Black Sabbath albums, \\"Master of reality\\" includes great songs (\\"Sweet leaf\\" and \\"Solitude\\") as well as decent ones (\\"After forever), and even awful stuff (like the instrumental unnecessary \\"Embryo\\" and \\"Orchid\\"). At least the not-remastered version is very poorly produced, and the overall dull bass sounds makes you wonder if you're wearing ear-plugs. Black Sabbath were very uneven in general and in particular during the Ozzy years, so for the less dedicated fan some \\"best of\\" album would be all you need.
0064471837|4.0|The book was very interesting. The beginning wasnt understandible and slow, though. some of the words werent very comprehendible, but i guess thats why we have dictionaries. The plot and point was good, with the 9 gates of death. some stuff i still dont understand. anyways, overall its exciting and interesting. cant wait for lirael and abhorsen! .:sam:.
B000002B7Y|3.0|Like others already have pointed out, this is not Ozzy Osbourne's most well known release. But this album is better than its reputation, and on \\"No rest for the wicked\\", there are at least 4 great rockers:<br />Miracle man<BR>Crazy babies<BR>Tattooed dancer<BR>Demon alcohol<br />The rest of the songs display old Ozzy's rather mediocre side. Apart from his amazing debut \\"Blizzard of ozz\\", this release is about as good as any other album from the mad man of rock `n' roll.
B00005JL3A|3.0|I thought this movie would be a little better than it was, but, oh well. Anyway, the worst part of the movie is the acting. Have you not seen acting this bad in your life? Also, the movie needs a little more Colin Salmon. He is about the only non-boring character in the movie. Another bad thing is the fact that the whole movie takes place in a weird underground facility. What happened to the glamourous mansion and dilapidated laboratory? The game doesn't take place in some shiny, futuristic complex. Another problem. I guess the good parts of the movie are action sequences when fighting the undead creatures. The zombies also look good, but sometimes the creatures look like unscary crap!Who likes that? Take a look at the version of the Licker and you'll see what I'm talking about. There are some very well done jump scenes, such as with the man being attacked by his sister. But others are deliberately there, trying to be suspenseful. Then, after you freak slightly, it turns out to be nothing at all! The movie was well-done, but too short, sometimes boring, and untrue to the game. Overall, if you like zombie movies or Resident Evil, you might wanna check this movie out. If you don't like zombies or RE, stay far, far away!
B0000844IT|4.0|Many things written here were written in previous reviews, but I think it helps to reinforce/legitimize what you are reading.  I will assume you have never seen this movie.  Here (in Boomstick Bullet form) are what to look for in this film:<br />-First off; This is a great horror/comedy.  Bruce Campbell is the next best thing to Jim Carey for outrageous facial expressions.<br />-If you were expecting another evil dead, forget it.  Each film is unique in it's own way.<br />-If it weren't for some language and one sex scene, I'd say let older pre-teens watch it.  More funny than scary.<br />-The special FX might seam a little \\"quaint\\" by todays standards (even by 1958 standards).  CG was not a big part of the budget.  Still great fun.<br />-The theatrical release is far superior to the \\"Directors cut\\".  Sometimes the studios ACTUALLY know better.<br />-The theatrical release is far superior in DVD quality also.  Sound is noticably better.<br />-Pakaging is disappointing.  A non-snapable clam-shell with a carboard sleeve(can you find one not bent at the corners?).<br />-The little book by Campbell \\"nut-shelling\\" the production history is actually entertaining.<br />-If you own a prior version...  ...yea, you got [took]! (great for newer collectors, like me).<br />-The extras are limited, though the \\"making of\\" featurette is quite entertaining.<br />-The deleted scenes were deleted in good conscience.  Again, they made the right choices.<br />-Remember, if you don't remember the magic words... PUNT!!!
0553260111|5.0|After a few years of having read the Bourne trilogy, the movie version forced me to go back to the books. Unfortunately, movies cannot provide the same intrigue and suspense that readers like me, are attracted to in books. Mr. Ludlum continues to amaze me with his plots and the way stories develop. I found it very difficult to leave the book for long periods of time.
B000089RVX|4.0|I saw evanescence this summer at a local Little Rock restaurant and knew they were going to make it big since I heard they were working on a new cd. After listening to Fallen I was a bit disappointed. I am hoping they will re-release their first cd, Origin, again because it was definitely better and they didn't sound so much like linkin park.
B00000JZC4|4.0|Every genre of popular music has its own set of unwritten rules, from punk's avoidance of the mainstream to pop's emphasis on looks as much as talent. Perhaps the foremost rule of the industrial genre is that \\"real\\" industrial fans are to dismiss the crop of bands that emerged in the wake of Nine Inch Nails as derivative, and thus to be dismissed as \\"industrial lite.\\" However, Filter's second album, TITLE OF RECORD, once again proves that unwritten rules are generally stupid.<br />With this album, Richard Patrick has loosed most of the chains that tied him to Trent Reznor's work. Rather, any remaining similarities occur simply because both artists are working in the same genre. Make no mistake, this is an industrial album, but instead of using the ragged distortion that made SHORT BUS repetitive, here Patrick is more inclined to create swirling atmospheric effects for what are otherwise straightforward rock songs. Of course, the fact that this album has atmosphere does not change the fact that most of these songs are really freakin' loud, and sound best when played that way (especially \\"Welcome To The Fold,\\" which is definitely the best track here).<br />Derivative? Maybe. But when you're this good, who cares?
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. This movie has it all... the comedy, the love story, the interesting philosophical debate of what Groundhog Day actually means. This movie will live on forever.
B000069AUI|5.0|I loved Parachutes but Rush is even better.  All songs are great except for A Whisper.  The songs may be rated in the following order:<br />1. A Rush of Blood to the Head<br />2. Clocks<br />3. Politik<br />4. The Scientist<br />5. Warning Sign<br />6. Amsterdam<br />7. God Put a Smile Upon Your Face<br />8. Daylight<br />9. In My Place<br />10. Green Eyes<br />11. A Whisper<br />All of these songs are great with the exception of A Whisper.  I loved hearing this CD play in the background of Six Feet Under last week.
B000000W9Z|5.0|Perhaps people tend to dismiss this album because it came later in Bowie's career, or perhaps it's because of the Nine Inch Nails association, (he toured with them in support of this album) but whatever the reason is, it's unfounded because this is a work of pure brilliance.  Yes, the &quot;plot&quot; of this &quot;Gothic Drama Hyper-Cycle&quot; is half-baked, but so were the &quot;plots&quot; of  &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars&quot; and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;.  At first listen this album may come off as heavy handed and pretentious, but once you realize that it is dripping in humour and irony it becomes a fun, chilling, disturbing, and fascinating record that demands and rewards repeated listens.  The music defies categorization, incorprorating elements of rock, industrial, electronic, jazz, and classical.  Mike Garson's piano sends chills up the spine, as does Bowie's throaty, mature, nicotine-stained vibrato.   Combined with Eno's sonic contributions, Alomar's signature guitar work, and bowie's impressionist collage-style lyrics, this album is a true masterpiece.  Be prepared, however--it is demanding.  Easy listening this aint.
B00005JL96|5.0|This is a really cute movie that tries to teach kids that not all families are mom, dad &amp; 2.5 sibs. This movie shows kids that even though your family may not be &quot;normal&quot;, it may still be a loving family &amp; &quot;no one gets left behind&quot;. This would be great for kids of divorce or blended families. Very progressive-esp. for a Disney movie. Esp shows kids that even though Stitch is bad @ times, he is still family &amp; worthwhile.
B00006GFA1|4.0|Dave is one lucky guy. He has played drums on the two best albums of the last five years.<br />   I accidentally picked up the clean version of this album at a local superstore. I always open CDs as I leave the store and throw away all the wrapper stuff in the trash. I didn't realize that I had the clean version until I cracked the cellophane airlock.<br />   The editing on this version of the album is a treat.  All swear words are beeped out with a compressed, grating loud beep. Maybe that is par for the course, but I would hope not. It kind of seems like a joke the way they beeped out the swearing.  Sort of a curse upon thee for buying the album from a superstore.<br />   The clean version is not bad though. There really isn't that much objectionable material. Most of it is contained in \\"Six Shooter\\". I would recommend the explicit version for moral reasons, but you can't really go wrong with this one.<br />   The rockin is hard. Not as heavy as the old Kyuss stuff. But the creepy melodicism of Queens more than makes up for it.  \\"First It Giveth\\", \\"The Sky Is Fallin'\\", and \\"Hangin' Tree\\" are all better than \\"No One Knows\\"; but the format might be too long for radio. This isn't '72 after all. People can't be expected to listen to only one thing for more than 2.75 minutes.<br />   If you are a fan of music and/or think Craig Killborn is a dish then this would be a great album for you.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage's debut was probably THE first rap-metal album to actually work, and be influential. With Tom Morello's guitar, and Zach de la Rocha's politcal lyrics about war, greed, capitalism, and the government, Rage's blend of rock and rap was potent for its time and groundbreaking. de la Rocha's lyrics were definitely their most powerful and compelling on this album, and even his most personal lyrics (&quot;Settle for Nothing&quot;) are as effective as his political stance. Definitely one of the most definitive albums of the 1990s, and a paragon on what rap-metal shuld've sounded like before bands like Limp Bizkit turned it into a terrible parody.
6301966562|5.0|In the early 80's the industry was just learning about how computers can make our lives easier to live with. The movie Electric Dreams pushed the imagination and allowed us to gain a deeper knowledge and love for what we can do. Unfortunately, this film is out of print on vhs and never made it to DVD. I remember the first time I saw this film, it made an impact on me which may have an answer of why I love working with computers as much as I do and own one of my own. I've tried for years to rent the film one last time, all video stores (BlockBuster, Hollywood Video, Movie Gallery) no longer keep it, in the inventory. It's time we make a stand and tell MGM & United Artist we would like to see and feel the magic all over again...
B00002MZ2C|2.0|Rage's fire was evidently dying when they released the Battle of Los Angeles. Instead of the undeniable power one would feel while listening to their first two albums has diminished, and Rage seemed no longer potent as a band than they did in 1993. <br />There are a few good songs here, like \\"Testify,\\" \\"Calm Like a Bomb,\\" and \\"Born of a Broken Man,\\" but many of the songs sound like as if Rage was running out of ideas for riffs and songs, and de la Rocha's lyrics no longer were inspired by any new ideas, and most of them sound like rehashed lyrics from their 2 previous songs. I'd recommend their self titled album and Evil Empire over this one any day of the week.
B000002LGW|4.0|I would say it is an amazing CD. Could be a bit shorter and a bit cheaper though :-). Anyway, worthwhile. When you see a dozen indie-pop-electronic-rock bands running around, it is quite an acomplishment to have music that is better then most of them, even a decade later. Definetly inspired more than a genration of musicians in style and language. Enjoy it.
B000001Y5X|4.0|This was written to sound specifically like elementary school rhymes, so it is different from what M.Manson is doing today on Holy Wood and Golden Age of Grotesque. The band line-up was entirely different, today only Manson remains. The lyrics are crazy, the music itself is almost techno in it's variety and unreliability (not that it sounds bad, it's just like a rollercoaster). Worth listening to at least couple times...
0316776963|4.0|With so many people glorifying the chapter in this book about Sedaris' brother, nicknamed The Rooster, I had to add my own opinion. I hated that chapter. I found his protrayal of his brother annoying, offensive, and totally unlikeable. By saying this, I am not saying I didn't enjoy the book. I did. Sedaris is a very funny writer, though I more enjoy hearing him read his essays on the radio. But please, no more praise for the profanity spewing Rooster, who comes across as nothing more than a ignorant jerk.
B000089RVX|5.0|first off...this cd is really, really good.  when i was growing up, a christian group called 9/11 or something like that had this incredible female singer.  i was wondering if anyone knew if this was the same girl.  (i have steller sound recognition, but it's been 15+years).

0064400557|5.0|As many others have said here, this is an adorable children's classic that has been read by many children for many decades.<br />I have fond memories of reading this book as a classroom assignment in fourth grade.<br />My oldest son is now in first grade, and I am helping him read this book on his own.  We take turns, he reads 3 paragraphs, then it's my turn to read 3 paragraphs.<br />There are many valuable lessons that can be learned from this book.  It is about real-life issues such as life, love, boredom, and death.  It even provides a lesson in vocabulary, as Wilbur is always asking Charlotte what the big words that she uses mean.<br />This is a perfect book for children ages 6-12.  I wish more parents could spend time reading books like this to their children in place of the time that gets spent playing video games and watching TV.<br />This book is a wonderful addition to all the other children's classics that make our world a better place!
0380002930|3.0|In Richard Adam's fantastic book, Watership Down, he shows the true life of rabbits with lots of great detail.  After reading this book, we no longer think of rabbits as cute fluffy bunnies, but aggressive, wild animals, as Woundwort expresses, when he says \\"I told you once, that I would kill you myself.\\"<BR> Watership Down takes place in a field in England where a warren, or where a group of rabbits live. Hazel and his brother Fiver stumble across a sign in the field that says that the rabbits' home is going to be industrialized.   To escape the danger of the land development, Hazel, Fiver, and a few other rabbits flee the field, trying to find a new place to live. Along the way, they meet a variety of friends and enemies, as they struggle to survive. Mixed in with the adventures of Hazel and his friends, are the tales of El-ahrairah, the infamous rabbit trickster. <BR> There are a lot of other interesting details in this  book. The rabbits have their own language, for example, \\"silflay\\" means to feed outside, a \\"hrududu\\" is a car, \\"pfeffa\\" is a cat, and \\"elil\\" is enemies. The rabbit language makes it a little hard to understand the book, but there is a glossary in the back of the book.  Another one of the interesting details in this book is all the animals that the rabbits meet.  For example, the rabbits befriend mice and a gull that saves their lives more than once. The rabbits also encounter many vicious animals, such as a fox, cats, and a badger, all of which try to kill our brave rabbit heroes.<BR> We enjoy this book, although it's hard to figure out what the actual plot is because the rabbits seem to overcome what looks like the main problems quickly and easily, and there never seems to be a long-lasting main problem. This is a good book for animal lovers because there were at least fifteen different types of animals.  Each different animal is captured with superb detail by Richard Adams. We like the book because it was very well written, and we would recommend the book to anyone.

B00006RIO7|5.0|I am not going to write a extensive long review, but I will say what an amazing movie soundtrack this is! First of all I never knew that Catherine Zeta Jones had such an great voice! As a matter of fact, the whole casts are wonderful! I hope they all win on Oscar night! Go see the movie and buy this soundtrack!
B00004RF97|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all-time. Simply every performance is flawless and every character has such a charisma! Of course we are talking about 3 actors who are virtually unparrelled in the art of charisma - Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, and Jimmy Stewart. The first time I saw this film I was blown away by the fast-paced dialogue that is so witty and sarcastic that it rivals anything writers have even attempted today. The thing I liked most about the film was that the romance between Hepburn and Stewart seemed totally real, the look that Stewart gives Hepburn when they're in the library she's telling him about his book is simply genious! Undeniably one of the greatest movies to ever grace the screen!
0880796863|5.0|How can I give this more than 5 ?????<br />Great - my first and best deck.<br />Don't throw away tradition without replacing it with something better. And don't base your deck on it and then say it's obsolete, archaic or things like that. <br />WHEN REVIEWING: review the item based on the item and all it's worth (Objectively) and not the other items outside it (Subjectively).<br />The Rider-Waite-Smith deck is the best for the beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert, master, adept and whatever or whichever term you use. It's your deck.<br />But that's my opinion.
B00006GO99|5.0|There is a review posted earlier than mine which nails this CD's virtues: cheerful jazz, well-performed, nice balance between the piano and the saxophone. Not one of the 12 selections, although four are alternate takes of cuts included in the original 1963 LP, is a clunker. You get a little solo Monk, too, and a good dose of his quirkiness, but the majority of these 73 minutes are just plain fun. This recently repackaged and remastered version has a nice booklet as well, with a few really good photos of Thelonious. Charlie Rouse on sax is a revelation, but don't forget Monk recruited him, created most of the songs, and gave him the freedom to do his own thing within the initial framework of each tune. At this price, the CD is quite a bargain. It is hard to imagine getting tired of this album. More likely, you'll wish you had time to play it twice straight through.

B000084T18|5.0|I'll have to say this has got to be one of the top 10 rap albums I have ever heard. Each of the 19 tracks didn't really blow me away the first couple times, but after listening a couple times, I was hooked. I love this CD! This has been in my cd player since it came out. A great album for anyone who enjoys music by eminem. The whole cd is incredible, and I give huge props to him for this album. Phenomenal cd, a must have for anyone true to rap, and hip-hop. It's sold something around 3-4 million copies in around a month. That's gotta mean something right? my advice, go get it
B00005Y7AW|5.0|Each song that Rufus Wainright carefully crafted for &quot;Poses&quot; is an emotional journey through his mind. I think everyone can relate to at least one of his songs, like &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,&quot; a song about addiction and temptation. His voice and musical arrangement is original and amazing - &quot;Greek Song&quot; is an infectuous, melodic ride. I LOVE &quot;One Man Guy,&quot; which was written by his father. Although Rufus didn't write it, he makes it shine with his masterful voice, and his sister's harmony makes it even better. I heard an NPR interview with both of them about a year ago, and that's what initially got me interested in him. If you're a fan of musicians like Joni Mitchell or Ryan Adams, both amazing songwriters who expose their hearts with poetic, thoughtful insight, you'll love the emotion of Rufus's songs. Whether it be for the lyrics or for the beautiful melodies, buy this album and keep it in your disc player. I'm on a one-woman mission to spread the word about how fantastic he is!
0385495323|5.0|I picked up this book on a whim at the Discovery Channel Store, and was delighted that I did.

As Mr. Spock might say, &quot;Fascinating&quot;.  Thanks Mr. Singh.
B000063DI9|5.0|I was a big metal fan in high school. I started to grow away from it in college, and by now (I'm 26) I hardly listen to the genre at all. But I recently dusted off some of my old Iron Maiden cds for my commute, and it's been a lot of fun revisiting this music, some of which I haven't heard in a long time. Some years have passed; I'm a little bit older and a little bit wiser. I used to think everything this band recorded during the 80s was pure genius; now I can't help but notice the weaker points of their material. Even the much-loved 'Piece of Mind' and 'Powerslave' each have songs I can't listen to anymore.    But 'Seventh Son' is different. For one thing, it's the only Iron Maiden album save 'Number of the Beast' that I can still listen to from start to finish, never cringing, my finger never itching for the skip button. And I think a big reason why it still sounds fresh to me is it just sounds so different from any of their other material. The synthesizers and ultra-processed rhythm guitars forge a sound world that the band never had anywhere else. Sure, they tried to go in this direction with 'Somewhere in Time,' but I think most will agree that something went wrong in post-production there. It sounds muddy and distant; whereas the present album is wonderfully clear and has a very powerful drive.    All the classic Maiden song archetypes are here: the opening speedster 'Moonchild;' the slower-but-heavy ballad 'Infinite Dreams;' the pop single 'Can I Play With Madness;' and the lengthy epic title track. Bruce Dickinson may not be in truly top form here (his voice started to deteriorate only a few years after his joining the group), but he arguably gives his best performances since 'Number.' The wordless belting in the album's eponymous track is one of his career-best moments in my opinion. And the band are all on top of their game here: fiery guitar solos, thundering bass lines, and pounding drum beats abound. It all makes for a terrific record, certainly one ofthe group's very best, and indeed one of metal's very best. This is one that has truly stood the test of time for me, and I'm sure I'll never let it collect too much dust.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is the group America has been waiting for. Two women in love and not afriad to show it. This CD is very good and the best CD I have bought in a long time. t.A.T.u is unlike most pop groups in the US. The US pop groups base there look and lyrics on what they think other poeple think. Lena and Yuila are differnt. They write songs about beeing in love with one another and it doesnt matter what other people think just be in love. This CD stands out from all the others. They have had Nuber one hits all over the world and they are taking over and the US is next.

B00005JL78|4.0|If you're looking for another Blade Runner or A.I., you won't find it here. This film is complicated, but is much more of an action movie than the latter are. Minority Report has many chilling scenes, many great ideas, but it moves like a classic action thriller/mystery. In other words, the focus is on plot and action, not on exploring ideas like great sci-fi does. Overall it is thought-provoking and sytlish, and just shy of being a sci-fi classic.
B00008977N|3.0|The performance was stellar but the DVD version of this show is technically disappointing. The 5.1 DTS Audio is fine but the Visual film quality is bogus. For Peter Gabriel this is simply unheard of. It appears that where ever this show was filmed (Italy in smokey Europe. No non-smoking laws there, people) you can cut the arena smoke with a knife! I got lung cancer before Solsbury Hill went 'boom,boom,boom'!!!<br />  All I can think of is the greedy record company released this show without the imput or permission of Gabriel. Grainy picture looks like 1970's super 8 family movies. Hate to rag, but try to find this one used or as a freebie. Sorry Peter but this one Peter'd out visually.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I noticed this series when it suprisingly won an Emmy for Michael Chiklis for best Actor, TV Drama.  Then it won a Golden this year for best TV series, Drama.  I finally bought the DVD and have been glued to my TV since.  This is the best series on TV, period.  It has taken police drama to another level never, ever seen before.  Every episode grips you and never lets you go.  Michael Chiklis and company are superb in their roles. I have been watching it on FX ever since and just can't wait for the second season to come out on DVD.
0375757295|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel because of Jane Austen's lyrical prose, her timeless subjects of family relationships, love (and/or the search for it), her heartwarmingly drawn characters that I think any reader anywhere and at any time can relate to easily, and her usual witty and critical social commentary.  I find it amazing to think that she wrote this novel nearly 200 years ago! I can think of several people in my own family and among friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who match her descriptions of Anne Elliot, her father and sisters Walter and Elizabeth Elliot and Mary Musgrove, Lady Russell, Captain Wentworth, etc.  Times and mores may have changed in 200 years, but human nature has not changed!  Reading her descriptions of these characters and well imagining Anne's reaction to them, whether it is with resignation, amusement, or exasperation mirror my own thoughts on them.  <BR>Austen has created a wonderful character in Anne Elliot.  I found that I liked her more and more as I read the novel, and, had she been real, would liked to have had her as a sister, friend, or relative.  She is such a wonderful character because readers have a chance to see how she has grown up, has changed, and is willing to go for what she wants now that she is older and wiser (much like anyone else).<BR>The story is not like Austen's other novels (Pride and Prejudice, Emma) because it deals with the issue of a true rarity in life--a second chance at love.  Anne Elliot met and fell in love with Captain Frederick Wentworth, a naval officer, when she was 19 years old. Against her better judgment, she is \\"persuaded\\" by family in the form of family disapproval of her choice.  Her mother is dead, her father and her elder sister Elizabeth (who have a very strange, almost-marriage-like relationship themselves) are social snobs and do not consider a mere captain in the British navy good enough to marry into their family because they are ranked above him socially. Anne's feelings, Frederick's feelings, and the possibility that he could earn a great deal of money by capturing privateers and enemy ships, or be rewarded with a title for distinguishing himself in battle does not occur to them.  Anne is also strongly influenced by Lady Russell, a close family friend and a particularly close friend to Anne. Lady Russell, since the death of Anne's mother, has become a mother-figure/friend to Anne (since Anne is ignored by her father and sister Elizabeth). Lady Russell also disapproved of Anne marrying Captain Wentworth, and Anne, because she was young and easily influenced by those around her at age 19, breaks off her engagement to Captain Wentworth. She has regretted it ever since, and has not met anyone (her father and sister went out in Society, but did not take Anne with them; her younger sister Mary is married, but spends her time complaining about non-existent ailments and about all the wrongs and hurts she has suffered at the hands of family and friends to take any interest in introducing Anne to eligible young men) she would consider as a husband.  Eight years pass, and, by chance, Captain Wentworth (now considerably wealthier though not titled) re-enters her life due to the temporary lull in the Napoleonic Wars.  He too was very hurt by Anne's breaking off of their engagement, but, like Anne, he has not met any other women who compare to her. Both are wary of eachother--and Austen handles both their introspection and their gradual establishment of a stronger, more mature love for eachother with sensitivity and passion. I loved this story because it clearly shows an older (though still young) heroine who is offered the rarest of all things--a second chance at love with the love of her life. She is wise enough to reject the opinions of her family and Lady Russell this time, accepts the love offered, and offers her own love in return!  Captain Wentworth's letter to Anne at the end of the novel is the kind of love letter every woman would cherish. Wow! What a beautiful letter!  It warms your heart, touches your soul,  and nourishes your spirit.  The story is all the more poignant because Anne and Captain Wentworth appreciate eachother and their relationship because they know what they have and what they could have missed had they followed social conventions.<BR>For the die-hard Austen fans, there is plenty of social commentary, and I thought that Austen illustrated the snobbishness of the upper classes very well in her characterizations of Anne's father and sisters. The criteria they use to accept or reject a person are based on such things as whether the man owns property and how much, how many servants he has, title, family background, connections, and, in her father's case, physical appearance is very important.  None of these things have any intrinsic value compared to whether Anne is loved and respected by Captain Wentworth, how he treats people, his ethics, morality, etc.  Austen's subtle humor and way of poking fun at these values contribute to the tone of this novel.  <BR>Give this novel a try.  I do not think that you will be disappointed.  I highly recommend it.
0446677450|2.0|This book was the number one top-selling book in New Zealand for a few years running.  Some of my friends read it &amp; they were convinced that they were in the rat-race &amp; thus, they made some changes which might change their lives for the better (or worse).  That is the main reason why I got myself the book to read &amp; see what kind of impacts it would make on me.  Much of what the book said was common sense anyway or that we were told of the same things by our parents &amp; the parents before them.  That proved to me that not many of us took heed of our parents' advice or that we were severely lacking of common sense.  Just to give you a few examples, in order to create our wealth, we should maximising the income bracket &amp; minimising the cost bracket.  Please?!  Then, it's about us not falling victims to credit cards, &amp; other so-called interest free items.  Anyway, whoever that is strong with their financial managing would find this book lacking of substance that would make a real difference.  The author used his life example to portray to us how easy it is for him &amp; his rich dad to utilise money to make money.  Sometimes, how I wish that the author would go straight to the point rather than beating around the bush.  Anyway, after finishing this book, I continued reading the sequel: rich kid, poor kid, &amp; trust me, you wouldn't miss much.  All I can say is that I really got to give the author the credit for having the ingenuity &amp; the courage for bringing out the obvious &amp; thus, rewarded financially from this.  The best thing in life is that if you are not happy &amp; not content, do something about it.  Doing something is better than not doing anything, or blaming other people's from your own misfortunes or whinging about what if's.  Seize the moment, if you still haven't got my hint.  Try on other more constructive &amp; informative investment books.  I'm sure that there are better ones out there!
B00005JKO9|5.0|Warren Beatty pulls off a difficult task in \\"Reds.\\" He's got to juggle several epic stories, including the rise of the American left in the early 20th century, the Russian Revolution, and a personal story of two romantics in a relationship charged by passion both emotional and political.<br />Any of these story threads presents a difficult task for a filmmaker and Beatty weaves his multilayered tale together with skill. He pays close attention to detail, gives us a multitude of historical characters and events, and mixes his story telling with the words of real people.  Beatty buttresses his scenes with deceptively simple \\"talking heads.\\" These \\"witnesses\\" provide a real background to the John Reed/Louise Bryant story of \\"Reds,\\" giving viewers a good grounding in the passions of the era.  The attention to little details (Reed bringing Bryant lilies, the constant phrase \\"There's a taxi waiting,\\" etc.) provide a rich portrait of two volatile human beings.<br />Beyond the personal, Beatty knows how to handle epic screen drama. The rousing montage that leads up to the overthrow of Russian government is sumptuous and envigorating.  Don't be deceived thought; this is not a \\"pro-Bolshevik\\" film by any great stretch of the imagination.  Reed's dissillusionment with the Soviet system is portrayed in agonizing detail.  Emma Goldman's story, a really great history in and of itself, gives another point of view to the difficulty passionate people have when taking on governing authorities and social mores.<br />The performances are uniformally excellent. Beatty and Keaton are well matched and there's plenty of gems in the supporting roles.

B00006LFGD|5.0|It's a beautiful thing when someone has a skill or a talent which is readily accessible.  Such is the case with Barbra Streisand.  Until hearing this CD I had never really appreciated the skill and talent of Barbra.  Inadvertently this CD compares Barbra with many of the top voices of today and yesterday, and it became apparent to me that Barbra has a very powerful and very beautiful voice.<br />Historically I have listened to very little of Barbra's music; my mistake.  Barbra has an exceptionally powerful and melodic voice.  I've considered Celine Dion to have one of the most powerful voices in music today.  When I listened to the \\"Tell Him\\" duet with Celine Dion, I realized that Barbra's voice is even more powerful than Celine Dion's.  Celine's notes are more pure, but Barbra has harmonics and strength in her voice that could overwhelm Celine's.  However, the song uses the best of each vocalist to create an incomparable vocal experience.  This song will send chills down your spine.<br />Given that I only have 1000 words to describe 19 songs, I am unable to fully describe the experience of each and every one, which I would love to do.  Instead, I'll point to some highlights.<br />\\"Guilty\\" and \\"What Kind of Fool\\" with Barry Gibb are absolutely inspired duets.  Barry's falsetto is a brilliant counterpoint to Barbra's voice.  Eliminate the instruments, they aren't needed.  I could listen to an entire CD of music like this, which were big hits for both artists.<br />Who can forget \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\" with Neil Diamond?  These two singers sound so much like actual lovers that you want to cry.  Enough said.<br />\\"I've Got a Crush on You\\" with Frank Sinatra is a tribute by Frank and Barbra to each other and the place each holds as musical greats.  Such an understated, but gorgeously performed tune, so simple and elegant; this is music from a time gone by.<br />There are several interesting pairings on this CD that make you wonder until you hear them; for example, the duet with Kim Carnes, with her earthy voice.  But when you hear the two sing, it's magic.  Another interesting pairing is the duet with Kris Kristofferson.  Kris never sounded so good (thank you Barbra!).  Considering I've always thought of Don Johnson as an actor, the duet with him could have sounded like an expensive stereo next to a pocket radio.  However, Don pretty much holds his own in this song.  In each of these duets I think that Barbra makes the song, but the contrast with the other singer works in each case.<br />There are a couple of songs that do not work very well on this CD.  At this risk of offending someone, the one I think that works the least is the duet with Barry Manilow.  While Barry's voice works fine by himself, Barbra overwhelms him in \\"I Won't Be the One to Let Go\\".<br />The other criticism I've heard about this CD is that much of the music hear is duplicated elsewhere in various separate formats, and there is very little that is new music.  Thus Barbra's superfans end up with multiple copies of the same music.  Given that I have almost no Barbra Streisand music (shame on me); this CD is outstanding to me.  For those of you who would buy anything by Barbra, please forgive her for the sake of neophytes like me that are just discovering how incredibly well she sings.<br />A song by Barbra generally focuses on the vocals.  Her voice and the voice of her partner in each of these songs are at the forefront.  The music is in a supporting role.  This kind of music is meant to be a vocal experience, and not an instrument experience.  Frequently you will find the instruments could have readily been eliminated; the voices are musical instruments themselves.  The music is generally mellow pop, with an occasional deviation toward a slightly heavier direction (such as the vocal with Kim Carnes), and just as often a deviation toward Broadway or classic tunes.  However, if you like Barbra's voice, you'll enjoy each and every selection on this 5 starCD.  If you like music by artists such as Celine Dion, Charlotte Church, Diana Krall, and Norah Jones because you like the vocals, likely you will find this CD will match your tastes.r CD.

0739302043|3.0|How many times is this tiresome tale going to be told? The Jesus and Mary Magdalene story has been fiction fodder since Holy Grail Holy Blood back in the 80s back then it was hot stuff and considered controversial today the whole idea just rates a roll of the eyes.<br />Now, to the main point. Is the book good? Yeah, Dan Brown is a pretty good writer but the story--the only reason a fiction book exists, right?---is so lame that I couldn't enjoy it. The three stars is simply due to Brown's talent.
0812548094|5.0|Don't worry this review contains NO SPOILERS!  I found Wizard's First Rule to be extremely inventive - and I would implore anyone reading this review that has not already read Wizard's First Rule to be sure to read it first because it is awesome.  Stone of Tears was equally inventive and I think even more interesting than Wizard's First Rule.  I personally found the first 300 pages of Stone of Tears to be 'a little bit slow' - o.k. a little boring.  However, the storyline progress in a much more enjoyable way from about page 300 on and the pacing increases dramatically.  Without a doubt, you will admire &amp; empathize with the good guys &amp; girls.  Conversely, you will loath &amp; condemn the bad guys &amp; girls.  I would argue that Terry Goodkind's biggest strength is his ability to trigger an emotional response from his readers.  I know that Terry plays with my emotions with the skill of a master conductor.  My favorite parts of this novel are those sections that reveal the awesome potential that Richard has as a wizard.  I found myself wishing I were Richard more than once!  That's what fantasy is all about!
B00006RCNW|5.0|\\"The Shield\\" provides an absolutely unflinching look at the crime-busting techniques of a special squad of police officers who blur the line between the criminals and those who pursue them. <br />Michael Chiklis, as Vic Mackey, creates a portrait of a dirty cop who is both disgusting and sympathetic, which is no small feat. He and the others responsible for this landmark series are most deserving of the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards that they have won.<br />Be warned, however. This series makes \\"NYPD Blue\\" look like Saturday Morning children's fare. It is neither for the squeamish nor the prudish. But if you like your crime drama straight and tough, this is for you. The top-notch quality is uniform throughout.<br />Get this set. It is worthy of repeated viewings and, as a bonus, is affordably priced. Enjoy.
B00003CXTG|1.0|or should i say another cheesy love story. pearl harbor, what a bummer. i didn't even know this movie was debuting until i was watching the 2001 academy awards on ABC and then saw the commercial for it. to he honest, i was shocked and looking forward to seeing this film when it came to theaters that may. it's sad to say that while watching this movie, it felt as if i was procrastinating in my seventh grade history class. how much effort did this writing staff put into this movie's plot? what the hell was up with the sexy nurse thing? during WWII, the nurses they used were different as night and day from those chicks that were used in this movie. i don't even think younger nurses were used to treat wounded soldiers during WWII. they didn't wear exclusive hearstyles, makeup, cosmetics, and neither uniforms such as fitted tops along with short skirts and pantyhose etc. but, i don't see a problem with that because since this was a hollywood film, it would have been proper to glamour these nurses up a bit =) when you think things couldn't get any more corny, ben affleck shows up, after we all thought he was killed in that bomber jet. i'm not even going to fuss about the ending of this film, it's not even worth talking about. talk about so much money put into making a historical film and we get some flick about two service men fighting over a sexy nurse.
B000089RV6|5.0|Greatest rock album from the greatest band in the world...there's only one way to listen to AC/DC, full blast.
0060989157|5.0|Whether you are a Crue fan or not, the antics of the Motley Crue boys described in this book will amaze you!  I myself have been a HUGE Crue fan my whole life and I found this book utterly fascinating.  To hear the stories of the fights, girls, and drugs from the mouths of the band themselves was great.  The book goes in chronilogical order, with each chapter being written by a different band member or manager; sometimes repeating stories for different points of view ala \\"Dracula\\".  The 25 year metamorphisis from animals without emotion to civilized, compassionate human beings is truly remarkable.  Unless you are weak in the stomach, I garuntee you will enjoy this read.
B000003B6J|5.0|I downloaded a few songs from the net off this album out of pure curiousity. I have Dr Dre's the Chronic and had one (later) Nwa album a long time ago, but some of it was for humorous purposes only. Well, after hearing this album let's just say, I am hooked. The songs in question are the first four from the album, and I haven't liked a rap album this much since Public Enemy or Ice T. You see, I am very naive when it comes to rap, I know that I am primarily a metal head, but this album may do well to change some of my perspective on the rap genre. First of all, the beats are great, sort of in between the \\"Bomb Squad\\" and Dre's later \\"G funk\\" production. The ryhmes really kick a** as well, despite the protestations of them not being genuine. This album is a timeless rap album, the comparison to \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" is pretty dead on, because like John Lydon, Ice Cube seems to be the most intelligent of these guys. Dre is also great but it is funny hearing him saying he \\"Doesn't smoke weed\\" when he later did the album \\"the Chronic\\". Bottom line: Rap can be just as extreme and full of integrity as any other form of music, this album gets me pumped up!
078322737X|5.0|this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. it is so cool to see nice cars in a movie for a change. not that the new movies cars arent cool but ever one wishes they would have one of these cars from this movie. you better buy this movie because if you don't you will be sorry because it is one of the best movies of all time.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I was a fan of the first Harry Potter film (released in 2001), but thought this one was even better. For those who have'nt read the book, the film offers you a chance to really get to know the characters. The film starts off with the second year of Hogwarts ready to begin. However Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), and Ron (Rupert Grint), have some troubles getting there. Which means a great action sequence! After arriving, they re-team with Hermione (Emma Watson), and the adventures begin. <br />Because the characters are a year older, the story is more intence, mysterious, and exciting then in the original. Making this a wonderful sequel. All of the main characters are back, along with some new ones! And this is a great chance to see the late Richard Harris, as Dumbledore, in his final role. I don't want to give away the end of this film, (even though most of you probably know what happens) but the finale is not to be missed! This is one of the few movies based on a book that actually follows the book! It is a little long, coming in at over 2 hours and 40 minutes. For all Harry Potter fans,this is a must have!
B00005NVDI|5.0|Volume 35 of the Star Trek DVD series features two good episodes from the third season with guest appearances from stars of the recently cancelled Batman TV series.<br />Lee Meriwether plays Losira in THAT WHICH SURVIVES, the last of a long extinct alien race on a deserted planet.  When the Enterprise arrives at the planet, crew men are being fatally assaulted by Losira, who keeps appearing and disappearing from the Enterprise to the planet's surface.  To make matters worse The Enterprise runs into technical problems leaving Scotty to try and sort them out.  In the end it turns out that Losira is nothing more than the planet's defence system which is still runnning long after she and her entire race died out.  This ending is somewhat strange and leaves the viewer scratching their head.  None the less THAT WHICH SURVIVES is still a good episode.  The story is pretty good despite the confusing ending and ee Meriwether has always been top notch eye candy.  Strangely Mr.Spock is rude to almost everyone in this episode which makes the viewer wonder......<br />Frank Gorshin plays Bele in LET THAT BE YOUR LAST BATTLEFIELD a Charonian Police Officer tracking down an outlaw named Lokei (played by Lou Antonio).  His search brings him to The Enterprise.  Bele insists that Lokei has committed some terrible crimes nad must pay the price.  However Lokei pleads that his kind on Charon are treated like this by authority regardless of what they have done.  Essentially this episode tackles the racism issue head on.  Bele and Lokei are both Charonians but Bele has black skin on the right side and white on the left while Lokei is the reverse.  The entire conflict seems to be a big joke but thats what the producers wanted to get across.  That racism was ridiculous and pointless.  The problem with this episode is it is way too preachy.  The story is basically Bele and Lokei screaming at eachother about morals throughout.  Thus the message is crammed down viewers throats.  Still this is agreat Star Trek episode despite the lack o developed plot.  Good casting and a stragnely effective episode that deals with this issue that plagued the 60's.<br />Overall this is one of the better third season DVD's.  There are flaws but it's not terrible.  These are two goods episodes with great guest stars.  Highly recommended!
B000077VPU|2.0|I also taped this show years ago and echo the other sentiments that the entire show should be here.  With DVD it is easy to skip what you don't like, and they should have included ALL of it and let the customer decide which parts he wants to watch.  One of the performers on this disc (his name begins with a &quot;Z&quot;? - I don't have the disc with me right now) is someone I have never heard of and I did not care at all for him, I cannot believe they put this on here and left so much else out.<BR>My other major gripe is that the only 5.1 sound is DTS, there is no Dolby Digital.  I have an &quot;older&quot; receiver/processor that has Dolby Digital 5.1 but not DTS.  I was fooled by this disc, the case has a &quot;Dolby Digital&quot; logo on it but that is only for the 2-channel background menu music.  So I am forced to listen to the concert in PCM stereo.  It doesn't sound bad, but I know it would sound a lot better in 5.1.  I refuse to buy the Eagles &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; for this same reason.<br />Overall this is not a bad disc, the picture and sound quality are better than the same songs on my tape, but I only give it 2 stars because it could have been so much better.
B000002KIE|5.0|An essential CD for any true punk fan...
B000089RVX|5.0|When i bought Fallen i expected it to [stink] but it has turned out to be amazing. Amy Lee releases her soul onto you and takes through her dreams. It is nice hearing a female singer thats so good. Its not like the bands like Kittie, or Jack Off Jill or Otep, Evanescence brings their own style in something i've never heard before. Here is a track by track review.<br />Going Under - This song is a great opener and really suprises you when Amy sings beautifully in the chorus. 9.5/10<BR>Bring Me To Life - Well other than that [guy] from 12 stones its a pretty good song, but not nearly the best.7/10<BR>Everybody's Fool - This is not really a good song its one of the 2 i dont like. 5/10<BR>My Immortal - This is a very good song. Havent heard something like this in a long time. 9.5/10<BR>Haunted - This song is tied with other songs as being the best song on the cd. But i'll let you decide.10/10<BR>Tourniquet - Even though its a cover its another favorite of mine. Very Very good cover work. 10/10<BR>Imaginery - This is an excellent song. Not Suprised eh 10/10<BR>Taking Over Me - My Overall Favorite Song on the cd.10/10<BR>Hello - This is the last song that is tied for the best song. Amy takes you through her mind. She makes you feel like she knows you and you want to know her. Beautiful Bridge.10/10<BR>My Last Breath - Another very good song. 9/10<BR>Whisper - Great Remake of this song. Lovin it. 8/10
B00006RU5B|1.0|I got this album hoping that it would be very similar to my Rage Against the Machine ones. However, this is not how it turned out. The new singer's style is so mainstream I found myself retching. And the lyrics have lost all of their power as well. What happened to the Renegades I once knew? Where is Zach de la Rocha?
0553277472|5.0|Pirsig takes such an amazing approach to this book.  He encompasses everything in our modern world.  How and why everything we have created exists as it does is explained in this book.  The night after I finished it the whole thing came into view and I understood our reality in a new way.  QUALITY has become a word with more meaning than I could have ever imagined, and it has become such a powerful word that I cannot even really believe it, but Pirsig lays it all out for all of us to see.  READ THIS AMZING BOOK!
B000088E6D|5.0|I purchased this CD after catching the last 30-seconds of a story about Michael Buble' on &quot;Extra.&quot; I didn't need to preview the CD, listen to it in the store, read other reviews. The minute I heard his voice I knew that David Foster's latest protegee is destined for great success.<br />How refreshing it is to hear a reworking of these wonderful standards. There are delightful hints of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, but Michael Buble' is unique. His interpretation of George Michael's &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot; is wonderful, and &quot;Moon Dance,&quot; &quot;The Way You Look Tonight,&quot; and &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; are fantastic. He truly soars (pardon the pun) on &quot;Come Fly With Me.&quot; The only misstep is &quot;How Do You Mend...&quot; but even that is forgiveable. I can't wait for Michael's next release. I have been playing this CD nonstop at work and at home and am personally responsible for at least three people deciding to purchase the CD for themselves.<br />Spread the word: Michael Buble' is the next big thing!
B000002U82|5.0|After 30 years of legend DSOTM has become a cliche.  Now wait a minute before striking the \\"Did Not Help\\" button at the bottom of the review and hear me out.<br />It has become a cliche because of what it is associated with, rather than what it is.  To most the mention of this classic work conjurs images of 1970's custom vans, sweet smelling smoke and deep discusiions of how everyone is out to get you(us), or other revelations.  These are, in a lot of cases, very apt, as I can relate from distant personal experience.<br />The heart of the matter is that this is one of the most perfectly conceptualized works of music that you can find.  Influenced by the drug fueled crash of Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett, Roger Waters lyrics focus on the highs(no pun intended), lows and very motivations of our lives and mortalities.  The music hones the classic Floyd space rock to a crystal clear focus.  Not a  single note or sound affect is wasted.<br />When punk arrived in the late 70's, this album became the focus of a lot of scorn.  In retrospect however, it shares the same world view that fueled the punk revolution.<br />As we approach the 30th anniversary of this albums release, we should indeed celebrate what may in the future be called a classical work of 20th century art.
B00005JLS0|3.0|I had such high hopes with this pairing of the king and queen of romantic comedies. How could it miss? But it does. Don't get me wrong -- it's highly watchable and isn't bad, and it's something I'll enjoy renting in the future to watch again. But the sparks, the chemistry that I expected just fizzled. Sandra Bullock's character was too stiff -- and there was no back story to indicate why despite the distracting presence of her character's parents. As for Hugh's character, his family (brother, mother and father) were ever-present, but their was no explanation as to why he was the way he was.  The movie wanted you to develop this sympathy for these two lost lonely -- but funny in a quirky sort of way -- souls, but I found myself looking at my watch 40 minutes into the film.<br />Bottom line: I think the movie just tried too hard to cash in on Sandra Bullock's past successes. Is it coincidental that her character's name is Lucy -- the same name as her character in her best (in my opinion) movie to date, \\"While You Were Sleeping\\"? And the role of \\"best friend\\" is the actress who played her fellow contestant who turned into friend in \\"Miss Congeniality\\" (another cute movie). Sandra Bullock's a good actress...but she needs to stretch her acting chops and get past the romantic comedies as she's quickly outgrowing her abilities in this genre...it's becoming \\"been there, done that\\" with her.<br />The movie's one saving grace? Mr. Hugh Grant. He just gets better and better...and his acting is on par in this movie as he doesn't resort either into the role of cad or down-on-his-luck (yet adorable) loser. And he's not too tough to look at, either!
B00006CYAD|5.0|this is such a great cd, i love every song and know practically all the words. i listen to it all the time over and over again! if you like rock/pop this band is good for you. i was so excited to finally see them on mtv. their a great band and have funny lyrics. their music is fun to listen too and sounds awesome. i completely recommend it! :)
B00005OAIE|4.0|I think John Mayer's album &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. True, he might not have invented that kind of genre of music but he definitely lashes on to it , and he gives it a special touch of his personality.I think he's done a good job expressing himself in this album, and he deserves to be in the spotlight, because you definitely don't find talent like his everyday. I think if you want to listen to good music, you should definitely buy this album.You won't regret it.
B000000OAL|5.0|The first song I remember hearing from this album was &quot;Liar&quot;. I ended up buying it on 8 track way back in '74 and heard lots of other songs on it that sounded great.  This is my favorite Queen album. As their sound evolved, they became extremely popular but I liked their style at the beginning much more.  &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, &quot;Doing All Right&quot;, &quot;Great King Rat&quot;, &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot;, &quot;Modern Times Rock 'N' Roll&quot; are all songs that are energetic.  &quot;Liar&quot; has an incredible ending that leaves you spellbound.  There aren't many albums that went with the time as well as this one and it still sounds good today.  When it came out Queen was a relatively unknown band.  If you like the later Queen I think you will like this but maybe not the other way around.

B000002J20|3.0|I guess I may be one of the rare ones: I find it hard to decide whether or not I love this disc or if I hate it. But for most music fans, it's no contest. This is one of those albums that can draw lines between brethren, and those on both sides of the arguments for and against are equally passionate.<BR>It should be noted that YES had been building quite a base of fans who loved the group's ability to create symphonically textured rock within the context of what was essentially a four-piece rock band (vocalist Jon Anderson rarely played an instrument). But even YES tested the limits of a good thing with this double album. On the original vinyl, ONE track made up ONE side of each disc! Was it a grand artistic statement? Most likely. But was it necessary? The verdict seems to be out to this day.<BR>As I said, some love it and some hate it. Personally, I love The Revealing Science Of God, which is the first composition. It flows well, and stands up quite well along with the band's other lengthier pieces, like Close To the Edge. It has some great melodicisms and other memorable passages musically speaking. <BR>But then the disc wavers. <BR>The second track, The Remembering, has its moments, but for the most part lacks the ability to connect with a listener in the way the first track does. The same holds true for The Ancient, which to me is even less likable than The Remembering. <BR>The final track is Ritual, and this track almost works. The first half, up until the drum solo, is one of the most beautiful and singable YES tracks to date. But once the solo kicks in, the track loses its momentum and disintegrates into directionless, unfocused mush. It tries to regain the beauty of the earlier section after the solo, but it can't. And don't think I have anything against drum solos. But here, it falls flat. <BR>In fact, most of the disc could have worked if some of the fat had been trimmed and the focus sharpened. The band over reach here, and it shows. For every gorgeous inspired moment, there seem to be two more that are a colossal waste of time. <BR>As something to sit around and listen to the way you would listen to Fragile, the disc is lacking. As background music, it works on a strange level. All I can say is listen for yourself. One thing I think both camps can agree on is that this is one weird trip, man ...
B00005JLR2|5.0|I loved it!!!  A very enjoyable and entertaining movie.  I knew as soon as I left the theater that I would be buying the DVD as soon as it came out.  As a 30-something year old mother of two young boys (ages 5 & 3), I wasn't so sure that I would like the movie, but any doubts were soon put to rest.  We viewed the movie on an IMAX screen and the effects were mesmerizing.  My five year old son especially liked the movie, with the pirate theme and the adventure-filled story.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|There are good, solid compositions on this CD.  It's fun; tunes are catchy and danceable.  But it really doesn't deviate much in spirit from the bubblegum pop of the US boys' and girls' bands.  True. taTu is somewhat above that level: the issues of homosexuality raised in the songs are more complex than those that the likes of Britney Spears sing about.  The music is closer to Euro-pop, and sounds fresher.  Finally, the girls are Russian - that's interesting.  But looking at the big picture, we have yet another case of seasoned songwriters and composers writing semi-original music and trite lyrics to be presented by popular and controversial teen idols.  (Incidentally, the Russian lyrics is even more banal and uninspired.)  Lena and Julia play their roles quite well.  But they are not original, independent artists that they are marketed to be.  If you want something fresh, original, and genuine, free from the marketing hype, check out one of many independet singers/songwriters, like Vienna Teng.

He's that good and he's been doing it for as long as anyone.  Nowadays there are songs I don't care for much but each record always has at least one treat, one magical song, that is better than anything else anyone else is doing.  On Silver and Gold, for me, that song is Distant Camera. For you, it might be something else.  All I know is this:  For me, he's the best.  Period.

No one, and I mean no one, could have played this role better than Salma!  She was absolutely brilliant.  The heart, soul and passion she put into this project I believe would have made Frida extremely proud if she were alive today.<br />I promise you, this movie is one to own.
0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe is the author of the novel of Things Fall Apart.  This novel is about a great warrior who goes by the name of Okonkwo and lives in the village of Ufuomia.  The events, which took place in this novel, gasp the reader's attention throughout the story, which consisted of only two hundred and nine pages.  Achebe, without any warning shows the reader how things fall apart in the blink of an eye. The reader must also have prior knowledge about the African cultures to be able to understand the events, which took place throughout the story.<BR>I recommend this book for people who are interested in the history of African.  The story took place in the \\"bush\\", which is the deepest part of Africa, thousands of miles from the city life.<BR>If you have a good imagination, you should really enjoy the story.

B000089RVX|4.0|why do people keep comparing them to linkin park? they only have ONE rap-metal song the whole cd! i think they are very different from linkin park, so if you're buying this for female rap-metal, look elsewhere.<br />that being said, i think this is a great cd. but i wish people would stop proclaiming how amazingly original it is. it's true that this may be one of the first female metal bands in the states that sounds like them, but if you read other reviews, you'll know that they sound a lot like the female-vocal gothic metal scene in many parts of europe. specifically, they really do remind me of lacuna coil, except that lacuna tends to have more male vocals in the background.<br />but this is a good cd. and nice that the states finally have a female-fronted band in the metal scene that would actually be able to be compared to the others in europe.
B000000993|5.0|I highly recommend this CD to any Tool fan, APC fan or just hard rock... Great work from a great band.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Well, I don't pretend to know what these guys are up to, but up to something they most definitely are.  With screaming and caressing guitars, with feedback-laden synthesizers, with strings and drums, with sinuous vocals in Icelandic or maybe no language, Sigur Ros is going to floor you or have you immediately groping for the eject button on the remote.  Me, I'm floored.  Listening to Sigur Ros on this CD and in concert (where they have the two lovely habits of letting their music do all the talking and applauding back to the audience after the encore) was like watching Close Encounters of the Third Kind, reading Gravity's Rainbow, seeing Gerhard Richter's 40 year retrospective at the MOMA, looking at the models for the two final designs of the Ground Zero rebuilding, listening to a Latin High Mass, watching a Barry Bonds swing connect perfectly with a fast ball; it left me refreshed, transformed, challenged, amazed at what man can achieve in art and with a fleeting sense of having somehow glimpsed the three-quarters of the matter in the universe for which we have no name, let alone any understanding.
0671004107|5.0|Contact is an entangling story about Ellie, an astronomer, who stumbles upon what she had been searching for her entire life, a message from other intelligent beings.  The author does a fabulous job predicting the political, scientific, and personal struggles faced with a discovery of this magnitude. <br />Carl Sagan is one of those authors that appeal to a select target group of readers.  Born a scientific mind, writing fiction with scientific undertones was purely nature.  After graduating from the University of Chicago with his Ph. D Sagan went on to participate in councils and organizations that revolved mainly around astronomy.  <br />Although this in-depth story is a type of mental quicksand for all kinds of readers, the scientific undertones are usually only grasped by those who embrace mathematics and think like a physicist. The answers skeptics, like us, constantly search for have been laid out in front of us in a fictional book providing possibilities we can only dream of.  Giving everyone the ability to expand our horizons and think like a theorist, people create their own answers rather than listen to others.

B00007KWHP|5.0|If you own the earlier remastering from a few years ago this may not be for you.  There is a noticeable difference is the sound quality though.  To my ear there is a distinct fullness that 90's remastering doesn't share.  In terms of clean sound, its about the same.  But there is more definition in the new Rhino remastering.  More frequencies I suppose.<br />  (((On a note of doubt:  I'm not sure when bands like Yes where making albums in the 60's and 70's they had any clue that the recordings could be so &quot;exposed&quot; when remastered.  Look at some of the Beach Boys recordings, many of those don't sound nearly as good in stereo as they do in mono (which is different, but..).  I think that is why Phil Spector never changed his stuff to stereo, the music can be robbed of some of it's mystery and magic.))) This isn't a complaint, though, just a thought...<br />  If you don't own this album, haven't heard this album, or are curious about progressive rock; this is one of the most perfect examples of prog rock in all its glory.  Heart of the Sunrise, in my opinion is the best song to come out of that genre; and there are many songs that are in the running.<br />  Even though this is not my favorite Yes album (that would be Relayer); a good place to with is Fragile.
B00004R99R|5.0|Many of you are mad at disney for making fun of greek mythology. Sure the God's are in different colours and not everything is true, but this is a movie for kids! I thought people wanted to get away from the histroy classes and into something fun. Disney didn't want to make a boring film and that was scary for kids. A 4 year old isn't going to point out how in accurate this film was. It is a great comedy. Even if you don't like what disney did, you should have known by looking at the cover. <br />The best character in this film was Hades, the villain. His flaming hair and his cool moves and slang words are great. He is also voiced by James Woods. This is a good movie for your kids. If your thinking of showing this to an older group, don't bother.
0375414053|3.0|Allison Pearson can create snippets of dialog and churn out emails so hilarious that you'll wish she sat in the next cubicle so that you could swap caustic observations about your male co-workers.  She can simulate a heartrending virtual romance and share poignant excerpts from a dead friend's manual entitled \\"Your Family: How it Woks!\\" But by the end of Part I (for no discernible reason-perhaps to give the reader a feeling of progress?-the book is divided into four parts) the relentless recitation of working mom anecdotes and foibles begins to wear on the reader.  <br />The lazy but beloved (by the children) babysitter, the suffering but accommodating husband, the annoying and demanding children, the slimy male co-workers, the spirited friend, the inexplicably wise driver and the other caricatures that populate Kate's existence serve only as foils to Kate's predictable behavior.  We are treated to page after page of Kate feeling guilty about escaping from her kids, canceling lunch dates with her friends, and ignoring her husband.  We can anticipate the outcome of every amusing episode: we know Kate will walk out on a  sick child so as not to miss a flight,  forget a critical bit of home repair, invent lame excuses when she's late to a meeting, then fail to come up with a succinct putdown when a co-worker insults her.  <br />Before very long, I began wondering how she managed to do so little, and do it so badly.  Her inattention to her kids, exaggerated for comic effect, seemed sad and reprehensible rather than amusing.  Though I am quite familiar with the subject matter of the book, I have only met one woman who is as callous about her kids as Kate (and I didn't have a whole lot of respect for her).   And I couldn't understand why Kate bothered to do what she did.  She mentioned owning a few cashmere sweaters, but it wasn't clear that she or her family received many benefits, material or otherwise, from her career. <br />My enjoyment of the book was also sullied bythe author's insistence on harping on that old working-mom-vs-stay-at-home stereotype.  Maybe life is different in London-maybe they don't have stay-at-home dads,  or at-home moms who have meaningful albeit unpaid work, or employed moms who don't sacrifice their kids' wellbeing-but I quickly tired of the descriptions of the mom vs mom wars.   <br />Heading into Part IV, I started wondering how Pearson would pull it all together.  Suddenly, she introduces a few new characters (the old mum, the loser sister) and an intriguing plot twist.  To get revenge on a particularly sleazy male co-worker, Kate assembles a crack team of moms and concocts an elaborate ploy.  The book suddenly holds new promise, but by then we're in the home stretch.  The plot twist fizzles into nothingness, ditto the virtual romance, Kate abruptly quits her job, reunites with her incredibly accommodating husband, and moves back to be near mum.   A disappointing conclusion to a rather thin book. <br />Pearson is a terrific writer, droll, with a great sense of comic timing. I look forward to reading her next book-hoping that she'll eschew the cheap tricks in favor of great characters and a stronger plot.
B00003CXCT|5.0|A long time ago, in 1977, George Lucas and his team of creative artists presented the world with the most successful, most popular and most imaginative work of science fiction ever to grace the screen- Star Wars. Originally a six part saga, Lucas decided to begin with the last installments (episodes 4,5 and 6). EPISODE 4: A NEW HOPE introduced the characters that have been a part of American culture for more than twenty years- the adventurous, pure-hearted Luke Skywalker, the mercenary but loveable Han Solo, the elegant Princess Leia, the wise Zen master Obi Won Kenobi and the evil, black-clad Darth Vader.<br />Although to many intellectuals, Star Wars appears to be trivial fantasy, with flat, underdeveloped characters and razzle-dazzle special effects in a story without any meaning, there is more to Star Wars than meets the eye. Interviews with George Lucas have proven that he suffused the story with symbolism and classic aspects of mythology. In one level, it is a coming-of-age story and in another a saga of good versus evil. Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill), an orphan without knowledge of who his father was, has lost his aunt and uncle in the hands of the overpowering military of the Empire. Obi Won Kenobi, a former pilot, guides him in the Zen way of the Force- a mysterious, spiritual cosmic force. A message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) via the robotic R2D2 and C3PO sends Luke and his friends on a rescue mission to save the kidnapped princess who is in the hands of the evil lord Darth Vader.<br />Their journey takes them to a wild tavern (Mos Eisley) where alien outlaws gather for drinks. Here they meet Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who assists them on their mission by providing his ship the Millenium Falcon. The hairy, ape-dog hybrid Chewbacca is his sidekick. Although Princess Leia is saved and the powerful space station Death Star destroyed, the seemingly happy ending to this first film hides an ill omen- Darth Vader is not defeated.<br />The special effects are striking, particularily on DVD, and the sound, the cinematography and the scenes that were cut due to time (such as Han Solo meeting with the alien mob lord Jabba The Hut) are included. George Lucas's masterpiece is at its finest.
037571412X|5.0|This is a review of _The Dying Animal_ by Philip Roth (in the Vintage Books paperback edition).<br />A friend recommended this novella to me, and I'm very glad she did.  It really isn't going too far to describe it (as one published review did) as a \\"masterpiece.\\"<br />The narrator is \\"David Kepesh,\\" a sexagenarian college professor and minor celebrity intellectual (he has a PBS show) who routinely sleeps with selected female students from his advanced seminar (wisely waiting until after the grades have been turned in -- although nowadays only a \\"David Kepesh\\" or a Philip Roth could get away with even this).  Kepesh describes (to an unidentified interlocutor, who remains silent until the book's final page) the trajectory of his affair with a Cuban-American student, Consuela Castillo.  Along the way, there are interesting (and relevant to the story) digressions on America's sexual revolution of the 60's and 70's, the colonial-era sexual and religious radical Thomas Morton, the surreal nature of the Y2K celebrations, etc.<br />This is one of those lovely books that works on many different levels.  First, it is a funny book.  Those with delicate sensibilities will be offended by some of the humor, but it's hard not to laugh.  This is also (unsurprisingly for a Pulitzer Prize winning novelist) a well written book:  \\"That body is still new to her, she's still trying it out, thinking it through, a bit like a kid walking the streets with a loaded gun and deciding whether he's packing it to protect himself or to begin a life of crime\\" (p. 4).<br />But what most engaged me was how Roth uses the novel to explore some of the thorny issues that surround human sexuality.  Let's face it:  sex is complicated.  Power is part of what complicates it.  And the power is inescapable:  \\"You're going to rule out dominance?  You're going to rule out yielding?  The dominating is the flint, it strikes the spark, it sets it going\\" (p. 20).  We begin the novel thinking that the professor has the position of power in this relationship.  (Campus sexual harassment rules seem to take this for granted.)  But it soon becomes clear that Kepesh is the more infatuated one.  (Or is he?  For in this novel, as in real life, everything is complex and uncertain.)<br />Sex is further complicated by marriage, for which Kepesh has harsh words:  \\"Look, heterosexual men going into marriage are like priests going into the Church:  they take the vow of chastity, only seemingly without knowing it until three, four, five years down the line\\" (p. 67).  Kepesh's response to this discovery in his own case was to divorce his wife.  His son never forgave him for this, and to prove that he is a better man than his father, he has stayed in an unhappy marraige rather than walk out.<br />The general philosophical perspective of the book is (in a very broad sense) Nietzschean.  The narrator is an advocate of freeing oneself from convention and sentimental attachment.  His son is a prime example of someone whose \\"morality\\" is simply a self-mortifying effort at feeling morally superior to others.  However, part of Roth's genius as a novelist is that he does not succumb to the temptation to force his characters to toe an ideological line.  In this novel (again, as in life), reality is always at least a little bit in friction with our philosophy.  So, Kepesh finds himself wondering aloud, \\"I don't even know after a while what I'm desperate for.  ...  Her soul?  Her youth?  Her simple mind?  Maybe it's worse than that -- maybe now that I'm nearing death, I also long secretly not to be free\\" (p. 106).<br />This is a Platonic view of love.  (Like Kepesh, I apologize for my academic tone, but \\"I'm a teacher -- didacticism is my destiny\\" [p. 112].)  For Plato, love is painful, love destroys who we were -- but it is also the only thing that can make us whole, and can make us greater than we once were.<br />So, on the last page of the story (don't worry -- I won't reveal details), Kepesh is facedwith an existential choice:  is freedom more important than anything, and worth abandoning or destroying anything that interferes with it (as Nietzsche thought)?  Or is the pain of love a guide to where we must go, to become complete (as Plato said)?<br />This is \\"the eternal problem of attachment\\" (p. 105), and the central theme of this wonderful book.d with an existential choice:  is freedom more important than anything, and worth abandoning or destroying anything that interferes with it (as Nietzsche thought)?

B00005JKNF|1.0|I saw this film in a movie theatre complex. After about 30 minutes of the incessant, meaningless chit-chat that comprises the whole of this film, people in the theatre began to openly complain -- out loud. \\"This is boring\\"...\\"They should have called this film  'Who cares?'\\"... Nobody argued with them. I sat fighting off sleep, which kept creeping into my brain during this cinematic sedative. My wife repeated \\"God, what a bore!\\" many times.<br />Several people got up and left -- heading for the next room where they were showing \\"Blackhawk Down\\". One man who was stuck there with his wife, who wanted to stay, went out and got a newspaper from somewhere and returned and spent the rest of the movie in the first row, backed turned partially toward the screen, and READ THE NEWSPAPER until the film, mercifully, ended. I swear to you this true.
B000089RVX|5.0|In almost all rock bands today the singer is male. When i first heard \\"bring me back to life\\" on the radio, I was taken aback. Amy Lee's voice was absolutely beautiful and I loved how although it was hard rock her voice flowed instead of just shouting out words like most hard rock songs do. I got their CD at once and find \\"My immortal\\" and \\"tournaquet\\" really oustanding too, although I enjoy all of the songs on the CD. You will really love this CD, even if you listen to light music. Amy's singing talents really show and the rest of the band knows how to kick ...
B000002I8H|2.0|These arrangements of Beatles songs are really quite different from the originals.  If you wanted to hear Sarah sing the orginals, you don't want the album -- then again, I'm not sure why you'd want to hear Sarah sing the originals since her voice wouldn't be appropriate.  <br />As for these versions, which are something between r&b, soul, pop, and jazz and are quite creative in their own rights, Sarah does an appropriate job -- however, she has to sing down a notch to do it.  In fact, on a couple of songs, she sounds like any old pop singer.  Nevertheless, her musical sense is right on target, and her lyrical interpretation of otherwise not outstanding lyrics makes you overlook the words you're listening to.  One disappointment; the tracklist shows Hey Jude as song 13, and it is sort of, but its just a shortened instrumental version of the song.  I personally think Sarah could have done one heckuva rendition of this and that it might have been better suited for her than the other songs on the albumn.  Strange she didn't sing it...but oh well.  This is still an enjoyable album when you want a change.  That is if you've been listening to Sarah all the time, but want a change, you can put this on, and hear a different Sarah.
B000069AUI|2.0|This is not the masterpiece it is made out to be. Just like Parachutes,it is helplessly forgetable. DO your self a favor and pick up the flaming lips's new alblum instead.
B000002GH1|5.0|Like many others looking for the track 'dont you forget about me' i stumbled upon 'once apon a time', having heard the track 'alive and kicking' i didn't expect for one second that the whole album would turn out to be such a gem, 'dont you forget about me'was massive on both sides of the atlantic and tracks like 'all the things she said','ghost dancing' and 'oh jungleland' come from the same top drawer. after hearing this album it just might start you of on a simple minds obsession but whatever you do make sure and buy this first.

039472903X|5.0|As many reviewers have mentioned, this book is a classic.  Ogilvy's wisdom is only matched by his wit.  Some takeaways:<br />1) \\"The wrong advertising can actually reduce the sales of a product\\" (pg 9)<br />2) \\"If you are lucky enough to write a good advertisement, repeat it until it stops selling.\\" (pg 19)<br />3) \\"If it does not sell, it is not creative.\\" (pg 24)<br />4) Hire \\"gentlemen with brains.\\" (pg 48)<br />5) Communicate verbally.  Attend the right meetings.  Remember the French saying, \\"He who is absent is always wrong.\\" (pg 56)<br />6) \\"Any fool can write bad advertising, but it takes a genius to keep his hands off a good one.\\" (pg 67)<br />7) People read headlines 5 times as often as they read the body.  People remember ads with news 22% more than ads without news.  (pg 71)<br />8) Ads in four colors cost 50% more, but are 100% more memorable. (pg 79)<br />9) In TV ads, use the name it the first 10 seconds.  Show the package.  <br />10) Learn from P&G:  They are disciplined.  They only enter categories they think will grow.  They have multiple brands that compete against each other.  They invest heavily to launch a brand.  They never change a successful strategy.  60% of the ads show a demonstration.  They communciate the name of the products repeatedly.  The names fo the products are easy and simple.  They don't use celebrities. (pg 155)
B0000584V3|5.0|This band is amazing, the slide from all soundscapes with ease, gentle acoustic parts, which are diverse in themselves, softer rock parts, too pummeling double bass, and the singer switches from an intense growl to beautiful melodies with ease. The songs are long, progressive, and generally very technical with excellent song-writing. The songs go from raging, dark (a good portion of the album), sad, to somewhat happy, with a perfect flow, a must have for any metal fan, espcially of black or darker metal.
B000002LK1|5.0|Depeche Mode built a huge underground cult fan base with their unique dark undertone style of synth-pop with their masterpiece \\"Black Celebration\\" and \\"Music For The Masses\\". \\"Violator\\", their 1990 commercial breakthrough though brought the foursome into the mainstream spotlight for the first time in their career. Spanning three hit singles, and a successful worldwide tour, \\"Violator\\" became their biggest selling album of their entire career and remains that to this very day. This CD IMO was one of the few great albums that got the praise, success, and recognition that it deserved and is now a classic today.<br />For a CD that is so popular on the radio and the buying public, \\"Violator\\" is a surprisingly bleak, dark, and chilling in mood, and even the smash hits like \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" and \\"Policy Of Truth\\" are hardly happy, and sunny in mood like almost all other popular songs on the radio. I still hear these songs on the radio from time to time to this very day. Reasons why? They are classics, and deserve to be heard by younger Mode fans. Still though, despite these three songs being what many casual fans seem to recognize \\"Violator\\", this album as a whole offers more than just those three songs alone. Some of the songs have some hidden interludes buried within them.<br />A couple of the `non-hit' songs are the best on the album. \\"Blue Dress\\" is one of those and so is \\"Clean\\". The latter song is one of the most punching numbers on this CD and one of the best songs that Depeche Mode had ever made at this point in their career. It may be about coming clean from drug problems, maybe I'm wrong on that but the truth was, their lead singer David Gahan would go into a downward spiral with heroin addiction and nearly overdosing before cleaning himself up but that's a whole other story.<br />Who can ever forget the gloomy classic \\"World In My Eyes\\" with it's dark, beautiful, and gloomy melody, and danceable rhythm backed up by great lyrics. DM are showing their world from their eyes. It was this song that introduced me to the Mode and I listened to more of their music and have been a fan ever since but I credit this song for turning me into a fan of them. \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" remains their biggest charting single of their career and definitely deserves so as it's an intelligent, and innovative dance song with disturbing keyboards and unforgettable atmosphere. There are five fabulous remixes of this song available on the Maxi CD-Single with two B-Sides \\"Sibeling\\" and \\"Memphisto\\" both of which are nice songs in the vein on \\"Pimpf\\". Get the CD-Single and listen to the \\"Ecstatic Dub\\" and Hands and Feet Mix: AWESOME! There's also an interlude track on the parent album version called \\"Crucified\\" which is a bizarre instrumental with menacing acoustic guitars and some angry voice effects.<br />The same thing holds true with \\"Policy Of Truth\\". This song is the best song on \\"Violator\\" with it's dark, low-key beats and odd chord structures. The electric wailing guitars towards the ending are hypnotizing and intense. There are four remixes of this track, all of which are great, and there is a B-Side called \\"Kalied\\" which is a funky, techno dance number. The \\"Beat Box\\" remix is excellent merely being an extended version of the original stretched to 7 minutes long and the \\"Trancentral\\" remix too with different drum sound effects and different style, it's great to hear this amazing song from a totally different light.<br />The other highlight of this album single wise, is the unforgettable \\"Personal Jesus\\" with its industrial pounding beats and also of it's use of twangy blues guitars. The original on this album is much better than the one on the 86-98 singles collection because it quiets down into an abstract song with some awesome metal drums where as the one on the collection I mentioned simply ends with strange guitars after only 3 minutes and 40 some odd seconds. Both versions are excellent but the \\"Violator\\" version is much superior.<br />The`non-hit' songs on this album are just as engaging and as great as the hit singles. \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" is an odd and ominous song with somewhat light marching military drums with intense electronic guitar wailings and keyboards. This song kind of is like a pre-cursor to \\"I Feel You\\" with its rock-oriented sound.  \\"Halo\\" is a good dance song but not as much as the others.  \\"Waiting For The Night\\" starts off as a dark but sweet wintery nighttime trancey song and then gradually builds up into a somewhat ominous electronic number with no particular beat but some great melody and odd chord structures. \\"Blue Dress\\" is an intoxicating and somewhat eerie dance number with addictive rhythm, electrifying style, and dark Siberian winter atmosphere. There's also an interlude at the ending before merging with the final track \\"Clean\\". This song may have been about redemption or recovery it was actually an antithesis to the downward spiral with heroin that Gahan would go into before recovering. Musically speaking, \\"Clean\\" is an absolutely intoxicating number with thundering rhythm, and dark grey sky atmosphere that simply pulls you in before it wraps up the album.<br />Some point to \\"Violator\\" as the album where Depeche Mode sold out to the masses. They say so because DM scored 4 top ten singles, sold millions, and had a HUGE successful tour. To the detractors, I say garbage. This album was one of the few albums in the history of music that was intelligent, innovative, dark, and moody, with addictive danceable rhythms, dark melodies, and brilliant songwriting, and got the commercial success that it got. I consider this album as the best example of brilliant and intelligent albums getting the justice and recognition that they deserve and \\"Violator\\" is a crowning achievement in their career even if it's not my absolute favorite album of theirs./>The `non-hit' songs on this album are just as engaging and as great as the hit singles. \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" is an odd and ominous song with somewhat light marching military drums with intense electronic guitar wailings and keyboards.

Buy this CD and find out why.  Lee's vocals are at once powerfully strong and beautifully soft, and she is backed by strong song co-writers, musicians, and production.  Stand-tracks include &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;.<br />Not since Australia's Suze DeMarchi (late of Baby Animals and a too-short solo career) have we heard such a talented female vocalist who seems like she can sing anything.<br />She makes it sound easy.  If you buy it, go ahead and stash your other CDs away for a few weeks.  You won't need 'em.
B00001QEE9|4.0|What can I say about Pinocchio that you don't already know. We already know it is a timeless Disney classic. The animation detail is about the finest you'll find anywhere. Even with the great detail of recent animated features such as Atlantis and Treasure Planet you'll never find the kind of hard work that went into Pinocchio. Today Disney have a legion of animators and computers, yet in 1940 Disney had about 10. The work they did was simply amazing and Pinocchio deserves to remain timeless.<br />In the UK, Disney have just released a Special Edition DVD. The special features include a making of which was made in 2000, a couple of sing along songs, a couple of short cartoons featuring Jiminy Cricket and a Search For Jiminy Cricket game where you have to be Pinocchio's conscience. The highlight here though is the original 1940 trailer which although not being spectacular will definitely make collectors happy. Unfortunately though, this single disc DVD is very disappointing as a Special Edition DVD. It is understandable that there might not be much original behind the scenes footage, but I'm sure we could have more featurettes on how Pinocchio has helped bring about the animation of today. Here's hoping a Platinum Edition is released in the US.<br />Finally, the reason Pinocchio only receives 4 stars from me is that although it is a masterpiece in itself, I don't consider it to be the best of the bunch. Even as a child I found it long winded and dull colored. There is more defined color to the DVD version but the story is still long winded, sorry!<br />A must for true Disney fans though!
B000002U82|5.0|Try it, I don't know who figured this out, but if you play the Wizard of Oz, and during the 3rd lion's growl on the MGM logo, hit play on Dark Side, and everything matches up.  It will blow your mind.
B000002L68|3.0|Prince has one thing in common with many other musicians, i.e. he can't act.  Purple Rain, the movie, was really bad.  On the other hand, Purple Rain, the album, was great.  It did, and still does, rock (in a kind of retro 80's way).<BR>Princes crazy falsetto screeching was his trademark (as was his apparel of taffeta and lace).  Just ask D'Angelo where he gets his harmonies and vocal style?  From none other than Prince.  <BR>As for me, I loved this album when it came out, the heavily reverbed drums and dated synth sounds helped fashion the eighties.  The songs are still good, but the album as a whole has lost its original tang.  Should be great for school reunions though!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I think it's fair to say I've been a long-time Christina fan. When I first listened to her debut in the summer of 2000, I was torn on the album.. there were some songs I couldn't get out of my head and a voice that gave me the desire to divulge myself entirely into this genre. Sadly, I soon discovered that while some artists had stronger music, few in &quot;teen pop&quot; had an actual talent. It made me extremely disappointed that such an amazing vocalist was being wasted on songs like &quot;Obvious.&quot; It was obvious to me, however, that this girl had the potential to become something if she could just break those rigid chains of being a &quot;teen star.&quot;<br />When I saw her in &quot;Lady Marmalade,&quot; I knew she was fully capable of it.<br />What shocked me most about the album was that she didn't really abandon her vocal style, but has mastered her range and found songs more suited to it. <br />From the start of the album, a vareity of clips ridiculing her, various scandals (including spars with Fred Durst and Britney Spears), Christina softly states she's sorry we can't define her, but not to change.<br />I was possibly the only person who wasn't outraged by &quot;Dirrty.&quot; Why should we be? Look at any rap video, turn on any of the various teen shows on MTV and you will see the EXACT things. Christina is ridiculed for being comfortable with herself.. and we tell her that's wrong!<br />The message that's prevalent throughout the album is that no matter what, you should always stay true to yourself. What you think, feel and believe to be right is what you go with. You have to believe in yourself above all else, and that's something I've always felt should be stressed in pop music. We have enough gooey love songs and pointless dance tracks.<br />She easily goes between a song with a dominating rap beat with equally controversial recording star Lil' Kim in &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; dissing a certain male rapper we won't mention here. Then we gothrough a heavy-hitting power anthem [&quot;Fighter&quot;], a Latin-infused love song just suave enough to not make you want to regurgitate. There are r&amp;b contributions like &quot;Underappreciated&quot; and &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours,&quot; as well as the duet with Alicia Keys. There is the star tracks, &quot;The Voice Within,&quot; which could quite possibly be the How-To-Cope-With-Adolescence anthem of the year and &quot;Cruz&quot; which inspired the greatest sense of freedom in me I've felt through music in many months. The heart-wrenching &quot;I'm Okay,&quot; and the easygoing, self-assertive &quot;Singing My Song&quot; finish off the album nicely, leaving you with the desire to go back and hear it all again. [There's a hidden outro as well.]<br />It's an album that balances everything in perfect harmony. Pigeonhole her to pop if you must. It's really unnecessary to Christina fans what you call her- we just know she makes wonderful songs to inspire us and get us through the day one more time.
B00003CY6M|5.0|Serendipity- A Fortunate Accident<br />This movie is magical from the start! Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) meet in Bloomingdales after accidentally reaching for the last set of gloves available in the store. Jonathan agrees to let Sara have the gloves if she will treat him to an ice cream. This leads to them spending a brief time together in which Sara teaches Jonathan the meaning of Serendipity and how she lives life by following signs laid out for her by fate. She determines that it is how we interpret the signs that determines whether we are happy or not. Before long, Jonathan and Sara realize they have to part. As they prepare to say farewell, Jonathan asks for Sara's phone number. Unfortunately as Sara goes to hand the phone number to him, it is blown away by the wind. Sara feels that the wind was a sign telling her not to give Jonathan her number. Jonathan feels that if fate didn't want them to know each other they wouldn't have met in the first place. Sara concludes that if they are meant to be together the signs will lead them back to each other. And so, Sara asks Jonathan to write his number on the back of a five dollar bill so that Sara can give it to a vendor. In turn, she writes her number in the inside of a used book and states she will hand it into a random used book store. If Jonathan manages to find the book and/or she manages to find the five dollar bill they will be able to find each other. Sara gives Jonathan a kiss on the cheek and they part. And so begins another romantic comedy.<br />It is several years later when Jonathan and Sara are both engaged to other people that fate begins to give them little signs pointing them in the direction of each other. Now this movie is like a typical romantic comedy. We have our two leads and we pretty much know they are going to get back together by the end of the movie. However with romantic comedies it's also about the journey to get there, and Serendipity is certainly a fun journey.<br />John Cusack is charming and definitely has you in his corner; Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best friend is extremely funny and has a charm all of his own; Molly Shannon pulls of the role of Sara's best friend with great flair; and Kate Beckinsale is both amazingly sweet and it goes without saying- amazingly beautiful.<br />The directing is very passionate and has some very special moments, possibly as the director Peter Chelsom's work was improving the more time he spent on the movie. You realize this when you hear about the making of the movie via the special features on the DVD. You learn that the very first scene where Jonathan and Sara meet was actually a reshoot shot months later. You get to see the original version of that first scene as a deleted scene and you can definitely notice the difference. The deleted scenes also have a commentary.<br />As for other special features, they include a Theatrical trailer, a Starz Encore \\"On The Set\\" featurette which is pretty in-depth considering the 20 minute length of it, a stills gallery, Storyboard Comparisons and the Director's Production Diary which is very detailed (it wouldn't hurt to have had a narrator narrate it though). Considering the amount of deleted scenes, this DVD could probably qualify as a Special Edition.<br />All in all, an excellent DVD for an excellent movie.>John Cusack is charming and definitely has you in his corner; Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best friend is extremely funny and has a charm all of his own; Molly Shannon pulls of the role of Sara's best friend with great flair; and Kate Beckinsale is both amazingly sweet and it goes without saying- amazingly beautiful.<br />The directing is very passionate and has some very special moments, possibly as the director Peter Chelsom's work was improving the more time he spent on the movie.

0385504209|5.0|Okay, Mr. Brown, keeps upping himself with each successive novel.  This is a book not to be missed.  I dare you to put this book down once you start reading.  It starts with a gruesome death in the Louvre and continues with an unfolding mystery that spans continents, centuries, and will blow away your conceptions about the \\"accepted\\" histories of art and religion.  This book deserves to be a major bestseller!  (And don't forget to read all his other books, too!)--James Rollins
B00005JLH3|5.0|I truly can say that I enjoyed this movie! There was very little sex and violence, which is needed in this day and time.  I plan to watch it over and over because its great to be in a theatre, eating your popcorn, enjoying the show and music.  I give it 5+++ stars!  great job!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I am a 35-year old mother of two young sons and we all LOVE this CD!  We listen to it in the car every day.  I am more a &quot;classic&quot; rock person and this is one of the first &quot;modern&quot; CDs I've bought in awhile, after hearing one of his songs on the radio.  His lyrics are clever, light-hearted (something we certainly need in times like these) and the music is pleasant to listen to.. especially with a 7 and a 9-year old arguing in the backseat.  And it's worth it when they both sing, &quot;I want to be six again!  Oh give me a red cape.. I want to be Superman!&quot;  It makes it all worthwhile and what's wrong with that?  Don't think about it too much.. just enjoy it!
B00005JL96|5.0|Ok let's go back a few years. Disney got back to being the greatest animation studio with \\"The Little Mermaid\\". This was followed by \\"The Rescuers Down Under\\" which although not considered one of the greats was a follow up worthy of being considered one. Then there was \\"Beauty & The Beast\\" which is the only animated feature to be nominated as Best Picture for an Academy Award and now is the only one that will ever have done so. Then we had the crowd pleasing \\"Aladdin\\" and the most successful animated film of all time \\"The Lion King\\". Afterwards we had the colorful \\"Pocahontas\\", followed by the extremely underrated \\"The Hunchback Of Notre Dame\\". Then there was the pretty average \\"Hercules\\", the unique \\"Mulan\\", the one destined to make more money but didn't aka \\"Tarzan\\". Then we started to go downhill with the unspectacular but hilariously funny \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\", plus there was \\"Atlantis\\". Phew! Now many may consider that Disney haven't made one of the better animated features since \\"Pocahontas\\", but for me I think they lost it a little later after \\"Tarzan\\". So now we have \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" and WE ARE BACK!<br />This wonderfully entertaining feature tells the story of an alien monster who in trying to avoid being destroyed, flees to Earth where he befriends a girl called Lilo. I think that pretty much sums it up. In \\"Lilo & Stitch\\", there is comedy, drama, music and most of all fun. Lilo and Stitch are both funny and the supporting characters are also entertaining. There seems to be no effort to make this out to be as big as \\"The Lion King\\". All Disney do is create a nice, sweet and entertaining animated film with no major expectations, and it is all the better for it. Disney is getting back to what it does best.<br />The DVD itself is probably the best collection of special features on an animated film DVD. In the past, some animated film DVDs have become so technical and taken the fun aspect out of what was probably had when the film was made.<br />On this \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" DVD we have teaser trailers in which Stitch wreaks havoc in other Disney animated film. Those included are-<br />Beauty And The Beast- Belle and the Beast are dancing and Stitch ends up breaking the chandelier. It falls and Beast has to save Belle from getting hit.<br />Aladdin- Princess Jasmine is singing \\"A Whole New World\\" with Aladdin on his flying carpet. Stitch turbos in on his small space ship and invites Jasmine for a ride. Jasmine is impressed by Stitch and goes with him on his ship, leaving Aladdin alone on the magic carpet.<br />The Little Mermaid- Ariel is singing the reprise of \\"Part Of Your World\\" and Stitch comes up on a big wave surfing. The wave comes crashing down on Ariel forcing her into the water.<br />The Lion King- The \\"Circle Of Life\\" is playing and instead of young Simba being shown to the other animals over the peak, it is Stitch who scares the other animals away<br />The DVD of \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" also includes deleted scenes, a behind the scenes look at Wynonna performing \\"Burning Love\\" and the A*Teens music video: \\"I Can't Help Falling in Love with You\\" (which actually isn't the whole song- more like a promo)<br />As well as that we have a short called \\"A Stitch in Time\\". This hilarious segment is comprised of selections of Disney film images and certain characters have been replaced by Stitch. It is narrated by David Ogden Stiers, and trust me it is hilarious.<br />The How-to-hula lesson is fascinating as is DisneyPedia: Hawaii, Animating the Hula and On Location with the directors (which is very in-depth). The Build an alien experiment game is also on the DVD and is diverting.<br />The hightlight of the Special Features though is \\"The Young Voices of Hawaii\\" featurette which features the children who sing two of the songs in \\"Lilo & Stitch\\". It is funny and very sweet!<br />The movie \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" with these special features could quite easily have been spread out over two discs, but Disney manage to squeeze it all on two.This is probably the best value Disney DVD you will get, and it's the best I've seen Disney compile altogether to date!<br />Definitely recommended.two. This is probably the best value Disney DVD you will get, and it's the best I've seen Disney compile altogether to date!<br />Definitely recommended.
B000002UEB|5.0|My original introduction to Queensryche was through the radio-friendly &quot;Empire&quot;.  I knew at that time that they were a powerful, tight, talented, intellectual progressive band.  However, with &quot;Empire&quot; I could sense an ability for a &quot;greater story&quot; that could be told.  When I picked up Mindcrime, I had found that &quot;greater story&quot;.  Of course, they had recorded Mindcrime prior to Empire, but there is no sense of the albums being dated in any way.<br />The story behind Operation: Mindcrime is deep, complex and intruiging.  Their use of sound clips intermixed with the music was, as always, masterful.  The music was tight, and very effectively expressed the mood of the moment... you really DO get pumped up with &quot;Revolution Calling&quot;.  &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; easily conveys that sense of indestructable pride at being used in such a noble cause.  &quot;The Needle Lies&quot; pounds out the feeling of frenetic desperation... although I will leave the reason out so as I don't spoil anything.<br />The melodies, as I have grown used to with Queensryche, are very singable and it is easy to find yourself doing entire songs a capella in the shower.  However, there is always that sense that you just HAVE to have the complex arrangements and technical prowess underneath those melodies to REALLY feel this music.  Thankfully, all one needs to do is step out of the shower and turn on the CD again to get that satisfaction!<br />This album, and indeed Queensryche as a whole, is a good introduction to the progressive rock world.  There is enough good, straight-ahead rock in there that it won't scare off the pop/rock crowd like an intial burst of a band like Dream Theater would.  However, a progressive novice will begin to get that sense that there is something BIGGER than a single cookie cutter 4:30 song... a more noble cause and a deeper experience.  THAT, after all, is what progressive rock is all about... and this album is a great starter kit.  (Although it will still satisfy most established prog-heads as well!)t starter kit.  (Although it will still satisfy most established prog-heads as well!)
B00007E8V4|5.0|One bad side of the file-sharing craze is when artists find that people are getting ahold of songs that were never met for the public. Apparently System of a Down felt compelled to release this album to make the profits they deserve from their work, after finding that the fans (and probably some non-fans) were trading all these studio outtakes. So this disc is not really a fitting introduction to the band if you're a beginner, because these songs were clearly not meant to be presented as a distinct album. Make yourself familiar with their two proper albums first, especially the brilliant and much more focused Toxicity.<br />For fans however, this disc does show all of the band's strengths, proving that they're among the most musically accomplished and uncompromising bands working today. You can also see that underneath their militant political stance, they don't take themselves too seriously, which is very refreshing. Here we can also see some extra variety to the band's songwriting that is not apparent on the more focused proper albums, like the conventional rock elements in \\"Bubbles\\" and the funk-influenced riffage in \\"F**k the System.\\" There's even (gasp!) an acoustic love song in \\"Roulette.\\" There are a few problematic moments here, like the badly undeveloped \\"36\\" and the goofy lyrics in \\"Chic N Stu,\\" the world's meanest song about having the munchies. Fortunately these are balanced by dead-serious tracks like \\"Mr. Jack\\" and \\"Ego Brain.\\" In the end, this collection continues to solidify the deadly System of a Down approach and even expands their palette, but you have to understand where they're truly coming from first.
B000068PQ0|4.0|This latest Flaming Lips CD is an absolutely beautiful exercise in life-affirming songwriting, and a fabulous melting pot of synthesisers and acoustic music. Tracks like the simply joyous opener 'Fight Test', the darkly beautiful 'In The Morning Of The Magicians', the mysterious 'Are You A Hypnotist' and the beautiful, simple message for happiness in 'Its Summertime' make this a stunning effort.<br />More experimental and synthesised tracks like 'One More Robot' and 'All We Have Is Now' push on boundaries, while the two singles 'Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Pt 1' and 'Do You Realize??' are both lovely pop singles, the latter being the album's best, a truly life-affirming song with a beautifully simple message and straightforward emotional opinion.<br />On first listen this album might appear slightly overhyped, but after a few more its charms truly unfold and you see how its all justified. Only the angular 'Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Pt 2' is difficult to get into. 4 stars, and thats excellent.
B00005JKHN|4.0|Ok so you've seen the trailer on Disney DVDs advertising that Sleeping Beauty is coming soon as a special edition DVD for the first time ever. Yet you can't find it in the shops and Disney don't have a release date. Well, I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that Sleeping Beauty- Special Edition is now available on DVD. The bad news is that it's available in the UK, and not the US as yet. However, I can tell you all about it.<br />The 2 Disc Collectors Edition features an all new remastered edition of this Disney animated classic, and it is quite frankly the best looking Sleeping Beauty you'll ever see. The animation looks fantastic and the music is more beautiful than ever. As for special features there is the typical behind the scenes animation info and history that you might find on a Gold Collection release except spread out over two discs. So there's definitely room for an an Ultimate Edition.<br />When Sleeping Beauty was first released in 1959 it was a commercial failure, but became more popular when it was released on video. It has since been re-released on video several times, but it has never been more welcome than it is this time round, because it is the best looking and sounding version so far.<br />Here's hoping that when Disney release it in the US, it has a few more special features added, and receives even more of the recognition that it deserves.
B000000H3Z|5.0|It seems as though I am always hearing a different answer to the question: Which is better, Beneath the Remains or Arise?  These are easily Sepultura's top two releases, but determining which is better truly is a demanding task.  I have come to the conclusion that it is Beneath the Remains.  Unfortunately, it is mainly for personal reasons only.  The CD is good for listening to straight through, but Mass Hypnosis has my favorite guitar solo ever, and Stronger than Hate and Slaves of Pain are pretty solid songs as well.  Of course, I'm not saying that Arise has worse songs.  That CD is just as easy to listen to as Beneath the Remains, but when you get right down to it, this one is just faster.  And I mean really, that's an important part of the thrash genre.  My suggestion would be to purchase both and decide for yourself.  It seems to me that people's preference is about 50/50 right down the middle, but everyone at least likes both, so I doubt if you would be disappointed regardless of your opinion.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is such a great film.  This movie is to Hugh Grant what 'Jerry Maguire' is to Tom Cruise (assuming you thought Jerry Maguire was a groundbreaking role for Tom Cruise)  The screenplay stays so true to the book, while still managing to update it to keep it current.  For example, in the book Will introduces Marcus to Nirvana but in the movie, he gives him a Mystikal CD.  I hate it when I read a great book only to see the film version not do it justice, but this film stays true to the book while still being funny and original.  You'll laugh, you'll cry...see it!<br />The DVD has several extras that make it worth the price.  It has director commentary, behinds the scenes special, and an 'English-to-English' dictionary.  You can also see videos from the soundtrack done by Badly Drawn Boy.
B000089RVX|5.0|\\"Amy Lee\\".....I just want to sit in front of this woman and have her sing to me for the rest of my life. I work in a record store where I first heard this album and we play it continuously. Every single time it's on, someone walks up and says \\"Who is this?!?!?\\" and we just run out and grab them a copy. I love seeing the look on people's faces when they hear it for the first time. I cannot honestly remember the last time a singer has moved me this deeply. Years, definately... this is the best album you will ever buy !!!
B000089RVX|5.0|that have a chick for a lead singer (I'm not a No Doubt fan), but I was captivated by this lead singers voice.  She sounds awesome and she can rock!  Mixed in with the great guitar riffs and drums, this band kicks ...!  I totally dig the lead singer too.  She is amazing.  Do yourself a favor and check this CD out.  You'll be blown away, as I was.
B000000H5K|3.0|I used to be a big Nu-Metal fan.  I used to listen to the stuff that was on the radio and the bands that actually played concerts in my area.  At the time, I thought this album was awesome.  However, I have since moved onward and now realize that this CD really isn't as good as I had originally thought.  Having said this, I do like Roots Bloody Roots a whole lot, and I'm still a fan of the tribal songs like Istari, but that's about it.  I now find the rest of the CD to be somewhat repetetive.  Now, having said that I only really like two songs from the whole CD, you might be wondering why I gave it three stars.  Roots was the CD that introduced me to older (and superior) Sepultura.  My suggestion is that if you are a fan of thrash, don't bother with this one.  If you are a Nu-Metal fan like I was, then pick this one up.  Not only will you probably like it, but it is also ideal for introducing you to Sepultura's greater works.

B00006JJ1O|4.0|Many people have expressed disgust over the fact the two female members that comprise T.A.T.U. are not actually lesbians, but rather part of a clever marketing gimmick to sell CDs.  It's even doubtful that they write their own songs.  Yet upon listening to it, you can't help but be sucked in, by the catchy tunes and the two singer's great voices (which again, may not be entirely their own).  In all this possible fakeness, how can I recommend this CD?  Suppose a world famous chef served you a bowl of fettucine alfredo, telling you he made it himself.  You take a bite; it's the best bite of the pasta you've ever had!  You eagerly finish off the bowl, only to have the chef tell you that he lied, and that it was actually just a TV dinner.  That still doesn't change the fact that it was really good.

B00008AY3L|1.0|First of all, let me say the music on Ben's latest won't disappoint.  It's the same genre skipping, inspirational stuff we've come to expect from him.  But I didn't expect Ben Harper to sell out to the lawyers at his record company. His latest CD is embedded with EMI's &quot;copy protection&quot; coding, which prevents the purchaser of this CD from saving the music to your computer's hard drive, ripping it to an iPod, or creating a back up copy for yourself (all perfectly legal activities, by the way).  Yah, sure there's ways to break the code, surf the web long enough and you'll find a way.  But that's not the point.  And if this came from some shallow, money grubbing bubble gum musician I could accept it. But from the guy who used to sing about giving power to the people?  What happened to the real Ben Harper?  What a disappointment.

0634022296|5.0|As a guitar beginner PLUS a Beatles fanatic, I have been searching for a book that will not only improve my playing but will also allow me to learn the songs that are so much an integral part of my life.... this is that book. A little melodramatic I know, but this is the only book that I've found that contains almost all of the Beatles' songs - from Love Me Do to The Long and Winding Road. It's got all the tunes that you'd expect plus it's got the ones you wouldn't: &quot;Christmas Time is Here Again&quot; , &quot;That Means A Lot&quot; are just a couple. Bottom line: if you love the Beatles and you want to learn how to play their songs on guitar - This Is The Book For You.
B00000JPYD|5.0|The original release content is enough to justify the purchase.  Classic rock guitar with powerful supporting staff.  Great project from the first note to the last.  As strong today as the day it was released.  If you haven't heard this whole album quit reading reviews and get your hands on it, (if you have heard it why are you reading these reviews!)  Probably Trower's best single work.  B.L.T. is equally strong song by song, but not as complex, introspective, or solid as a whole.

I thought that Snipes was really cool and believable as a good vampire. He fits the part well. Some of the motorcycle tricks were cool too.
B000059PR5|4.0|For this movie to be scary nearly 20 years later,is amazing to me.This movie makes you think.It don't matter if it came out in 1983,the thought of nuclear war is still scary to anyone.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|I remember watching Men in Black a long time ago and I remember it being pretty good. So naturally, when I heard Men In Black 2 was coming I was ready to go see it.  It turned out to be nothing I expected.  I think the directors aimed this movie toward a younger audience.  Because the jokes were very childish and my niece thought it was hilarious. Anyway, for a children's movie, it was decent, but I'm not watching it again, even though I like Disney movies....
B000069AUI|5.0|if you buy only one disc this year, do yourself a favor and buy this one.<BR>out of the 11 tracks 7 are excellent, and the rest are very good.<BR>only rarely does a new band (so far this is the 2nd disc) show such talent.<br />the lyrics are very touching, and the music is a match for them.<br />sheer pleasure<br />Gal.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Norah Jones has a lovely voice. Really. And you get to hear that voice in the same tonal range and at about the same tempo for song after song after song. &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; is, by far, the most interesting song on the record and, frankly, I don't know why she didn't do more like it or at least vary the overall color of some of the rest of the record.<br />I'll be visiting the local &quot;CD Swap&quot; with this one very soon.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Strange, funny, warped, clever, touching, sophomoric at times, I guess, and some of the pieces worthy of being played on the Dr. Demento show, but I really like the whole concept behind this collection of love songs. And I appreciate the way that the songs are presented in a pan-sexual (omni-sexual?) way, as if they wrote them, polished them, and then decided later who would get to sing them, maybe by drawing names out of a hat or rolling the dice...Full of every kind of metaphor, describing every kind of love-relationship, from flip sarcasm to searing honesty to painful irony, incorporating fabulously-unexpected rhymes (\\"We've got so many tchotchkes, we've practically emptied the Louvre / In most of our palaces, there's hardly room to manuevre...\\"), all in all amazingly enjoyable and accessible.<br />Some of the vocal abilities occasionally verge on unprofessional/unenjoyable, but on the whole this seems to suit the material. Particular favorite tracks: \\"Reno Dakota,\\" \\"Zebra,\\" \\"Papa Was a Rodeo,\\" \\"Luckiest Guy.\\"<br />I'd love to hear these songs performed live sometime---I visualize it as an evening-long cabaret, something like \\"Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris,\\" in a smoky, intimate setting where the audience can order wine and cocktails. If anyone's up for producing such a thing, drop me a line when you're having auditions...But first buy this CD set---you'll probably leave it on your CD player for months and months, as I did. It's that good.
0790729377|5.0|Tennessee Williams's play of sultry passion set in the French Quarter of New Orleans is a masterpiece flawlessly rendered by the magnificent cast in this classic Elia Kazan directed film.  I first laid my eyes on this wonderful work of art over a decade ago, while in my mid-twenties.  The stark human drama that unfolded before me on the screen literally had me enthralled.  I could not find sufficient words to say enough about it then, nor can I even now, I fear.  Yet as it is in my ultra-indulgent nature to do, I shall, amidst all this rambling, try to do this film fair justice -<br />This is the harsh and burning tale of an emotionally fragile woman, Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh) who goes to find shelter under her younger sister Stella Kowalski's (Kim Hunter) roof in New Orleans after losing their inherited southern plantation estate.  Marlon Brando is Stella's rough, sexually volatile husband Stanley. Driving this fervent tale is the war of wills that is waged between Leigh's fading Southern Belle and Brando's blue collar brute.<br />After having recently viewed this movie after so many years away from it, I was much struck by the distinct transformation that my own reaction to this story had undergone over the years - as if living in the world a decade longer had completely altered my perspective.  Watching this in my twenties, I saw a madly impassioned play depicting unheeded fervor and unrequited yearnings - a fierce romance.  It had been impossible to take my eyes off Brando, his presence on the screen and the power of his performance were so palpable.  I even found some of his cruel outbursts, his pointed darts aimed with such cold precision, amusing.  I saw Blanche's off-hand remarks, likening Stanley to animal or bluntly telling her sister that he's \\"common,\\" more as unfair and underhanded attacks rather than what they actually were:  desperately wrought defenses against a heartless, malevolent force.  It's far more heart wrenching to view this movie now - it disturbs me to the quick, and on some deep intangible level.  Perhaps at 25, I was not yet mature enough to fully appreciate or understand the meaning of this brilliantly insightful play.  Indeed, my viewpoint of the movie is no longer so one-dimensional.<br />This film, when viewed as a whole, encompasses a great many ideals - the acting for one, not only by Brando, but by the entire cast - is shear mastery.  Forget her stints as Scarlett O'Hara or Anna Karenina; Vivien Leigh's Blanche DuBois is bar none the performance of her life!  Her haunting portrayal of the deeply disturbed starlet hiding behind her thin veiled illusions and lyrical genteelness is brilliant.  The sexual tension between Blanche and Stanley is riveting to witness - to this day, there's never been an actor anything like Marlon Brando.  With mumbled speech and brutish force, his innate mode of sexual energy is unequaled. He belts out a flawless performance here, and it passes me why it did not earn him an Oscar.  Kim Hunter as the down-to-earth sister and Karl Malden as Blanche's momma's-boy suitor each won well-deserved Oscars for their respective supporting roles.<br />I can now with equanimity say that I see this amazing play for what it is:  a revelation of life's dark truths.  \\"Death...the opposite is Desire,\\" says Blanche as she throws up for the taking the last shreds of her sanity.  She had come that way on a Streetcar Named Desire via another called Cemetery. True that human beings from the birth of desire, en route to the grave, grasp in vain for the beauty and innocence of their youth.  True that the meek of this earth are easy prey to the ruthlessly cruel.  True that illusion and romance are deft sanctuaries from the harshness of reality. Tennessee Williams hauntingly captures these truths in this wonderful, atmospherically alluring play.it disturbs me to the quick, and on some deep intangible level.

B00005JM93|4.0|For the majority of people \\"Irreversible\\" will probably be remembered as the film with the 9min. rape scene involving Monica Bellucci. Still, if you belong to that category, you may actually be missing the point.<br />Ok, it is a shockingly violent film at times. Also it is true that some extreme reactions of the characters may, at first, seem irrelevant. But as the story keeps unwinding in a reverse manner, rightfully reminding us of \\"Memento\\", the pieces fall in the right places and everything seems logical. Cruel but logical. <br />\\"Irreversible\\" tells a story of revenge or as its director, Gaspar Noe, put it in an interview, \\"it depicts how people act when they find themselves in extreme situations\\". And you don't have to wait long, before you can realize that. The real challenge for the viewer lies in the film's opening minutes, in a sequence which, in my opinion, beats even the rape scene itself. The camera is in constant motion - moving up and down, left and right, the light is almost non-existent, while the music, loud and sharp, hurts the ears. You can sense in the atmosphere that something is very wrong. And soon, bang, you'll get your chance to see that you were not mistaken.<br />If that is not hell, then it should be darn close.
0679746048|4.0|I throughly enjoyed reading this book. While it was hard to follow at times because of the nature of it and the &quot;skipping around,&quot; I think it was a wonerful story. Kaysen's tramatized young adulthood can relate well to the plight of young girls today. For teenage women, mothers, educators of girls, and counselors this is a must-read.
0679735909|4.0|While it was difficult for me to get through this book at times because I am not a great analizer of poems or poetry, I have to appreciate this work of art.  The story is simple, but crafted in such a way that can be admired by lovers of books.  A romance plain and simple set in the mid nineteenth century between two poets and the secrets between them.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a reader and likes romances and mysteries!
B00004XOWM|1.0|First off Limp Bizkit is the weakest band ever. They went from horrible to total garbage. Their isnt one song on this cd that requires talent. Fred Durst is the ugliest wanna be rapper I have ever heard in my life. Im not surprised that their ex-guitarist left the group, he was the only one in the band who really knew what metal was. I hope limp bizkit decides to quit after this so-called cd. Dont ever buy this album.
B0000797IO|3.0|Jennifer Aniston does a nice job of portrayer the average worker stuck in a humdrum job and life.An affair with a much younger intense man changes her life forever. The film has strong performances and some entertaining scenes but the ending is a little dark for those looking for a strict comedy. If you like your endings a little twisted and enjoy insight in a day and life of a typical person you should enjoy this movie.

B000067CPX|5.0|The big boys are back, and what a way to come back. Their last album Californication, was an amazing album, it must be hard to come out with that album and then come out with something just as good, can they do it. You bet they can, they are the chili's possibly the best American band ever, well in my eyes they are. <br />This album came as quite a shock to me at first as it seems to be quite nothing like what the chili peppers usually go for. <br />I was expecting some relaxed songs and some raw songs along the line of all around the world, give it away and so on. I was expecting some old school chili peppers. And that's not what I got, but this album still stand out from the crowd. <br />Not only have the chili peppers continued on their success in terms of good albums but they have brought a new vibe to their collection. <br />The whole of this album is quite amazing, the only song that is somewhat slightly like old school chili'd is 'By The Way', but then its still not quite as powerful as the old chili's peppers of the blood sugar sex magik days. <br />This fact doesn't disappoint me at all, its not like I was wanting this album to be hardcore funky peppers, its a surprisingly mellow collection of songs that is quite consistently amazing throughout. <br />Some of the songs at first may seem a little bad and well, boring, but once you have a listen more then once you start to like the album more and more and more. I was drawn to this album the first time I heard it but it did get better each time I heard it, now I am convinced that this could be one of the best albums of the past year maybe. If not the best its certainly one of the most original. <br />My favourite tracks off the album are: <br />Can't Stop, a quite funky, mellow almost quite ska in many ways. Great lyrics. <br />This is the place, a slow number, about incest I think, Kidus mentions 'I don't want to give it to my babies' kid'. It's quite strange but I like it, I'm not into incest but I'm into this song. <br />On mercury, this is another almost ska number, quite upbeat, nice lyrics, quite relaxing. <br />Don't forget me, probably the best song on the album for me, very slow in places, reminds me off 'scar tissue' spliced with 'otherside' but slowed down quite a lot. This is a very relaxing song, and probably my favourite song from the album. <br />There are plenty of other great songs on this album, but those are some of the main highlights. If you are a great fan of mood music, and you like the chili peppers then I suggest you get this. If your expecting old school chili's, with stomping big bass lines and guitar riffs left right and centre then you won?t get them, but there's still some amazingly great music inside this album which you need to discover. <br />I seriously think this is one of the best albums I have heard for a while, possibly my favourite album of this century so far. <br />It really is a great album which is worth every penny of its price tag, it is a vital addition to any chili peppers fans collection and a vital addition to anyone's collection who is in to mood music along the line of Radiohead, REM and so on. <br />They big boys of funk, have relaxed and mellowed with age, like fine wine or whiskey. This is yet again another classic from the boys, well done Anthony, Flea, Chad, and John.
B00005RHGK|3.0|The next time somebody says to you that road trips are fun, slap them in the face. After doing that, tell them to see this movie. I was not expecting much of anything since the movie got a horrible average rating. Don't let that fool you. The movie isn't great art, but it's wonderfully put together and delivers an hour and a half of innocent entertainment. A brother and sister are traveling back home for spring break. The brother's name is Darry(Justin Long), and the sister is Trisha(Gina Phillips). Their road trip seems to be pretty typical. Playing licence plate games and talking. They seem to hit on the subject that their parents' marriage is iin trouble, and that Trish's own relationship is over. Things go horrible when a big, dumpy looking truck begins tailing them on the highway. The truck scares them a little and then moves on. The siblings later see the truck parked at an abandoned church. A strange looking figure is taking objects wrapped up in sheets and dumping them down a pipe. After another cat and mouse scene between the two cars, the two go back to investigate, thinking they were bodies and that someone else may be alive. Once they find out that it was bodies that were being dumped, Darry also discovers that there are hundreds of bodies in this basement that are preserved and sewn up. From this point on, the brother and sister team struggle to contact help and to flee from this psycho. When they have an encounter with a psychic named Jezelle(Patricia Belcher), they learn of what is really going on. This monster is a regurgating monster that needs to eat body parts to stay alive. Whatever he eats, and you know what he eats, becomes a part of him. Every 23 years, he feeds. She also tells them that whenever the title song plays, something terrible is about to happen. It all ends with a climax that takes place in a locked down police station that was exciting and shot nicely. The movie was written and directed by Victor Salva, the man who did \\"Powder\\". Hehas a nice eye and give us some nice shots and fun angles with the camera. He really sets the setting and makes it eerie and intriguing. The film is pretty much straight terror, but there are some comical moments spread out here and there. While it's a film that can't be taken seriously, it appears to be a fillm that was taken seriously from Salva and his cast and crew. They wanted to put together an incredibly fun, thrill ride and they have done just that. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It is what it is and it does it very competently. It delivers in the 'fun' category. The monster itself is very creepy, and very nightmarish. The make-up design of the creature was very good. The acting is all pretty solid. Gina Phillips, not only being beautiful in the classic sense, was a strong heroine. She was tough and ballsy. Justin Long did a decent job as her terrified brother. Veteran actress Eileen Brennan pops up as The Cat Lady, in a set piece that's one of the better ones. Jonathan Breck plays the monster. He does a good job in bringing out the creeps in the role. The film differs from horror films of the last few years. While it was praised as being away from the \\"Scream\\" era, it really isn't. There are some lines in the film that would of been right at home in any of the \\"Scream\\" films. Plus, these are two different types of films, and shouldn't be compared. \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" was a lot better than I thought it would be. If I had listened to bad reviews and the low average rating, I would have missed out on a pretty fun and entertaining film. I was pleasantly surprised. I think any fan of films like this would be too.
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent, previously an underground hotshot and now signed to Eminem and Dr Dre's Shady/Aftermath, has released what is sure to be one of the best hip hop albums of the year. Dre has boasted that this album will follow in the steps of \\"Illmatic,\\" \\"Reasonable Doubt,\\" and \\"The Marshall Mathers LP.\\" With \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" as hyped up as it was, how could it miss. It couldn't. With Dre supplying beats on the year's party anthem \\"In Da Club,\\" the brash \\"Heat,\\" the slinky \\"If I Can't,\\" and a few others, and production AND verses by Em on \\"Patiently Waiting\\" and \\"Don't Push Me,\\" 50 was crafted to shine. The other musical contributers DO NOT disappoint either, and they include Rockwilder, Sha Money XL, and Denaun Porter. 50's lyrical ability is very good as well. At times, however, he's rhymes get a tad repetitive (he rhymes \\"good\\" and \\"hood\\" about twenty times throughout), and that's why I gave him 4 stars. 50, though, usually uses cunning wordplay, and although there is not yet a real comparison to 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Jay-Z, or Eminem himself, there is DEFINITELY room for improvement, which will be exciting to watch in the upcoming years.<BR>In conclusion, 50, coming across as \\"thug/gangsta\\" New York rapper, is a much better MC than everyone from Cam'ron to Beanie Sigel to Jadakiss. I'd say he's better than DMX as well. What draws his comparisons to the likes of say, 2Pac, is the realness crafted in his rhymes. He switches over from hardcore to sensitive thug to party monster with the switch of a track, and you know he's for real no matter what he's talking about. 50 is one of the realest and I can't wait to see him come up in the rap game.<BR>Good job and good luck on a great album, in both lyrics and music. 50 looks like he got the success he needed and deserved and the partnership to work with. 50 Cent \\"is the future\\" of the rap world. Up-and-comers make way.<BR>Favorite tracks: \\"Patiently Waiting,\\" \\"In Da Club,\\" \\"If I Can't,\\" \\"Like My Style,\\" \\"21 Questions,\\" \\"Gotta Make It To Heaven\\"

0060278250|5.0|Garth Nix has delivered with the final (or perhaps not) novel in 'The Old Kingdom' trilogy. Somwhat shocking scenes coupled with an intricate plot that somehow manages to get away with only half answering all those questions that 'Sabriel,' and 'Lirael' left us with. For example, who is the Disreputable Dog? (I must say I had my suspicians, and they were confirmed) What role does Mogget play? Sam, a Wallmaker? These are just some of the niggling and often frustration questions that we all bought the book to answer. And answer it does. The reader is left gaping and shouting 'More!' at the top of their lungs, while making connections that have otherwise remained unconnected. Sorry if I sound mysterious, but to spoil the plot would be denying you a real treat. <br />Although Nix does not delve as deeply into the minds of the characters, (It is almost a reverse from 'Lirael,' when the characters were so introspective that you thought they'd get nothing done!) the rich plot and curious revelations more than make up for that. The \\"last stand\\" is simply magnificent, although I must admit that I expected more. (I'm thinking somehow calling ALL of the Abhorsen's from death and doing a collosal bell-ringing to deal with the army of dead that Hedge may or may not suceed in raising? Maybe that's just my overactive imagination.) Trying not to give too much away, sorry! If you're looking for clues, this is the wrong review. I will say, however, that this book holds up the reputation preceding it, and does a bang-up job. The Charter magic only accenuates the tapestry of detail that Nix presents. Well worth the effort. Beg, borrow or steal to get this book. And if you don't like it, well, at least it took your mind off the next Harry Potter for a few hours!
0553573403|5.0|George RR Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series receives almost universal acclaim from reviewers. I picked up A Game of Thrones after seeing it recommended by several reviewers. Since it is billed as the entry into an epic fantasy series, I half-expected to see a fantastic world populated by magic wielders and magical creations. Instead, I found that magic is virtually non-existent. Gritty, harsh realism is the predominant theme in Martin's medieval universe. In fact, this book reads more like historical documentary than fantasy fiction.<br />Martin's Seven Kingdoms supposedly resembles 15th-century England during the War of the Roses with the Starks and Lannisters representing the York and Lannister families, respectively. Even the map of the Seven Kingdoms bears vague resemblance the map of Great Britain, with a vast unexplored ocean to the west, a barbaric, frozen land to the north, and ancient, exotic realms to the south and east. At the forefront is the conflict between the honorable Starks of Winterfell and the cunning, powerful Lannisters of Casterly Rock for control of the Iron Throne. In the beginning of AGoT, Ned Stark finds himself installed as the right-hand man of the King, his old friend, while Lannister influence is exerted through Cersei, the beautiful but cruel Queen. Interwoven throughout are myriad other characters who weaves their own intrigues and schemes. In the north, barbaric tribes and direwolves threaten to overrun the \\"Hadrian's Wall\\" guarding the Kingdoms from the frozen wastes. Worse yet, there are glimpses of the Others, mysterious undead creatures, and their army of wights raised from the dead. In the east, a Dragon princess lives among horse warriors dreaming to one day retake the throne that had belonged to her father.<br />Martin's universe is distinguished by its realism. The characters behave as real people would, in realistic if not predictable fashions, with entirely believable motives. I found that reading Martin is frequently frustrating, as there is no clear line of demarcation between good and evil so common in other fantasy works. Yes, the Starks are probably good and the Lannisters likely evil, but there are many gray areas. Seeming heroes commit heinous acts, while supposed villains are entirely sympathetic. If you expect to cheer for good and see evil punished, you would be sorely disappointed, not just with AGoT but likely with the entire series. In fact, for most of the 3 books written thus far, the side of good seems to be sorely persecuted. You just have to accept things the way they are, that good and evil go hand in hand.<br />Martin seems to revel in the anti-heroes. I can't recall how many times I've encountered dashing leading men/women and their equally winsome companions in other works. Here, beauty and wholesomeness often hide vile intentions and a cruel character -- think Cersei -- while Tyrion's deformities and ugliness disguise a truly noble spirit.<br />Martin's world is undeniably dark. The Seven Kingdoms is a violent world, where blood is spilled and lives are snuffed with little pretext or remorse. There is no uplifting conclusion, no triumph of good over evil. In fact, the mood at the end is decidedly downcast as a major character meets with a tragic end. However, there are light-hearted moments, such as those involving little Arya. Tyrion also has many funny lines, in a sarcastic sort of way.<br />This brilliant novel definitely breaks new ground, and quite a few stereotypes, in the fantasy genre. If this book is any indication, this promise to be phenomenal series indeed.rustrating, as there is no clear line of demarcation between good and evil so common in other fantasy works.

B00008AY3L|4.0|Ben Harper Takes you on a ride, a ride through your emotions. DOTI is a incredible cd that should be noted by many. From Touch from your lust, to picture of jesus,you are hooked. The only criticism I have is he needs to stay true to his roots. I want to hear more songs that are slow and inpirational. These include ,forever,walk away,sexual healing,roses from my friends, and anotherlonely day. I love all his music but there were not as many quality lyrics on this cd. After you listen to this cd,take a look at his older cd's, and also his acoustic versions.
055357342X|5.0|With this third hit in a row, I think it's appropriate to call the Song of Fire and Ice series a phenomenon.  Just when you think things can't get any better, Martin turns out another gem.  Judging from the previews for the next book, A Feast for Crows, things are bound to get even more exciting.  I can only hope that this series doesn't turn into a certain other series that started out promising then bogged down completely so that by the time the tenth book rolls around, readers are forced to stomp their feet in angry frustration.<br />Every element that makes the first two book great are all here: tightly crafted narratives, convincing and memorable characters, realistic dialogues, exotic locales, and intriguing plots.  Martin continues to make bold strokes which are completely unexpected.  He introduces the point-of-view of Jaime Lannister for the first time.  The Kingslayer turns out to be a far more complex character than his reputation thus far may indicate.  More than ever before, readers will be completely unsure whom to root for.  Martin goes on to eliminate a major character who had appeared certain to survive the series.  This may come as a complete shock to many, even to those who have come to expect the unexpected.  It would be wise not to become too attached to any character.  Nonetheless, I must admit to having grown rather fond of little Arya and her nightly litany of the villains on her &quot;hitlist&quot; (Joffrey, the Tickler, the Hound, Ralf the Sweetling, etc.)<br />In the aftermaths of the Battle of the Blackwater, the field of contenders for the throne is narrowed considerably.  Stannis retreats to Dragonstone to lick his wounds, while the Lannisters form new alliances and are stronger than ever.  Now firmly ensconced on the Iron Throne, Joffrey rules with unbridled cruelty, and only Tyrion dares to stand up to him.  In the north, Robb is beset on all sides and the future looks even bleaker for the Starks.  Bran is gradually gaining awarenessof his shapeshifting ability in his journey to the north in search of the three-eyed crow.  Arya faces many perils on her wanderings, but is getting closer to home. Sansa is more miserable than ever, but is becoming stronger and wiser.  Jon makes a fateful decision that would ultimately gain him great esteem, but leave him with a broken heart.  In the east, Daenerys is building a formidable army; when her dragons become fully grown, she would become invincible indeed.  Samwell Tarly gets his fair share of space, though he's one of the few characters who don't appear to have much impact, yet.<br />The story has grown more complex and the setting has become richer than ever.  Martin has gotten a real mess on his hand, and whatever the outcome of the series, it would be phenomenal.  The only complaint anyone could have against the series is the wait between installments.  But if the first three books are any indication, it is well worth it.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Have you ever met someone who hasn't seen Disney's The Lion King?  Not likely, and now it's soon coming to DVD.  Finally and Thank Goodness!<br />Back in 1994, the greatest film of all time was unleashed in theatres: The Lion King, a story full of so much emotion ranging from jealous hate to growing love, and from a deeply saddening climax to a surprisingly satisfying overall happy ending.  It's a mouthful to say the least. <br />To me, this film represents everything a film should be.  It has the most powerful story backed by some of most amazing music every composed.  The animation is superb is every aspect.  Every character is memorable.  It's voiced by an all-star cast that actually know how to voice act!  Disney must have lucked out on every part of making this movie because the finished product is nothing short of perfection.<br />Now for the story summarizing part.<br />This is a story about a young lion named Simba who, in his innocence, sees the world as his playground, and that when he succeeds his father as King, everything will be his for the taking.  However, as certain events unfold, he is tricked into thinking he killed his father and runs away into exile from overwhelming guilt.  Simba ends up running away into a whole new carefree perspective on life and in the process he gives up his role and enthusiasm to ever be King.  It's only after he matures into adulthood that he is suddenly confronted by past acquaintances, and, with the help of an apparition of his father, is convinced to return to take his place as King.  Indeed, a very intense ending that will leave you in awe.<br />If you are one of the minority of people who have not had the pleasure in seeing this movie, then I very strongly recommend this film to you.  It is something that is not easily forgotten and will likely leave you in tears.  There has been great debate on whether this film is suitable for children.  The answer is that it most certainly is suitable.  Although many of the themes and jokes are aimed for adults, there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of in showing this to your kids.  Note that the film is rated G, rightfully so in my opinion.  Kids will not be scarred for life if they see this film when they're 5.  There is no doubt both kids and adults (and even teens) would simply love this movie.  Take a look at these facts if you haven't heard of them yet.<BR>The Lion King:  Highest grossing animated film in box office history.  <BR>The Lion King:  Collected $340 million in video sales, the highest ever in video sales history.<br />If that doesn't say something about how good this film is, then I don't what could.  It baffles me to think there are people who don't like this film.  I am telling you, there is nothing not to like about this Disney movie.  For those who don't have this movie: Get it.  For those who already own the video, get the DVD because it's going to have tons of great extras.  This should definitely be apart of anyone's video library.
B000084T18|3.0|50 Cent is the newest rap fanominone since the likes of Snoop Dogg (and his label CEO Eminem for that matter). He has been shot nine times, been in jail, and been stabbed enough times to say he's been through alot to get where he is, and right now, he's the hottest thing in America. For the past years, he's been with his crew G-Unit, with which he recorded several now hard to find albums like \\"The Power Of A Dollar\\", \\"No Mercy, No Pain\\", and many others. But, after running into Dr. Dre, he is now one of the biggest superstars in rap. \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" is a sluggish attempt at being percieved as an album like \\"Chronic\\" or \\"Illmatic\\", in reality, it comes nowhere close to either of those groundbreaking albums, and doesn't even come close to such albums as \\"Doggystyle\\" or even \\"Ready To Die\\". 50 Cent is right now being placed in a pop genre for the hit success of his 2002/2003 singles, \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"In Da Club\\", but from hearing the full album, it seems that's not where 50 should be placed. Here's what i thought about 50's \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" album:<br />1. Intro - Just a coin falling onto the ground and someone putting the cd into a cd player.<br />2. What Up Gangsta 3/5 - Not the best way to introduce 50's sound, but pretty much sums up the sound of the album. <br />3. Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem) 5/5 - Of course, an Eminem produced single featuring Eminem will be good. Sounds somewhat like Eminem's own \\"Lose Yourself\\", however, another reviewer (i can't remember his or her name) said in a list of the \\"WORST MOMENTS IN HIP HOP\\" that 50 should stop mumbling so much, props to whoever that was because he/she's right. 50 mumbles the whole chorus, that's not that good.<br />4. Many Men (Wish Death) 3/5 - Doesn't come anywhere near \\"How To Rob\\" but is an alright track.<br />5. In Da Club 5/5 - I can still stand hearing this even though the radio plays it 20 to 30 times a day! Great lyrics from 50 and a wicked beat from Dre. <br />6. High All The Time 4/5 -OK, not so hot as #5, but this one is definitely worth a few listens. <br />7. Heat 3/5 - Another mediocre track from 50, needs alot of work on the latter half of the album.<br />8. If I Can't 3/5 - ANOTHER mediocre track, like i said, needs alot of work on the latter half of the album.<br />9. Blood Hound (feat. Tony Yayo of G Unit) 4/5 - Better than #7 or 8 and has a darker style of rap and beat, the G Unit guy don't make it so bad either.<br />10. Back Down 3/5 - Read #7 or #8.<br />11. P.I.M.P 3.5/5 - Better, but still consider what i said on #7 and #8.<br />12. Like My Style 4/5 - Yeah, finally, an OK track, good thing there was one or i would've never heard the rest of the album.<br />13. Poor Lil' Rich 3/5 - Weak. Read 7 or 8.<br />14. 21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg) 4/5 - The next radio single, features hip hop crooner Nate Dogg. Alright, but the rhymes are getting wacker and wacker, \\"i love you like a fat kid loves cake\\"???<br />15. Don't Push Me (feat. G Unit & Eminem) 4/5 - An Eminem produced and featured track that isn't good? How? I just really ain't feeling the end of this album.<br />16. Gotta Make It To Heaven 2/5 - Pathetic and annoyning, read 7 or 8.<br />BONUS TRACKS<br />17. Wanksta 5/5 - Another awesome radio single that makes the rest of the album look like junk. A half-hidden Ja Rule diss but very addictive and catchy.<br />18. U Not Like Me 3/5 - A rare to find track off his rare to find album \\"No Mercy, No Fear\\". Don't really care for it.<br />19. Life's On The Line 2/5 - 7 or 8.<br />In all, really, really, consider having a friend buy this and you just burn it, it's not a good enough album to get that much props. It's currently topping Billboard's Top 200 Album Charts for a fourth non-consecutive week and has sold well over 2 million copies. I'm sure you can find a friend who has it so you won't have to waste your money on it.
0812550706|5.0|Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, a boy genius, is Earth's last resort to save themselves from the Buggers. The Buggers are an alien lifeform that live light-years away. Through lack of communication, they start a war with the humans. It's destroy or be destroyed and lossing is not an option. The human race needs a leader; they need someone to get inside the bugger heads and defeat them, once and for all. It's full of twists and unexpected turns. It's a very exciting and well written book.I loved the twist. Read it and you'll see what it is. I was very shocked and that hardly ever happens because usually I can predict these types of things but not in this book. There's not much I didn't like about this book but if I had to mention anything, I didn't like the nudity. That's partly why I'd rate this book PG-13. It's not like adult nudity though. These are 6-12 year old children and their in the military so it's less shocking but it's still nudity. Also the language. There are a few fowl words but it just make the book seem more real. In my opinion anyway. This honestly is the best science fiction novel I have ever read. Read it for yourself.
B00005JLSC|5.0|This is the best oscar nominated movie in the last few years.  It is better than last years Moulin Rouge.  After I saw this movie, I wanted to go dancing.  I hope that this movie will win best picture and everything else it was nominated for.
1891252089|4.0|After practicing with the same manual for several years, I decided to branch out.  I really like the format of this book- it is clearly laid out with nice pictures and detailed instructions.  Most of the poses are very advanced, so I have only incorporated a few, but I will continue to use this manual as my yoga practice evolves.
B000084T18|5.0|Well Im really not much of a 50 cents fan but Ill give it to him. His songs and album is type hot. Anyone who says otherwise well there just .... Why complain about how it [was bad] and ppl only bought it because it was produced by dr.dre and eminem when you got sucked into the hype yourself. I did not even know they produced the album until i seen him mtv. Now Like i said the cd isnt that bad. Sum ppl just cant relate to the things he said because many have told me this is a great album. Man listen you wont know until you hear it for yourself.
B00005MP58|5.0|I read this book as a teenager and actually enjoyed it. However, it was not until years later that I saw this movie and fell in love all over again with Jane Austen and romantic British literature. The settings are beautiful, the pace of life is so characteristic of the period, the cast well suits the characters in the book, and the themes are lush. Oh for some free time to indulge myself . . .
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica rebounded from the terrible and untimely death of bassist Cliff Burton in 1986 by releasing their most angry, visceral and musically sophisticated album. And Justice For All is an album that symbolizes the death of the American dream, maimed by war, greed, and childhood trauma. The lyrics are meaningful, like they have been since Lightning, but on Justice, one could argue that Hetfield's lyrics (and vocals) were at their best. They could easily symbolize the tragic loss of Cliff.<br />They did find a new bass player, Jason Newsted, but for some reason his bass is inaudible, and is only credited with co-writing \\"Blackened.\\" Regardless of that, the band still sounds awesome together as a unit. Kirk Hammett delivered his best solos on the title track, \\"One,\\" and \\"To Live Is To Die.\\" James Hetfield, in addition to being a great rhythm player, improved tremendously since the band's earliest incarnation. He had hinted at his signature growl on Ligthning and Puppets, but on Justice, he lets all of his aggression out, like water from a faucet, and doesn't sound as restrained or watered down as he did on previous albums. Could've been a change in the production style, or James finally getting the confidence he needed to let it all out. On Justice, one could consider Hetfield as an effective vocalist. <br />Lars Ulrich, everyone's favorite overrated drummer, also improves, from not even being able to keep a beat to being really fast, and dare I say it, proficient. Just listen to \\"Dyers Eve.\\" <br />Cliff was gone, but obviously not forgotten, since \\"To Live Is To Die,\\" was based off of several pieces he wrote before his demise, and even wrote the lyrics (\\"When a man lies... he murders some part of the world...\\"). It's an emotional tribute to him, and all of the members played it passionately.<br />I'd argue that this is their heaviest album... heavier than Kill Em All. True, KEA inspired the whole thrash-genre, but a lot of the songs were subpar, and had lyrics aboutheavy metal ruling the world, playing fast and loud shows and apocalyptic tales about war and the Four Horsemen. Justice intertwined angry lyrics,lightning fast solos, bellowing vocals, pounding drums, crisp production, and the sadness the band was feeling, and that's why I'd say that Justice is much heavier than Kill Em All. It was also Metallica's last album to really do anything for me, since subsequent albums lacked the initial spark and intriguing songs of their earliest work. Everything from here just seemed to be a carbon copy of their zenith.
B00006G8HX|4.0|III isn't my personal favorite Star Trek, but obviously it is a must have for any Trek Fan.  Finally they come out with the special editions.  Dvd quality and extras are good but not great.  Best there is though and certainly worth the price.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Although a little dissapointed with the first movie, I feel that the second installment of this series was great! Not only following more closly to the book, it also provided a better story line, improved acting, more humor, and improved special effects. I would be more then happy to recomended this movie to others since I myself loved it so much (saw it 5, count them 5 times in the theaters!).
0062502182|5.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" is recommended for age 8-80, as this book is not a very hard read. Although it seems to be a typical hero/quest story, this story is far deeper than that.  It has philosophical topics in it, and I was enlightened after I read this book. Also, some knowledge of the Bible will give this book a more enhancing flavour, as certain terms come from the Bible (or the Jewish culture).  But the lessons/morals are not religious, so everyone will be able to understand.
B00003CXDB|5.0|And I have to say, I love this movie.  Michael Douglas gave an awesome performance as Gordon Gecko who'll do anything for a buck.  It doesn't matter if that anything is illegal, just as long as he thinks he can get away with it.<br />Charlie Sheen portrays a character that many of us can identify with, someone just out of school in their first job and trying to make an impression on the world.  I think we've all been through that.  In Gordon Sheen sees the epitome of success and only when he is allowed to get close does he see that the grass is not always greener on the other side, there are definitely patches of brown as well, but spray painted to look green.<br />Sheen's performance is good, but I don't think great.  He appears a little too meek at times and yet also assertive in trying to get what he wants, such as sending Gordon a b-day card each year and convincing his friend to get him inside information.  It's a bit contradictory, but I guess we're all like that sometimes.<br />Hannah's performance was just OK.  Overall, the story is great and I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in business, investing, stocks, business politics, etc.
B00005JLF5|5.0|The Star Trek series Deep Space Nine and Voyager all had intriguing and thoughtful opening seasons that kept me watching. However, both failed to keep me going for more then two years. The Next Generation, its TV and Films captivated me more. Then Worf came along and I didn't miss one week of Deep Space Nine except for one episode in Season 7 (\\"Images in the Sand\\") for its remaining four years. Sorry Barclay and Troi, a few guest appearances won't get me into Voyager and still hasn't...(though \\"Pathfinder\\" is simply wonderful). However, as I looked back at all the pre-Worf days, thanks to the trusty and completely enthralling Companion, I wonder why I wasn't captivated. Perhaps it was my youth or my ignorance to logic as opposed to redundancy (but good TNG redundancy). However, I managed to grab onto some great season 2 and season 3 episodes, perhaps all of them, and was a complete DS9 fan with the exception of season 1. With the exception of \\"Emissary\\" and \\"If Wishes Were Horses\\", my Season 1 knowledge was very limited. Early on I fell asleep to \\"Progress\\" and had only seen the \\"Forsaken\\". Now, that DVD is gifting us with the greatest series of all time (and in one package...why Farscape, why?!). The first season is the characters at their most raw and human, in my opinion. Before the producers started fitting Nana Visitor in tighter suits and getting Sisko to beat the hell out of anything that lived (pretty much), the first season offers perhaps (with the exception of season 7) are most human, flawed look at the characters. Kira is just plain mean at times where she is later on a warm, beautiful woman...but in season one...watch out people...mad Bajoran!!!!! Bashir was falsely infatuated with Dax, we get to see a lot of Dax and Sisko as \\"old friends\\", O'Brien is mean too and, on top of that, hates Bashir (which would change thankfully into one of my favorite points in the entire show, them being best friends), and odd as it is to say, we get to see a lot of Quarkand Odo love-hate closer then we would think. And lets mention Sisko more...the first image we get is a crying, sad man trapped in his own misery...Picard and no one else every did that! Did I forget anyone...oh yeah, there's Jake who is a much better kid then Wesley Crusher (God I hate him) and then there is Rom (who is played out as dumb but eventually becomes Grand Nagus of his people), Nog (who is portrayed a punk but becomes a Starfleet hero more or less), and Garak (who is completely untrusted (and overacted personally) but becomes a hero in his own right and a trusted friend in the end). We get to see the flaws and with this foundation we get to see these flawed, slightly agitated people become loving, beautiful people. This show may start out fairly humorous but more dark but paves the road for a show like no other that gives us characters and not caricatures...DS9 has the best writing, the best acting, and the best serialization of any series in history. It truly gives us a view of what characters are like in the future and though the props may not be realistic, their interactions are. The first season gives us a first bite of flawed characters that eventually reach out and bite us back, with a taste of our own humanity shown through them.<BR>\\"THIS IS WHERE HEROES ARE MADE\\"...Bashir<BR>--William Johnson
B00000583F|1.0|I know all of the other reviewers just loved this album but there's no way I could recommend this to anyone.  Sleep may have some of Black Sbbath's style in their music, but they're no Sabbath.  Not even close.  Although Matt Pike may be a pretty good guitarist who can definitely play his instrument, he has no other points of reference in his guitar playing besides Black Sabbath which makes the music incredibly unoriginal and dull. Another problem with the album is that it suffers from very poor production. This would be easily forgivable if Sleep were able to write good songs with decent lyrics or at least had a lead singer that had an intersting voice. Sleep, unfortunately has none of these things going for them. Although this band is heavily influenced by Sabbath, they have none of the majesty or power of Tony Iommi's guitar work or Ozzy's distinctive voice. If you want to listen to a really powerful band with a Sabbath influence, I would recommend Down's first album which blows away anything on Sleep's Holy Mountain. Or better yet, just listen to the first five or six Black Sabbath albums and save your money.

There was no coherent structure to be found, and it is never really explained where the baby came from or why it should feel the need to locate various anatomical features.<br />Aside from that, the flaps were fun.

B00005JLKB|5.0|I became a big fan of Smallville without ever having seen the pilot; so much of what I gathered of Clark Kent's beginnings was what I heard/gathered from the characters in the different episodes. I am so glad that I have finally seen it! While, I believe this DVD is edited in a slightly different way from the TV movie (maybe those who saw the TV debut will help me with this), I still feel the same \\"magic\\" I felt the first time I saw the movie Superman, starring Christopher Reeve; I really felt the Kents' joy at finding (or being found by) a tiny, adorable Clark. I also felt Clark's pain and sadness at finding out about the destruction his arrival brought (through the meteor shower)to the town he calls home and the friends he loves; I also understand why Lex is so curious about how Clark was able to save him (Lex) and Lex's difficulties with his father, Lionel. This DVD was very well done and is visually stunning and although many of the deleted scenes featured in the bonus section would have been great left in, I still think that this is well worth having, keeping and viewing over and over!
B00005Y7NK|5.0|Black Sabbath - Headless Cross<br />1989.  Tony Iommi wanted to build up Black Sabbath's credibility, and being the sole, original member, he recruited Cozy Powell on Drums.  Together with Tony Martin on vocals, and session bassist Laurence Cottle, Headless Cross was recorded.  Released in 1989, this is what Sabbath's all a about.  Crunchy riffs, and scary lyrics.  Cozy's drumming is very powerful as well.  While some might find the lryics as a detterent, or a reason to \\"question the relegious views of the band\\" you're better off not even paying attention.  Tony Martin even said in a recent interview, \\"there's nothing in there that is gonna make you spontaneously combust or anything\\" so don't worry about it :)  I think Headless Cross is the best Tony Martin Black Sabbath album, and marginally better than 1987's Eternal Idol.  This was the first Tony Martin album I bought, and it hooked me.<br />1.  Gates of Hell - Instrumental that leads into Headless Cross.  Used as a taped intro for some Tony Martin-era Sabbath concerts.<br />2.  Headless Cross - The title track, and easily the best song on the album. Thundering guitar riff, some of the best work ever by Cozy on drums, and Martin's voice shines.  This is one song you don't want to miss.  100%<br />3.  Devil and Daughter - Released as a single (so was Headless Cross, the song) it's a very good song, fast paced, good riff, good everything, of course.  95%<br />4.  When Death Calls - Best one word description \\"epic.\\"  Features a guest solo by guitarist Brian May (Queen) - a very good song.  Very emotional, full of energy.  100%<br />5.  Kill in the Spirit World - Lighter, fast paced rocker.  One of my favorite tracks on this album.  Another good Iommi riff and solo. 95%<br />6.  Call of the Wild - Originally called \\"Hero\\" but changed because Ozzy's No Rest for the Wicked had a hidden track titled that.  A decent song, similiar to KITSW.  90%<br />7.  Black Moon - A very good rocker.  Riff, vocals, drums, and everything... sound great.  95%<br />8.  Nightwing - A very good closer.  Iommi playing acoustic and electric parts, sounds awesome.  Very emotional.  Strong vocals by Martin. 100%<br />Easily the best Black Sabbath album with Tony Martin.  Black Sabbath left the 80's with a bang.  I highly recommend this album to any opened minded Sabbath fan, definitely a great place to start if you want to listen to Martin.  Great listen, don't miss it.
185984054X|3.0|Christopher Hitchens, one time skewer of cant now apologist for the republican party and GWB flag-waver, penned this vitriloic piece a few years back, when Mother Teresa was stiill alive.He couldn't stand Mother teresa, and he hides his animus not at all. He actually does bring up a couple of good points, here coziness with the Duvalier family, the muderers who destroyed haiti for many years, and her association with S&amp;L swindler supreme Charles Keating{the exchange over Keating giving her a million bucks is enlightening}.His overall picture, of course, lacks anything resembling balance[never Hitchens strong point},the book being 98 pages, reads as if it were written during a particualrly nasty hangover.Which is too bad.the issuedsbrought up are legitimate,but get obscured by his venom and shallowness. However,to get another side of Mother teresa, whom I consider a holy woman and a saint,this book doesn bring up some points that hagiographers would rather be swept away.For that reason alone,it is worth reading.
B000005IS1|5.0|The MC5 is the revolution, and Kick Out the Jams is the new declaration of independence. The founding fathers of punk, rebellion, and the original anti-American dream, The MC5 were burning US flags and encouraging drug abuse long before the Sex Pistols had even assembled their first carefully conceived wardrobe. A band with adrenaline reserves far too big to fit within the 4 wall confines of any studio, Kick Out the Jams captures the MC5 in the only way possible: Live, right in the eye of the hurricane. The explosive 1968 set is a righteous call to arms, breaking down musical barriers and toppling political cliches in its wake. Joined on stage by a fellow radical, J.C. Crawford and Robin Tyner take turns spewing scathing assessments of the current political status quo, allowing the MC5 to formalize and channel their combined rage after each surmounting complaint. There is nothing formal about the MC5 though. Combining the manic experimentalism of Sun Ra, the untamed fury of Jimi Hendrix, and the songwriting sensibilities of Chuck Berry, The Motor City 5 is the American rock saga encapsulated into one single hi energy entity, and when this band takes the stage, they truly are One Entity. The vocals soar above the racket as the guitars careen wildly into space, independent of the drums smashing and clattering below the untamed bass, blurring the lines between notes and rendering the distinction between instruments and individual members virtually impossible. Eventually all the music, all the sloganeering, and all the noise gives way to one single wave of energy, hitting the listener like a speeding truck and refusing to let up until every muscle in his/her body aches with the pain of revolution. Nothing can truly compare to the visceral frenzy of the legendary five because this monumental album isn't just music; it's a statement.   And this earthshaking statement finally boils down to reveal the lost voice of an entire generation, which after the MC5s patented sonic assault, can only possibly be expressed in a single phrase: \\"Kick Out The Jams\\"
B000005JA8|5.0|Don Van Vliet was asked in an interview how he comes up with these strange sounds. \\"I paint them first\\". The guy was also a painter, and later he was (is?) solely a painter. He went as far to state that the music he's done does not represent him any more. But there's so much more to it.<br />Imagine that you wake up one day and you find yourself disgusted with popular music. All music on the radio sounds similar, doesn't it? Catchy tunes, pleasant but narrow-minded chords, the same old melody transforming into thousands of songs every single day. But, come on, there's got to be another way of playing interesting music without sounding like Mozart, who I respect but don't enjoy. Cpt Beefheart found the way. He 's showing it to us. Here. It's Blues and it's Rock, but it's also very innovative. Trout Mask Replica was well ahead of its time, and it's well ahead of our time, too.<br />But, please, let's get one thing straight. The music in this album is not composed of randomly played sounds. It was well thought-out before played. There are many webpages available to discover that these songs sounded exactly like this in live concerts too: every chord and every knock on the drums in its place.<br />My personal favorites in this album are Hair Pie Bake 1 (instrumental- a truly frightening piece of music), Dachau Blues, Moonlight on Vermont, China Pig (a normal Blues song), Veterans Day Poppy (great finale- it's just you and the chords), and of course, all good hardcore bands ever since have tried to copy/paste the overwhelming power of \\"My Human Gets Me Blues\\", but not many succeeded.<br />Sadly, the samples above don't reveal the reasons why this album is so great. But noone can promise you that you're gonna like it when you buy it. It's different. In the early 80s \\"The Shaggs\\" tried to repeat the experiment. They failed badly. \\"God Is My Co-Pilot\\" also took a shot, but they overlooked a simple fact: First you learn the rules, and only then you can break them. The earlySonic Youth, The Jesus Lizard (their guitarist AND their vocalist), Therapy?, and possibly Drive Like Jehu and The Stranglers are, among others, some of the bands that have also been influenced by Cpt Beefheart.<br />This album will always be there to remind us that maybe, just maybe, music is going to be very different in the times ahead.
B0000508U6|5.0|I received this CD last fall from my rocker brother-in-law. If you are looking for a sound that will sustain you, or support your belief in the myth that the cream will rise to the top in the music industry, then listen to this CD. Each and every song on this brilliant production is a keeper. The depth and nuance is astounding. You won't be disappointed. IMHO this edition of Coldplay is superior to their latest release, A Rush of Blood to the Head. Listen, listen, then listen again, then again. Great stuff.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Considering that i have never been a fan of rock in any way imaginable, how they managed to capture a fan like me is beyond comprehension. I listen mostly to drumNbass, house, breakbeat, etc. and i've recently saw their \\"Like A Stone\\" video on tv. I am hooked. I think i've looped the song a thousand times already. Next stop: FYE - buy album!!!
B000089CKH|5.0|Before buying this album I had only heard &quot;Popular,&quot; so I was surprised when I started seeing glowing reviews of Nada Surf's latest album all over the place.  I was even more (pleasantly) surprised when I heard the album--it's one of those rare ones where every single track hits the sweet spot in one way or another.<br />The one complaint I have is that the album lacks obvious originality--on Let Go, Nada Surf sometimes sound like &quot;Bends&quot;-era Radiohead, or Elliott Smith or New Order or Coldplay.  It may not bring much new to the table, but so what?  How dare they operate in existing genres!  It's done so well, so confidently, and the songwriting is so strong that this complaint seems superfluous.  Nada Surf don't hijack their influences, they suggest them with reverence.<br />While the production tends to suggest other bands, there is definitely some good craftmanship here, subtle dissonances and restrained ambience.  Matthew Caws is a strong singer and the band has good chemistry, which the production is careful to preserve (esp. evident on &quot;Neither Heaven Nor Space,&quot; &quot;Happy Kid&quot;).  The ballads move at a perfectly hypnotic pace.<br />The album's biggest strength is its melodies.  Every song has a satisfying, catchy melody, and the ballads are simply beautiful (&quot;Killian's Red,&quot; &quot;Paper Boats&quot; in particular).  Lyrically, Nada Surf are simple but in a subtle and intelligent way, introspective without being mopey.  Some people might be quick to complain about lyrics like &quot;I wanna know what it's like/On the inside of love&quot; but Nada Surf pull it off easily.  On that song (&quot;Inside Of Love&quot;) they display a reverence for pop, in particular the way a great pop song can make potentially hammy lyrics seem deeper than they should.  Most of the lyrics on Let Go aren't that obvious.  They reveal new layers with repeated listening, just the right amount of depth.<br />Overall the album is simply satisfying in a way few pop records are, gently catchy, melancholy but spry, perfect (as others have said) for a rainy day.  If you're too cool for pop, you'll probably hate Let Go.  Everyone else will hear an album full of songs that stand up to the very best of their genre.  Forget about &quot;Popular,&quot; people!  To hold a grudge over that song would be a big mistake--Nada Surf deserve to be regarded as a serious indie band.
B00000K44W|4.0|I almost gave Heavy Horses 5 stars because it is such a fun, enjoyable album.  It is a wonderful complement to the previous record, Songs From the Wood, which sports the same &quot;outdoorsy&quot; sound.  &quot;Acres Wild&quot; is such a fun song with the delightful mandolin.  It is definitely a &quot;fun frolic through the fields&quot; to quote another reviewer.  &quot;Rover&quot; is a gem.  The best track on the album by far.  &quot;No Lullaby&quot; lyrically is one of the most creative of Ian Anderson's long repertoire: &quot;So come out fighting with your rattle in hand.&quot;  It is nearly 8 minutes long and can be a bit repetitive, though.  &quot;And the Mouse Police Never Sleep&quot; is an odd opening number but a good one.  &quot;One Brown Mouse&quot; is a treat for fans who like the pleasant, acoustical songs.  &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; is almost 9 minutes long.  It is nice but is a little sappy at times.  The band members seem to make fun of this song in the music video.  The sappiest track, however, is &quot;Moths.&quot;  I often have to skip it.  Although I love this album, it is not quite as solid as War Child and earlier Tull releases.
B0000668IF|2.0|I enjoyed Moby's Play, but this album was boring.  It feels empty, like nothing is really driving it.  I gave it away to a friend who likes Moby, and soon they too found little reason to listen to it.  Unfortunate....
B00006JKON|5.0|I read a lot of negative reviews on this album. The main criticism is that it represented a major departure from the early 70s Jethro Tull sound. I became a Tull fan in the late 1980s and purchased their back catalog in a random order so, unlike the long-time fans, I did not hear the same change in sound on this album that others would in 1974 (the year of my birth) who had only heard This Was through A Passion Play. I always enjoyed War Child but, when I was putting a list of my favorite Tull records for amazon and compared it to the others, I realized it was one of my favorite post-Living in the Past albums. It is very solid. Whereas some of Tull's other records have fillers or one or two tracks I don't care for, I can play War Child from start to finish. The only time I cringe is during the last part of the otherwise beautiful \\"Ladies\\". It is a soothing ballad but ends with this silly jazzy rendition of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\". <br />Besides this one complaint, the rest of the tracks are amazing. The heavy use of accordion and tracks like \\"Queen and Country\\" and \\"The Third Hoorah\\" gives the album a sea expedition theme. \\"Bungle in the Jungle,\\" the most familiar track, may be a little too commercial but is still a fun number and probably attracted new fans. \\"Skating Away\\" is beautiful and so is \\"Only Solitaire\\" if you don't pay attention to the crude lyrics. \\"Back-Door Angels\\" and \\"Sea Lion\\" hook together to make a wonderful 9:00 theatrical number. \\"Two Fingers\\" is a version of \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean\\" which is on the boxed 20th anniversary set and is highlighted by excellent acoustic guitar. Of the extra tracks, \\"Rainbow Blues\\" is found on M.U. the Best of Jethro Tull. If you haven't heard it, you're in for a treat. It's one of my favorite Tull tracks. War Child is the last album where you hear Ian Anderson's low, smooth voice. It begins to get a little higher on Minstrel in the Gallery and definitely changes by Songs From the Wood.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Blube' is an exceptionally talented young man with a wonderful voice.  Loved the CD and can't wait for another by Blube'.  I listen on my way to work and home everyday -- and after two weeks have not tired of hearing it over and over.  The sound is smooth and easy and makes me smile.  A CD I'm going to keep for years to come -- and if I wear it out -- I'll gladly buy another.
0151008116|4.0|This beautiful book was marred only by the bogus preface, where Martel lays out a detailed &quot;proof&quot; that the events in the book are true--and the claim it will &quot;make you believe in god.&quot;  Who gives a rip?  <br /><br />These devices only serve to dumb down an otherwise moving and profound story.
0593044703|2.0|I've just finished Gardens of the Moon and I find myself annoyed. Annoyed because the reviews were far too generous (especially those by one of my favourite fantasy authors: Stephen Donaldson); annoyed because the book promised more than it could deliver; but most of all at the way it became so juvenile towards the end.<BR>The characters run here, someone or thing appears from nowhere, incredibly powerful and poised to destroy them until someone else pops up and engages them, freeing the characters to now run there, where someone or thing appears from nowhere, incredibly powerful, poised to destroy - only to have someone else fortunately pop up and engage them... I'm not exaggerating.<BR>This is pathetic. Also infuriating is Erikson's twin penchant for not explaining things properly or clearly and then throwing huge developments at the reader that mean nothing. Examples of the first being Finnest and Azath - what the [heck] were they? Aside, that is, from being incredibly powerful beings poised to destroy until someone else appeared and engaged them...<br />His second failing is particularly well evidenced when, on page 552, we're suddenly told: \\"We're readying ourselves to take on a new player in the game...the Pannion Seer...damn nasty.\\" Who? Where did all this come from? What about resolving the threads we've just spent 500 pages reading about? <BR>Imagine Frodo suddenly turning away from Mordor, and telling a bemused Sam that they must tackle a new threat, (the unscrupulous mushroom-growing Farmer Maggot perhaps) and you get some idea of how gobsmackingly disconcerting this is. Far from heightening the tension, this totally devalues all that's gone before. It's as if Erikson suddenly gave up on the current plot and started to look forward to the next book. <BR>The last 100 pages degenerates into one vastly powerful being running around after another, with the smaller characters always on hand to witness and marvel in the most contrived and irritating manner possible.<BR>There were some good things about the book - the Assassin war, for example - but all the mood-setting is tossed away for one of the daftest climaxes I've ever read. This book has drawn comparisons with George RR Martin's magisterial \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" - that's why I bought it. Don't be deceived. It's poorly written and childish.
0553812173|3.0|Starts with supernatural beings, a battle waged mainly by magic (in fact you wonder what the troops are there for - only to be mown down by waves of sorcery or having bits of moon dropped on their heads?) Then it proceeds to jump around a lot, introducing so many characters and situations that you need a directory to keep them straight. Someone should write the &quot;Reader's Guide to GotM.&quot; But don't get disheartened; keep on ploughing through it and slowly the story begins to take shape. A somewhat odd shape, granted, but worth all the effort in the end - especially since the second and third volumes are so much more readable.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Exciting, to say the least. That's what I have to say about Smallville. Interesting plot twists, great character development and an ultra-cool Lex Luther makes this a DVD worth buying. I can't wait for The WB to release the first season.
B000002JQ6|5.0|I bought this album 11 yrs ago and I still get that exhilerating jolt of energy whenever I listen to it. This was the first AC/DC album I bought and I was pursuaded to do that because I caught This albums   Highway to Hell video  playing on MTV and it impressed me enough to go ahead and buy the CD. I really had  minimal expectations for all other tracks in this CD but, damn as soon as I listened to the opening track of Thunderstruck  A jolt of energy and enlightenment to Rock suddenly streamed through me and I was hooked for life. Every song on here is top notch including Money Talks with the catchy melodic guitar riffs and the great hook on the vocals, TNT with the crowed rythemically chanting \\"Oye\\", Dirty Deeds done dirt cheap, She's got The Jack, and all the old favorites such as Back in Black, You shook me all night long, and  you know all the rest.  <BR>I didnt listen to AC/DC when Bonn Scott fronted the band but, I have heard the recordings of that version of AC/DC and my conclusion is that Brian Johnson is the best thing that could have ever happened to this band. I'm not taking anything away from Bonn Scott's creativity and presense because most of their great songs came from that era however, it seems that Brians vocals lifts this band a notch higher. Brian  infuses an incredible amount of energy and soul  into all AC/DC songs making it Mesh much better into Angus's powerfull riffs then with what Bonn did.   it just seems the current AC/DC  has reached thier potential for making outstanding energy filled Rock Music. I happened to catch their performances of Highway to Hell and She shook me all night long during their rock and roll hall of fame induction ceremony and these guys can still rock as good if not better then any band out their.
B00004YA0T|5.0|This box set is obviously one of the best you can find (besides the Deutsche Grammophon version), conducted by the best Bruckner conductor, Eugen Jochum.<BR>He has strength, character, originality, sensitivity, passion, deeply expressed in his conducting: thrilling, emotional, never dull nor lethargic, even in the slow and quiet moments.<BR>You abandon yourself to the music, you forget everything, just feel the sensuality, the voluptuousness, the dream, the emotion, the depth... and then suddenly, the music rises, explodes violently, stormy, with impressive sounds and accelerated, wild rhythms that make your heart beat faster.
B000063JZQ|5.0|Very true to the play, clever interpretation of \\"desert heath.\\"<BR>Several rubuttles: Violence: yes, much violence that occured onscreen was never meant to, but why did Shakespeare write it such in the first place?  Realistic onstage death/dismemberment was difficult (if not impossible) in the 16oos.  In fact, live violence in modern theatres is still either badly done or heavily stylized.  Youy also must remember, this was the first movie Polanski made after the Manson \\"family\\" raped and mudured his.<BR>Gratuitous nudity: See above.  Also, witches in Victorian times were thought to spend coven meeting naked, so if anything, polanski's version is even more correct than most productions.  Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene was also acurate: sleeping au natural has never been rare.  And remember: the parts of all naked characters that are taboo to film are almost always conveniently covered (such as by the arm of a closer witch, or Lady macbeth's long hair).  The one exception is Lady Macbeth's posterior, but that was only fora few seconds and really isn't all that risque.  The fact that the sleapwalking scene was in at all was surprising: most directors delete it.<BR>Dissapointment:  No Scottish accents.  I know Shakespeare was English, and probably so were the original actors, but the play IS set in Scotland, and a few Scotish accents would have been nice (a minor detail, however).
076790382X|5.0|This book has been hilarious from the first chapter to the last. If anyone can look at American culture (even our dental floss and diapers) and make you laugh about it, Bill Bryson is that man. You owe to yourself to read it- no that's an understatement. If you don't read it, then, as Bryson hillariously states, you will be \\"taken outside and shot.\\" HAHAHAHAHA!
0451167716|5.0|Since 1969 when THE GODFATHER was first published there have been a number of excellent novels and screenplays about the Mafia.  THE GODFATHER is outstanding because it was the first, delving into the internal workings of the Mafia which were not public knowledge at the time.  It is well-written, sustains a lively pace, and intertwines a gang of interesting characters.  My Wise Guy friend warrants that, with a few exceptions such as the whacking of multiple Don's on the same day, THE GODFATHER is accurate as to the internal workings of the Mafia at the time of the story.

B000000H4A|5.0|This classic release starts King Diamond's solo career. 'Fatal Portrait is thrust-through with splenderous organ orchastration, providing for a most mystical embience, &amp; greatly accentuated the stories told therein.<br />The cover is adorned with the site of a 'witch' either burning for her sorcery, or consumed in the fire of her lust. However, being that King Diamond tackles the olde-world problem of xian persecution upon their natural superiors, it is probably the former.<br />On the inner sleeve, KD Himself adorns therein, appearing as if from the distant past, bedecked with pentagrams &amp; inverse crosses, &amp; grasping a goatskull.<br />The songs deal with torment, insanity, curses, superstitions, &amp; ghosts. Always an intrugiung combination!<br />My favorite piece has to be &quot;Halloween&quot;, always desirable all year 'round {&quot;Every night is Halloween...&quot;}<br />There's an instrumental called &quot;From Out Of The Past&quot;, which is delightfully eerie in &amp; of itself.<br />'The Jonah' speaks of the Cornu Curse unleashed upon sailors, sometimes one to another.<br />'Fatal Portrait' is very well entertaining &amp; haunting, &amp; comes off as a morbid novel on tape set to musick, with KD as narrator, story-teller, vox artist, actor, backed by his minstrels.<br />As usual, enter in the timewarp, &amp; be transported to the horrible, &amp; all-too true past.
B000077VT7|3.0|Based on the bestseller by the late Robert Ludlum and executive produced by Ludlum and Frank Marshall, THE BOURNE IDENTITY pares down the book and 1988 miniseries while updating the story for the 21st century. For the few thriller fans in the world who haven't read the book the basic story appears rather old: an amnesiac struggling to learn his real identity, while predictably being pursued by people who want him dead. Director Doug Liman's (GO, SWINGERS) first attempt at an action thriller is fairly good with some spectacular stunt work and an OK performance from Franka Portene (RUN LOLA RUN). Julia Stiles also has what is basically a glorifed cameo and Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lecter also co-stars. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a good movie, but don't expect it to remain true to the book. Apparently there are plans to film THE BOURNE SUPREMACY with Damon. I hope that one turns out a little better. And I hope Damon has developed some kind of acting range by them. His Jason Bourne seems to have been \\"Bourne\\" prematurely. Not that Richard Chamberlain was much better in the role. It's still worth watching though. Don't let my quibbling put you off.
0316776963|5.0|I am truly sorry I successfully ignored what I thought was just a \\"cute\\" bestseller for so long -- poignant and painful, lisping Greek American and French student David Sedaris is a genius of uncomfortably dark but ultimately kindhearted comic timing and the art of the devastating personal essay. Not every chapter forces you to put the book down every three words to recover, but the ones that do are unforgettable. Drug addicted, alcoholic \\"village idiot\\" narcissist or not, David Sedaris' dysfunctional autobiographical sanity does anything but soothe. At a time when embarrassing Americans are eating \\"freedom fries,\\" highly recommended existential therapy.

B000002HMH|3.0|Metallica is my favorite band.  I don't believe in the whole \\"selling out\\" business, but I do believe that the quality of their music has declined a lot in the 90s.  While I happen to think this a pretty good cd, it's easily my least favorite by them and I rarely listen to it.  Yes, it contains a good amount of solid songs.  Bleeding Me is their best 90s song and one of their best songs period.  The Outlaw Torn is quite fantastic as well (especially the S&M version!).  Hero Of The Day is a beautiful little song, King Nothing rocks, Until It Sleeps is very good, and Wasting My Hate is quite solid.  A few other tracks are good, but then you have Ronnie, Cure, and Poor Twisted Me, which I believe to be the worst songs they ever wrote.  Truly terrible, terrible songs.  However, this album is definitely worth buying.  Sure, there are a few stinkers, but there a couple of gems that make this worth the price.  And don't worry folks; St. Anger will be here soon enough to kick everyone's butt once again!
B0000669JL|5.0|Bob Marley was long before my time, he died when I was one week old, but that really does not matter, his music is classic and timeless. This was the first Reggae CD I had ever bought and I think it will probably be the best one I ever get. Fourteen tracks total \\"Legend\\" has a nice mix of songs, love songs, songs about poltics and and oppression, and songs about empoyerment. \\"No Woman No Cry\\" really stands out for me as one of the nicest tracks on the album, a political song about oppression with a powerful chorus that makes you sing along, with a good message which is something along lines of never give up, keep your faith, keep your hope. \\"Three Little Birds\\" has a similar message, and is a melodic feel good song. \\"Buffalo Soldier\\" is a song about slavery and black men fighting for American Independence\\", Bob Marley is dropping some history knowledge on this one, songs got a really catchy sound. \\"Get Up Stand Up\\" uses a heavy bass groove, and is a fast paced track that is about fighting oppression. \\"Stir it up\\" is a relaxed slow love track, which has nice grooves and rhythm.\\"One Love\\" combines piano and guitar, and is a positive feel good song about loving the lord, loving each other. \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" is a powerful song about oppression in Jamaica, first heard this song remixed by Warren G, like this  original alot more. \\"Redemption Song\\" is a sad and wonderful song, about fighting for freedom, Marley uses Acoustic Guitar, and though the song has a sad sound, its deep and moving. \\"Exodus\\" uses organ, continous guitar rifts, and horns, and is a fast paced track. \\"Jamming\\" is a great track to close off the album, a relaxed track with a laid back groovy sound too it. \\"Bob Marley's \\"Legend\\" is an excellent album, and if you are to buy just one Reggae album get this one.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV is known by many names, untitled, runes, Zoso, and so on, and that's part of the mystique around this excellent disk. Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham perfected their blend of hard rock, blues and acoustic folk on this classic disk. The songs are well-crafted without being slickly over-produced, and there is an eclectic mixture of styles that demonstrates that the band members were willing to take risks.<br />The first two songs form a one-two hard rock punch, with the rhythmic puzzle of &quot;Black Dog&quot; and its skanky lyrics followed by the straightahead &quot;Rock and Roll.&quot; &quot;Black Dog&quot; features great guitar/bass/drum timing and some of Page's best electric guitar work, plus some excellent belting by Plant, who uses his voice with great energy and dynamics throughout the song cycle.<br />&quot;Rock and Roll&quot; is pure fun and begs to be cranked up on the car stereo or wherever you're at. Bonham almost has lead drums hear, bashing away at his cymbals and super bass drum work. Jones has some cool piano work underneath, and Page layers some tasty guitar soloing over it all.<br />&quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; takes you back to older times, with a minstrel feel with mandolins and acoustic guitars, plus Robert Plant singing harmony with the well-chosen Sandy Denny. The lyrics have a high fantasy/Middle-Earth imagery (&quot;the ring wraiths ride in black...&quot;) which reflects Page and Plant's interests at the time.<br />In the cleanup spot is the classic &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; which has been overexposed and made into rock caricature (see Wayne's World) but this is still an excellent song. It builds from a simple yet beautiful acoustic guitar melody, gradually layering on more guitars, subtle keyboard textures, and Plant's vocals carrying the mystical ballad through to the end. What's it about? Hope? I'm not even sure, but the words are full of poetic imagery like &quot;in a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.&quot; The song has not just one, but several classic riffs as it builds to its electric finale.<br />As the dust settles, the keyboard intro to &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; takes us to another place, part of a by-gone hippy trippy sixties world, with thundering drums and cool guitar/keyboard interplay by Page and Jones.<br />&quot;Four Sticks&quot; is kind of one riff, droning raga tune that's one of the lesser songs on the disk, but not a bad tune. I like the acoustic part that builds with swirling synths and melody. Excellent drums by Bonham.<br />&quot;Going to California&quot; is another hippy ode, beautiful mandolins and acoustic guitars, gentle melody, and emotional vocals by Plant. Listen to this at sunset on a summer evening.<br />The closer is the simmering blues cruncher &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; which brings all of Led Zeppelin's blues pretensions to completeness, with haunting harmonica, moaning slide guitar, thundering drums and Plant singing blues like Plant instead of an imitation Delta bluesman.<br />This is an essential disk for your collection. &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; is equally impressive, and fans argue back and forth which one is better. Both are worthy.imes all of our thoughts are misgiven.&quot; The song has not just one, but several classic riffs as it builds to its electric finale.<BR>As the dust settles, the keyboard intro to &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; takes us to another place, part of a by-gone hippy trippy sixties world, with thundering drums and cool guitar/keyboard interplay by Page and Jones.<BR>&quot;Four Sticks&quot; is kind of one riff, droning raga tune that's one of the lesser songs on the disk, but not a bad tune.

B000001F9E|5.0|I really love Thin Lizzy, but I'm not that dogmatic! I have no problem admitting that the early releases sure were uneven and sometimes horrible. But \\"Jailbreak\\" is a real masterpiece, including their biggest hit ever - \\"The boys are back in town\\". On this release, Lynott and the boys deliver songs of such high quality it's hard to find an overall better album. The material doesn't blend together since every single song has its unique character. Just listen to the amazing melodic \\"Running back\\", \\"Angel from the coast\\", and \\"Romeo and the lonely girl\\". The harder \\"Jailbreak\\", \\"Warrior\\", and \\"Emerald\\". And don't forget the beautiful \\"Cowboy song\\".<br />It's a mystery to me how Thin Lizzy have been over looked. They are clearly one of the best rock bands in history.
B000006MS3|5.0|'The Dreaming' is an album which improves immeasurably after a few plays. Like most of her releases it is a slow-burner, but slow-burners are often the ones that end up being the best albums. <BR>This is most definately the case with 'The Dreaming'.<BR>All of the songs on this record are full of lyrics which would perhaps puzzle anyone but Bush herself - \\"Suddenly my feet are feet of mud, it all goes slow mo, I don't know why Im crying, Am I suspended in gaffa' from 'Suspended In Gaffa' being a prime example of this, although it is no bad thing - it actually increases the interest in the songs.<BR>What it clearly is, is an album contained of fury, death and eroticism. Its heavy stuff at times, perhaps with the exception of 'There Goes A Tenner', a tale of bank robbery and such, but even this has an undercurrant of resentment.<BR>This being the first album Bush produced alone, it seems as if she had all but forgotten her three previous LPs. The songs have been made in a way that suggests that all other forms of music never existed and that the structure and writing of song is something completly new. A grand statement indeed, but no other record - including any of her own - has ever being created resembling this one (I could be mistaken, but I know for a fact that nothing before it did).<BR>There are really no poor tracks on this album, they all bask in a unique and touching brilliance, the unspeakably gorgeous 'Night Of The Swallow' perhaps being the best on the album. This is by far the best record I have ever bought, it stinks that it didn't do as well as some of her other stuff but absolutely worth a listen.

B00006IUL7|4.0|The initial, basic plot of INSOMNIA is fairly conventional.  Al Pacino, a tired, grizzled cop, and his partner, come to Alaska to help solve a particularly heinous murder.  They're chasing a psycho.  Right there is enough story for many movies.<br />But this movie isn't satisfied with anything conventional.  When Pacino comes close to capturing the bad guy, he makes a HUGE mistake and then makes the bigger mistake of covering up for himself...and is witnessed in this crime by the murderer himself.  Thus, Pacino must now track the murderer to also prevent his secret from getting out.  Does this mean killing the murderer?<br />The movie is set in Alaska, during the time of year when the sun isn't setting.  Pacino can't get to sleep, and his guilt-ridden insomnia seeps into his performance in a nearly tangible way.  We see his ever increasing weariness.  He's a good cop who may have taken some shortcuts in the past, but we sense that he's smart and on the right side.  His mistake was an accident followed by a lapse in judgement.  But as his weariness covers him, we feel his despair for his soul.<br />It's rare to see a \\"crime\\" movie that delves so deeply into the psyche of its main characters.  This is truly a great Pacino performance...he doesn't go over the top, and we understand once again why he's one of our greats.  Robin Williams excellently plays the psycho-killer.  He's not as creepy as he was in ONE HOUR PHOTO, but he is very effective, and makes an unusual foil for Pacino.  Hillary Swank plays the local law officer who admirers Pacino, even as she begins to question his story.  Martin Donovan plays Pacino's partner in a small part that he carries off VERY well.  This guy needs more high profile parts.<br />The movie doesn't move at a very brisk pace, but for intelligent, adult movie goers, it is jam-packed with psychological action. And there is very nice chase scene about halfway through, where Pacino is pursuing Williams over a river covered with logs.  It's something we've not seen in a movie before.  The whole movie is pretty unique, in fact, and I highly recommend it!
0553381407|5.0|This is not an easy book.  It is not a book that will make you feel good.  It certainly is not a book to replace therapy.  What it is is a great start on a long difficult journey.  Using examples from her practice, Forward explains what toxic parents are and how they can happen to families.  She explains the dynamics of dysfunctional families and how they will play roles that are assigned to the various members of a family.  What surprised me the most was how she explained how a family can turn its back on the injured party to protect the toxic parent.  It is one way a family copes.  Not everybody is happy when the problem is challenged.  If you are buying this book for yourself to help with a past, this book will give insights to what you can expect from others in the family.  If your are buying this book for general knowledge, you will be surprised how much of your own family can show up in these pages. Forward talks about archetypes and these are present in all families in some degree.  She also spends time explaining about enablers and how they also are part of the problem in a dysfuntional family.  Forward does write about succeses and about failures.  This is very important work she has done.  This is not a book for enjoyment, but it can be appreciated later on especially if you are working through problems.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Even though I am a live theatre fan and have seen the show on stage, I thought the movie was amazing.  Of course the vocals and choreography were fabulous, but what I especially liked was the lighting and special effects.  Most stage plays don't make it on the big screen, but Chicago did it all!  Kudos to everyone in the cast and crew!
B00000IFWE|2.0|It feels like Tom Petty is trying to do something else (or new?) on this release, but most of the time it's just not any good. I miss the melodies I fell in love with and I think the material on \\"Echo\\" is quite monotonous and uninteresting with the exception of \\"Room at the top\\", \\"Counting on you\\" and \\"Accused of love\\". If you compare this with albums like \\"Full moon fever\\", \\"The great wide open\\" or \\"The last DJ\\", it's clearly not as good.

0743455967|5.0|Stephen King's quirky style of writing had me in the first chapter.  He really bares his soul and humiliation as a writer in the first part of this book, from working jobs to survive, to rejections, to finally getting published and the elation that followed.  As a writer, I could really relate to this part of the book.<br />The second part is filled with the basics of storytelling for struggling writers seeking publication.  He writes in a no-nonsense fashion and does not cushion his words or advice.  He uses his own life of writing as examples of the lessons he conveys to the reader.<br />Over all, this book was probably the most delightful and helpful book for writers that I've ever read.  I call it the writer's bible and I believe every writer, struggling or published, should own a copy of this marvelous guide.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I think what truly emanates from this movie is its presentation of the human condition from a glorious perspective, that of a guru's, guised as a simple man. Alas, Forrest Gump's mental handicap is much more than an edge for characterization, it's a gift offered to the audience from which they can understand the world as Gump sees it. From there, the world is transormed to a less torturous place, one that isn't remembered for it's cruel wars and its petty insecurities, but for its beautiful landscapes and attachments to love.<br />His conclusions are less childlike than they are optimistic and forward-looking; he's less oblivious than he is empathetic. His ability to focus on the simple beauties of life instead of its horrors is way past what we're capable of. Forrest Gump is a man way ahead of our time, and if we're lucky we can all see the world as he does.<br />If you dont already agree, watch the movie one more time, and keep these assertions in mind. I'm sure some of you will figure him less ignorant and more insightful than most.
B00003CWL6|5.0|- That would also have been an appropriate title for this brilliant film. From the very beginning the viewer is given the outcome, but the journey is so consuming that we forget.<br />The movie's plot draws out the life of Lester as an unhappy and perhaps incompetent father who is depressed by his wife's lack of affection and a job that is eating away at his life - all the synopsis of his mid-life crisis. <br />I won't give away the movie, because I hate it when people do the same to me. But the dream sequences, the revelation of American suburbia's lies and pretenses that we accept every day, the sheer power of a person who actually lives his life, and the forgotten concept of what is happiness - all carefully crafted and tied together makes this DVD a masterpiece.

B00005R87Q|1.0|Wow, what a corny, insipid, annoying piece of junk! This flashy, gaunt and desolate mess of a movie has captured the attention of preteens all across the country. They like the fast pretty cars and the bright lights and the &quot;hott bods&quot;. Those children fail to recognize the bleak material that's shoved in their face. The cheezy dialogue, the paper mache acting, the middleschool direction, the ungodly actors (ugh Vin), the contaminated &quot;plot&quot; that's been recycled over and over and over again. There's nothing fresh or refreshing here.<br />No doubt all the little Vin Deisel-groupies are gonna scorn this review. Hey, I'm just speaking truth here. Look facts in the face; if you actually enjoy this testosterone-fueled garbage, you're clearly void of any intelligence and common sense.
0783225849|5.0|I saw this when it first came out, with my brother, and we were 12 and 15, respectively...of course, it shocked adults at the time (as well as today) but it REALLY had an impact on us! Back in 1960, there simply was nothing around to compare, as this movie opened new ground in horror, and even in black and white, it was chilling, perhaps even more so...Janet Leigh was superb, and notice her expression when she is driving away with the money from the man at the bank, who flirted with her, and her thoughts as to how he would react when he discovered the theft. There was another scene, not the shower one, which scared me to death, and the buildup to it was agonizing. In fact, every time we had to go into the Bates house, I was a wreck. When one man complained to Hitchcock that his wife, after seeing the movie, refused to take showers, the Master replied: \\"Have her dry cleaned...\\" The Highway Patrol cop who follows her, with great suspicion, is fabulous, his sunglasses obscuring his eyes, and his thoughts, and the car salesman, who is also suspicious and somewhat put off by her desperation...Norman Bates, with his collection of taxidermy, is great, and Perkin's performance here is all the more remarkable considering his previous filmwork was in \\"Friendly Persuasion\\", playing the good Quaker son...and Martin Balsam, as the detective helping Vera Miles find her sister, was excellent, and one of my favorite lines of his, to Bates: \\"It doesn't gel, it isn't aspic...\\" flatly doubting his contention that he never met or knew the lady in question. I am definitely getting the DVD collector's edition, and plan to watch it during our next thunderstorm, as if it needed more atmosphere! Enjoy...

B000000I0Q|3.0|This is Steve Hackett's first solo album, recorded BEFORE he left Genesis.  There are several good songs here, but Hackett seems to be using the album to get his feet wet and explore the range of his songwriting ability.  He hadn't yet developed the signature sound that peaked on &quot;Spectral Mornings&quot; and &quot;Defector&quot;.  &quot;Ace of Wands&quot; is the standout track here.  Hackett's brother John, who later became a regular member of his band, plays flute.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B000002U9W|3.0|Pink Floyd before 1973's Dark Side of the Moon was very drastically different from the band we all know and love. They didn't seem to have as much of a direction, and were really too experimental for their own good.<br />Pretty much, the deal with this record is that the title track is really pretty cool. Without it, the album would be a flop. With its 20-plus-minute length, it is not surprising that it drags in places, but it is very creative. The main motif of the song, with the horn section, is really awesome. The choral group is pretty cool usually, but I personally think it is pretty stupid when they start shouting nonsense words. Oh, did I mention that the whole song is instrumental?<br />After this song, it honestly gets pretty boring. &quot;If&quot; is very unimaginative, and is the worst of the middle three songs, although I do congratulate Roger Waters for his correct usage of the subjunctive mood (very rarely correctly used in rock music)! The next song, &quot;Summer '68&quot;, is the best of the middle three, and it is actually quite good if you let it sink in. It is the most upbeat moment of the album, and trust me, as much as I love Pink Floyd, it is good for them to have some upbeat songs here and there. I haven't listened to this album in a little while, and to be quite honest, I don't really remember much of &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; except some segments of the lyrical part. Consequently, I have come to the conclusion that the song is not very distinguishable.<br />The last song, &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot;, is pitiful. It goes nowhere, and just drifts along with no hooks, no real melody even. It is terribly boring to the point that it is unlistenable. I guess it was the 70's, so they were aloud to do some weird stuff like this, but this track is over 10 minutes long. This is simply unforgivable.<br />But to end on a high note, the title track is one of the best pre-1973 Pink Floyd songs, and, if you are a fan, it makes the whole album worth buying. So, if you are into Pink Floyd, buy this record for &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; and &quot;Summer '68&quot;. If you are a Floyd skeptic, this will only serve to turn you farther away from their music.

B000002KHH|5.0|Paranoid is considered one of those albums that any fan of 70's music, hard rock, or even just rock and roll music should defnitely own. It has gone down in history, and many people would say it is the \\"greatest album in metal history.\\" Although I would not go that far, it is certainly way up there. I personally think that Black Sabbath had better albums, but this is absolutely the most accessible.<br />4 of the 8 songs are highly recognizable - I have heard them played on classic rock and modern rock radio stations. These are \\"Paranoid,\\" \\"Iron Man,\\" \\"War Pigs,\\" and \\"Fairies Wear Boots.\\" The title track is probably the band's most famous song ever. This is understandable; it is undeniably catchy, upbeat, hard-driving, and short enough to be played frequently on the radio (under 3 minutes!) Actually, this short song length is pretty rare for Black Sabbath, who is known for their long, epic compositions. There is nothing bad I can say about this song, it is definitely the most commercially successful Sabbath song, and for good reason.<br />The main riff of \\"Iron Man\\" is nothing short of monumental. This song is THE DEFINITIVE Black Sabbath song. It is one of the most powerful, if not THE most powerful riff in metal history. The song has brilliant innovative guitar work throughout; its 6 minutes are consistently filled with innovation and virtuosity. This is not to say that the musicians are profoundly talented; it is just that they do things with rock music that have never been done before (this is 1970!). Basically, if you are not familiar with \\"Iron Man,\\" there is something seriously wrong with your upbringing.<br />\\"War Pigs\\" is anti-war song that shines with epic brilliance. It opens the album with a slow, Sabbath-trademarked groove, before exploding into its signature stop-and-go verse, with Ozzy screaming about destruction and death and whatnot. This song has probably the best guitar work on the album, and the arrangements are wonderful. The long instrumental sections of the song are perfect, Iommi truly was (is) one of the great guitarists of rock music.<br />\\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" is the last song on the album, and is one of my personal favorite Sabbath songs of all time. It is quite clearly about LSD-tripping (at one point he sees fairies that wear boots). The lyrics are on the verge of being comical (especially the part about going to the doctor), but I find that this does not take away from the music at all. In fact, it only helps to make it as great as it is. The opening of the song is one of the most psychedelic musical passages in all of Sabbath's music, and the rest of the song is carried by a hard-driving riff.<br />Those four songs are the ones that the average person has probably heard. (It is ironic that from a band with one of the longest careers ever, their 4 most recognizable songs are from one album.) However, let's not forget about the other half of the album! The remaining four songs are phenomenal. \\"Planet Caravan\\" is very mellow, with some great jazz-guitar playing from Tony Iommi. The lyrics are very dream-like and beautifully written, despite their elementary quality. \\"Electric Funeral\\" is sludge metal in its earliest form. It is a great song, and its lyrics are probably the most definitive of any Sabbath song ever. \\"Rat Salad\\" is a great instrumental song, and it has a great drum solo from Bill Ward. \\"Hand of Doom\\" is a popular one among fans of the band, and for good reason; it starts with a slow crawling bass riff, as Ozzy sings about the dangers of drug abuse. Suddenly, the song erupts, the volume cranks up, the distortion pedal is kicked, and the same riff becomes monstrous.<br />All four members of the band have a recognizable sound. Ozzy, of course, has his trademark voice, I don't even have to talk about that. Iommi's guitar playing rarely departs from the notes in the pentatonic minor scale, but he pulls it off so well. His soloing is very simple, but very effective. Geezer Butler's bass styleis great, he does a lot of improvisation, sometimes complementing the guitar and sometimes doubling it. Bill Ward has a signature blues-rock drum groove that he plays in pretty much all the songs. Although none of the musicians are ground-breaking in their abilites, they are certainly ground-breaking in their styles.<br />Once again, Black Sabbath has better albums (check out Vol. 4 and Heaven and Hell), but none are as definitive as this one. Rock on!

0440237688|4.0|The book The Giver is a fun and interesting novel. It tells of the future being a perfect place. There is no pain, no colors, and no freedom of choice. Everything is just sameness and nobody can judge any person because of their differences. In every community, there is a person who holds all the memories of pain and pleasure. Every once in a while, a twelve year old would be chosen to be the Receiver of Memory<BR> Jones, the main character of the book, is chosen to be the next receiver of memory. At first, he was very scared because the person who announced him being the receiver said that he will experience pain. When he started his first day of training, he felt it wasnt really bad. On the first day, he met the trainer who calls himself the giver. The giver is a very old man, and he is very kind to Jones. Jones now finds himself learning about the true meaning of life.<BR> My favorite part of the story is when the giver gives Jones the memory of a really good Christmas. The memory is described as a very warm and loving memory. Through the memory, Jones saw a fireplace, windows with snow outside, and grandparents. That day was the first time Jones has ever seen children with their grandparents. I liked that part because it shows the true love of humans. That was my favorite part of the book so far. <BR> That reason why I chose this book is because my brother suggested it to me. He told me that the book was good when I was in fifth grade. But at that time, I didnt really like to read, so I abandoned the book. Then this year, I finally realized that reading is fun, so I checked out the book from the library. After I started the first page, I liked it. So now Im almost done with the book.
B000002KDO|5.0|When this album first came out and I was a mere boy, an elderly Jewish couple gave it to me as a present.

1563890119|4.0|I picked up &quot;Sandman&quot; on a whim, after hearing its name mentioned with such titles as &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;Preacher&quot;. After reading the first volume, , I must confess I'm a little disappointed.<br />Niel Gaiman is a great writer. I have to mention that first and foremost. When he cowrote a book with Terry Pratchett, the world must have rejoiced.  Unfortunately, the start of &quot;Sandman&quot; leaves some to be desired. It's not that it's a bad storyline or anything. It's simply that it's not a gripping enough introduction. The following tales, with a special note to &quot;24 Hours&quot; are much better.<br />The real problem, that which really cost the work a star, is the art. Stopping just shy of hideous, the art is sloppy, badly planned and bemusingly arrainged on the page. I'm thankful that other artists come on in later volumes. While the drawings themselves don't improve much, their arraingment does, so much so that it's not a trial to read a single page.<br />&quot;Sandman&quot; is definitely worth buying. It's good enough to buy a second volume and perhaps even more than that.<br />&quot;FAT PIGEONS!&quot;
0465011020|5.0|\\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" by Kang Chol-Hwan is a great book even if you have no specific interest in Korea. The book's universal appeal is its story of a person who survives a disastrous early life to escape by guile and fortitude to a better world he wasn't even sure existed.<br />Kang also provides a rare view inside the most secretive society of the contemporary era.  He reveals a North Korea [DPRK] that is more accurately described as a criminal conspiracy rather than the most pure communist state in history.  Communism serves as more a pseudo-religious enabling device for Kim Il-Song, his successor Kim Jong-Il, and their henchmen in this hyper-fascist state.  To this end, communism worked better than the old style Hitler/Mussolini fascism if you were at the top.  For the masses either system was a catastrophe.  Kang provides vast evidence of this.  Kang is also proof positive that the people of the North are not purely the brainwashed victims of communism that the rest of us have been led to believe.<br />The DPRK will go down in history as serving no useful purpose other than as a warning of the depths of depravity people are capable of, [while most of the world looks the other way].<br />Other reviewers note similarities to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's \\"The Gulag Archipelago\\" [a.k.a. the literary tombstone of the USSR] and I agree. I add, and recommend, \\"MiG Pilot\\" by John Barron & \\"Anthem\\" by Ayn Rand as related books. \\"MiG Pilot\\" tells the true story of another disenchanted communist, Viktor Belenko.  \\"Anthem\\" is more a nightmare version of a pure-communist future society. The struggles and ultimate personal victories portrayed in \\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" and \\"MiG Pilot\\" may prevent the rest of us from living in the world of \\"Anthem\\".

B000067G3C|5.0|Director Jan de Bont (who crafted the brilliant cinematography for the original Die Hard) helmed this 1994 smash hit that, like Die Hard, would set the standard for hundreds of following action films, and, also like Die Hard, made a superstar out of it's lead, Keanu Reeves.  Reeves plays an L.A. cop who gets in the path of a crazed bomber with an agenda (Dennis Hopper in psycho mode), and eventually winds up on a rigged bus that will explode if it falls below 50 MPH.  The frentic action is carried at a speedy (no pun intended) pace, and Reeves carries the film on his shoulders, while Hopper gives a great performance as well and you can tell that this guy is in his element with his role.  Speed also features the star making performance of Sandra Bullock as a pivotal bus passenger, and we also get smaller, but nonetheless important, roles from Jeff Daniels, Joe Morton, and Glenn Plummer.  Naturally, since Speed was such a sucess, a sequel was released (Reeves wisely elected not to star in it because \\"he didn't want to get typecast as an action star\\", yet this is the guy in the bankable Matrix trilogy, go figure, maybe he got an advance of the sequel's script) with Jan de Bont at the helm, but didn't carry an ounce of the magic that this action classic does.  20th Century Fox has done another fantastic job with this Five Star Collection DVD; it's packed with extras including an insightful commentary from de Bont and it even has the rarely seen Billy Idol music video for the film's theme song.  All in all, Speed more than deserves a spot in your action library, and it did what the original Die Hard did 15 years ago; revolutionize the genre.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|If you have seen Pi, you'll love this one. (I find both movies to be groundbreaking, almost of a class at par with Stanley Kubrick of yore). Aronofsky, a meticulous director, uses some very original techniques to set the tone and convey the themes within this sometimes dark but always beautiful, complex depiction of the nature of addiction.<br />Through use of split screens, revolving cameras, extreme close-up, distorted angles, blasting sound, and repetitive symbols, all in an effort to convey the actual experience of the substance-user under the influence. The film is a visceral experience, unrelenting in its portrayal of each character's descent into their own personal abyss.<br />The film focuses on three main characters: a Jewish mother from Brooklyn, Sara Goldfarb, played by Ellen Burstyn, the son, Harry, played by Jared Leto, and the girlfriend, Marion, played by Jennifer Connelly. Mom is addicted first to television, and as a result of a proposed appearance on her favorite show, decides to lose weight with the aid of diet drugs, prescribed by an unethical physician. Harry and Marion are fond of heroin, but they will settle for something amphetamine in a pinch. All three start out as casual users, but as they persist with their addictions, each character's environment deteriorates and they all sink deeper into unreality. Aronofsky portrays this by having the characters interact with each other in a relatively normal way at first, focusing on the familial relationship between mother and son, and the romantic one between Harry and Marion.<br />The early scenes are brightly lit and pleasant to watch, with many shots of the gorgeous Leto and Connelly lying head-to-head, looking remarkably alike, awash in drugs and love. Even the screen-wide use of the symbols and sounds of drug use seem exhilarating and exciting at first, and it is not until the viewer is bombarded with them relentlessly that they become uncomfortable to watch and hear. Aronofsky splits the film into three parts, subtitled Summer, Fall, and Winter. The seasons change along with the characters, and as time progresses, the characters split from each other, each advancing more deeply into their own addiction and despair. Their individual descents parallel each other, which Aronofsky represents by quick cutting from one character's current predicament to the others, all the scenes infused with garish colors, murky lighting, and disquieting music. At one point Aronofsky unites the characters by showing the visual similarities between the bloodshot, bruised, and terrified eyes of the mother, the heavily made-up, smeared and bleary eyes of Marion, and the infected, bloody and blackened wound that Harry grows on his inner arm.<br />The performances in this film are top-notch, especially from Ellen Burstyn, as a perfectly actualized suburban junkie. Her character is really the sympathetic one, caught not in a desire to get high, but just to be a little more attractive -- a trait so typical of our media-fed society. Also notable in his role is Marlon Wayans, playing against type in a non-comedic role as Harry's drug buddy.<br />In a conventional drug film, the addict usually dies, as a morality play, or to accomplish some finality for the storyline. Aronofsky refuses to go for the easy way out. The last twenty minutes of this film possess some of the most harrowing footage you will ever see, and there is no respite for the viewer or the characters.<br />A definite 5-star and one for your collection!into three parts, subtitled Summer, Fall, and Winter.

0393317552|2.0|I bought this book in an airport newsstand prior to an 11 hour flight.  As a firearms designer and history major, I thought it would touch on the basis for my thesis that \\"Development of Firearms Launched the Industrial Revolution.\\"; boy was I ever wrong.<br />At points it's fairly compelling, yet midway through the PC pablum it's just a case of having [$$] invested and half the pages gone and 5 more hours to kill on the flight!<br />His arguments become ridiculous.  He cites that African animals were incapable of being domesticated, ignoring the fact that water buffalos and rhinos can tame down easier than a Jersey Cow!<br />He writes off Elk, Wapiti, and Caribou being unable to be domesticated by \\"Native Americans\\" yet their genetic equivalents (Reindeer) have been domesticated by the Finns and Icelanders for centuries!  Climate and predators are equal in all instances, the only difference is the people!<br />His obsession with the tribesmen of New Guinea contained some interesting points and that is where the book was possibly worth the price and why I gave it 2 stars.

078401213X|5.0|Low budget. Grainy black and white as you may already know from other reviews, so hardly a &quot;movie&quot; in the common sense of the word. Quaint sound effects. Oddball character in the lead. But boring? Not quite.<br />To begin with, there's a narrative which (almost) makes sense. This makes Pi an altogether more intriguing and absorbing film than David Lynch's forerunner, which was rather up its own alimentary canal anyway.<br />Pi is what a Prodigy video would be like if directed by someone from the Smithsonian Institute. The thumping soundtrack is extremely effective in that it is totally incongruous to the subject matter (a mathematician has a breakdown). It's rather like having The Carpenters doing a soundtrack for Rambo.<br />Neatly edited, thoughtful, and brave (you try making the pitch sound exciting). Stick with it for 10 minutes and you'll sit through the whole of it.<br />And even if you don't like it, it's only 85 minutes long. Give it a try.

B000002J09|5.0|Yes there is not one bad song on this cd. Yes the first 2 are classic rock anthems which can now be heard in car commercials. Yes the last track is a kick-butt rockin' bluesy display of guitar playing. However all of the other 7 tracks seem superfluous, even unnecessary to the band's greatest song: Stairway to Heaven. Almost like Ravel's 17 minute Crescendo \\"Bolero,\\" Stairway builds from a few simple notes (possibly the most famous intro in Rock) to the jam of the century at the end. Buy the album. For stairway. But not just for stairway. Just buy it.

B00006F83Y|5.0|As someone who draws more toward hip-hop, jazz and dance music, I don't know what the appeal is in this album, but Songs for the Deaf is one of the best albums I've ever heard. Queens put together a definitive album, and a definitive performance!<br />Like Thelonious Monk did with jazz in the 70s, it is possible to have a band doing a dead genre.
6304698623|5.0|This review is from a guy who sees almost every movie<BR>in the theatre and likes very few of them.

038572179X|4.0|Ian McEwan is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.  With the exception of Philip Roth, who is so good he could probably get short-listed for the Pulitzer every time he writes his grocery list on the back of an envelope, McEwan is the only author I know who has produced such consistently excellent fiction.  Amsterdam, his Booker-winning novel just a few years ago, was a tough act to follow, but Atonement, which just nabbed the National Book Critics Circle Award, is a worthy successor.  This is what great writing is all about.<br />The plot of Atonement is richly layered and textured.  In part one of the novel, McEwan builds powerful sense of tension through his re-telling of the story from the perspectives of various different characters.  We are presented with a set of events, allowed to absorb, analyze, and judge them, and then we are presented with the same set of events molded from a different point of view, forcing us to re-examine them in this new context.  McEwan fills the narrative with mystery, passion, intrigue, and a whole range of complex personal emotions.  Part one could easily stand on its own as a novella.  The character of Briony is superbly developed.  She goes from being a precocious yet sympathetic focus of the reader's affection to a manipulative, conniving, stubborn brat whose moral lapse has disastrous, long-term consequences for several other characters.  But wait, that's just the first 100 pages!  McEwan then layers two more stories on top of this one - a powerful tale of the personal struggle of a WWII soldier retreating from the battle of Dunkirk, and stoic suffering of a young nurse in a military hospital, witnessing some of the worst injuries imaginable.  Both plots are gripping.<br />And what a graceful ending, bringing the novel full circle, 64 years later, back to where it began.  Few novels bring me to the verge of tears, but this one did.<br />I especially liked the critical analysis he offered on the creative process that a writer goes through.  Briony's reflections early on about her own efforts at fiction, and later on the thoughtful letter from the literary journal to which she submits her work, really added a lot to this novel.  It's great to get an honest, detailed assessment from a writer about his craft, and this one comes from the one of the best in the business.writer goes through.

0375758992|4.0|Great book, very interesting and attention-holding.  Although some parts were confusing and the writer's style is a bit &quot;jumpy&quot;, late in the book you realize the chapters are scenes  from her life, in chronological order, but not necessarily connected.  I would recommend this book though as it depicts a life most unlike most people's.
B000089RVX|1.0|How to describe such an eclectic mix of beautifully lush vocal anguish, crushing nu-metal guitars, and haunting synthesizers? I get chills up my spine listening to this. Don't hesitate to get this album if you want something totally fresh, invigorating, enthralling, and terrifying all at the same time!!!
0780619951|2.0|okay, i like sci fi, i like psychological thrillers, i like drama, i generally like screwed up movies and this movie fills all of that BUT other than the acting which i must say Fairuza Balk did a beautiful job as Aissa (she was my reason for seeing it, ive loved her since i was 8 when i saw \\"best christmas paegent ever\\" and now im 23 and she still amazes me) and also that val kilmer did a great job as well and well brando,  im not even gonna comment on that i mean hes marlon brando.<BR>BUT this movie made me want to hurl!  not for anyone with a weak stomache, there is alot of cruelty to animals in this movie and they show it all.. (im sure its all done without really harming any animals but this is modern day work people, it looks like real animals being ripped apart and disected on and such..<br />okay, its this movie about this guy who gets sent off to this island where he finds this old guy, a demented doctor named Dr. Moreau and he discovers that Dr. Moreau is mixing human and wild animal genes to create a race of highly inteligent animals so to speak.  By which he is taking them as children and belittleing them along with taking away their choices and giving them a life of confusion and torment.  This guy who comes to the island meets a beautiful young woman named Aissa only to discover that the woman he is smitten over as well as being his new friend is actually a \\"manamal\\" in an early stage of turning.  As time goes on she gets embarrased because her features begin to change, her eyes take on the formation like a leopard (half her geneology), her fangs grow, and so forth. though she is a sincerely loving person, which you know early on that no matter how she changes the kindness in her will not change.  shes actually the one thing that kept me watching this movie, not only because Fairuza but because the character is so amazing, though i have to say i wasnt crazy about the movie. well, the man/imals discover what all has been done with genetics and they start a war to destroy the people who took their right to live and turned them into creatures that no one will love and that the world will always hate. ive seen it twice, i never bought it, probly never would but i do think that if you have a strong stomache that it is worth renting or if your into really screwed up movies maybe buying it used on vhs for pretty cheap but it didnt impress me much.
B00003CXB4|5.0|From reviews that i've read, list of extras, and overall history of the film, this is going to be THE best DVD ever made to date!  'The Lion King' has to be one of the best movies ever made and deffinatly THE best animated one.  I can't wait to get my paws on my DVD... i'll never let it stop spinnin!  TLK means so much to me and I hope plenty others fell the same i do now, and/or when they see the all new DVD with added extras.  I can't wait!  Hurry up October 7th!!!
0316666343|5.0|I delayed getting The Lovely Bones, because the subject matter sounded so depressing.  And it was, but it was also uplifting.  And the end, the final sentence, gave me such a rush I started crying.  DON'T PEEK AHEAD.  It will mean nothing to you unless it is read in context.<br />I'm currently reading Lucky by the same author.  Also depressing subject, but just as wonderfully written as The Lovely Bones.  I love this author!
0815332181|4.0|I definitely agree with other reviews above that MBOC is still the best textbook in the field of cell biology. It is widely used as a textbook for both undergraduate and graduate level courses. This edition of MBOC is coming with several changes in chapters related to molecular biology. According to the authors, six chapters on molecular biology may be considered a seperate textbook. Yet, personally, I think that those relevant chapters is too simple and confusing and their arrangement is somewhat not clear, as well. Generally, MBOC is absolutely the best textbook on cell biology, but not on molecular biology.
B000065U1N|5.0|I felt the movie was well done. The action sequences were well played out and realistic. A lot of time obviously went into the authenticity. Mr. Cody, You missed the point! When a &quot;civilian &quot; picks up a gun and starts firing at american soldiers they are not a civilian anymore, they are a combatant. You obviously haven't been in the military! I didn't see any innocent bystanders get killed in the movie! War is ugly and I think this was a pretty accurate account of this particular skirmish.<BR> Hopefully they will come out with another edition with DTS and the history channel's documentary.
B000002LND|5.0|Although this is one of my 5 favorite CDs ever including GHV2, this 'Immaculate collection' definately had room for 3 or 4 more. 'causing a commotion' 'Angel' 'True Blue' 'Burning up' 'Everybody' 'Oh father' and much more top 20's had room here, 21 songs would have been more apitizing...the songs that were chozen were great though, I like all Madonna songs, and love most of them. This is a timeless collection of Madonna's best from her early career.
B00006ADG8|5.0|This is a movie about duty.  With excellent performances by all it illustrates the great trap of power, the fact that you have to do your job no matter what.  This can be seen in the character of Captain Veer.  He doesn't want to do what he has to do with Billy Budd, he knows it is the right thing to do.  Can he bring himself to complete his job even though he doesn't want to do it?  Can he bring himself to carry out justice even though Billy was provoked and was totally justified in his crime?  This is type of movie that will make you think about basic facts of human nature.  <br />My impression good movie that sticks to the book
B00003CXXM|3.0|This movie is a must-rent,nothing more nothing less! It was ok, but I thought the story was going to be so much more interesting/deeper. I mean I hate to give the story away so I wont say what happened. But its not as \\"conspiracy-Don't Trust Anybody\\" type of story. Its more like the CIA trying to correct a mission gone wrong, so to speak. And the Alternate Endings are basicly the same as the original, they'll just change like if Matt Damon Runs or walks, or what he has in his hand, etc. And the Deleted scenes just shows wasted footage, not really missing anything. I'd say Rent this.
1587990717|5.0|Fooled by Randomness is to-the-point and amusing to boot.  Taleb makes a persuasive argument without resorting to ponderous logic or mindbending mathematical formulae (which I am sure he could have done, basis the brilliant Dynamic Hedging).  The book is quick and witty in describing how we underestimate randomness in our lives.  An original and refreshing read.
1587990717|5.0|This book is a very charming literary essay on probability. I bought plenty of copies of it and I distribute it to people to prevent them from becoming arrogant.<BR>5 stars (the max!)
B00006CXSS|5.0|&quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is hands down the finest thing I have ever seen on a television screen over a 50+ year period.<br />Perhaps I was especially moved because I am an old paratrooper (but not WW II and not 101st Airborne Division) and could identify a little with the great men of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.  Such identification is necessarily limited for one must be in awe of those who endured such unimaginable hardship and suffering and who served so heroically for such an extended period.<br />The segues from interviews of the actual, now aging, heroes to the most realistic battle scenes ever recorded was masterfully done.  The actors, all new faces to me, were flawless in their performances.  I laughed, I cursed, I cried, I was stirred by every episode, every scene of this incredible series.<br />Easy Company citizen-warriors, I salute you and hope that you will never be forgotten, thanks to Spielberg and Hanks.
B00008977N|1.0|I guess I don't hate it BUT...I bought this because of all the great reviews I saw on Amazon.com...I hear know great musicians here, there ok, but nothing extrordinary...Some reviewer said the stage was great or something...wow...A tree comes up...and a dome comes down...I say this performance and DVD is a master of mediocrity...
0446677450|4.0|I've read RDPD twice despite John Reed's ripping of RTK.  The book is insightful and mostly focuses on how you think of money and finances.  As a result of reading this book, I've adopted the &quot;pay your self first&quot; habit that many other financial books have often advocated; I've heard it before but never had the inclination to do it.The only thing that I found somewhat annoying and irritating is that RTK conveys the idea of &quot;the rich&quot; as a group of people who are apart from the rest of us mortals; like a special group that only a select few can get into; a &quot;Those People&quot; or &quot;Them&quot; mentality.This first book lays down the foundation of Rich Dad philosophy. The next books breaks down all the concepts and ideas mentioned in this first one.
0380789019|5.0|Even though I read &quot;Neverwhere&quot; several years ago (this was my first Gaiman book), I decided to re-read it to refresh my memory, so I could write this review. Even after all this time, this is still my favorite book by Neil Gaiman. I even lent it to my sister beforehand, and she finished it off in one day, which was an amazing feat since it took me considerably longer to finish (and I'm usually a faster reader), and she's relatively picky about what she reads. (She gives this book high marks too.)<br />Now on to the plot. (Skip the next two paragraphs if you'd rather not know what this book is about. Don't worry; I've tried to keep all spoilers as to how it ends out.)<br />&quot;Neverwhere,&quot; which is Gaiman's first solo novel (he's co-written a few others, like &quot;Good Omens&quot; with Terry Pratchett, a novel that has considerable similarities to this one), is about Richard Mayhew, a Londoner who saves a wounded young woman (Door) who has somehow stumbled into London Above (the world we live in). She is from London Below, an underground world that has barely changed for hundreds of years.<br />After their meeting, Richard's identity is unexplainably lost--or rather, he becomes somewhat of a ghost. Therefore he must enter London Below and find a way to get his life back, by joining up with Door and her traveling companions--her bodyguard: the infamous Hunter, and the shady marquis de Carabas--who are in an avenging quest to find out who murdered Door's family. Along the way, Richard encounters a colony of subterranean rat-speakers, visits a &quot;moving&quot; market, boards a subway train containing a medieval court, and even has the pleasure of meeting a real live angel (&quot;Good Omens&quot; all over again).<br />&quot;Neverwhere&quot; is a delightfully witty and humorous dark fantasy, though not dark or somber enough to be considered a horror novel, in my opinion. What makes this book so hard to put down--besides the wit and humor--is its fastpace (even though it is 370 pages) and the strikingly well-developed characters, like the protagonist (Richard), who is my favorite in here, though the two assassins are a high second. This is definitely a must-read if you're into fantasies. Like Stephen King's &quot;It&quot;, this book will have you glancing down sewer drains while you're walking and wondering what's below your feet.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver<BR>By: Lois Lowry<BR>Reviewed by: E. Lee<BR>Period: 5<br /> In this book, Jonas, the main character, lives in a perfect world. Here, all the people are assigned jobs and there isn¡¯t any war or pain. As time goes by, Jonas becomes a Twelve and receives an assignment. As easy it may seem, Jonas becomes encouraged for it is a big change that is going to appear. Now as a Twelve, everyone is counting on him for he receives a special assignment. Jonas receives the assignment of being the next Receiver of Memory.<BR> The reason why I like this book, The Giver, is that it showed the same experience as what I went through. In this book, Jonas goes through a stage where he receives a job that he has to complete. ¡° Jonas was identified as a possible Receiver many years ago. We have observed him meticulously. There were no dreams of uncertainty.¡± This reminds me of all the things I had to do as I reached a certain age. Every time I read this book, it showed me that even though you receive a job, you should always try to accomplish it without a complaint. In other words, this book showed me of all the burdens that might pull you down, but you should always try to do your best to release the burden. For that, The Giver was a book I was fond by. <BR> Another reason The Giver was my favorite book is where this book took place. Here in the world where Jonas lives, the people can¡¯t feel pain. ¡° Jonas¡¯s world is perfect. Everything is under control. There is no war or fear or pain.¡± Also, the world is peaceful without a war to be insight. Comparing this world to the world we live in, there is a big difference. In our world, wars and pain are all felt by the citizens while in Jonas¡¯s world, they don¡¯t. It always seemed to come into my mind the fact that our world can¡¯t be in peace while Jonas¡¯s can. For this, I desire to live a world in peace and somewhere with out pain.<BR> My favorite part would have to be when Jonas¡¯s friend, Asher, called ¡°snacks¡± ¡°smacks¡¯ when he was in hi Threes. Long ago, Asher wanted a snack for he was hungry. When he went to the Chief Elder, he asked, ¡° Can I have some smacks?¡± After that, all the other Threes started laughing and told Asher that it was ¡°snacks¡± not ¡°smacks¡±. This was my favorite part because when Asher said ¡°smacks¡±, I thought he wanted a slap. This was my favorite part for it provided a sense of humor as the book continued.
B00006NSGX|5.0|Eric proves he is still 'God' on this live set, maybe he drinks from the decantor rather than than the can, but sometimes he gulps and downss straight from the barrel!<br />The sound quality and band are sublime ;-)<br />Rock on Eric!
B00006SFBD|5.0|Absolutely amazing! This being the first time that I've ever listened to Opeth, I was hesitant and a bit aprehensive. I've listened to metal my entire life, but I'll tell ya', I've never heard anything like this album. The shift from the most brutal guitar riffage to the cool smooth jazz is a trasition only made my masters of their art. Hats off to a band who transcends all description and breaks down the barriers that have confined so many before them.
B00008AY3L|4.0|The album itself is good, but I was very disappointed when I was unable transfer songs to my mp3 player.  The stupid disc is copy protected and since I carry around most of my music on my Rio, the cd is worthless to me.  They need to put a bigger warning label on these things.
B000089RVX|5.0|OH MY GOODNESS!.......<br />This album is ridiculously good!....First I saw the video for BRING ME TO LIFE...and I was instantly drawn....so..I went to CD SOURCE to listen and see what the rest would be like....This album is like fresh air.....there are so many dynamics mixed here but it doesn't sound cheesy at all...the only disappointment I found was that the guy that sings in BRING ME TO LIFE...doesn't sing as much as I would've prefered on other songs.  The female of the group has a BEAUTIFUL voice...(she reminds me of that bad ... chick that used to sing with HEART)...her voice is angelic but it has this edge to it...there is not even ONE ugly song on this album SERIOUSLY...and you know that is a rarity in this day and age...I just got this CD and it is in constant rotation in my CDchanger.  UMMMM just think about Linkin Park meets Tori Amos haunting voice...I cannot wait until the rest of the world knows just how hot this group is.  My favorite songs (I LOVE THEM ALL so this is kinda hard) are: HELLO...MY LAST BREATH...GOING UNDER....and of course BRING ME TO LIFE.....this is one of those things you buy and wondered what took so long...to hear some fresh stuff...everybody else seems to pale in comparison...if you are not digging this girl's voice and the fly ...music on this CD......YOU ARE MENTALLY UNSTABLE!!!!

B00005Q79B|3.0|Volume 37 of The Star Trek DVD series contains two of the lesser episodes from the show's third and final season.  This collection points out the low points of the third season because both episodes are quite weak.<br />THE LIGHTS OF ZETAR is the better of the two here.  However that's not saying much.  An evil alien entity invades the body of Lt. Mira Romaine (Jan Shutan) Scotty's new love interest.  The alien is from Zetar and threatens the crew that Mira will die.  Essentially this episode is a blue print for the famous horror film 'The Exorcist' however this episode lacks any distinct depth.  The episode isn't the worst in the series and Jan Shutan makes a nice acting appearance here.  However the story is weak, Scotty's love interest is completely unconvincing (like all the others he had), and the ending of this episode is completely lame.  I don't think evil possessive aliens can be defeated so easily by a pressure chamber!<br />It's gets worse though.  THE CLOUD MINDERS has to be one of the weakest Star Trek scripts ever to make it into production.  The episode try to tackles the discrimiantion issue between upper and lower class people, but ends up flopping over and the message is not only vague but incomplete.  The budget (which was really low at this point) was spent entirely on set and costume design.  Therefore we have a really weak script and some pretty mediocre and shoddy acting.  Although this episode may have been good had the budget been spent better and the plot developed more.  Even a double serving of eye candy with Diana Ewing (who plays Droxine, a rich Stratos girl who becomes a totally unbelieveable love interest for Spock) and Charlotte Polite, cannot save this episode from the depths of humilation.  It's bad but there has been worse so this is still watchable.   <br />Overall not the best thing to come out of the Star Trek production crew but this is still classic Trek and worth picking up.  Recommended to fans of the Original series.
B00005JLFC|5.0|I fell in love with this movie within the first few minutes, and you can't say that very often! It is a lovely period piece, showing the lifestyle of a Jewish woman around the turn of the century, longing for something more than just the average life.  Her desire for learning and understanding her faith and experiencing freedom of knowledge is a subject that keeps this film classic for all time.  Not only is this Streisand's directing debut (amazing!) it is also the best performance I have ever seen her in, and her best music.  Papa, Can you Hear me, and Piece of Sky, will remain in your heart forever.  Expect to be humming it for the rest of your life!  What a voice!  This film should have been out on DVD by now.  That is why I visited this site...to buy it!  Come on..let's get it on DVD so the veiwing may begin!  Enjoy!
B000002IGV|5.0|Twisted sister ROCKS in this great addition to metal. All of the tracks are good I espically like BURN IN HELL and I WANNA Rock. WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE is also good. All in all every track is great.
B000089RVX|2.0|I hate to be the guy that likes only the Big Radio Hit, but that seems to be the case here. Yeah, \\"Bring Me to Life\\" is a good tune -- textured, swelling, and rocking when it gets going. And, yeah, she's got a great voice. But the rest of the disc is sort of faux-gothy, lyrically lame, and plodding in that cliched, Linkin Park way. It may appeal to those under 20, but older, discriminating listeners won't find much here.
B00005JLSC|3.0|My friend and I wanted to see the movie before the Academy Awards were on.  I just want to start out by saying I do enjoy musicals and all types of movies.  While I was watching Chicago at the theatre I wished I had waited for the rental as I did for Moulin Rouge.  I fully enjoyed the second half of Moulin Rouge so I was glad I stuck with it to see what the hoopla was about, however I'm also glad I waited for the rental.  The movie Chicago has great musical numbers, humor, drama, but there was something missing.  It's odd because my friend felt the exact same way.  We both looked at eachother and said \\"rental\\".  I think the reviewers who really enjoyed it were happy to see something from Broadway make it to the big screen and that it was done well.  I thought the performances were very good but the size disparity between Rene and Catherine throws off some of the scenes especially when they are dancing together.  Anyway, not everyone can go to Broadway so this means of reaching people is great.  But, if you like \\"Movies\\" this may not be the one for you.  Get it?

0800141849|5.0|I really enjoyed this film and felt it was DEFINITELY not your regular cliched story of an ugly duckling transformation to pretty girl variety, nor should it be relegated to that category. It had several more layers to it than that, and people accustomed to watching a heartfelt, quality film would recognize that. In fact, I think the editorial viewer for this site who called it &quot;self-absorbed&quot; on Streisand's part, must have been watching another movie when he stated:<br />&quot;Her character constantly gazes upon her own reflection and is told at least a dozen times, one way or another, just how attractive she is. One wants to shout out, we get it already--you're pretty!&quot;<br />What was he talking about? The entire film had her mother and sister nagging her about her sloppy and ugly appearance and constantly telling her how unattractive she was! And the reason she was constantly gazing at the mirror at her face was because she was critiquing it! She was critical of her own appearance, because she didn't feel attractive. She was by no means gazing at her reflection out of vanity! That much was definitely clear to anybody who actually paid attention to the film. And by the way, in case anybody has skipped the title, it's called &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;, which explains the metaphor of her constantly looking in the mirror, and mirrors constantly being shown throughout the film even when she's not gazing into them, to demonsrate the symoblism of the film's title. The mirrors were certainly not there to demonstrate how beautiful Barbra Streisand was! On the contrary, it was pointing out that she was NOT the conventional beautiful woman (in contrast to Elle Macpherson's character).<br />Perhaps people's personal opinions about the actress interfere with their opinion on the film, which I really found to be exceptional. The issues the film addressed-  a culture absorbed with perfection and external beauty-was very well incorporated into the film. Ithought it was one of the more intelligent films I have seen in some time.
B000000H4A|5.0|This album reigns supreme in King Diamond's solo career in my eyes. Songs like the Jonah or the Candle can be catchy and spooky at the same time. It exudes an atmosphere inherent on other albums, but still sounds freshest at this point up to \\"Conspiracy\\". King Diamond has an uncanny sense of melody here, and it shows in his awesome singing. SOme of the stuff is unintentionally funny, but overall the horror schlock entertains in many ways. Highly recommended horror metal from the INSANE master of the macabre, King Diamond.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|After hearing their single on the radio I wanted to get this cd but was worried that the single was the only good song on the album.  Boy was I wrong!  This is the best cd I have t.A.T.u has such a different and awsome kind of voice to them weither they are singing in russian or english it is great!  The best way to describe their music is a type of techno dance, that will stick in your head and you will want it to be their!  Just a great cd!
0385504209|5.0|I have never read a work of fiction based on so many fascinating truths.  The Da Vinci Code is absolutely the best thriller I've read in years.  I can't wait for the next installment!
0385484518|4.0|I was so touched by this book.  Many parts just brought me to tears.  Even in his [last] days Morrie still continues to teach some very important lessons to Mitch, who is a bit lost and unsure of his decisions in life.  I think that this book puts out such a powerful message.  A message that you only have one chance in life so why not make it the best time you have ever had by doing the things that are important instead of putting things off and surrounding your life with the things that really don't matter in the long run. <BR>All in all I thought this book was great for anyone who wants to read a book with some great meaning and messages.  It's a great book for anyone who feels a little lost or overwhemled in this busy and complicated world we live in, to put life back in perspective and give you a new outlook on many things.  It's also just a great story of two people who found eachother again after many years and who reconnected and spent some great Tuesdays together.  <BR>I really enjoyed reading \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\".
B00006F7S4|1.0|&quot;Paper Tiger&quot;.  I've burned a hole in this CD playing this song over and over again.  I gave the rest of the album a good, hard listen hoping to find other orchestral pieces that sear your body and mind as much as this one, but came up sadly empty-handed. Download this tune, but save your money and don't purchase the CD, unless you crave moderate despondency.
0465011020|4.0|I agree with the reviewer who said this book is somewhat poorly written (because of the translation from Korean to French to English), but in a sense that is the strength of the book.  It gives it a raw, authentic feel.   In a macabre way it is also humorous.  Finally the short chapters make for good bedtime reading.  Very nicely done book.  It wets a perverse appetite to visit and see some of this for yourself.
B0000028RR|5.0|From the band Inside Out, Zack De la Rocha and co. reveal to the world rap/metal at its best.Releasing an album during the grunge scene when bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden,Alice in Chain and Nirvana polluted airwaves,Rage released &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; in 1992.the record starts off with &quot;Bombtrack&quot;,a great song with a verse like &quot; now dope hooks make punks  take another look&quot; to the 6-minute track &quot;Freedom&quot;,which closes the album.This album introduced the world to guitarist Tom Morello, who not only strums his guitars, but scratches, squawks and screeches from the instruments making music the world has never heard.This album shows how well Rage's timing is as in the song &quot;Fistful of Steel&quot; where the drums and bass lines grab the listeners attention.With politically motivated lyrics,rememorable drum patterns, great riffs and thundering bass , Rage Against the Machine show the world they mean business.One of my personal favorite albums.You can't you wrong with this classic debut.
B00008977N|1.0|All I can say: great audio, audio engineer should be proud of highly professional job. On the other hand, video is absolutely unacceptable and video tech should be ashamed for ruining what could be one of the benchmark concert DVDs. Five stars for audio, minus five stars for video!
B00005JLK1|4.0|I decided to ignore most reviews of this film and check it out anyway. I am very glad I did. I don't understand why people think its so bad. Ghost Ship is about a crew who aboard an abandoned ship that went missing in 1962, and was never heard of again. The crew finds it and strange things begin to happen. They start seeing Ghosts, hence the title. The ghosts are the passengers who were brutally killed on the ship, obviously.<BR>The film has a few scary moments and it moves along quickly. There is a major plot twist at the end that I did not see coming at all and I thought it was brilliant. You can't comment on the acting of a horror movie, it's pointless, but luckily Ghost Ship has a cast of well known, and talented actors such as Gabriel Byrne, Julianne Marguiles, and Ron Eldard. If not for them, the film could have been a lot more cheesy, but I thought the film was intriguing, scary, and creepy. The opening scene by far one of the most gruesome scenes in film is worth seeing this film for.
B00000880Y|4.0|Just thought I'd mention that the Bert of \\"Bert's Blues\\" is Bert Jansch, who was a big influence on just about all British guitarists of the period.    Donovan's gentle 60s lyricism may be out of fashion in this age of plastic disposable pop and gangsta rap, but all his early albums are still worth listening to if you like real music.    PS There is now (2005) a new remastered and expanded version of this album available.  Get that instead.
B00008DDXC|5.0|We must be nuts about Harry Potter. My wife and I have seen the movie about 20 times in the theater and have lost count of how many times we watched this DVD at home (and even camping). Like many DVDs this one contains lots of extras. You will need a fast internet connection and a microphone on your PC to try everything. I just wish they had a option to put the deleted scenes back into the movie.
0393974650|2.0|The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde <BR>By: Robert Louis Stevenson<BR>Reviewed by: E. ...<BR>Period:6<br />This book is about a man that has somehow brought out an evil side of him. He is a scientist and he makes a concoction that has brought out the evil part. At first the man is able to be somewhat aware of what the other person does, but it gets worse and he looses control. He has few conscious moments and often wakes up not knowing what has happened. His friend learns about the evil side, but has no idea that both of the men are the same. As the friend learns more, he becomes closer and closer to the horrible truth. Then the evil side kills a man and he hides by becoming the good man and hiding in his house. The friend thinks the evil man has killed the good one, but he soon finds out something is very strange about the whole situation. Then the friend receives a letter from the man and he gets the supplies asked in the letter. A man meets the friend and makes a concoction. Then he drinks it and all of a sudden the man turns into his friend that seems to have been revived from the evil side. The whole story is a mystery as the friend finds more clues. <br />The thing I liked was how the story was set up and how the whole thing was a mystery so that it kept you interested in finding out the answer. It got confusing at times and I had to re-read parts to find out the clues and truly understand it. \\"pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death-there stood Henry Jekyll! \\" The good man had only a little power left and he needed the concoction to make himself regular again. The person that his friend saw was a mixture of evil and good with the good barely holding out. After that, the friend was told everything and he listened in shock. This part didn't come until near the end so that it was a twist in the story that is unexpected. <br />The book may have been good for its story line, but parts of thestory got to be repetitive and it got to the point where it was boring and it was hard to keep going. The end really disappointed me, because the story was pretty decent and then the end came and it was bad. The end was supposed to be a letter written from the last words of the good man that was losing his power to stay in control. The letter was at least twenty pages and was filled with confusing sentences and the same information being repeated over and over. It got tiring and boring very quickly, so that I struggled to keep reading. I finally made it through and the end of the letter said that the good man was saying he was going to end his miserable life. \\"Here, then, as I lay down the pen, and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end. That ending would have been good if it wasn't after the most boring part in the book. <br />My favorite part of the book was when the friend and the butler of the good man break into the study to get the materials wanted by the man. It was my favorite part because lots of clues start to come out and it's the point right before finding out the truth of the evil and good man. My least favorite part is the end when the same information is repeated and the words are so confusing that it is very boring. Overall the book has a good way of keeping the reader suspenseful, but it also does the opposite with the repeated parts and the story may seem a little over stretched.
B00005JLSC|4.0|Rob Marshall's jazzy adaption of Bob Fosse's 1975 Broadway musical CHICAGO is a successful attempt at combining court-room drama and classy musical numbers. And while it may not win big at the Oscars (My bet is on GANGS OF NEW YORK), it still displays enough kinetic, energising spirit to make it a worthy contender for the awards. Marshall's knowing direction makes the whole film enjoyable and the musical numbers are as kitchy as they are catchy. Richard Gere's performance as greasy, smooth-talking laywer Billy Flynn is a nice departure from his usual New York city man shtick. The leading pair of Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones have never been better. An exhilarating film that keeps up its flashy sense of fun until the closing credits, CHICAGO does razzle and indeed, dazzle.
B00007KQA3|3.0|1984 was my sophomore year in high school, so I read the book, and made a point of seeing the film when it was originally released in theaters.<br />The film itself is very well done and it doesn't necessarily bother me that the Eurythmics score is missing, although Julia's theme was a haunting classic as I remember it.  It was also interesting to look at Allan Cameron's production design years before he moved on to such features as Starship Troopers and Tomorrow Never Dies.  My real complaint is the lack of supplemental features.<br />I remember a slew of television documentaries and news reports from the year 1984 that explored the anniversary of the novel and used it as a touchstone to examine whether or not our society, government, and technologies were leading us down a similar path.  I'm sure a few of these or an original feature could have been added to the disc offering a snapshot of how things are in the 21st century compared to Orwell's vision.  There wasn't even a booklet inside the DVD package.  It also would have been nice if there had been a commentary.  If Foxy Brown can contain a commentary from director Jack Hill, then Mr. Radford could have spent an afternoon making one for this disc!<br />An interesting comparison disc to view with 1984 might be Minority Report.  That movie does offer a very forseeable future where technology has enabled not just the government, but advertisers to invade practially every aspect of our life.
B00003CXXM|4.0|In the vein of &quot;keep-you-guessing&quot; movies like the excellent MEMENTO, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is an exciting movie with enough fast-paced action to sustain audiences during the action movie madness that is Hollywood. The film rests largely on Matt Damon's shoulders and thankfully he has enough acting chops to make you believe the character. The compelling story lends itself well to a film, which, while not completly an out-and-out action thriller, contains some fantastically contrived set-pieces, like the exciting car chase and the final showdown where Bourne finds the answers to the thorny problem of who he actually is. One of the few brainy action films of late, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is one exciting ride.
B00008977N|2.0|I was really excited to get this DVD, only to face dissapointment. I actually bought this at a store, and I had to exchange it three times because each DVD skipped in between \\"Digging in the Dirt\\" and \\"Sledgehammer.\\" I still haven't found a disk that doesn't do that, which makes me think that this DVD is destined to be re-called.<BR>The quality of the film looks cheap (but that's already been mentioned by other reviewers). I was dissapointed that there were limited extras--multiple camera angles would have been wonderful, considering that there is a lot of action going on the two stages and the camera offers a limited view. Also, this may sound a bit picky, but I wish the menu had larger print. It took me a while to realize what I was choosing... Overall, only Peter Gabriel fans will appreciate this DVD...
B00005N5VO|5.0|Typical Don Ellis genius.  Worth watching it for the music.
B0000640VO|5.0|I'd heard a number of good things about this film before I finally picked it up, but I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. I instantly fell in love with this amazing little gem of a film. <br />Amelie is an introspective, thoughtful young woman who is inspired one day to help improve the lives of those around her. Before you start to think this is some schlocky, maudlin film about doing good deeds let me set the record straight. The things that Amelie does to improve her friends' lives are far from normal. Whether she's sending her father's garden gnome on a trip across the world or hypothesizing about a man in a strange set of photographs Amelie's mind is always delightfully at work. She lives in a dream world and an enchanting world it is. <br />In addition to the vivid and original storyline the film also has a signature visual style. This was my first time viewing a film by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, but it will certainly not be my last. The colors jump wildly off the screen and the cinematography is breathtaking. I can't wait to watch the film without the subtitles and simply take in the visual artistry of it.<br />\\"Amelie\\" is such an inspiring film and one that will stick with you for a long time. It definitely deserves to be watched over and over again.
0792839749|5.0|My kid watches this movie at least 2 times a day, and has been doing that for the past 3 months. Great thing about this movie is that even we do not get bored and watch it every time whole heartedly along with our kid. I can only imagine how my kid must be feeling about the flying car, nifty gadgets and of course the child catcher. My kid just runs around the room jumping whenever the child catcher comes. A Truly Scrumptious movie!
B00006BSGZ|5.0|I first heard about this performance (Tosca) nearly 30 years ago when I was a teenager and new to the world of opera. Since then it had stuck in the back of my mind, occasionally being brought intensely to the forefront whenever a snippet of it was shown during the occasional documentary.<br />Here it is, after three decades, it's going on 2 a.m., and I've had one of the most profound experiences in recorded opera.....whew!<br />First of all, this is a barebones dvd: Chapter list and some brief but interesting notes in the accompanying liner.<br />Then there are the performances...Callas in concert at Covent Garden in 1962. &quot;Tu che la vanità&quot; from Don Carlos, plus the Habanera and Seguedille from Act 1 of Carmen. Callas sings with the expected intensity in the Verdi, and with atypical jovolity and coyness in the Bizet, which are all ably conducted by the young Georges Prêtre. If this were the entire content of this dvd, it would be worth the cost.<br />But along comes Act 2 of Tosca, from two years later. Holy Toledo! Renato Cioni sings Cavaradossi just adaquetely, and not really serving a whole lot of dramatic purpose with a standard performance. Robert Bowman as Spoletta and Dennis Wicks as Sciaronne are better in their acting, but not very impressive vocally. The conductor, Cillario, leads without much insight...again, standard opera fare.<br />Obviously, the big bucks went to Callas, Gobbi, and Zeffirelli who all certainly earned their pay. Callas and Gobbi had seen better days vocally, especially Callas who, though in pretty good voice, sounds downright nasty here and there. But those very few exceptions are far and few in between.<br />Here are two masters, two artists at the very top of their craft, two legendary performers giving a definitive performance of sight and sound. From the beginning of the act, Gobbi dominates with a presence that few could ever hope to do. And when Callas finally enters, the sparks fly. Nearly every gesture, every vocal inflection, every subtle nuance carries weight that cannot be measured. There are very very few moments of stage mannerisms, so complete are their portrayals. While not always pretty vocally, they show off to the world why they dominated the opera stage during their prime. The intensity they create together is incredible, seldom letting up in the cat and mouse game they play.<br />Technically, the picture is good, but not great.Pretty good by early 60's television standards. The camera work for the most part is well done, save for a few instances of poor angles or exclusionary closeups that can be pretty frustrating.Overall, it is quite good.<br />Zeffirelli, the ultra conservative, directs a wonderful production,but when you go back in time, you see how little he really changes over the years.<br />For all it's relatively minor shortcomings, this is one of the greatest operatic moments on film. The earlier clips are priceless, but after a (literally) hair raising Tosca, you may barely remember them! 5 stars to the 10th power! Thank you EMI!
B00008AY3L|5.0|Ben Harper takes some getting used to if you're uninitiated, but with a little effort and an open mind you'll find one of the most talented and rewarding artists working today. In terms of his construction of retro sounds, Ben Harper has a very Lenny Kravitz-like approach but is far deeper and more intelligent. Harper starts with a hippie soul and blues foundation, and he's surely got a retro vibe, but he's quite adept at many kinds of music. The album starts with a fresh reggae workout in \\"With My Own Two Hands\\" which is basically a copy of Bob Marley's \\"Burnin' and Lootin'\\" but is more tribute than plagiarism. The album proceeds enjoyably through the dramatic grungy power ballad \\"Touch From Your Lust,\\" country blues in \\"When It's Good,\\" and slamming heavy rock in \\"Temporary Remedy\\" and \\"So High So Low.\\" There's even a touch of gospel in \\"Blessed to Be a Witness\\" and moving African vocals (featuring Ladysmith Black Mambazo) in \\"Picture of Jesus.\\" Plus you can't forget the aptly titled \\"Bring the Funk.\\" But with all these different genres and styles that shouldn't even be near each other, the most amazing thing about this album is that it actually succeeds as an all-around work of art. That is Ben Harper's greatest strength.
B0000029DD|5.0|This album is exquisite. It is rare these days (although sadly his days are over) do you find such a voice as Buckley's. His voice is beautiful and evocative to such a degree that there isn't a moment when his voice isn't steeped in emotion. What Buckley makes you feel is that life can occur in moments that are emotional and sentimental and it isn't corny! Songs like So Real, which has an unforgettable guitar rhythm, hi-lite his amazing voice and show him as a more than capable music writer. <br />He crafts his songs quite well as they move toward a climax and let you down slowly as it reaches it denouement. But, he isn't all about a pretty voice and emotion filled lyrics, he shows on songs like Last Goodbye and Dream Brother that he can tackle the harder and faster tempo music, as well. I am a huge fan of Cohen, and it is rare I like someone elses version of his songs, but Hallelujah does it for me. Unfortunately this is all we got from Buckley except for his posthumous Sketches which is equally as good as Grace and depending on my mood better. Good, Good, Good!
B00008DDHZ|5.0|Rough, dark, and foreboding, \\"Bloody Sunday\\" is anything but standard movie fare. This movie deftly explores the massacre of January 30, 1972 using a documentary format, edited in a manner to make you feel like the events are unfolding in real-time. The documentary style lends the movie an authenticity which you rarely find in mainstream movies. This makes the effects of massacre feel incredibly visceral. The movie is hard to watch for this reason. It's downright grim at times and drags the viewer along through some of the aftermath - the grieving and anger that the event caused.<br />The scariest thing about this movie, however, is the fact that it is tough to draw the line at fact and fiction. I don't know what really happened on Bloody Sunday since this was really first exposure to it, but the movie demonizes very effectively the occupying forces. Movies like this are dangerous and exhilerating precisely because they have the ability to conflate the reality of the event with the drama of the film, but they also have the ability to be reckless in their representation of events. If things actually occurred the way that the movie depicts them, then the members of the occupying force should be ashamed of themselves. If the events of the movie inappropriately condemn that force for taking actions that they did not make, then the director should be ashamed. Watch at your own risk.
0790736241|1.0|Did Carl Sagan write this horrible movie ?! I expected something profound and spiritual... this is \\"junk\\". On a more positive note, the sense of wonder evoked by the introductory scene does persist in the rest of the movie. Too bad it is supported by \\"junk\\".<br />Some positive (+) and negative (-) points :<br />- The \\"we all need beliefs\\" argument rears its ugly head more than once. This is apparently the morale of the story.<BR>- Also according to this movie, prosperity and technology makes people less happy and connected (guess in the Middle Ages everyone was everyone's best buddy - crime ? wars ? what's that ?).<BR>- In this warped alternate universe, SETI is actually useful and approved by private individuals, instead of being a big government boondoggle for scientists.<BR>+ Shows that faith can only validate itself in violence.<BR>-+ \\"Useful science\\" and paranormal beliefs are both portrayed as negative.
B0000029DD|5.0|My first exposure to Jeff Buckley was from his song &quot;Last Goodbye&quot;.  I loved that song so much and it stayed in my subconsious for years until I finally purchased the album &quot;Grace&quot;.  For some reason, I knew I would love it, I didn't need to hear all of the songs first.  This album always takes me on a trip when I hear it.  I remember playing the song &quot;Lilac Wine&quot; in my car late one night, there was no one on the street and no other cars on the road.  The air seemed so still and the night so dark. And I just drove down the road alone and listened to this haunting song, conjuring up images of old, romantic love and how life and people and their hearts and desires have changed.  It was definately a moment I will remember.  I also had an experience with the song &quot;Halleluiah&quot;.  Don't ever listen to this song when your depressed, that's all I will say.  Lyrically, this is such a rich album, the words get into your soul and paint pictures for your imagination.  &quot;So Real&quot; is another of my favourite tracks.  Jeff Buckley's voice soars on this one.  Not knowing much about Jeff Buckley, I do know he was a talented, unique musician and his music lives on.
B000002NAK|5.0|There are two types of reviewers for this album: those that have seen the stage show and those that have only seen the movie.  I belong to the latter, thus I can only judge it from that standpoint.<br />Therefore, I can only say that The Material Girl does an extremely good job in bringing the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber to the screen.  It is obviously that that singer worked hard; she shows a maturity that is far removed from her early &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; days.<br />A healthy release at two discs, &quot;Evita&quot; will have one &quot;crying for Argentina&quot; and wishing that Madonna could find another vehicle such as this one.
B000002H72|5.0|This album is a testament to the diverse talents and the genius in the band called the Pixies. A more refined and poppish album than Surfer Rosa, Doolittle offers the other side of the alternative rock scene. Doolittle at first is quite similar too Rosa with offering like Debaser and Tame, but the ethereal crazed Beach Boy tune Wave of Mutilation introduces us to a new side of the Band. Once can start to see the dominance of Black Francis in songs like this and Here Comes Your man which are much more mainistream than anything on either of their previous albums. In fact Deal has no songs on the album, which for me isn't disappointing as Into the White and Gigantic (some previous Deal tunes) lacked the drive and dynamics that define the Pixies. <br />Even La La Love You, which seems like a throwback to early 80's English music, is twisted as a soft voice mocks Lovering's lead vocals. The band even delves into alt./country with Silver. In toto this album is quite different than Surfer Rosa, but that's what makes it good. The choppy guitar work of Santiago on I Bleed, and the raunchy vocals of #13 remind us that it is still the great hard band that is evolving. Sure the Pixies ifluenced Nirvana and every other alt band that followed them, the difference is that no band, including Nirvana, could make an album like this. This is a must have...Geniussssssssss!
B00005M989|4.0|There seems to be some controversy regarding this one CD compilation.  Some die hard Prince fans are offended that the record label released this one CD greatest hits when there were already two and three CD sets previously released on the market.  Whereas I can understand these perspectives, I am choosing to evaluate the music on this compilation.<br />In spite of this CD not being all that comprehensive, I enjoy many of the songs on it.  Little Red Corvette and 1999 are super classics as are the songs from Purple Rain. Well, I am not too crazy about I Would Die For U but the other tunes rule. Kiss is a funky soul number and Sign O The Times is kind of cool.  Surprise gems are Cream and the hip hop Get Off.  Alphabet Street and Thieves In The Temple are a bit to helter skelter for me.<br />Anyway, this compilation is for those who want a quick fix on Prince and aren't too interested in exploring him much further.  Maybe that was the reason for this release in addition to the record company trying to bilk some more cash.  Nonetheless, those fans seeking to explore this very creative artist should probably sample his originally released material or at least explore the other more comprehensive compilation sets out on the market.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I love to read entertainment banter or political opinion, for that matter, that is polarized. It reinforces my opinion that there are basically two types of human beings on this earth, and I don't mean male and female. Road rage isn't a new phenomenon, you understand.    That said, Mulholland Drive is easily one of the most thought-provoking films produced in the last quarter century. In fact, it doesn't even matter if MD doesn't click as a movie, as so many have written. Step back and take another look. Lynch's little opus puts in front of the eyes (and ears) a demonstration of the mechanics of human emotion as effectively as anything committed to celluloid (or digicam)in recent memory. You think me daft? It's right up there with The Godfather. You ask how can I compare such drivel with a masterpiece? Go figure. It's sleight-of-hand cinema that delves deep into the inner workings of the mind. Do you suppose Dostoyevsky knew at all times where the story was leading him? I doubt it.
B00005QFHG|4.0|I really enjoye dthsi movie.  I found it to be both humorous and romantic.  I was really lucky to have chosen an off night to go to the theater so I sat in a vintage theater, all by myself and watched the show.  Perhaps the setting added to the mystique and romance of the movie and allowed me to focus deeply into it.  Juliette Bincohe is excellent as a woman who is used to moving because of the wild effects her work and has to finally confront that she's become so habitual in her wanderlust that it's her and not her mysterious effects that making her move around so.  Judi Dench is also great as an old woman who has to learn to change her ways.  While everyone is affected by the chocolate, it's interesting to see how the opposing sides judge freedom.  This film has a subversive message about pleasure and it's relationship to God.  So many times God is portrayed in Western culture as authoritative, somber and frankly, mean.  When in fact, the Divine is anything but those things, this film ultimately reflects that concept.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I could not believe how wonderful this movie was.  I actually saw the broadway musical with Lilith from Cheers.  I thought that was great and I wondered how could Gere, Zeta-Jones, etc.  pull this off.  You will NOT be dissapointed.  The music is so powerful and exciting.  I will be buying this on DVD when it is released and I don't buy a lot of movies.  If you don't want to know what the movie is about please skip a lot of the reviews because they give away way too much.  Just rest assured you will be entertained.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is just a great set of DVD's, I find myself watching them over and over. This is one of those cases where when you watch the episodes again and again, you learn more and more. Everything comes together as you understand the characters and the events occuring around them. This is just a great set of DVD's, I really feel I got my money's worth here, I recommend this to everyone remotely interested in WW2.
B000088E6D|4.0|Michael Buble exhibits extroardinary talent and is to be applauded for reviving the beautiful romantic songs of the great crooners such as Sinatra and Martin. His voice can sound as soft as rose petals one moment and as strong as a hurricane the next. This CD is a breath of fresh air and I can only see his talent broadening as he matures. The song &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; with Barry Gibb singing backup vocals actually made me cry, it was so poignant. You won't be disappointed. This is a great CD.
B00007AJGH|5.0|As soon as you open the &quot;briefcase&quot; of the new Vista Series Roger Rabbit, you can tell it is going to be a first class adventure. Everything about this set is all about fun. Hours and hours of fun, from the multitude of extras on both discs, down to all the menus and insulting cab comments. I haven't seen the previous DVD version of this, so I can't compare the two. I can say however, that this is a much better and more enjoyable presentation than the special edition CAV Laserdisc (even as nice as that was). The picture looks great, the 5.1 mix is great, you have more choices of how to spend your time with this set than a barrel full of weasels. You really couldn't ask for much more. I wish all DVD releases had this much thought and effort put into them.<br />I won't go into a review of the film, there are plenty of those already. I've loved it since it first jumped from the cinema screens. I still love it today. Even as good as computer art has become, there is a special magic sometimes from brush and ink that can't be replaced. Adding in the incredible live action interactions makes Roger hard to top. This film will live on long after the next &quot;new and improved&quot; way comes along to put toons to film.<br />This Roger is a winner all the way around, spread the word...ppllppllpplleeeeeaaaaaasssse!
B00005O5JV|3.0|This played out like a big fantasy.  And sometimes there's nothign wrong with that and other times it seems like there is.  Maybe it was the squealing men and women over this film, the envy of wanting to be blonde and all that stereotype connotes that added to my feelings of this film.  I understand the whole blonde \\"thing\\" and there were points where this movie is funny.  Do I think it's sequel worthy?  No, not really.  This one film spent so much time catering to Reese Witherspoon------who doesn't exactly thrill me  as an actress here, thoguh she did in Election----that it was hard to get out of the bubblegum feeling about this whole thing.  Sometimes bubblegum is too sticky
B00000I01A|5.0|So many great songs on this one, all it's missing is the origianl theme.  But well worth the purchase for eye of the tiger and burning heart.  Go Rocky!
B00008AY3L|1.0|First of all, this review will not address the actual MUSIC on this disc, which is up to Harper's usual platinum standard of songwriting and musicianship.<br />No, this is intended to be a warning that this CD has been laced with copy-protect technology that prevents those who paid for it from making MP3s and whatnot. It also prevents you from even listening to the disc on a computer except by using an extremely low-quality proprietary player that limits the quality to just 48 kbps -- about what you'd get from AM radio.<br />I own hundreds of CDs, and while my buying has slowed in recent years as family commitments and other interests take precedence, I still buy one or two discs a month. This is the first I have run across that does this. I am stunned. I bought a portable MP3 player about two years ago, and use it for all my on-the-go listening. With a baby in the house I can't even listen to much music on the home stereo. Ben Harper is perhaps my favorite modern artist, and I am furious that EMI/Virgin have carried out this underhanded assault on consumer fair use rights.<br />A page on the Web site of Virgin Records America confirmed the CD has been booby-trapped. A feedback form on their site did not work. I hope others are as outraged as I am and put some effort into tracking down how to voice displeasure.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I will keep it short and simple. Hands down this is thee BEST cd released by any artist in the year 2002. It is now almost April 2003 and I still love this CD. This is Wilco's BEST ever.
B000066C8G|3.0|Thsi movie skewered the whole mystique of super models, of their self-involvement and their lives while throwing in a political assasination plot.  The trailers build this as a model becoming a spy but in fact he's brainwashed so that part doesn't play well because that plotline isn't developed.  Teh only redeeming thing I can say about this film is that it was really funny in it's self-mockery and Stiller got his parents jobs as well as collected 20 million for this.

0553213105|5.0|Is she proud and he prejudice? Maybe it is he who is proud and she who is prejudice? Despite the arguments that could be made both ways, Jane Austen does indeed do an excellent job in bringing together two people of such different moral standing and ensnare them in a delightful and romantic story.<br />  The heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a witty, presumptuous young lady with an uncontrollable urge to speak her mind. Her antagonist is the very wealthy and very blatant Mr. Darcy, who has his own ideas about how certain people should act and behave. So how can two people so wrong for each other and so different ever be brought together?<br />  Elizabeth finds herself alone with Mr. Darcy on many awkward occasions and always manages to say something to hurt his precious ego. I think it is absolutely amazing how he can fall in love with a woman who has nothing but utter disdain for him and everything he stands for. She is, however, an amazing woman.<br />  Elizabeth is caring and considerate and very much eager to be in love, although she sometimes hides it well. She has the utmost affection for her family, and especially for her older sister, whose heart she would gladly do anything to keep from breaking.<br />  In Mr. Darcys defense, he is a very well rounded gentleman. He has the highest and most prestigious upbringing. However, he lets his social status and wealth dictate his heart and cause him to spiral into a soul searching debate over love verses social standing.<br />  The entire story leaves the reader captivated and in agony, ready to flip to the end to see if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth truly find love.
B00008977N|2.0|I must agree with other reviewers' criticisms of the video quality of this DVD.  It doesn't look good.  Not only is it grainy with a number of obviously visible MPEG macroblocking artifacts, but the widescreen presentation is simply ill advised.  <br />Compare it to the Laserdisc.  Unlike many DVDs which take what was originally a widescreen presentation &quot;panned and scanned&quot; for videotape and return it to its original form, this DVD takes the 4:3 original material and zooms in on it, chopping off the top and bottom.  In general, this isn't too badly done, but I must ask what is the point?  Why not show all that was recorded?  I suspect that the zoom also magnified the film grain.<br />This is widescreen for the sake of a marketing bullet, not for the sake of a quality presentation.<br />Also, although others may disagree, I think that the color is under-saturated.  Maybe it's just because I'm used to the Laserdisc, but the rich colors in that format were very pleasing, and the DVD's presentation, while possibly more accurate, is less pleasing somehow.<br />What's even more disappointing than the video, though, is the audio remix.  This is, after all, a musical event.  I have the Laserdisc of the concert, and I also have the 2-disc CD album.  They are slightly different mixes, but pretty similar.  <br />This DVD is a completely new mix, and one that I don't particularly like.  Why?  Although there are some areas where the mix is clearly nicer and the instruments are better defined, there are others where parts of the audio that I found really enjoyable on the LD and CD are missing.  <br />For example, Tony Levin's Moog bass line on &quot;Shaking the Tree&quot; and his synth bass line on &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot; both lack the sub-bass rumble and punch of the CD and LD presentations.  It's as if, in trying to make the bass sounds &quot;tight&quot; and &quot;dynamic&quot;, the mixer totally rolled off anything under about 40Hz.  Also, the snarl of Levin's Chapman Stick glissando is missing when the band enters on Solsbury Hill, which in my view simply ruins the dramatic moment of the tune.<br />The disc has some nice extras, and for this reason I gave it more than 1 star.  But, it's really quite disappointing, and it will not replace my Laserdisc.
B00005U18E|2.0|What I found most disgusting about this film was that the whole point was that Bridget was finding herself as separate from needing a man.  From being the tragic girl desperately running after a man.  And then she ran barefooted in the rain after Colin Firth.  Almost as if she couldn't simply tell him the truth, see him for what he was and love that and had to debase herself as she had worked so hard to erase from her habits.  Thats when the film really was a let down for me.

B000002UB3|5.0|For me this is Harrison's shining moment.<br />This is where the man finally got respect. Even though The Beatles have been seen as pop merchants with no depth, I have to disagree. There was one writer in the Beatles who showed great depth in lyric, tone and songwriting, as early as 1966. Harrison had long stepped out of the shadows of Lennon &amp; McCartney by the time Abbey Road was released in 1969, he just confused the pop audience with his anti-tax statements, his Indian influenced songs, his explorations on class, and the overall depth of his lyrics. He began being profound with 'Within You Without You' , and his understanding of the world and its workings were far more clearer than Lennon's, or what Lennon could bother to write about.<br />Lennon &amp; McCartney's greatest aim they felt, despite their success, was to have Frank Sinatra record one of their songs. What does this mean? Its not about being a fan of Frank's. Its about crossing generational gaps, to get respect from a previous generations icon(s), and that songs go beyond age and status quo. THAT's what that means. And the only song Sinatra every covered by The Beatles in their time was Harrison's 'Something'. Beautiful. No matter that the guy credited it to Lennon &amp; McCartney, and that mistake is often made by many who don't know the difference or the Beatles catalogue by heart. But he called it the greatest love song of the past 50 years. Now, you may say who cares what Sinatra thinks???? And then ask Lennon &amp; McCartney the same question.<br />And that the general character of Harrison stood in great contrast to the personalities of Lennon &amp; McCartney says a lot about what makes this album great for him. When he stood out from the shadow of Lennon &amp; McCartney as composers was back in 1966, when it looked like he could make SUCCESS of it was in 1969, and thats the only shadow he stepped out from under by those two, and the work of George Martin. NO matter what you think of the song, Gold &amp; Platinum speak volumes, and whether you're an artist who's singing about marigolds or about depravation, money talks. Its the way of the world, but should never ascertain the criteria in which music is judged. Unfortunately, Lennon, McCartney &amp; George Martin all judged Harrison's, and Starkey's contributions to The Beatles in this way.<br />Harrison's support of Starkey continued after The Beatles split up. Lennon &amp; McCartney openly laughed at Ringo's attempts to write songs, as well as ridicule more often than not Harrison's.<br />Harrison's help on Octopus's Garden did Ringo a world of good. It can be seen in the Let It Be film. George helps Ringo present the song to George Martin as a valid attempt to be a Beatles song. Lennon walks in, messes around on the drums but takes no active interest in it, and when McCartney walks in, the room goes silent. If this does not explain the Beatles politic, I don't know what does.<br />The production on Abbey Road is the finest of their career. Finally in 1969, The Beatles could sound like they were supposed to sound.<br />As far as it being a Beatles album where they're all unified and coming together to make it good one last time? Well its not really the case. Lennon's hardly there, McCartney actually begins WINGS Mark I on this album, The Beatles as a backing band. Its just better produced than previous albums, and it SOUNDS like everyone's there for it. Its kind of a Beatles-faux pas. They're in spirit, not in body. Whereas Let It Be was in body, not in spirit. Its a good swan song, a high note to exit a career on.<br />For me, this album works just because it does, but also because it shines for Harrison. His guitar playing and songwriting, his help and support of Ringo, and his overall character make Abbey Road a triumph for him. Thank God they both got out after this album.ng, Gold &amp; Platinum speak volumes, and whether you're an artist who's singing about marigolds or about depravation, money talks.

006441034X|5.0|Being a school librarian I am always looking for something I can recommend to the kids...I will enjoy very much recommending this book.  I read 2-3 pbs a week so rarely consider rereading a book, yet Howl's Moving Castle is making me think this is one to reread.  I enjoyed the characters, the plot, and the magic!  I obviously need to read more of Jones' books.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I really liked this film.  I liked it so much I went to se eit in the movies twice.  TWICE!  And I had to sit thee with ... 12 year old boys and was about to get into a debate with them on the veracity of Ms. Jolie's...eeeeeehhhhhhhh..........endowments.  She is a beautiful woman.  Beautiful in not simply an exotic way, but a naturally exotic way.  She also seems like an actress who is comfortable with what is going on around her.  I've seen her in a couple of movies and she seems very comfortable with the sihft from romance to thriller to action hero.  The plot is a little convoluted in the sense that it goes really far out on a limb about the Illuminati and the alignment of planets.  That was a little hard to believe.  That a society could exist for only one moment in time.  If maybe this happened every 50 years, that might've been more believable and the time traveling was handled nicely as more or reality altering than true going back.<BR>The action scenes are great particuliarly the aerial fight when theives break into her mansion.  I have to admit that I haven't seen anythign like that in quite some time, it was amazing and one of my all time favorite action scenes for teh amoutn of stuff going on, as well as the inventiveness of it.<BR>There wre points where the soundtrack was annoying loud and brash but it does really work well with the film.
0671004107|3.0|Carl Sagan made a name for himself by making science, and astronomy in particular, more accessible to the general public through a series of books and, of course, his TV show, \\"Cosmos\\". In the mid eighties he decided to try his hand at science fiction, the end result being this book. His goal was to speculate on what a possible contact (hence the title) would be like from intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, and to the extent he sticks with this theme, his book makes for a highly engaging read. Unfortunately, he just couldn't resist going off on a number of different tangents, which is really too bad, since what he mostly does is reveal his own ignorance and prejudices as opposed to offering up enlightenment.<br />What's best about this book? Well, as to be expected, the actual core story, which is, of course, about what happens when a project designed to detect signals from alien civilizations actually makes contact with one. Sagan, who in real life was a passionate supporter of the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) Project, brings his expertise to bear, and the result is a thoughtful and imaginative take of how just such an encounter might occur. As the story begins, we are introduced to Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an expert on radio astronomy, as she and her team intercept and start to decode what is clearly a message from outer space. In due time the signal, which has multiple layers woven together, is translated, the result is a set of plans for a complex machine, the purpose of which is impossible to determine. After much international debate, the machine is built, and Arroway and four companions, noted scientists from around the globe, enter the completed machine, start it up, and are whisked of to some unknown portion of the galaxy to commune with the beings who sent the message. Giving credit where due, Sagan serves up a nice mixture of science, speculation, and mysticism as his tale unfolds.<br />The problem, however, is Sagan simply can't leave well enough alone. As a science writer, Sagan excels, but as a novelist, he's got much to learn. With the exception of Arroway, most of the character development is poor and there are some rather odd plot developments, most notably a bizarre twist at the very end concerning Arroway's stepfather. But bad writing isn't the primary fault, hubris is. For some reason, people like Dr. Sagan, who are brilliant in one realm of human endeavour, begin to think themselves as experts in others in which they are actually quite clueless. This shows up in a number of spots in this book, but none more notable than his efforts to put religion in its place. Sagan himself is apparently an atheist, which is fine, but he devotes a rather large portion of the book to, for lack of a better term, shoving his views down our throat. He does this by having Arroway engage in a number of \\"debates\\" with a pair of preachers, which by itself wouldn't be bad, except that he resorts to the classic \\"straw man\\" tactic, which is to say, rigging the contest by having the opposition represented by easily refuted buffoons. In this case, the preachers are, for the most part, ignorant bible thumpers who spout clich&eacute;s about Creationism and other sundry topics, the end result being, of course, that Arroway (and, by extension, Sagan) comes across as sensible, rational, and enlightened while religion is shown mainly as a tool for exploiting people's fear and stupidity. It's one thing for Sagan to use a work of fiction to expound his opinions on religion, but at the very least he should have had the intellectual honesty to give the opposition a fair hearing. There are any number of learned theologians and religious scholars, rabbis, and so forth who could have been used as the basis for an intelligent argument in favor of religion, but Sagan probably didn't want to risk having to examine his own views too deeply for fear of finding that perhaps they weren't as infallible as he thinks.<br />And that,in a nutshell, is my principal complaint. Sagan has always been an articulate advocate for science, and a passionate supporter of anything that adds to our knowledge and understanding of the universe. His experience as an astronomer and his work with SETI put him in a near perfect position to write a fictional account of a possible contact with extraterrestrial life, and that part of the book is thoroughly enjoyable. It's only when he ventures off onto other subjects, most notably, his obvious dislike of religion, that he starts to make a fool of himself. It was notable that, when a movie based on this book was made; they cut out most of the extraneous stuff and focused the central issue, the \\"Contact\\" with another civilization in the universe. This book is by no means bad, and contains quite a bit of thought provoking material, but to be perfectly blunt, if someone were to ask my recommendation, I'd suggest they see the movie instead.a nutshell, is my principal complaint.

B000002UAU|4.0|Okay. Maybe I'm asking too much of pop culture here. We all know what pop means. It is instantly accessible, homogenised versions of ART, made accessible and sellable to a mass market of individuals who regard ART as entertainment, escapist excursions, not to be takien seriously as contributing to the social fabric of the human race. That is Pop. To expect more from it or less from it I cannot do.<br />Sgt.Pepper is pop, no doubt. It is an everyman's version of 1967 and in general 60's pop formula, except on one instance. More of that later. The ART of this piece of work is the musicianship, the songwriting technique and the craftsmanship of the recording. It is the greatest pop album of its time sheerly on those merits. The Beatles had the money and the talent to produce great pieces of musical art, but where does it escape being POP.<br />Well with McCartney & Lennon it doesn't. This is McCartney's album for sure, being dominated by his visions of what the Summer of Love was all about. I think any blame or any credit should go to him for Sgt.Pepper's lack of depth or aspirations of high art. Lyrically, McCartney does provide escapist entertainment. I do not need to tell anyone that escapist entertainment IS the backbone of pop culture and that a vast majority of us ask no more or no less from movies, magazines, books,art or music. McCartney is forever the entertainer that believes that ignorance is bliss. Lyrically on McCartney's end, the strongest composition is 'She's Leaving Home' merely because it addresses something that may happen in your house or your family at one time. Its the closest he has gotten to being Ray Davies. The rest of the songs McCartney composed give Sgt.Pepper that every one will be pleased feeling, the parents, kids, critics, paundits, George Martin, the marketers. No song takes a lyrical stab at any great socially relevant or biting issue, it stays safe and secure and does not challenge, other than slight hints of erotica and spousal abuse. It is pop. Well played, ARTISTIC pop, finely crafted, but pop nonetheless.<br />Lennon's contribution is smaller but no less pop itself. Where McCartney lets the parents and kids onto the psychedelic roundabout they've all heard was going on in 1967, Lennon introduces them to the psychedelics involved. But at the same time, lyrically nothing is said. It eludes to drug taking, it says possibly something is under the surface, but never transcends psychedlic pop. Musically and artistically, the innovations are more apparent on the Lennon tracks, but when compared to Arthur Lee's LOVE, Pink Floyd's Piper At The Gates of Dawn, Jimi Hendrix's Experience, it is hardly psychedelic as it is an introduction to psychedelia. The bystander's and skeptics introduction to flowerpower and Haight Ashbury. It actually seems more Lewis Carroll than psychedelic.<br />Ringo's playing throughout this album should hail this man as one of the best drummers ever recorded, who sacrificed ego for the sake of the song. 'A Day In The Life' you know as well for its drum fills as for its symphonic chaos and arrangement.<br />And then you get Harrison. And anyone who's read previous reviews of mine will probably say, great, here he goes again. But I'll keep saying it until I get through. 'Within You Without You' is not pop. It gets overshadowed by McCartney's overall Pepperness and Lennon's overall placebo LSD for the masses. It gets derided for its Eastern instrumentation which is not POP therefore gets cast aside even though the musicianship and talents of eastern musicians tends to make pop music look like people playing on tinkertoys. Harrison became the first man to truly blend Eastern and Western music, AND lyrically achieve a depth that was not had in The Beatles catalogue before 1967. Lennon's 'In My Life' started going there in 1965, but he stopped as soon as he went exploring the drug culture. When Harrison explored that same drug culture, he came out of it with something profound andwholly universal.<br />Harrison introduced Western culture to 'World Music' singlehandedly, whether you like it or not. THAT is a statement in itself. When you fade the lines between cultures, you bring people closer together. When you keep those lines defined, we are kept apart. Harrison began in 1966 making his partners look more and more like pop geniuses, and himself as the artist of The Beatles. He did not offer saccharine versions of 1967 to the masses, and its why most people skip over the song. They never glimpse the truth that that song is one of the most beautifully recorded songs in 'pop' history. Lennon, McCartney and Starr all have said it was the best song on Sgt. Pepper.<br />Its the only 5 minutes and 3 seconds I listen to on this album anymore.<br />THIS IS POP. Artistic pop, but nonetheless. Make it no more or no less than what it is. Because McCartney & Lennon didn't.nd wholly universal. <br />Harrison introduced Western culture to 'World Music' singlehandedly, whether you like it or not. THAT is a statement in itself.

B000062XKL|4.0|All of the actors in this film are great.  And by great, I mean they easily disappear into their characters and become believeable.  The chemistry between DeNiro and Bassett works as does Marlon Brando, who it's almost impossible to believe is an actor.  Brando slips into character so easily that it's a little disturbing to see him in one performance to the next, he's both a presence larger than himself and at the same time invisible to being detected.  As always Ed Norton is very good too as someone who is ultimately challenging DeNiro's character to break his rules.<BR>The problem with this film is the plot.  There's a lot of characters here but the plot isn't as meaty as they are.  I often complain about the letdown of the third act but somewhere there was distress in the secodn act, I believe and the third act balances the promise of the first but is lost to being a conenctive part to what the second should've built about.  The heist is a little simplsitic and the double cross apparent in a formulaic way.  I think that movies come up against the wall of Doing Harm to The Lead Characters as a plot derailer.  By having to avoid the \\"hero\\" either losing or dying, films have to redeem him or her at the end in often flat ways.   The desire for sequels must also permeate this thought as does the marketing perception of a movie.  However it often costs really good casts assemblage making incredible movies.<BR>Watch thsi for the talent but not the story.

B00006YXEK|5.0|I don't feel I can adequately sum up anything about this album.<br />Just about everytime since 1976 Harrison released an album, critics and fans said it was his best since All Things Must Pass (barring Somewhere in England and Gone Troppo). The same criticisms about his spirituality and his lack of 'pop' sensibility or what sells at any given moment did not blur the fact that of the 4 solo Beatles, his had the greatest depth and clarity of vision. He never went back on things he said before, he stuck true to his convictions and compromised for no one's appraisal. The 1979 'George Harrison' album is one of the most beautifully played and gorgeous sounding Harrison release, with wonderful love songs, acute observations about people and relationships, and his sense of humour coming through. 'Your Love Is Forever' is 1979's 'Something'.<br />Cloud Nine spoke to the pop audience, and again its said Harrison had the talents to be the top of the pops when he wanted to. Of the 4, the most successful 'chart wise' has been McCartney, but surprisingly enough, Harrison is next in line, especially when you don't discount Ringo's successful ventures in the charts were Harrison produced, supported or co-written.<br />The fact is, Harrison never made a COMEBACK. He always had the talent to be top of the pops, but it didn't interest him. It seems to be that it was the last thing on his mind.<br />BRAINWASHED I approached upon release with a great amount of sadness. He was already gone, and this was to be the last we ever will hear of this man who never got the credit he deserved as a humanitarian, as an artist, as the introducer of eastern idealogy to the western masses, as the first pop idol to use his name to save lives, the saviour of the dying British film industry, the first Beatle to make social commentary in their song catalogue (Taxman) when they were decreed simply a pop band. The world did not realise what it had missed, but I, and others who thoroughly appreciated the beauty that was George Harrison knew the loss. This was the man when asked if The Beatles were getting back together for The Concert for Bangladesh, shot back at the reporter, 'don't you think we should be talking about the people who are dying in Bangladesh.' The man of principles and great spiritual conviction was gone. The man who backed Monty Python's 'Life of Brian' when no one else would touch it, proved that the public and media had no concept of what Harrison was about, and did not understand the irony that the film itself and its producer presented.<br />BRAINWASHED is Harrison in great form. At first 'Stuck Inside A Cloud' didn't hit me right away. Songs like 'Brainwashed', 'Pisces Fish', 'Looking For My Life' and 'Run So Far' did. Harrison's sense of melody is every bit as good as McCartney's ever is, but his lyrics have always been deep and meaningful whereas McCartney's ...to me.... aren't. And then 'Stuck Inside A Cloud' hit me. Beneath the slightly cheery music is such a sad song of isolation and feeling alone and scared, that I can now not hear the song without sadly singing along and feeling every portion of what Harrison was trying to put across.<br />I'll say that this is Harrison's best work since All Things Must Pass to satisfy those that keep judging it against that. And then I'll say I'm so sorry this was the last thing we are going to hear from this man. He had so many good things to say about the spirit, and the mind, and the heart, all throughout his solo career and in The Beatles, that things have just not been the same for me since he died. A huge part of my heart went with him, but I don't mind so much. It was a good part.eauty that was George Harrison knew the loss.

B00003CXE7|1.0|It is a great action movie.  Keyword there is action.  Best picture is supposed to be a drama, and Gladiator is far from and excellent drama.  In fact all the dramatic scenes were pretty bogus.  I cant even believe people voted Gladiator the best-best picture of all time.  Gladiator should never have won best picture.  If action movies won at the oscars than why hasn't Arnold won an oscar.  Arnold's action beats Ridley Scott's any day.  Another epic by another Aussie is 6 thousand times better: Braveheart.  William Wallace has chunks of guys like Maximus in his stool.  Braveheart is far and away a better best picture candidate.  In fact every other best picture winner is better than Gladiator, because Gladiator never should have won best picture.
B00003CY0V|2.0|There's lots of style and flash in this film.   A topless Halle Berry---I really didn't see the hoopla over her boobla-------and some interesting special effects with computers and graphics but ultimately its a Mission Impossible episode gone on too long.  John Travolta over acts----hopefully on purpose.  Halle Berry plays sultry and shocked---two notes, and Jackman plays reluctantly moral.  Everyone is \\"playing\\" something and why is that?  I think it's because Dominic Sena's direction is really great here.  The use of slow motion and angle shifting is really inspired and it's very difficult to create balance.  Great direction may mean lackluster acting or a shoddy script.  It takes a lot to bring all three of these elements together into a synthesis.  Its a little scary when I actually liked teh special effects more than a film.

As far as being compared to Dave Matthews....they sound a bit similar, but John sounds much better.  I first fell in love with his music after seeing this MTV video...or commercial that kept showing him performing \\"No Such Thing\\".  My favorite song on the album right now is \\"St. Patrick's Day\\".  Last week it was \\"City Love\\".  I wonder what it will be next week...
0451207521|5.0|This is a real page-turner.  The characters are finely drawn, including the most minor ones.  The plot is intricate and thoroughly believable.  The reader is left with a feeling of awe at the courage and dedication, not to mention cleverness and adaptability, of the French Resistance.  I have been a Follett fan since EYE OF THE NEEDLE, and am happy that the quality continues as stunning as it began.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It goes without saying that Ok Computer is one of the greatest albums ever, and if you don't own it, you don't know what you're missing. In a world where pop has completely taken over the music industry, rock fans need to fight back. Radiohead, although they are one the most important rock band in the world today (and my favorite), have veered slightly off-track from this recent classic with three albums that don't quite give you the same rush. However, with this 1997 masterpiece and 1995's The Bends, they have set the groundwork for what will hopefully be a rock n' roll revolution. When all is said and done and the pop stars fade away, Ok Computer's brilliance will prevail.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Not having listened to Wilco's other works I had nothing to compare this to, but I don't see that as a disadvantage.  This album is just spectacular, and I am very happy to see that the label who dropped them loses out on the profits of the album for years to come.  The thing that excites me about this album is its potential staying power.  I feel like this album could have been made 30 years ago or 30 years from now.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot seems like something that will remain in my collection for a long time and will be something I can recommend to future generations looking for older artists to appreciate.
B000003BD3|4.0|This CD is probably not for those who are new to Jethro Tull, the Stones, or John Lennon. For the rest of us, however, this is one step closer to nirvanah (not the band).<br />The little between the songs circus music rates 5/5 stars. Not that its special for the music itself, but it adds a great circus feel to the whole event.<br />The intros by the Stones and Lennon are about 3/5 which isn't bad considering the announcers that were invited said \\"no\\" and left the event announcerless. The most interesting of these is track 11, a dialog between John and Mick.<br />Now for the songs:<br />\\"Song For Jeffrey\\"- Jethro Tull<br />One of the band's earlier songs before they were hugely popular. Good playing by all four members, with good flute parts from Ian Anderson. Not Tull's best but still (as always) very good. 4/5 stars.<br />\\"A Quick One While He's Away\\"- The Who<br />The Who's first \\"opera\\". Very well preformed. This song is probably one of my favourite Who tracks. Easily 5/5 stars.<br />\\"Ain't That A Lot of Love\\"- Taj Mahal<br />Not terrible, considering Mahal's presence in England had to be kept a secret.Not the best voice, but not hideous. 3/5 stars.<br />\\"Something Better\\"- Marianne Faithfull<br />An annoying song thrown in here because Marianne was Mick's girlfriend. Still, like before, not hideous. 2.5/5 stars.<br />\\"Yer Blues\\"- The Dirty Mac<br />The supergroup who's name was in response to Fleetwood Mac is very good. This song isn't quite as good as the album version, but just watch these four guys jamming together and its awesome no matter what. 5/5 stars. (I'm Sure they<br />\\"Whole Lotta Yoko\\"- The Dirty Mac with Yoko Ono and Ivry Gitlis<br />Let me just start off by saying I am NOT a fan of Yoko Ono's music. However, I don't understand what people are so upset about her being on here, her contribution is actually decent GIVEN THE SONG. With the wailing violin her voice fits in. On any other song, it wouldn't. 5/5 stars.<br />\\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\"- The Rolling Stones<br />Not a very strong start for the Stones. For some reason they sound a little off here. A little boring, considering we've all heard the other version. 3/5 stars.<br />\\"Parachute Woman\\"- The Rolling Stones<br />A step up from \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\". The Stones are much more loose here and sound excelent, only lacking a little vocal energey. 4/5 stars.<br />\\"No Expectations\\"- The Rolling Stones<br />A slower song, well preformed with Brian Jones on slide guitar. Mick sounds better here. 4/5 stars.<br />\\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\"- The Rolling Stones<br />EXCELLENT! I prefer this one to the original version. An excellent version of this song minus the opening chior segments. Mick sounds great. 5/5 stars.<br />\\"Sympathy For the Devil\\"- The Rolling Stones<br />This is awesome! An eight and a half minute version of this classic tune. Was there ever a song more perfect for the person singing it? This is as good as if not better than the studio version! 5/5 stars.<br />\\"Salt Of the Earth\\"- The Rolling Stones<br />A very fitting closer to the evening. 4/5 stars.<br />Great show!
B00003CXXM|5.0|A friend and I watched the Bourne Identity on a fluke. We were on our way back from dinner and decided last minute to stop and rent a movie and this was the first one to catch our eyes. It was about 20 minutes into the film that we realized this was going to be an awesome movie. There were so many cool action scenes. It is an &quot;edge of your seat&quot; spy thriller about a government agent who is pulled out of the ocean with two bullet holes in his back and turns out to have amnesia and cannot remember who he is. However, a bunch of natural instincts start coming to him, like when two cops confront him and he beats both of them up in like 3 seconds flat. <br />This movie has so many awesome action scenes. There is even a car chase with a Mini Cooper. The story was a little confusing and I still do not understand many parts of it, but the movie was so great that I really do not care. I figure I will watch it again many more times and eventually figure out all that was going on.
B000068W51|5.0|The Whitey Album is definitely my most favorite and apparently sought after music selection.  I heard it at a friend's house this summer and have wanted it in my music library ever since.  There are some familiarities in the retro-80s-flashback songs.  \\"Addicted to Love\\"  is one of the best 80s covers I've heard yet.  It's fun, laid back and all together a well done collection of sounds.  Like I said, I give it 5 stars. *****
B00006F7S4|4.0|I used to have a real distaste for slow folky music.  Then I realized that I was just listening to the wrong slow folky music.  Beck's latest offering, Sea Change, provides an example as to what is right in slow folky music.  When I typically think of slow folky music I envision a guy on stage with an acoustic guitar singing about something that I cannot relate too.  Beck sometimes performs songs from this album in this style, but for the most part the tracks on this album are beautifully rich and layered.  In some parts there are strings, horns, and woodwinds.  It makes for a wonderful combination and something that will by very listenable for years to come.
0451167716|5.0|Many people consider the film to be the best of all time.  Well the quality of the movie doesn't come close to the book.  A good deal of the book seems like we are reading a true account instead of fiction.  Several of the characters that had minor roles in the movie, have much larger roles and are actually quite interesting in the book (ex. Johnny Fontaine, Moe Greene, Lucy).  Puzo seemed to have the masters touch when it came to story telling.
B000060P79|5.0|I really love this group! They are one of the best I've in a long time I just love every single song on here and the videos are awesome too!  My favorite songs are I'd Do Anything5/5, You Don't Mean Anything5/5, I'm Just a Kid5/5, Addicted5/5, and Grow Up5/5.  You should really get this if you are into Punk, Pop/punk, rock or just want to here some great music then this ones for you!
B00006RAKP|5.0|This Greatest Hits Collection is worth every penny. It has 34 of his greatest hits that include Crocodile Rock, Bennie &amp; The Jets, &amp; Sad Songs(Say So Much). Plus, a bonus CD with 4 songs like Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me(duet with George Michael). The Only flaw to this Collection is that it is missing some of Elton John's signature songs from the 70's, like Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Lucy &amp; The Sky With Diamonds, &amp; Pinball Wizard. Regardless, I highly recommend buying this CD collection
B000069AUI|4.0|I worry about Coldplay.  I worry that they will get overplayed, overexposed, or overhyped, and then I won't like them anymore.  I want to like them.  Chris Martin is one of my favorite people in music to listen to.  Their use of the piano is perhaps the best use of piano on an album since the glory days of Elton John.  The two hit singles on the album, &quot;In My Place&quot; and &quot;Clocks&quot;, are great and I feel sad and inspired each time I hear them.  There are other songs such as &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, &quot;Polotik&quot;, and &quot;The Scientist&quot; that are pretty good and nice role players to the two hits.  The remaining songs are listenable, but leave some thing to be desire on the sophmore offering from the band.  If faced with a decision on whether to buy the first of second album all over again, I would go with the first.  It is a much more even and delicious album, but you won't be disappointed with this one either.  It's like winning a free steak dinner instead of a free steak and lobster dinner.
B000003N7G|5.0|John Coltrane is a master.  He is the greatest saxophonist to ever touch the instrument.  This CD is one of themost powerful sounds ever recorded.  Elvin Jones lights up this album with his distinctive and masterful drumming, and McCoy with his virtoustic ability.  Jimmy Garrison takes a long but stunning solo, and the whole group is on fire as they record this.  This is not only a Jazz album, it is for rock and other music lovers too.  This is one of the most essential if not the most essential Jazz album out there.  It ranks with Kind of Blue as a masterpeice.
B00005RYL9|5.0|The idea behind the original Highlander film made for an intriguing story that unfortunately could not be equalled by its sequels--tampering with so basically succesful a tale was virtually guaranteed to result in failure.<br />For those uninitiated to the Highlander plotline, the idea is fairly simple: that amongst humanity live a small group of immortals who can only die by decapitation.  These immortals seem normal humans until their first death, which \\"sets\\" them forever at that age.  They forever are involved in fighting each other, for when one takes the head of another, he gains their powers in the \\"quickening,\\" and at some point in the future when very few immortals remain, they will come together for one last battle (the \\"Gathering\\") in which there can be only one survivor--who will then win the prize, a gift of immense power.<br />That's where the film takes up the action, though it does also focus on past events in the characters' lives through flashbacks later used to great extent in the spin-off television show.  Connor MacLeod (played by Christopher Lambert) is one of the few remaining immortals when the Gathering is at hand, and he must both battle the evil Kurgan (Clancy Brown) and keep his sword battles from drawing too much interest from modern-day police detectives who unsurprisingly are keen to track down murderers leaving behind headless bodies.<br />Sean Connery plays the ancient immortal and Connor's mentor Ramirez in many of the flashback sequences to great effect--so much so that film producers tried to reintroduce his character in the second and far less satisfying sequel.<br />The format of interspersed historical flashbacks and the modern-day chase sequences serves the film well, giving the characters background and laying out the rules by which they interact in the Game.  The soundtrack done by Queen also works quite well in context.  Overall, the movie is fairly unique in its story and does a good job exploring the at-times torured psyches of the immortals.<br />As for the particulars of the DVD transfer, the video quality is fairly decent--far superior to the VHS, but still a bit dark and murky at points.  The audio mix is fairly good as well, and the second disc features music by Queen (available on their album \\"A Kind of Magic\\").  Overall, the added features of this edition do not revolutionize the film to separate it from previous versions, but they are worthwhile and provide for a more well-rounded and enjoyable film than earlier editions.hes of the immortals.<br />As for the particulars of the DVD transfer, the video quality is fairly decent--far superior to the VHS, but still a bit dark and murky at points.

0449002632|4.0|My adult niece gave me Rutherfurd's second book, RUSSKA, as a Christmas gift several years ago. I enjoyed it so much that I went looking for SARUM, and I've since purchased his two more recent books. As I write this review, I have put THE FOREST aside for awhile because Rutherfurd's works can be overwhelming to read one after another.<br />LONDON's twenty-one self-contained tales begin in 54 B.C., and follow several families through often intertwining generations until 1997. We're there when each acquires its surname. We watch as those surnames change; as fortunes are made and lost; as respectability and social status wax and wane, for those who come to call themselves \\"Bull\\" and \\"Ducket,\\" \\"Doggett\\" and \\"Silversleeves,\\" \\"Meredith\\" and \\"Barnikel.\\" Each story carries the unique flavor of the era depicted, and each deals with that time period's defining events.<br />I've heard Rutherfurd compared to James A. Michener, and with that I certainly agree. Both writers concentrate on a particular geographic area, and tell the story of that area's people over a grand sweep of time. However, I do not see Rutherfurd's characters (or Michener's, for that matter) as figures sketched in for the storyteller's convenience. Each major character in the pages of LONDON is created in enough carefully chosen detail to take on individual life. I particularly enjoyed meeting such colorful figures as \\"Dame Barnikel,\\" who founded a dynastic brewery in a time when most married women controlled no property; the Doggett sisters, twin prostitutes with far more respectable descendants; and Helen Meredith, aristocratic ambulance driver during the Blitz.<br />A great deal of background for each tale is presented to the reader in narrative, \\"telling instead of showing\\" format; but Rutherfurd's alternative would have been writing twenty-one novels, because each of his self-contained chapters contains enough material for a complete book. His work feels more condensed than Michener's, and that undoubtedly is why.<br />What these two epic writers have in common is their storytelling's richness. LONDON supplied me with a good, long, thoroughly engrossing read!dly is why.<br />What these two epic writers have in common is their storytelling's richness.

B00003CXI0|4.0|I am not a fan of the Harry Potter books but this movie was entertaining.  I watched it on cable one day and found myself sitting down to watch it instead of flipping the channels.  This movie will take your mind off of other things.  It did mine.
B000002JSR|4.0|It's not bad.  I understand those that think this album is great and those that think that it's not so great; they're both right.  The first side contains some really good live cuts, \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" and \\"Can't Quit You Baby\\", and two decent songs.(\\"Poor Tom\\" and \\"Walter's Walk\\")<br />The second side sounds like an unpolished, yet harder rocking ITTOD.  I would of rather seen \\"Ozone Baby\\", \\"Darlene\\", or especially \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" replace tracks 4 -6 on ITTOD.  \\"W&T\\" kicks major [behind]!  My biggest complaint about the entire album is \\"Bonzo's Montreaux\\", I understand that drum solo's are take'em or leave'em, but the synth programs are just too much.<br />I actually prefer most of these tracks over some of the [stuff] that was on ITTOD (aka \\"Carouselambra\\").  While definetly Zep's worst, it's still a decent CD.  Not a great classic, but something different to pop in every once in a while.
B00000DLVA|5.0|I love this CD, EVERY song on here is absolute brilliance. I love every song, the lyrics are exceptional, it's a masterpiece!
B00005B36H|5.0|When I first purchased Opiate in 92 I've since followed Tool and their progress. I was enticed by the lyrics Keenan produced, and their music is up there with the greats. In fact, I can't think of anyone who can drum like that.<br />I bought all of their albums, but this is my favorite. It mixes soothing lyrics with amazing instrumentals. Stand out tracks are No. 2-3(they link in perfectly), even though I don't know their names, and Parabola(My favorite all time song). Parabola brings a new vibe to music. I love the guitar solo not too far inward, and the drumming is the best I've EVER heard. This song makes the whole album worth getting. Even if you hate every other track.<br />Buy the album.

B000089RVX|5.0|The incredible sounds produced by this band go beyond my ability to describe them with words.  As stated hundreds of times, Any Lee's voice is mind-blowing, and the music backing her up is just as good.  In many songs, an ensemble of guitars, violins, a chorus, a piano and more provide a very full and rich sound.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this to any music lover.
0151006903|5.0|Baudolino is a story of a habitual liar whose lies get him in and out of the most outlandish type of trouble imaginable.<BR><br />Monsters, creatures, cities to conquer!  Battles, crazy emperors, artifacts!  These are just a very few parts of Bauodolino's adventures.  In a way, this novel is even better than Eco's famous The Name of the Rose as it covers the medieval world and its myths in a broader and more lighthearted way, mostly amusing the writer while taking from the world of mythology, mysticism, history, and politics.  <BR><br />Eco is a great creator of powerful characters with whom we laugh and cry in the novels.  Baudolino despite his habits is a thoroughly likeable characters and regardless of his lies, even he once in a while offers valuable advice.<BR><br />I plan on re-reading this novel many times for I am sure that I have missed on many intricacies that Eco purposefully put in the novel.  Also, I want to re-read it to once again enjoy the excitement of traveling to the end of the world, speculating how the world is shaped, and planning on visiting the earthly paradise.
B000000H3Z|5.0|Despite their fairly high popularity level, for a metal band, Sepultura has never seemed to get the kind of respect they deserve. They general have been placed behind all the big American thrash bands in the great hierarchy of metal bands, which is a shame, because they make some killer music. Frankly, this album and the later Arise surpass anything I've ever heard from Slayer, Anthrax or Megadeth, and are as good or better than anything Metallica has done other than Master of Puppets.  Sure, they may be a bit derivative, but well, pretty much all the other thrash bands were inspired by Metallica anyway, so that's no more valid a criticism of them than anyone else. And besides, innovation is nice, but it's not the main concern. Sometimes, most of the time, really, it's good just to do something many others do better, than just about anybody else, which is precisely what Sepultura has done with this album.<br />I'll get my one complaint out of the way. Max's vocals aren't very good on this album. They aren't obnoxiously bad, but they're nothing special, and they're 100 times better on Arise, where they became deeper and more intense. They do have a distinct flavor here, as Max has an extremely thick accent and clearly doesn't speak English well at all. Still, this is a minor complaint.<br />Stylistically, this album is sort of mid-way between Reign in Blood and mid 80's Metallica, combining the increased speed with the longer, more intricate structures. This album is flat-out the most intense thrash album I've ever heard.(it's death-thrash, really) Sure, it may let up more than Reign in Blood, but not too much, and when it really gets going it's heavier AND faster than anything on RiB. From a sheer technical standpoint, it's hard to believe how young these guys were(18-20 years). Though the songs aren't terribly long, they avoid conventional pop structures, and sometimes go beyond the standard thrash structure.(long intro-2verses/choruses-long instrumental-chorus.) Beyond that, they simply have a nearly absurd number of riff changes, more than just about any metal album I can think of. Igor's drumming is very nicely done, not as complex as it would become but still very powerful. Andreas' leads are strong as well, particularly on Inner Self and Lobotomy.<br />There isn't any filler here, though 2 tracks, Sarcastic Existence and Hungry are merely good rather than great.  It opens up with the title track, which, minus the intro, is a very Slayer-like song, with a blazingly fast opening 2 verses giving way to a slower, groovier bridge, coming back to the chorus.(a la War Ensemble, Angel of Death, Ghosts of War etc.) Inner Self is one of the slower tracks, with the strongest solo on the album. Mass Hypnosis is probably may favorite track on the album. It's got a simply unbelieveble amount of energy and power, with a slower, memorable chorus contrasted with lightning fast and staccatto rhythm guitar abuse in the verses.  Slaves of Pain also stands out, with another great chorus. The last real standout track is the closer, Primitive Future, which is perhaps the most explosively energetic thrash track I've ever heard, and truly a perfect way to close an outstanding album.  The bonus tracks don't add too much, but I don't think too much about them either way, since they aren't truly part of the album.<br />Anyways, thrash rules, Sepultura rules thrash, therefore, buy Sepultura.Beyond that, they simply have a nearly absurd number of riff changes, more than just about any metal album I can think of.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Like myself, this review will be short and simple...<br />Monty Python, famous Brittish comedy troop whoose surreal and outragous sense of humour earned them a place in the Hall Of Hillarity, decide, with a barrel full of jokes and a matchbox full of money to make a movie.<br />This is the result, it's one of their best and my favourite, and I'm actually Brittish so I know what I'm talking about.<br />The DVD's extras are good; the commentaries being the highlight. Sound and picture quality too, for an old film, look superb.<br />Click that add to shopping cart button now otherwise I will come round to your house and say 'Nee' at you rather loudly.<br />Like myself, this review has been a perfect example of the epitamy of it's kind and will live on as a legend in it's own time, thank you.
0064407667|2.0|When I first heard of this series, I was mildly intrigued.  Then I heard the series being likened to Roald Dahl's books, and, having worn my childhood copy of *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* to bits, I had to check them out.  Mr. Snicket is no Roald Dahl.  Sure, both writers understand that a lot of kids like to read about pretty gruesome stuff.  But, where Dahl's stories are inventive and charming, *The Bad Beginning* is pretty simplistic and derivative.  Things seemed to resolve themselves a bit too quickly.  It's not a bad book, just not worthy of its hype.  If I happened to find the next book in the series lying in the street, I'd probably read it, but otherwise, probably not.
B000056VJ7|5.0|I love this album. It belongs up there with 'Dark Side of the Moon', 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' and the more recent 'OK Computer' as one of the greatest pieces of work ever commited to tape. It is, to be blunt, genius... but twisted genius!<br />It all began back in the 70s when after years of peddling their songs to record companies who would reject on the spot, Meat and writer Jim Steinman finally found someone to take a gamble and produce their radical work. Flash forward 25 years, why would anyone still want to listen to a man who went out of fashion along with flairs and the afro, singing songs penned by a man who used to sleep against a fridge containing unidentified, florescent matter? <br />I'll tell you why... Meat Loaf has that extraordinary voice that effortlessly floats over the soft piano of Heaven Can Wait, belts out Bat Out Of Hell like his lungs are the engine of a Harley and weeps with teenage angst in Paradise By The Dashboard Lights, complimented by Ellen Folly?s sharp, dominatrix tones. Meat?s upbringing in theatre has enabled him to get inside the heads of the characters that Steinman writes for him. Steinman?s writing is like nothing you?ve ever heard; He takes the passion and theatrical style of Broadway Musicals, adds his own pounding approach to piano playing, mixes that with wailing and sometimes guttural guitars and sprinkles on top Meat?s vocals as melodic as any pop song. <br />This incredible combination of talent is, unfortunately, something that is becoming a rarity among the artists of today. They don?t make ?em like this anymore and although that is a pity, I?d snap this one up as reminder of the good old days. I wasn?t around in the good old days myself, I?m only sixteen years old and it?s unfair that the media and people in general expect everyone my age to be into Nu-Metal, Garage, Hip Hop and whatever other words companies adapt to basically mean incoherant noise. <br />Don?t be put off though, you?re not buying a piece of camp70s nostalgia, as some reviews have criticized it as being. Every song is an individual work of art; gradiose, bombastic, eccentric and eclectic... and this is in no way a bad thing. After all the Sistine Chapel isn't exactly subtle.
B0000640SA|5.0|I hadn't really read much about Memento, although I did question some friends about a couple aspects. I knew the basic story was about a man who can't make new memories due to the murder of his wife and a bump to the head.<br />The movie is told in scenes, chronologically reversed. So now we have a man who can't make new memories with a movie told in reverse. Oh, and it's a Film Noir murder mystery because he's also trying to find the killer of his wife.<br />Really, you have to fight your way through the story but that's what makes this such a great movie. The ending is a bit of a twister, a snake eating its own tail.<br />Somehow this movie merges a dreamlike quality with a sharp reality. I woke up this morning thinking about it.<br />Magical.
0393317552|5.0|In GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL, Jared Diamond does a masterful job of coming up with a theory of the differences in environmental conditions that ultimately led to the domination of Eurasians in the world.  The foundation of the theory is extremely well built, making it for a coherent and well thought out book.  The main parts include:<br />1) Agriculture - the author explains how agriculture evolved first in the Fertile Crescent (today's Middle East) and expanded to the rest of the world.  He makes a good case for why it developed only much later in the Americas and Africa, and never in Australia.<br />2) Herding - another interesting point, as the author demonstrates why animal herding grew in Eurasia but not in the Americas or Africa.<br />3) Connection to political structure - the author proceeds to make the connection between agriculture and political structure, with plenty of empirical evidence.  It is pretty amazing to see how archeologists take the smallest clues to come up with interesting theories.<br />4) Political structure to germs and technology - that connection is, in my opinion, the most interesting one.  The author is not the one to come up with this theory, but he is the one who put it all together for the layman.  He shows how smallpox evolved from animals to men, and why it happened in Eurasia rather than anywhere else.<br />5) Germs and technology to domination - finally, he connects the dots that lead from having germs and technology to dominating other peoples.<br />I am truly impressed by the rationality of the argument.  The only flaw I noticed is that the author is clearly biased in thinking that the environment was the sole major cause of everything.  Though politically correct to blame the environment, there may be other causes, such as culture, that play a significant role in the fates of societies.  For example, Larry Harrison makes this case in \\"Culture Matters\\".<br />Overall, very impressive work of scholarship, deserves all the prizes it has gotten, and I will definitely incorporate these theories into my way of thinking.  This book is a 10.t has gotten, and I will definitely incorporate these theories into my way of thinking.  This book is a 10.
6302516919|4.0|This movie wastes no time getting to the scarry part.  The beginning is scarry and somewhat violent.  Movie has it's humor spots and Teenage love scenes; but for the most part, it is scarry and violent!  Don't let your kids under 13 watch it; cause it has some real violent scenes in it.  I mean full view violent, like a car hitting a person running from it; and there is NO DRIVER in the car.  Movie capitalizes on showing had bad a person can be injured by a car; by running over a person, squeezing them in the front seat, causing fire at a gas station.  The car itself, is EVIL.  Enough said.  Has good ending though.  Actors and Actresses are very good in this movie.  Movie is more fictional than real life.  Has some real life scenes; but mainly is a horror movie; and it will get to you.  The music in this movie is classic, 1950s rock and roll, and very good.  You will love hearing songs in this movie; if you you are into 1950s rock and roll.  Lots of good hits in this movie.  The car's radio only plays 1950s songs, all the time.  Horror movie with Classic Car.
0345440900|1.0|I had myself in tears trying to implement these techniques.  I agree with one of the other reviews that she doesn't give any clues as to how to make a baby sleep.  Most babies DON'T put themselves to sleep when laid down in a crib. HA! You can't \\"spoil\\" an infant and the advice given in the book basically takes the love out of having a child...too rigid.  I know it may work for some but odn't kill yourself trying to do the \\"schedule\\" thing that seems to be so popular with this generation of new mom's.
B00001U0E1|1.0|Like American Beauty, Shakespeare in Love paid off critics, bullied voters, and kissed posterior to win its Oscar, realizing its hilariously bad plot and absolutely wooden lead actress could have killed it if allowed a fair viewing. Basically ignoring the true originas of Romeo and Juliet (written for a man, by the way--the sonnets, anyone? wait, these are Hollywood critics) and basically putting in a hodgepodge of &quot;Oh, we're famous, nominate us!&quot; British actors.<br />This movie supposes that if you make the scenery believable (i.e. the stink of the theater, the overcrowded conditions, etc.), an audience will ignore the fact that Gweneth Paltrow is amazingly clean shaven for a 16th century woman, and that the characters act as if they all tacitly took a time warp from a bad Reese Witherspoon Romantic comedy (but I repeat myself). <br />The worst part of this movie is Paltrow, whose father bought her this oscar, thus continuing the Hollywood nepotism trick that earned Cage, Sorvino, and Monkey-lips (Anjolina Jolie) their undeserved Oscars. Quick, name any line any of thes acotrs said in their winning roles? Exaclt.y They didn't deserve one of them. Paltrow acts like a  blond valley girl joining a sorority (&quot;Oh my god, you guys, shutup, this is so serious!&quot;) so other morons who think buying friendship is important will go see it and pretend their deep. Never have I seen actress win so much acclaim for doing nothing--she'd be the female Kevin Spacey, but at least he's competant, if neither spectacular nor good. <br />With Paltrow mucking up every line she tries to utter through her bullmia, a plot so bad it'd be laughable if it didn't make a writer cry, and smug cameos by actors who should know better, this movie was one of the five most overrated movies of the decade.
0446677450|5.0|A good friend, and a person I have a lot of respect for, gave me this book.  I have to admit to being surprised because I initially thought this to be a typical &quot;get rich&quot; book.  Based on his recomendations I read the book.  I spent a few hours and read through the book in one sitting, it's an easy read.  It really has influenced my thinking about many things in my life.  There is more being said in this book about methodology than practical advice, and that's a good thing.  I have made some serious changes in the way I run my business and personal life.  This is a book everyone should read through and see for themselves if they can apply any of the wisdom contained.
B000000WFZ|5.0|I saw the movie last night for the first time on TV and this morning I saw it's being recomended to me.I was astonished!<BR>  Of course like the movie itself,the musical score was also haunting.And I am contemplating to buy this soundtrack as soon as possible.Besides,I always love Morricone's pieces.
B00005QIPH|3.0|I have read many reviews that say this is a great album.  While I won't disagree that there are some decent songs here, I keep thinking that all the songs sound the same.  They have the same rythym, similar chords and bass lines, and nearly identical beats.  This is a fairly short record (35 minutes), but I think they could have fit all the musical variation in about 10 minutes.  The first time I heard Last Night, I kept thinking I had just heard it, but I knew I had never listened to the album before.  Then I realized it sounded EXACTLY like Someday, which came just two songs earlier.  I bet they wrote one really good song that everybody loved, then they decided to cash in by just modifying a beat here, a note there, and writing some new lyrics, and voila, there's your album.  I gave it 3 stars because it would be the ideal album for someone with a short term memory that lasted about 3.5 minutes.
B00006IUL7|3.0|I did not feel much exitement or thrill throughout the whole flick.This version was good but still I think the original Norwegian one was better.
B000001ESJ|5.0|True to their message in \\"All The World's A Stage\\", 1977's \\"A Farewell To Kings\\" has indeed set up chapter two of their musical history. Unaware of the fact at the time that there would be a live album released after every 4 studio albums, Rush has begun a new chapter after every live album, indulging with loads of synthesizer work after \\"Exit... Stage Left\\", and heading for a more streamlined rock sound following \\"A Show Of Hands\\", and following it up with a more raw and edgy hard-rock sound after \\"Different Stages\\". \\"Vapor Trails\\", you can say, is the beginning to a fifth chapter in the annals of Rush.<br />When it comes to \\"A Farewell To Kings\\", Rush were quick to experiment with new sounds and to further expand their musical expertise. It is also their first album on which Geddy Lee plays keyboards, Alex Lifeson fiddles with guitar pedals and double-necks, and Neil Peart has built up an extensive percussion set featuring temple blocks, cowbells, marimba, tubular bells, crotales, vibra-slap, triangles, glockenspiel, and timpanis along his good ol'-fashioned Slingerland drum kit.<br />The title track starts off with an acoustic guitar introduction, followed by mellow glockenspiel and tingling of Moog keys in the background, before plunging into their amplified instruments, showcasing their unnatural ability to progress with each new album experimenting with changing time signatures and the ability of stopping for breaks before going back again. \\"Xanadu\\" is another classical piece of work, in which the band, especially Neil, gets to show off their skills on their newly-added equipment. \\"Closer To The Heart\\" has become quite a huge stage favorite in their repertoire, and they've played it on every tour following the \\"Drive Til You Die\\" tour for 20 years!(Initially, the band decided to give it a breather, although they did include it in their Mexico and Brazil dates of the Vapor Trails tour as an extra \\"treat\\"). \\"Cinderella Man\\" features lyrics penned by Geddy, afterwatching \\"Mr. Deeds Goes To Town\\" on which the song is loosely based. Here he also indulges into a more funky groove in the instrumental section, between screaming vocal parts and intricate bass playing. \\"Madrigal\\" could be considered more of a ballad, featuring a light drum beat from Neil as well as squeaking keyboards and acoustic six-strings galore. This song is known as being the only one from this album not to have been performed live. And then finally \\"Cygnus X-1\\", which deals with the story which is so evident in the lyrics, informing us about a black hole in the constellation of Cygnus; the unknown hero travels to Cygnus in a ship called \\"Rocinante\\", and finally ends with him getting sucked into the hole. When I heard the sequel on \\"Hemispheres\\", it turned out to be quite different than what I had expected.<br />\\"A Farewell To Kings\\" is also known for being the first album to be recorded outside of their native Canada, this time resorting to Rockfield Studios in the pastoral countryside of Monmouth in Wales. \\"Hemispheres\\" was also recorded here.<br />This is quite an excellent album in which the band gets to further their showcase musical abilities, which was nothing new at that time. Many other bands in the late 70s had begun experimenting with synthesizers in general, and Rush quickly picked up on that ideal. In contrast to their earlier albums, which feature more edgy, guitar-oriented songs, \\"A Farewell To Kings\\" has indeed opened up a new chapter in their history and has paved the way for further albums like \\"Permanent Waves\\" and \\"Moving Pictures\\". This, I think, could be called the \\"golden period\\" when they were alternating between guitar and synthesizer dominance, and following \\"Exit... Stage Left\\" the synthesizer took on a more leading role, much to the disillusionment of Alex Lifeson.<br />P.S. I accidentally bought this one on LP and I knew it was a cautious mistake. I still have the LP version, although I much prefer to have it on CD, which I alsodo have. Anyway, I was quite impressed when I first heard this one, and it really blew me away when I heard them break into unchartered musical territory, which was a quite significant achievement for such a young and powerful trio. Nevertheless, it has proved itself to be a sequel to the success of \\"2112\\"!
B000063UR2|5.0|Yes Legend is definetally a movie to buy. This DVD has both American and Directors Cut version of the film. I personally enjoy the sountrack with  tangerine dream better. The other music score from jerry goldsmith is a little too snow white lousiness for me. But overall great DVD good special features buy it.
B00005YW4H|3.0|After hearing Don't Know Why, I had to hear more from Nora. But I am disappointed. The first 5 songs on the album are good, but after that the album just goes on and on and on, each song blending into the next and if it wasn't for silence between songs you wouldn't know when one song ends and the next begins. If you want a challenge, try listening to the whole CD without pressing the skip button.
B00006RIO7|5.0|The movie was amazing, definitely one of the year's best, and the soundtrack is no different.  I bought this soundtrack the first night that I saw the movie.  I just couldn't get &quot;All That Jazz&quot; and the other numbers out of my head.  It was definitely worth the investment.  It hasn't left my CD player for weeks.  The stars of this show are amazingly talented.  I didn't realize that so many movie stars could still sing and dance, but the group in this film definitely could.  I was blown away by their performances on the screen and on the soundtrack.  Please do not miss the opportunity to enjoy this movie and its music.  I promise that you will not regret it.
B00004Z459|5.0|this is a great album i recommend it and reanimation (did i spell that right?) they have good altenitive rck soundishness and stuff.
B000002A3T|5.0|Great album, really.<BR>One of the best Pink Floyd albums, with great lyrics, great guitar parts and a wonderful sound.<BR>I think Pink Floyd reached a point in wich all sounds great... all the instruments work togheter, creating a wonderful atmosphere.<BR>David Gilmour (guitar) plays maybe his best in this album.<BR>Song By song:<br />1. Cluster One: great introduction. It creates a great atmosphere for the next songs.<BR>2. What Do You Want From Me: A great song, really strong.<BR>3. Poles Apart: A good song with an excellent guitar solo.<BR>4. Marooned: Maybe one of the best floyd songs. It won the Grammy for &quot;Best Rock Instrumental&quot;. A crying guitar, wonderfully played (really difficult to play) with a great piano.<BR>5. A Great Day For Freedom: A wonderful sad song. The guitar solo is full of feelings.<BR>6. Wearing The Inside Out: Another Wonderful sad song with an amazing guitar solo. Wright's voice here is really great.<BR>7. Take It Back: A simple song... not at the level of the album. But it has its own strenght too.<BR>8. Coming Back To Life: Wonderfully singed, with a great atmosphere and two amazing guitar solos.<BR>9. Keep Talking: well.. a great modern song. Kind of Techno, but subtle. A great Bass part by Guy Pratt and a perfect sound quality.<BR>10. Lost For Words: An emotive song. With a wonderful acoustic guitar solo... maybe one of the best i've heard. It's a great introduction to the next song: the wonderful...<BR>11. High Hopes: Absolutely brilliant. A perfect ending for an almost perfect album. All in this song is just as it has to be. All the instruments, the voices, the orchestra and (of course) the guitar solos: a Spanish one and the Ending slide guitar solo, really really emotive.
6305696071|5.0|I've seen this movie about a million times!! Every time I see it gets better and better. It's like a book you just can't put down. Being 13, I've been watching this movie since I was young. Instead of watching disney movies, I was watching Pretty Woman. Most of the movie I didn't understand, but now as I'm older I do. I think this movie is a classic! Whoever made this movie aught to be very proud of themselves! Julia Roberts and Richard Gere were phenominal in this movie. I think's better than any movie I've ever seen! This movie is without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time! By watching this movie it has inspired me to want to become an actress. I hope I will be as successful as Julie Roberts!
B00005JKZT|5.0|I think that Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers surpassed the first movie.  Legolas is such a great character.  He befriends Gimli, a drawf who hates him. In this movie they become great friends. I can't wait for next movie.
B00004Z459|1.0|Remember those &quot;wonderful&quot; ballads from the mid eighties? by kiss, heart and styx? like tame, placid rock smothered in layer upon layer of stinking, cheesy synth, like twinkies deep-fried in animal fats? like a once pretty girl who turned fat, then resorted to drowning herself in layer upon layer of sickening, clotted makeup? Then you'll be glad to know lin&quot;coln&quot; park have ushered a renaissance in stinking, slow, monolithic, ugly, emotionally cliched, tired, trite stodgy ballads. and they don't even have a fretless bass, or female singer. shame on them.
B0000025DR|5.0|Fire On High is an incredible song by itself, but as it flows you into the rest of the disk, you realize that every song on here is great.  Definitely an album you want to hear in its entirety to fully appreciate.
0790749815|5.0|I like to preface this review with one thing: I hate horror movies. 9 times out of ten they are cheesy (and not as in cheesy &quot;that's what we are going for&quot; but cheesy &quot;we don't want that, it's a serious movie&quot;) and the 1 fails to live up to today's audiences. So, it's good Hitchcock is not a horror director. Just a supense man with horror elements. In what maybe his best American movie (and yes, better than Vertigo and rear Window), Hitchcock uses his arsenal of trademarks (an exciting score for Hermann, romance, spy thriller motifs, and exotic locales) to assembly the best man who knows too much (or little) movie. A essentail Hitchcok film.
B000066NW0|5.0|I'm not kidding, every track on this CD is amazing. Best debut album ever, wait, best ALBUM ever. Avril is the greatest, alot of her songs are deep and then there's some fun, catchy ones. She has a very good sound pop to rock to punk. Get this album!
0156012197|4.0|There is a reason some books are classics and The Little Prince is a great example of such a book.  It's told in a manner that make you feel as if you're reading a diary.  The illustrations meld perfectly with the story.  The story itself is imaginative and can be read on many different levels.  There is something here for all readers.  And that to me the measure of a true classic.  A book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds.<br />This small unasumming book hides a wealth of discovery.
B000001IPL|5.0|Simply the best CD from a great band.
B0000214F0|1.0|Caligula started out as a good script by Gore Vidal (he went to court to have his name removed once he saw the result). Guccione hired an art deco designer, some great actors, a director who couldn't speak English, and some of the best looking naked bodies around to film this mess. Guccione focuses on the evils of Caligula and portrays them exfcessively, graphically, and disgustingly. He ignores all of Vidal's lessons about politics, the evils of power being concentrated in one hand, etc. The result is creepy, sick, an anti-aphrodisiac.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is perhaps the most extraordinary book I have never read.  The horrors of her death are almost palpable, the reader's desire for justice is a constant undercurrent while reading this novel, but through it all, a belief in an afterlife is a steady theme.  Susie watching her family deal with her death is at times humorous and at times so touching you cry; Susie wants to much for things to be right on \\"Earth,\\" that she spends time in \\"her heaven\\" guiding her family before she can take that final step to \\"Heaven,\\" before she can let go.  I particularly liked Susie's words about Ruth:  \\"How she had fashioned the idea that a spirit could be a sort of second skin for someone, a protective layer somehow.  How maybe if she was assiduous she could feel us both.\\"  Susie's story from \\"her heaven\\" as she journeys toward \\"Heaven\\" is inspiring, it is a testament to faith, it's about reunion in a better place that waits for us.  This might be a difficult book for non-believers, but for those who believe, it is an incredible journey.
0871137380|5.0|This book had me laughing on one page than crying on the next.  It had me stand up salute the flag and cry &quot;God Bless America&quot; and than a few pages later wonder what in the world we were doing there in the first place.  This book is quite possibly my favorite book of all time.  For the true story of the Battle of Mogadishu (The Day of the Rangers) and Operation Restore Hope this is it.  I think Mark Bowden does a good job of stating the facts and not placing the blame on former president Bill Clinton.  (Hey I might hate the guy but Somalia really wasn't his fault.)  I've recommended this book to all my friends and two of them also think it to be a great book.  One thing that stands out is the difference in training, attitude, and ability between the Mountain Division troops, the Rangers, and Delta Force and other Commandoes.  The vastly superior quality of Commando units, such as the D-boys, SEALs, and Paramedics was clearly evident.  Still the rangers did very well considering they were made up of a lot of 19-21 year olds.
B00004STPT|5.0|This is a soundtrack that has impressed me greatly and which I would listen to several times a day while I worked. The themes were not necessarily unique - I can hear Sigfried's Funeral March from Wagner, Holtz's Mars from the Planets, lovely Celtic music, Spanish guitar work, and much more. Each fits perfectly into its location. The Roman empire was huge, encompassing a quarter of the known population of the entire Earth. The music moves from location to location - from the military machine that was the Roman Army in the depths of Germania, across to the middle east, and back into Rome itself.  <br />You take that journey through the music - the strength and honor of the Roman soldiers, the code of the gladiators, the love, the deception. There are common themes running through the music, and yet each piece represents and entirely different slice of the world that was the Roman Empire. There are other similar soundtracks that I've loved - those to Excalibur and Conan the Barbarian come to mind - but in those cases they often just lifted classical works known for their power. In this case Zimmer created entirely new works which pay homage to those classics but bring them to a new level, tailoring them to fit within the pathway of the movie. <br />There's even a second CD you can get if you want more of the music, but this one is a definite must-have. You don't get familiar with the tunes as you replay them. Instead, you find even more nuance, even more meaning in the songs you thought at first were 'less good'. I consider this a masterpiece up with my favorite classical music CDs.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|If you never own another soundtrack besides 8 Mile, than it don't matter. This is it. The movie was aiight, Em can't act, but muzik... WOW! He pulls out all the stops and gets a bunch of his boyz together to put together a worth wile album. Obie Trice is hot on a few tracks, but 50 Cent is where it's at here. \\"Wansta\\" is a killer track, but you should already know that. Shady lights it up on \\"Loose Yourself\\", but my favorite Shady-tune, is \\"Rabbit Run\\". X-to-the-Z put out another heavy beat with \\"Spitshine\\" - lyrics like \\"Fight the good fight, don't need no help; Keep your hands up, defend yo self\\", man I just wanna fight ya'll. <br />Eminem is where the rap world is right now, good things follow him, and this is no exception. Don't be cheap, get this album.
B000088E6D|5.0|This CD is really great!  From the first song to the last.  I heard about this CD on a TV/magazine show and couldn't wait to purchase it.   It's in my car and I haven't listened to the radio or another CD in weeks!
0345440927|5.0|If more people followed these positive techniques with their babies, today's classrooms would not be full of sooooo many impulsive and unstructured children. Parenting has changed over the years and many have moved away from sensible parenting. It is society and the children who will suffer. Too bad more people don't parent in a sensible way.
B00008HCCF|2.0|Norah Jones is an amazing artist. Her songs are lyrically beautiful and the way she sings them stuns me every time I listen to her CD. That said, I was disappointed when I watched her DVD, Live in New Orleans. Her perfomance was relaxed and laid back, something that I have come to expect from her, but it just seemed too structured. I was hoping to get more of a feel for Norah's personality but all I got was a replay of her CD. She did very little in terms of jamming, which is a staple in jazz/blues. The songs seemed like they were staight off the sheet music. Any group of musicians could have pulled off the same performance. There were brief moments when I thought she might come out of her shell more but I was disappointed there as well. In contrast, I recently bought John Mayer's DVD, Any Given Thursday, and his quirky personality and humor shone through. I was hoping for a similar showing from Norah. Honestly, I think you can get the same appreciation for Norah's music and artistry from her CD. The 4 added songs were nice and definitely well done but probably not enough for me to actually buy the DVD, if I had it all to do over again. If you already have the CD, you might as well just listen to it again. If you don't have the CD, go out and buy it, it is worth all the accolades and praise heaped on it. The DVD, unforunately, is just not worth the extra [$$] or the hour that you spend watching it.
B000002IHV|3.0|I liked the album \\"Out of the Cellar\\" a lot so I figured I would give this album a shot. I had heard the song \\"Lay It Down\\" on the internet and it intrigued me so I decided to get this album. The album has the traditional Hair Metal style but pretty much every song on here is about love. With no variety in topic the album seems kind of lame. \\"What You Give Is What You Get\\" and \\"Lay It Down\\" are the stand out songs on this album. Not bad to listen to at all, but you could have a better time listening to \\"Out of the Cellar.\\"
B00002ZMNV|4.0|Mixing the sacred and the profane, Metallica perform some of their best (and worst) with the 104-piece San Fransisco Symphony Orchestra. Certain songs, like &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;, &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot;, &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot;, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, and &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot; improve vastly with the extra textures that the orchestra adds, giving the songs more depth, and in some cases, balls-to-the-wall power. Others, like &quot;Sad But True&quot; and &quot;Fuel&quot;, make you wonder why the hell they were included in the first place.<br />Sound production on this is perfect and second-to-none. It's incredible to be able to hear the orchestra and the world's loudest rock band mesh together so well on some songs. Camera/visual work is impressive as well. Turn the lights out and watch this on a big TV screen with the sound turned way up. Guaranteed to make the neighbours move. Especially with &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot; blasting out.
B000002ILH|2.0|I'm the biggest Hair Metal fan but I just can't get into this album. A few songs like &quot;When the Children Cry&quot; and &quot;Lady of the Valley&quot; sound alright but overall the album just doesn't cut it. All of the songs on here are pretty much just ballads and there are no real moments of heavy guitars or heavy vocals. It isn't bad, but when you want something heavy this is not the cure for it.
0679411585|5.0|This is one of the excellent book that tells us about a major battle that took place in Vietnam during the large and dangerous WAR. That many people would like to forget about. Col. Moore does a very good job paying tribute to whoever fought under him at the battle of Ia Drang and those men will be heroes forever. Let the people who fought in that hot sweaty jungle for weeks at time be remembered as heroes fighting for the U.S.A.<br /> This book represents how no American soldier can ever give up. On October 23 to November 26, 1965 450 U.S. soldiers found themselves surrounded by a force of Veit Cong who fought hard and unscarred of death that would be waiting for them. Both sides went in looking for a battle and came out with the first major battle of The Vietnam WAR. Harold Moore commanded the men of the 1st battalion 7th Cavalry sent his men into the heart of Ia Drang. They didn't know that soon they would be surrounded by 2,000 Vietnam soldiers. Neither side predicted major losses but they both came up wrong. As many men died in the tall grass of that hot landing zone. The only lifeline that the Americans had was there supplies kept coming in from helicopter. These pilots were fearless when bringing in supplies because they knew that if they stopped there fellow soldiers would stop to. So they showed much courage flying into a Bees nest but instead of Bees flying around it was masses of bullets. <br /> There are many heroes in this battle, and even happiness in some parts, but this is a story of courage and the unwillingly of Americans to give up and the fearless Vietnam soldiers who were not scared of anything the Americans shoot at them. Many soldier's said \\"They would come out of nowhere in the hundreds and it was like shooting into a solid wall of soldiers.\\" Or others would say \\"No matter how many bullets you shot they would still keep coming not just from straight but all sides it was like the bullets did not hurt them.\\"     <br /> If you are looking for abook of excitement or just plain set on the seat of chair action. This is the book that is right for you. We would probally not have this book right now if it wasn't for the courage of all the men that fought in that jungle of sweat and blood and all the men that never gave up no matter what condition. Also Joseph L. Galloway and his courage brought this story here today.
B000059WOD|5.0|All I can say is that these guys have combined it all. Melody, rap, rock, lyrics, and the list can go on and on. If you want to listen to something that will give you the energy, or something that you can put in your cd player when everything else is overplayed, these guys will take care of that. Every song on this CD is of absolute quality, including the bonus tracks. One of the most positive items regarding this album is that they do not swear, therefor, you do not have to worry about your children getting any thoughts or ideas in their head, and blame it on the music. This group is about as real as you can get, and have a good point to their music. It is not just about coming up with what goes well, but have a theme to each track. I highly recommend this album, to all. I have parents who like to listen to them, and they are a primary listener to Classic Rock. A++++++ all the way.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I don't normally purchase DVDs until I have at least viewed them once. Since I have heard nothing but good about Donnie Darko I thought I would give it a try.<br />This movie was very hard to sit through. The plot was retarded. I was kind of skeptical about the plot anyway since on the back of the box it mentions something about Donnie Darko hallucinating and seeing a walking talking bunny rabbit.<br />Donnie Darko did not keep my interest, however I did reluctantly watch the entire movie- only out of curiousity to see how much more stupid the movie could get.<br />I don't have a clue on how this movie got so many five star reviews. I read them and now I feel that I was mislead.<br />Donnie Darko is garbage and this movie will probably make it to the bargain bin at the video store.
6301959957|4.0|This movie is wonderfully exciting, accurately portraying the boredom of waiting followed by the excitement of combat. Every specific incident that is shown happening to the Memphis Belle on her 25th and final flight actually happened, but not to the Memphis Belle. During all of her 25 missions, although the Belle received considerable battle damage, there was only one casualty in all 25 flights combined. That occurred to the tail gunner who was so slightly injured that the Belle's captain, Bob Morgan, had to order him to accept the Purple Heart. To get the accurate picture of the Memphis Belle, please read &quot;The Man Who Flew the Memphis Belle,&quot; written by it's pilot, Robert Morgan, with Ron Powers (ISBN 0-451-20594-4). Otherwise, for those who want a visual concept of the dynamics of daytime bombing by the 8th Air Force over German occupied targets, this film is an absolute must-see.
B000008H1U|3.0|The first time I heard Tull was on MTV's \\"New Video Hour\\" back in 1987. The music video for \\"Steel Monkey\\" played. Normally, I would not have paid much attention but my favorite band at the time, Iron Maiden, named Tull as a major influence in numerous articles I read. So I recorded the video. It had an almost country rock sound which was very different from what I was used to hearing. I was a heavy metal fan. Still, I liked it and went out and bought Crest of a Knave, my first Jethro Tull studio album. It was the first of many Tull records I would buy so it definitely sparked a new musical interest in me. I'll always have a soft spot for it and was very happy Jethro Tull won the hard rock grammy. Now that I've listened to all of Tull's previous studio releases many times through the last 15 years, Crest of a Knave is towards the bottom of my top Tull list. It's not a bad album by any means. It is a soothing album at times with tracks like \\"Farm on the Freeway,\\" \\"She Said She Was a Dancer,\\" and \\"Budapest.\\" A lot of the songs are about loss, whether it be a way of life or an intriguing woman. There is some sadness to this album. There is also two references to Jack the Ripper which might make a great Tull trivia question. My favorite track is \\"Raising Steam\\" which is, in contrast, a fun rocker. The single \\"Steel Monkey\\" is, lyrically, very clever. It gets three stars because Tull's earlier releases were so amazing. They raised the bar. As much as I liked this album in 1987, I found better music when I \\"discovered\\" earlier Tull albums one by one (a very fun time for me). Unlike most Tull fans, I wish Ian Anderson continued in the direction of \\"A\\" and \\"Under Wraps\\" (a more interesting and innovative path) rather than towards the more country rock sound of the late 1980s early 1990s. Note for those like me living in the vinyl and cassette past: this CD has two more tracks: \\"Waking Edge\\" and \\"Dogs in the Midwinter\\" (I've always thought 7 tracks was a bit skimpy).
B000000645|5.0|--nothing at all like the journey this one will take you on. Well, maybe WEE TAM/BIG HUGE. Surely a gift from the gods.
B00005K3OT|5.0|A very enjoyable movie with great atmosphere. The acting skills of Juliet Binoche are excellent and the supporting role played by Judi Dench really makes the movie and highlights the contrasts between the characters as the film develops. Johnny Depp is as handsome as ever and the soundtrack is wonderful.The contrast between small town ignorance and worldly wise experience is well portrayed and its really nice to see the characters blossom into real human beings and start enjoying life.I loved the little town in which the movie was set.A really enjoyable movie experience.
B00008K7AM|4.0|Although it had funny jokes, I think it was weird when Jessica (in the guy's body) had to go to the bathroom in the club-it was sort of gross. The dredlock dude that Adam Sandler played was funny but stupid and weird all at the same time. It's kind of confousing unless you've seen the movie. The pillow fight was really funny. It showed you how good Jessica's life was when they went to the mall.(She's the most popular girl in school, has the cutest boyfriend, is really pretty, is head of the school's cheerleading squad, ect.) Although this movie was weird, it was really funny. Although it could've been funnier, I liked it. See it if you're a Rob Shneider fan.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie absolutely blew me away when I saw it at the cinema. I went again the next night for a second round.It was exciting, with a mind boggling plot which I found disturbing and not beyond the realms of possibility.The special effects were some of the best I have ever seen. The sound track was dynamic, the casting excellent. I hope the sequel will be as good.I would call this one a classic movie in its genre.
0590259385|5.0|This book is great!  So far, my favorite in my child's collection.  The rhymes are fun to read and the illustrations by Steven Kellogg are amazingly cute.  I plan on buying more books by the same artist.
0671027344|5.0|what i really enjoy about the perks of being a wallflower is that, yes it is a diary of a teenager growing up and going through hardships, but it is much deeper than all other \\"diaries\\" i have read so far. <br />it might help that the main character, charlie, is a boy, or at least that he has real problems other than not having a significant other or being popular in school. he isn't popular, nor does he try to be. he tries to find his own place. charlie is honest, smart, sincere, and open with his feelings. readers can relate to the character, yet the events are not typical.<br />i highly recommend this book *my favorite book* to anyone who wants to read a truly honest and meaningful story.
B000066NW0|5.0|I totally agree with everyone but that Mr Gospel dude.  Avril is my favorite musician, and all her songs are great.  I especially like Sk8er Boi and Complicated. Losing Grip &amp; Uwanted are also good.  She is a punk rocker and a tomboy, and totally likes to stand out and be different.  I like this kind of attitude, and I like this CD.
630521610X|5.0|...then you'll love this movie. Have you ever seen a scary movie that is actually scary, has a sizzling cast and an \\"Oh my god\\" who dunnit - showdown in the last few years? Scream is an absolute diabolical terrifying movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first second to the last scream.<br />It starts pretty easy with a fabulous Drew Barrymore who receives an anonymos phone call and she thinks he's out for a flirt but what he really wants is to play a deadly \\"who wants to be a victim\\" quiz and when you play this quiz, you don't have a fifty-fifty joker.<br />Now after the terrible murders have been committed at the edge of Woodsboro, a peaceful town (or so it used to be) in sunny California, the police thinks that they are related with the brutal death of Maureen Prescott, mother of Sidney Prescott, which happend nearly a whole year ago. Maybe they aren't so wrong. One day later Sidney is attacked, and everyone suspects that it's her boyfriend who pops up the second she has been attacked. But when he's in jail, she receives another phone call. Now everyone is a suspect and everyone could be a victim. <br />For Sidney's protection her friends organize a party where the three rules of surviving a horror movie are confronted with every party guest:<BR>1. You can never have sex.<BR>2. You can never drink or do drugs.<BR>3. And never ever under any cirumstances say \\"I'll be right back\\"...because you won't be! <br />With these words the killing spree has begun, after all tomorrow is Maurren Prescotts \\"one year death anniversary\\". And the killer will do anything to have Sidney dead on that day!<br />Filled with loads of shocks, great acting, a stunning music score, a slam bang showdown, an original screenplay, a sensational opening sequence, and a great \\"who dunnit\\" ending, this movie gets a full five stars! (Would have been six)<BR>Buy this movie...Today! And prepare for the ultimate in terror.
B00008OOZ9|5.0|I enjoyed this album. I think it was very well put together. The White Stripes add a little flavour to some songs on the LP with a (WHAT!?!??!) bass. I particularly enjoy 'Little Acorns', 'In The Cold, Cold Night'(inwhich Meg White sings to a blues influenced riff and blistering bass), and the last track featuring a british vixon ripping up the notes along with Jack White in the duet 'It's true that we love one another.' Overall, this record is an improvement from the critically acclaimed \\"White Blood Cells,\\" and combines the old White Stripes style with a lot of blues influence.<br />Pick the up when it comes out, worth your cash.
B00008977N|2.0|At the risk of being very unpopular (given the previous reviews of this video), I can only give the \\"Secret World\\" DVD two stars.  Before detailing the reasons for that rating, let me say that I love Peter Gabriel's music - the deep spirituality conveyed in his songs and the intensity in which he delivers each musical offering are beautiful every time I see him perform.  Also, he is such a beautifully unique visual performer - the movement he seemingly improvises to the music as he performs reminds me of a cross between Twila Tharpe and Bob Fosse (as done by an aging guy with the beginnings of a paunch :~)<BR>Now for the critique...<BR>Knowing the exacting technical standards P.G. has brought to his music videos and recordings, I find it hard to believe he would have approved the technical production of this recording.  In regards to the audio, I can't believe I listened to the same disc as previous reviewers (althought this review refers to the DD5.1 mix, not the DTS). It sounds almost like AM radio - muted highs, muffled lows, and the vocal mix is WAY in the back of the 5.1 soundstage.  I finally had to crank up the center channel to adequately hear his and Paula Cole's vocals.  And, the post-production studio-added musical bits were NOT seemless - they stood out like a sore thumb, sometimes relegated arbitrarily to the surround speakers, sometimes panned around.  The added vocals sounded like they were done in a cheap basement studio and then rather ham-handedly thrown into the mix. Even the levels were off, sometimes hugely - several times my wife and I jumped as a chorus of tinny, disembodied voices shouted at us from the rear.  On some tracks, the sense of \\"additional music\\" added in post-production to the live mix was so overwhelming that I felt that I was watching a video with a different CD providing the audio.  Also disconcerting was the use of pre-recorded rhythm tracks.  I realize that the sound P.G. was aiming for would have made for a very complicatedlive mix and would have required more musicians and staging, but sometimes the pre-recorded tracks (or maybe they were midi loops from the keyboards?) completely overwhelmed the competent (I think?) drumming by Manu Katche...  All in all, not engaging or enveloping, but claustrophobic and disjointed.  <BR>As for the video portion, the film stock that the DVD was transfered from was grainy, washed out in color, and with terrible shadow detail.  You would have thought this was footage from a late 70's concert rather than shot in 1994. The grain and video noise in the picture was distracting, and the washed out color palette rendered what looked to be a wonderful lighting design pretty impotent - Either hot whites or murky grays.  I will say that the camera shots and coverage, in fact the entire visual concept of the show were beautiful and creative. Too bad about the lousy capture of both audio and video.<BR>That being said...if you can fight your way through the poor audio and video, Peter Gabriel himself is a revelation to watch.  Each song is a psalm of praise or discovery- pure poetry that transcends the banal and the earthbound.
B00005221L|5.0|Simply one of the best Action/Suspense/Monster Movies in the last 20 years.  I put it with T2 and Aliens on my favorites list. In my opinion this is what shot Ahhhhnold into the stratosphere. <br />The Action.  The shoot um up big guns explosions are done well.  My favorite is the the Mini Gun that is carried by Painless (for a while) The sound and fire power of that thing!!! Oh Baby, you just knew if he drew a bead on what ever it was that it would be done for! NOT! You have to watch this with surround sound and a decent system to appreciate this movie even more. <br />The Suspense. The suspense for me was The Jungle it self. Some Bad Bush! Not being able to see well and have something aside from the things that are already there that you can't see stalking you is even more scary.  <br />The Monster.  Man, an alien space hunter with overwhelming technology and vast inteligence not just a mindless monster killing on instinct.  Big, Ugly, Powerful, and Smart. Everything a monster could be!  Mixed up with a pretty good story although a little bit predictable (we all know the government will get you if they can) and pretty good actors it is no wonder that if this came out today it would still be a hit...
B000002JPA|4.0|I won't lie, this CD blazes with amazing skill and talent; mastery of all instruments played, songwriting is great, composition amazing. In theory, this CD should draw the istener in, drive him to a state of nirvana, kick his arse, and spit him back out, but it doesn't for some strange reason. While all the instruments are near perfect, the songs just don't stick to your head and haunt you for weeks. While I do admit that Pull Me under is one of the most awesome songs... well, ever, the rest of the CD, though good, is just not as memorable as I was thinking it would be. Regardless, I still like this CD a lot, and maybe I just need to listen to it heavily to have other songs be more recognisable. <br />Anyway:<BR>Pull Me Under 10/10, Best song, awesome opener, though it seems unfinished, dunno why they didn't make an ending to it... Pull Me Under 2, maybe?<BR>Another Day 8/10 slower song at the beginning, doesn't pick up much, pretty good despite being right after Pull Me Under<BR>Take the Time- 9/10 this is another good song, with a really nice beginning to it, the vocals shine here, reminds me of Freddy Mercury!<BR>Surrounded 8.5/10 the piano parts are somewhat annoying, but the begining has somewhat of a anthemic feel.<BR>Metropolis, Pt1 8/10 not as Memorable as the title suggests, it would probably be better heard with Pt2 in the las album<BR>Under a glass Moon 8/10 Watch out for the drumming here, it's insanely good<BR>Wait for Sleep 6/10 short song , just piano and vocals<BR>Learning to Live 9/10 I like that in this album the opener and closer deliver the smashiest punches, instead of having the best song always being just the first like it's becoming popular with other bands.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|BEAUTY AND THE BEAST     (USA - 1991)    Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track Dolby Stereo    To save her father from a fate worse than death, an unfulfilled country girl (voiced by Broadway star Paige O'Hara) agrees to be imprisoned inside an enchanted castle where the furniture is made up of living, breathing characters and the master of the house (Robby Benson) has been condemned by a witch to live in the form of a monstrous Beast. Only love can lift the curse...    Sheer cinematic joy! Produced in the wake of Disney's smash-hit THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) and helmed by debut animation directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST combines animated spectacle with vivid characterizations and exuberant musical numbers in a confection which ranks alongside the very finest classics of Disney's 'golden age'.     Returning to the European folk tales which had inspired many of their earlier animated features (SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, PINOCCHIO, etc.), scenarist Linda Woolverton leavens the essential romantic core of the film with exciting set-pieces and well-judged comic relief, and there are several stand-out sequences, designed and executed with breathtaking flair: A terrifying battle between the Beast and a pack of wolves, the spectacular and life-affirming 'Be Our Guest' number (voiced with remarkable dexterity by Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury), and the climactic assault on the castle, all of which are guaranteed to impress audiences young and old. Sadly, the film is dedicated to the memory of co-songwriter Howard Ashman, who passed away shortly before the movie opened in 1991.    PS. A musical number cut from the narrative was restored for a subsequent IMAX version, and the entire film will be reworked in 3-D for its 2010 re-release.    PSS. The movie was subsequently adapted - to great acclaim - for the Broadway stage, only to be sullied by an unnecessary TV series and a number of video-only sequels. Stick with the original.
B00008HCCF|4.0|Norah Jones may not have the keyboard proficiency of Dianna Krall nor the polished vocal range of Sade but she has what the others don't have - eight Grammys. Whether the Grammy was a one-hit-wonder glitch or a confirmation of her talents is a moot issue.<br />What is obvious in this New Orleans performance is her artistry -- no embellishments, just simplicity and grace. Norah exudes femininity which is sometimes hard to convey in a jazz setting; her voice, oftentimes soulful and melancholic, comes across intimately in Lonestar, Bessie Smith, The Painter Song and the surprise encore Tennessee Waltz. Her now familiar \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Come Away with Me\\", performed live, are enough reasons for having this DVD.<br />In the musical world where artistic integrity are often compromised, it is nice to have for more than a 'brief shining moment' a lone star like Norah Jones.
B000001FB3|5.0|only 1 studio album with bonnet,but the best album rainbow ever put out,bonnets style is in a class of his own,the harsh yet distinct vocal style is awesome,blackmores riffs are perfect for every song,memorable rythms,precise leads with his signature tone,and the backbone is intense,as powell and glover prove once again they are among the best force in hard rock.a must have rainbow cd.my first copy was vinyl,i saw this version of rainbow live with blue oyster cult at memorial aud.in buffalo they were fantastic...........
B00004XONN|5.0|This albums great and whist some of my friends sing their disapppointment towards the album, saying none of the tarcks compare to the first, I think it's a good atmospheric set of tracks. I'm happy to see a band like Radiohead experimenting with electronically generated sounds and I can safely say it's benifitted them here. Track one (what's it called again) with those lovely warm bass tones, they melt my soul. Admittedly the rest of the albums tracks don't hold the same listenability, as a whole it's a lovely dreamy listen.
B00004SYWZ|1.0|I like a-ha, but after listening to this album, I'm not surprised they're not around in the States.  Not as good as everyone hear claims. Morten's voice is off key, at certain points. There are few, if any hooks on the entire album. I bought this album based on these reviews. I learned my lesson. I'll download a couple of tunes next time before I commit.

B00004RF97|5.0|The film opens with Tracy Lord throwing C. K. Dexter Haven out of the house, breaking one of his golf clubs over her knee in the process. He responds by putting his hand on her face and pushing her over. This is a superb opening scene and if you don't want to keep watching after that I'd be surprised! Two years later, it is the eve of Tracy's wedding to George Kittredge, a self made man and wannabe politician. <BR>Enter ex-husband Dexter who agrees to help Sidney Kidd, editor of Spy Magazine, introduce two reporters into the high society wedding. Kidd has otherwise threatened to expose Tracy's father's dalliance with an exotic dancer. The two reporters are Macaulay Connor (Mike), a writer who thinks the upper class are all worthless; and Liz Imbrie the photographer, who is in love with Mike. <BR>Tracy has apparently divorced Dexter because of his drinking. \\"I thought it was for life but the nice judge gave me a full pardon\\", she says in one of their fiery exchanges. However, throughout the film we are shown Tracy as a very aloof and cold person. Dexter says that she is generous to a fault, \\"except to other people's faults\\" and it emerges that this failing is the real reason for the divorce. <BR>That night Tracy, who usually never drinks, starts on the champagne as if it were going out of fashion. Mike, who has also had too much to drink, ends up going for a swim with Tracy at which point the alcohol really hits her. He carries her back to the house where they are met by Dexter and George in the early hours of the morning. Needless to say, George immediately thinks the worst. So does Tracy the next morning when she wakes with an enormous hangover and no memory of the previous night's events. <BR>However, Mike eventually reveals to George that the affair consisted only of \\"two kisses and a rather light swim\\". \\"Why, was I so unattractive?\\" bridles Tracy. Tracy decides not to marry George, because he has assumed that she has had an affair with Mike. The Wedding March starts as the groom exits stage left. What happens next? Well, let's just say, there's still a happy ending! <BR>This film is a joy to watch, the dialogue is magic, especially between Dexter and Tracy. The acting is spot on, Cary excels as the suave, debonair and unruffled Dexter, Hepburn is perfect as the ice goddess who melts into a human being and Jimmy Stewart's drunk is hilarious.

B000056HE9|5.0|Plot:  Dudley is an angel who comes to help a bishop, in answer to the Bishop's prayer for help in getting funds for his new cathedral. The bishop is beginning to lose faith and believes his marriage is failing. Dudley restores his faith, and brings happiness back to the marriage, but the new church remains unbuilt.<br />Cary Grant and Loretta Young starred in two films: BORN TO BE BAD in 1934 and thirteen years later, THE BISHOP'S WIFE. This picture was nominated for Best Picture in 1947, but lost to GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. This is Cary Grant's 51st film and his second in 1947. THE BISHOP'S WIFE was remade into THE PREACHER'S WIFE in 1996, starring Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston. <br />THE BISHOP'S WIFE is the story of Julia Brougham and Henry Brougham, played by Loretta Young and David Niven, respectfully. Henry, plays an Episcopalian bishop, who is all caught up with building a new cathedral for his church and has forgotten about his wife, Julia. Henry wishes that he could have some help with the financing his project and prays to God for assistance. <br />In comes Dudley, Cary Grant, an angel, who has been sent to honor his wishes. Dudley then decides he will work for Henry as his assistant, but in reality decides to spend a lot of time with Julia to make her happy, which infuriates Henry. <br />However, in the end, Dudley disappears forever from their lives after accomplishing all he came to do. It turns out that an old rare coin given to Julia by Professor Wutheridge, Monty Woolley, is worth a fortune and the new cathedral can be built after all. Julia and Henry get back together and are much happier because Dudley has shown them the way. <br />Cary Grant has an awful lot of talent in this movie. With his acrobatic ability, he relearned how to ice skate; his musical ability lead him to play the harp, and this of course was not one of his funny films. This was a serious role for Cary and it turned out very well. Variety review of November 19, 1947, states, \\"Cary Grant is the angel of the piece and has never appeared to greater advantage.\\"

6303421563|5.0|I caught this film on cable the other night and decided to watch it because it featured a terrific cast. How can one resist a movie featuring sexy Frenchman Jean Reno, the beautiful Natalie Portman in one of her earliest roles, Gary Oldman, and Danny Aiello?<br /><br />The film centers around the relationship that develops between a beautiful and precocious twelve year old girl, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), and an Italian hit man named Leon (Jean Reno). Mathilda and her family live in the same run down building as Leon and are, in fact, neighbors.<br /><br />It seems that  Mathilda's dad (Michael Badalucco) has run into a problem with rogue Federal Drug Enforcement Agent  Stansfield (Gary Oldman) over some missing cocaine. When Stansfield and his crew gets into a shootout with dear old Dad in the family  apartment, wiping out her family, Mathilda alone survives. When Stansfield realizes, however, that there were three children in the family and only two are accounted for among the dead, he knows that he has to hunt her down before she denounces him for what he is, a cold blooded, killer cop.<br /><br />Mathilda turns to Leon for help in her rather precarious situation. Of the two, Leon and Mathilda, it is hard to decide who is the more innocent. Leon gets his hit contracts through an intermediary, a wise guy named Tony (Danny Aiello). Tony always assures Leon that he is holding all his earnings for him, as Leon cannot read and write. Leon is your quintessential killer with a heart of gold. Mathilda, on the other hand, though still a child, is a pretty wily little miss with nerves of steel. It would be difficult to pull the wool over her eyes. Together, however,  Leon and Mathilda go on a voyage of discovery, as each finds in the other something that captures the heart.<br /><br />Notwithstanding  this, the film is very much an action film. It is a rip roaring journey, as Leon and Mathilda try to evade Stansfield, the killer cop with no heart and a drug habit that would kill off lesser humans. Some of the situations are absolutely ingenious and a total trip. There is enough action in this film to satisfy even the most jaded of thrill seekers. Luc Besson, the director, has turned out a top notch, first class thriller.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is luminous as Mathilda, a kid from the school of hard knocks. Her beauty, as well as her acting talent, is evident even at this early stage of her development, and there are a few almost uncomfortable Lolita-like moments in the film. There is even a scene somewhat reminiscent of the rose petal scene in the film \\"American Beauty\\", sans the rose petals.<br /><br />Oldman is positively chilling with his almost over the top, edgy, manic performance. Danny Aiello is terrific as Tony, the smooth talking mob guy whom the viewer knows is taking advantage of Leon's simplicity and trust, enriching himself in the process.<br /><br />Jean Reno, however, will  melt your heart, becoming an almost mythic, romantic hero. I have to wonder why this amazing, sexy actor never made it really big in the United States. He is sensational as the killer with a heart. He also has some high voltage action scenes in this highly stylized film that will take your breath away.<br /><br />An uncut international version of this film with an additional twenty four minutes of footage has recently been released on DVD. It is listed on my Amazon wish list where I hope my children will find it and take a hint. It is definitely a film worth adding to one's personal collection. Bravo!ld kill off lesser humans.

B00005NGZX|5.0|This album is most definitely the best metalcore album I've ever had the pleasure of beating myself up to.  For all of you hardcore fans looking for something more intense than the likes of From Autumn To Ashes and Poison The Well (although I do like both of those bands) this is it. From the first track you know what you're in for.  Concubine opens and just kicks your [butt].  It's fast, insane and it's over so quickly that you don't have time to put your head back on straight before it's slow and godlessly heavy climax.  It's beautiful. Other than that, the title track \\"Jane Doe\\" is easily the best track on the album.  It's long, but in no way boring.  If you don't stay interested in this song for it's entirety, you're not a hardcore fan...
6303920713|1.0|They should have called this movie, 'The Great White Hope'.  It has a good premise, but every character is a stereotype and the end messege is that the African Americans and Hispanic heathens of the inner cities need a white teacher to come and teach their children cause they are incapable of teaching and positively parenting their children themselves.  I'm sorry, but I found this movie preachy and bigoted to the extreme.  ...
B00007ELEL|5.0|With amazing dialogue reflecting everyday life and the sometimes extrodinary aspects of normal life this movie is great. Its not for the movie goer who is searching for a real thought provoking movie but is an excellent use of two hours, unless of course you have something more useful to do than watch tv, this film is just plain awesome, but of course it isnt for everyone...
B0000683DH|2.0|I know that this is a very popular entry in the Star Trek movie series and that it did well at the box office, better than the original movie anyway but I found this one slow and monotonous. It dragged on and on and I couldn't wait until it ended.Paramount re-released this sci-fi dog again as a Director's Edition and at a lower price. I haven't even looked at the extras on disc 2 yet because the movie just turned me off.MY friend paid for this as part of a Christmas present and I am glad that I didn't waste my money on it. It is only good if you want to own it as part of the Star Trek movies set.<BR>The story is basically the sequel and conclusion to the Star Trek Original Series episode Space Seed which is one of the best episodes of the series.<BR>Khan, is very angry at Kirk for having been banished to a planet where it is no secret that survival would be very hard. Kirk could have had him punished possibly worse for Khan taking over his ship and attempting to make mutineers out of the Enterprise's crew.<BR>Star Trek 1 and 2 are boring, Trek 3 is a slight improvement, 4 is great, 5 is average but better than 2 and part 6 is great.<BR>I give this DVD two stars. 1 for the movie and 1 for the extra features disc.<BR>Summary:Stick with Space Seed unless you are dying to know what happened to Khan.
B000001IPP|5.0|This is the first punk cd i ever listened to. And is still one of my favorites. I think Tim and Lars are two of the best punk rockers in music. Every song is catchy and fast...a great combo.<BR>Matts bass is literally mind numbing! The only problem i had was they didnt use Lars' vocals as much as they should have. O well tim was still great. Rancid Rocks!
0312305060|5.0|I'm a conservative, straight, ususally vote republican kind of guy, so let's get that out of the way.  But I do make attempts at wrting poetry from time to time, and some of my work has actually been appreciated by friends and family, and I've become less inhibited about this, and here's where I'm going with this reivew.  If you've ever loved poems for the beauty that can be conveyed in capturing a moment, buy this book.  I enjoyed the movie, immediately purchased the book and it is completely deserving of the Pulitzer Prize and all of the rave reviews due to the fact that this is some of the most lovely prose that has been written in a very long time, in my humble opinion.  The plot is easy to follow, the characters are interesting, but the strength of this book is in the poetic images that are presented for the reader to contemplate.  It is easy to read, completely accessible - the reader will find that this short novel is well worth the few hours that will leave the reader wanting to know more about Virginia Woolf, if nothing else (I went to library and found that there are multiple volumes of her journals that have been published).  I guess the reason I identified with the characters in the book is that as an aspiring poet and painter I related to the desire and the process of creating.  And I think Stephen King was correct in his Memoirs (on Writing) that many, if not most of us could be/should be writers/poets or painters or whatever you are inspired to be.  Life is short and precious - don't be afraid to be creative, and this book could be an inspiration for just about anyone who wants to &quot;capture a moment.&quot;
B000001IQH|5.0|Rancid goes back to their old school roots in Out come the Wovles. Very strong follow up to Let's go, Wolve's seems to be a little better crafted than Lets go. Alot of Reggea Ska influences in this album. Rancid seems to get better and better with each cd and more musicly diverse. The fact that Rancid turned down every major record label that offered them a contract is amazing! They stayed true to epitaph records and didnt sell out. I think the one problem with this cd is the length...kinda long songs. A few stand outs are timebomb and Journey to the end.
B00005B36H|3.0|I was really excited about this album like alot of others when it first came out but after lIstening to every song forwards to back i have realized that this album didnt have the same feel that the other albums had it lacked alot of the soul maybe from over production or intense anxiety attacks were hitting the members of tool since its been a good amount of time since the last time we heard something new from these artist if i was going to narrow down this album to a simple statement i would say lateralus was a tag line for the previous albums being a very dedicated fan of tool for years i was very surprised to even find parabola on the album although it is a good song its just not the same tool that people came to love parabola was almost structured to be a pop math rock song if you like tool dont be surprised by thinking this album had the same intensity as a greatest hits album if tool is still new to you look into their previous efforts to understand tools progressive style and their musical art
B000001FI7|5.0|Great beats, but more laid back and more sultry. It is a cool album to ...dance to and works for whatever mood one may be in...Love her voice, and the originality of this group!
B000002IWQ|5.0|When I first heard C'parts upon its release, it made me shout \\"Yeeeessssss!\\" (a la Butthead).  While I never thought \\"It's about time they played something that didn't suck!\\", clearly Rush had nailed that something that wasn't quite there in the Presto/RTB period.  Think of it is as all the tunefulness of the 80s fused with the riffs of the 70s, yet not simply deriving from either period, or jumping on the grunge bandwagon.<BR>   In terms of holding a concept all the way through, I argue this is their best album to date; T4E and VT are close behind.  'Counterparts' implies duality:  two people in a relationship (Animate, The Speed of Love, Between Sun and Moon), two friends(Nobody's Hero), being of two minds (Double Agent, Stick it Out, Cold Fire)...every cut is strong and Neil's lyrics are personal and involved (unlike, say, Power Windows or RTB), and Geddy is downright soulful.  You can't help but sing along while blasting this disc in your car.  Cold Fire always makes me laugh because Neil seems to be evoking the thoughts of some poor shmuck who thought falling in love would be so blissful, only to find out he's the one wrapped around someone else's finger.<BR>  There are other dualities; musically, there's the war between Alex's riffs and Geddy's melodies...and the impact is devastating.  Alex positively blazes here; the entire album is a guitar seminar.  Neil would later describe how frustrated he felt about his drumming on this album, and when you listen to T4E in comparison(post-Freddie Gruber lessons), you do get the sense he was trying too hard in places...but far be it from us mere mortals to chastise.<BR>  10 years later, I still never feel like I've listened to C'parts too many times...it always makes me break out the air drum kit.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|About three people recommended this movie to me when it came out, but I only just saw it, and it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The movie is told from two boys' point of view; first, there's Will, a lazy, self-centered 38-year-old man who \\"does nothing\\" except live off the revenue from a hit Christmas song his father wrote. Then there's Marcus, an unusual 12-year old boy who's the outcast at school and who's only family is his depressed mother.<br />When Will decides that single mothers are the perfect people to date, he goes to a SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) meeting and pretends to have a 2-year-old son. This results in a date with one of the single moms from the group, but after their first date - where they're babysitting Marcus - they find Marcus's mom attempting to commit suicide. Although she lives, it scares Marcus to think that she might try to kill herself again. Marcus decides that two isn't enough (you need backup), and tries to set up his mom and Will. This doesn't work at all, but Marcus ends up coming over to Will's house every day after school. His mom isn't happy when she finds out, but can see that Will is important to Marcus, so their unusual relationship continues to grow.<br />Then after Christmas (which Will unwillingly spends at Marcus's) both boys develope crushes. Marcus falls for the bad girl at school, Ellie, with her dreds and nose ring, and although they are complete opposites, she excepts him as a friend so the rest of the school does as well. Then Will meets an interesting woman, Rachel, at a New Year's Eve party, and is forced to admit that he's \\"taking time off from taking time off.\\" The only thing he can think to do to keep from loosing Rachel is pretend that he has a son again, only this time Marcus is forced to play the part. Other than Rachel's son Ali being a little troubled about his mom dating, everything seems to be going well, although Will realizes that the whole lieing thing isn't exactly good idea, but he doesn't want to give up Rachel.<br />Meanwhile, Marcus's mom seems to be losing it again, and he's desparate to find a way to make her happy. Although he's warned by Ellie that \\"it's suicide\\" and he'll be teased by everyone again, Marcus signs up to sing in a show at school, because his mom told him that her heart was filled with joy when he sang. Of course I'm not going to tell you what happens, but I will say that this there's a great ending (it's actually my favorite part). I would recommend About a Boy to anyone who can appreciate a movie right on the edge between seriousness and humor.
0312305060|4.0|At first, when I read the book, I thought to myself, \\"nothing is happening\\" until I realized that a lot was going on.  For one, the author was mimicking Virginia Woolf's style wonderfully.  Not much action was going on, but lots was still going on.  I felt the book was about choices one makes when one feels trapped.  Virginia opted for death, rather than what she felt was mental (and physical) imprisonment.  Clarissa chose joy and relationship, Laura chose life instead of societal approval and Richard chose escape from living death.  It's not action packed, or especially easy to read, but once I got into it, I found I couldn't put it down.
B000001TVD|5.0|\\"Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time, cause y'all have knocked her up.  I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe...I was not offended, for I knew I had to rise above it all, or drown in my own s**t.\\"<br />Though this DEFINITELY makes no sense at all, it sets the scene for some more experimental, revolutionary music from George Clinton and Funkadelic.  Perhaps one of the darker albums of the early 1970s, Maggot Brain is a successful experiment and a tremendous success for Funkadelic's 3rd album.<br />Moving beyond the very freaky acid psychadelia of their first two albums, Funkadelic moved into a newer and eclectic sound; a mixture of harsh rock 'n' roll, psychadelic music, soul music, gospel choirs, and even more. Maggot Brain effectively managed to fuse all of these together.<br />The first song is worth the entire album, earning it the 5 star award: considered by many to be the greatest guitar solo ever, the late Eddie Hazel's \\"Maggot Brain\\" is a depressing, bluesy, acid trip that was recorded in one take. All it took was George Clinton telling Eddie to \\"play like your mother just died,\\" and Maggot Brain thus was born. The song opens with a dreary guitar backdrop and \\"echoing\\" drums that mysteriously fade out once Hazel gets into the solo; reportedly, this is because Clinton found that they \\"sucked\\" in comparison to Hazel's improvization. The song progressively gets more and more intense, until it peaks at the middle; but at the end it gets as intense as before. Unlike many other solos out there, Maggot Brain succeeds at having both an immsensely skillful player and the perfect instrumentation. Rarely, if not never, does P-Funk play a concert without Maggot Brain; it is one of their hallmark songs. If I haven't convinced you yet, the ten minutes of Maggot Brain are not worth missing AT ALL.<br />The next song, the happier and gospel \\"Can You Get to That,\\" is another great one. It serves almost as an \\"upper\\" from the depressing Maggot Brain, but is a fine song on its own.<br />Bernie Worrell's \\"Hit It and Quit It\\" features his expert keyboard skills, and---surprise surprise---another sublime guitar solo from Eddie Hazel in the middle.<br />\\"You and Your Folks\\" gave birth to the popular \\"yeah, yeah, yeah!\\" chant at Funkadelic concerts. While the song on the album itself is a little flat, the lyrics are wonderful. The song itself is a wonderful experience when played live.<br />\\"Super Stupid\\", a hardcore precursor of much heavy metal (in 1971!) is fun and ear-busting. Even if the lyrics aren't much, the instrumentation alone is worth the price of admission.<br />\\"Back in Our Minds\\" isn't much worth writing home about.<br />\\"Wars of Armageddon\\" closes the album, another masterpiece; but this one is designed to freak people out. Apparently Funkadelic got ahold of a sound effects tape, and went crazy with it; this song features a destructive guitar riff, and with the added sound effects you'd swear this song was the end of the world. Farts, laugh tracks, men and women screaming, etc...it sounds like the nation's fallen apart. And in 1971, still the race riot era, this did hold somewhat true.<br />Buy \\"Maggot Brain\\" immediately. Case closed.
B000003TAR|5.0|I've only had this cd a few days, but i have to call it the best cd ever. Beginning with the song \\"Serve the servants\\", a song about Kurts fame, to the final and hidden track \\"Gallons of rubbing alchohol flow through the strip\\" which is a song about rebelling against everyone. And why do amazon.com call this CD 'EXPLICIT LYRICS' when the only offensive songs on here are 'Rape Me' and 'Milk It'? This CD has been Nirvana's best effort ever since 'Bleach' in 1989, and i keep this cd in my classical CD archive.<BR>My personal favourites are: Serve The Servants, Heart Shaped Box, Rape Me, Francis Farmer, Dumb, Milk It, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter.<BR>This CD is the best album EVER.
B00006F7S4|5.0|What a whirlwind of emotions Beck has displayed. This album has touched me and has allowed me to relate completly with what Beck is conveying. It is the most perfect CD for bedtime, anytime, it is chill. Beck is so talented that he is able to change his style but still be able to keep a sense of himself in each of his CD's. While I am one who is not able to say a bad thing about any of his work, Sea change has proven to be one of my favorite discs. I highly recommend this to everyone, you will not be disapointed with what Beck has given to us.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Superman is, of course, the best, the sequels were so-so.  Considering it was filmed in 1977, the special effects are still stunning.  The DVD has been given the ultimate restoration in a way that makes the film seem brand new.  The picture is pristine, and the soundtrack - well, where do I begin with how brilliant it is?  The 5.1 remix sound has been carefully done to give the viewer an experience like no other. It's the first DVD older movie I have experienced with exceptional 5.1 sound.  Nothing can quite prepare you for how brilliant it is. Even if you don't really like the film, buy it because the sound effects will blow your mind.  Margot Kidder is great in this film, whereas she became annoying in the other Superman films.
0312305060|5.0|This is the reason people should read more often.  Michael Cunningham's words are like poetry, simple yet beautiful...and his story is a wonderfully intricate portrait of a day in the lives of three extraordinary women.  <br />The moment I read Virginia Woolf's legendary first line from Mrs. Dalloway, in the first line of The Hours, I knew I was in for an emotional roller coaster.  And that it was.  One can only see this book as a great piece of art; the words seep into your brain and paint a picture of life's simple wonders and heart-wrenching tragedies.  Life, love, mistakes and failure...things every man and woman can relate to...are in this book. <br />There are no words complimentary enough to describe the depth to which this novel will astound you, you simply have to read it for yourself.  I know I will; again and again.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is one of the best albums you will ever listen to.  When you put this into your CD player for the first time you won't take it out for weeks.  From top to bottom this CD just blows you away.
0486227073|5.0|It's amazing, I haven't even begun to read it, I've only copied the pictures, and I'm already doing much, much better! Obviously, I intend to read the book, since it would make my work even better. This is one of the best anatomy books I've ever looked at. Even though I haven't read it yet, it's indespible. Five stars.
B00005QB9A|5.0|This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. It was warm and sorrowful at the same time. I never cry at movies and if I do it is only a small tear, but this movie made me cry so much that I continued to sob even after it was over. You need a large tissue box for the ending of this movie! I was left with a sense of wholeness and joy, even though the ending was sad. I recommend you see this film and cry with the best of us. No movie has ever made me feel so alive and I love the fact that it moved me to tears. If you don't cry by the end of the film, then you did not understand the complexity of the characters. Tom Roth makes you feel his pain and his difficulty to be ordinary. The passion and simple pleasure he brings to the screen is one I haven't seen since I saw the English Patient. If a movie makes me sob like this one did, then I regard it as a miracle. By far, the best movie I have ever seen! Watch it and keep a kleenex at the ready. All I have left to say is WOW!!!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is the best animated film EVER! You'll never find a film so engaging and funny. Brilliant animations.This film is definitely a masterpiece, 5 stars....
B00005RFAI|5.0|I was a bit woozy of getting this album at first, but when I heard a sample of it, I decided I would get it and like it, no mattter what.<br />1:Missundaztood-For all you punk rockers out there, you'll probably diss this song because it's bubblegum pop mostly, but it really is a good song. She describes what she feels.9/10<br />2:Don't Let Me Get Me-This song is awesome. She's singing about some of the bad things in her life that she doesn't like, and instead of turning it into a boring ballad, she turns the song into a funky rock/pop tune. 10/10<br />3:Just Like A Pill-The chorous of this song made me get the album. It goes from slow, to a rockin beat, to a cheery tune for the choroous. Some of the words in this song don't make sense, but it's good otherwise. 10/10<br />4:Get The Party Started-Her first single, and I can see why.It would be perfect at a party, and it is very catchy.10/10<br />5:Respect-I think this song could come up with it's own music category. Kind of jazz, soul, rock, and pop at the same time. Will satisfy all your needs. 9/10<br />6:18 Wheeler-I love this song.Lyrics are kinda cheesy, but otherwise you will like this song. The music is genius, and this will get stuck in your head, no doubt about that.<br />7:Family Portrait-A very sad song. She's talking about how her mom and dad are in a fight and she's listening from her room. Again, very sad, but I love it. 10/10<br />8:Misery-Steven Tyler is the one who makes this song good. I don't exactly like the beat to it, because it's too old and jazzy for me. Good, though. 7.5/10<br />9:Dear Diary-The beat is very city style, and the words are describing her problems and how she's writing to her diary about them. 10/10<br />10:Eventually-Pretty slow song. I don't listen to it much, end of story. 5/10<br />11:Lonely Girl-For some reason this song is my favorite one off the album.If you don't feel a huge drop in your mood when you listen to this song, you must be a pretty sad person already. The wordsare great, abd the music is what makes it so sad. 10/10<br />12:Numb-I do not get this song, but it has a rap/pop vibe to it. The music is great if you need to do something extreme, or whatever. 10/10<br />13:Going To California-She's talking about how she wants to go to the city where she can start over again, and how she wants to go there. 7/10<br />14:My Vietnam-The lyrics are kind of corny, but it shows respect towards the soldiers. That's why I only bother listening to this song(sometimes)
B00004YZFR|2.0|Arguably the BEST period for the Stones and we get 3 or 4 songs and a HUGE amount of documentary. It's fine to watch it once, but wouldn't it be nice if they put out a DTS version of all the MUSIC??
B00000DR5I|3.0|This CD is definately meant for background music. It's not exactly captivating enough to leave you on the edge of your seat, leaned waaaay forward like it'd help you hear anything.<br />It's good, in its own respect, though. Something nice to chill out to, while reading, or working. Don't buy it if you're looking for truly involving music though.
B00006LJ72|1.0|This is the third time that Warner Music has tried to cash in on Enya's polularity by producing &quot;a Best of&quot; album: Box of Dreams, Paint the Sky with Stars and now; Only Time.<br />Enya has all in all release 17 B-side tracks (all of which were release as part of a soundtrack, a single or from one of the above best collections):<br />The Promise / Paint the sky with stars / Oriel window / Willow on the water / Only if... / 'S fagaim mo bhaile / Midnight blue / Song of the sandman (lullaby) / Isobella / The first of autumn / Morning glory / I may not awaken / Oiche chiun (Silent Night) / Anrion (Love song from LOTR) / May it be (Song from LOTR) /  Book of days (Love song from Far &amp; Away) / Only time (Remix)<br />If you wish to have these B-side tracks then i highly suggest hunting from her previous albums rather than buy this nicely done but extremely poorly developed collection.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|Very nicely done CD. Wonderful ambient/IDM style music- well worth the money. Been a proud owner of this CD for a while, now, and listen to it often, when I'm in the mood for this sort of music. Definately a worthy addition to anyone's IDM collection. Possibly even a 'standard' of any IDM collection. Aphex Twin knows how to do it, and do it RIGHT.
B00005ARDC|4.0|There are many moments during BRMC's debut album when you'd be forgiven for noticing a, er, similarity to the Jesus and Mary Chain. The boys can be excused, though, because they've taken the forgotten promise of mid-80's JAMC and pulled it screaming into the new century, filching an additional decade's worth of influential touchstones in the process and throwing their own sensibilities and talent into the resultant mess. But what a glorious mess. Bass-heavy grooves collide into crashing waves of distortion and feedback, piercing riffs collapse into folky strumming, and every song is lent a near mythic weight by the dramatic ebb and flow of Peter Hayes' baritone croon. By the end of this deeply textured, moody and ominous, yet always tuneful and accessible album, all those Jesus and Mary Chain comparisons start to sound a little cheap.
B00005RRG9|5.0|I had some tears going during the parent trap. Isnt that pathetic at the age of 23? haha.. its true<br />I actually had tears going when I was younger and I saw this movie. When I ordered it on DVD, I thought \\"there is no way Im still going to get emotional at this age\\". I was wrong. Althought the movie starts out a bit corny, you cant help but get into Haley Mills superb acting. Many things about this movie hit a soft spot. The long lost twins coming together by fate and finally finding out the truth about their past. The daughter who finally got to see her mother and grandfather after never seeing them. The parents finding out that they still love eachother and can't live without eachother after years of serparation. It touches you in a special way for sure, but at the same time its so much fun! As with most of Walt Disneys movies, everyone in this film was casted perfectly. Ya know, this movie still makes me laugh a bit too. One of my favorite little parts of the movie is when the girlfriends mother says \\"is this the one you call peanut face\\"? hahaa.. I remember how embarressing it was being called names like that when I was little.<br />Hayley Mills is really great and Im a true fan. The 2 disk DVD is excellent top notch quality! It has behind the scenes, commentary with Hayley Mills, a great classic donald duck cartoon and more! The DVD audio and picture quality is great and Disney studios put alot of care into this DVD. If your looking for a great movie for the kids that you can also enjoy, this is it!
B00005QY5Y|3.0|He's being sold as an alt.country saviour, a direct descendent of Gram Parsons, and a casual genius, but it's all smoke and mirrors. Don't get me wrong, he's a slick songwriter, all right, but he's closer to the old Brill Building ditty churners than the new Dylan. Much closer to the Eagles than Gram. His rock'n'roll recklessness is a studied pose, just like his hair is perfectly uncombed. An easy, safe listen from a true professional, but don't be fooled by the hype and come here looking for greatness.
B000060P79|5.0|This CD totally rocks! A perfect mix with a little popish-style punk, there are a bunch of songs worthy of being singles. Everyone knows &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot; and &quot;Addicted&quot; but there are some other really good songs. &quot;God Must Hate Me&quot; and &quot;You Don't Mean Anything&quot; are awesome. &quot;I'm Just a Kid&quot; and &quot;Worst Day Ever&quot; are some chill tunes.  I can completely relate to a bunch of the songs, especially &quot;God Must Hate Me&quot; and &quot;Worst Day Ever&quot;. Simple Plan rocks! Get this CD!
B00001OH7P|3.0|For some reason Ziggy Stardust is always referred to as a concept album. But let's track that plot for a second: the world's going to end in five years, so a starman becomes a rock star and then commits suicide. O-kay, Dave, that's a story with mythic resonance. So let's face facts. There's a reason this has never been made into a movie: it's a concept album lacking a unifying concept. There. The cat's out of the bag. Now let's move on, shall we?<br />Musically, this is an interesting album because it really demonstrates how much a strong instrumentalist can add to a song. David Bowie writes wimpy, Anthony Newley-esque showtunes - and this album is full of them - but Mick Ronson's guitar turns these slight throwaways into muscular rock anthems (of a sort). His guitar solo in Moonage Daydream makes it worth suffering through the song itself. If this album was just about Bowie and his melodramatic songcraft I'd give it maybe two stars and try to avoid ever hearing it again, but Ronson and the Spiders From Mars miraculously pull it out of the trashbin.
B000002WPI|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best albums found in hip-hop today. This is also the LP that inspired me to be a rapper. Some of the hardest and best metaphors can be found on this one CD. (I developed my style from this LP.) What I like about this CD is that every member of Wu has his well-deserved shine. All of these songs can be considered calssics. Wu-Tang has always been my favorite group. A group that has Method Man, GZA, RZA, Inspectah Deck & Ghostface Killah must be the greatest of all-time. A group that has these 5 lyricists AND produces hit after hit; hot album after hot album is definitly somewhat sacred. The top songs on this cut are C.R.E.A.M., Method Man, Can It All Be So Simple, Protect Ya Neck & Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin Ta [Mess] Wit. If you don't have this LP, then your life just isnt complete. Below is my track rating (1-5):<br />Track 1 - 5 <BR>Track 2 - 4.5<BR>Track 3 - 5<BR>Track 4 - 4.5<BR>Track 5 - 5<BR>Track 6 - 5<BR>Track 7 - 5<BR>Track 8 - 5+++<BR>Track 9 - 5+++<BR>Track 10 - 5+++<br />Track 11 - 5<BR>Track 12 - 4.5
B0000062GK|5.0|This cd is one of those cds where you never use the &quot;skip&quot; button.  They are all stellar songs.  A few songs are slow at times like &quot;Time&quot; but they all pick up eventually.  Worth every penny, honestly.  It is Joe's best cd yet because there are such diverse songs.  Buy it, now.
B00000GV55|5.0|I agree with the one reviewer in how many of us searched for music in the seventies. I think that Henry Cow is quite different though from the likes of Yes or Genesis. Henry Cow is not heavy with the mellotron, showcase guitars or flashy multi-keyboards. They use brass instraments too, which is not normal for a rock unit. The instramentalists are all exceptional and the band might be better served being compared to Oregon, Weather Report or Soft Machine (actually Soft Machine was more punctuated). Robert Wyatt was one of Henry Cow's influences, so it is right to draw this association. Henry Cow draws a lot of their unique sound from &quot;Electrified acoustic instraments&quot;. Nervana for Mice is a dynamite piece; the whole emsemble is showcased as a working avant-gaurd, compositional unit. I listened to them in the seventies, but they do not sound anything close to what one might associate, musically, with that decade. Art Rock I suppose, but not like Magma or Pink Floyd at all. Fantastic spin!
B00000ICN5|4.0|For those who know me, I listen to nothing but instrumental rock and despise country music.  The fact that SRV phased me enough to buy his cds should say somethin.
B00005RHGK|4.0|at the very beginning it is really scary some big ... truck is chasing these people right then it finaly leaves them alon but right after you see the guy(from a far distance so you cant tell what he looks like)dump a bodie into this big hole thing in the ground then the guy looks at em(its really scary at this time).after then get all their stuff trown onto the ground at a gas station sorta thing they get tailed by cops to make sure they get to thier destination in 1 piece.but the moster jumps on the cop car(you still dont know what he looks like)throws one cop out the window and the other he sticks his hand through the cars roof grabs his head chops it off the he gets his van and throws his body in there then he grabs the severed head and bites the tongue outta the body.after they get help at this old lady.they ask to use the phone but before they get into the house the old lady says \\"where did that scarcrow come from?\\"or something like that.at that time she grabs her shotgun ...  (you finally see the monster)it starts walking forward and kills the lady.but the end is [unsatisfactory] i have said enough i dont want to spoil this CREEPY movie.
B000089RVX|4.0|I first heard about this group when they were talked about for singing the theme song to WWE's No Way Out 2003. The theme song was &quot;Bring Me To Life,&quot; which was PERFECT for No Way Out. I knew I wanted this song, so I just got the entire album. &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; was spooky but exciting, particularly when you listen to the song right after watching &quot;The Ring.&quot; Gives you chills down your spine, but is throughly enjoyable. Liked all of the other songs, too. Can't wait to hear more from this group with tons of potential talent.
0449002632|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful book -- as enjoyable on my current fourth reading as it was on my first.  I do have one serious complaint, one which I am surprized others have not made.  Even though the characters and plot lines are totally original, the structure of the novel is all Michener.  I am very disappointed that Rutherford does not acknowldedge his debt to Michener in his introduction.
B00005JLSC|2.0|This is pretty good entertainment. I'll give it that.It's well put together, and has some catchy dialogue.The problem is, is that, none of the actors can sing or dance.I mean when you watch it at first, you think, wow they're amazing, but after time passes by, your amazement wears off, and you begin to see this film for what it really is-it's well-filmed.The shots are basically what make all the actors look like they're dancing.Even then I wasn't impressed.And Catherine Zeta Jones, who CAN sing and dance(relatively) is one of the film's weaknesess.She overacts wayyyyyy too much.I mean, I never thought of Jones as anything special, and this movie proves it.She's not able to perfectly capture the chracter, so she does what any mediocre actress would do-she overacts!!Richard Gere, now I've always disliked him as an actor.I have my reasons.I mean he's capable of giving a decent performance here and there, but I have always disliked him because he overacts,is trite, and brings no depth or poignancy to his characters.His singing in the movie bored me to death, and so did his dancing. It also felt that throughout the whole movie he was putting on one big show, and trying to impress everyone.Rene is a great young actress, but she cannot sing or dance, and I really don't care how much she tried.Now, I thought Latifah's singing was the best in the film.She also proved that big women can be sexy, and gave her cheesy chracter a somewhat new spin.John C. Reily.I like that guy.And his performance as the pitiful husband left behind was ok, but his singing was out of place.In the end, what we have here is a big budget film, with realy nothing to stake it's claim in.I wish they had chosen people who could sing and dance, and provide more range and depth to their chraccters, instead of trying too hard to please, and making it one big show.I'm sure that the musical is better than this.
1400034779|5.0|Precious Ramotswe is a comfortable size-22 African lady (none of your Euro/American size 6's for her, thank you very much) with a fund of mother-wit and a penchant for minding other people's business.  Having survived a disastrous, abusive marriage and the death of her infant son, she turns a small legacy from her late father, whom she adored, into \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\", the only one of its kind in Botswana, or maybe in all of Africa.  From shaky beginnings with non-paying clients and chauvinistic male attitudes (\\"Who ever heard of a woman detective?\\" demands a border policeman; \\"Haven't you ever heard of Agatha Christie?\\" Mma Ramotswe shoots back, not missing a beat), she builds up a small but solid clientele that brings her problems to solve concerning cheating husbands, wayward daughters, malingering employees trying to commit insurance fraud; and a spectacularly sinister case involving a missing eleven year old boy who may or may not have been murdered for witchcraft purposes.  Giving Mma Ramotswe quiet but ever-present moral support, while keeping her old car from falling apart, is Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, who loves every inch of Mma Ramotswe's ample frame and is patiently waiting for the brick wall of her resistance to marriage to crumble, so she can make him the happiest man on earth.<br />Smith has written an enchanting book that is can be described as a cross between an engaging detective story and a love poem to Africa.  Mma Ramotswe is as warm and as solid as the red earth of Botswana; she loves every inch of the Africa she knows and identifies with and wouldn't live anywhere else.  She embodies the African traits of deep ties to family and community, concern for one's neighbors, and respect for tradition.  She commands respect and she gets it.  Smith has added a delightful and enduring creation to the pantheon of famous detectives in fiction.  Jane Marple, move over.  Or rather, make a separate space for Mma Ramotswe.  She deserves a pedestal of her own.of her own.

B0000067L2|5.0|While many albums released in 1967 sound dated, including &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; it's refreshing to listen to Cream's best album, &quot;Disraeli Gears.&quot;  &quot;Disraeli Gears,&quot; along with Hendrix's &quot;Are You Experienced,&quot; are undoubtedly the two best albums released in 1967.  These albums set a high level of musical virtuosity in the rock marketplace- rarely equaled, and never surpassed, since that year.  They also drop-kicked rock music into the modern era.  What &quot;hard rock&quot; or &quot;heavy metal&quot; band can't trace its root back to these two masterpieces.<br />Sounding just as fresh today as when it was recorded, &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; is simply one of the best rock albums of all time.  It stretched the musical talents of Baker, Bruce, and Clapton beyond &quot;Fresh Cream.&quot;  It highlights the musical imagination of this short-lived band at its height- before burnout and acrimony destroyed them.
B0000542DG|5.0|Thrilling and different. Good slasher flick minus the slasher (as critics agree). Recommended. Score: 98/100
0790729601|2.0|I was debating whether to give Eraser two stars or three, but then I realized that giving it three would mean that I liked it more than I disliked it. It was something that I would say &quot;Eh&quot; about. There were some cool parts, and it was definitely packed with action, but it went completely overboard by the end. There was a surprise at the end that made the movie seem to be going somewhere, but then they ruined it again with another surprise that counteracted it. Arnold was invinsible as always, which I can accept and appreciate, but with all of the situations in Eraser, nobody is that invinsible. My interest faded through the second half of the film. Eraser was weak. It is something that mostly guys would enjoy, and kids would feel cool watching it, because of its nonstop action violence and its R rating, which only reflects the violence and some language. For a better Arnold role, watch Terminator 2, and don't pay attention to Eddie Furlong's bad acting. It is more believable that a terminator can be so invinsible!
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is definitely one of the best albums of 2002. I've always been a fan of these kind of 'rarities' albums, and Steal This Album is no exception. Lots of very powerful songs, but also with driving melodies and captivating lyrics. The singles, \\"Innervision\\" and \\"Boom!\\", are excellent selections, and if you've heard them, you'll probably agree. But, as always, the best tracks are never released on the radio (it's an effective psychological gimmick that I won't go into here); the real beauty lies on the CD, in songs like \\"Mr. Jack\\", \\"Roulette\\", \\"A.D.D. (American Dream Disorder)\\", and my personal favorite, \\"I-E-A-I-A-I-O\\", which I think is the world's best way to get a crowd riled up. This is a definite must-buy for music fans.
B000001Y5X|5.0|Manson has some of the best works out there he is a very talented man but this is the best cd he has realesed the lyrics a dark if u want them to be and the songs seem to have more of a meaning then in any of his later works i would pick up holywood if u like this album and i know if u get this album you will love it
B00005YW4H|5.0|What incredible CD! It hasn't left my player yet!!! Norah has such a great talent, no wonder she swept the Grammys. Anyone who's even thinking of buying this CD, do it!! You won't be disappointed!!!
0786868694|3.0|Like all cookbooks, success or failure depends entirely on the recipes contained therein. How to Be a Domestic Goddess was absolutely packed with foodstuffs I couldn't wait to tie on my apron and try but Nigella Bites is more miss than hit. It was nice to have full access to all the TV recipes without having to scramble for a pen and scrap paper whenever it came on E! but convenience isn't enought to justify the price tag. As always, the numerous photos are appreciated and let you know whether or not you've gone horribly awry in the cooking process but the many blank pages for 'notes' are a waste of space. No one who's just shelled out twenty-five dollars for a cookbook is going to deface it (Just take notes on bits of paper and tuck them into the appropriate pages like everyone else for heaven's sake, Nigella).<br />But these are niggling details in the grand scheme of things; whether or not you should buy this book hinges solely on what your eating urges are. Each section is a essentially a 'themed' meal- White Trash, Dinner for Two, Rainy Day Supper, etc- so altogether you only get about 8 different recipes for any given course. Looking for lots of appetizers? Tough. Want a wide variety of main courses? Too bad. Need to satisy your sweet tooth? Invest in 'Domestic Goddess' instead. This book is more your style if you want to try a little bit of everything: A Nigella sampler.<br />All told, despite being a rabid Nigella food fanatic, I only found about 6 recipes I really wanted to try and I've only gotten around to cooking two of them: Chocolate Pots and Mozzarella Carraviggio. They are both delicious but very rich; any more than one helping and you'll find yourself feeling sick. Mozzarella is the worst offender, being essentially a fried grilled cheese sandwich that sits very heavily in your stomach.<br />It's more than a little ironic that the book most directly tied into the show that made Nigella famous to American audiences is quite possibly her weakest effort.
0060012218|5.0|I'm a sophomore in a Jesuit high school(interestingly enough, it's the same one that the author attended), and I tend to steer clear of books written specifically for teens because they are often condescending. Nevertheless, I picked this one up after I met the author at a gay-straight alliance discussion group. For quite a while after I finished, I found it difficult to pull my thoughts from the mind of the book's narrator. It was provocative and well written. Alienation is, oddly, something that almost everyone goes through at some point in their lives- high school is known for that, and this book adeptly expresses those feelings. I would recommend this book to both gay and straight students. It is worth reading.
B000000I0I|5.0|This is one of those albums which lives up to the hype. I had gotten a scratchy copy of this on vinyl from the library in the 1970s then tried to buy a copy only to find it was out of print. Many years later, it finally showed up on CD. It was worth the wait. This is even better than I remember it. This is one of those rare special albums which you must experience and feel rather than merely listen to. It's really hard to describe in words, but I'll try with the advance warning that words fall far short. Imagine Jean-Michelle Jarre's synthesizer sound combined with incredible melodic electric guitar, bagpipes, and other folksy instruments performed with Celtic, African, and World influences. A series of seamlessly blended, ever-changing, ever-evolving beautiful melodies are woven together with the numerous intruments weaving in and out of the mix at various times, all building upon each other to create 2 grand symphonic suites. To descibe this as \\"new-agey\\" would be an insult as it in no way resembles the light-airey-soft-modern-jazz-soulless-elevator-music quality of most new age music. It's just great, timeless music which sounds as fresh, interesting, and exciting as it did almost 30 years ago when I was lucky enough to experience it for the first time.
B00006879E|4.0|A refreshing sound of funk infused rock with a slightly pop edge defines Maroon5. Their debut album, <I>Songs about Jane</I>, features heart-felt lyrics and distinct soul roots.<br />On \\"Harder to Breathe\\" Maroon5 kicks off the album and shines through with some funk roots mixed with a little pop. But on the next track, \\"This Love,\\" they are right back where they started, their funk and soul beginnings. Highlights on the album include the light hearted song \\"Sunday Morning,\\" the ever sexy \\"Secret\\" and, of course, the love-lorn \\"Sweetest Goodbye.\\"<br /><I>Songs about Jane</I> displays lead singer Adam Levine's lyrical artistry and talent for the infectious, as seen through \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and \\"Tangled.\\" The album features incredibly original sounds, despite the overplayed theme of love. Although, while listening to the album, it's easy to overlook this fact. Especially when \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\" leaves a sweet ending flavor to the album with you.<br />The main problem with the album: the effect of hearing them live is completely lost. Maroon5 manages to spellbind their audiences with ease and poise, which is often times a point shoved aside with this album.<br />Pick up this album at a store nearby. Once you hear their sound on <I>Songs about Jane</I>, they will have left an indelible mark on your mind.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is my first Johnny Cash cd. I have always admired the man from afar 'cause he lived hard, played hard, and worked hard. The man represents what country music should sound like, not the polished crossover pop sound that is flooding the pop market today. What compelled me to buy the fourth volume in the &quot;American&quot; series was Johnny's gorgeous rendition of the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Hurt&quot;. The sparse instrumentation and emotional vocals captivated me. Johnny quickly made that song into his own song. I got the chills when I first heard the man in black's cover of The Eagles' &quot;Desperado&quot;. I almost wanted to cry. That is just how good I found his interpretation of the classic Eagles' song, and I don't say that very often about any cover song. &quot;Desperado&quot; fits Johnny Cash like a glove. I found Johnny's version of Depeche Mode's &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; unusual yet incredible. Johnny Cash manages turns one of my favorite synth-pop songs into a rockin' rockabilly song. Another song that gave me the chills was the Hank Williams song &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;. Johnny's rich baritone voice adds so much depth to this classic country song. &quot;American IV: The Man Comes Around&quot; is simply an amazing album. This is one of those rare gems where the music is so good that it makes me want to cry. Johnny Cash has managed to reinvented himself as an interpreter of modern music. No one can touch the man in black.
B000000H66|5.0|What can I say about this album?  It's probably THE best death metal album ever made!!  The musicianship is unlike anything I've heard before for this genre of music.  The drummer, Gene Hoglan is absolutely fantastic and extremely creative in the way he provides drums for the album.  The guitar riffs and progressions are fresh and original, and every song has something catchy to offer.  I love every song on this album, but if I had to recommend a couple, I would say that \\"Symbolic\\" and \\"Crystal Mountain\\" are two of the best.  Pick this album up or you'll be denying yourself one of the best death metal listening experiences available!!
0676973779|2.0|I find that &quot;artistic intellectuals&quot; sometimes develop a fear of offending their peers and develop a group mentality towards mediocre literature. Fortunately I am not an artistic intellectual and can safely say without retribution that this is an okay book - but I have read a lot better! I gained no insight about myself or my world from this book.
0385504209|1.0|This book is blashpeme. The author writes lies about Jesus Christ the Son of God and Savior of all mankind. I would not recommend this book. Instead read the Bible to know the truth about Jesus.
B00005QTAR|5.0|We must be reaching the end, because Volume 39 of The Star Trek DVD series contians two of the last great episodes producedin the series three season run.<br />At first look THE SAVAGE CURTAIN may be considered a ridiculously silly episode.  This is the infamous episode where 'Abraham Lincoln' makes an appearance.  True that this episodes plot is way too far out to ever actually occur but still you have to give the writers credit for their creativity even if this is too cheesy.  Basically the story goes that the Enterprise crew are abducted by a friendly alien entity who takes the form of Lincoln.  Lincoln insists he is who he actually is and requests that Kirk and Spock accompany him to the molten planet where (unbeknowst to our heroes) the rock like aliens, the Excalbians have organized a battle between good and evil.  Pitting (good) Kirk, Spock, Lincoln and the greatest Vulcan philosopher Surak against (evil) Genghis Khan, Kahless the Unforgettable (founder of the Klingon Empire), Col.Green (someone who supposedly is a Tyrant in our future) and Zora (some fairly forgettable experimental witch tyrant here).  The story has essentially an anti-war message.  Some people consider this to be one of the worst episodes.  I actually greatly disagee with that thought on this show.  Of course it's nowhere near the best but it's effective and creative, especially considering that (by this time) the Star Trek series was on life support.  Not the best but good for third season standards.  Hey, at least they didn't credit Abraham Lincoln played by himself!<br />ALL OF OUR YESTERDAYS was the last great Star Trek episode to ever make it into production.  Being only an episode away from the end of the series' three year run, in retrospect they should have ended with this one.  The story essentially deals with time travel.  The Enterprise journeys to Sarpeidon and Kirk, Spock and McCoy meet a peculiar old librarian (played by Ian Wolfe).  It's a really effective time travle episodesince this story has three settings: Present day Sarpeidon, Kirk in Sarpeidon's Victorian age, Spock and McCoy in Sarpeidon's ice age.  The last setting really steals this episode.  Partly because we see Spock's barbaric nature take him over.  There is no doubt why Nimoy is on the front of the DVD case.  He even gets an effective love interest in this story (played by Mariette Hartley).  An interesting plot, great acting and a somewhat tragic ending make tihs episode one of the more memrable episodes from the tail end of the Star Trek series.<br />Overall this is another must.  One of the better pair of episodes from the end Star Trek's wildly uneven third season. Highly recommended.
0385504209|5.0|Bravo! Dan Brown has written a break out novel that deserves every word of praise that is being heaped upon it.<br />This is an exrtaordinary page turner.
B00006IU73|5.0|Porcupine Tree's newest album, \\"In Absentia\\" is certainly nothing short of brilliant.  This was actually my introduction to PT, but I've heard some of the older songs.  With this album, they've obviously taken a much heavier sound (but still manage to be pretty laid-back and mellow at times).  I can see comparisons to Radiohead and Pink Floyd at times, but the heavier sound is more similar to some of Dream Theater's heavier riffs.  <br />Steven Wilson, singer/guitarist/songwriter, is the main man in Porcupine Tree.  He wrote most of the music and the lyrics, and he has composed a masterpiece here.  The lead guitarist adds incredibly tasteful and beautiful solos to a number of the songs.  Gavin Harrison is an awesome drummer, and also extremely tasteful.  Steven Wilson's voice kinda reminds me of Mike Akerfeldt of Opeth's clean voice.  As a side note, he has produced the last two Opeth albums, which are also masterpieces, so check those out.  But back to \\"In Absentia\\"...<br />\\"Blackest Eyes\\" features heavy riffing mixed with acoustic guitars and chilling lyrics.  \\"Trains\\" is probably my personal favorite song, with some beautiful acoustic guitar and vocal arrangements, and an amazing chorus.  The guitar solos are also very good.  \\"Lips of Ashes\\" is truly a haunting song, with amazing vocal harmonies.  \\"Wedding Nails\\" is a dark and heavy instrumental.  \\"Prodigal\\" is particularly reminiscent of Radiohead.  \\"Heart Attack in a Layby\\" is absolutely beautiful, in a depressing way though.  This song is the most intense moment of the album, for me.  The album closer, \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth\\" gives a comforting feeling after a dark and somewhat scary album.<br />It's excellent that this came out just a few months ago, because that means great music does still exist.  Porcupine Tree are clearly one of the best progressive rock bands out today, and this album is not to be missed.  Their older stuff sounds awesome too, so check that out also.  I know I will.
B00003CXSM|5.0|Ok, I won't go into what the moie was baout because I think the other reviewers already did a great job of that, and I don't want to just repeat it.  I just adored this movie!  It was funny, and sweet.  I think it's a great gift for a bride-to-be.  I loved the ending, but I wish it didn't end where it did, I mean that I wish they would have shown more.  Overal a great movie, great date movie.
0793518326|4.0|This book is great--it has all of the guitar parts and bass and drums and even the orchestras!  The problems with the book, however, can get frustrating: the book is kind of big to put on a stand, the music is kind of small and hard to read from far away, there are a few mistakes in lyrics (not a whole lot, but a few), and many times they do not put in the differences in instrumentation between verses (for example, bass lines in the two verses of 'She Came In Through the Bathroom Window' are written as the same line).  But the up side of the book, having pretty much the exact transcription of every Beatles song, greatly outweighs the down sides.  This book is a great alternative to searching for hours on the internet for often unreliable guitar chords for Beatles songs.  Get it--you wont be disappointed.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is awesome.  With 13 wonderful, cleary, and catchy tracks with a pop/punk edge to it, its no wonder its been doing so well.  I first feel in love with Avril the summer of 2002 when I heard &quot;Complicated,&quot; her first single.  Her voice really spoke to me.  It was amazing.  She sings so wonderful.  Then when I saw her video, I fell in love with Avril herself.  She was so beautiful, but thats another story...hehe.  The catch &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; and &quot;I'm with You&quot; singles are some of my favorites!  And I cant wait for her new video/single to come out, &quot;Losing Grip&quot;  I'm a very big fan of this rocker chick, and the 18 year old sensation is a wonderful teen inspiration.  I recently got concert tickets for her first ever tour &quot;Try to shut me up.&quot;  I cant wait.  All of her songs rock.  Some are harder, while others are soft.  The one thing I love most about her CD, is that you can understand her lyrics as she sings, unlike other artists.  PLUS this CD comes with the &quot;Complicated&quot; music video with an bonus track when you pop it into your computer!  I love ya Avril!  Avril Rocks!  Rock on! \m/  This is one CD to add to your collection.  You wont be dissapointed.  And dont label her &quot;punk&quot; or &quot;skater.&quot; Even though its best not to label her, the best thing to label her is...&quot;Avril Lavigne.&quot;
B000089RVX|5.0|Never have I liked a band as much as Evanescence.  THIS CD IS GREAT!
B00004W510|5.0|What follows is a re-write of an earlier review of an OOP edition of this classic album:<br />As crucial and important as any work by the great American composers Virgil Thompson, Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein, these four Canadians and one Arkansas farm boy created a perfect piece of musical Americana. <br />Actually, for that matter, &quot;The Brown Album&quot; ranks right up there with John Steinbeck, Thomas Hart Benton, the films of John Ford and the plays of William Inge in terms of capturing North American mythology, legend and character. <br />Working succesfully like a collection of short stories, &quot;The Brown Album&quot; celebrates the rich tapestry that is the land, the people and the music of Canada and America fusing both cultures into one brilliant pot. Just like those two countries, the music is filled with heartache, rich optimism, adventure, passion, sentimentality, nostalgia (without resorting to maudlin posings), recklessness (just listen to Richard Manuel's drumming on &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot;!)and utter romance.<br />Levon Helm's voice rings through the ages like a finely aged and tempered oak cask holding a fine whiskey. Rick Danko and Richard Manuel with their respective fragile yet boyish desires lend depth and scope to the albums rich and epic sweep.<br />One the finest creations ever to come out of Rock Music, this album actually transcends the genre and, like the equally great Van Morrison work &quot;Moondance&quot;, probably is beyond labelling. <br />Along with the equally great &quot;Music From The Big Pink&quot;, The Band created with this work of art an unrealistic expectation that they admittedly never reached as consistently again in an entire album.<br />Although written in 1969, the music is timeless in the truest sense: it could have been written today as easily as one hundred and fifty years ago. All five original Band members were superb musicians and this work is a testament to that fact. There is not a false note or misstep to be heard on this work of art. An indespensable 10 out of 5!
0553103547|5.0|This book, while a little dull for the 1st few 100 pages, is amazing.  I loved it.  Better than any other Fantasy series out there.
0792107683|5.0|Shane is a movie with proven formulas that work for the western; good guys, bad guys, homesteaders, cattlemen who made the land suitable for homesteaders (not purposely) and want them gone and the gunfighter who's hired to put down this uprising of intruders.  And it's always great to see a bad guy (Ben Johnson) decide to become a good guy.  Westerns just don't have the latitude that other types of movies like dramas and mysteries do.  Life was simpler then, not easier, but simpler.  Compared to other westerns this rates high, especially when you consider when it was made.  Alan Ladd (Shane) is a likeable stranger who wants to leave his past behind but can't.  Compelled to go on using his guns, he doesn't want to stay in one place long.  You know there's going to be a showdown between Ladd and Palance at the end.  And Jean Arthur's abhorrence of firearms is a ridiculous.  Without them there wouldn't have been a homestead for them to go to in the first place.
B000002J20|4.0|If you want Yes to be a rock band, I think you'll be disappointed by their very souls.  This is not rock music.  This is music.  The scores for the pieces on this album, 4 20-minute giants, were writeen in 6 hours in one night from about 1AM to 7AM, &amp; they revised them over the next few months.  A lot of the music here is sort of ambient, slow, &amp; with some weird drumming &amp; other things too you never know where it'll take itself from anywhere.  There are all kinds of different musical experiments here, &amp; I don't think any of them have any desire to resemble rock.  This is the Yes album you want for the mystical uniqueness of the music.
0792101448|5.0|What better way to start a western than with a good showdown? These three gunfighters waiting for the train to arrive so they can gun down Charles Bronson are enough to make you want to cringe. I didn't put the whole story together the first time I saw it, some of it is obvious, like Bronson's obsession to pay back Fonda for killing his brother (\\"Keep your lovin' brother happy\\"). Henry Fonda's performance as a bad guy is quite convincing, a man with no conscience and no desire for one. Claudia Cardinale is so sexy she practically steals the show. I can't remember how Jason Robards fit in to it but I'm sure that somehow he does. Bronson (\\"Harmonica\\") is a constant irritation to Fonda (Frank). Something about him really bothers Fonda but he doesn't know why. Bronson's presence haunts Frank to the end, especially when he returns to Frank the harmonica given to him years ago.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I generally don't buy CDs having only heard one song, but i took a chance on this one, and it paid off! This has a diverse range of tracks, and i was pleasantly suprised. Its difficult to choose a favourite track, but ...(ie all the things she said is quite special, but 'Clowns (can u see me now)'is a dynamic fast pace that shifts between a fast piano/synth ditty to a slow sweet singing. Malchik Gay is also excellent, strummy guitar, harmonious singing and a really catchy chorus, the ingredients for a classic. 'How soon is now' is so far as i can tell the only cover on the album, but it surpasses the original by far, if uve seen 'charmed,' have the soundtrack to the 'wedding singer'or were a new romantic during the eighties, ul have heard the smith's classic. This version has the same melancholic feel, but a with large serving of attitude.   <br />This album is so good i bought two, one for house and car. I can't pick out a best or worst song, but this album caters for all tastes and moods, look ot for an extended version of 'Show me love' which is available on some special editions. Otherwise, if u liked 'All the things she said,' u'll love this- buy it now! If you didn't like 'All the things she said' i feel pity for ur lack of taste, take a chance- buy it any way!

Music lyrics may be [not so nice] but to point of entertainment, music is speech of angels - Not this one 'Eminem' It is more a speech of inner experience & thoughts. Rap is like a cup of tea, smooth with warmth and comfort or burn your tongue, leaving a taste of pain and sorrow in your mouth! Swearin' in terms of slang words symbolize one's emotions abused by those around them is all in rap saying and with Eminem, like a hard childhood, ... Music is fun, anways, Pick this one, if you like!
031286504X|5.0|Matheson's I Am Legend is one of my favorite books--one I've read over and over, and always find something new to cherish about it. This is a book I highly recommend. Not just becuase it is entertaining and well written, but I Am Legend is a staple of both the horror and science fiction genres. But it is more than that. It is also one of the finer Apocalyptic novels (or novellas) written. And I believe might even deserve a place (no matter how small) in the sub-genrea of Utopian fiction. Matheson does a wonderful job of helping us understand the horrors of the end of the world, being alone, and even the sympathetic side of being a vampire (all with almost no dialogue). It's a beautifully written book.
B00005JM3O|4.0|Luck can be passed to person to person, or sucked out of someone like a liquid.  Do you have what it takes to sustain your lucky streak?  When will it end?  The main characters put up all of their valuables, for the thrill of winning, and for claiming that they indeed do have the best luck in the moment.<br />Directed with a somnelent hand, the director takes us into a realm where bets are placed on fate.<br />The pace is at once odd and ethereal.  The viewer is thrusted into an underworld where the stakes are high, and the only the lucky survive, again and again.<br />There is a plot with elements of justice, love, risk, and redemption.  The denouement could have been longer, but the viewer is not lucky enough to see more.<br />Russian roulette with FIVE bullets is normal, especially when you are clad in all khaki in  a desert somewhere, in a ... survivor's casino.<br />The story is original.<br />The acting is first rate.<br />Like an oneiric gamble on life and death.
B000070WJE|5.0|The UK's biggest pop artist returns with his first album of original material since 2000's &quot;Sing When You're Winning.&quot;  Now, after selling and selling and SELLING copies of this latest release in his homeland, he's set his sights on American audiences once again, coming April 1st.  Will the latest trend in quirky, original, &quot;artists actually wrote it themselves&quot; music help Robbie finally gain airplay, Billboard success, and US respect?  We will have to see.  In the meantime, here's what the UK version of Escapology has to offer.  (NOTE:  The American CD track list is slightly different.)<BR>This album can be best-described as typical Robbie. It's his mixture of pop-driven songs that win over fans and highly opinionated tracks that might shock a first-time listener.  He uses a variety of sounds and different genres; from the bluesy piano/guitar concoction Feel to the catchy acoustic self-appreciation cut Handsome Man.  Also find a bit of disco (Hot Fudge), hard rock (Monsoon, Song 3, Cursed), mariachi (Me and My Monkey), grandiose Angels-esque choir style (Love Somebody), and simple unplugged (Nan's Song).  While there is obvious experimentation with instruments, each song's lyrical content is unmistakably Robbie: brash, true, and clever.  On the whole, the album is great.  The highlight song for me was Something Beautiful, a great addictive pick-me-up.<BR>Since &quot;Sing When..&quot;, it doesn't seem like Robbie has broken much new ground.  He has maintained remarkable consistency between these two albums.  His real test will be his next album.  Since parting ways with his right-hand-man composer Guy Chambers, he's got to prove that he can carry on and still churn out hits.  I hope this pressure works positively for him, pushing him to work hard to generate his best material ever.  Again, we will have to see.
B000084T18|5.0|What can I say,I absolutely love this album. It's 50's first album since getting a massive name for himself and the only way he got that was by signing on Shady/Aftermath Records.<br />1. Intro <BR>2. What Up Gangsta - A cool track with great production but way too short. 4/5<BR>3. Patiently Waiting (Featuring Eminem)- A nice song with Eminem producing...It's 50's version of \\"Lose Yourself\\". 4/5<BR>4. Many Men (Wish Death)- I love this song it's one of my favorites. 50's a good rapper and it shows on this track. 5/5<BR>5. In Da Club-2nd Single,good production by D.R.E. but 50 only spits 2 verses cool video. Better than \\"Wanksta\\".4/5<BR>6. High All The Time-Great song,with great production,and funny lyrics. 4.5/5<BR>7.Heat-A song as real as the streets.50 is a gangsta and it shows on this track. 3.5/5<BR>8. If I Can't-3rd single...nice beat from Dr. Dre 50 doesnt come off as good on this track. Can't wait to see a video. 3.5/5<BR>9. Bloodhound (Featuring Young Buck)-This a great song i love the barks and the beat. Young Buck is Str8 reppin UTP Playaz not G-Unit. 5/5<BR>10. Back Down (Ja Rule Diss)-Great song and Ja Rule deserves it hes stupid. Nice though...its a classic just like Bloodhound.5/5<BR>11. P.I.M.P.-Great song with even better production. 3.5/5<BR>12. Like My Style (Featuring Tony Yayo)-I like it but some people don't...but Tony Yayo should have spit a verse.<BR>13. Poor Lil'Rich-An older track with a facelift from some great production. I love this song. I love how he says Ni**a.4.5/5<BR>14. 21 Questions (Featuring Nate Dogg)-Would be a great choice for a 4th single. But again 50 only spits 2 verses. Nate Dogg does a great job on this one. 4/5<BR>15. Don't Push Me (Featuring Lloyd Banks & Eminem)-Better than Patiently Waiting but not by much. Straight up gangsta track with some aight production from Slim Shady.<BR>16. Gotta Make It To Heaven-Too much of the DJ talking but still a good track. Very fast paced.4.5/5<BR>17. Wanksta-1st Single-Also featured on the 8 Mile Soundtrack,In Da Club is better but not by much. Another Ja Rule diss.Bonus Track. 4/5<BR>18. U Not Like Me-Written right after 50 got shot 9 times. Good gangsta song.Another Bonus Cut. 4/5<BR>19. Life's On The Line-Another good song but the word murda is used a little too much. Still a good song. Truely the last song and the last bonus cut. 3/5<br />Check out the new G-Unit album due late in 03,A Lloyd Banks solo album also due late in 03, & a 50 Cent DVD/CD bue April 15,2003
B00005RY7X|4.0|well i must admit i bought this album because of the cover art.  it was above the techno section in a used cd shop, but when i first stuck it in i was severely disappointed, or more like puzzled.  however after several listens and several weeks i quite enjoy it.  <br />yes, it's pretty bubblegum, pretty simple, half of the songs sound like they're for commercials.  they all sound really similar, the whole album sounds like one long partying song.<br />but it's so shamelessly fun that its in a genre by itself.  i can finally understand how people liked 80's music.
B000069AUI|5.0|the first coldplay album is one of my favorite albums ever.  it's on my top 10 list (number 7).  so the 2nd album was a little disappointing, although every song is wonderful and i'm not disappointed at all.  it's just that the first album totally uncontrollably TAKES me.  so i was tempted to give this album a 4 out of 5, but it just wouldn't be fair, because the album is truly amazing.  so i guess i'd have to give it a 4.7 or so out of 5.  onto the songs..<br />1. Politik - this is actually my worst coldplay song.  of course, it's a wonderful song.<br />2. In My Place - this guy knows how to make something so simple sound so amazing<br />3. God Put A Smile Upon Your Face - neato little tune<br />4. The Scientist - i can't tell if these songs are written by a 7 year old or a complete genius, or perhaps a complete genius who is in touch with his inner child.  the songs are so simple, but so genius.<br />5. Clocks - what a lovely song.  deservingly all over the radio.  this song is where the album starts to wake up, but wait and it gets even better<br />6. Daylight - wow.  this song has feeling.  it's like he becomes the daylight<br />ok, songs 7 thru 10 are my favorite on the album.  it was actually 7 and 8 for a while, but then i heard 10 and decided that it might be the best song on the album.  and i didn't really know how great 9 was until pretty recently.<br />7. Green Eyes - for a while this was my favorite song on the album.  \\"green eyes, you were the one who i wanted to fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind!!!!\\"  it's just a damn lovable song.<BR>        <BR>8. Warning Sign -  this song, though.  wow.  this song goes places.  when he says \\"but the truth is, that i miss you!!\\".  wow!!  i believe him.  and i relate.  and it's awesome.<br />9. A Whisper - this song has a great flow through it that just takes me.  it's pretty much the only fast-ish song on the album<br />10. A Rush Of Blood To The Head - recently i was considering that this might be my favorite song on the album (for the longest time it was a time between \\"green eyes\\" and \\"warning sign\\").  i guess i can make it a 3-way tie (or 4-way tie, because i love \\"a whisper\\" so much too).  it's a mellow song, but it's got energy and power.  the only part of the album that almost touches what the entire first album does to me, when this song goes into, \\"and honey, all the movements your starting to make..\\".  wow.<br />11. Amsterdam - this is a great song, too.  one of my favorites when i was first listening to the album.  it builds up, and it's great.<br />anyway, this album has beautiful moments of its own, despite its differences from the masterpiece that the first album is.
B000009EAD|5.0|Iced Earth is probably the best band in the American thrash-power scene, and this album is probably what Modern Thrash should be defined with. It has speed, power, anger, sadness, and a trilogy about the Anti-Christ, what else could you possibly ask for? <br />The album starts off with: <BR>Burning Times (9.5/10), an awesome and heavy song, going into the calmer Melancholy (9/10), a song about Jesus, which reminds of &quot;Gethsemane&quot; from Jesus Christ Superstar. <BR>Next is Disciple of Lies (8/10), followed by the beautiful and saddening ballad Watching Over Me (10/10).<BR>Stand Alone (8.5), Consequences (9), and My Own Savior (10/10) are all hard hitting and angry. <BR>1776 is an awesome instrumental, the subsequent Blessed Are You (9.5) is one of the best.<BR>The album closes magnificently by the Something Wicked Trilogy, started with Prophecy (9), then the powerful Birth of the Wicked (9.5) highlighted by the 9-minute The Coming Curse (10).<br />All in all, this album should be in any Iced Earth and/or Thrash fan's library.
B00005AR3G|5.0|Kuzco is a spoiled ruler. He wants to build his pool on top of a hill which is home to a village.  Kuzco is turned into a Llamaa and he needs help to get the evil advisor who turned him into an animal.<br /> The story is told by Kuzco's point of view and you'll get the jist that he's spoiled and self-centered.  However, Kuzco does changes his mind about building his pool on the village at the end of the movie.
B00006690G|5.0|Wow....This is defintely one of my favorite cd's ever by Eminem & he topped his last 2 albums which is hard to do.<br />1. Curtains Up-An Intro mainly for 1st track but also the album.<BR>2. White America-Great track,very angry lyrics more...love the way he yells. 4/5<BR>3. Business-Very funny song,Marshall has a great flow on this track. 3.5/5<BR>4. Cleaning Out My Closet-2nd Single,all about his mom, this song is all about getting stuff of his chest. 4/5<BR>5. Squaredance-Really cool song....awesome hook and production.4/5<BR>6. The Kiss (Skit)-Intro to the next track<BR>7. Soldier-Very fast paced...another angry song 4.5/5<BR>8. Say Goodbye Hollywood-The hook is way too long but its still a good song 3/5<BR>9. Drips (Featuring Obie Trice)-Obie Trie spits a nasty verse & Em has a really nice hook. 3.5/5<BR>10. Without Me-1st Single,closely resembles \\"My Name Is\\" & \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" but still is a good song and cool video. 4/5<BR>11.Paul Rosenburg (Skit)-Ems manager telling him not to bring a gun to work anymore.<BR>12. Sing For The Moment-Wow I cant enough of this song, I love it.Em is awesome on this and I love how they Sample Aerosmiths \\"Dream On\\".Probaly my favorite. 5/5<BR>13. Superman (Featuring Dina Rae)-Great production and awesome hook.3rd single but the video is too hot for tv. 5/5<BR>14. Hailies Song-This just isnt Eminem at his best...not a bad track but hes done alot better. 3/5<BR>15. Steve Berman (Skit)Nothing special pretty funny though.<BR>16. When The Music Stops (Featuring D12)-Typical D12 track but Proof spits a nice verse & Bizarre comes through with an alway funny verse. 4/5<BR>17. Say What You Say (Featuring Dr. Dre)-Jermaine Dupri diss good track Dre shines on this one. Good production. 4/5<BR>18. Till I Collapse (Featuring Nate Dogg)-Poor production but Eminem & Nate save it. Closely resembles \\"Lose Yourself\\" off the 8 Mile Soundtrack.I like the remix better. 4.5/5<BR>19. My Dad's Gone Crazy (Featuring Hailie)-Very funny but not needed.3/5<BR>20. Curtain's Close -Outro with Ken Kaniff in it really funny.<br />Check out Eminem's The Sauce (Benzino Diss),Nail In The Coffin (Another Benzino Diss),& Stimulate (A cut song from The Eminem Show)
B00008AY3L|2.0|Too much from the past leaving nothing for the future.  The cd is overproduced and unoriginal.     <BR>The songwriting is amazing as usual.  If you are a disapionted fan check out upandcoming bands such as: Iron &amp; Wine, The Velvet Teen, Postcard Audio, Matt Pond PA.
B000089RVX|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I have had it in my player and on repeat since the day I bought it. There are so many great tracks to pick from it is hard to decide. Right now my favorites would have to be: Bring Me To Life (Duh?,) Tourniquet, My Immortal, and Hello! However, I have had the whole cd on burn not just thoes songs. I can't get enough. Buy this Cd you won't be sorry!!!!
B00003OO3O|5.0|UFO too often had trouble coming up with a complete album of great songs, but this is one where they hit the nail on the head. And it leaves you feeling like the nail. This is a wall-to-wall intense blast. Okay, there are a couple of ballads, and they're good ones. Michael Schenker's guitar playing veers from breathtakingly beautiful to insanely wild, and no other studio effort of theirs lets him cut loose so brilliantly. Members of Ten Years After handled the production and the keyboards, and they gave this disc exactly the sound it needed (another sore spot with too much of their work). The emotional lyrics throw wood on the fire, and the rhythm section knows when to be ferocious and when to lay back. The album closes with an achingly beautiful instrumental, which is necessary to cool you down after &quot;Too Much of Nothing&quot; has laid waste to you. Look at how many songs from this album went on &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, and you'll see where their good tracks are at. This album needs to be given the respect it deserves as one of the very best hard rock albums ever- I mean, EVER, recorded.
B00005J6T0|5.0|Being a teenager, adults think that all I listen to is rap but in reality I own not just rap albums but Madonna, Prince, Cyndi Lauper, Janet and Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston albums, albums that were popular when only I was a tiny thing. I find this Madonna album to be one of my favorites, one I even push Missy Elliot's aside (horror of horrors!). &quot;True Blue&quot; is 80's pop at it's best, I just love it. Madonna really sells the hit &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; with the screaming chorus and truthful words. &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; is a hard hitting track that is another one of my favorites. &quot;White Heat&quot; I really like besides the corny talking bit it's actully a well crafted song. My all-time fave Madonna song has to be &quot;Live To Tell&quot;. It is a beautiful song from start to finish, the music is incredible, the faraway keyboard mixing with the guitar (sorry if I'm gushing) but this song ROCKS! &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; is another favorite of mine. The chorus is real catchy. &quot;True Blue&quot;, &quot;Where's The Party&quot; and &quot;Love Makes The World Go 'Round&quot; are pretty sizeable, I listen to them as well but I think &quot;Jimmy, Jimmy&quot; is kinda &quot;Stupid, Stupid&quot;. This is an awesome album, one that should be in every music fan's collection. I recommend it, after all it is Madonna.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Who doesn't love this album?! It's awesome! I do admit that I only listen to about 9 of the songs on the entire CD,but they are so well done, that this album still deserves 5 stars.If you haven't heard &quot;The Beautiful people&quot; where have you been? If you are just starting out with Marilyn Manson, then please do yourself a favor and buy Mechanical Animals first, because every single song on that album with stick to you like super glue.They are truly one of the greatest bands out there,they're more than just loud guitars and screaming vocals( like lots of rock bands) they have catchy and intelligent lyrics as well. So what are you waiting for? Have fun!
0593044703|2.0|I was hoping this was going to be the dark fantasy series I'd been waiting for. It isn't.<br />For every plus in this novel, there's a huge minus. The world building is exceptional and a nice change from those cutesy elves and grumpy dwarves but the excess of detail cripples the story.   In one scene, a thief scurries through town past a harbour, the author names three of the ships in the harbour and their home ports which have nothing to do with any immediate or past events. It's as if he was being paid by the word count. <br />Garden of the Moon is meandering, unfocused, and overwritten fantasy that's poorly structured to boot. I was thankful a list of the characters came with the novel, for I was still refering back to it with fifty pages to go. You shouldn't have to do that if a writer is doing his job. The story should tell itself. This novel doesn't and asks for far too much patience and effort on the readers part.  <br />Erickson has a great prose style but an editor should have clipped this book by about a third as well.
B000002UDD|3.0|Yes, the 88release is not as classic as peace sells and two of the members were replaced before the record was done. This is a very Varried album with many good songs and a few not so good, ex. 502, Anarchy. Anyway In My Darkest Hour is a true classic and from this point Megadeth would evolve enourmosly. Good album.
B000069HK2|5.0|I wasnt very excited about The Used when they first appeared on my television, but out of curiosity I checked them out and MUCH to my suprise...they totally kicked...!!! I went out and bought the CD as soon as i could and I havent taken it out of my cd player since!! To anyone that's curious about The Used and whether or not the cd is worth buying...YES YES YES!!! Download some songs, give them a listen!! They will blow you away!! Bert has some AWESOME lyrics and screams with the best of them!! I totally recommend this album to anyone who needs some fresh music in their cd collection.
6302293553|5.0|For anyone not convinced there's a fine line between comedic genius and outright insanity, I recommend MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL.  The Python troupe takes the legend of King Arthur and mutates it into a hilarious kaleidescope of off-the-deep-end slapstick and parody.  Some of the humor is just plain silly (Black Knight:  &quot;Come on and fight, you coward!&quot;  Arthur:  &quot;But I've just cut your leg off!&quot;  Black Knight (pauses):  &quot;It's only a flesh wound.&quot;), and we know it's silly, yet the viewer is still laughing uncontrollably.  Python can pull off looney tunes comedy like Olivier reciting Shakespeare; it's the reason the group enjoyed phenomenal success in the Seventies.<br />Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin move in and out of this film in a headspinning variety of roles.  From tapdancing knights to a killer rabbit to rude Frenchmen throwing livestock from the top of a castle, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is wacky, satisfying comic bliss.  By far the best of all the Python films.
B000089RVX|5.0|For those who have been waiting for Evanescence's (Ev) big break, this is it. With solid sonorous vocals by Amy Lee and some amazing guitar riffs by Ben Moody, this band is on the upswing. With luck and good support from an already established core fanbase and an ever expanding group of new listeners, this band has no limits except for their own emotional and creative ceiling. They are also amazing live so if you have an opportunity to see them live, take that chance. The best part is that they are humble and honest in their music. The songs written are based on real life and speak to the listener's soul.<br />If you get a chance, find their original album (Origin) and any of their EPs. They are even better than Fallen.<br />Enjoy Listening
B00005JLO2|4.0|The Four Feathers is an epic story of a man trying to regain his honor.  Heath Ledger stars as Harry Feversham,a soldier who decides to resign his commision in the army just days before his unit is shipped out.  Three of his closest friends and his fiance, played by Kate Hudson, send him four white feathers, a sign of cowardice. Harry travels to the Sudan to prove he is not a coward.<br /> This movie is an epic movie that succeeds in many things that it sets out to do.  The desert and battle scenes are excellent showing the beauty of the miles and miles of sand as well as the chaos of the battles.  Heath Ledger gives a good performance as Harry while Djimon Hounsou(Gladiator) as Harry's desert guide steals the show in almost ever scene he is in.  Also giving a good performance is Wes Bentley as Harry's loyal friend, Jack.  Overall the movie is very good in portraying the time.  Mostly good performances with the background setting of the 1880's, both in England and the Sudan.  DVD is worthwhile with several featurettes, a making of documentary and widescreen presentation.  Well worth the price!
B00005ARS9|5.0|So many of their songs are well known, and not just to those who were raised on this music, but to people of all ages. Part of the reason may be that surf music is inextricably linked with the sixties - you won't find any modern equivalent.<br /><br />Here you get the classic songs they wrote themselves - California girls, Fun fun fun, Good vibrations, Little deuce coupe, Help me Rhonda, God only knows, Darlin', I get around and Wouldn't it be nice to name just a few  - together with songs that they covered in their own unique way - Do you wanna dance, Then I kissed her, Sloop John B and Cotton fields.<br /><br />There have been plenty of compilations of their music down the years and will be many more. Given the number of classic songs they recorded, picking just thirty inevitably means that some great songs get left out. Yet, this compilation is as good as any you are ever likely to find. For absolute perfection, I would have preferred In my room or Bluebirds over the mountain (perhaps the best two songs not included) to Caroline no, but this is a minor quibble.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson come up with lots of pranks and antics that keep you entertained throughout but some of the jokes were too overboard like making fun of the Malaysian Prime Minister, a Chinese fellow (for a change) that looks so moronic and irritating, which was totally unnecessary. Naturally, Malaysia banned the movie. The movie is potential 5 star material if not for this overt blunder.
0393307050|2.0|If you love this period in time, you'll love this novel. It captures the language and culture of the period, and presents it as a sea tale aboard one of her Majesty's sloops of the line. If the language and the sociology and politics of the Napoleonic period occupy a special place in your heart and your library, Patrick O'Brian's _Master and Commander_ will keep you satisfied, from the first concert to the final court martial.         If you don't find this period at all interesting, this book is going to be a disappointment. It takes you on an adventure and you learn as you go, just as the reader's surrogate Dr. Maturin does, but to paraphrase, there's no there there: the story is weak and the character development even weaker. Everything is right there on the surface; nothing, besides the sailing experience, is revealed. It's a great story, just not a great book.         That's great if you want to sail along with the crew of the Sophie, but not worth the effort if you want anything else.
B000008LUN|4.0|Honestly this isn't the band's debut, but for all practical purposes it is.  They released 3 studio lps and a live one without Schenker before this but they were disoriented space rock with no direction or appeal.  They really don't deserve to take up space in your UFO collection because they have nothing in common with everything that was to follow and just don't fit or belong.  Everyone should start (chronologically) here.  It took me years to truly appreciate Phenomenon because for the longest time it just seemed slightly flat compared to the rest of the stuff with Schenker, especially when the follow up Force It rocked SO MUCH harder.  In reality, that wasn't a fair perspective.  This recording is more acoustic and mellower than most ventures, but that helps set it apart and give you something when that is what you have a taste for.  Beside the 2 well known classics (you know them), standout tracks include: Too Young To Know (a track as good as any and better than most) and Time On My Hands.  The new BBC Archive CD is a must companion because it contains many alternate versions of lp tracks. If all this sounds good, it truely is. This recording comes highly recommended. Four stars is very appropriate. Five stars are given to freely. Afterall, they do represent the absolute best don't they?  Only OBSESSION and STRANGERS deserve those because they are the absolute best. ALL of the early Schenker records receive 4 stars except NO HEAVY PETTING which only deserves 3.
6302859204|5.0|I remembered watching this movie with my dad and i thought it was just another alien abdudction movie, whoopdeedoo. Then came the part where the syrup falls into his mouth and he recollects all the events he encountered while he was inside the spaceship. I am pretty certain however, that what the aliens did to him in that experiment room never actually occured. They cover him with some sort of blanket that melts onto his skin and he just starts screaming so they put the blanket over his head. Then they start doing this experiment where they use clamps and needles, at one point it looks like he's about to take a needle in the eye (ouch!). I'm sure if they did something like that he still wouldn't be around today. But even so, that's the best part of this movie. D.B. Sweeney acting skills really show through in that sequence. The rest of the movie is based on Travis's friends telling the police what happened and what led up to it, then trying to prove to everyone they didn't murder Travis. All in all it is a good movie, but I suggest you don't let your kids see it.
B00005R87Q|1.0|I was really trying to avoid seeing this movie. People were telling me to watch it, but after seeing the commercials I knew what kind of movie it would be...and I was right. It was aweful. No point to it. Im not a racing fan to begin with, but i saw this hbo when there was nothing on. Okay you will like this movie if you are one of those people who are like \\"MY CAR HAS A 200ZR2000 V18 WITH SUPERULTRA BOOSTERS THAT WILL BEAT YOUR CAR ANY DAY\\". bluntly, if your a racing freak or just one of those trailorpark persons who try to be cool by talking about cars, you will probably find this entertaining. But for the rest of us, you will notice there is no point to the movie. The producers probably said \\"LETS TAKE A BALD GUY WITH A ROBOTIC VOICE, PUT HIM TANKTOPS AND GIVE HIM COOL CARS. DOING THIS WILL MAKE GIRLS, SCRUBS AND ROBOTS WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!\\" Vin whats-his-name can not even act. Then he gives a bunch of cheesy one-liners like \\"i live my life a quarter mile at a time\\" YEAH...nice philosophy, wonder how long it took someone to make that up. People who said this was good movie probably was not paying attention to the actually movie, but to the race scenes, which were not that bad. Eiether that or the 5 stars were for Paul Walkers hair. Hes got good hair.
B000002ULO|3.0|All the talk about \\"Flaming Pie\\", and \\"Calico Skies\\" being added to the new Macca concert set list, got me wondering why I hadn't listened to this again since the week it came out. All I could remember about it was that it had been up for a Grammy at the time, and \\"Young Boy\\" was annoying. <br />I gave it a fresh spin recently and it all came back to me. There are some good songs here, but over all it is actually pretty boring. The only thing keeping me awake until the end was forcing myself to not hit the fast forward buttons. For a cd to be 5 stars, let alone be Grammy nominated (as laughable as that usually ends up) basically every song should be great. That is certainly not the case here. \\"McCartney\\" is his only official release I never skip songs on, even Band on the Run has a few tracks that have worn out their welcome or weren't that great to start with. I prefer \\"McCartney II\\" over this with \\"Summer's Day Song\\" and \\"One of these Days\\" being better soft songs than \\"Calico Skies\\", and nothing on \\"Pie\\" rocks as much as \\"Back to the Egg\\". <br />It's actually weird what Macca ends up choosing to officially release compared to what sits in the vaults, or gets stuck on a single's B-side. I consistently get more enjoyment listening to his B-sides and bootleged outtakes than his \\"real\\" albums like \\"Flaming Pie\\". When Ringo consistently releases better studio CDs than Paul does, something in the Macca camp needs a major adjustment.<br />As for that Grammy nomination, Macca can only hope to ever come up with a CD in the same league beginning-to-end as George's brilliant \\"Brainwashed\\". He hasn't yet. \\"Ringo Rama\\" is far superior to this also. I have already listened to \\"Ringo Rama\\" more times in 3 days than all of Paul's releases over the years since 1980 combined. For that matter, from the same general time period as \\"Flaming Pie\\", Sugar \\"Copper Blue\\" and Built to Spill's \\"Keep it Like a Secret\\" eat \\"Pie\\" for a snack! Unless you have to have everything Beatles relatedlike me, you would be much better off getting any of those other four discs instead of this.
B000068TPN|4.0|\\"We Were Soldiers,\\" directed by Randall Wallace, tells the story of an air cavalry unit during the Vietnam conflict. Mel Gibson plays the unit commander, and Barry Pepper plays a journalist assigned to cover the unit as they face intense combat. Madeleine Stowe plays the commander's wife, who, together with other Army wives, faces intense challenges of her own back at home.<br />I found this to be a well made and thoughtful film; I especially admire the way the filmmakers tell both the story of the soldiers in combat and the interconnected story of their families back at home. Although some scenes seemed a bit forced and obvious, overall I thought the film was very moving. It has intense combat scenes, intimate human drama, and welcome touches of humor. The aforementioned actors are all excellent in their roles, but my favorite performance is given by Sam Elliott as a no-nonsense, battle-tested sergeant major. Elliott and Gibson have solid onscreen chemistry together.<br />The DVD version of the film includes deleted scenes that further flesh out the characters. There is also a superb \\"making of\\" documentary which gives many insights into the film's production. The director, actors, director of photography, visual effects supervisor, and others give fascinating perspectives on their contributions. It is particularly moving to see some of the real-life people who are portrayed by actors in the film. This is one of those wonderful documentaries that makes you appreciate the film more and want to see it again.
B000066NW0|3.0|This is a review of _Let Go_ by Avril Lavigne.<br />There are at least a dozen reasons to NOT like this album.  Here are three.  First, Lavigne herself is a phoney:  she's not really a &quot;skater,&quot; or a musician, or a song-writer. (Notice that ALL of her songs are co-written, mostly with a collection of co-authors referred to as &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  If she really could write music, she's have at least one song of her own on the album.)  Second, the lyrics are often painfully puerile.  How could anybody have written, &quot;He was a boi [sic] / she was a girl / can I make it any more obvious?  /  He was a punk /she did ballet / what more can I say?&quot;  Third, there is no unifying &quot;voice&quot; or &quot;vision&quot; on this album.  (There's even a rap song thrown in, just to show how &quot;street&quot; she is, I guess.)<br />However, there is one reason to like this album, and it trumps every other consideration:  the music is fun to listen to.<br />In the end, it doesn't make any difference whether Lavigne is a great (or even competent) artist, or whether your friends will look askance at you for humming along.  The ultimate test of music is whether it is enjoyable.  The worst tracks on this album are less than memorable, but harmless, and the best ones will stick in your head whether you like it or not.  (It doesn't hurt that, whatever her limitations, Lavigne does seem to have a genuinely good voice.)<br />The best songs are probably &quot;Complicated,&quot; (the albums's biggest hit), &quot;I'm with You&quot; (another hit), and &quot;Naked&quot; (which hasn't received much airplay), in all of which Lavigne sounds surprisingly soulful for pop music, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; [sic], the fast rhythm of which pulls you along despite yourself, and the jaunty and likable &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; and &quot;My World.&quot;<br />So don't be a snob:  order this and admit you like it!
B000060P79|1.0|When I first heard Simple Plan's \\"I'd Do Anything\\", I seriously thought it was Sum 41. This band lacks in creativity and originality. The lyrics just plain .... As the cd goes on, the songs get worse and worse. I mean c'mon, an alien girlfriend? I can see they were trying to go for some creativity there, but it obviously backfired. <br />I suggest not buying this cd unless you are a real fan of pop-rock bands such as Sum 41, Blink-182 and Good Charlotte..<br />If you are looking for a more punk cd, I reccomend The Distillers, Anti-Flag, Finch and Thursday
B00005JLXC|4.0|So this isn't a great movie. I was still pleasantly surprised. The story was interesting. The acting was fine (Ben Affleck made a convincing \\"Daredevil,\\"). The lesser characters were well portrayed (\\"Bull's-eye\\" was appropriately nasty, and even the ... man playing the \\"Kingpin\\" role was okay- did he have to be a not so fat ... man, come on Stan Lee- you should have protested that decision). The person who \\"stole the show\\" was Jennifer Garner as \\"Elektra.\\" Who cares about the character she was playing in the overall story; she was just plain awesome with her appearance alone. What a BABE! WOW!
B000002NZO|5.0|I have always loved this particular Genesis album. At first listen I was very impressed, and that is when I listened to it on vinyl. Each track has its own persona. Let me break down by each track.<br />Looking For Someone: This track is a great intro for this album. It starts out at a moderate tempo then wanes to a sweet harmony then near the end it shuts out with gusto! A beautiful finale for this track.<br />White Mountain: A great tune with a beautiful flow of acoustic guitars. Gabriel's vocals really come out here on this track. The outro of this song is very breezy and serene, almost haunting.<br />Visions of Angels: This has to be one of the rawest tracks on the album. It could very well be a modern day poem. The chorus of this song is my favourite, as is the verses. Very simplistic track despite its length, and it holds up very well. I am reminded of a wedding when I here this tune. I really do love it!<br />Stagnation: A somber tune which changes mood after the previous track. To me this tune is of the more creative tracks. At one point it sounds a bit depressing but picks up with a swirl of energy as most Genesis songs do.<br />Dusk: Another somber, but steady song. The tempo does not change much in this tune. But as the title suggest, it is dusk, time to nap eh? Not a bad tune to listen to and is actually one of my favourites. The flute work of Gabriel really shows in this tune. A very mellow and pristine tune.<br />The Knife: This is where this album picks up the pace. An epic tune all done in about 8 minutes. This track is packed with power and creativeness. There is a touch of early 70's heavy metal sound with art rock mixed in. You will see when you get towards the end of the track. Definitley the standout of this album.<br />All in all this CD is great ear candy and is very much the same as reading a book as long  as you listen and understand the lyrics. There is a bit of obscurism in the sounds of the music, but thats what makes this one heck of analbum!
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|DTS is the best-it feels like you're sitting front-row center at the MGM Grand Hotel where this speciaal was taped!I love the DVD because the Bee Gees sound better than ever!The brothers sing hits spanning their career from &quot;New York Minin Disaster&quot; to their latest hits.They even sing songs they wrote for others.A must for any Bee Bees fan,it will be played a lot more than one night only!This is my all- time favorite DVD.You'll love it,too.
0743455967|5.0|This book is a very enjoyable read.  It's partly a memoir and partly a workshop on how to write- both parts are enjoyable and very interesting.  It was a lot of fun to hear the stories about King as a child, teenager, and young man struggling to scrape together a living and anxious to get his work published.  Apparently the man is human after all, since we get to see him as vulnerable, with an uncertain future, before he was able to establish himself.  My guess is that he eventually would have succeeded even without &quot;Carrie&quot;, since I think he's a special talent who would have persevered in his writing and would eventually have been recognized.  His advice on writing is particularly interesting, even if you're not an aspiring writer- it gives the reader a new lens through which to view his stories.  Overall, an excellent read.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.
B000002UAX|3.0|The Beatles White Album is a good album overall. However there are some very veak tracks in between some of the songs. <br />This album should not have been a two disc set because about half of the songs on this album aren´t good or really bad.<br />The best tracks on this album: Back In The U.S.S.R, Dear Prudance, Ob La Di Ob La Da, While My Guitar Gentle Weeps, Martha My Dear, Piggies, Sexy Sadie, Helter Skelter.
B000002GQE|5.0|This is an essential CD to own not just because you might happen like The Moody Blues, but because it's a jewel from the 60's that still has its' lustre. <br />It still shines brightly musically, and though I agree that some tracks sound a bit dated--Hey, it's still great!<br />This is one of the first great Progressive Rock gems after The Beatles 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' and it's every bit as good as anything The Beatles did!<br />I really dig the Progressive Rock sound, and 'Days Of Future Passed' stands as a GREAT early entry into that genre!<br />I just love the Orchestrations and 60's Rock Sounds mixed together seamlessly as one long set piece.<br />When you say 'The Moody Blues', This is the album your average Rock Fan has heard at least one or two tracks from.<br />I really equate this album with Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side Of The Moon' as one of the greatest 'concept' albums ever!<br />(Plus, they've always been great to listen to late at night  possibly whilst indulging in one's favorite intoxicant.) :)<br />A lot of great influential music came from the 60's--where would we be today without the likes of Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles etc.?  <BR>I think that some of the most creative music ever recorded came from the mid to late 1960's and early to mid 1970's!<br />It's actually the first CD I ever owned, and I agree the remastering sounds better. <br />A MUST HAVE!
0743424425|5.0|In this case, the movie was as good as the book, thanks to Stanley Kubrick directing it.  Nonetheless, the book is well worth reading as well, since the entire story is absolutely chilling.  The Overlook Hotel is a great setting for maximum creepiness; it's a great place for people to go insane.  I'm not sure the supernatural phenomena were necessary to increase the horror, though I'm guessing King would say they are central to the story.  Overall, one of King's better books.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|It is so hard to believe that this was a late '70s record.  Unlike a lot of the overblown rock by bands like the Stones, The Who, and Zeppelin, here was a band that was extremly tight and could flat out play.  Now 25 years later this album is still timeless in its flawlessnes.  My Favorite tracks are Lions and Wild West End.  You can see why Mark was already playing on Bob Dylan's late '70s records and would later appear on Infidels in '83.  I've always thought of Mark Knopfler as a guitar slinging Bob Dylan and this record shows why.  Great imagery firmly routed in the Blues with superior muscianship.
B000065U1N|5.0|... it was the most realistic and true movie made in the recent decade.I think this is on par with the epic movies like \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\",\\"Khartoum\\" and \\"Platoon\\".
0972169504|4.0|This is a unique collection of hilarious comic strips about graduate school life drawn by Jorge Cham, a genuine PhD student at Stanford University. Anyone who has ever been or known a graduate student struggling towards the completion of his or her thesis will recognize and appreciate the characters and scenarios herein. And although there are a number of inside jokes, and knowing the real-life inspirations for some of the characters certainly added to my personal enjoyment, most of the strips reflect the universal absurdities of the grad school experience rather than being specific to Stanford students. Highly recommended!
B00005R23X|4.0|First, let me say that this version of \\"Dracula\\" is the first film adaptation to do justice to the novel.  It is strikingly shot and directed with an almost operatic style.  It draws the viewer in and does not let go.<br />Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins absolutely chew up the scenery.  It's enough to make you think, \\"Bela Who?\\"  The supporting cast is also superb (I especially liked Tom Waits as the demented Renfield).  <br />Then there are Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder.  Sometimes, unexpected casting can yield unexpected rewards (Tom Cruise in \\"Born on the Fourth of July\\" comes to mind).  This, sadly, was not one of those times.  Ryder seems uneasy in the role, like she never quite found her groove.  Reeves, on the other hand, was an all-out distraction.  First, he doesn't sound British; he sounds congested.  Coming, as it did, only a year after Kevin Costner's now-you-hear-it-now-you-don't accent in \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\", this was a glaring flaw.  His manner, in places, actually made me think he was having another excellent adventure.  It just doesn't work.<br />But back to the good stuff.  Gary Oldman's Dracula is mesmerizing.  This one deserved an Academy Award, in my opinion.  And Anthony Hopkins' Van Helsing is another scene-stealing turn for this enormously gifted actor.  The film would be worth the price for these performances alone.<br />Francis Ford Coppola's direction gives the whole film a foreboding quality that never seems forced.  He has made the definitive Dracula movie.  It is too bad about the miscasting, though.<br />A highly recommended film that could have been just a little bit better.
0790736039|5.0|Stephen is at his best in his horror movie IT. Im only 9 but believe me i pretty fraekin know if its it is a scary movie and believe me when i say this THIS MOVIE IS SCARY.the part where penywise the clown ate bills brother with his razor sharp teeth made me know this movie was going a thriller. i definetely recomend that you buy this video.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the best film ever that mixs animation with live action. Lame movies such as Cool World and Space Jam have tried to be like Roger Rabbit but have failed.<br /> Roger Rabbit has been framed for murder by an evil toon and only one man can save him, the former detective for toons Eddie Valent. Eddie Valent used to take cases for toons until one killed his brother. He has to come face to face with his past in-order to save Roger.<br /> Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valent as is Christopher Lloyd as the villain. It's the special effects that are the real star in Who Framed Roger Rabbit though. They're flawless and you get the feel that the actors are really talking and interacting with the toons.<br /> I really would of loved if they made a few sequels but it's a little late for that now since you don't really see Bob Hoskins around anymore. He had much more star power then than he does now as well.<br /> The only problem that I still have with the film is that it has a very adult theme to it and isn't as much for kids as a movie with a bunch of famous cartoon characters should be. There's one point where Donald Duck calls Daffy Duck a really bad prejudice word for instance. You have to listen hard to hear it but it's there. Still though Daffy versues Donald is so much fun that I wouldn't mind a sequel just to see go at it again.<br /> The dvd for this movie is a dream come true for me. When they released that no feature version on dvd I was really disapointed. This dvd totally makes up for it though. It's one of the best dvd's of this new year for sure. I've only seen the Roger Rabbit short Tummy Trouble but this dvd gives you the chance to see all 3 of his shorts. It's just an awesome dvd. It's a must have for every Roger Rabbit fan.
B00003CXWV|1.0|I love gangster movies like Scarface and The Godfather, and Johnny Deep is clearly one of our best actors, so this movie looked like a winner. Boy was I wrong. Badly written, badly directed, and completely misguided. Nothing happens in this movie except an unappealing scumbag drug dealer gets arrested over and over. Why should we care? How this man's story ever got told is a mystery to me. It's like Hollywood wanted to make a eulogy to their favorite drug dealer. We even get a loving picture of the real man at the end. Sigh. Really, I wasn't offended by this film, I just found it incredibly BORING. ... leave this dog on the shelf.
0767817478|2.0|First of all, let me just say... this new \\"godzilla\\" doesn't cut it. I mean, he is nothing but a big giant wussy thing. He gets caught up in a suspension bridge, gets hit with about 6 to 10 missiles (I don't have an exact count) and THAT kills him? COME ON! What's up with that?  He's nothing compared to the old godzilla.  <BR>I grew up watching old godzilla movies where the people were dubbed in, and those really entertained me. That godzilla is cool because he is unstoppable! Out of all the hundreds and hundreds of missiles and rockets and bullets and bombs that have hit him, none have really killed him!<BR>The reason that I gave the movie 2 stars is because it has a really cool nuclear test in the beginning.<BR>In conclusion, I don't believe that this thing deserves to be called \\"godzilla\\".
B00000IQUT|4.0|A friend of mine and I watched this movie, expecting a cool horror movie, we had heard about the scene where she cuts off an attackers penis, and thought it would be a fun movie. well, we were about as wrong as we've ever been.<br />THE STORY: Jennifer, rents a cabin to work on her novel, she meets this cute but dorky guy who instantly falls for her beauty and charm. Later in the film, the dorky guy and his friends attack her and rape her brutally. The treat her cruelly like an animal, and the dork loses his virginity to her. She gets away, and plots her revenge. Each man gets his own, and she brutally murders each one. <br />  This movie isnt a horror, and it certainly isnt an erotic film. the directing was cool, the acting could have been MUCH better. Though, Camille Keaton did a fairly good job. I think this movie is great because, it empowers women. I believe it says \\"sure you can knock us around, but you'll pay for it\\". And Jennifer definitely makes them pay for it!!!
0385504209|5.0|The search for the Holy Grail is one of the most intriguing enigmas of history, art and fiction. Speculation as to its location, its meaning, even its existence have fueled the imaginations of artists, writers, rulers and clerics for centuries. Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE is a stunning new thriller that presents a new slant on the meaning of the very nature of this vessel, which was purported to hold the blood of Christ.<br />Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is in Paris on business when he receives an urgent midnight call at his hotel from the Paris Judicial Police. The man he had planned to meet with the next day, a curator of the Louvre, has been found murdered in the Grand Gallery of the world's most famous art museum. Langdon has been summoned apparently because of his connection to the victim and his knowledge of ancient symbols.<br />He is rushed to the scene to find Jacques Sauniere's body lying spread eagled and naked with a pentagram painted on his torso. He is told that Sauniere apparently painted the symbol on his own chest and arranged his body in the bizarre position before he died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. Langdon's expertise in symbology and his acquaintance with the curator are called upon to help decipher the motive and help police find the killer.<br />Police detective Sophie Neveu from the Paris police cryptology division arrives on the scene; she and Langdon embark on a dangerous and frantic search for the murderer. They soon discover that Sauniere's message was not a clue to the identity of his killer, which is what the police believe, but instead holds a much deeper and significant message to mankind. The connections to the murderer reach into the very depths of some of the highest authorities of Europe.<br />Langdon and Neveu are ensnared in the ever-tightening mesh of this deadly triangle of power, as Langdon seeks to clear himself of suspicion of his colleague's murder. The desperate battle between The Priory of Scion, Opus Dei and the Vatican in the search for the Holy Grail airs one of the most fascinating theories on the Holy of Holies published in a very long time.<br />Dan Brown's extensive research on secret societies and symbology (he wrote ANGELS AND DEMONS, a bestseller about secret Italian religious societies) adds intellectual depth to this page-turning thriller. His surprising revelations on Da Vinci's penchant for hiding codes in his paintings will lead the reader to search out renowned artistic icons as The Mona Lisa, The Madonna of the Rocks and The Last Supper. The Last Supper holds the most astonishing coded secrets of all and, after reading THE DA VINCI CODE, you will never see this famous painting in quite the same way again.<br />Brown has given us a controversial subject wrapped in thriller clothing that will provoke debate in the circles of religious and secret societies --- and among readers.

B000002UUX|3.0|Okay, here's where I really start to rock the apple cart...<br />First of all, let me say that the musicianship on 'Rust In Peace' is without peer and set a quality standard by which all metal albums to follow would be judged. Megadave Mustaine here assembled what was far and away his most formidable lineup, with second guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza joining he and Dave Ellefson. All members' performances on this album are beyond fault. &quot;Holy Wars...The Punishment Due&quot; is probably my favorite Megadeth song of all. And the production excels, placing the guitars and drums right out front, ripping up everything in their path.<br />Almost every metal fan in the world considers this album to be among the all-time hierarchy of the genre. So why do I not share their enthusiasm?<br />Frankly, 'Rust In Peace' comes across to me as an album that's somewhat less than the sum of it's parts. With the exception of the aforementioned &quot;Holy Wars&quot;, I just find most of the songs themselves to be really rather dull and lacking in any real heaviness or aggression. In other words, it sounds like an album made up of filler material, albeit well-played filler material. Strangely enough, I do tend to prefer the somewhat &quot;lighter&quot; sound of the next three albums that followed this ('Countdown', 'Youthanasia', and 'Cryptic'), as well as the rawer, angrier approach of the first three albums before it ('Killing', 'Peace Sells', and 'So Far'). I bought this the day it came out, gave it a few listens, and put it away out of lack of interest. Thinking maybe I was just in the wrong frame of mind at the time, I recently broke it out again and tried to give it another chance. But every time I play this album, the same thing happens: three, maybe four songs in, and I'm bored. Whatever elevates 'Rust...' in the eyes of everybody else, well, I'm just not getting it.<br />Megadeth will go down in history, rightfully so, as one of metal's most elite acts, butI personally don't feel this to be their best effort at all.
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent has been in the New York City underground rap scene for some time now, and when this rapper was ultimately introduced to the world, people were amazed. I just bought his new album, Get Rich or Die Tryin'. Generally, my favorite rappers are Snoop D-o-double-g! and Dr. Dre and Eminem. But 50 Cent's album has made me happy to listen to and in many ways his album is better tha Dre's or Em's. Almost every song on here is good, and my favorites are P.I.M.P., In Da Club, Many Men, Heat, 21 Questions, Let's Get High and What Up Gangsta. 50 is also a great rapper because he lives what he raps, unlike many rappers. (Kid Rock, anyone?) 50 has been shot, done drugs, been in the slammer, and is simply a straight NYC gangsta. He also revolutionizes the rap genre by blending hip-hop with gangsta rap, or lighter tone with darker tone. For some great gangsta rappin', 50 Cent is prime material. One thing that you will notice is the awesome production job, courtesy of Dr. Dre, and Eminem. The beats are awesome! Also, 50's style of rapping, similar to Snoop Dogg, the lazy drawl, makes it even more fun to listen to. At first, I did not appreciate this album, but now it has become my favorite album, aside from The Marshall Mathers LP.  Any fan of rap will appreciate this album.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This is my first and only Blind Guardian album so far and only one word sums up my feelings about it: WOW!<BR> These dudes are truly THE Gods of Epic Symphonic Power Metal! <BR> Since I'm a huge fantasy/sci-fi/horror fan, I absolutely loved this album, what with it being based on J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Silmarillion\\". Not only does it have a great story but the vocals, riffs, and larger-than-life choruses are epic and amazing! The epic story unfolds before your eyes as you listen to this cd. As soon as you press the ON button on your CD player and the music starts, you're immediately transported to Middle Earth, during the diabolical reign of the dark god Morgoth. In the songs you can feel the emotions of the characters, as if you were right there with them: In the song \\"Into the Storm\\" you're right there with the Noldor elves as they're going to war against the dark god Morgoth. You can hear the anger and greed of the spider-demoness Ungoliant as she lusts for the mystic power of the Silmarils.<BR>  In the song \\"Nightfall\\" you can feel the pain, sadness, and anger in the hearts of the Noldor elves over the destruction of their sacred mystic Valinor Trees by Morgoth and Ungoliant. You can feel the darkness of the demonic forces of Morgoth sweep over the land of Middle Earth. <BR>  In the song \\"Time Stands Still\\", you find yourself riding into battle alongside the High King of the Noldor elves as he goes up against Morgoth in the Iron Mountains. You can see the fierce battle between them unfold before you.<BR>  These and several other songs on this cd will blow your mind!! <BR> I just can't say enough good things about this cd!! Every power metal fan should own it!!<BR> I've said it before, and I'll bloody well say it again: Blind Guardian are the Gods of Power Metal!!
6300147630|5.0|This is on my top ten favorite film list.  The moody atmosphere, the questions of sanity, the secrecy and the mind war going on make for a plot that could be either convuluted or sublime.  When I was looking at this film to review it, going through the other reviews tryign to see if there was anything new I could add, I wa sthinking about what a godo remake this could make.I'm not a huge remake fan my case in point being Gloria with first Gena Rowlands and then the remake with Sharon Stone which was essentially a mugging, much like my reviews of Jennifer Lopez's singing! lol<BR>Scanners though, made Michael Ironside a stand out actor for me and Jennifer O'Neal I later saw in Cover Up on CBS with John Erik Hexum.  The concepts dealt with here were pretty advanced for me as a chidl when I saw them in the movies but I'd been reading comic books so it wasn't that hard to follow.  The head blowing up scene, is probably horror movie classic but what I liked most about this was the secrecy elements, te stealth, the slow unravelling of this whole mammoth conspiracy and it's reprecussions.  Also this film is fair to both sides of good and \\"evil\\" here as it gets into advanced species dominance theories.  There is no clear cut choice of whois right or wrong in teh situation teh scanners find themselves and the end of merging the two theories into one person is brilliant in teh sense of film representing a high concept.
B00003CXUM|4.0|In the Mood for Love is such a charm despite a very simple plot. The year was 1962. Chow Mo Wan, a newspaper editor, recently moved into a dwelling populated by Shanghai immigrants with his wife. Through casual and accidental encounters Chow exchanged pleasantry with So Lai Jun (Mrs. Chan) who later found out about her husband's affair with Chow's wife. Heartbroken and devastated of the cruel truth, Chow buried himself in his job while So indulged in nightly movie screening. They began to let down the guard for one another and spent time during the mahjong sessions of their landlords. The characters forced themselves to abide by inveterate conventions and cultural morale that forbid an affair to become fruition. ...<br />Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung as usual deliver an impeccable performance in this 2001 Wong Kar-Wai release. Leung portraited a man who is unsatisfied about his marriage and denied his spouse's infidelity. Cheung seizes the empathy of her character who is accustomed to hush about reason for his husband's frequent absence. Maggie Cheung is elegant and charming in this movie. Not to mention the dazzling wardrobe she wears consistently over the entire movie. Her leg movements are captured in slow motion. Her arms dangling with the thermos meant for the late-night porridge order-to-go from the street vendor.<br />The movie is shot through a minimalist scope, that is, message is conveyed through very succinct scripts and imagery full of lush colors and meticulously chosen soundtracks. The film is shot in a very stealthy manner; it is as if a pin camera being fastened on the wall of the apartment. Conversations between Leung and Cheung are shot in an eavesdropping manner. The director seeks to de-emphasize other characters in order to focus on Leung and Cheung. Their spouse, respectively, always have their back facing the camera. Their performances are conducted by voices. The gaffer has done an excellent job adjusting the hues of light which is relativelydim throughout. <br />As a native of Hong Kong (born in mid-70s) who never witnessed the city in glory 60s, In the Move for Love has done me a favor in reminiscence. Wong Kar Wai makes sure everything is done just like when it was the 60s. Yes, even the restaurant menu to which Leung and Cheung skimmed through briefly. It was a green piece of cardboard decorated with some coconut tree clip art. Menu with such heavy Malaysian touch can still be found at local cafés that serve a fusion menu of Malaysian spices and sirloin steaks. Napkins are folded diamond-shaped like paper planes and kept at the far end of the booth. Leung and Cheung sip coffee from flimsy green chinaware cups that hold maybe three gulps. The green vinyl blinds hang unevenly at the office windows. The rotary phone. The subleased rooms where newly-wed couples rent and the kitchen with whom they share with their landlords. The white-collared wardrobe worn by housemaids. These are all the epitomes of lives in the 60s, in Hong Kong. Some find this mmovie a little slow-paced. I savor the manner in which the film is made. I savor all the details, the choice of colors and the tiptoeing scores in the film. 4.6 stars...
B000002LOE|5.0|This was the first REM album I listened to and , although I have listened to all their subsequent albums and Document, Life's Rich Pageant and Green before it, it still remains the most pleasurable. Like most REM albums, it has multiple meanings but it has generally come to be regarded as their 'love' album. This effect is partly achieved by Kate Pierson's warm and lively presence on tracks like Shiny Happy People and Me in Honey. To me, this album sounds like a lost summer with the mandolins and baroque instrumentation Automatic for the People would wallow more blatantly in nostalgia on Man on the Moon and politics in Drive and Ignoreland and twisted the tunes even more than Country Feedback was threatening on OOT. Their ultimate 'twisted' album was Monster, that picked up where Monster's Star Me Kitten left off. >So Out of Time is a lot of things- KRS-One's funny, ironic rap that makes you think (Radio Song) a sunny surf/road album (Near Wild Heaven, Texarkana), a baroque meditation (Losing my religion, Endgame, Half the World Away), and something inbetween (Shiny Happy People). The likes of Low and Belong sound ancient and tribal, a perfect counter-evolution of the Beach Boy style  harmonies. But there is nothing simple about the thought processes behind this album- it takes a lot of intelligence, a lot of avant-garde thinking, to sound this upbeat yet this sombre. Michael Stipe's warm, resonant voice is recorded in digital while the instruments are recorded by analogue. The cover art and inside sleeves are, for once, not just afterthoughts. The sound is crystal clear and it resonates with that sense of being revolutionary yet innocent that fully emerged, blinking in the summer of the very early nineties, from the likes of The La's, The Stone Roses and, in their own way, Nirvana. To any ordinary band, this would be, undisputedly, their finest moment. To me, it still is.
0312305060|5.0|The Hours is one of the best novels I've read in years.  I heard someone else describe it as a \\"meditation on the gifts the dying leave to the living.\\"  That's a a profound and rich theme that isn't often explored in popular literature.  I suspect that's why some of the negative reviews here seem so angry; mortality isn't a topic we like to think about particularly.  I feel bad for those who can only see it as a \\"story about weepy women.\\"  And I feel worse for those who think it's boring.  I was intrigued to follow Cunningham's rich themes through connections made among these three times and their related characters.  These relations through time, the parallel attempts to connect, to create lives worth living, for me, temper the existential despair at the root of the book by revealing the universality of it all--with art's ability to help us through.  This is one of those books that I have a hard time articulating its full meaning and impact on me.  That happens rarely, and I usually see it as a sign that the work is tapping something deep, primal and profound.  <br />Some reviewers denounce the book, as if they expected it to be a biography of Woolf or a sequel to Mrs. Dalloway.  I'm male and I hadn't yet read Mrs. Dalloway, and my experience with Woolf is scant, which may be a blessing in appreciating The Hours.  I've seen Woolf scholars get their panties in a twist because they think The Hours is an inaccurate portrait of Woolf and her work.  Maybe it is, but THAT'S NOT THE POINT, people.  Others here dismiss the book, wanting \\"more plot\\" and character development.  Some are confused by the time shifts.  If you're one who wants your reading predictable, simple and always the same, The Hours is probably not for you.  If, instead, you like a challenge and are willing to let yourself be carried along on this internal journey, you might be be richly rewarded.

B000005Z0E|3.0|This strongly political and aggressive album did not kick start Tupac Shakur's music career massively but did establish him as one to watch for the future. Production of the album adds a bit extra to his lyrics, which on 2Pacalypse Now had different views showing his loyalty to his \\"homies\\" on \\"If My Homies Call\\", his polictial anger on \\"Just Don't Give A F***\\" and his poetic talent and mixed emotions on \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\". <br />Production of the album, composed by Tupac's former group Digital Underground, is not outstanding but provides enough good beats to keep you listening. This album is more lyrically strong and does lack the creativeness that his following albums contain. Although songs \\"If My Homie Calls\\" and \\"Young Black Male\\" show his lyrical ability at its best, his strong words flowing smoothly with the background beat with no hesitation. <br />This opinionated, emotional, poetic, political and humorous album shows Tupac's views that eventually vanished on his follow up albums and finally ceased to exist when he signed with the infamous Death Row Records in 1996. Although this album attained sales in a time when the evolution of gangsta rap was in the process, it was not proclaimed an instant classic such as debut albums \\"Ready To Die\\" by the Notorious BIG or \\"Illmatic\\" by Nas in 1994. Tupac's fame was to rise soon after this release not only by his music, but also his run-ins with the law.

0767805712|5.0|Is one doomed to failure or a mediocre life because of his or her invalid physical being?  Should one be denied with the right to be successful because of his or her being physically inferior? The film obviously gives us a definite answer.<br />The film starts with some big sounds made by hairs and nails falling onto the ground, which is seemingly unexplainable because of the supposed lightness of hairs and nails.  Then, the main character, Vincent Freeman begins his narration of his sorrow childhood in which his right to go to school is denied because he is genetically deficient.  His younger brother, who is genetically engineered before birth, is however the perfect human being.  In spite of his inborn disadvantage, he holds a dream of being an astronaut.  Nevertheless, his dream is only an illusion that cannot be realized in a society where one&iexcl;¯s professional success is predetermined solely by one&iexcl;¯s genes.  He finally leaves his home where his parents and brother all discourage him for his &iexcl;°naive&iexcl;± fantasy, and he goes to work in Gattaca Aerospace Center where he is close to his dream and yet so far away as his work is a janitor.  Compelled by his unrealized dream, he finds a then-swimming winner, now-cripple, Jerome Morrow.  Vincent uses Jerome Morrow&iexcl;¯s blood, hair, and urine in order to disguise himself as Morrow and to pass the DNA test at the entrance of the aerospace center.  With all his efforts and determination, he, an intelligent young man, finally gets the chance to go the space.<br />In the film, Vincent&iexcl;¯s last name, Freeman, is allegorically significant because he, in spite of his DNA deficiency, succeeds out of the limitation of physical; on the contrary, Jerome&iexcl;¯s last name, Morrow, which means tomorrow, has an ironic implication as he, despite his superior genes, has not much future due to the fact that he canis immobilized due to an accident.<br />This film invites the audience to meditate the relationship between physical and spiritual and whether one's fate should be determined by its physical inferiorityspiritual and whether one's fate should be determined by its physical inferiority

B00004YC2F|4.0|After listeing to Rachamninoff Piano Concerto No. 3 recorded by various pianists, such as Ashkenazy, Argerich, Horowits,and etc, I was surprised that I was able to find another recording that can clearly rank the first tier of the interpretation of this work. Volodos plays this piece with extreme clarity. And his technic strength is clearly shown in this recording. Particular the first movement, his playing flows fluently. The third movement is one of the fastest that I've ever heard. However, two things that make me feel that I should not give this recording five stars. First is the orchestra. The orchestra sounds very remote and hollow, which cannot give the soloist enough support (indeed competition in this particular work). Second is that volodos' way of playing is not, in my understanding, passionate enough. Rachmaninoff's concertos defy harmony and require conflicts and extreme passion. However, Volodos' playing, though fast, is not passionate enough. Probably, in order to speed up, he sacrifies the strengh that is inevitable when playing this composition. His playing lacks the overwhelming power that gives listeners a strong sense of struggling and competiting, and it doesn't have enough tension that is typical in Rachmaninoff's concertos.<br />  All in all, this recording is a good showcase of the technique that is required for playing Rach No.3. But if you want to buy a recording that is both technically and sentimetally supreme, Martha Argerich's recording is a highly recommended because it is electrifying and extremely passionate.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The Americans ruined Spirited Away (or at least set its quality down by 25%) just like they ruined other great anime (no S in pluralis) like Sailor Moon, Tenchi Muyo and Records of Lodoss War.<br />At least they didn't cut the movie's length down this time, but they altered the dialogue, which is very disturbing as Disney would probably sue whatever country altered the dialogue in THEIR movies! If you're gonna dub a movie, at least use the original dialogue translated literally, but with SOME alterations for fluity.<br />However, the movie is still worth a view, as it's still brilliant and can beat any Disney movie with great lengths. I've got my fingers crossed hoping that it'll win the 2003 Oscar for \\"Best animated movie\\"!<br />As for the animation, it's in Ghibli Studios' standard style. Think \\"My Neighbour Totoro\\", only with better drawing and coloring techniques. But if you want real-life like anime, then you're out of luck. The animation is brilliant in its own special way, though.<br />As for the part where Americans parents rant on and on about how scary the movie was: Oh, put a sock in it, will ya'! I was outraged when I found out that Americans parents wanted \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\" banned from TV just because season 6 had a few love scenes! For a country that's supposed to stand for freedom and intelligence, the parents are quite naive. They raise the children in such a bad way that they get scared by \\"Spirited Away\\", which I personally wouldn't have found scary when I was 6-10. (I'm 17 now)<br />Yes, the movie does start off slowly and you do sit there sometimes and ask yourself \\"What the heck just happened here?\\", but once it starts getting good, it only gets better!<br />Definitely worth a view if you want a movie that's not the typical \\"Big scary monsters to fight, boy and girl, boy and girl of course fall in love, everything is fine and dandy all the way through, no good guys harmed greatly, super-happy ending\\"-movie (you know, the way that ALL Disney movies have been ever since the very 1st, \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" (learn to spell, Disney!)). Go see it! Bring your kids!
B000001GQJ|5.0|While her repertoire ranges from Baroque to late Romanticism, Martha Argerich is often regarded as one of the greatest Romanticist pianist. If you are still not sure about the reason how she is qualified to be the winner of Chopin Competition, listening to this recording can clearly offer you the answer: her passion, her technical tour de force, her clarity, and her superior sense of musicality. Particularly in the first track (Chopin Scherzo No. 3 In C Sharp Minor, Op.39), Argerich plays with much consideration. She plays with thundering strengh when needed (i.e. at 00:18); sometimes, she plays as if she is singing tenderly with gentle affection (i.e. betweeb 1:21-2:15). Between 4:42-5:26, she plays with a touch  of grief. The piece is ended with thundering strength, leaving the listeners breathless, thinking still about her playing.

B00007G1ZC|3.0|Being a great fan of the old 1991 Laserdisc version of this movie, I was excited to finally hear that a DVD copy was available. I purchashed it right away in hopes of showing off my progessive scan DVD player (with component hookups) and my snazzy new 16:9 widescreen 46&quot; Sony HDTV. Sadly, this DVD version's quality wasn't anything like I remembered.<br />10 years ago, I owned this movie on the old Laserdisc format, and the quality was unbelievable. The colors in every segment seemed so perfect, so sharp - that the movie was almost surreal in it's presentation. It just jumped out at you with impossibly perfect reds and stunning blues. I remember loading this Laserdisc when friends came to visit and I really wanted to WOW them with the &quot;new digital laserdisc&quot; technology.<br />Sadly, it appears this DVD version is a transfer from an inferior, analog source. The widescreen complaints from other reviewers confirm this suspicion. Sure, the DVD looks good, and sounds good, but just doesn't have the impact - color/picture/etc - that the original did. Film grain and dust specks are clearly visible throughout the movie and most edges are fuzzy. My 4 year old DVD of West Side Story is sharper and more vivid than Dreams. I can't stress enough that this DVD seems to be more of a transfer than an actual remastered version of the original.<br />This DVD reminds me of the Goodfellas DVD transfer, which was also released years ago without any significant DVD bonus features or, more importantly, an enchanced digital transfer from an original copy. <br />Perhaps I'm being picky, but I remember Dreams as being both a wonderful movie *and* a fabulous technological showpiece for my home theater system. Now it's just another DVD in my collection, looking as technically &quot;good&quot; as Animal House or Heat. Hopefully Criterion will release an enhanced, completely remastered version of this fantastic film in the near future.

B00005JLXC|3.0|\\"Daredevil\\" can stand its ground in the teen-action market with ludicrously choreographed fight sequences, an ear-flaying soundtrack, and a visual style boasting more flair and realism than \\"Spider-Man\\". But when it comes to plot, characterization and the inevitable love interest, it's an entirely different story. Or, rather, it isn't one. And that's a problem. Hamstrung by repetitve romantic and 'character' scenes, the plot never gets off the ground. While this may have been a deliberate choice - a movie-length Act 1 to an endless series of sequels - it just isn't interesting. Rather than coming up with a character-establishing adventure which is thrilling in its own right (as Brian Singer did so well in \\"X-Men\\"), writer/director Mark Steven Johnson opts for a more schematic, episodic approach, yoking it all together with tenuous motivations and a ponderous explanatory voiceover. Perhaps aiming for a broader demographic than under-25 males, romance is over-emphasised at the expense of the edgier, darker undercurrents which could have been more interestingly explored. But maybe that wouldn't have helped. For me, there's always something a little silly about these comic book superheroes violently working through their childhood traumas. It works on the page, but on the screen it feels false: perhaps increased fidelity to visual reality demands the same at the emotional level. Ironically, without the antidote of much deliberate humour (used to great effect in \\"Spider-Man\\") we end up laughing anyway. As he so often is in other roles, Ben Affleck is spectacularly unconvincing as Murdock/Daredevil. Jennifer Garner makes an appealing heroine as Elektra, so it's a shame she won't be back. Colin Farrell as Bullseye finally gets to release the inner Irish wildman the tabloids keep telling us about, and is the only one who seems to be having fun. Michael Clarke Duncan booms his way through another scary-big-guy performance as the utterly superfluous villain (can anyone even remember what he wanted?). And John Favreau? I just pray he packed on the pounds for the role.emember what he wanted?). And John Favreau? I just pray he packed on the pounds for the role.

Charlie is NOT your stereotypical shoot-me-now teenager portrayed in most novels. He's real, a perfect representation of all the kids at your high school who DONT care about YM or MTV or Abercrombie. Charlie and his friends like the Smiths, Nirvana, and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. It was nice to read something real for once instead of the trash they force-feed you at the bookstores. Though he's definetly messed up, Charlie manages to get through things with a bittersweet desperation for things to be okay. <BR>Read this book, it's so worth it.

This album helps me relive those rare and fullfilling moments.<BR>There is no doubt that this girl has talent.  Norah Jones' smooth voice is one of the most relaxing and mood invoking I have heard in years.  Although not the same type of music, I find Norah Jones to be a female counterpart of Harry Connick Jr.  Great voice, great talent, great mood, great accompanyment, mediocre lyrics.  Despite this criticism, I have no choice but to highly recommend this album to anyone who wants a soothing and relaxing music listening experience.
B000058T5E|5.0|This CD grows on you after a while.  Jeff Beck is probably the only guitarist from the sixties whose playing has evolved on each release and who has kept up with the times.  Although Santana and Eric Clapton are still excellent players who manage to stay on the charts, their playing has stayed the same.
B00005MP58|5.0|For ''hard core'' Jane Austen fan's, this movie is very well done.  It's true that Elizabeth in this adaptation is a bit stuffy and was perfectly performed in the 40's version.  However, the screenplay, the script, and the surroundings were beautiful and more than made up for any little stuffiness.  The length of this movie was perfect, as you truly felt that you were watching the book unfold exactly as you had imagined it while reading it.  Colin Firth is the epitome of Mr. Darcy in this movie and I wouldn't have any one else play the part.  He captivated me from the start and made me despise him and love him at the same time.  He created quite a stir in America with this part and I can honestly say, stole my heart!  The other characters in the movie are in no way lacking and give the background support the way they were intended to, without taking away attention from Lizzy and Mr. Darcy.  I highly recommend this movie and intend to buy it myself.  I might as well as I have already rent it enough to have paid for three copies!

In my opinion, it fits Billy Corgan's voice better than any other music style does. The lyrics are probably their most meaningful on this album, too. You just sink into Adore. Songs like &quot;Ava Adore&quot;, &quot;Appels + Oranjes&quot;, and &quot;Pug&quot; make this album one of the best works by the Smashing Pumpkins. However, this one is definently more calm and relaxed than the other Pumpkins albums. It's hard to discribe the vibe that pours from Adore. I just love it. Get this album. Adore is definently something you'll never experience from any other band.

B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a film based on Mark Bowden's account of the events that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia on October 3rd 1993, when a number of Delta Force Soldiers and Army Rangers were on a mission to capture two of Warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid's top lieutenants. The initiative of the mission was lost when two Black Hawk Helicopters were shot down. As a result, what was only to be an hour's routine mission turned into a harrowing 15+ hour catastrophic fight for life, as the soldiers fought against thousands of Somali Militia to get to the crash sight, load the dead and wounded and get back to base. In the end, 19 US soldiers and hundreds of Somalis lost their lives.<br />Supported by a strong script, talented cast and a good director, Black Hawk Down is a successful protrayal of the events that took place that fateful day in October. Though a little biased in spots, the movie manages to steer clear of crediting the American soldiers as heros for all the wrong reasons, and largely acknowledges what happened that day as a major SNAFU. Ridley Scott is good at avoiding the terms \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" and instead maintains the movie's focus on the middle ground of the horror and sadness of war, and the comaraderie of the men fighting in it. Because the movie is filmed in Real Time, and once the battle starts it rarely stops, the characters might come across as poorly defined to some, but to me they were very rich. The sense of brotherhood amongst the actors in their roles is very apparent, and aides in comprehending the severity of the situation, and truly enforces the feeling behind the soldier's motto and the movie's tagline: Leave No Man Behind.<br />I would recommend this film for anyone interested in the True Story it's based on. I would however, advise that you read the excellent book by Mark Bowden first, as it makes the experience a little more three dimensional, and would surely answer any questions you might have concerning the situation. Be warned though, it's a relentlessly violent film that doesn't gloss anything over. People with an aversion to blood might find themselves a little uncomfortable. But if these things bother you not, you will find an intense, both in stunning visuals and storyline, well made movie. If you are the type who wants a good ol' war movie you can cheer at, this is not it. Black Hawk Down refuses to glamourizes the harsh reality of war, and at the end of it, instead of cheering, you'll most likely find yourself mourning instead.
B00006CXSS|5.0|What more can I say, Band of Brothers is historical and a must have in your collection.  I haven't seen any series so exciting as this one.  After seeing \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and many other war movies, I really enjoyed watching Band of Brothers in HBO and now in DVD.  I am a fanatic of the WWII, so this movie does make you understand many things about the historical events from last century.  The DVD comes with a lot of features that you cannot miss watching, from a step to step summary of each chapter to a WWII timeline, and many more.  <BR>I recommend this DVD Series to anyone who enjoys of great, great movies!
B000067CPX|2.0|First and foremost, this album is just so much different from the earlier peppers albums.  BSSM and BTW are so different from each other.  The Chilis have a kind of matured sound, but at the same time in my mind it is a bit bland compared to Californication and Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  If you haven't previously been a great fan of the Chili Peppers, you may yet like this one.
B00005B36H|5.0|I purchased Tool's most resent album Laterlus about a year ago and it has taken me that long to finally write a review for it because it took so long for me to really understand it. The whole CD is quite beutiful and one must dig very deep to understand it. Many of the songs do not even feature vocalist Maynard James Keenan. What I think is the best part of this album is how the band members really know how to use their instruments. Tool is not a teen band with angst and in some circles not even considered a metal band. It would take many months or years to fully clasify this interesting unit of musicians.<br />The Grudge-There is six or seven minutes of silence before the song really starts up. Maynard really shows his vocal talent on this song. In the begining he sounds like a robot, in the middle he sounds like himself and in the end he screams for about twenty seconds. Also Justin (bass) really shows off his talent in the begining of the song.<BR>Econ Blue Apocalyose-A quiet guitar piece.<BR>The Patient-Very quiet vocals, amazing.<BR>Mantra-I'm still confused about this one. There are no vocals but there is a somewhat weird sound in the background.<BR>Schism-This is the single(supposably). I do really enjoy this song. Many have labled Adam Jones' guitar work (which has influenced me in my playing) simplistic but after this song he has quieted the critics.<BR>Parabol-The intro the Parabola. Very quiet vocals. Very strange.<BR>Parabola-This song is my second favorite song on the whole CD. Awsome.<BR>Ticks and Leeches-The heaviest song on the whole album. Great drumming by Danny Carey.<BR>Laterulus-Great vocals and amazing guitars.<BR>Deposition-The begining of the trio of songs to follow.<BR>Reflection-The best song on the whole album. In the begining it sounds like an African chant but then moves on to a regular song. The longest on the album, about eleven minuets.<BR>Triad-I must say that this song has some of the best drumming in a song ever! No words.<BR>Faaipde Oiad-THis song is spoken word about how Area 51 has been invaded by aleins. Strange.<BR>This entire CD is a great work of art and will be praised for the rest of eternity. Tool are one of the greatest bands ever. Their art far surpases the music made by such top selling acts of today like Korn, Staind, Limp Bizkit, Crazy Town and Papa Roach. Some bands like Tool that you may enjoy are Mudvayne (not a nu-metal carbon copy), Mushroomhead and System of a Down. Keep an open mind while listening to this album and enjoy!
B000063DI9|5.0|There is no question that Seventh Son is a great, great album. Only The Good Die Young, Infinite Dreams, The Prophecy, etc. In fact, the only song I don't like is the title track. <br />Thinking back to Somewhere in Time, Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, and Powerslave (even Live after Death) - it truly is hard to come up with a favorite considering all the great songs on each of these albums...Certainly, an argument can be made that Seventh Son is right up there with any of them. However, this album marked a MAJOR turning point for the band because they were never able to come close to duplicating their genius after this album. No Prayer for the Dying, Fear of the Dark, Brave New World, etc, were so average and uninspiring that it is an insult to put the Iron Maiden logo on the CD. All good things must come to an end...
B00005N5S5|3.0|Not that good in my opinion. When I saw this movie back in 1990 I was blown away. But right now in 2000's, I viewed again and I can tell this movie is indeed made 19 years ago. My favorite part is still the car chase through Los Angeles. It's getting there, but still not great
B00006RINF|5.0|I don't know if I'd call Lacuna Coil goth metal but they're certainly not your average rock band. \\"Comalies\\" is their latest and is my first by them so I can't really compare this to their other albums but, whether it sounds different or not, this is definitely worth buying! For whatever reason samples are not available but once I got this in the mail as a gift and popped the disk into my CD player I was hooked for a very long time and just couldn't listen to anything else! Cristina Scabbia has a sheer, transcendent voice with incredible versatility. Even when she's rocking out with the boys, her singing remains ethereal and gorgeous. At first I didn't care for the male vocals of Andrea because he reminded me of the frontman to Metallica but his voice is really growing on me now and he doesn't annoy me at all. In fact, I think his voice compliments Cristina perfectly as they harmonize with the heavy guitar riffs and great percussion.<br />I recently purchased \\"Aegis\\" by Theatre Of Tragedy (another fabulous group signed to Century Media Records) and I find their sound similar to Lacuna Coil (they are bound to get compared to) so if you like TOT but want a more aggressive female vocalist without the growling and screaming of the male singer than Lacuna Coil's \\"Comalies\\" is the best CD for melodic metal fans! This may be my only album by Lacuna Coil but I already consider myself a huge aficionado!
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is one of the best action movies ever made. Considered it's made 12 years ago, this movie still look as modern as if it's made today. Lots of explosions, lots of shooting, and some car chases. Everything you wanted to look for in an action movie is here. Way better than the 1st Terminator
0441003257|5.0|...I have read Good Omens a good many times and have found it to be a wonderful ride. I actually need to purchase a new copy since I've about worn out my old one. This book is everything the movie Dogma wishes it could be. I highly recommend it.
B00005221L|3.0|This movie is okay, I don't why everybody say this is Arnie's best movie. The whole time Arnie and the monster are battling in the jungle is pretty tiresome. I would say the best part is Arnie's troop and the enemy's troop fighting, not the main monster battling part.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Audioslave is revolutionary.  Instead of pumping out more &quot;nu metal,&quot; the group writes beautiful poetry about nature set to a sound that resembles a loud Mamas &amp; Papas.  Slave's support of nature (especially forests and birds' rights to make a home where they please) is refreshing in our disposable culture.  Get this and understand!
6304602979|5.0|Very engaging and interesting movie. what I love about this film is that a lot of things happened and that made a movie explosive. I'm a big Gary Oldman fan, and it's good to see him here as a Jamaican pimp. Patricia is pretty as usual, better looking that her role in Lost Highway. Anyway, buy this movie you won't be disappointed
B00000DRDW|5.0|I used to see Bob Seger at several venues back in Michigan around 1969 and later.  I truely enjoyed him then as well as now.<br />The version of Bo-Diddley on here is the best I have heard.  Bob Seger never sang a song without pure unadulterated passion and this CD is no exception.  This CD is full of old hits, I bought my copy at a used CD store in Oak Ridge Tn and drove home with the windows down and thinking I was young again.  <br />Bo Diddley, If I was a Carpenter, Heavy Music and Turn on your love light will turn on some old memories for sure.  <br />Bob Seger.  The raw edge of old time rock and roll.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|I still like the first Blade better than this one. The second one has some dull moment, but slicker than the 1st one. But if you want me to compare the 2, I would say the first one is more original and creative
B000001ELP|3.0|KISS decided to stretch out and make a highbrow album when they came out with the \\"Elder\\" conceit. At the time, they were talking of a trilogy based on the boy's ride to power and an eventual movie based on the albums. That lasted about as long as it took for this record to die a miserable commercial death.<br />But for whatever perverse reason, \\"The Elder\\" has stayed in my CD collection where some of the other discs have been purged. Maybe it was their absolute belief that this teaming with Bob Ezrin would give them a Pink Floyd arena album, or the fact that \\"A World Without Heroes\\" is quite possibly the best song Gene Simmons has ever written. Or maybe the ridiculous chorale that swells up in \\"Fanfare.\\" Or that \\"I\\" is absolutely inspiring. No matter how you slice it, this is a crazy record for KISS and Ace hated it so much he quit the band afterwards.<br />After this, it was strictly meat and potatoes generic metal, so I gotta hand it to KISS for making \\"The Elder.\\" They never went this far over the top again.
1577311523|1.0|I bought this book with high hopes after reading all the glowing reviews, but I didn't find much to recommend it. It's a rehash of typical New Age doctrine in all its reality-contradicting, wishful-thinking, anti-white, anti-Western, I-must-be-enlightened-because-I-speak-on-such-a-high-level-you-can't-understand-me glory. I found it very off-putting and self-contradictory, and it completely doesn't match up with my experience of life. In my opinion, it ridiculously oversimplifies the human condition.  But here's what I really want to know: during the two years Mr. Tolle \\"sat on park benches in a state of bliss,\\" as he states early on in the book, with \\"no job,\\" what the hell did he do for food? Is he a trust fund baby? Did he hit the lottery? Was he independently wealthy long before that? Or was he eating out of dumpsters? Just this little chunk of the book cemented its lack of contact with the reality of most people's lives. And if you're not speaking to the reality of people's lives, you're only talking to your navel. In my opinion, your money is best spent elsewhere.
0060934913|4.0|Gives a great behind-the-scenes look at the world of professional cooking.  Also includes a wonderful section on best practices for eating out (i.e., don't touch fish at brunch on Sunday).  The author's style may be too much for the timid, but I found it enjoyably blunt, honest, and funny.  Bourdain should be proud for achieving what he set out to do:  Imbibe in the reader an appreciation for the dedication of the kitchen staff to deliver a quality product.
B00008DDXC|3.0|I know some people will disagree with what i have to say but thats what America is all about; freedom. The Harry Potter series in books is a GREAT series but i was really dissapointed with the first movie, my family needed to drag me to see the second. This movie was closer to the book than the first one and i wasn't as upset with it as i was with the first one. But there were certain scenes that they pulled that you needed to see to understand if you have never read the books(my father kept on asking me what was going on since he has never read the books). They did a really good job on the speacial effects and the cast did a really good job delivering their lines. But i think this will always happen with books that are made into movies, they add scenes that never happen in the book to apparently make it more exciting and suspenseful for those who have never read the books. So as i say in the title of this review \\"It could Have been better.\\"
B00003CXI0|5.0|In the last analysis, there is only one real plot: the clash between good and evil. Harry Potter and his friends  bring this fact home to us, and remind us that everyone, of every age, is caught up in the conflict.<BR>For this reviewer, it took the film \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" to make a connection  with the Potter phenomenon. I had read the book;  and while I was impressed by author J.K. Rowling's achievement in getting children to read I was only mildly impressed by the work itself. Then one day I was able to pop the movie into a vcr and magic happened.  And you can never get enough magic.<BR>(By the way, on a radio program not long ago I heard a film director describe the Harry Potter films as totally lacking in magic. People certainly are entitled to their opinions; but in this case I believe some sour grapes might well have been involved. After all, the man didn't get to direct either of the Potter films that have been issued to date.) <BR>I call numerous things about \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" magical. Not least is Daniel Radcliffe's perfornance as Harry. He is a very charismatic young actor, and it is hard to take your eyes off him. He combines an appealing sweetness with the toughness necessary to survive for a time when the Forces of Evil have a deep personal grudge against you. <BR>I would be very happy to recommend this film to anyone. Especially to children who can learn a great deal about the world through this well-crafted and entertaining story.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the coolest stuff I've listened to in a long time.
B00000055E|5.0|Any true Pac's fan will loves this album in the first time hear, it is hard for me to decided which one of the cd's is the best, cuz both of them are GREAT!!! But the one thing for sure is, this album is my third favourite after \\"Me Againts The<BR>World\\" & \\"All Eyes On Me\\". Although most of the songs in this album are remixes but they are still great, might be the reason for this, is because the original versions is too sloppy, so that's why its never appeared in the previous albums, and if it's so then this album is true definitions of Lost Tapes. Unlike the others Pac's posthomous album, this one is far from commercial approach. You don't have to worry about the new beats because it's still carrying the sounds of Pac's album before the Death Rows years. We should give a big props to Ricky Rouse who makes a magic touch for the most of songs with his excellent guitar plays, which not only great complement for the songs but also turns Pac's lyrics into vivid picture that you can see clearly like movie on the big screen. If you already have \\"Me Againts The World\\" & \\"All Eyes On Me\\", you must have this album or if you wanna start hearing Pac, this is not bad choice.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Eight weeks after he accidentally crashed on Isla Sorna, the Kirbys still have hope that their son has managed to survive. That's why they basically trick Dr. Alan Grant into an almost hopeless rescue mission. If you can get past this hard-to-believe premise, then you can enjoy \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" for what it is: a very expensive B-movie.<br />Despite being the only installment of the trilogy that's not directed by Steven Spielberg, \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" carries on the franchise proudly, and most important, effectively. For starters, it's an enormous pleasure to see Sam Neill (who had refused to return for the first sequel) back in the lead role. I have nothing against Jeff Goldblum, but with the possible exception of \\"The Fly\\", he just can't sustain a whole movie by himself. Sam Neill's character, on the other hand, is the right choice to go against a deadly pack of super-intelligent Velociraptors, the always lethal T-Rex and a new foe: one nasty Spinosaurus. Also, the flying Pteranodon, absent from the first two movies, finally has a chance to measure itself against the humans. With all these new dinosaurs, the over-the-top special effects, and enough action to go around and not get tiresome for 90 minutes, \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" almost surpasses (in my opinion) \\"The Lost World\\".<br />In the extras department, the movie really focuses on the special effects, mainly concerning the creation of the dinosaurs. Nothing new if you have seen the other two movies, but the dinosaur information and the excellent commentary by the SFX crew (including guru Stan Winston) will make it worth your while. The video and sound quality are top of the line, but that's almost a usual treat coming from Universal Studios releases.<br />Now, don't go looking for something too smart here. \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" is all about the fun, and the less cerebral you are, the better. I mean, sure, the plot is holey and some sequences are a bit corny (it's hard not to laugh when young Eric appears in his jungle camouflage outfit, or when Dr. Grant uses the world's weirdest harmonica to \\"charm\\" the raptors), but with an effective mix of action, humor and eye candy, \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" is just enough to prove that sequels aren't necessarily bad, as long as you keep it exciting.amouflage outfit, or when Dr. Grant uses the world's weirdest harmonica to \\"charm\\" the raptors), but with an effective mix of action, humor and eye candy, \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" is just enough to prove that sequels aren't necessarily bad, as long as you keep it exciting.
B00005NTN5|5.0|The Watchowski Bros. handcrafted this gem with cinematic bravado and touches of \\"bullet time\\" before anyone ever heard of the term.  If you want a movie that has a little David Mamet and touch of Christopher Nolan, \\"Bound\\" is it.  It's got smart and unexpected plot twists like Mamet's movies and awsome cinematography like Nolan's \\"Memento\\".  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat biting your fingernails.  Definitely a must have for movie lovers!
B000002H97|5.0|Metal purists and patrons of the '80s Metallica sound are, in my opinion, unjustly harsh on this album.  There is only one poor song on the entire album (\\"Holier Than Thou\\").  In the eyes of open-minded listeners such as myself, it retains full legitimacy as a metal album, and though it features a more commercial sound and less offensive lyrics (except in \\"The God That Failed\\") and features shorter songs, it is by no means a bad production.  Metallica was never in the game for the underground crowd, they wanted to make money, and this was the album that did it for them.  However, unlike current \\"metal\\" bands, the band did not \\"sell out\\" to achieve its fame, but instead, gave the public a masterpiece of musicianship that let everyone know what the genre was made of.<br />Fans of older Metallica definitely criticize the shortness of the tracks.  While Metallica did play some great songs that were quite lengthy, these could get a little tedious at times.  One of my personal favorites, \\"Don't Tread On Me,\\" is only four minutes long.  That would be an interlude by early Metallica standards.  Other great tracks are \\"Sad But True,\\" \\"The God That Failed\\" (musically, not conceptually or lyrically), \\"The Unforgiven,\\" and \\"My Friend of Misery.\\"  \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is a nice ballad, but takes too long to get into.  The other tracks, except \\"Holier Than Thou\\" and \\"The Struggle Within\\" are above-average.  My only real complaint with this is that Lars' drumming doesn't really stand out on many of the songs.<br />In the end, Metallica deserved all the credit they got for this one.  If you don't like it, then you're perfectly entitled to your opinion.  But if you're just senselessly bashing it simply because Metallica matured and changed, then you need to start speaking your own mind and stop trying to appease the purists.
0316666343|5.0|I picked The Lovely Bones up at the library -- hesitantly -- because although I'd heard good things about it, I was wary of reading an account of a young girl's torture and murder. This book is not that, but more an account of how precious life is, and how loss and recovery is all part of living.<br />From the opening pages, I was totally consumed by this novel, enchanted by the spirit, pain, and wisdom of Susie and her grieving family. I have never before read such a realistic account of grief and mourning. Every character displayed true emotions and processed the unthinkable in their own way. Alice Sebold's rendering of heaven also touched me deeply; I've always believed that each of us will create our own personal heaven.<br />The final chapters get a little trippy, but stick with it... you will not be disappointed, and I have a feeling you'll be tremendously moved. This book left me more appreciative of my own time on earth, more in touch with my own emotions about death, and more grateful for the people who love me and for the people I love.
B00006DEFA|5.0|AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT     (USA - 1984/2001)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)  Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital    Many years after the death of Mozart (Tom Hulce), aged and embittered court composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) relates to a disbelieving priest the story of his obsession with Mozart's musical genius and how it led to jealousy, betrayal, and possibly even murder...    Sumptuous evocation of a time and place, using Mozart's glorious music both to propel the story and underline the emotional dynamics of Peter Shaffer's extraordinary script. Based on his well-received stage play, and completely reworked for the screen, AMADEUS (1984) - and its updated version, reviewed here as AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT, released in 2001 - portrays Mozart's world as a romantic marriage of Royal palaces and candle-lit garrets, populated by eccentric emperors and their devious, toadying lackeys.     The composer himself is played by Hulce as a spoiled, egotistical brat who indulges his passion for earthly pleasures with all the enthusiasm he brings to his musical compositions. But the film is anchored by Abraham in an Oscar-winning turn as Mozart's nemesis Salieri, consumed by envy and hatred whilst simultaneously awed by his rival's genius, the genius which Salieri had wished for himself, only to be denied by a mischievous God. The scenes in his asylum cell - where the elder Salieri confesses his 'crime' to a naive priest (Richard Frank) - are a tour de force, played with an intensity that simply burns up the screen.     Beautifully designed and photographed, and bolstered by a magnificent supporting cast (including Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow and Kenneth McMillan in a role completely excised from the original theatrical print), the movie unfolds like an operatic melodrama which builds to a shattering climax, as the two central characters reach an understanding (of sorts) during the writing of Mozart's 'Requiem', only to be divided forever by an unexpected tragedy. A masterpiece.    NB. Incredibly, the MPAA has given the film an R rating for a brief sequence in which a female character bares her breasts to the camera. Surely this kind of sexual squeamishness belongs to the Dark Ages, not the 21st century?! There's nothing here which warrants anything more than a PG-13.
0060005424|5.0|The setting of this book is in the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre, from the fourteenth to the eighteenth year of the restoration of the reign of King Touchstone I.  Many of the places introduced in Sabriel, the first book in the series, are revisited, including the Abhorsen's house and the river Ratterlin.  The two main characters in the book are Lirael and Prince Sameth, the son of King Touchstone and Sabriel.  He is expected to take up the profession of his mother, an Abhorsen, protecting the Old Kingdom from the dead and their servants. However, Sameth can't even bring himself to open the book Sabriel has given him to study, The Book of the Dead.  Just thinking about Death makes him shudder.  How will he ever become the Abhorsen, whose daily occupation is to go into Death?  Every morning Lirael says,  \\"No mother, no father, no Sight.\\" These are the words that she hopes to one day say, \\"No mother, no father, but I have the Sight.\\"  Lirael is an orphan that lives in the Clayr's Glacier. At fourteen Lirael has yet to receive the Sight, the gift of seeing glimpses of the future, which each Clayr has.  Most Clayr Lirael's age already have the Sight, but Lirael still wears the blue tunic of a Sightless Clayr.  This is the story of Lirael's destiny, one that will take her away from the glacier and all she has ever known.  In this story Garth Nix shows what you expect in life doesn't always happen.  Sometimes it does happen, but in a different way than what you expected.  Being prepared and ready to accept anything is a good philosophy in life. For example, take Lirael's life; things don't always go as she expects or hopes, but she is ready to accept the changes and make the best of things, even when it means that she has to change her life's goal.  We can take Lirael's example and apply it to our own lives. Are we ready for anything to happen? Are we ready to accept the things that do happen?  I completely loved this book, partly because it was the sequel to a great bookI had read two years ago, but mostly because it has just the right mix of magic, suspense, and perfect character development.  I am a great fan of magic books and authors who develop their characters well. This is the third book by Garth Nix I have read, and now, I'm a fan for life!  The only things I disliked about the book were the facts that it was way too short, and it took Mr. Nix an excessively long time to write it.I think that this book is definitely worth reading.  The plot is well thought-up, the characters are perfectly drawn, and all expectations gathered from the previous novel are met.   If you like books with magic, or you have read Sabriel or Shade's Children and liked them this is a must-read for you! If this is the first book by Garth Nix you are reading, I suggest you read Sabriel first because it is the prequel to Lirael.

0060920386|5.0|For starters I would like to say that I saw the movie of the same title (several times - but I like James Garner) before I read the book.  The movie is a comedy which successfully captures the spirit of this book, but this book is not a comedy.<br />The authors do an excellent job of developing the characters by telling how they rose to their respective positions at this focal point, and telling the story as it unfolds.<br />It is like all of the worst traits of humanity - greed, ego, pride, vanity, a hunger for power and conquest and victory - are played out in this true story of the LBO (Leveraged BuyOut) of RJR Nabisco.  Companies being tossed around like commodities, while the little guy who works hard to make a living suffers.<br />This is the only book I have read on this subject to date.  Some of the other reviewers have suggested other titles, and many of them are probably worth reading as well.<br />Five stars.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I have always felt that \\"No Doubt\\" was a almost but not quite band. \\"Return to Saturn\\" was a huge progression for them I thought. And then came \\"Rock Steady\\" a masterpiece! This cd is tight to Def! It has your rock/techno influenced tracks. Then you got great producers like Prince (The greatest)/Nelle Hooper(Madonna & Massive Attack)/William Orbit(Madonna). This album is a combo with some thing extra. You have Reggie influenced tracks and Catchy Beats, What more can you ask for? This is a sexy album in my opinion. It has some real tight cuising beats to ride to. This is a progression and a huge successful step for the band I love it. \\"Making out\\" Produced by William Orbit is such a sexy and tight record. The Prince produced \\"Waiting Room\\" is as sleezy as ever. This is the album Gwen deserves to ignite her sex appeal. I can actually feel the songs on this record it is like she is singing to me. Well, she has been compared to Madonna in the past I think she is finally showing the innovation that Madonna has conveyed. On \\"Rock steady\\" she worked with 3 people Madonna has worked with what do you think? Get this it is the most solid effort they ever done. \\"Tragic Kingdom other than the singles was very disappointing I thought. I don't own anything before that. But I love the this and the one before it. But this is argueably the most satifying don't sleep get this. I hate to say this but this ablum reminds me alot of Prince,I wish he would do another Fun album.<br />Arish
B00006F2TV|5.0|The movie-theatre adaptation of the Spider Man franchise went through years of failed plot attempts and numerous legal battles to materialize but despite all of the obstacles, it would absolutely succeed by getting praising reviews from both critics and movie-goers alike and it definitely deserved all of that and I would like to add my share of praise to \\"Spider Man\\". This movie is unbelievably great. (DANGER: THERE COULD BE POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD BUT HOPEFULLY NOT.)<br />Tobey McGuire was on the border of being perfect for the role of playing the 'nerdy', bumbling, yet intelligent and caring student Peter Parker who gains new abilities after being bitten and genetically altered by a genetically engineered spider and also gains 'spider like senses' that warn him of approaching danger. He tries to keep them under wraps until one fateful night when his uncle Ben Parker is murdered in a carjacking that he failed to stop and vowed to get his revenge for his uncle's murder by fighting for justice and apprehending criminals. However it becomes a chaotic juggling circus as he juggles being a superhero, fighting crime and upholding the law, working as a newspaper editor for his disgruntled employer J. Jonah Jameson, who seems to hate Spider-Man with a passion, and also trying to win the love of Mary Jane Watson who is in love with Parker's best friend Harry Osborn, who is the son of company CEO, Norman Osborn. I couldn't imagine how he manages all three of these burdens and how much sleep that Mr. Parker loses over time but as they say \\"With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility\\".<br />Norman, in this movie is, experimenting with a new genetically altering chemical lab but something goes wrong and genetically enhances his genetic makeup and turns him into a monstrous new character who eventually becomes the ever feared Green Goblin while remaining a human but with new powers but goes mad over his company Oscorp being threatened with being shut down by government officials and he goes into defiance of them but yet also threatens the safety of the citizens of New York in the process and Spider Man now has to go head to head against him and protect the public from his malice. William Dafoe definitely shows the pure evil expressions yet the internal vulnerabilities of Norman Osborn.<br />Quite frankly, I love the choice of the actors who were selected to play the characters. Tobey McGuire as I said before was on the border of being perfect for the role of Peter Parker/Spider Man as McGuire brings out the somewhat 'nerdiness' but yet also the intelligence and the vulnerability of Parker's character and also the intelligence and the agility of Spider Man. Even the costume was almost spot-on and not overdone like some of those in \\"X-Men\\" and in the 1997 flop \\"Batman & Robin\\". Kristen Dunst filling in the role as Mary Jane Watson was absolutely unforgettable and showed the incredible beauty and the intelligence of Watson. My favorite though was the villainous role of William Dafoe playing the ever so frightening Green Goblin and the schizoid Norman Osborn. Then there are some relatively overlooked but unforgettable characters like the high school ruffian bully Flash Thompson. I actually loved watching the fighting scene between Parker and Thompson and its hilarious outcome. I feel that this movie was the best comic book adaptation in many years, if not of all time and none of the characters were dumbed down to one-dimensional characters.<br />There are some interesting messages of how such great power and control also come with the need for great responsibility and it really is something to think about and I feel that those messages combined with fun action scenes in \\"Spider Man\\" make it a marvelous movie that is definitely miles above a lot of similar superhero movies or weak superhero movie additions that are sunk down by the MTV-oriented sequences, most notably \\"Batman & Robin\\". I think that this movie while occasionally flawed in some areas, \\"Spider-Man\\" was much better adapted to the big screen than the X-Men movie was. Unlike some of the characters of that great movie like Storm, Rogue, and Cyclops who I feel were reduced to middle of the road characters, the characters of \\"Spider Man\\" almost are as engaging and as great as their comic book incarnations and not since the 1989 \\"Batman\\" movie has a superhero comic and it's villains been so well adapted to the silver screen and that my friend is the definition of smart timing, great script and a movie that is destined to become a classic for many years to come, if not timeless. I just hope that the \\"Spider-Man\\" movie franchise will go for a long time and not be soiled into MTV oblivion like the Batman series was with \\"Batman & Robin\\". Let's just make sure that Joel Schumacher stays far away from this franchise.<br />Let's just say that while these past few years have been dull and sometimes awful for music, they've also been great years for movies. Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Shrek, Monsters Inc......you name it. \\"Spider Man\\" took as long as a decade to finally bring to the big screen but it all paid off though. While this movie might have some room for improvement, \\"Spider Man\\" is about as great as comic book movie filmmaking gets with its fun atmosphere and eye-popping action sequences and wonderful script and all of these things bring this movie to life. Let me tell you, I haven't seen any comic book characters that were brought to so much life on the big screen in my life. While I'm not knocking on the \\"X-Men\\" movie at all, \\"Spider-Man\\" was better filmed and the costumes were great and not overdone like some of the characters. Despite all of the negative flaws of both of these two movies, they are both classics and make a great action movie combo! Both make great compliments, \\"Spider-Man\\" having a fun and colorful mood yet dark atmosphere while \\"X-Men\\" has a darker and much more dramatic atmosphere and these two are great movies to include side by side. Perhaps they should eventually put together a movie where \\"Spider Man\\" meets the \\"X-Men\\" and they battle a Magneto-Dr. Octopus alliance. Now that would be awesome! Enough of all of that, \\"Spider Man\\" is a must-have addition to any movie-goers movie collection. I may be wrong but it might be difficult in my opinion for the second Spider Man movie to surpass this one but time will tell though. Go and buy it!

B000067CPX|5.0|This has got to be one of the most beautiful works from the Chili Pepper's. These guys have a great sensibility for making mellow interesting, groovin rock tunes. After hearing \\"Californication\\" I was hooked! Flea's bass is just amazing and the way they convey their transitions. I would have to say these guys will be sampled from Hip Hopper's years to come. There grooves are so soulful and groovin you can almost rap off some of them. \\"By the way\\" has a track on it called \\"This is the Place\\" Man, that is the [stuff!] The bass just thumps like a rap song or something. All the tracks on here are beautifully composed. I just love everything about this album even the guitar riffs are soulful and tight! These guys just reak creativity. They play rock the way it is supposed to be played with soul. I loved \\"Californication (The Song)\\" the guitar riff in that was amazing as well! If you are a fan of Mellow soulful rock with some tight grooves this is the one to invest in. These boys came with it like they did on Californication. It's sad all of our soft rock Icons have vanished where is Mazzy Star, Sarah Mcglalan? Keep real rock alive, you guys are great!<br />A+ for the ORIGINAL & ONLY \\"Hip Hop Rock Band\\" <BR>Arish
B00005YW4H|5.0|I AM A 40 SOMETHING YEAR OLD WIFE AND MOTHER OF 2 TEENAGERS AND AM BOMBARDED WITH TODAYS MUSIC AT HOME AND AT WORK. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS CD, I WAS ALONE AND WHEN SHE BEGAN HER FIRST SONG &quot; COME AWAY WITH ME&quot;, I WAS SO IMPRESSED, I BECAME TOTALLY STRESS FREE. IT IS RELAXING AND FEEL GOOD MUSIC. I ONLY WISH THERE WERE MORE SONGS LIKE THE FIRST ONE. DONT GET ME WRONG, THEY ARE ALL GOOD, BUT &quot;COME AWAY WTH ME&quot; IS SO SOOTHING! HER MUSIC FILLS YOUR SOUL AND MELTS AWAY EVERYTHING ELSE UNTIL THE CD ENDS. I HOPE SHE KEEPS UP THE SAME MANNER AND STYLE IN HER FUTURE CD'S AS SHE DID THIS ONE.TODAYS MUSIC IS EITHER TOO VULGAR,TOO FAST OR CAN'T UNDERSTAND. SHE IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT CD!
B00005RFAI|5.0|After hearing the debut I was a bit concerned but not anymore. She has always been super sexy to me and I felt she could really sing. But I was blown away after hearing this lp! Man, with tracks like \\"Don't Let me get me & Just like a Pill\\" this is some tight material. \\"Get the Party started\\" was an anthem and \\"18 Wheeler\\" is reminisent of Don't Let me get Me. \\"Family Portrait got Dr Dre's signature all on it. Last but not least my favorite \\"Dear Diary\\" Oh My... ! That guitar and track is so sexy and creative. This is the [stuff!} Don't Sleep on this cd at all! Just as \\"NO DOUBT\\" reserrected themselves she has done the same. I am thankful to hear creative artist like this in the game. The record labels are really hard on creativity these days all they want is simplicity. Well the Pink (Debut) which was 50% decent & 50% Junk has been out classed! Well, when you have \\"Dallas Austin (TLC's Producer)\\" on your cd how can you go wrong? You guys make a great team please work together again, can't wait for the next.<br />Arish
B00003CXXM|5.0|This movie was a constant brain stimulator. You were along for the ride trying to find out who he was and who was enemy and who was friend.  Matt Damon has the talent to carry this remake of the old movie. After seeing the movie I had to go home and dig out the book for a reread. the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole movie.
B00005OCMR|5.0|This is my favorite movie, but the dvd isn't amazing. I was a little dissapointed, but I still think it's a great buy.
0805066691|5.0|The victor writes the history, and in the process romantices it and distorts it.  This book gives us real history unencumbered by political correctness.  Thankyou Mr. Brown.  This book is hard to read at times, but the knowledge you gain is well worth the heartbreak.  In response to the review from Denver, if this book offends your dim sensibilities, try reading In The Spirit Of Crazy Horse by Matthiessen.  Next time try to proofread your review for typos and grammar.
B000002INR|5.0|As I purchased this album, I wondered what other songs were on here besides \\"18 and Life\\", but as I listened to the first song (Big Guns), I was blown away. The other songs are equally good, most notably \\"Can't Stand The Heartache\\", \\"Sweet Little Sister\\", and the chorus from \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" will have you singing it over and over inside your head for a while after you listen to it. That's simply a song that \\"stays with you\\". Unlike some other releases from this time period, I feel that the overall time period can be captured inside this record. The care-free riffing is exceptionally great, while the vocals are classically-contained inside also. And while sometimes the songs may become a bit cliche, you have to keep in mind that this album was cut at a time when that was the only thing sang about. Overall, it's a nice CD to have, and it's also one of those CD's you'll find yourself listening to over and over again, whether it's to hear a great ballad (18 and Life), or to jam to an upbeat song (Youth Gone Wild). Needless to say, I think this album captures what the band can do, and it truly captured it well. I gave this CD a 5-star rating due to it's production (great acoustic sound, mixed with driving bass sound), and it's great selection of songs (something here for everybody, it's safe to say).

B000066NW0|5.0|Good-bye Brittany, hello Avril! Brittany Spears is old news now. But the best Cd and singer on earth is definitally Avril Lavigne! Avril is just like me, a tomboy who does only what she wants and dresses up the way she wants. This CD will have you thinking only about Avril for a while. These songs are so great I listen to them 5 times in a row each! When the CD is done, I play the whole CD again. If Avril is reading my review i have one thing to say, THIS IS THE ONLY CD FOR ME! DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THOSE OTHER WORTHLESS JUNKY CD'S, BUT SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY ON EVERYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH AVRIL LAVIGNE. THIS CD WILL ENTERTAIN YOU FOR FOREVER! FORGET ABOUT &quot;BORING BRITTANY&quot; AND START DOING EVERYTHING &quot;AVRIL STYLE&quot; THIS IS DEFINITALLY THE CD OF THE CENTURY!
B000002B7V|5.0|Jake E. Lee has to be one of the top guitarists in the world.  The way this album was written for guitar is just undescribable. Any pro musician would know, pulling off Jake E. Lee live is a feat in itself, no false chords or BS. I am talking true reproduction, note for note.  Jake's riffs can be a challenge from hell!  Even Yngwie Malmsteen agrees, Jake is a monster!  The one song that really stands out technically is Never. From the opening staggering broken time riff to the monster solo. and that's just one of the songs!!  This album will always get 5 stars, I don't care what any lamer musican hack says!!
B00008DDXL|5.0|I, as many other Harry Potter Fans, greatly anticipate the arrival of the 5th book, \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix\\"(I believe I spelled that correctly). Many also are waiting to get their hands on the upcoming release of the 2nd movie, \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\"(count me in, I ordered it a month ago...), and I think that it was a spectacular film.<BR>   <BR>   Many people have complained about the flow of the movie, and I somewhat agree with them, the movie goes slow at some points, but what movie doesn't? Anyways, IF you get bored, you can listen to the background music and look at angles/places you hadn't taken notice to before.<br />    All the characters fit perfectly with the book, and I applaud the filmmakers for getting them all together. The main action shots were exciting, while the last one was a tad under this movie. Daniel, Emma, and Rupert (Harry, Hermione, and Ron) work together nicely, and also Draco and Harry are still bickering as usual :).<br />    Overall, I give this movie, oh, say, 97%-<BR>                          Out of 20%        Out of 100%<BR>              Action         19%                95%<BR>              Characters     22%                110%<BR>              Screenplay     19%                95%<BR>              Movement       18%                90%<BR>              Music          19%                95%<BR>                               OR<BR>                         4 4/5 stars

0066620996|4.0|The book was centred on a research project to identify good-to-great companies (among Fortune 500) and their success factors. The research methodology was sound, while not too complicated to understand. There were good cases as examples, from both good-to-great examples and comparisons. These made the ideas and findings more convincing -  although some of them may just ¡§common sense¡¨ to you. <br />Author did a good job to conceptualize the findings. He raised some  challenges to nowadays business norms. The book is easy to read. <br />But one can¡¦t help questioning: are there really golden rules to be successful in the diverse and dynamic world ?  Besides, it is easy to talk, but hard to do with these so-called ¡§golden rules¡¨.   The author did too much preaching in the last part of the book to hard sell his ¡§Built-to-Last¡¨ and ¡§Great-to-Good¡¨ principles.
B000089RVX|4.0|Most of you have probably heard the single from the Daredevil soundtrack, and basically if you like it, you'll like this entire CD.  Don't get me as saying it's all the same though, because there is a great variety in this CD-from heavy metal to acoustic piano tracks.  I personally find this very refreshing, it's a great blend of heavy metal, and a female voice, and a VERY good female voice at that.  Amy Lee has an incredible voice, and it's not a fake studio produced voice, this is really what she sounds like.  I really enjoy this CD, and I strongly encourage you to check it out.  One thing I also like is that the music is \\"big\\" music, in other words, lots of sound, with string sections, produced backgrounds, and heavy metal guitar, it is very powerful(and it sounds great in a good stereo!).<br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars, and this may just be me, is that on a few of the songs, the guitars are so deep and powerful they just don't seem to match Amy Lee's voice, and I'd also like to see a few more guitar solos.<br />This is a really great band, and I really am looking forward to their future work.
0767817443|1.0|This movie is a disgrace to the Godzilla name.  I was so stoked when I saw the first preview of it. but it turned out the preview was the best thing about the movie.  Essentially, the filmmakers took all that was appealing about Godzilla in the first place (i.e. near-indestructibility, godlike-fearsomeness, radioactive breath) and chucked it out the window in favor of a more \\"modern\\" approach.  Which may have looked great on paper, and even in film clips, but all the special effects in the world can't disguise the fact that the filmmakers TURNED GODZILLA INTO A GIANT CHICKEN!!!!!!!  I mean, for crying out loud, he does nothing but run away for most of the time he's on camera.  He is not threatening, he is not fearsome, and he certainly does not evoke the spirit of the Godzilla of old.  I sure didn't give a damn about what happened to any of the characters in the film, as their reactions were more like riding a roller coaster that if a fearsome monster were about to devour them.  The filmmakers had to attempt to inject a little more menace by introducing a ludicrous plot about the big-G being an egg-producing machine, I suppose to bring the horror to a more \\"personal\\" level, but all they ended up doing was ripping off Jurassic Park.  And the ending was a travesty.  C'mon, the Godzilla I know would have knocked those jet fighters right out of the sky and dared the millitary to send more!  Sadly, this isn't the Godzilla I knew and loved, but a coporate lackey whom was altered in an attempt to please the majority of the movie-going public.  This could have easily been the G-movie to end all G-movies.  Sadly, Godzilla will have to work long and hard to erase those images of him running pell-mell through the city to escape the threat of helicopters a fraction of his size.  A giant chicken indeed.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Don't try to figure anything out for awhile.  Do what us Americans have so much trouble doing...just go along for the ride for a bit, don't try to &quot;make&quot; this movie into anything.  It will converge...I promise!<br />Allow your mind to absorb, disagree, agree, digest, conjest, injest...just ALLOW.<br />All that applies to not only the subject matter, but the manner in which its subjected.  When it comes to the sometimes bumpy, sea-sick quality to the animation, be patient; it will become smooth sailing soon (and you won't even notice at which exact point it happens!).
B000089RVX|4.0|Amy Lee's voice is what sets this band apart from most metal bands.  Her range is similar to Aimee Mann (Til Tuesday) and her brooding tone reminds me of Shirley Manson (Garbage).  The chorus of the 2nd track &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; will stay with you long after you listen to it.  Her soaring harmonies play off a rap-like vocal line for a unique sound.  It works.  The other cuts are also very listenable, in particular &quot;Going Under&quot; which rocks, with a killer chorus.  This girl has range and has created some great layering harmonies that work well against the hard driving stuff the band creates.

B00006AVRK|5.0|My husband is British and we both loved these guys in Blackadder, so when we saw this set available he recommended I get it (he'd seen the original broadcasts of it).  Well, between the time I ordered and the time we watched the first one, he hyped it so much as \\"hysterical\\" and so on, that I was rather disappointed in the first show.  It was \\"interesting\\" and \\"amusing\\" but I would not have called it \\"hysterical.\\"  There were a few funny jokes but otherwise just an interesting show to watch.  <br />However, as we went on watching them, I got more in tune with it, and by Episode 5 I was loving it.  Bertie and Jeeves both use such wonderful hat words and Bertie does use the most alarmingly British phrases!  So, I'm looking forward to the rest of it.  Perhaps they were merely getting into stride in the first few shows.<br />The one drawback to this is that the actors changed every once in a while.  There was a character named Madeleine Basset and she was played by three different actresses over the course of this series.  There are other characters who were treated similarly; Gussie Fink-Nottle is played by 2 different guys (sadly) and J. Washburn Stoker was played by a couple of different guys too.  But the stories are worth it, as long as you don't get too caught up in this.  I spent a lot of time when they introduced new actors or actresses trying to figure out who they were playing, and then when I found out it was an actor change, spent a lot of time griping about it.  But since I had it on DVD I was able to go back and watch it from the beginning after this was all clear in my head.
B00005JLSE|5.0|The title of this review is no exaggeration this movie was truly amazing. While it highlighted the musical and dancing talents of its stars not just one person in this movie shined they all did. This movie based on the Broadway musical is better than the musical ever was. This movie was able to take the vision that the writer had and bring it to life in a way that the musical never could. It was able to clearly separate reality from fantasy with dazzling dance numbers, fantastic music terrifically performed by the stars. This movie is one of the best movies we have seen in years and it is not even in the same league of alot of the dribble that Hollywood has been subjucting to us. Even if you hate musicals go to this movie just to see the cell block tango, it was amazing. If this movie does not sweep the Oscars then the Oscars have some serious explaining to do. And Richard Gere Should have been nominated for an Oscar as well he was excellent.

Yann Martel had created a simple story which made me beg for more.  It is one of the tales that kept you wanting to know what was going to happen next and made me feel sad when the story ended.<br />You will marvel at the adventures that Pi had at sea; how he trained the tiger, how he found food for both of them and a most interesting stopover at a little island with lots of algae.<br />Just where did Pi end up?

B000060P79|4.0|wow, what a rad cd, really, i havent heard such good stuff in awhile, i do have complaints though.  there just seems to be the same recurring theme throughout all the songs, a bit too teenage angstish, but still really good, and track number 8, honestly, WTF, who writes about being in love with an alien, that's the dumbest song ive EVER heard, other than that one song, the cd is really good, ive been listening to simple plan for awhile now, and i'd recommend it to anyone
B0000029GA|5.0|There is nothing I can say on this album that hasn't been said before. This is a classic, that's all there is to it. No matter how many (or should I say how few) detractors this album has (like many classics in any art form and any genre), this album stands on the top of the pile of an Everest of hip hop albums along with a very select few.<br />If your young and your first experience of Nas was through Stillmatic or anything other than Illmatic (except for his cameo on Mobb Deep's and Raekwon's 1995 albums where Nas still had that illmatic in him), you'll find a very different artist then the Mafioso in It Was Written and the Firm, the mixed and confused artist of I Am and Nastradamus, or the reformed and angry rapper that was Nas in Stillmatic and God's Son.  This is Nas at his best, he was less mature but nonetheless more interesting.  His flow and the way he rides a beat is unsurpassed even today. Simply said: That [entertainer] has Soul!
B00005JKZT|5.0|If you are a Tolkien fan, you will add this film to your favorites list!  I don't think anyone could have made this film better than Peter Jackson - as politically correct to Tolkien standards as possible.  The book, The Two Towers, was the least interesting in the series but not the movie.  Jackson rounded the story out by including information from The Simirilian and from Tolkien's Appendices that, if otherwise left out of the movie would have left gaps in the overall adaption.  I found it rivoting - enough to see it 3 times at the theatre.  <br />Since Tolkien's ring trilogy is second only to the Bible in  literary popularity, and since you are reading this review, you will no doubt also injoy the movie.
B000002B1M|4.0|As an album of the year back in 1996, this album had stiff competition, Jay-Z's superb Reasonable Doubt, The Fugee's mastodont breakthrough: The Score, Outkast's ATLiens, Redman's Muddy Waters, Ghostface Killah's Ironman and 2Pac's records All Eyes on Me and The 7 Day Theory.  But what this album had agains't him, is that at the end of the first listen it all seemed like a step down from Nas for you see, with Illmatic, Nas set the standards for what a classic album should be.<br />But through time (and maybe because the lack of quality of subsequent hip hop albums) this album would resurface as a hip hop favorite, especially to Nas' fan.  Some even say that it is better than Illmatic.  I say blasphemy but that's just me.<br />This album is actually a step up musically, but is that a good thing? The rawness is gone, its more polished and more melodic.  That doesn't mean that the hardness is out. But Nas is more introspective now and he seems to have grown up.  <br />All in all, it is one of the best Nas album out there and one of the best in hip hop, this isn't however a revolutionary album like Illmatic and its contemporaries.  To me, It Was Written feels like a more commercial version of Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... by Raekwon.
B00008BXJF|5.0|If there has been one consistancy over the past 34 years of King Crimson's erratic career, it has been this: Amazing, and relevant music. So many bands that have been around since the late 60's, appear to be mostly still around for the bread and butter, and the massively publicized, and sometimes shameless cash in tours. King Crimson is a band that makes music because they love music. This album is an incredible blend of some of my favorite aspects of Crimson's music. Stunning instrumentals, with some very technical and exciting guitar work, as well as very solid song writing. This album is a mini-opera of classic prog and guitar-synth heaven. I still miss the line up of 95, the double trio, but Belew, Fripp, Mastelotto, and Gunn certainly do their best at what they are best at. Making freaking great music!!! I highly recommend this to anyone who even remotely considers themselves a Crimson fan. One of their greatest albums ever.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Where can I start.  First of all, \\"Don't Know Why\\" is the best song on this album.  The rest of the songs blend into what seems to be the same repeated chords and lyrics.  There is way better talent out there, and Norah got the Grammy's left and right, while that may be the case, I'm sure she cannot top her success with her next album.  It's a good album, but she is totally copying Natalie Merchant.  The piano, the looks, the shyness, etc.  Just my heartfelt feeling.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This is probably the finest Turandot in the books. <br />I don't think that the negative amateur reviewer of Dame Joan actually heard this recording. True, she never sang the role on stage. But did you know that she was primed to be a wagnarian soprano before her husband &quot;discovered&quot; her bel canto abilities and redirected her to the music of Bellini, Donizetti, and Rossini. And the rest is history.<br />To spell it out, Dame Joan had a huge voice when she was in her prime when this Turandot was made. And to compliment the large voice, it is warm, velvety, beautiful, and unbelievably even. All very rare for a coloratura soprano in any era. Furthermore, she sings not one wobble or sour note here. She just soars over the orchestra. And incidently, the high C in In Questa Reggia is the most powerful and dead center note of all the Turandots I have in my Turandot collection. And my collection includes the Nilsson/Bjoeling, studio Nilsson/Corelli, live Nilsson/Corelli and  Caballe/Carreres. So the person who claims that Sutherland top notes are weak surely had never heard this recording. To prove it, listen for yourself. If Sutherland's Turandot sounds small then so does Nilsson, or Callas. Yes, Nilsson is a true Turandot, but on records, she is not as convincing or mesmerizing as Dame Joan.<br />As for Pavarotti, he is always a joy for the ear. He is better than Bjoeling but not Corelli. Corelli is in a class of his own as Calaf. He has a thrilling voice that has high notes that he hangs on and on and on. That's why to many opera buff, he is the king of tenors(Corelli).<br />Caballe had the potential to be the quintessential Liu. She sings beautifully, but I think she overused the pianissimo that she is famous for. I prefer Renata Scotto's Liu because she simply breaks your heart with her phrasing and pathos. And in the 1966 recording, Scotto's voice is very nearly the loveliness of the great Renata Tebaldi, who is my second favorite Liu.<br />Overall, with themost realistic sound quality of any recording of that time period(1970?), this is certainly one of the finest Turandot if not the best. But, yes, get the Nilsson/Corelli/Scotto one too, which is also outstanding.
B00005JLWN|4.0|For those who werent fortunate to read these classics, i suggest you do, and then watch such a great moive as \\"Equilibrium\\".  Its a perfect reason why \\"utopian\\" societies fail, because the idea of reason and thought...  It is the definition of the color blue - to a blind person.  It is the defining moment of a song to a deaf person... It is the reason why we are what we are, who we are, and what we are to become.
B000069HK2|2.0|Nope, not too good. They'll fall of the face of the earth soon enough.
6304698798|5.0|The Good, The Bad and the Ugly in my opinion is the best among the trilogy.  Sporting the largest budget and the best script among \\"The Man With No Name\\" trilogy, this movie blazes across the screen brilliantly.  Of course, Clint Eastwood is back and his name is Joe once again although I don't believe you ever hear him referred to as anything other than Blondie.  Lee Van Cleef is back as well and he most definitely performs memorably as one of the bad guys.  Eli Wallach's performance as the pseudo bad/good guy Tuco is nothing short of spectacular.  The style and class of this movie is dead on with Sergio Leone's film making, making it a classic in the genre and one of the top films of the sixties.  The entire film comes off as a box office success and a treasure for your home DVD collection!<br />The premise:<br />Clint Eastwood is back as Joe/Blondie - The Good guy.  Eli Wallach shows up as Tuco - The Bad guy and Lee Van Cleef makes a return as Stenza the Ugly guy.  The film starts wonderfully by deftly making the introductions of the three primary characters doing what they do best.  Blondie ends up capturing Tuco and they make a comical deal.  Stenza makes a dramatic first appearance as well.<br />Blondie and Tuco have a dramatic parting of the ways that also brings them back together in classic Sergio Leone style.  They literally stumble across some fortunate information which leads them down the path of the civil war in the hopes off retrieving a rather large sum of money.  This also forces them to run across the path of Lee Van Cleef's character, Stenza and his quest for the same information and treasure.<br />All of this combines to make this film a \\"must see\\" for those that are fans of this genre as it leads to the ultimate climatic ending and a classic Clint Eastwood shootout.  I highly recommend this film and the entire trilogy to Eastwood and western fans.  {ssintrepid}
B00006F83Y|5.0|I must say that I have been a fan of QOTSA since Kyuss broke up. Their first disc was amazing, the second disc was amazing, and this... well, amazing. SFTD really shines when listened to in a sitting, rather than skipping around. The disc starts off with a person turning on his car, skipping around radio stations. Nick of course screams his head off in a few tracks (if you'd heard Rated R, you would have expected this), but he surprised me by actually snging in \\"Another Love Song\\" and \\"Gonna Leave You.\\" Singles \\"No One Knows\\" and \\"Go With The Flow\\" lure the listener in, while the other tracks, for example the title track and \\"God Is In The Radio\\", make you realise how great this album really is. \\"Mosquito Song\\" is a great way end the disc, letting you wind down after \\"Song For The Deaf.\\" All and all, this is the best album I have heard in what seems like forever. Support this band and buy the disc!
B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age, a band formed from the ashes of stoner rock greats Kyuss, and up until recently had been labeled as a &quot;stoner rock&quot; band, released &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;; which was the biggest surprise of 2002.  The stoner rock element is all but gone from Queens of the Stone Age's sound, and we get to hear the band in they're hard rock glory.  QOTSA's grooving music has never sounded better, and it shows on songs like the hit single &quot;No One Knows&quot;, and also on other great songs like &quot;A Song For the Dead&quot;, &quot;The Sky is Fallin'&quot;, &quot;Hangin' Tree&quot;, &quot;Song For the Deaf&quot;, and my personal favorite &quot;First It Giveth&quot;.  &quot;Songs For the Deaf&quot; is a refreshing album that along with Down's &quot;A Bustle in Your Hedgerow&quot; and Danzig's &quot;I Luciferi&quot; were the best albums of 2002 and all offered refreshing good 'ol hard rock/metal that older music fans so desperately yearned for in the era of pretenders like Linkin Park and Creed.  Even though they are becoming quite popular, Queens of the Stone Age are still an incredible band, and if you like older Black Sabbath groove oriented material then you should definitely check this band out.  All in all, &quot;Songs For the Deaf&quot; is an incredible album, and is quite a large bright spot in today's dismal hard rock era.
B000069HK2|5.0|Well, there are about 150 other reviews for this album, but I figured I'd give my two cents. <br />This album is very diverse, which can sometimes confuse the listener. Don't expect to hear 12 &quot;Taste of Ink&quot;s. The Used can do what most other bands cannot (minus Finch). That being able to go from singing to pure screaming to singing again. Althoguh it is sometimes hard to figure out what the songs are about, you can feel that the lyrics are very heartfelt. Best cuts:Bulimic, Poetic Tradegy, A Box Full Of Sharp Objects, On My Own, and Peices Mended.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Star Trek Nemesis is one of the greatest TREK films ever.  It's by the fans & for the fans.  It's got awesome AWESOME space fight action and YES some very touching scenes with Data.  I have a feeling that in years to come this will go down with Trek movies II, IV & First Contact as one of THE BEST.  Make it so.
B00007ELEL|1.0|I am surprized to see all these high reviews. My wife and I saw the movie and rated it as among one of the worst we have seen. The Dude character is cute for about the first 10 minutes but after that the movie becomes really repetitive... that and no real storyline. Very disappointed. Expected something much better from the brothers
B00005JKDR|5.0|Not my usual fare but good. Great family film. Great Disney Pixar movie. Score: 99/100
B00008AY3L|2.0|three good songs - 1st one and the last 2...now, i love ben harper's previous albums - i even really liked burn to shine - but this is a poor, miserable, commercialized, soulless and boring effort.  what [stinks] the most is that ben has session guitarists playing on this album.  i always liked him for his own guitar style, and it's sad that he (or maybe his producer) doesn't have faith in the uniqueness and originality of his guitar work.  can anyone imagine if jimmy hendrix had asked some schmo to play guitar for him on any of his albums? highly unrecommended.  (having said that, i'm going to see him live this weekend - hope he plays lot's of old stuff...)
B00000K0YC|4.0|I love the music on this disc. Sonny Rollins is a pleasure to listen to. Why only 4 stars, then? Because there is less than 40 minutes of music on this album.<br />Considering that this is a mid-price disc, Prestige could have been more forthcoming and added a few bonus tracks, as was done with other vinyl jazz recordings that were later converted into CDs.<br />The music is just too good for me to be sorry for having purchased this disc, but I do feel cheated on the quantity side. The quality, however, is superb.
B000001Y42|4.0|I think this is a very good, funny, and hard album. This is what I think of it.<br />1. - It depends on if you are jewish or not. If you are not, you might find it boring. But if you are, you might find it cool. Fred Durst also won an award for this just so you know. 8/10<BR>2. - It is a very hard and nihilistic song. I grew on this song very fast. If you are a fan of metal, you will love this song. 10/10<BR>3. - For a single this song is pretty long, but it is good. 9/10<BR>4. - Humourous at times. They went a little over the top with the...humor though. 9/10<BR>5. - Uhh, I did not understand the lyrics but the guitar sound is good. 9/10<BR>6. - Great guitar sound. 10/10<BR>7. - Uhh... ?/10<BR>8. - DJ Lethal did pretty good on this song. 9/10<BR>9. - Good song, but they should of used their own lyrics.<BR>10. - Not so good. 5/10<BR>11. - This song is ok. 7/10<BR>12. - Good lyrics Fred! 10/10<BR>13. - Too long, and scary. 5/10
B00005NWM3|1.0|If this is what's considered metal nowadays,ugh. No speck of talent here. You'd think that some 30-40 year old guy could play the guitar better than some punk rocker, but it's not the case here. Not even a trace of talent. Please go listen to something else.
