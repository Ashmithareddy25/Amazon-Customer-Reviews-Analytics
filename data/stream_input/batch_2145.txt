B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is equally well written and compiled as Proof of Heaven.  The compilation also was as compelling for me.  We learn much of the life and beliefs of Anita and how her life changed because of her NDE.  The format of questions at the end of the books helped to better explain how her life changed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am not a TV watcher, normally. But I love the English period dramas. Watched an episode on Amazon<br />Prime free by accident and got interested. Wonderful casting and acting. I am always amazed at how bluntly courteous Britians speak and react the next moment as though sharp words spoken so in your face, barely grazed them.  Americans behave most differently when insulted or corrected or confronted so blatantly. Their period clothes are stellar, stunning in design and colors!!!  I am reading the book now and it explains the culture and era and  makes the series even better.  Love the Dowager Grantham and Mrs Crowley!!!  All the characters have such individual personalities, it is great!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The writer had credibility due to his previous scepticism and training as a neurosurgeon.  It is written and compiled in a manner that made this a page-turner for me.  I'm now on my 2nd read, to remind myself of the order and details of events.
1563894696|5.0|This has always been one of the best Batman stories, and I needed a new edition. This copy came like brand new, not a bend or crease anywhere, and it arrived very quickly. And the price was very low for a copy in such fine condition. I highly recommend this book if you've not read it, it's a fantastic detective tale featuring the best Harvey Dent origin in the comics and wonderful artwork that reflects the noir and Gothic tones of the story. A must-read for any fan of Batman, comics, or just great literature. I'd definitely buy from this seller again, too.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|This movie is original, funny, and very well done. Timeless in areas. These guys were not only ahead of thier time, but pure genius with non-sensical entertainment. Nothing today can even come close.
1401229921|5.0|I must admit that while I appreciated &#34;Hush&#34; when it was first published, I always felt it was a bit overrated and that the villain wasn't too special. The art was good, of course, and it was fun seeing all the usual suspects trotted out for Batman to face down, but it just failed to grip me at the time of its release. This newest edition, however, is remarkable, using only Jim Lee's original pencil artwork in black and white, it is one of the most gorgeous comics I've seen and made me fall in love with the story. Over time, I've come to appreciate &#34;Hush&#34; much more as a detective tale and a new stage in Batman & Catwoman's relationship. If you want to own this story, THIS Deluxe Edition is the only way to go, I promise you. Hardbound and visually stunning, with a nice whodunnit that does justice to a classic villain deserving the limelight while introducing a new baddie as well. I got the book pretty quickly, and it came in a nice thick packaging. The price was really low, too, especially for a hardcover of this quality. And it looks brand new. I'd certainly buy from the seller again.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Have to work at figuring out the puzzle. Sitll working on this game but am enjoying it. I really like it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|If you love Nicholas Sparks books you're going to love this. I was not disappointed at all. I would recommend.
B004D38HOG|5.0|To people who like dramatic stories with happy ending. Book shows how modelling industry destroys lives of many young girls.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Never read a Gillian Flynn book and I will certainly be doing so now. Twists and turns and a what the.... ending. Keep an open mind and read it!
0786891416|4.0|It's impossible to read the book and not picture all the characters from Castle, but that's not a bad thing.  In fact, I don't think I would have enjoyed the book as much without the sly wink and a nod towards the TV show.  I was able to guess the baddie, probably because I recognized the formula used on the show, but there were enough twists and turns that it was enjoyable getting to the reveal at the end.<br /><br />The writing is just what you'd expect from a &#34;Richard Castle&#34; novel, and it was amusing to see what inner dialogue was provided for the titular character from &#34;Castle's&#34; perspective.  I'm betting New Yorkers love all the local flavor, but there were so many NY references that I had no inside knowledge of, it ended up taking me out of the story sometimes.  Still, it was a fun way to fill an afternoon.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This app is better than a piece of paper.  All I needed was something to take notes with and this app fits the bill perfectly.
B003EYVXUU|4.0|Loved the pacing and the casting.  That little boy gave a chilling performance for someone so young and Chloe Moretz is already one of my favorite actresses.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great book! It has you hanging on until the end! Great story with a nice twist so you never know until the very end
B00B7XGFO4|2.0|For a digitally remastered film I found it to be still quite grainy with only average color. As for the movie itself, I really prefer the Orson Welles or William Hurt characterization. I did not feel the chemistry between the male and female leads in this version as I did in other versions.
B005HF0B34|4.0|This show is very well done. The first season was especially good.<br /><br />I would compare this show to a show like Rome with less violence.<br /><br />It's not great, but is VERY GOOD.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|If you want something out of the ordinary with a great sense of humor and story, this is the one.
B001KEHAI0|4.0|This is just a great movie all around. Can't wait to go through the extras to gain a little more insight into the whole making and concept of the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just fun to watch. I burned through the first half of the season in a day. Four more words required?
B00A2LOAKI|3.0|Loved pt. 1 I thought this was just OK at this point. I will have to watch it again but I wasn't disappointed, just wasn't pleased either.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it is really fun. You can earn a lot of coins. And it has a ton of games

B007REV4YI|5.0|As someone who has followed the 50 years of James Bond (007) movies, and saw his first film (Dr.No) at the theater with his girlfriend long ago - we have all watched the progression, and cycling of actors portraying the James Bond agent character, and storyline plots.  With the inclusion of actor Daniel Craig in his third film as James Bond, his portrayal takes the role to a new high.  James Bond is NOT infallible, he's getting older, British Intelligence (M.I.6) is under deep scrutiny by the British Government as to their continued effectiveness, existence and costs, while &#34;M&#34; (mom) has those (the bad guys) who want to ensure great harm comes to her.  This movie is absolutely packed with action, suspense, terrific special effects (that are not CGI), and a storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Best Bond movie ever made - and that says a lot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm soooooooo unloved with this game. I play it like almost like everyday. Lucy is the prettiest character liv her hair!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Great cd!  Huge Rhianna fan and this cd has a mixture of slow and fast music which makes the cd even better.
B005LAIHGI|4.0|\\"The Dictator\\" is a wacky romantic comedy that brings together the world's two unlikeliest couples:  a deranged Middle East dictator who's seeking to build nuclear weapons and a politically active vegan feminist who mistakes the dictator for a dissident.  Anyone looking for a sensible and logical plot (or at the very least a coherent script) will be sorely disappointed -- it's an improv tour-de-force, with Sasha Baron Cohen falling into character, and milking the character for all its worth.  There are some hilarious moments in the movie, and if taken as yet another silly pointless outing for Baron Cohen then it also becomes a truly enjoyable movie as well.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|If you love Star Wars, you'll love this package!  Great value!  This was the best blu-ray package I found for the original triology.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Pat (Bradley Cooper) has just left a state mental institution, eight months after having caught his wife having an affair with a colleague, and almost beating the colleague to death.  He moves back in with his parents, a devoted and long-suffering mother and a father who's a violent football fan.  Pat's determined to win back his wife, and to do so enlists Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young depressed woman who's just lost her husband in a car accident.  In return, Tiffany asks Pat to be her dance partner.<br /><br />While Pat and Tiffany definitely have issues, it's this movie that's truly schizophrenic.<br /><br />First, I have questions about the casting.  Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence come across as too stupid and boring to actually have mental issues (the idea that Cooper is an undiagnosed bi-polar is just laughable).  Either a Ben Stiller type or an Owen Wilson type (vulnerable but lovable) would have made much more sense.  And there's an endless list of Hollywood leading ladies who could easily come across as mentally deranged, but Jennifer Lawrence just isn't one of them.  There's just too much force, willpower, and assertiveness to believe that Jennifer Lawrence's character Tiffany is vulnerable and depressed.<br /><br />Second, the plot is incoherent, manipulative, and opportunistic.  Because this is a romantic comedy, we already know how the movie's going to end, and the movie doesn't need to add so many redundant subplots.  A lot of the turns and twists don't really make much sense either.<br /><br />Third, there's just too much screaming and shouting in the film.  People with mental issues don't necessarily just scream and shout at each other in public all the time -- often, the expression of mental exhaustion and stress is soft and quiet, and thus the more twisted and violent.  As it stands, Pat and Tiffany seem less like troubled individuals, and more like hormonal teenagers.<br /><br />But despite these flaws the movie does work, and itworks in large part because of these flaws.  The flaws create so much uneasy tension that a resolution -- any stupid resolution, really -- is a relief.  As a form of shallow entertainment, \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" does work -- but anything more and it simply falls apart.

B003UYUP58|5.0|Although difficult to follow further into the book, especially regarding the subject of genetics, I thought this book was an incredible insight into the disease and science's struggle against it. Having lost a wife to breast cancer, I found this book to be greatly insightful in my attempts to understand this horrible affliction on humankind. An invaluable yet sobering treatise on a seemingly indestructible enemy. Wonderfully written.
0671646788|5.0|This book sat on my piano for literally years. One holiday season<br />I read it (15 years ago) and since that new year I have had nothing but success in my professional life, I kid you not.<br />I have shared the book with many of my work mates and friends and all without exception have benefitted from the read.
1451695195|5.0|Have recommended this book to many for the presentation of a picture of a possible afterlife. The author's standing as a professional and scientist lends more credence to his story and, while not proving anything, still raises the level of hope among those who are hopeful yet skeptical about such things.
B0086449YA|5.0|The wonderful thing about Mark Knopfler is that he evolves and his music remains interesting<br />and melodic. I was happy be able to acquire it so easily.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Although typical of Moore's usual one-sided view of a political subject, I found this to be informative and humorous as he, once again, makes viewers aware of an alternative to our current system.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|From the first page to the last, did not want to stop reading  the characters, there chosen roles in life intrigued me.  The story line kept pulling me, deeper and deeper  I wanted to reach the end just to know how it all played out , but truth be told I did not want the story to end.  An excellent fast paced read

B002JVWRAO|5.0|My wife got me hooked on Supernatural and I wish there were more seasons to watch. We both love the way the series is written.
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|While I enjoyed the premise of batman, who after being retired for so long, makes a return to once again clean gotham, my problem with his movie as compared to the first stems in not enjoying the ending so very much. It..conflicts with batman's story, i.e batman beyond, and alters the way the character would think and act. On a different note though, I did somewhat enjoy the final confrontation with the joker, though did not approve of the voice actor they chose for him (spoiled by Mark Hamill I suppose), and I found myself a little disappointed at the plot hole involving him going on television as rehabilitated, but them letting him don the makeup, which seemed..foolish. The last gripe, though minor, I might have was the art itself, which I thought sub par, even expecting such having read the comic it was based off. All in all, worth watching though.
B003L77GGK|5.0|My wife got me hooked on Supernatural and I wish there were more seasons to watch. We both love the way the series is written.

B004YM6JI2|5.0|My wife got me hooked on Supernatural and I wish there were more seasons to watch. We both love the way the series is written.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I liked it because it had all the detailed, plotting, suspense mingled with the high tension of unexressed but obvious sexual attraction and true respect found in compatriots with a serious task at hand. The family background put things in perspective to a hero in the tradition of the Lone Ranger of yesteryear with a colegial sidekick who is equally dangerous, skilled and athletic but happens to be a woman. The only thing missing is the silver bullet.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is probably the best game ever!!! I can't get past 650 coins. It does take some time to get used to if you're just trying it. Even a 2 year old could play it like literally I've seen one play it before. I love how it changes  the themes it was new York an  now it's Rio. The only thing I would change is how much the items cost. The people are like 20,000 coins to 200,000. But I would defiantly recommend this app!!! :)

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great Super Heroes Movie!<br /><br />I might have reduced the confrontation scene in the hover carrier after Cap discovered the weapons just a tad, but overall I thought it was VERY WELL DONE!!
B009VB97EY|2.0|The acting was bad.  I think the actors that played in this movie forgot how to act.  Also the story line wasn't all that great.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Skyfall was one of the best Bond films ever and certainly the best of the modern Bond franchise. We get to see not only how Bond came to be Bond, but a good look into what the imperturbable M faces behind the scenes. The links between the two have only been hinted at before - here we see the true depths of them. SPOILER ALERT!! I must confess, while I have no doubt Ralph Feinnes will be an excellent M in his time, I will miss Judy Dench in the role.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Excellent book.  Everyone that I have told to read it loved it as much as I did.  Twists and turns right up to the end.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Not your everyday run-of-the-mill story.  Imaginative, entertaining, and very well-written.  I recommend to anyone looking for some light weight fiction.
B00499NHLC|5.0|It was a great show. I Watched it 2 times and still amazing. Feel like he is Sherlock Holme. Can't wait to see season three.
B008BIN9EW|3.0|I really want to like this game.  I had some fun playing it for a while.  It is fun, if you don't expect too much.  Maps are small, but then they have to be on a small device.  The main problem I have is that I hit a level where it seems that, no matter what I do, I am crushed immediately.  So I got maybe 3 or 4 hours of play out of it, and then ran into a wall.  There is probably a way around it (there must be), but I don't think it will be worth the effort to figure out how to do it.  If the game were more fun, and if it felt challenging instead of like I was banging my head against a brick wall, I would work on it.  Instead I found another game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft has things you can build with like the real world such as : dirt ,sand ,gravel ,wood ( which you can make into wooden planks),and stone. You can use a crafting table or a furnace to craft stuff.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I haven't done a whole lot with this, but I spent some time playing around with it, and it works great on my first-gen Fire.  Of course, the remote PC's resolution is much higher, but I can easily zoom in, and better than that, I can even temporarily change the resolution of the remote monitor.  If the remote computer has more than one monitor, I can choose which one to view.  Response is very good, from what I've seen, no terrible lag.  Overall, this is a great little tool.  It even works passably well on my Droid X phone.  It means that, no matter where I am, I can hook up to my mom's computer when she has a problem, and see what's going on.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|In the beginning it seems confusing and hard to comprehend what is the point of some things. But as you continue reading and experience things with Charlie, everything becomes clearer and deep. Absolutely loved the way it had me thinking about life at the end.

B00AY7Q01C|5.0|A friend sent me the CD from this movie and after hearing a bit of Rodriguez's life story from her, I immediately ordered this fascinating documentary of his life.  His music captivated a nation, yet he lived in obscurity until doggedly determined researches found him.  His melodious voice, poetic lyrics and haunting melodies are unforgettable, as is he.
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|Unapologetic in my opinion is not as great as Music Of The Sun, A Girl Like Me, Good Girl Gone Bad, Loud or her best album Rated R.  How ever I do believe it's better then Talk That Talk. I did list this is her 5th best album.  How ever that is not because this isn't a great album it was because those albums was just better.  Rihanna hasn't put out a bad album.<br /><br />Best song on the album in my opinion is Jump followed by Stay.<br />Negative pour it up worst song on the album.  too many songs  after 10 the other 4 songs just seem to run together.  This is my opinion there good songs it just feels as you're listen to the same song 4 times again.  Pour It Up is a horrible song worst Rihanna song ever.<br /><br />Fresh Off The Runway * * * *<br />Diamonds * * * *<br />Numb * * * * *<br />Pour It Up * *<br />Loveeeeeee Song * * *<br />Jump * * * * *<br />Right Now * * * *<br />What Now * * * *<br />Stay * * * * *<br />Nobody's Business * * *<br />Love Without * * * *<br />Get It Over With * * * *<br />No Love Allowed * * * *<br />Lost In Paradise * * * *<br /><br />Good buy you won't be disappointed
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Good writers with good actors. This season really takes you through the despair of war to the heights of love and integrity.
B0095GL2GG|5.0|i love SG1 but Atlantis is the very best, can watch this series over and over and over i wish they would have continued the series
B006LSZECO|5.0|I saw an interview by this author and thought this book sounded good.  Since I retired I am always on the look out for good books.  Finally, after seeing it on the best seller list for weeks and weeks I decided I must be missing out on something really good and bought the book.  It is one of the best books I read this past year.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|can watch this show over and over wish they would make another movie or start Atlantis series again or Atlantis movie
B004TI5N38|5.0|I read a lot and even more since I retired.  So I am always looking for new good things to read. I love to find a new series by a writer that I love nd this fit the bill. It was the best book I had read in months and had all the good excitement and thrills I was looking for. I have already moved on to the second book in the series, The Following. Also good. Review to follow.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|was a fun game at first then it got to hard for the the kids but I would still recommend it
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Don't waste your money on this series.  It is not Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. It seemed like a total rip off to me ith similar characters and story lines.  The writing may have been a bit better but most people don't read this type of book for the writing.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This ending of this book was so depressing that it made me wish I had not read it. Sadness in huge doses and had the ring of modern day Truth regarding our Children and ourselves. The Mother engendered not much sympathy at first as wanted to shake her. Found it hard to take that she would take such drastic measures.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like most Nicholas Sparks books but this one was pretty different from his past books.  Besides the usual love story ther was some action and thrills to go along as well as a bit of a surprise that got my attention. If you like Sparks books you will enjoy this one
B000VLE3IS|5.0|ALL THE BEST SONGS IN ONE SET, PLUS DVD. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE DIE HARD FAN, OR SOMEONE WHO JUST ENJOYS CLASSIC ROCK.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Great movie, good part for TLJ. Anything set in La interests me as a native but this movie has lots of twists and turns.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|GREAT START TO A GREAT SHOW. SETS THE PREMISE FOR THE SHOW, AND GETS YOU TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE CHARACTERS.
0060763280|3.0|There are some valuable lessons in this book to take away. This one is definitely worth adding to your library.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Great for when you just need to chill. Adds pop up after every level, but you get what you pay for.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This has to be the most inspiring true story that I've ever read.  Thank God that we have  men such a  these defending our freedom!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Awful book...poorly written...sad...degrading....could not possibly see what all the hype was about...really tried to Get into it and have an open mind.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|This was GREAT!  A must see movie that will tug at your heart and lift your hopes in the positive side of mankind.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was a cute read, a friend recommended it and it was cute and funny.  I would recommend as a quick read.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Awesome movie and I understood completely that sometimes you have to fight for your right to believe in God no matter how many try to prevent it.
B008D30K7E|4.0|This is the craziest book I have ever read and it's a long time since I had a good laugh reading a book.  Very hard to review because it goes backwards and forwards at such a rate it is  confusing and unbelievable, how the author came up with it I don't know, it's no wonder he took so long to write it.  Would certainly recommend it.
B0086DBE62|3.0|Cute movie, some moments a little boring but all in all a nice entertainment for kids and adults.  Julia was fantastic as usual.
B002RI97IY|5.0|It explains so many things that were always half understood. It teaches you how to see life and it's problems from a different perspective and inspires you to enjoy it in a better way, from where you are at this moment
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|All in all a good movie, however, got a little boring from time to time.  Didn't need to show the junkies doing their thing.  I already got it that she was one.
B002XHNMVM|5.0|I liked this book because apart from being interesting it is also funny and very entertaining. It leaves you thinking, hopefully if many people read it all of us together will be able to make a change in how kids are educated, and will give them the freedom to continue being creative all their life.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|The BEST one yet!  Very very cute and the music was adorable and very modern.  I loved it so much I actually had watched it twice.  It brought out the child in me.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book gets to the root of all our thoughts, behaviours and emotions, and teaches you how to look at them from like an outside point of view. It also explains things that help us understand how and why we sabotage ourselves. It is like a profound psychological analysis from a spiritual point of view.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I went and saw this movie in the theaters, I loved it. It is close to the Family Guy movie everyone that is a fan would love to see.  Amazon's shipping was excellent with the pre-order, getting the movie on the release date without having to go to the store.... GREAT!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Unlike most programs from here, this one can b downloaded for two different devices. I use it on my tablet and phone to stay connected with Twitter
B00ADQ7JCS|5.0|This band is GENESIS, YES and IT BITES clone without copying any of them. This is a must for all prog lovers. I just love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008L1DNGI|1.0|didn't work right on my phone so I uninstalled it. not much more I can say about it, just didn't work
B009DA74ES|5.0|season 5 is pretty good, but has lost the new story bite found in season 1,2,3. Kinda like the Simpsons, & Family Guy. Its getting too old and un exciting or shocking to the relation of real life events. But still has some small twists. Not a boring soap show yet, but on its way there.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I enjoyed it, I liked all the characters in it. Could of had a little more excitement in it. Kind of slow moving. Overall I Liked it and am glad I got involved in it.
1615470158|5.0|Rob's job, before this book and related blog, was as a project manager in Microsoft's Excel development team. His 9-5 consisted of going into the trenches and asking real financial analysts, accountants & business analysts alike what they needed from Excel.<br /><br />The guy that is personally responsible for a lot of the user-friendliness you've come to expect from Excel now wants to teach you PowerPivot!!<br /><br />HIGHLY recommend for the Excel Pro that enjoys learning at your own pace with plenty of tutorials and real-world applications.
B00A6D5GBE|2.0|I found this game extremely boring. It might be okay for a child to play. I deleted it very soon after downloading it. There was no challenge to the levels and I need challenge in my games.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|She is a great writer. I have read all her books in the Scarbetta series.  Can't wait for the next one
B009MCRHH6|5.0|love love love love it get it best game in the world a must get loooooooove it you will not regret it.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|The game is a good diversion and holds your attention. It is possible to turn the timer off and just relax while playing. If you are looking for a challenging game you will not like this one.  There are a few minor problems. If the game closes during mid-play, there is no way to come back to that same game which most apps are able to do. There is a resume button but that only appears if the game is closed by pausing and going back through the menu.. There is a menu screen with an option menu that I found once but have not been able to find again that allows you to turn off music, sounds, and the timer. Hopefully, these flaws will be fixed with an update. It was a fine FAOTD.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A nice twist at the end. Justice is justice and the mother proves to be the stronger or weaker(?) parent? A mother always knows what their child is capable of.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|Stephen dropped the ball here. If you are a King fan, you could skip this one and never miss anything.
1423136802|5.0|It's a very good series at a very good price. The box is not so big which makes it easier to store. I love it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am an avid fan of Stephen King. In my opinion this is the best of his recent works! Take one of American history's tragic events, add in the option of time travel and changing the world for the better, who wouldn't try. Put this on one of your bucket lists of must read!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third book on this series really surprised me! But in a really good way! At first I was really shocked by the way things turned out, but after reflecting a little on it, i realized the end just makes sense. Maybe a lot of people got disappointed since the romance took a back sit in this book, but I think it was necessary to the way the author wanted to portray the devastating consequences of the Hunger Games and of war in general.
B00757J98K|4.0|I am fan of Madonna, this new album does not bad but neither of Madonna. Only a 3 or 4 good songs
B000FC1K66|5.0|You will love this book for its surprise ending.  Very well written and great personalities are developed..<br />Not for the faint of heart.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|From the beginning to the ending-- Albom grabs ones imagination gently,  stirs the soul from the inside out, then leaves the reader a changed person.  Very pleasing style with themes and individual characters vivid in the minds eye. Thank you Mr. Mitch Albom.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Intuitive game play. Challenging levels, very creative puzzles to solve. Works well on my razr  phone. Hours of enjoyable game play.
B004I9G486|5.0|This cord is compatible with my 2013 Volkswagen CC and my 5th generation iPod Nano. It charges when on, so you don't have to do it manually.
B00821OX98|5.0|I really enjoy this show, it's interesting and entertaining and fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes scify stuff.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Well written and held my attention once I got into story. It was recommended by Amazon because I have read other simular books purchased from Kindle library in past. This is the first Harry Bosch novel I have read. I will definitely be reading more of his books in the future.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use Evernote as my primary note-taking method in college, and to be honest, it's been one of the most helpful applications I've ever used!  My only two minor gripes are that there is a persistant bug that prevents me from editing many of my notes on an iPhone (the screen jumps around with every keypress), and the overly-minimalistic formatting options, necessitating a separate word processor for essays or any other serious papers.  Fix those, and I'll pay for the app with no regrets!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely amazing series! I didn't think downton abbey would be a show i would like because it might not be relevant but i was very wrong. This show tugs at every emotion!
B001QLHRW6|4.0|Listening to Leona Lewis mellows me into total relaxation.  Her voice is so wonderful that she would be able to sell her version of a phone book!  A long soak in bubble bath, candles, and this music can transform you!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best series on TV!! Our whole family just loves it including my 16 yr old Son!!
B00846REIS|4.0|Everyone was good-looking'' no ugly ducklings ''' too much in common with fifty shades..good story line' anxious for book 2
B007TK77QE|1.0|boring, all it is is people bitching behind one onother. It took 50% of the book before a story started to emerge. I will never purchase another book by her.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Hard to put the book down!  I love how Preston and Child write.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|What can you say, this series of Batman movies are the best! Well acted, great story line and it leaves you still wanting more.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it wont come back on after Im tired of playing then just Cu's I like it I uninstall an reinstall it twice ive done this and every time I reach 20000 it cuts off. so it does it again I wont do it agaian but if it wouldn't. do that id give it a five
B0000669JL|5.0|Bob Marley is a legend in the reggae style music world. I love listening to this CD in the summertime. This was the first CD to start my reggae music collection. This CD shipped on time and in good condition.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This movie is the greatest film of all times showing life aboard an old sailing warship.  It is accurate down to the flying wood splinters, one of which spears the captain in the neck during an early battle.  Russell Crowe is wonderful as are the other actors.  I have watched it many times and I never get tired of seeing it again and again.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This is a pretty hilarious movie. My brother told me about it awhile ago and I hesitated buying it right away. I finally got around to checking out the trailer on YouTube. I figured I would throw in & check it out. I like fresh spoof comedy & Tucker & Dale deliver gunney sacks full of red neck humor while dealing with college kids who really need to go back to middle school. This DVD shipped on time & in good condition.
B003GDYN24|5.0|I rated this 5 because I loved the dance beats.  All of the songs were hits to me and though I have other music by Kelis, this one is my favorite to date.
B008EKOO46|3.0|This was no where as well written ,sweeping in interpretation of the message  especially when you compare it to Guns Steel etc.It was  repetitive and really told the same story with different twist over and over--
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Not too far from a typical harlequin romance. Well written a nice distraction. Recommend for travel or vacation lite reading.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|As usual very well written,clear in the presentation of a complex situation between the rivals and a brilliant education of the historical events and times with the intrigue and depth of a great novel
B001DJ7PNW|4.0|I would definitly recommend this movie for anyone who wants a good introduction<br />to the whole JFK assassination conspiracy theory and facts surrounding his death.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a very enjoyable book. I could not put it down once I started reading.  A good mix of romance and suspense.
1936608618|5.0|This book is great, there are so many exercises and things to learn. It shows how to do movements and most importantly how doing movements incorrectly can affect your performance.
B004GTKP3S|4.0|...Except for Judi Dench and a few others. This was a very good series that ended too soon. The final episode was kind of a feel-good wrap-up episode, unlike the ongoing series which was both funny and sad.  Still, this was a most enjoyable watch, and I would actually give in about 4.5 stars if we could split our ratings that way.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Grand kids love playing this game .  I have tried, not that easy.  Improves eye / hand coordination  if you have someone with that issue.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I enjoyed the read, the characters, the mystery and the twist! Going back and forth in time was good but had to get used to it... Looking forward to another Kate Morton book now.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This is the pre-quel to all the Alien movies, it's a great film great special effects.  I would recommend this one
B002VPE1WK|4.0|For a couple of cameras and lenses, plus accessories this is a great bag that is half the price of bags I saw at Wolf Camera. You can even carry your iPad and connection kit! Good construction!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does it again. A highly readable attorney yarn that combines the author's legal expertise with his knack for a suspensful story. I recommend it highly as a travelling companion.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|Great CD! Love her! One of the best CD's I own, great to work out to and love listening to when I'm working around the house.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this is the worst app. took to long to figure out how to do anything. big waste of time, uninstalled.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Not wanting to be a spoiler, I can't state specific plot points but there's just too much implausible about this movie to make it a truly great film. There were too many lingering questions for the move to work.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I bought this book because of the new musical. And This story is so epic and sad. I believe it is a must read!
0765367297|4.0|Having played the game before reading this book, I cannot offer first hand experience of how this book will read to someone who haven't played the game.  However, if you played the game and remotely enjoyed its setting, then this book is highly recommended unless you have medical condition that forbids some light reading.<br /><br />This book lays down the gist of the war, who is winning by how much, and most importantly, how the main protagonists of the series came to be.<br /><br />The book excels in in-lore universe explanation and character ability building.  Info dumps are carefully sneaked into military/scientific reports that doesn't read out of place (I would imagine that such reports should actually be critical part of storytelling about military personals), and instead of just laying them out, we have characters interject their opinions on the report to give them more weight and context.  And through detailed training camps and exciting battlefield exploits, the characters' abilities are revealed to the readers in entertaining fashion.<br /><br />The book sadly falls short in character building.  While the story talks in great detail about how John-117 becomes this super soldier, it simply reveals how he has all the necessary traits to be a respectable leader and soldier.  The closest we get to character building is when John talks with Mendez, but ironically like Mendez' character flaw (bad conversationalist), these events doesn't tell us much other than hinting possible growth (yes that's double vague, hinting of a possibility).  This probably has more to do with lore restriction (John-117 is, after all, raised in rather 2-dimensional environment) than Mr. Nylund's writing, so it isn't to fault him.  Just be warned that if you are looking for some sort of character building outside of more measurable abilities (like how fast he can move, shoot, jump, etc.), you won't find much here.<br /><br />Again, I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested infinding out more about the Halo lore.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved reading the whole book...good character info...kept everyones lives interesting.  Going to see the movie soon so i can live through it again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Literally foreign and a foreign lifestyle but with amazing transitions and changes for all the family and their servants. Superb.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|great free app with lots of really fun features. you don't even have to spend money unless you really want to. you could play this game easily without ever spending a cent. I highly recommend this game for people who love games like diablo for Pc. dungeon hunter 3 is sort of like it but not as in depth. very easy and fun to play and the classes you can choose from for characters are great. graphics are very good as well. overall a very great free app that everyone should have on their device.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie does it yet again!  The song selection is her standard formula, the band is smokin and her voice is mellow and pure.  Loved it.
B00933JL0A|5.0|This is upbeat fun game to play,I love this game, I gave the game 5 stars because you can play the game for a long time.,<br />There is so many world's to play, you get to name each one you play, and you can go back to them, .
B007THA4FI|3.0|The writing is very much what I would expect from J K Rowling, but trying to follow the myriad of characters for the first 1/3 of the book was too confusing and seemed somewhat meaningless.  The story itself lacks any real substance and by that I mean it seems like a chatty, soap opera of the British sort.  It was disappointing for me.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I learned something about how to change habits. It is useful to me to discard habits I do not want, and aquire habits that  I do want
B0095P29EG|2.0|Really should be a comic book fan before watching this or skip it. Just could not stay interested in it.
B004BSWC8A|5.0|One of my favorite movies--excellent cast, all of them, good script and fantastic location shots, and most of all one of the best film scores ever, based on the beautiful folk song 'The water is wide.'  Having it on blu-ray is the crowning touch.
0062200909|4.0|The art work and pictures are well done.  The book is a good presentation of the movie.  It was a gift, however, and the receiver did love it.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|This follow up to the original 'Lincoln Lawyer' does not disappoint.  The premise of the murder mystery revolves around the real estate foreclosure crisis. Criminal defense attorney, Mickey Haller is such a fun character that I lost sight that he is trying to get a murderess off. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because I am getting weary of 'fat cat' corporate bosses being depicted as evil and greedy bad guys.
0802473156|5.0|Our marriage enrichment class used this book (along with the Four Seasons of Marriage).  We thought we should give a copy of this book to all young couples who got married at our church!
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Sniper personal accounts are a favorite genre of mine.  I am glad I read this book since Kyle was recently buried.  I feel for his surviving family and maybe this purchase will help them in some way.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|We watched the instant video first to see if it was worth buying. Once we viewed the movie, we purchased the dvd and watched it again. It was that good.
0385344333|4.0|I always enjoy a good Reacher book.  This one is much better than the last one.  I though Jack was showing some emotion and feeling in this one, which had been lacking somewhat in the last few.  I'd like to see his character become a little more realistic and human, like carrying a small bag with toothbrush & paste, shaving equipment, a bar of soap, maybe a change of underwear, a notebook, pencil - stuff almost every person in this country would need and want even while traveling \\"light\\".  I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, a lot of intrigue, good mystery and especially liked the FBI and CIA women, a good twist.  I would have given this a five star except for the last part of the book, the description of his moving through the warehouse, blue dots on doors, etc.  I had trouble following it, couldn't picture it, it was confusing and probably not necessary to have all the \\"door\\" and \\"room\\" detail.<br />Even so, I would say this is a definite recommendation to read.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This game on her kindle is on nearly every time I find her using it!  She doesn't always people to play UNO with, so this solves that dilemma perfectly.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I was unable to down load adobe flash to my kindle.  Still getting a pop up window that is very annoying.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is what my 8 year old tells me about this game.  She is enjoying this brainy game on her kindle very much.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|Had no problem with the tilt feature on my Kindle, this game is really fun to play and I love the look of the game. I'm glad I checked what the free game of the day was!  Even if it wasn't free, I think it's more than worth the 99 cents!
B00846TRHY|4.0|This was a surprisingly great movie.  Terrific story with great acting and terrific action scenes.  My wife and I watched it together, and we both loved it.  The title is a bit goofy, but don't judge a book by it's cover.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|Another Classic Banks novel.  If you enjoy the technology side of the culture then you will enjoy this.  The minds take on the lead roles in this book.  Looking forward to the next Banks novel.
B0059DQHHI|5.0|This movie is so gripping that you won't even notice you're reading subtitles.  I won't tell too much else, because I don't want to give away the plot.  I just know that my wife and I were blown away by the storyline.  Great movie!!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Don't know why I have two copies of the Dirty Dancing movie.  Must have been a mistake on my part.  However, I love the movie so I'll have an extra if one doesn't work.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was very skeptical at first when a friend had suggested this book. It did not sound like anything I would be interested in. I had a vision of this being down the alley of a romance novel, which I do not read or have interest in at all. I'm a realist and am so thankful I gave the first book a try. How wrong my first impressions were! I could not stop reading and was immediately so intrigued and turned on at the same time. Such a nice change of pace of what I usually read, but had a lot of the thriller page turning attributes I go for. Would definitely read again and most definitely recommend. I hope E L James comes out with another soon, but there could never be another Fifty Shades!
B000LE16VW|5.0|Love the movie.  Love anything Patrick Swayze played in.  Demi Moore was excellent in this movie.  I cried all the way thru.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|its nice to have an app for the kindle instead of just a link but it needs to be competative with the android app and its not
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Read the first book which I think is essential if you are going to buy this book.  The first book is great and this is even better.  Follett knowledge of history is amazing and he brilliantly writes about fictional characters with the history of the time. Love, war, sex, espionage...what could be better.  And it is an easy read.  Can't believe I am on page 850 and I am sorry it is almost over.  Read &#34;The Fall of Giants&#34; first, then get this book...you will be glad you did.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|it is pretty good but i cant back up my contacts onto my kinde from twitteror fb app like with android so thats annoying
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|Great for kids and adults. A wonderful homage to the classic films in the horror genre. Burton at his best; warmly mining the great monster movies, and his childhood dreams, to craft a loving tale of an odd genius winning the day.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Lack of pressure sensitive input severly limits your ability to make detailed drawings with accurate shading and highlights. It is a feature that I assumed would have been included on a Sketchbook product particularly a \\"pro\\" version. Not really sure what having the pen mode enabled does as I found no difference with or without it checked. *Update* I boosted my rating up to 5 stars after finally discovering how to set the min and max opacity levels necessary to provide pressure sensitivity. This program is now top notch, but definitely needs a user guide even if only through the website as nothing on the tutorials covered how to change the settings to take advantage of devices with pressure sensitive pen technology.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter loves this Temple Run 2 game. She plays it alot. I'm too fond of it. Thank you so much. Lisa
B004EF65QA|5.0|I expected (and was looking forward to) something cozier/safer like Pride and Prejudice. This is a far grittier experience, raw and provocative. There are no easy answers in this story. Complex issues are tackled deftly and with a surprisingly even hand. And these characters show real weaknesses, make truly bad decisions, make you question whether or not you can root for them.<br /><br />That said, the romance in this story is also just incredible—the very best kind of slow burn. Richard Armitage is one of the most compelling leading men you'll ever encounter.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this highly enough. I watched all four episodes back to back and then couldn't sleep. I've been thinking about it and preaching about it ever since. WATCH. IT. NOW.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is one of my daughter's favorite games to play. Not one of my favorite but it will do. Lisa
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|With the game in B/W makes foravery nice experience. I would give 5 stars yet game is 4.5 stars. if you didn't have to play this game with the highest brightness. Plays well on my GS2.<br />Great FAOTD. One of the better ones I have seen. Get it while you can.<br /><br />Oh...  No permissions!! Refreshing!!<br /><br />Game works with tilt sensor only. But works very well!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Got this game for a little girl that spends time with out family. It is her favorite. Thanks so much.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I was very surprised to see how good this game is.  It is like a 3D version of Mahjong.  Easy to play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Once I get used to it I'm sure I will absolutely love it. Just haven't used it as much as I thought I would.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|The film is a collection of footage of four different babies from four very different parts of the world.  There is no narration or dialogue, just the footage and music, which works fine.
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter loves this game. It is one of her favorite games to play each day. Thanks so very much.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie is in every way amazing. The cast is superb and does an excellent job, and the score does not disappoint either. The sweeping visuals and breath taking scenery are just a few bonuses of the film. Peter Jackson has done justice to the title, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I do not think that any of the nay sayers have read the same book - that or it has been a long time and they need to go back and read it again. The film does a great job of filling in holes for those who do not delve into the other works of Tolkien and do not go over the many, many notes. There is much to love here, and I cannot wait until Desolation of Smaug in December 2013. The movie truly feels like a homecoming for any LotR fan, and in that sense I am glad that The Hobbit was filmed afterwards.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying the 2-Dic DVD and the blu-Ray extended cut that will be released closer to the third quarter of the year.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|Johnny English strikes again!  The absurd comedy of Rowan Atkinson meets the campy absurdity of James Bond all rolled into one deliciously absurd 2 hours of nonsense.  High-brow, this is not, but if you want to laugh, get off your high-horse and have a wonderful time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a very well-written book, told through the eyes of Katniss.  I had a difficult time putting it down.  I enjoyed it more than Harry Potter, because the main characters are presented in more of a believable manner.  And the story seems less forced.<br /><br />There's some love story intertwined as well, so if you're into that kind of stuff, hopefully this book could satiate that desire.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|the book goes into a more detailed account of the times and the people living at the time before and durning the wwi  and also gives a greater incite to how the world was veiwing the bolsheviks and the inside revolution taking place in Russia. gave me a lot of view points that I had never considered before
B002BBJ52U|4.0|Love this movie when I am home alone and need a good chick flick! so funny and enjoyable and the casting is awesome.
1451695195|3.0|I found this book interesting, but I can not recommend anyone else read it if you are looking for a Christian interpretation of Heaven. I can see why it might be good if you are looking at Heaven with a scientific world view.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|You cannot put this book down.  It is gripping and the author stays way ahead of the reader in his suspensful story. While nonlawyers will also love the book it is a must read for lawyers.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|maybe it's me but it seems a little unlikely to me so far. I do not plan at this point to get the other books.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I was excited to buy this Les Miserables album but was disappointed to hear that the songs were acted out rather than sung.  It is a much better experience to watch the movie than to listen to the songs by themselves.  A big disappointment with the decision to leave out &#34;A Little Fall of Rain&#34; as it is one of my favorite Broadway songs of all time.  Another downside is the focus on the more famous actors rather than the bigger singers, as I am not too pleased with Amanda Seyfried as an actress, let alone as a singer (Mamma Mia, anyone?).
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Some of rock's best classics on these disks.  Can anyone get the phrase; &#34;money for nothing, chicks for free&#34; out of their heads once heard?<br />Mark Knopfler is a certified genius and some of his best stuff was with Dire Straits.  This is a great collection to own.
B0015AARJI|5.0|i like, it is very good if you have one, i use her  to play with my son y my nephew
B007REV4YI|2.0|Not sure how people could possibly give this movie a 5 rating??? They must work for MGM.....<br /><br />Completely ridiculous plot. They can't protect M from one crazy guy with all the assets and military that the UK has so Bond must take her to a remote location to kill everyone himself. P L E A S E.........<br /><br />Not nearly as good as Casino Royale.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it! Can't put it down.  Like temple run, the second one has the beasts, but only much bigger and there's only one.  Before you get this, I'd do the first one first. I'd do that because it will get you used to the game.  You can earn coins and get buy new characters! I'd recommend this to everyone!
B00992CF6W|3.0|electric stuff, a way to chat with (like type it in) sortable like a chat bar. also a way to change what u look like. THANKS
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it fun to play.  I'm a girl. I have friends. I like u. your fun to play with. I don't have any thing else to say I'm just saying twenty words so I can three free diamonds fir this game.  Ps I think u should get this app
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game all the time. Whether waiting in the waiting room at the doctors office or just relaxing at home. Great game.
B008Q09K2U|3.0|Its ok but the main person is too wise cracking for a really read . But its not too bad  nothing like as good as the writer.s early stuff
B004DTXJ4S|4.0|Great Movie. We downloaded it onto our kindle and watched it on our long plain ride. We liked this one and the one before.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Best historical biography I have ever read. Even better than Truman which was great as well. Truly shows what a genuis politician Lincoln was.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|There are so many great songs on this album. I got it for workouts but I enjoy listening to the songs on this album all the time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Lovely period piece filled with angst, laughter during WWI and beyond. The scenery is gorgeous and the wardrobes are lovely.
B00AB0AXU6|4.0|We liked this movie. We down loaded this onto our Kindle so that we could watch it during our long flight.
030758836X|1.0|I couldn't get into it.  I tried.  I know many people loved it.  Some loved most of it, not the ending.  I ended up giving my copy away, when I couldn't get past 100 pages.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this card game. It is fund to play anywhere and a different twist to the solitaire card game.
0802130208|5.0|As the author of Howie Weener Unclogged: A Colonic Noir Musical Memoir, I am thrilled to have my book compared to A Confederacy of Dunces, which is one of my all-time favorites.  Great writing and funny, a rare thing in a novel.
B002HSSAY6|5.0|If you like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, you'll love this.  Both have the same director, Sergio Leone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic series for adults who are not looking for Suvivor or Snookie or the such.  Look forward to each episode.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This thing works soooo Well in my car. Just press the green button once and Siri starts talking to me through it. My iPhone 5 connected easily to this device and I have not had any trouble sending verbal text messages or any other voice commands. People tell me that they can hear me loud and clear (even if I'm on the freeway in my noisy car). Great Product.
B007REV4YI|3.0|That's what this outing reminds me of--those brutal Vin Diesel flicks from a decade ago. Or maybe the Rambo franchise of the '80s. A lot of KERBLAM and KABOOM and over-wrought plot. The contrast between hushed dialog and seismic gunfire and explosions that have you using your remote more than Bond uses his trusty PPK, for fear of your neighbor beating on the wall if your TV doesn't have \\"smart sound\\" automatic level control. My old Magnavox 27\\" set that croaked two years ago had it--my new Toshiba 46\\" LED flatscreen doesn't. Which has me micromanaging my audio and running down the batteries in my remote on flicks like this. And here I thought technology made ADVANCES.<br /><br />The teaser scene before the opening titles was so lengthy (almost 15 minutes) that it had me wondering if there was was an error in my copy that dropped me into the secene AFTER the opening titles. Somebody here mentioned Christopher Walken--this film's villain Silva is up his alley. Rather than world-historical power issues like Hugo Drax or Goldfinger, Silva is an ex-agent who has a grudge against M for her leaving him dangling in the breeze on his previous mission. Never mind that expendability is the name of the game in his job--a reality that Bond has always faced in the same profession, over 22 earlier movies. Silva comes across as more of a poor-me whack job than the megalomaniac that Bond villains have usually been. I say \\"usually\\" because we've seen this before in the \\"contemporary\\" Bond era, as witness the fellow agent turned villain Alec Trevelyan in \\"Goldeneye\\", who blamed Bond for letting him be shot and captured by SPECTRE. There is a certain aw-come-on factor in the way this film's \\"alternative Monneypenny\\" starts out as a field agent who botches a mission and ends up M's receptionist a la her traditional counterpart as we've seen since \\"Doctor No\\". And unfortunately that's not the only aw-come-on in this film, or even the biggest--anti-spoiler constraints forbid me from telling you any more than that.<br /><br />As we've seen in earlier Bond films, there's a graphic leading into the closing credits saying Bond will be back, but I'm hoping that the next one will be done with a bit less \\"that was then, this is now\\" and a bit more \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\". Progress that isn't really progress, well...ng you any more than that.<br /><br />As we've seen in earlier Bond films, there's a graphic leading into the closing credits saying Bond will be back, but I'm hoping that the next one will be done with a bit less \\"that was then, this is now\\" and a bit more \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\".

B0095P31L6|4.0|This was a very good animation. The plot of the movie is basic: Good guy becomes hero and saves the town and gets a girlfriend too! Looks great in HD on my 55&#34; LEDTV
B0089EHWQE|4.0|A very moving story with characters I could relate to.  Not formulaic but as complicated as real life.  The plot moves along and keeps one reading.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|I just sometimes like movies that are just fun and light hearted and make you smile and sometime laugh or cry and this movie does that.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|although very raw language, it fit the script and helped form the<br />character.  Washington is great in the part!  Eye opening about alcoholism.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|love playing this game , i have a niece that lives out of state and we play it all the time, thats a favorite way we stay in touch..
0977326403|4.0|In this Collins brings a handful of actual success stories to make his point. Each one of them was very beneficial when considering traits of a good leader.
B009HELT3C|3.0|For some funny Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones this is a good watch for vegging out entertainment with some quirky comics and a good laugh or two.
1250027624|5.0|I purchased the first book that came out  and knew that I had to get this one also.  This book is more of a character study in that, it has chapters for each of the main characters and talks about them and their relationship to the others.  It's a quick read and I'm glad that it has been added to my library collection.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My husband and I are hooked on this program. Great writing and character development along with suspense, intrigue and vulnerability.
B0043WDK2G|4.0|The characters develop through the series even a s the episodes standalone. The tension between the two leads is palpable... I don't see how they can keep this up for 5 seasons.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best YA books I have ever read.  Actually a good book all around. It addresses mental illness, Teennage bullying and discrimination of gays. It is written as letters to symathetic friend who seemed like they would understand. The reciepent is never named. When reading you actually forget you're reading letters which is quite a feat. A wonderful book for young adults.
0375869026|5.0|This book does not take to long to read because it flows smoothly yet memorably.  I bought and read this book based on the recommendation of Nicholas Sparks.  If there is one book that you want to read to lift up your spirits then this is the book.  Kids can even read this book and parents do not have to worry about any excessive violence.<br /><br />The characters especially August will give you perception and perspective on looking at things and issues with patience, not everything or everyone is what they seem.  If you are to error on judging the character of someone, then error on the side of being more nice than mean.  I love books like these that are simple yet effective on their stories and characters.<br /><br />I have a special needs brother who has grown up with the same predicament as August- he has Down's Syndrome. He has grown like any boy with the ups and downs of life and with the loving support of his family.  That makes the difference.  He is in his mid-forties and he is a Wonder to all of us.<br /><br />If you want an enchanting and uplifting story, then this is the book to read.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book,\\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This isn't the type of book I like, it was recommended to me by a friend, who clearly has different taste than I do.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. The topic the story addresses is unusual  and the telling of the story wonderful.
1400032717|2.0|I am fascinated by autism. People with autism think differently than most people, and I am very intrigued about the precise differences in thought patterns. This book, unfortunately, just didn't grab me. There was something about it that seemed too methodical, trying to get inside the head of an autistic boy but not authentically grasping his feelings and world view.<br /><br />I much preferred the non-fiction accounts I have read from people with autism. Those interested should check out Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant by Daniel Tammett and Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's by John Elder Robison.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Terrific characters, witty dialogue, spellbinding plot. A great read for fantasy readers.  Looking forward to reading more in the series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely amazing reading. I'm very disappointed the books will be over soon. Everyone should read this collection of books .
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I got it for a Friend who thinks it is awesome, and listens to it probably each day, maybe more than once.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|A friend saw Joe in concert and bought this dvd and loaned it to us. We enjoyed it so much, we bought our own copy. As usual Joe put on a great show with added guests that made it even better.
B009LT1YZ6|1.0|On Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, the fish doesn't often appear. The games starts and there is no fish, but the black orbs and white food are displayed. Sometimes pausing and restarting makes the fish appear. Sometimes choosing another level works. Just a pain to play. The game itself is a simple time-waster. Not in a negative way, just like many other games to pass the time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thoroughly entertained by this book. If you are a Grisham fan, this is a must read. If you aren't, you will become a fan after reading this one/
B0038P59A0|4.0|My husband liked the movie more than I did - he'd probably give it 5 stars.  Sometimes I just get tired of the &#34;action&#34; scenes....but it was a good movie!
B00417HV14|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this. Seeing Eric Clapton, one of the greatest ever, on stage with Joe Bonamassa was the highlight of the show. Not to slight Joe..it's obvious he's the best younger guitarist on the scene.
B0086DBE62|3.0|So glad I did not pay to go to the theater for this one.  Would not watch it again but won't say that I didn't like it so gave it 3 stars.
B004LROUNG|5.0|As i was finishing The Racketeer, there was a list of other Grisham novels and i had missed the Litigators somehow. Being an older book, and price was right and the book was thoroughly entertaining. I think i got more than my money's worth on this book. I was sorry to see it end!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the best have ever played. I really do recommend this to all of you. please get it
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|Outstanding cinematography, beautiful sets and an attempt at telling an engaging story characterize this movie. An English country estate for retired musicians is on a continuing mission to remain self-sustaining.  It houses a group of remarkably talented people who seem well cared for, but have few visitors. It's a pretty isolated country place, almost no interaction with the outside world until their annual fundraising event. This situation deserved to be explored further, but instead the script takes a shortcut and focuses on an old love rekindled. Speeding through relational issues (which in reality can be tricky) made the last half of the movie end on a sweet note. I hope this comment does not discourage either the exceptional actors nor Mr. Hoffman from trying again. It's important to remember that senior moviegoers are seasoned readers who expect a strong storyline and  multi-dimensional characters. Special treat: The classical music is lovely.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I love Ian Rankin and Rebus  seems like a good friend. This new novel was not a disappointment. For those who do not know this author, it is a police novel. If you are looking for entertainment and  relaxation in the same book. this would be it!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is an entertaining/hold your attention story. Watney is an engineering superman. Syfy channel should make it a movie. The editing needs some refinement. Some words missing letters or missing altogether. Had to plug in some here and to make sense of what I was reading. Could have used a few less f-bombs.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed this film, it had more depth and heart than we expected. Go Helen Hunt for having that body!
B007P6VM04|4.0|BUT WITHOUT THE DANCING SCENES AND THE FINE ACTING, IT LOOSES SOMETHING.  STILL LOVE THE SERIES AND WILL KEEP WATCHING.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good Valentine's day read. Loved it. Love all of Nicholas Sparks books. Now I can finally go see the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|BETTER THAN EVER!  Hard to believe, but the excellence goes on and on.  From Robert to Daisy, I love each character, except for Thomas.  We have a love-hate relationship.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I found this app to be easy to use and entertaining.  The graphics are real-like and just fun to play.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is very easy to play.  It is much easier than shuffling cards!!  And I love any game that I can beat my husband. ;)
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|I am an ardent fan of Downton Abbey and have watched all the episodes from Seasons 1-3. Season 3 in my opinion is not as great as the previous two seasons, primarily because I felt a lot of the subplots got resolved in a pat manner and some characters, significant ones at that, are killed off. I won't mention which ones so as not to spoil the experience for those who are yet to watch the series but some of the actors playing these roles wished to move on to other projects and so there was no choice but to get rid of their characters.<br /><br />I thought Season 2 was a sad season because of the war and the losses resulting from it, including the death of a well-liked character and some dramatic turn of events. However, after watching Season 3, I have to say that the current season wins hands down in being a downer. Bates (Brendan Coyle), who is valet to the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) and is married to head housemaid, Anna Bates (Joanne Froggatt) gets sent to prison for the murder of his first wife though he claims he is innocent. For much of this season, Anna spends what little free time she has chasing leads to clear Bates' name and set him free.<br /><br />Downton is also in serious financial trouble thanks to the Earl making some questionable investment choices. All this and there's a wedding to prepare for, the much anticipated wedding between heir Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) and Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery). Will Downton survive? Lady Sybil is pregnant with her first child with husband, ex-chauffeur Branson (Allan Leech) and comes to stay at Downton for the wedding, though later events may cause the couple to remain indefinitely at Downton. Lady Edith who is always unfortunate in matters of love, thinks she may have finally found happiness, but as is often the case with Edith, things don't always go according to plan.<br /><br />I admit that this season does have a lot of depressing events in it but despite it all, it remains a riveting and engaging watch. I love how Julian Fellowes balances the drama of both upstairs in the Earl's family as well as the politics of downstairs. Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan)suffers a medical scare, Mrs. Patmore finds romance, and footman turned valet Thomas Barrow (Rob James-Collier) displays his sensitive side. There are some interesting developments among the staff but one can always rely on butler Mr. Carson (Jim Carter) to remain steadfast and stodgy!<br /><br />Dame Maggie Smith who plays the formidable Dowager Countess Grantham is amazing as usual and has some of the best lines in the show. She delivers them with such panache and is definitely one of the stars of the show. I think she is indispensable to the show's continued success and is certainly one of the main reasons why I adore the series so much.<br /><br />The sets, costumes, and cinematography remain as exquisite as ever, and though I could have done with a little less soap opera and bad news this season, I still would not trade Downton Abbey with anything else on TV at the moment.atch.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting, great story line , keeps your attention without violence or over the top sex scenes.Very well done for a change..
B005KDWUFA|5.0|I love Il Divo and this cd is superb and with songs that are not on their other cds.  What's not to love!!
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|I was ready to put down the book at page 60 but persevered and was well-rewarded. I love &#34;historical&#34; novels set in NYC before it became a gated community for the uber-wealthy and this book delivered. The writer did a good job of weaving together lots of characters meting out acceptable levels of justice without jumping the shark.
B000IY03DM|5.0|I think this was their first cd but it was the first time that I've heard it and it was great.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Loved it wished they hadn't quit the series. Hope to enjoy more of the series. I am enjoying the prime TV
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Grisham at his best. I thought I had it figured out several times and there I was again back to square one.
B00499NHLC|5.0|We were pleasantly surprised by this Sherlock. We have really enjoyed it and are looking forward to seeing the rest of the series.
B00133KFGW|3.0|Bought this as a gift. It's a interesting movie. Lots of cool music, good story line. A bit sad a times, but over all good.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|great game ... worth $3 ... :) This game kept me thinking and was a great hidden objects game. no compaints at all.
0545265355|5.0|Couldn't put this series down. Had to have and devour the next of each book. Liked it so much I read through the series back to back without stopping.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|i think it is one of the best series i have ever seen i am waiting for season 2 as i have to of them preordered
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was a happy accident of a read. I randomly chose the books and found myself captivated by the mysteries and potent characters. I am now on to Shift, the prequel to Wool.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Only watched a few episodes so far, but I think it's pretty good. If you liked the 'style' of the Robert Downey Jr movies, you'll like this show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best game apps out there.  I always come back to it.  It's fast paced and challenging..requires some good reflexes and coordination.  But that can be developed as you get used to the game.  The amazing part of this app is it costs you nothing.  If you haven't downloaded it yet.  Try it and get ready to be chased by security!  Happy coin collecting!
B0017SWPXY|2.0|I found this book to be very very slow. I also found the many many references to racing cars almost cumbersome. I appreciate the plot however I found myself often breezing through the lengthy racing analogies and discussions to get back to the actual story. I guess it would be perfect for someone who loves race cars and dogs.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down (read in a single sitting)!! I never would have guessed what the twist was all about. A must read.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I needed something intriguing and fun to read and this clever story did not disappoint.  I have added Kate Morton to my list of favorite story tellers.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|A little Dark.  Not the same kind of levity the earlier Bond movies contained. No special gadgets which in my opinion made 007 exciting.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|After having to reset my Kindle to get this app. I was not able to read it off line.  Do not recommend anyone wasting time trying to get for a kindle
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Good action film.  Surprise ending offered suspense.  Acting was average...no real character development.  Entertaining for a couple of hours. OK.
B004TN7QPG|4.0|I installed this reader and had a little trouble getting it to sync with Dropbox. Eventually I figured out that I hadn't configured the settings properly. If there had been instructions that were more easily understood, this would have helped greatly. Now, after having sorted that out a few days ago, it has been better. It's still not a flawless sync, so I can't give it  5 stars. I do like that I can highlight and make notes on my epub documents.<br /><br />Update: 9/4/2013<br />There have been several updates to this app. It sync's much easier to sync with Dropbox now and they have even added Google Drive syncing. I am upping my review on this app.<br /><br />It works much better and smoother. Overall, I don't have any complaints! This is the only app I use for annotating and highlighting documents.
B00338QELU|4.0|This is the first book written by Mankell that I have read,  and I have become an instant fan.  The  translation allowed the tale to flow beautifully. A great read, hard to set down.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Silver Linings Playbook has a very interesting plot and is well-written; however, I prefer the movie.  There is a certain level of humor to the story that is just more entertaining to watch in the movie than to read in the book.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Flight opens with full frontal nudity of a woman which offended me immensely. The movie was another addiction story and was very predictable.  I was disappointed as I usually like Denzel Washington movies.
B003G94BZC|5.0|I love the Dr Who series from many Drs. ago. Amy And Rory are the best<br />compainions next to Rose.
B00881VLCE|5.0|good good good good goood game i love it am addicted to it besides minecraft this game is so fun its unque from any other puzzle games i've played
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Love the director. Not really appropriate for the younger set but if you are  a fan then it is characteristic of his style.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Scary & funny at times too. Loved the storyline, although it does get a bit silly towards the end. LOVED Jessica Lange!!!
B00BESM14U|4.0|A bit dark, great quotes! Very unique characters and a fresh take on teen angst. I looooved Emma Watson and the two main guys

B000UJ48O0|5.0|My wife is obsessed with the show and followed it while it aired on television.  When I saw the had a box set I had to buy it for her.  I have watched through all of them many times and I have even grown to enjoy them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Plenty of extra features when the episodes run out and you need a little more.<br />- Great quality materials inside with awesome presentation<br />- We got it on sale so you really couldn't beat the overall value.<br /><br />Go ahead, if you plan to indulge or gift you won't be disappointed.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I had my doubts about this movie as I thought it would be a bit too negitive, but I was pleasantly surprised and liked it a lot.  I am always amazed at how good animated movies have become. See it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter and I really enjoy playing this game together. Being able to play with the horse feed and take care of the stalls are a great touch as well. I would recommend this game to anyone with kids.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This film is one of the best in the James Bond series.  It is well acted, directed, and produced.  Some of the stunts are unbelievable.  Watch the credits at the end to see all of the stunt people that made this film possible.  I like Daniel Craig as Bond.  I think he is much closer to the actual character portrayed in the book:  cold, calculating, and tough.  It was good to see Albert Finney again too.

B002JC9RMY|4.0|While not the greatest movie of all time, this is still a good movie for the price. Also if your a Dragonball fan, then it goes with out saying that you'll likely enjoy this movie. James Marsters as Piccolo is a must see!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is very well done in every way I can think of.  Young girls and women will especially like its positive message but I can't imagine anyone (of any age) not liking it.  I think it must be hard to make a movie that both kids and adults will like, but this movie pulls it off.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|It was good but more then half the book or 75% of the book was a lot of detail about Yemen. The action didn't really happen until the end. Regretfully not as good as his first books.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|I would definitely recommend seeing this movie to anyone.  I think this might be Tim Burton's best work to date.  I especially liked how the plot harkened back to scenes in the the original &#34;Frankenstein&#34; and &#34;Bride of Frankenstein&#34;.  Very well done!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|This game is ok.  I would like to see more stats without going to leaderboard.  When you finish a game it moves too fast before you can tell how  you did
B009RI4FRU|3.0|This movie came highly recommended, but I really didn't like it that much.  It's okay but I really didn't see what all the fuss was about.
B00AG51V8E|2.0|[Spoiler Alert] Sometimes people just want to watch an action flick with semi-decent acting, convincing sequences...A doable suspension of disbelief. That's all that this movie is...if you can catch it on HBO or something, do that. What's clear is that you can't judge a movie just by it's billed cast. This is where the movie studio casts a big name and kills him in the first 15 minutes, the way they did Willis here. Think about what's happened to those that have started collecting paychecks this way in the past - Steven Segal. I think it's pretty despicable, actually. I don't appreciate that kind of deception at all. Bruce Willis just lost some points on his stock .

B005LAIII0|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is another stunning example of Lee's artistry, one that defies any formulaic account of how the magic of life in all its delicate detail is brought to screen. Lee's sensibility is primed to make the best of the literary adaptation of the Booker Prize winning novel by Yan Martel. The trials following \\"Pi\\" Patel the youngest member of the Patel Family, zookeepers who have resolved to move from their native Pondicherry, in India, to Canada, is brought to screen with subtlety at so many levels that one cannot help but marvel at Lee's sense for storytelling, his eye for talent, and for his ability to bring to life the many emotional registers of this story of a resilient father lost to a son, and a son who in turn manages to bring that father's life lessons to bear on his quest to accomplish what is truly grand in life. Pi's rage to find a response to the final questions he has on God, the meaning of life, and the vast array of philosophies that merges and emerges growing up in the heart of the great tropics - India - is the grandest example of a cinematic \\"trip\\" we have had all year.<br /><br />The scenes with \\"Pi\\" telling his story in flashback, of his quest for religious unity in a world where Gods and Dieties abound and haunt his imagination, his conversations with books late into the night, along with altercations and loving interludes with his close and inseparable family is contrasted with the uncompromising self-reliant individualism that Pi is subjected to in that fateful journey across the seas. The long migration to Canada initially seems like a fool's quest but the deeper emotional notes in Pi's odyssey across the seas has an empowering tragic sense of life that has no equal this year at the movies.<br /><br />Ang Lee stretches his own range of interests in his quest for a deeper emotional connection with religious themes in Martel's novels. Pi's lone quest in a raft, struggling to come to terms with his demons, in the open sea, also opens up a range of interpretations. Depending on your interpretive mood and fancy, Pi's altercations with a Tiger, Orangutan, and Zebra, could be taken as real or figurative/hallucinatory encounters.<br /><br />The sheer beauty and detail of the digital imagery that unfolds on screen, the breathtaking vision of young Pi lost in the ocean is, in and of itself, only spectacle. But these visuals, become a beautiful, even consoling, vision of a human being absorbed in his infinite struggles and longings. The brilliant decorative pieces on the cinematic canvas become vast signifiers of life's deepest meanings. And none of this gets ponderous, or pretentious. This is a tale told simply, furiously, of Pi's resolve, of his sadness, love, loss, and protests. Pi's scream in a crucial hallucinatory moment, when he is numbed by thirst, hunger, and exhaustion, and face to face with his father, his mother, his brother, lying deep in the ocean, in a cry of protest, is the best single scene at the movies this year. His protest transcends the infinite stretches of the skies and the ocean above and below him.  Lee's attention to Pi's anguish, this moral epicenter of this grand visual spectacle, is a moment on screen that reminded me, again, of the aesthetic power of cinema. Great directors do this constantly and Ang Lee manages to bring these moments to the screen this year more than any other film I have seen. A young man striving to remain true to his calling, as a son, an orphan, and finally a representative human being striving beyond his native strength, is a great moment of cinema, where tragedy and triumph meet without separation.<br /><br />Lee shows how he has developed mastery over stories that have incredible reserves of human emotion when it is handled with deftness. Lee knows when to let the narrative drift in the high seas of this drama and he also knows when to build and unleash those transcendent moments in his careful staging of the characters and scenes, in some truly unforgettable flights of cinematic artistry. This is an old fashioned story, in turns allegorical and deeply human, that relies on Lee's control, his unerring sense of timing and quiet artistry, his impeccable awareness of how to control the tension in the drama during its ebbs and flows.<br /><br />This story of Pi Patel and his family is perhaps Ang Lee's best film since \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and his underestimated Hulk (2003) and is also my pick for the best movie of the year.<br /><br />Lee is at the peak of his powers, doing what he does best, in his third decade as a major director, with his delicate perceptive powers coming into its own in its fullest expression. \\"Life of Pi\\" is literary material with a moral theme that can turn stiff, dull, and pretentious in less able directorial hands. But Ang Lee manages to keep his explorations of the triumph and tragedy of life on screen well within the bounds of taste to make Pi's unraveling tragic story a redeeming one. What is on display here is the simple miracle of family life, its redeeming power, despite the tensions and tragedies that abound on the surface.table flights of cinematic artistry.

0143121006|5.0|I had never heard of this case before I did a random search for books on cold cases and this popped up. I thought it sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The book came quickly and was in great condition. I started reading right away and could hardly put it down. The author has written this strange tale in a very engaging way and I was drawn into the story immediately. I particularly enjoyed the details in the place settings, which really helped me paint a mental picture of 1930's Peking and the types of people who moved in the city's social and political circles. At the end of it all, I found the author's conclusion of what probably happened very convincing and thought-provoking.<br /><br />I would urge anyone interested in true crime, cold cases or Chinese subjects to check out this book. A solid buy.

They felt too hurried and not as smart or thought out. Still had to finish the series though since it kept me interested enough in what happens to the characters.

B00APUYN0I|5.0|I am not in to acapella but I do have to say the music in this movie is really good. Anna Kendrick's cups is really good considering she was just using a cup as an instrument. Music aside what made the movie for me is comedy. The cast is great and would recommend you see this movie for sure. Its actually real  world funny and not cheesy like those bring it on cheer leading movies.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|With the growing proliferation of technology for TWITS it has become next to impossible to find a dictionary.  Hard to believe,<br />but true.  I will go to my grave believing that knowing how to write a &#34;whole&#34; word and know the meaning of that word is vital<br />to human communication.  President Obama gave us a good example of how little importance dictionaries have become in our lives when, while struggling to criticize something a Republican congressman said,  he stuttered trying to think of the title of this dictionary and finally settled for &#34;Marian's Dictionary.&#34;
0452270073|5.0|...and no one came?<br /><br />This book is the first in Pat Barker's trilogy on World War I. It was nominated for, but did not win the Booker Prize. The other two books are [[ASIN:0452272726 The Eye in the Door]] and [[ASIN:B001IDZK0I The Ghost Road]]. For the latter work, she rightly was finally awarded the Booker. Barker's novel appears to be meticulously based on known historical facts, and conveys the horror of that particularly awful war more truthfully that mounds of history books. The central aspect of the plot concerns the preeminent war poet, Siegfried Sassoon, of which an excellent collection of his poems appears in [[ASIN:B000VAZZXG Selected Poems]]. Sassoon was a \\"true believer\\" who readily signed up for the \\"good fight\\" in 1914, but by 1917 had become severely disillusioned, and simply decided to stop fighting. As one might image, the British power elite realized that this was a \\"political hot potato,\\" since Sassoon was not only \\"one of them\\" but had achieved considerable fame through his poetry.  Thus, instead of court-martialing him, they opted for the \\"temporary insanity\\" gambit, and he was committed to the Craiglockhart War Hospital, near Edinburgh. It is a classic dilemma and theme: in an insane world, are the inmates of an insane asylum the only sane ones?<br /><br />Dr. William Rivers is an astute and morally sensitive psychiatrist, who sympathizes with Sassoon's position, yet has the unenviable task of trying to convince Sassoon that he should go back to the war that none of them now believe in - and he succeeds! Barker weaves numerous sub-plots into the primary Sassoon-Rivers relationship. For example, it was Robert Graves, noted author of [[ASIN:B001PLG38Q Good-Bye to All That]] and [[ASIN:078612220X I, Claudius]] who helped \\"fix\\" the Boards in Sassoon's favor. Fellow WW I soldier Wilfred Owens is an aspiring poet, and a member at the asylum (Owens would also go back, and would not survive the war; Sassoon not only survived, but lived to a ripe old age.) There are also interactions with noted pacifists, such a Bertrand Russell.<br /><br />Though the entire novel is set in England, Barker deftly brings out the horror of war via the flashbacks of some of Rivers' dysfunctional patients, many of whom have \\"shut down\\" as a method of protesting against the madness they could no longer stand. One of the more fully developed characters is Prior. He chooses to become mute... and Barker explains why this is much more common among the non-officers than the officers. There is Anderson, a physician, who broke, in part, because he was doing 10 amputations a day. And Willard, who will no longer walk, due to a non-existent spinal injury. Particularly horrifying was Barker's descriptions of River's experiences with the brutal methods of a fellow psychiatrist, Yealland, and how they apparently worked, in \\"curing\\" the patient. Barker documents her source, and it is worth a follow-up.<br /><br />Barker's work is replete with incisive observations on the madness of war, and the stresses and changes it causes in normal human interactions.  Consider: \\"I don't think it's possible to call yourself a Christian and just leave out the awkward bits.\\"  \\"Old men were often ambivalent about young men in uniform, and rightly so, when you considered how very ambivalent the young men felt about them.\\" \\"Yes, it's true apparently, he did die instantly. His father said he had, but they don't always tell parents the truth. I've written too many letters like that myself.\\"<br /><br />Sassoon's homosexual inclinations, along with Graves', are alluded to on more than one occasion. There are numerous other topical themes, including back room abortions. And there are the women of the home front, yellow, but making good money, working in the munitions plant. Barker also depicts some memorable romance scenes between one of the munitions workers, Sarah, and Prior, when he manages time-off from the hospital. She uses some beautiful metaphors, and I'llnever be able to see a \\"rock pool at low tide\\" without thinking of this book, though Barker refers to a sense capable of reveling in the pungent rather than the visual.<br /><br />It's been almost a hundred years since Sassoon wrote his \\"Finished with the War - A Soldier's Declaration\\" which was read by an MP in Parliament. It all bears repeating, and Barker commences her novel with it. The last paragraph is:<br /><br />\\"On behalf of those who are suffering now I make this protest against the deception which is being practiced on them; also I believe that I may help to destroy the callous complacence with which the majority of those at home regard the continuance of agonies which they do not share, and which they have not sufficient imagination to realize.\\"<br /><br />A trilogy that will be read in its entirety . 5-stars, plus for this volume.never be able to see a \\"rock pool at low tide\\" without thinking of this book, though Barker refers to a sense capable of reveling in the pungent rather than the visual.<br /><br />It's been almost a hundred years since Sassoon wrote his \\"Finished with the War - A Soldier's Declaration\\" which was read by an MP in Parliament.

B00BESLHEA|2.0|Considering the mentioning of \\"Quentin Tarantino,\\" you would think that this movie is at the same level as Kill Bill, but it is not.  It is violent and a bit silly.  There is some laugh here and there but overall, it is not worth watching, certainly it is not a \\"family movie\\" to watch with the kids.  What does Quentin Tarantino \\"presents\\" mean?  He did not direct this as the director is RZA.  Unless you are really crazy for any fung fu movie, if not, you may want to look elsewhere.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works great just like it should Sometimes it will not allow me to type in a comment or status. Not sure why that is.
B00932HEX2|3.0|There are things that I liked about the pilot and the first episode. The plot kept my attention and the acting was very good. But there was too much explicit sex and violence for my taste. I understand the show is about a Marine who was held captive and tortured for 8 years. But there was no need to show the torture and inhumane treatment in such detail. It could have been done more indirectly, without so much explicit violence. I felt the same way about the numerous scenes with couples having sex. Also, in one disturbing scene there was almost full frontal nudity with a woman who was interviewing for the job of a Middle Eastern prince's mistress. It dehumanized the character even more and also the actress. I won't be watching any more episodes.

B000AU9UYM|4.0|I purchased this in 2013, long after its release date. Inside the DVD box were Batman themed promotional items that did not seem to come from Warner Brothers. The movie and bonus disk are authentic. I wasn't sure about the promotional items. It doesn't really matter, since the expiration dates are have long passed. I am happy.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This was one of the best shows of season 3.  I was on my edge of my seat to see what was going to happen.  Love this show.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This one of the best true stories to come out of WW III... It shows a real portrayal of the men in the air on both sides without the usual German prejudice!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The ranking on the best-seller list and the glowing testimony of an older gentleman who had read this were my reasons for reading Gone Girl.  To my dismay I found the writing just average.  The storyline kept me interested, but the ending felt like a let down. The twisted and evil and manipulative  thinking of the characters I found creepy and not my cup of tea, thank you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is challenging and fun..Would recommend it for kids as well as adults that like these types of games. Of course you can spend real $$$$ but can enjoy with out investment also.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Definitely a fun game. I find it relaxing at the end of the day. I ike the music ~ I find it very soothing.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series blends real life human drama with the historical importance of that era with… My wife and are addicted…
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The horse animations are actually very impressive for a tablet game. The horses movements are very fluid for the most part and watching the animations is delightful. The game could, however, use some improvemtents. It would be nice to hear some different sounds now and then. Birds chirping while you watch your horse trot about, perhaps transition between night and day, better sounds for hoofbeats when you train/compete. The tack and other items for your rider and horses are also very expensive. It takes a lot to save up for a simple black bridle and matching reins. Also, this game employs a secondary currency called Gems. These are like Smurfberries in Smurf Village. To get them you have to spend actual money and there are a lot of items in this game you can only get using Gems. You can get free Gems by leveling up (1 Gem per level), or by going to the offers (Get Free Gems!) section. There are lots of offers, but I haven't found any that don't require information like your phone number or email address. This review is getting me 3 free Gems. Overall, I really like this game and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a way to pass time.

B0012GTZC0|5.0|I like WW II stories and spies stories so this was a perfect book for me. There were quite a few twists and turns but not enough to be confusing. The plot was exciting but not too complex. My wife and I both loved it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Now that I have finished the third season and am still one week ahead of the televised series, I am having withdrawals, eager to see the next season and wondering how long I shall have to wait.  I have a comment to make about the ending but will reserve that to avoid giving it away to those who haven't seen the show yet.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The book is probably not as intriguing as &#34;The Fall of Giants,&#34; but it is definitely good historical fiction.  There are lots of insights in this volume, and it does not dwell as much on the actual &#34;war&#34; of WWII as it does on the effects of the war on people and families - women are especially well-covered in this book.  I think that by the time Follett finishes this trilogy, we will have a good picture of the twentieth century.  A picture that does not include a lot of the glamor and triumph that is usual in historical fiction.  Instead, we see the effects of war, down and dirty, on many people who are both combatants and non-combatants.  The mistakes and stupidity of the century are also well-illustrated.
0307720950|3.0|While the book is interesting, it has some substantial flaws and omissions in information.  A lot of the aspects of the book, I am not an expert in or have only a passing knowledge of. So I have to believe the author has done their due diligence and is portraying more than just their opinion,but factually based information. Then there are areas where I am an expert and there are glaring errors and omissions. This concerns me - I am now suspect of the information I have read where I don't know any better.  A lot of what is being described in this book is LEAN MANUFACTURING methodology. Striving for the Holy Grail of one piece flow.  There are some nuances that will change how some manufacturing is done, but nothing earth shattering or even new.  Yet at least.  The point of no return for me was the clearly Silicon Valley tech geek biased comparison of the NUMMI plant vs the TESLA plant.  Yes, I know we have to start someplace, but trying to compare the manufacturing factory - built with a large influx of tax payers cash -  of a specialized vehicle that employs 1,000 people and is building a whopping 5,000 cars it's first year and hopes to build a whole 20,0000 cars annually at an average $70,000 retail price to an admittedly \\"antiquated\\" factory - yes, built with tax incentives over the years - that employed 6,000 people and turned out 250,000 cars a year at a $15,000 retail price and not giving the real facts is doing a dis-service to those reading the book. There is now a group of people with a very skewed and unrealistic view of the \\"magic\\" of the Tesla plant. (and a lot of the hype reminds me a lot of the Solyndra situation) While all that new technology is cool and flashy, the Tesla could be much more affordable, reach a larger group of the population, have a larger impact on the environment, market, and perception of the auto industry had they not opted for the mega tech plant for a start up and then folded that new technology in as their profits and volumes justified it. As it is, with the price of a Tesla ... can they survive long enough to get to real mass production, an affordable price tag for the average person,  and be accessible to more of the population?<br /><br />An interesting read, but I would caution readers to take the information here with a grain of salt - it is more of a story of what the author hopes the world can be,not necessarily what it is or can be.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Its a great game for all ages. You should get it if you like dragons and fun. Fun for all ages. Anyone should get it .  Great game on any device.
0321356683|5.0|A clear an concise collection of essential practices for programming in java. I've been programming java for over a decade and nearly every item gave me something to think about.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wow, what a roller coaster of emotions. Great writing, great characters..Was biting my fingernails off on how this was going to end. Just when you think nothing more could happen to this couple....
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|His other bond movies were very good. This one was slow and plodding. Also, he looked emaciated and ill throughout the movie. Hopefully he will return to form in the next one.
B009XWD02G|1.0|dont know i didnt order it so give it a try you might like it didnt order so i dont no
B009XY97VC|5.0|Talk about great inspiration music! Music to get lost in or to work while listening to, this album stacks up with all the other TSFH albums. Excellent sound. Please have a subwoofer while listening.<br /><br />I also found that I really did enjoy the tracks with English vocals, something not very common with TSFH.
B005HSL626|1.0|it was ok didnt like it but that me so try it you might like the game it took up to storage space
0345525558|5.0|This is a unique book, with real life emotional struggle depicted in the life of a young survivor of the foster care system.  It is realistic and moving, pulling you in to the character's struggles...  with compassion rather than criticism, you will learn to admire the main character.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season one gets you hooked without a doubt - season two even better! Would advise to anyone wanting to follow a wonderful story!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's faster and better than being on my PC. I use it all the time. I dislike not being able to stop ads from creeping into my news feed. They don't do that on my PC but do so on the app. Not sure if it's just me not knowing how to stop them though. All in all, a perfect app.
B003NX76BM|4.0|I really liked it a lot. Cute dogs and good plot. Very interesting and creative. A must read for sure.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have enjoyed reading a three of the books. It's been fun trying to figure out his secret. And watch him turn into a decent man
0425263916|5.0|This book was intense because of the story line. Loved it and can not wait to read the 3rd edition.
0385738765|4.0|The story is very intriguing, but I felt like it was full of plot holes.  The conclusion (The Death Cure) was a huge let down.  If I had known, I might not have bothered with the series.  Still it was an entertaining read.
0425263908|5.0|I enjoyed this story so much. The story line is better thank Fifty Shade and I can not waity until the 3rd edition is out.
0385738781|3.0|I enjoyed the first two books in the series.  The Maze Runner was very original, but as the story went on into the Scorch Trials, the plot holes seemed to get bigger and bigger.  The final book in the series was a let-down.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|Rick does a great job at writing books and keeping them very interesting, all the way to the very end. It's not as good as the Percy Jackson series but it is still really cool to read.
0440419514|5.0|Years have passed since I first read these books, and they are still at the top of my list of fantasy trilogies.  Pullman is brilliant.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|Not my cup of tea I'll admit, but it definitely got my attention and it was extremely well made. The I think the studio should think about making a second game of this.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The Angry Birds can drive you nuts and find it fun to be nutty.  Thanks.  You have given me and &#34;the world&#34; some fun time.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|The app is nice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it. There are some out there that are just as good for the same quality but for free.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 2 is great. If you're watching it, you obviously already know it's great. If you have friends (male and female), most of them think it's great. It's so great that the muppets AND Jimmy Fallon AND random people on YouTube have done parodies of it. So watch it.
B009LT1YZ6|2.0|I can't say that I fully understand the controllers, therfore It could be my ignorance. But if they gave a tutorial, I may rate it better.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Skyfall is one of the very few recent Bond films that can compete with all of the great Bond films of the past.  The plot was great, there was just the right amount of action, and they did a great job building up the villain.<br /><br />Without giving away any spoilers, I also want to mention that they throw in some nice references to the older Bond films throughout the movie! If your a Bond nut see if you can catch them all!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|No one, that's who. This game is better than the first with new features, and better graphics than brave minus the price. I would recommend this over the brave app. It's worth it!
B003VW8GT6|4.0|One of his most noted Westerns.  I loved this version on Amazon because you get the full movie, no cut or deleted scenes like you see on TV.  Though Rio Bravo came first, I personally like Robert Mitchum and James Caan in El Dorado over Deano and Ricky Nelson in this movie.  But they're essentially the same movie.
B008B92U32|4.0|It's the first app I downloaded from the amazon app market. Good app and worth the few bucks for a cheap laugh here and there.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The original series looks great in this remastered format.  Amazon Kindle is worth the price for this alone!  I'm working my way through the first season and plan on watching every episode of the original series.  Works great streaming over a PS3.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I really enjoyed the intertwining of plots in the first book of the trilogy.  It left me with anticipation for book two, and waiting to find answers to some questions that had come up.  I am well into book two, still awaiting answers to questions, but have some of them answered.  I am really curious as to how book three will resolve many of the deep twists.
B008M7JODC|4.0|This is a good series.  It seems well made and is definitely interesting and mysterious.  The characters seem real and the overall tone of the series is compelling.  There are some campy moments and there seems to be a disconnect between what the series will be about and what it is actually about.  For a first season this is a pretty good installment.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Dark, catchy, filmed partially at my college. How could you not love batman..even if he is played by a guy who overkills the deep voice just a touch? This is a great story line and the visuals will keep you tuned in even if you are not entirely thrilled with all the casting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just when poor Mary finds someone who truly understands her, can put up with her when she's difficult, totally love her, she loses him. I wish it this end of a character could have ended in another program or two. It was too much, too soon.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Not to be missed. Addictive British soap opera taking place in the post wwi years. Great characters, acting, plots.  Enjoy.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Loved the series, full of pathos and solidly compelling themes. I started watching dubiously, then I became hooked.<br /><br />I recommend it to families, who like suspense dramas.<br /><br />One bad thing: the show is tremendously anti feminism. There are clear examples if this, though, there are plenty of token nods to the female leads' vital roles. Nonetheless, the woman are clearly depicted as damsels in distress.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In aircraft pocket edition, you can build castles, fortresses and even hotels. My personal favourite thing to make is the castle
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I wish there was more time spent on the Aviation parts rather than the Dependency on Drugs and Alcohol...I'm a Pilot and although the CG was nice...the cockpit and instruments were not those of the crashed Aircarft...The mock-up on the ground was an Old DC-9 broken up...However the interior instrument panel was from an upgraded B717...with Glass...But I'm sure the Aviation Consultant figured he could get by wiyh a cheap DC-9 hull from the AriZona Desert Farm..and substitute and upgraded Cockpit and Simulator Mock-up for the movie...since the general public would never catch the difference technically speaking &#60;&#60;&#60;LOL&#62;&#62;&#62;
B00821OX98|5.0|My husband and I have enjoyed this series tremendously. The characters are beautifully developed. Storyline is fabulous. Thank you, Spielberg for your imagination and your talent.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I enjoyed this season, it was filled with yummy eye candy (Johnathon Rhys Meyers -soon to be Dracula & Henry Cavil - the new man of steel) Granted, the story line does take some &#34;made for TV moments&#34; but can you blame em? After all sometimes the truth wouldn't be as juicy without a little added ingredients here and there!<br /><br />Overall I think if your a fan of the Tudor stories, of King Henry VIII or even curious or looking for a period piece then give it a go, sit back and let the sex, blood and passion engulf you. In my opinion its a fun and visually satisfying treat, and the adds and mixes to the story line are forgivable.
0307352145|4.0|Written in a content-rich, but easy to read style Susan Cain makes the clear case that those who clamor for attention (extroverts) may not be the person for the job. Why multi-person in-person brainstorming sessions actually block other creative persons. Highly recommended for anyone assembly teams for non-trivial efforts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|just so awesome keeps me a very bored person preoccupied love love love my whole family got the game Gran is playing too
B007THA4FI|5.0|I love the way J.K. Rowling writes. I wasn't expecting much after all the so so reviews, and maybe that is the reason I liked it so much. Comparing it to the Harry Potter series is just a bad idea.... I liked it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am the very last person in the world to hear Adele, so I ordered this for myself. It arrived quickly and in good condition and shall be enjoyed.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This app has the potential to be great but it requires u to spend money too fast. Very discouraging at times.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play this game daily and my brother and sister love too play it too. :) They play it on my kindle fire all the time and they get mad when I tell them they cant play on it._
B001B9BEF4|5.0|EASILY IN THE TOP TEN OF THE MUSIC CREATIONS I'VE LISTENED TOO. EVERY SONG ON THE DISC FLOW TOGETHER SEAMLESSLY TO MAKE A VERY ENJOYABLE MUSIC LISTENING EXPERIENCE, NOT SORRY I PURCHASED THIS ONE AT ALL.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I have gotten several other puzzle games, but this is the best. It's actually a real puzzle, not just moving a broken picture around.
B004JM9CRM|1.0|I like the actor in this movie so we thought we would give it a shot. The entire movie was filmed with him inside of this box trying to get out. It had a few parts that were suspensful but I was not excited about the time I spent watching this low budget movie.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I don't recommend this game to children under 6 years old. You also have to pay for additional items that you may want while playing the game. My 5 year old gets very frustrated by this game and I think it needs to be changed for an older age child.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|I luked this game okay but it doesn't keep me interested. Its confusing on turning the cube to match squares. I would not purchase again.
B007Y612KA|5.0|This is a well-done movie that generates all of the excitement of those 1920s and 1930s pulp science fiction novels (aka Doc Savage, etc.)  The effects are nice and the story line moves along quickly enough to satisfy.  The acting is not always top-tier, but it works in this movie.  If you enjoy giant robots, super science, and action then you will like this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love this game!!! just wish it wasnt so hard to unlock people and stuff would also be cool if there was different worlds!!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I Love these books (The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices) Can't wait for The Dark Artifices to come out!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Jack Reacher is at his unbelievable best. Terrifically paced, full of heart-pounding action, this book will keep you up at night until you finish it
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I Love these books (The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices) Can't wait for The Dark Artifices to come out!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I couldn't wait to get back to reading the book every evening and I just hated to have it end
B008Y78M60|4.0|Redford has a way with finding nitch stories to brign to life and this is in line with that direction.  The acting was very well done and the story (although it was not hard to predict) was well presented and had a good speed to it.<br /><br />In the end I enjoyed and emotion and delemmas that were presented and the way the charactors struggled through them.  The presentation of the time period was well done also.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is lots of fun and my cats can't scatter the puzzle pieces or sleep on the puzzle whenever I get up!
B0096BIENY|5.0|Bought this to listen on my Bose CD.  FANTASTIC.  You can hear each person's voice with such clarity and enjoyment.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Lest we all forget the human tragedy that was slavery, especially the horrific way landowners treated slaves in the name of their right to do with them as they pleased. As told by an indentured Irish girl who saw the good in a person regardless of color, and a slave girl who hoped for true identification as child of a good slave owner.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I do enjoy this game. I seem to be really good at it for some reason. i win alot. That makes it fun to . I would recomend to everyone.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|We bought this and had to invest in more. However, the newer ones were cheaper and are much more bright.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am obsessed with this game I love it. I play all the time am stuck on it. I would recomend to everyone.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn...what more can I say? His novels are always well written and take the reader on an exciting trip of adventure and intrigue. Not for the faint of heart but realistic. I will not talk about the storyline because I feel the some of the intrigue is in the discovery pathway for the reader.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Writer goes off on a lot of tangents. Stick with it though, it all comes together. If you run you're going to want to read this.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book is very entertaining. It has a twist in the story that takes you in another direction from which you thought you were going. It's an easy read. I would recommend it. I will say, however, it is nice to read a novel without a lot of sex and foul language. If this is what you are looking for, don't read this.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I gave my friend Season 1 for her birthday; season 2 for Christmas. She loves the show. I might run out of gift ideas, if she cannot wait and orders the other seasons for herself.
B003Z8S3AS|5.0|This is a classic movie and a really good soundtrack. It is one of those movies you can watch over wand over and never tire of it. The music compliments the actors and action well.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Ben Affleck did an amazing job as star and espially as the director of this factual movie.  Well done!  5 stars for sure!
B00B3MN65K|4.0|I enjoyed this work from Josh Gorban.  He is very talented.  The music was good and enjoyable.  I would recommend it.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|Love the black and white. Beautiful. Nice music. Control is smooth. I would buy it. But I got it on &quot;app of the day.&quot;
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This series is very interesting. Lots of depth and many directions the show could go in. My wife and I watched it all weekend...drove my kid crazy :-)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great series..exciting, engrossing,suprising and horrorifying. The performances are great as is the story line. Can't wait to season 3 begins.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a really fun book; kind of a McGiver goes to Mars! Maybe a bit far fetched, but non the less a terrific read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I could not stop reading, but when I finished, I was sorry I had spent the time and attention.  Read if you want to be diverted.  Ultimately I found the characters not likable and the hero's ultimate decision creepy.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Excellent service and fast deliveries *****<br />Best place to do on line purchase anything you possible can imagine get it form here, no questions ask........
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I stopped watching this half through. Too many storylines exist just for drama, producing unbearably maudline scenes, whereas opportunities for real drama were constantly passed up. By the mid point of this series, the trenches were just an excuse to show Matthew walking places and barely even looked dirty, Bates had become an insufferable sap, and any character that dared to espouse a liberal idea, would be doomed to also play the role of the simpleton.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game is a great find.  No complicated control moves and beautiful graphics.  The main thing I like is that if you mess up in the middle of the level, YOU DON'T HAVE TO START THE OVER, unless you want to better your time.  The REVERT button was a great idea.
B001IUBZAU|5.0|AC/DC strikes again! What a cool album. Have it on a playlist that is played in my vehicle quite often!
B000000OPW|4.0|Bought a used CD which I have always been wary of but it arrived in very good shape and looks like new.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|it must be something (alcoholic) in the water out in California but they just can't seem to stop making movies about drunks.<br /><br />I think hat this is largely because these movies write themselves. The scenes in this movie will be all to familiar to you if you have seen any other Hollywood drunk movie, the completely oblivious drunk who is &#34;powerless&#34; in the face of his addiction, the alienated family, the girlfriend who only wants to help him, despite the fact that all he deserves is a brick to the head. I mean really nearly everything in this movie is a cliche.<br /><br />**Spoiler alert**<br /><br />The one and only novel or interesting part of this movie is that, despite being completely drunk, Denzel Washington's character actually does save the day. No-one in the whole movie even disputes this fact. After that, it is just another movie about a drunk.
B001JL2V1K|5.0|I guess if some folks can't have everything they feel they have to rate the product badly.  Most of the DVD os fantastic -- even the newcomers and the non-guitarist.  The star performances are awesome.  Even the finale is enjoyable -- what would you expect?  More I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, there are a lot of people who have detailed the content and what some don't like.  I happened to see the one hour TV cut on DirecTV and that led me to buy the full Blu-Ray DVD.  I'm glad I did even at a &#34;rare&#34; DVD price.  It's worth the money and it IS an investment.<br /><br />And those who rated this DVD based on the one hour TV cut, should be ashamed -- they just don't have a clue.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|This movie was bad, real, bad!  Even seasoned actors could NOT help the writing.  What a waste of time.  Sad waste of time.
B0033AX1YG|5.0|I like Gary Moore and his Blues for Greeny is one of my alt-time favorites.  This set covers his work and shows what he can do.  Any fan or interested guitarist will enjoy.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Essential if trying to dowload PDF files.  Easy to download and use.Another great adobe product.  Use it at home and at work.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Pros:<br />Plenty of keys, more than the Nostromo. Solid construction, good weight and grippy feet that keep it from sliding around, keys have a nice feel. Ergonomically speaking the G13 is setup well, it has a comfortable angle for the wrist position. LCD panel works well and is more useful than you might think.<br /><br />Cons:<br />If you plan to use the analog stick for movement, there's a good chance you will be disappointed here - I was. The stick is small, and the top has a sharp, raised circle that gets uncomfortable after prolonged use. Your thumb will slip off during game-play as the grip is almost non existent. The designers claim they envisioned the analog stick being used more as a quick flick weapon switcher or a toggle of some sort. Bad idea since it reduces the usability over a broader range of games.<br /><br />Other:<br />Aside from the poor analog stick design decisions, this is a quality gameboard that will serve you well in battle.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I loved this albumn in the seventys. and still like it very much. rate this albumn at A++++. Great songs.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I laughed and nearly cried. Really enjoyed the story. Well written with just enough technical description for the story but not too much.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I am pleased to report Isiah was busy with this program for quite some time. He gets bored easily so I would give your game a thumbs up.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I am a blu ray fan, and a star trek fan.  This is a good combo.  If you like these two things, you won't be disappointed.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|I have no back ground in reading music and can still make a passable effort at a song. Great fun and learning to boot.
B001OKJU4M|4.0|This movie is about a man who just wants to go home. Various things conspire to make the trip more difficult and increase his determination to just go home. I saw it when it came out in theater with some friends and enjoyed it but then it seemed to attract nothing but bad reviews from reviewers who thought that it was somehow racist or fascist or anti-gay. Not so. How many movies feature a kid helping a man to launch a rocket down and LA street?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found this an interesting book. I was surprised by some of the actions. She seemed adventurous - not sure I would have been that way at that age.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I gave it to my ten year old daughter for Christmas. It was a hit with her and I enjoyed it too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AMAZINGLY ADDICTIVE····· couldn't live without knowing that this book existed !!!!! I wish that I could meet the AMAZING author behind this AMAZING series !!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I are dreading the day when we watch the last episode. I wish there were more TV series like this. The writing is wonderful and the actors are incredible as well. Season 3 is just a great continuation of a great series.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Thought I would read this one to see what all the hype was about.  Pretty good book just not sure if I will be purchasing the others.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a fairly simple game. The challenge is trying to beat your own time again...and again...and again...and again...<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars because I can't seem to stop playing it.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|This book is a very good counter balance to the pessisim that seems so prevalent these days. The long term outlook is very good.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great tool for promoting sleep, wide variety of sounds, just what I want in a white noise program. The concentration sounds also work well.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|great movie a little bit for everyone great date night movie would watch it again. even my fiance liked it!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Have read all of the Mitch Albom books.  I can't wait until his next book comes out.  His books are very inspiring.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|One of the best films that I've seen lately. Clint Eastwood was at his finest in this one. Hope there are more to come from him.
1400052181|4.0|After reading this book, it was amazing to learn that there were virtually no privacy laws around personal medical information during Henrietta's life and times and incredible to realize that these laws have come into practice so recently.  You will be amazed at some of the practices that took place during Henrietta's lifetime and even later.  I'm so glad that the Lacks family found someone they could trust to help them understand their mother's story.  You will be surprised how this book keeps your attention.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I sat in my bed until 1:00 in the morning reading this I highly recommend this for people who like adventure
B0001WTVUW|1.0|This is about as unrealistic a film as you can get.  Perhaps this movie was designed to quiet the real fears of the nuclear-disarmament movements ... see, nuclear war isn't so bad, sweetheart.  We all climb on our horses and ride into the sunset .. minus a few houses and people, of course.  Radiation sickness is referred to, but by and large people seem to be doing okay with it.<br />Akkkk!<br />\\"Threads\\", on the other hand .. now that is a realistic movie.  It sits with you for a long long time in a very disturbing way.  The clouds in this movie are radioactive, without any silver linings.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood was cast perfectly for this movie. It kept my interest from start to finish. If you like Clint Eastwood at all you will like this movie.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|We saw this move a few years ago, and have since watched it many more times, thanks to Netflix, but finally decided to buy our own copy.  It is one of my husbands favorites, and that says a lot, considering he is an &#34;old guns and car wrecks&#34; type of movie guy.
0765325950|5.0|A Memory of Light is an excellent conclusion to the best fantasy series I've read to date.  Slogging through the slower books in the series is rewarded by a great ending.
B000VUCIZO|4.0|With all due respect to the Great and Powerful Woz, perhaps he should've hired a ghost writer.  No offense, but this book reads pretty much exactly as Steve speaks -conversationally, and without the finesse you would expect from someone of his historical import.  He is enthusiastic, and has a lot of engaging nostalgic anecdotes to relay, but it feels very dumbed-down, like he's writing for 6th graders.<br /><br />Then again, maybe I've spent too long reading long-winded, bloviating poly-sci tomes.
B0085YNML2|2.0|Using your tongue you try to swing to a specific destination. The app frequently freezes up or glitches, making it difficult to enjoy or complete the levels.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show surprised me.  It's characters, both upstairs and down, are so compelling I find myself unable to stop watching.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|my son loves this game, he plays it all the time! i just wish it would work a little better for him!
B000B5XOYI|5.0|A lot of people in the entertainment industry will have mixed reviews about these movies, but I really enjoy these movies and what they have brought to the character of Batman and his world of fantastic devices and foes that he must overcome.  The many actors who have played Batman are great actors in their own right and bring a new life to the comic book character.  Some of these movies will be remembered; some may not.  But each movie in this Anthology brings new life to Batman in ways sometimes the comic book cannot.  That is what I find interesting when someone does a new movie about Batman and his fantastic world.  I recommend these movies to everyone who is a comic book fanatic and someone who is really into Batman and other super heroes like him.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I can't believe how entertaining and hilarious this movie was. I thought it would've been silly or boring. But I was wrong. Its a movie you can watch with the guys or a date. Your stomach will ache from all the laughter!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|&#34;Men in Black 3&#34; is fantastic; much better than the first 2 movies in the story and the characters involved.  The story dealing with how Will Smith's character, J, becomes more bonded with Tommy Lee Jones's character, K, is great story telling.  And Josh Brolin's interpretation of Tommy Lee Jones's character, K, is fantastic.  Its too bad that there couldn't have been a female agent, such as L in the story, but maybe in &#34;Men in Black 4(?).  Anyway, another reminder; if anyone is looking for a fantastic and comedic look at how certain individuals are protecting our planet need look no further than this movie
B007FXLZ9K|5.0|If you're reading this review then you probably have the taste for an independent film... watch it.<br />The movie is full of silence, like negative space in a painting.  When voices speak they bring texture.<br />If I had to boil it down to a comparison, it's a bit like \\"Lost in Translation\\" meets \\"Requiem for a Dream\\".<br />If that sounds interesting... kick back and enjoy.
B000NA28IE|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theatres, I knew I had to see it to see how the visual effects people handled the idea of a boy becoming a friend to a dragon and them becoming good friends in their pursuit of life and being a good force for good in their world of fantastic adventures.  The actors were fantastic in their portrayals of the people at that time and the story was excellent in its telling.  I really enjoyed watching this movie in the theatres and now enjoy owning the movie on DVD to watch whenever I choose.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have had such a fun time with this game. The hidden object adventures are challenging without being tedious. And the extra puzzles are great fun. A great game for a rainy day.
B00004YRQA|5.0|This item was packaged beautifully, and is in perfect condition! Works great, and I would definitely recommend this to all the rest of us who still rock the PS2!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel Washington did yet another perfect job.  This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning.  I highly recommend watching this.  The action at the beginning is amazing and the unfolding of the pilots life comes out and has you wondering what will happen next.  I thought this was fantastic.
B0040I09RM|5.0|it's like the Sopranos on motorcycles! I could not wait to see what would happen next. the actors are great!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book had a lot of medical terminology in it that I could have skipped over, but overall, it was a very good book.
B004I744AS|5.0|My sister and I enjoy doing the daily crossword puzzle in the paper while traveling.  I downloaded this app so we could easily look up words w/o taking a large dictionary along.  It's really easy to use and very user-friendly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are ok time consuming to unlock new one which is the point but some games are not all that fun. but it was free.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app on my kindle.  I can instantly get the local weather forcast.  I like that there is a map of the area on it also..it's easy to use and very handy to have at your fingertips.
B004TI5N38|5.0|excellent story, but Baldacci is my favorite story teller as he does not take forever to tell the story with excessive detail
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I would tell everyone to watch this...you will love it and love it.......love it....Denzel is the best .....and better and better....!!!!!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I have now read all three of her books and can say I almost didn't read this one, thinking it would be hard to get through. I loved it and look forward to her next book.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I ordered this game over the weekend and spent the majority of the weekend trying to beat my hig score.  It is a fun and challenging game.  Easy to learn!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|great!!  continues to be well written, well acted, and many surprises.  Will continue to watch until the end of the series.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|Prior to this book, I have read 2 other David Mitchell titles - The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, and Black Swan Green. Cloud Atlas is a far more complicated and challenging narrative that either of those. It requires a great deal of work on the part of the reader to keep delving into new layers as the book progresses. New time periods, new voices, new stories. Just as you have gotten the context and the story stream, the book jumps to another. The payoff comes, then, as you work your way back out from the futuristic core, and work your way back through the layers of known narratives and language. Whew! It is a challenge well worth the effort. He plays with language, he plays with the meaning of narrative, he consistently raises questions of power and slavery and personal will. I continue to be in awe of David Mitchell.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Me and my sisters like it when are cousin's were playing it from then we fell in love with the game
B009ZQ7M1U|4.0|This movie gives an appreciation for the challenges of inner-city school teachers.  The acting was also great.  I would recommend this movie.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|The only book I had ever read by him before was The Moonstone, and that was many years ago.  I forgot how good he was.  I  read this at this time because of its mention in Nora Ephron's  I Feel Bad About My Neck.  A great read, even now, more than 160 years after it was written.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I am on my third round. There are lots of interesting places to explore and the puzzles are fun. I would definitely recommend this game to all those hidden object game fans. I certainly hope there is going to be a sequel,  or at least more games like this one.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|Our kids loved this movie and now the kids I sit love it. Know our grandson will love it as well.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|great have watched seasons 1-7 and liked every one of them looking for season 8 all of them<br />hope i get all of season 8
B007ZD17XO|5.0|It keeps me hopping. I couldn`t get this before. I wouldn't allowed to download it on a  community p c. Now I'm getting down to business. I have plaued it forover an hour. At least before I go to bed in an hour or so
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I literally could not put this book down and read the entire thing in a few days. It is excellently written and the plot line and characters are very thoroughly thought out. Initially I was a bit put out by the letter writing style but the story it tells is so evocative you move past that very quickly. It's a heavy book with a hectic conclusion but so so worth it!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Intrigueing.  This one I highly recommend.  It kept me involved and I still remember the story after several weeks.  That is an accomplishment as I tend to dismiss alot after the read.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|Sad that it deals with the evils of war, but a great book that shows the ugliness of war in general.<br /><br />As a Nigerian, it serves as a teaching tool about the Biafran War.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Good book but a little slow with heavy, historical detail in some sections.  The parts which describe the main characters are much more interesting.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Worth the hour or 2 of time spent reading, would enjoy reading further into it if Brandon decides to add to it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I very much enjoy reading stories of World War ll and have read many. This book was one of a couple I have read recently that speaks of the tragedy on the other side of the lines. How people suffer no matter which side they are on. The first person voice of death was an interesting choice for the storytelling and the character was quite an admirable one. Very wise beyond her years with her pursuit of words and the use of them for the comfort of those around her.
B003B02PFO|5.0|was into when the book started . About 4/5 of the way into it the character takes a turn. Becomes a pusssy cat. Did'nt like that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutely love this show.  Our grown children turned my husband and I on to it.  My only complaint is it should be included in Amazon Prime.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Gostei do livro, autora escreve bem, você não quer lagar o livro, pois fica esperando o que acontecerá com os personagens. interessante!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book will make you laugh, cry...Auggie is a WONDERful little dude. What a great story to share with your kids.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game became addictive and if I got stuck my college age son gave me a hand.  We both enjoy it.  Like being able to get more levels once you complete a level.  Also you can go back and redo levels to make them perfect or just because you feel like it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin is a master story teller.  I couldn't put it down, I even bought the professional narration to listen to on the way to work.  Amazing way to spend the commute.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I don't like it when tiles are difficult to read after awhile my eyes feel strained. I removed this from my kindle.
B008IBP24C|5.0|Love the entire series! Got in on it late, so I was playing catch up. The characters were so believable.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love that you can play quest or classic.  Tiles are easy to see.  I created different players so I could improve y scores (hopefully) and see where i still need improvement.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This product was quickly received in perfect condition.  It worked as expected. The transaction was very easy . Thanks Amazon.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Totally engrossing drama about a priviledged family and their servants whose roles become more and more confused during  World War I.  Lush sets plus endearing as well as evil characters immeshed in a myriad of riveting subplots will keep you entertained for many hours.  You will be reminded of Upstairs, Downstairs and even Brideshead Revisited where trivial interests give way to the tackling of real human problems.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A beautiful love story.  I am now at a loss for reading material.  I have never devoured books like I have in this fifty shades trilogy.  What started out as a smut novel has turned full circle and captured my heart.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|My complaint about Grisham is that he doesn't finish his stories well, as if he loses interest at the end. I know everyone is a critic, but I know what I like, and weak endings are annoying. Still a good read.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The binaural beats are the best way to fall into a world of peaceful and happy dreams. I highly recommend this application for anyone suffering insomnia!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel was terrific in this picture of a great, but flawed man. Kept me intrigued from beginning to end. You will not be disappointed.
B008L1F91A|5.0|The new 52 is amazing, great price and wonderful detail. As a superman fan sence 1998, this superman statue exceeds all my expectations and a little more as do all the others from the new 52 that I will have sooner or later. Thanks for such amazing work.
B005IQZB14|3.0|The writer takes an introspective look at herself, warts and all.<br />It is a well written story, I enjoyed reading it, but about 3/4 through<br />I was wishing it would end.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I felt this book would be more of interest to teenagers (I'm 70). It was a good read but after dragging through the first half, I started skipping to get to the end. A shorter version would be more interesting,
1936608618|5.0|Great crossfit program. Very similiar to military programs. Includes great instruction on techniques for all multi sport. It is a broad spectrum how to.
B000I9S64U|5.0|...but the options were if I liked the movie or if I loved it. This is more of a staple movie between my brother and I since we grew up watching it on a worn out VHS. I really not the best adaptation of the book (the book is amazing btw), but I still love this moving. Worth watching if your a fan or a sci-fi junky.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Once I started watching, I couldn't stop. It was uncomfortable, sexy, strange and just about the best new show I've watched in years. I was invested in each character's personal story, a bit of a voyeur, and sometimes you don't always like what you see but you just can't stop watching.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever super super super awesome<br />Like a boss I say<br />Like a boss I<br />Like a boss<br />Like a<br />Like
B004E547D8|4.0|Not the best movie in the world but definitely an enjoyable guilty pleasure movie. Good actors, decent plot, fun movie.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|This novella is now one of my favorites. It's short, addicting, and it's hard to stop reading once it's over. It's not for the light hearted, however. If you are sensitive when it comes to gang violence and the like, I wouldn't recommend this book. With that said, if you can handle it, I highly recommend this novella; it's wonderful!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is such a great show - the stories are gripping and keep you wanting more.  You feel like you're part of the action, happy when the characters are happy and sad when they are sad.  Beautiful scenery, great acting, and great writing.  Very, very enjoyable show.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|God bless you! You are an amazing hero and each and everyone of us deserve to give you thanks for all you have done
0525951652|5.0|Another great one by Follett.  1 2 3 6 5 4 7 8 9 8 7 4 5 6 3 2 1
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is a riveting story of second chances and truly touched me with the amount and simplicity of love expressed in every gesture between Alex and Katie. It kept me entertained, too, with a side of terror and a glimpse into an unstable mind. This book completely deserves the five stars I gave it. I chose this book because I wanted a story that was new and exciting, and I found it. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody younger than thirteen, because I feel it takes an aged mind to truly understand and appreciate all the twists and turns and the quality of this story.
0525952926|5.0|I love Follett and this book is excellent but it smells as though it was next to an ashtray, then used as an ashtray, and then mated with an ashtray.  I had to let it air out for a month and can now read it, but still smells like the Marlboro Man's backhouse.
B00A6D5GBE|1.0|The game would not open on my tablet so I wouldn't recommend this game download to any one.  If it opens on your device, it could/or couldn't be a good game
B00005N6KG|2.0|Sound was crackling and the band part of headphones was so flimsy they barely stayed in place. I gave them to a friend and she uses them with her Kindle and loves them. They didn't work well with my ipod to use at the gym.
B009GEDP26|5.0|I would give this series and also series 1-4 one hundred stars if I could awesome show enjoy every aspect of this show.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I have read 4 books by this author so far and love all of them. He is a very gifted writer.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Arrived on time. Packaging was good. This was a gift for my great nephew who loves legos and watches, so how could you go wrong!
B008EEBBIY|5.0|I got turned onto Family of the Year when they opened for Milo Greene.  It was an awesome concert, and it made me want to get their album.  After seeing them again on Jimmy Kimmel, I saw that their album was cheap, and I knew the music would be awesome so I bought it.  I recommend it 100%!
B00821PCJS|4.0|If you like post-apocalyptic shows, this is a good one to choose. IT's got aliens and explosions. The special effects are pretty good too.
B004T0E2S8|4.0|Great on my phone... but any time I try to search for a song on my tablet it crashes... please try and fix this.
B0084670FU|1.0|It came free with our prime subscription and that was too much to pay for it. The biggest joke is on the title page.. &#34;Brad Bitt's Best Film&#34;
B00683JK9K|3.0|Haven't had any problems with it. Not enough puzzles to play. The hardest level is really too difficult for a Kindle's smaller screen.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My wife and I watched this flick a couple weeks ago and loved it. Considering the sea of ho hum flicks out there, this one was well worth the watch. Is it funnier than Bridesmaids? No. Is it more moving than Lincoln? Negativo. Will I name my first born Pitch? Don't be stupid. But if you like Glee or other musicals, I think you're predetermined to enjoy this ride. ** Spoiler alert ** Beware the projectile vomit if you're a reflex vomiter or overly sensitive to things like that.<br /><br />&#34;Make good choices!&#34;
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|Terrible game. Waste of time. Good thing it was free or I'd feel ripped off. Yes, this game was THAT bad.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|What's with these crazy-long car chases? You're not fooling anyone. I'm starting to think it's written in the script:<br /><br />[Amazing car chase sequence, wrap up film 5 minutes after, leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth]<br /><br />Jeremy Renner deserves better than this.<br /><br />Watch anything else that shows the slightest glimmer of superiority.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I recently became hooked on PPL. This season is amazing. I rushed home from social events and such just to watch as many episodes as I could until 2am. The story line is amazing. It flows incredibly well together which each upcoming episode,never feels as if they had to add something to pass the time. The girls you get to know as well as their relationships,its like you are in their group feeling all the emotions and drama as well. Recommend to all my friends because this show is awesome and suspenseful.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|loved this book,a very easy  read and loveable characters.was surprised by how good this book was,have recomended to a few friends and will be to more also
B009CCBCU4|3.0|I WAS NEVER ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE CHARACTERS AS TO WHETHER THEY WERE FROM THE MOUNTAINS  OR FROM THE VALLEY!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|oh i just loved this book,a very easy read and you really cant put it down,great characters in it also
0395389496|5.0|Came with two great unique items which really helped make the book special! Such a great book! So happy I bought this!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great game, very addictive, challenging, and actually relaxing to play. There, I've done my duty and reviewed it. Now please crank out more levels before I go through withdrawals.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great app. I would highly reccomend it. there are plenty of games that are either kid or adult friendly
0425252868|5.0|I found this book hard to put down as it chronicled the story of two extraordinary men and their experiences during World War II.  I was particularly taken by the story of Franz Stigler as he flew throughout the entire war from North Africa to the final fall of Berlin.  The people that he flew with and their experiences were told in vivid detail so that you are able to see them as individuals with personal stories...some noble, some not.  The book provided great insight into the struggles that war forces on men and how human qualities sometimes are able to overcome great hardship.  A remarkable book!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|With all three books I couldn't put them down, I'm mad I've finished so quickly. Hope there's a new one soon
B000FC10WU|5.0|I have read almost all of Agatha Chritie's books and always enjoy them a lot.  This one is no exception.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Program is far out weird but you can't stop watching...I'm in the second season and it's getting a little repeticious.
B0095P33IW|5.0|It was a pretty awesome story! Enough for us to watch a second time and then some. Well worth the time to watch.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|This was an okay concert and way better musically than the movie made this year with Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway but I believe the 10th anniversary version was better.  Some stars in this rendition, like Norm Lewis as Javert, were outstanding.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|What can I say.  Adobe Acrobat rocks .pdfs on your Mac, PC, phone, and tablet. Set the standard, lead the pack.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it because it is a fresher way of running.Also if you get bored of just yellow coins there's also red coins!!!
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|DI.fm is the go-to source for electronic dance music, and their app. allows you to take all the trance, psy, hard dance, and euro you need to keep your day bumpin'.
0765357151|5.0|They made a movie that captured almost nothing of what this novel is really about. This is the author that Stephen King learned from. Honestly, I read this book 10 years ago and it still haunts me. I see echoes if it in things in the news and things I experience in my own life. It is about much more than vampires and, in that way, will be around long after the twilights and crap have all gone out of fashion.
B0089XH38M|5.0|AVG provides easy-to-use, unobtrusive anti-virus protection, and doesn't get in the way of your other apps or what you're doing.
B00APJLX8E|3.0|This movie was so predictable, but entertaining for 5 to 10 year olds. Loved Adam Sandlers character. Glad I rented from Amazon vs. Purchase or paid the ticket price at a theater.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I personally do not enjoy the readings of this time period.  It was to hard for me to follow and enjoy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|i recommend this book to everyone!! slow in the beginning but so crazy at the end. there are so many jaw dropping moments in this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Cool beans awesome book impressed a b c d e f g h I j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book absolutely became my favorite book. I think that the author did a fantastic job. I would recommend it to young adults rather than younger kids.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is an amazing app. Its a great app to just find things you are interested in, or even discover new things.There are minimal glitches; so it makes it easy to pin many things in a short time. The Kindle version is all in all better than the version I have on my iPod. I am very suprised that this app is free, because it would be worth<br /> spending money on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing! You can enjoy it with friends and family which makes it way better! I can play with my Facebook friends too.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Now I understand why everyone loves this show! Can't wait to watch the other seasons. Hope I find the time to do so soon.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe captures me with the characters! The Science is intriguing and a little gruesome! But there is nothing better then Walter digging into a dead body and asking for food! And the Walter/Peter banter takes the edge off the seriousness of the show.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|After reading a few reviews I thought this game was worth trying. I am glad I did.<br /> It has the right stuff.
0345803485|4.0|Received this in a timely fashion. Good price, good read. I have just ordered the second book to read. Going to give the first one to a friend
B0054JZC6E|4.0|hmm I just started playing but so far so good I don't know if the game's get harder or not but very simple right now not so sure I like that for me but perfect for my daaughter
B009IF8CH6|5.0|My daughter and I can't wait til Thrusdays to see new episodes.  We love all seasons!!!!  We watch them all the time!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|It's not exactly like the movie - they changed up a few of the songs and like another reviewer has already said, I wished they had included some of Becca's remixes. All in all it's a fun listen,
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is one of my favorite games to play. I like the style of the game. The animation is good.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|The songs are the same as those in the movie. Amazingly Tom Cruise's voice holds it's own - even without his screen presence. It's a fun listen.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i think subway surfers is very interesting. its  not exactly like temple  run. i like both of them so yea
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE this game in stead of three monkeys there is a giant daddy monkey.I highly think that everyone should install this game.
B006BXT4TI|5.0|love this band, love this album, totally worth the small amount I paid compared to itunes or another website for music downloads
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Totally enjoyed the book. Kept me interested all the way through. Would recommend to others . Was good reading totally.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was a good story but not as good as the story in book 1. I liked it and still recommend it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Addicting, great show, I found it late and watched all seasons back to back, couldn't stop.  Definitely not for the squeamish!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard how great this drama was from several friends, so I decided to watch the episodes. My daughter and I could not peel ourselves from the sofa watching the shows. The story line is great and the fashion is fantastic to look at. I have been recommending that others watch it as well.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Unlike most albums, this one contains a bunch of great diverse songs.  Great del here on Amazon as well.  Get this one
B00B1MHA18|4.0|Not harper's finest album, but there are a few diamonds! He and Charlie really work well with each other. You won't regret purchasing this.
B008IBPMZG|3.0|tea and crumpets. long winded and overfly dramatic. should have left them to their fate in wwii. not impressed by any character
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've had this installed on my Kindle Fire for quite a while now and I absolutely love it. It's great to be able to slide down the notification bar and see my battery life visually. Before I had to go into the options and Device... what a hassle. I haven't encountered any problems whatsoever.
B007HJ9NBE|1.0|if you saw the original, don't for a second think that this is any sort of compliment. bad music versions, and even worse dancing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love this book. It was a good read. I couldn't put it down until finished. Can't wait to see the movie! You can't go wrong with any of Sparks books.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Everything was great when I first got the app- then after a week it started to glitch horribly:( I could'nt even play the game because it would start to skip and you die. I could'nt even control it anymore. But if glitches stop this game is AWESOME!!!!
0061478784|5.0|I'm not even kidding. I love this book with my soul.<br /><br />It's funny, but it's intelligent and the protagonist isn't the stereotype and yet she's exactly the stereotype. She's a scary mirror in a world filled with magic and scarily accurate people. There's something about this book, that makes me go weak at the knees.<br /><br />It's a fantasy world but the characters are all too familiar, their fatal flaws are so human and annoyingly understandable that you can't hate them no matter how desperately you want to. Howl makes me love him, he literally forces me to love him and wish that he were real when he's only portrayed as selfish and vain; things that should make me detest him. I mean, seriously, I named my cat after him.<br /><br />But apart from the fact that I'm seriously in love with Howl and Sophie, I love the plot line and that it's complicated and you don't pick it before it's revealed, but it isn't overdone and it makes sense in the end. And even though you want more when it's over it's because it was a seriously good read, not because there wasn't enough in the novel.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many times I have read this novel, and I have to admit, seen the anime based on it. I actually saw the anime first and it was only in a special feature on the dvd that I realised that it had been a book first, and being one of those types of people I instantly needed to read it. And was so wonderfully surprised when the book was a hundred times better than the anime. I feel as if the two works stand side by side, different paths for similar themes and characters. The anime's Howl is much more redeemable than the book's Howl, because Howl isn't quite as flawed in the anime but the imagery that accompanies the story makes the anime a beautiful experience.<br /><br />Whereas the book is meatier and cleverer, and is a real book. A book that you know was written to be a book, not one of so many that are written these days in the hopes that it will get picked up and made into a movie. It's an old fashioned story, meant to be read and savoured.<br /><br />Diana Wynne Jones (in the words of my niece) is my fav'rit!up and made into a movie. It's an old fashioned story, meant to be read and savoured.<br /><br />Diana Wynne Jones (in the words of my niece) is my fav'rit!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it! I could not put the book down. I cant wait for the final book of the trilogy. Must read
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful. I have had so much fun watching this show and talking to the other women in my family about it.
B00A861QMM|4.0|A good playable game. The demo was good. I have not bought the full game yet. It has a good story line.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|There aren't really words to describe how fantastic this book is.  People have been recommending it to me for ages, and now that I've finally devoured it, I know why!  Not only is it an entertaining autobiography from a really interesting character, it's a master class in the craft of writing.  I'll be digesting and using King's suggestions and guidelines for years!
B005EWDA3I|1.0|This book is full of imaginary Little People, skies with two moons, mysterious female killers,a policewoman into anonymous sex and sadism, and other assorted --and totally unbelievable-- nonsense. It is not particularly well written -- or perhaps the translation is bad-- but there are frequent misplaced modifiers and other grammatical boo-boos that a modern reader does not expect in a serious work of fiction. I read it on my Kindle, which is usually a pleasure, because the Kindle is so light and easy to carry, but every time I started to advance in this tedious tome I felt as if I was lifting a load of cement.<br /><br />I did not finish it; I could not finish it.  It is a load of self-serious nonsense, and it truly astonishes me that this book is such an international best seller.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I’ve known about Ender’s Game for years and I even started to read it once over ten years ago.  I don’t know why I put it down back then.  I was blown away by the world Orson Scott Card creates in this book.  I was so tied to the emotions of the characters and the choices that they made and that were made for them, that I could hardly put it down.  And when I got to the end, not gonna lie, I wept.  This is an amazing book!
0385536828|3.0|He had me at 'Amsterdam',  'Black Dogs' was pretty macabre, 'The Comfort of Strangers' downright scary, 'Enduring Love' ever so slightly creepy, 'Atonement' divine. Then this. So, yes, admittedly it has been some 11 years since 'Atonement' was published and he has published four novels since then, none of which I have read. My mistake perhaps.<br /><br />What I loved about those earlier novels was the compactness and perfection of the writing: with the exception of 'Atonement' they are all short books. So much was said in so few words. 'Atonement' is longer than this novel, but an awful lot happened in that story over quite a long period of time, plus the story was told from the perspective of a number of different characters. It touched me. This novel - none of those things.<br /><br />There is a huge amount on the net about the autobiographical bits and pieces in this story and the significance or otherwise of that, plus plenty of over-analysis of time and place and characters. But the upshot for me is that it is far too long - the main character, Serena Frome, drones on endlessly,I felt little or no engagement with any of the characters or with the story for that matter, and for the length of the book very little actually happens. In short, very disappointing.<br /><br />I did love the setting however, and the author's writing of it. Set in London, early 1970s, middle of the Cold War, troubles with the unions, British Government in chaos, oil crisis, all sorts of trouble in Ireland, the author conveys the uncertainty and worry of the average Brit with the possibility of heating cuts, petrol rationing, where will the IRA strike next, job security, being overtaken by Communists. A wealth of material to write a novel about spies, espionage and double crossing. But 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' it aint.<br /><br />Serena is a most unlikely heroine. Smart and well educated without being brilliant, pretty without being stunningly beautiful, product of an Anglican bishopand closet-feminist mother, keen to get ahead in life, she is probably typical of many girls of her middle class upbringing at this time. She is young, so love and romance rank pretty highly in her small universe. She has an affair with a much older Cambridge professor, which leads her into working for the intelligence service. She finds herself as a pawn in the long game, code name 'Sweet Tooth', of MI5 nurturing the writing talent of an up and coming writer, Tom Haley. Naturally they fall in love, naturally the whole things unravels. End of story, and, a la McEwan, with a twist.<br /><br />So not much more to be said really. Other than the writing of Serena's target Tom  Haley, which I thought was the best writing in the whole book - short stories within the novel. They are all the things those earlier novels of McEwan's are that I have read - touching on the dark side of human nature. Creepy, macabre, weird, brilliant. If only there was more of this in the book instead of all the rambling, introspective, precious thought processes of Serena's brain.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely enjoyed the series, so good I purchased it!! I would highly recommend in fact I had my friend to watch it.
0062238868|5.0|Bought this book for my son and he loved it, he is a Chris Kyle fan and has passed this book on to friends!
1572814349|5.0|I use to read the tarot back in 2004 where under unusual cirmcumstances gave it up and gave all away and now I am back with my first purchase &#34;The Golden Tarot&#34;, which I love, love, love. You know in a sense every tarot cart has to fit the individuals needs and personality, and I feel this one fits mine in deed. Love it. I think you'll love yours too, Sincerely, Elizabeth G.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was a wonderful, wonderful book!!! I started reading it after dinner and could not go to bed until I had read the entire thing! I never cry at books, but this one got me over and over. The happy parts made me cry more than the hard times because after reading everything she went through it made me so happy to know that she not only survived, but overcame! Jaycee's story proves that no matter how horrible your situation is, there is ALWAYS hope for a better future ahead so long as you are strong enough to surivive your way to it and not give up! Despite everything that happened to her, Jaycee has embraced life and celebrates it through helping others. Jaycee is such a strong, courageous, inspiring person and I am so glad that she chose to share her story with the world.
B005HF0BIE|2.0|While the cinematography and costume design is to be applauded the screenplay relies heavily on the viles of King Henry VIII. After watching Season 1 , one can easily predict that that those most close to the King are sure to be sentenced towards the end of the season.<br /><br />This production has the ability to loose its charm as you go through the episodes.
B003W5C0VC|5.0|I love it! great movie! prompt service! so much better than ManHunter! boyfriend loved the it! I would definitely reccomend this item.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Love batman and had to have this movie. Had the graphic novel from back when and glad that they made into a movie
B000002KHF|4.0|Ah... The incomparable Van Morrison! Another classic album I needed to replace and be able to play in the car.
B00BESM14U|3.0|Some good moments, definitley worth renting.Cast was great and they storey took me to places I didn't expect. I would reccomend it.
B0038AUY96|3.0|Tightly written, but not suspenseful enough. Was a great introduction into Jo Nesbo's writing, however - I have read several since
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I watched it twice. Great story, great effects, Javier Bardam is exceptional, Ralph Fiennes as the new head of Mi6. This one is a hit from the opening scene to the ending. Loved it
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love the casting, the storyline and the unexpected twists! I always recommended this show to my friends and family!
B001NLKXK2|3.0|Interesting topic.  It was a quick read for me. Happy ending helps to deal with difficult subject matter. I'd recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great, but recently I cant get in the game it starts but closes right out. But its still a great game. I really love temple run 2 though despite the app crashing on me.
B0011TMGKG|5.0|I have attached it to the bouncy chair and my 7 week baby is grabbing at it. Love the design and bright colours. A well made product.
0525425578|5.0|My son has really enjoyed this series. I have all of Grisham's adult book. I was glad to see him enter the teen reads.
B0011ZVOBC|5.0|This album is one that I first purchased upon release when I was a teen. I love the storyline this album has from begining to end. The rise and fall of the machines and the concouring human spirit. If your not familiar with Fear Factory I would recommend this album, it will make you a fan for sure!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This CD is great like a mix of prince and Michael. Jackson and Bob Marley in all like being back in the 80's
B0088W4YTK|5.0|In Season 3 SGA really stepped up character development. The interaction between Sheppard and McKay becomes more interesting. The Asurans are developed as a secondary enemy.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|Many laughs and zombies are always a great mix. Love Simon Pegg and the fat man, they have made a lot of films together and this one is a great one. I am sure you will have a great time watching SHAUN
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Every chapter was a new discovery! I couldn't put the book down. It has ghe perfect amount of everything. Loved the ending!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Make this a movie. I'm definitely reading more of her!<br />Hit home with me and I couldn't really put it down
B006TJXZ30|5.0|This APP has made my Kindle so useable! Easily imported my Laptop based email addresses, and functions almost seamlessly with lap top.
B002TWWOHE|5.0|Each episode is autonomous, but there are enough little details to draw you in and give the characters the right amount of intrigue.
B009JBZH54|5.0|3 movies of batman.All 3 are totally awesome.On blueray ,comes in crystal clear.These  3 are the best batman movies. :^)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read! Loved it! A Nicholas sparks classic! Can't wait for the movie. Would recommend this book to a friend.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this on my tablet almost every night.  Sometimes I win and sometimes I dont.  Oh well keep trying.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is addicting and really enjoyment it is good for any age my six year old granddaughter loves this app worth the free price I even pay for it.so just give it a try if you don't like it just delete it back off no harm in trying it
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Sounded better than it was. Not a bad story but kind of predictable.  Interesting premise but not all that exciting.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was a real page turner! I highly recommend this to my friends and family.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey is hilarious and you will not be disappointed in this book.  If you like Chelsea Handler's books you will like this.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|the series as a whole is pretty mindless entertainment, but that was what I was looking for. I didn't expect the third installment to be as good as it was. If you liked the first two you will like this one.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Loved<br /><br />this book, once I started reading, it was hard to put down!<br /><br />Great read, how about I never knew Shirley had a daughter!  After reading this book it really makes you aware of what we never knew!
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Fantastic album; an awesome wave. Wow, some of the best music I've heard in years. Listen to it while driving, while working, while reading a book on my Fire... it's a great experience. Matilda, Bloodflood make me feel the most, but the whole album is a work of art. Pure pleasure. Breathe in, exhale.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|There is an old story of a fanatical golfer whose partner died on the 10th hole.  After returning to the clubhouse, he shares with his other buddies the fact of his golf partner's death.  When asked what he did after his partner died he said, &#34;There was nothing else I could do; it was hit the ball and drag Charley!&#34;  That's how I feel about getting through this book.  I read the other four of Martin's books and so I wanted to finish the series.  But I must say, this one is a chore.  I want to get it done to merely to be able to say, &#34;I read them all&#34; so I read for awhile and then switch over to another book just as a change of pace.  I come back, read a few more chapters and then find another book to read for awhile.  But I swear to you, the reader, I plan to finish it someday.
B00AVTMCYW|2.0|If you're older than 17, avoid this at all costs. They've stuffed every high school, coming-of-age movie plot device / cliche / stereotype into this thing. Slow, implausible, predictable, and tries way too hard to be \\"deep\\" (\\"I feel like I'm infinite\\" - ugh. And people standing in the back of pickup trucks riding through tunnels). Lost track of the number of times I literally rolled my eyes at some of the dialog and events. In a word, brutal.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you are a history buff and want to known more about the first world war, this is a good way to become more knowledgeable.  It is engaging, full of surprises and Follett's technique of using different families to tell the war's history story keeps you from becoming bored having to wade through a series of time-lines, factoids and names (like I had to during my college Western Civilization class).
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|Very enjoyable. The story line and the actors are awesome.  Highly recommend adding this dvd to any ones movie collection.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follet keeps the old characters from his first book and adds their respective children as foils for his narrative this time on the second world war. After reading both, I consider his first book in this series to be better.  I think Follett tried to cover/skim over too much (I realize WW II had more that needed to be covered i.e. European and Pacific theaters) in order to get it all in.  As a result, although I liked it, it seemed less engaging than his first one.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Modern day love story that is a must see.  If this movie doesn't touch your heart then there isn't any movie that will.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  The plot was intriguing, and the surprise ending really made it special.  Denzel Washington was the perfect choice as the Captain.
B003QS9VYE|5.0|A great classic.  It has all the depth, artistry and wit of Fantasia. It was one of the first, if not the first, of the great Disney musicals.
B006LS7DQE|3.0|Playing this on a Kindle Fire HD:<br /><br />The game doesn't appear to want you to play it.  The big appeal of Puzzle Quest 1 for me was how simple it was to enter a combat round with an enemy and how fun that combat was.  Simple with a mixture of Dungeons and Dragons/Classic RPG.  It was a fun, simple puzzle game that would keep anyone that's a fan of Bejeweled playing for hours.<br /><br />However,  Puzzle Quest 2 lacks all the simplicity of it's former title.  Convoluted maps, confusing upgrade/equipment system.  Boring abilities, tough learning curve.  And worst of all? The loading screens.  Every combat is greeted with a loading screen before and after which sometimes take longer than the combat itself.<br />Sometimes entering something as simple as combat in the game involved a fifteen minute effort.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Puzzle Quest 1, just avoid this title.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The movie was great, better than the last two Bond's. They have finally put back the bit of humor the past movies had. As for the picture quality, renting the digital on demand was awful! It seems the free movies are perfect, you pay and suddenly the resolution disappears! along with your money!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Enthralling tothe end! held me captive for hours on end. A sleeper of a read and would make a great movie!
0385523912|5.0|History has its horrors--too many to count.  The lives of North Koreans, and the pain that they suffer, deserve attention.  This is not a happy read--but it is an important one.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Masterpiece Theatre is always exceptional.  I purchased the HDMI cable (from amazon.com of course) for my Kindle HD and it  just increased the awesome experience of this show to the big screen!
0230754686|4.0|Harden shows us how difficult life is inside North Korea's notorious camps.  This is a must read for those who want to know about the &#34;Hermit Kingdom.&#34;
B007THA4FI|4.0|Definitely was nothing like like the harry potter books as promised.  Good for a mindless beach read but thats about it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I would recomend this app to everyone. We really enjoy the Kindle Fire&#62; I have only had success buying from Amazon
1595141979|5.0|i love the whole series of vampire academy books! it was in great condition & i couldn't put it down!
1583334386|5.0|I love psychology and learning how the brain works. I didn't get this book in order to self-help a problem I had. It just sounded interesting and had good reviews so I bought an audio version to listen to. I was amazed by all that I learned. It is a great book for ANYBODY and I regret not having come across it sooner! It's life-changing and you can read it over and over and learn something new every time. You really gain a new perspective and see (and understand) yourself and others in a different light.
B003B02O14|5.0|Loved this book. But I love all John Grisham books!!!! This one had a lot of twists and turns which kept me guessing!
B009GX69RK|5.0|Even better than the first season. My favorite comedy second only to Psych. :) A lot of the jokes will catch you by surprise and make you laugh out loud.
B008MEM24S|4.0|this app is really fun and enjoying all levels but the doofenshmirts evil incorporated is in the game but It takes a while to download so it didn't work I would like it to be a seperate app so it could be easier.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book. I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to have a girl's night to  see the movie.
0739441671|5.0|Easy reading.I'm only partly done , but it's because I read it when I am waiting for my wife after work .
B0058DRUV6|5.0|The sections of this book are logical, flow together and implement the data seamlessly with the stories.  I really appreciated the insight into the methodology to provide a background regarding the results.  There is a lot of great information, the difficulty will be to apply it and not lose sight of some of the insight in the day-to-day.
0553801473|1.0|SPOILERS (in the last paragraph)<br /><br />I literally just finished reading this book and I have to say, I've never been more disappointed over a fantasy series in my life.  Seriously, what did I just put myself through?  The story development crawls along at a snail's pace and just like the 4th book in the series, nothing really happens.  If you're planning on reading both the 4th and 5th book of GOF, my advice would be to just read the bible instead.  Their content is equally interesting (not at all) and they're pretty comparable in length.<br /><br />I was really hoping George Martin had like an epic, masterful layout for this series, and still clung on to that hope after reading \\"A Feast for Crows.\\"  I just kept telling myself, \\"ok, he's expanding on new characters because over half the original characters are dead.\\"  But, as it turns out, he's totally winging it.  And whats worse, he's milking this story for every penny its worth by including meaningless details such as in-depth descriptions of meals (seriously, we don't need to know every single aspect of every characters breakfast or supper on every single chapter) and baths and reoccuring lines like : \\"You know nothing Jon Snow.\\"  Or \\"I must remember my name is Reek it rhymes with meek.\\"<br /><br />And Jon Snow dies?  Are...you...freaking... kidding...me.  And not by one the others.  Not by a wilding, a giant, or a mammoth, or anything cool.  He just gets stabbed by one of his brothers or queens men or one of the other 250 plus characters thrown at you.  Don't get me wrong, part of George Martin's appeal to me was his insensitivity towards the reader and his willingness to kill off main characters.  But the death of Jon Snow was the death of the last cool stark and, for me, the last reason to read any further.  A 1500 page book and the only real thing that happens is my favorite character dies...unbelievable.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The subject matter was very depressing.  Not enteraining at all.  All about drugs and alcohol.  Hope it is not true about pilots!<br /><br />However, Denzel Washington acted well in the role.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the variety of noises. I also love that you can play multiple ones at a time. I appreciate that you do not notice the sound loop which is a big deal for me.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|enjoyed a look at the way life might have been at the turn of the century. While it's not a historical documentary, I think it captures a bit of what was going on in England among the landed gentry and the changes they were faced with. The actors are skillled at their craft. Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville are my favorites.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movie is really well done.  A period action horror movie- it's really fun!  I am going to host a movie night with this and Spielberg's Lincoln as soon as I can get it on DVD.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Awsome game play with great graphics, but slow play because you have to make so many facebook entries to get enough credits to continue.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|A typical Jack Reacher Story. Good plot, plenty of humour. Good reading for entertainment and you'll pick up some knew knowledge here and there especially about contemporary telecom gadgets.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I have read the first book Fifty Shades of Grey and thought it a little over the edge but this book is one sex scene after another and really over does it until you want the parts in between the sex to be longer. I just ended up feeling sorry for everyone in the book and even sorry for the author as it just seemed she had good ideas but could not flesh them out without the same sex scene she had written before .
B00A757EFW|5.0|It's easy & fun, much easier than the original.  My grandson showed me some tricks that make winning a bit easier.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|OK right from the start this book is about a little virgin girl who gets caught up with a sadistic sex addict. she really likes him no matter what he wants her to do minus a few exceptions because he is the most handsome , most well built man God has ever given to this earth and as a side line he is so rich he can buy anything or have anyone he wants.She loves him because in between the sadism he is really nice and protective towards her.  I look at this as a cautionary tale all things that look beautiful are not always so. It was a good read and if you want to read sex scenes over and over this is your book.
B009O2XY12|5.0|My grandson likes it too. It keeps him occupied and he LOVES winning.  It is a very easy game. Thanks.
B001XV09UG|4.0|I have watched this movie several times and always find something new in it. It is a strange movie and the acting by Cruse and Kidman even stranger they speak in a halting odd manner that I guess is what the director Geoarge Cukor wanted.This oddness is why I keep coming back to watch this movie over and over again.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I like this game, it was a nice mix of hidden object and simple puzzles. It took a while to complete which was nice. Good graphics easy to find objects.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game that is very fun and realistic!You can race,which is of course fun too,you can feed it,and you can even clean out its stables (and other stuff like that).
B007THA4FI|2.0|There are so many characters, many with nicknames being used interchangeably.  The author is taking so long to get to the point of the plot, I can't even finish this book although I have tried several times.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it. Was hooked by episode 2 in season 1. Best thing on TV! Interesting to see how 'the other half' lives.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Easy read, great storyline. Greek and Roman good alive in modern day. Great for pre teens, teens, and adults to read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|He is not different. Onlly his face is. He has a normal body and mind, but everyone (well actually so people respect him, in the end everyone pretty much accepts him) treats him like everything about him is different when it's only his face. Everyone's always saying &#34;don't judge a book by its cover&#34; in this story August is a book nobody bothers to open. It tells how life is for him. One thing I like that Palico added was each chapter was from a different point of view. Palico really shows how hard it is to be treated different just bh how you look.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is awesome. Although when I first started reading I was skeptical of continuing due to boredom, this book quickly picked up. From there it was me running to my kindle whenever I had spare time.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|These exercises cover all the major muscle groups and joints that my physical therapist showed me.  Especially love the legs and butt exercises, as they strengthen my hips, knees and ankles from a knee injury a few years ago. Keep up the good work!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Brought history back to a time I have ever known. Excellent acting, characters you learn to love and adore. Want more of Lark Rise to Candelford
B000VDDDVO|5.0|It wouldn't be Christmas without this movie!  An annual must-see at our our house.  What a Great Cast and Great Story Line.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is perfect for the suspense and nature.  If you like gorey, then this is it!  You will love it!
B0099114WO|1.0|I have to admit, I only watched the first ten minutes...Great Actors and Actresses do not the movie make...hope it got better after I quit watching it...makes for an unusual drink coaster.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I didn't want to get caught up, but I sure was! Writing, acting, and everything else is great. It is intelligent, too. The viewer is never quite sure which way it will turn next.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|It wouldn't be Christmas without this movie!  An annual must-see at our our house.  A Great Cast and Great Story Line.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I feel this is Susan's best album to date. Her feeling of music from the American song book is her strength, I hope she makes more albums with this music.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|Started a little slow, but really picked up shortly after. As usual, Hemingway takes the reader in and makes you feel as though you are witnessing the story as part of the cast.
B0001ARCFA|2.0|Unfortunately this product was surprisingly disappointing. I've purchase other AKG products in the past, but this headphone just did not reproduce the quality of the sound I was looking.  Some distortions in the bass frequencies.
B00796E7CA|2.0|The work is like a scholarly treatise and not a work of fiction like those written by Tolkien the Father.  The son is not the writer his father was.
B008PZZV8S|4.0|Very enjoyable movie.  As always Matt Damon is very good.  Very few movies Matt Damon is in that we would not want to watch.
0143119680|2.0|I copied that word from another review. I didn't know what to write at first, but \\"bleah\\" sums up how I feel about this book.<br /><br />I started \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" months ago, and am still trying to read it, because I do not like to give up on books. Am about two-thirds through, and it's not getting any more interesting or enjoyable.<br /><br />Can't put my finger exactly on what I don't like about it. For one thing, I suppose I've figured out that I don't like the characters. Also, it turns out that a series of advanced scholarly degrees, fine old academic settings, preppy clothing, and a number of yoga classes with diverse attendees (human an non-human alike), are not sufficient to formulate a truly engaging story.<br /><br />This book, I think, has a good deal of substance but no heart. Enjoy it if you can; I just could not. Time to bail....so many good books out there, and the time to read them is precious and limited!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything that is worth watching in a TV series and much more! Love the costumes, location, and it's hard not to fall madly in love with the characters and their stories. Can't wait for season 4
B0082RYS24|5.0|This book was very interesting and very enlightening. It was exactly what was expected and recommend it for anyone to read.
B002LE8EFQ|2.0|I was disappointed.  I love listening to Susan Boyle sing live, but the CD just doesn't have the same effect.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|This book came to light as a result of the film currently doing the rounds - but don't expect the film to reproduce your literary experience. It is different in a number of ways, much more detailed and absorbing. A sympathetic treatment of mental illness, which slowly but imperceptibly reveals the healing taking place. If you have experienced living with anyone with OCD or bipolar disorders then you will understand the agonies of the slow recovery. Beautifully written, enabling understanding of the main protoganists. Perhaps a little too much football detail for a non-Amercian, but it seems necessary for the plot. But don't expect your movie-going experience to be enhanced by reading the book beforehand - it's a different animal.
6304712944|3.0|Loved this movie when it originally came out. It is interesting to see how far film has come although performances by the greats are always a pleasure to see.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|It was a cute movie, but just a smidge too long and mildly slow moving.  The characters were all very likeable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is fantastic! Just watched the movie as well, and of course the book is much better.  There are so many more details in the book that rel you in.
B005FPT51K|4.0|Love this item!!! So much better than a reg baby monitor ... I can see my<br />Baby even when I leave the house
0425263916|5.0|Well, where do I start? I'm a huge fan of 50 Shades Trilogy! As soon as I was finished reading it I was going through with-drawls. So right away I searched &#34;Books like 50 Shades&#34; and the Crossfire series was the first books to pop up. So right away I ordered them and as soon as I received Bared to You I started reading. I finished the two books in six days. So now I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for the third book to come out, which is already pre-ordered. I personally think the story is great, although at this point I'm still loving 50 Shades more. I dont want to give anything away, so I'll stop now. All I can say is read!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Perfectly done period drama. Addictive and compelling.  Superb performances  Maggie Smith is the absolute dowager duchess and a haunting musical score.

1603420398|5.0|This book has many different motifs to try ranging from easy to difficult.  Someone needs some knowledge of basic stitches to do the motifs.  Some motifs are difficult, but stitches are demonstrated or written out and are fun to learn.  I recommend this book for anyone that loves crocheting.
B002CPMB9O|4.0|We had seen at the theatre but we really like Denzel Washington so we bought the movie to watch in our home.<br />There's more bad language in it than we like, but we deal with it to watch this movie.<br />Recommend to anyone who likes Denzel W.  The only thing:  he's a bad guy and we didn't like that part of it.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Good book. Hard to follow at times. Didn't like the ending..... Gone Girl by same author was much better and more intriguing
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Enjoyed this game so much!  I have played and played this game, it is very easy to get lost in this game .  if you little this type of game I suggest you give it a try
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was amazing. The characters were so real I felt like I knew them, as if I grew up in the same dirty little town with all its insane secrets and harsh realities. The only thing I can say negatively is I knew who the killer was the whole time. I'm just not sure if that was on purpose or not. If it was, the idea was certainly clever. If you enjoy a distinct character voice and an original story line you'll love this book.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|There are some bad words in this ebook. it is a good book.I like it. I would rate this ebook 5.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|Excellant movie.<br />Beautiful Love Story.<br />I have recomended this movie and entire twilight saga to my friends and family.<br />I have no dislikes, about this movie
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Was disappointed in her choosing but saw it coming.  It was a bit draggy in parts but then I sat and read three books all very fast.  Maybe I just expected too much.  Do believe this is a case of reading the books first  and then seeing what &#34;Hollywood&#34; does with the story was the best way to get the most out of the story.
B008B92U32|3.0|It does what it says it will. My kids liked the extras. It is kinda cute. Definitely worth the download even if you only use a few times.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I don't subscribe to paid cable so that's why I bought the whole 1st year series.  The only way to go.  I was so on top of what was happening.  Will purchase the 2nd year when the prices come down.  Everything about it was outstanding.  Not sure where it will go from here but I'll find out soon enough.<br />I have recommended this to everyone I know, just as it was recommended to me.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|Nice game with fluid motion and controls. Even though I got this as a faotd (free app of the day) I would definitely pay $0.99 for this app.
B003O86FMW|4.0|So much went on in this second book, hope the upcoming movie will provide the visuals that one needs to fully appreciate what's going on.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I absolutely love this app it warns u when your getting low on battery. It will show you how long it took to get it to 100%. It has a lot more advantages to it but those are my main ones. I recommend this app for everyone. It's free and who doesn't  like to know how much battery you have left?
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Such a great read for military personal or people thinking of joining the military. Don't pass judgement, just read and reflect afterwards. Says the truth even at his expense. Great read!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story line was supberb.  The suspense was always there and kept you 'in the book'.  It was hard for me to put down.....thus a very fast read.  Am looking forward to seeing the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is exciting and packed with adventure. I will purchase this game. I like the first Temple Run but this one is better.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|\\"Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning.\\" This is the conclusion that a young Viennese psychiatrist, Viktor E. Frankl, reached in the course of more than three years in a succession of four Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz. The book he wrote in the space of nine days in 1946, originally under another title, morphed over the years into the thin volume known around the world today as Man's Search for Meaning. It has sold more than 12 million copies and been translated into 24 languages, serving as a source of inspiration and solace for millions of people. Man's Search for Meaning is frequently cited as one of the most important books of the 20th Century.<br /><br />Frankl's almost matter-of-fact description of his years in concentration camps is profoundly moving, the more so because it's a fiercely personal document and makes no attempt to relate the familiar statistics now surrounding the topic or to place the Nazi phenomenon in historic perspective. Frankl writes simply about how he personally managed to remain hopeful in the face of staggering brutality, including the murder of his young wife at Bergen-Belsen and the death of numberless friends and colleagues. As Frankl relates, their deaths came not only at the hands of SS guards but also, at least equally, as the result of sadistic behavior by the \\"Capos,\\" prisoners themselves raised to positions of authority and privilege by the Nazis. The effect of reading this material is searing. Here, God is truly in the details.<br /><br />However, Frankl's story about life in the concentration camps is only one of several parts in Man's Search for Meaning. The edition I read included five pieces written over more than half a century by three different authors: a foreword by Rabbi Harold S. Kushner, an Afterword by William J. Winslade, and three articles by Frankl. The first of these three, \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp,\\" has received the most attention from non-professionals. The second, \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell,\\" is Frankl's brief summary of the principles and procedures of logotherapy, the \\"third school\\" of Viennese psychiatry that Frankl created -- an approach that's often termed \\"existential psychiatry.\\" (Somehow, Carl Jung seems to have gotten lost in the numbering system -- perhaps because he was Swiss, not Viennese.) Frankl also wrote a \\"Postscript 1984″ bearing the title, \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism.\\" And all this writing fits comfortably into a remarkably thin little volume.<br /><br />Intellectually, Frankl's abbreviated introduction to logotherapy for the layperson, was the most intriguing part of the book. The term itself is derived from the much-used Greek word, logos, which has been applied to all manner of pursuits in philosophy, rhetoric, and religion. Frankl took it to mean something like \\"meaning.\\" He rejected the determinism of Freudian and Adlerian psychiatry, insisting that neither approach was useful in treating more than a minority of psychological problems. In his own practice and that of the students under his supervision in a series of top Viennese hospitals, Frankl found that many psychological problems could be easily cured by one or a few conversations between the patient and the logotherapist. Logotherapy involved no years-long sojourns on the analyst's couch. (In fact, patients sat in chairs.) He cites many cases of ingrained phobic and compulsive behavior that he and his disciples cured by somehow convincing patients not to worry about their behavior. A lifelong stutterer, for example, was cured when he was persuaded to enter conversations unconcerned about stuttering -- and the cure was lasting. A fellow physician transcended his depression over the loss of his wife in a single, short conversation with Frankl. The essential truth of logotherapy is as Frankl discovered in the camps: so long as we maintain a powerful commitment to some life goal outside our present circumstances, we can get through practically any privation.<br /><br />Man's Search for Meaning should be in everyone's library. The lessons Viktor Frankl teaches can be applied to challenges in any culture and all walks of life.ome life goal outside our present circumstances, we can get through practically any privation.<br /><br />Man's Search for Meaning should be in everyone's library.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|Morgenstern creates vivid images of a world one is not sure is fantasy. I read this for my book club and look forward to our discussion next week.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Recently discovered Kate Morton's books. Now reading the third of four. All excellent with great charater development and mystry.  I prefered the Secret Keeper a bit more than Riverton, but both well worth it.
B003TTKB5I|4.0|Watched this on my Kindle Fire, it looked and sounded great. First getting into this series and really liking it.
111846446X|5.0|This has been the best introductory book on the Raspberry Pi I have found.  It is well written and everything in this book is pertinent to the subject.  It really does serve as a user guide for the Raspberry Pi, covering all aspects of getting started with it, understanding what the device is capable of, and how to go about getting the most out of it.<br /><br />Being that the book was written by one of the creators of the Raspberry Pi, there are several places where the author provides an insight into why the device was designed the way it was.  It was interesting to get this perspective.  He also talked about some subtle aspects of the device that I hadn't seen anywhere else.<br /><br />The section on Linux covers how to handle some pretty specific issues, and while you might think there would be more time spent on  Linux in general being that it is so core to using the device, I can appreciate that what was chosen to be covered was specific to issues that a new RPi user might encounter, and wisely leaves a lot of general Linux information for other books.<br /><br />All-in-all I found the book to be a good read and it helped me to better understand the vision that the creators of the device had for it.  And unlike many other books on various technical subjects, the &#34;User Guide&#34; moniker on the cover of this one is used accurately.
020530902X|5.0|I love this book and I love this edition. Excellent quality and a great price and very fast shipping. Highly recommended.
B002NTGKSM|5.0|We loved this movie but it's not for young children. I'd say 12 and up is the earliest. The story was fantastic and the visuals were beautiful! I loved this one.
B00683JK9K|1.0|An interesting game, but often the last piece is simply missing.  I keep checking under the puzzle and in the side bar that holds the puzzle pieces, but the last one simply isn't there.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is a side of Jack that has never been shown before.  I really enjoyed this change.  Glad to see options.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I bought this for my daughter but I love the music too and we both have it on our iPods now.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|A well written story line. A modern day odd couple of two brothers that are opposites but share a common bond when it comes to eliminating the world's evil. This is an engaging and worthwhile show. I seldom watch television anymore as most of it is poorly written and rides on what ever the latest craze happens to be. This show has stayed very fresh and engaging for 8 years. My congratulations to the cast and their writers.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book kept me interested & involved - hard to put down at times. Some of the editing was remiss but overall I enjoyed the book.
B001R0LOES|5.0|Here is the story of the most important man in Ireland's modern history. The &#34;Big Fellow&#34; as Michael Collins is referred too is the reason Ireland has their own parlament today and not under England's thumb. Liam Neeson does a outstanding job in his portrayal of this great man. The story line accurately portrays the difficult politics and the internal struggle that much still continues today. If you are Irish this is a must see.  If you are not then this will still be worth your while to watch as it is packed with action and a love story that will have you cheering one moment and close to tears the next.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I'm a long time fan of Connelly's works. This is one of his better efforts.  I am going to ber curious how he handles Bosh's increasing age going forward. (A few more years and he will be the only 80+ year old dectective onthe force.)
1607066017|4.0|Awesome Sci-fi that's very grown up.  The premise:  Romeo and Juliet in space, except they've lived long enough to give birth to a kid.  I love the art!  Staples is great.  Vaughan is top notch;  yes, i would admit that there isn't much that's full on \\"new\\" here but the mix and match is interesting and compelling.  I want to keep reading!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I've read most of DeMille's works and this was a bit if a let down. Too much of the text was devoted to those &#34;cute&#34; asides from the main character.  In small doses, they work well, but DeMille is using them more and more...possibly to cover up a decreasing ability to develop new plots.
B009DQQE16|5.0|You will still love her. Great album that shows her heart and talent is still young. It deserved a price in France
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I just love this app!!  Great puzzles requiring planning and logic.  Great exercise for your brain and imagination.  Would highly recommend this app.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|A must read for the young and a very helpful read for every parent. A great refreshed of the Science you knew and a great introduction of the Science you didn't know. Great support to answer the many questions of the curious little ones at home. Great way to help everybody to understand the beauty of Nature, the fun of Science, the value of traditions and the emptiness of the non-rational beliefs of religion.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The plot is secondary to the interactions of the downstairs and upstairs groups.  Such totally different lifestyles but there is amazing amount of empathy between the two.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I found it hard to put this book down.  As Harry Bosch goes painstakingly through all the clues he finds.  He searches for people who served in Desert Storm for help.  Just when he thinks he has found a lead, a person is killed that seems like a key to solving the murder.  He also receives opposition from his supervisor who puts roadblock up against him.<br />It was excellently written and I enjoyed it very much!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Me llama mucho la atención lo que hay después de la muerte. Este libro me atrajo porque fue la experiencia de un médico neurocirujano y escéptico, así que me da claridad y esperanza en cuanto a la vida después de la muerte.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Went down hill from there. I was very taken with the characters at the start. It went way off course mid stream.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watch a fair amount of streaming HD content between Netflix and Amazon, and this was very good quality. Especially important for a show with such high production values. However, the audio had issues with clipping and popping sounds. It did not seem to be in surround, more like stereo plus center channel. One episode actually came through very well for sound but rest did not. Unsure what the difference might have been. I have 10mbps+ cable internet service, usually well over. Overall, it was still a great way to see the rest of the series before it aired locally.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A visionary. I went straight to the Apple store after reading the book. I suggested it for a new book club I started and we will be discussing it this week.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|reallt stupid gam waste of time can not came up with twenty five words to say how stupid it was
B006HL9G10|5.0|I love this meditation timer. The gentle, beautiful bowl tone is a perfect way to move out of a meditation session.  There are several different tones to choose from.  You're sure to find at least one you resonate with.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read...and I've read hundreds if not thousands over the years. It's a must read for everyone.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|At least season 1 had some &#34;charm&#34;.  I love scary shows and films, but this one's just way too creepy and gory.  I still watch it, and I will finish the season, but I will probably skip the episode Coat Hanger because I'm pregnant and the title alone makes me queasy.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Do you need to look at a review for a movie that has been out this long? Just watch it.
B008IZYWXU|5.0|This is a recording project that was a long-time coming and is warmly-welcomed now. The interviews released over the last several years with Ms. Caballe give clear indication of the deep friendship that she and Freddie shared. This connection comes across in the music. Some of the singing on this album is among Freddie's most beautiful--especially in his lower register. The orchestral arrangements and playing are top-notch, and beautifully recorded. A \\"must\\" for any Queen fan.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I really like the very complex harmonies on some of the songs.  The first song, &#34;Somenights Intro&#34; has a definite sound of Queen to it.  Very easy to get hooked on the tunes!
0765325950|4.0|Having read the previuous 13 books of this series, I was anxiously awaiting the grand finale.  In the main, I wasn't disappointed; I just wasn't thrilled.  Yes, Mr. Sanderson tried to tie as many loose ends togethers as possible.  But I actually found that enjoyable.  Since it was the &#34;last battle&#34; at least for this age, you expected some favorite characters to die.<br /><br />In the end, good and evil had to coexist, and that is actually good.  As previously mentioned, it would have been nice to have 50 pages less of the battle, and 50 pages more of an ending.  But on the whole, true fans have to read the end of this truly amazing adventure.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Classic and beautifully written. Superb acting, glorious period costumes, riveting story and so much more! I anxiously await the next season!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Our family could not wait until every Sunday night to see the next Downton Abbey!  What an spellbound show and with no commercials! We were so into the people both upstairs and downstairs, that we felt personally involved in each one. I will not give anything away, but the last season finale was something we were not ready for!!  What a devastating end!!!! We were not happy with the writer that time!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love hidden object games and this one does not disappoint.  It is easy without being too easy and a great way to pass the time on my lunch hour. or just to relax.  Great game.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|John J. Palmer guides the reader through their first extract kit homebrew before delving into the more advanced topics such as all-grain brewing. John touches on the underlying theory and science behind brewing without going into so much detail that the first time brewer feels overwhelmed with information. How to Brew is truly a great read for any level brewer.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This is a fascinating look into a possible history of the missing Anasazi Indians and the 14th tribe of Israel. I really enjoyed the suspense of this book and appreciated how well written and edited it was. If you enjoy conspiracies and wonder about the history of the United States Indian tribes then I think you would enjoy this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm hooked on this soap opera. Just watched the season finale last night and now will go thru withdrawal until next year!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My mom asked me to watch this show, and I hesitated...then a couple of my nursing friends told me how interested they were to the show, so I gave it a try. I was hooked from episode one!!! There are so many facets to the story you have to keep watching. The characters have sooo many layers as well, you never know what you're gonna get with them! This show is liked by men and women, and I hope will be around for a long while. PBS making a comeback???
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but the ending was a bit of a letdown. I stayed annoyed at Amy the entire time and although that's good character building, I wanted to strangle her myself. It took a bit to get used to the way the story was told, but once I got into it, I didn't want to put it down! Good read overall.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I really love this game.  I like to switch between this and the color version.  great game play, nice simple graphics but you dont need anything more with this game.  i highly recommend it
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|The \\"Die Hard\\" series continues. It is safe to say, while all of the \\"Die Hard\\" movies have been good, none of them held a candle to the original. The series has lasted five films on the strength of what was probably the best or one of the best action movies of all time. \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" won't be changing that. Not even close. \\"Die Hard\\" had too many elements that have been forgotten in its following films. The most important being that John McClane didn't defeat the large number of terrorists by acting like the Terminator. He did it by using his brain. He outsmarted them. He got into their heads and made them make mistakes. He did dangerous things, but they were all feasible, or at least somewhat humanly possible.<br /><br />\\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" brings back a little bit of that human element as McClane learns that his son, Jack (Jai Courtney) is in some sort of trouble in Russia. They are estranged, but John is determined to stand beside him in his time of need or try to patch things up. His son isn't so happy to see him and once they are together, John is hurdled into his son's life and situation like you would expect, with guns blazing and cars crashing.<br /><br />At the end of \\"Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard\\", John McClane faces off against a F-35 that basically annihilates a highway intersection and then somehow he ends up on the wing of the plane, balancing, surviving like Spiderman and in that moment, the series died to me. The series had lowered itself to the worst common denominator of action films in the 21st century. Thankfully, \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" redeemed itself on that level; somewhat. There is at least nothing THAT silly. Sure, there were some crazy things, even a pretty unrealistic and poorly staged scene where McClane drives over cars in a traffic jam, but nothing as bad as the F-35.<br /><br />The action scenes are good in this movie. Yet, after watching something like \\"Skyfall\\" from earlier this year, \\"Die Hard\\" sort looks dated and like yesterday's action movie. The story is pretty simple; of course so were the stories in all the other movies. You don't want to confuse the audience when all they want is carnage. Unfortunately though, in my humble opinion, carnage is overrated if you don't feel invested.<br /><br />\\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" did a lot of things right or at least turned the corner in the right direction, but it still is just an average action movie in today's new standard. There will always be a box office for action movies and I don't blame people for going to see this or buy it. Although, the real test of a great action movie is whether or not it will be talked and reviewed about 5 or 10 years from now, like \\"Die Hard\\", \\"Lethal Weapon 1 & 2\\", \\"Aliens\\", \\"Skyfall\\", \\"True Lies\\", \\"48 Hours\\" or \\"Terminator 1&2\\". \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\"...  won't.<br /><br />There just wasn't enough in \\"Good Day to Die Hard\\" to make your heart race and feel invested as if your own life depended upon McClane succeeding like in \\"Die Hard\\". Unfortunately the makers of the \\"Die Hard\\" movies forgot that the success of the series was more attributed to the line, \\"Tell her that she's the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me. She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, she never heard me say I'm sorry.\\" Rather than the relentless and \\"Expendables\\" type action sequences.ed and like yesterday's action movie.

B008EL4YX6|4.0|As the title says its just a one button beauty.  Comes with great game play for one button and great challenge for one button.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This has got to be one of the best James Rollins books ever. Novel after novel James blows my mind with his ideas. I would recommend anyone to read just one of his books. By the way this should be a movie...
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|This was just silly little missions.  Fly from the bed to the dresser.  I was expecting more of an action, mission oriented game.  Fly and get bad guys, or fly and rescue this or that, not shoot the coke can and land.  The graphics were great, the controls were a bit of a challenge, but not a deal breaker.
B00BESNKB8|2.0|It appears that have been a good concept in theory but just poorly executed. The story line was OK and the best acting was done by Russel Crowe but thats really not a surprise. It was cool to see Lucy Liu in a movie and her acting was pretty good as well. Overall the movie just falls short of having good fight scenes and better development of character. Its entertaining and only worth watching as a rental so I am glad I did not see it in the theater.
B007TMON8M|3.0|This game has good game play and very good graphics.  Like the title simple, it is, but also brings a challenge.  great physics game
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is the First time Daniel Craig has become a true 007!  His first 2 were ok, but not Really 007-isk.  He does a terrific job in this movie.  And I must say, so does every other actor.  I DO resent Moneypenny being a black person.  She has always been white.  Just like Agent Felix Lighter was first played by David Hedison, THEN a black man, and finally another black man in Casino Royale.  I believe they should STAY the race they are first introduced.  White stays white, black stays black, Chinese stays Chinese, Russian stays Russian, etc., etc.  It is too confusing the other way.  And STUPID.  Warps the integrity of the movie.  Also, I do NOT appreciate recording artists placing 4 or 5 Previews on a NEW DISC.  I WANT ONLY THE MOVIE.  Not the Advertising.  If I want a movie, I'll buy it.  I resent this crap being placed on new OR old  movies.  It is bad enough with costs as they are.  Recorders and re-recorders should wake up.  The public does NOT appreciate this!  But this IS a true 007 movie with a Twist at the end that was SO COMPLETELY SURPRISING.  I don't know whether to be devastated or await the future.  Guess I will see what is next.<br />Cecy Ivie
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I really like this game.  It is a great game with lots of challenges.  I like the graphics a lot and the game play is great.  It is smooth and plays well
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is very well written and connects you with every person's feelings. I would recommend that you read this book and enjoy the beauty it certainly has.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I really like this type of game.  The graphics, controls and game play were great.  I ended up stuck on one level and I mean stuck.  Could not pass it to save my life.  I still highly recommend it, will be attempting that level again in the future.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its really fun!!! A must get!!!! Take care of a horse and compete for money!!!! I have to admit I'm a little old for this game but its addicting!!!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is great and very addictive.  Some might say like sudoku, but different.  I love all the different difficulties.  Being played on a phone adds to it.  I do wish though that the random puzzles after completion would keep the picture, kind of like a track of all that has been completed
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|I loved it. I'd have appreciated it more if he'd removed filler content – maybe in a re-issue ;-)  Thanks Carmine!
B007TML4EI|4.0|this was a good game with great graphics and fun game play.  it was somewhat unique, but still was fun to play and did bring a good challenge
B0061S073A|5.0|My 7 year old brother bought about 20 dollars worth of apps, this helped me to limit what he could buy / buy at all.
B008458O3S|4.0|This game ramps the mine bending challenges at just the right pace.  It starts out very easy, but is great to learn on and goes up from there.  Just have to look for a minute, think for a minute, and act on it.
1423113462|5.0|GREAT BOOK, GREAT WRITER!  My daughter loves this Percy Jackson series, and this is the book she is up to.  A great buy at the right time.
B008K93302|5.0|I downloaded this app as insurance. My tablet is an Acer A500. I aquired the FLV Player prior to the A8. I use both consistantly and am very happy to have them. I also am very happy to have access to apps via Amazon.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I have never read a graphic novel and purchased this one because  I enjoy the tv series a great deal. This was worth the money and I will be purchasing the next in the series. Highly recommended.
1933492953|5.0|This is my second time purchasing this amazing book. I left the first one in storage back in NYC and now that I'm living in Japan I needed to brush up my skills and this book is like my bible. If I have to buy it a 3rd time I definitely will.
0452289963|5.0|Wonderfully well written and insightful book about one's self discovery and the power within. Offers an explanantion ot the meaning of life even tho I wasn't even looking, it was very interesting and uplifting.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Good story, unusual, quirky and interesting characters, held my interest. The backstory of author, Steig Larson's life, his death and the the dispute by his heirs, is a classic irony of Sheakesperian dimension.
0439813786|5.0|By one of my favorite children's book authors and illustrators, Brian Selznick. Interesting story and beautifully illustrated for children of all ages. A classic!
B006M4RN3U|3.0|Gift for my Sister-in-Law. I personally only enjoy one of their songs, but she asked for it for Christmas. So I am assuming she likes it.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This was a well made, informative, enjoyable documentary, made by someone who truly cares about the topic.  I highly recommend it!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly was a series that was definitely ended way before it deserved to be ended. As in all great shows, the strongest part was the characters. Every character was very well developed, and I would have gladly followed the series to see their backstories unfold. Watching the characters interact with each other and the amount of nuance they displayed in different situations was incredible, It's a tribute to the outstanding quality of writing, directing, and acting that was put forth in this series.<br /><br />Another aspect I find very interesting is the vision of the human race 500 years in the future as imagined by the writers. It seems to take a more realistic approach than other sci-fi stories. There aren't alien creatures and technology has evolved at the rate that seems believable, if you consider the history of technology and the rate it has progressed.<br /><br />It's too bad. Fox gave up on a series that had the potential to be as big as the Star Trek franchise.<br /><br />I always recommend this series to my friends, whether they are fans of science fiction or not.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|... and an excellent supporting cast too. A good character study plot. You keep rooting for the main character even though he is a mess! :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|By the time you finish the 1st 4 chapters you can not put this one down!  I kept wanting to sneak a peak at the ending but don't do it---that would ruin a wonderful read!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I bought the 2nd Jack Reacher novel Die Trying the same day I'm done reading Killing Floor...this statement said a lot.<br /><br />Killing Floor is well written, fast moving plot and most importantly Jack Reacher is a refreshing character, a retired MP! Not your usual special forces or CIA guy, too many of those.<br /><br />I'll recommend this to anyone who likes fast moving action thriller.
B0000669JL|5.0|Put the Top down and crank up the CD player - Love to take a ride in the country and just Jam
B00846REIS|2.0|one of the worst written books i have ever read....the story line made no since....I could not connection to the characters at all. i only read half the book, gave up waiting for the story to get better and or make since. I dont know how anyone could compare this book to E.L. james trilogy at least her books had a story line you could understand and a connection to the characters....would not waste my money!!!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I had heard a little something about it and thought that I would have a read of it.However,it was not my cup of tea,an age gap thing.I felt that it was well written and  unusualiy set out. It is really designed for a younger reader.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite books. I am not much of a reader and I couldn't put it down. I love his books. Definitely worth reading.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is the 3rd installment to a great series.  Quality is superb for both sound and video. What I liked about this movie is that it was a different direction then the prior movies and made for keeping you on the edge of your seat. The only thing I don't like about this series is Christian Bale's Batman voice. Other then that, you should own all 3 of these Blu-Ray movies.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|enjoyed this book.  It was a fast read. Being an Indian raised in america could related to being back with family and being so welcomed.  loved how the author times the book from asha's childhood to adulthood parallels with her birth mother kavita
B000FBFMIO|5.0|Got what I expected from her previous books and hooked once again with the characters, pace and plot.  Love it
B007SGM084|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from this to tell you the truth.  I had heard about it and I actually read and write fanfiction myself.  This story was well written and I loved the underlying emotion that went into Christian other than someone who was into the stuff he was into.  I would recommend this to others.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My daughter loves this game and would play on it all day if I let her.  She said she loves the part where you get to brush their teeth.
B005XN31LY|5.0|If you love supernatural shows, I would totally check out this show.  I love the twist on all of our favorite characters.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Watching the whole season off my PS3 on my big screen. Thanks amazon prime.  The app on my PS3 allows me to do this.
B001NLKS16|4.0|For anyone who loves this show and the boys, I would check this out.  It was interesting to read about John's thoughts on everything, from 'yellow eyes' to Sam's 'gift&#34;.
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|was dreadful from the begining never laughed once. wouldnt recomend this movie to any one. tim burton has made some good movies this isnt one of them!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wow, doesn't even begin to describe this book! Stephen King has outdone himself once again! A nice mix of true history and time travel fantasy!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Nothing about this app is anything I need but it's cool. I love looking at the stats. Fun and free!
B001P3SA94|5.0|This was a great product I really enjoyed it. The price was affordable. Thank you very much. Will purchase again
0575117931|5.0|I did not expect this to be better than the first book, but the second book is a page turning delight.
B008Q08QXE|5.0|I consider this one of the best films ever made, and certainly the best courtroom drama. Jimmy Stewart brilliant as the seasoned small town layer who spends most days fishing and most evenings playing jazz piano until he lands a high profile murder case defending a GI [Ben Gazzara] after being contacted by his fetching and flirtatious wife [Lee Remick], who reported being raped by the murdered man. This film is down-home but still urbane, gritty but still warm - and full of interesting and believable character.<br /><br />The story, the acting, the cinematography and pacing make this 2 and 1/2 hour film fly by.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|The vast majority of my games come from steam on my pc, and I do a lot of socializing over their friends network.  It's nice to be able to take my kindle wherever I want in the apartment and be able to chat with my friends.  Very helpful little app... and it's free, can't go wrong.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It just keeps getting better and better.  Is there any wonder why this great show has such a massive fan base?
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I started with the free version then upgraded to the full version. It was so worth it. I like to use the sound of bells for my alarm in the morning. It wakes me up, but isn't so jarring like so many of the alarm sounds are.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought this for my 19 year old for Christmas and she loves it! Stimulating. The graphics and the music are exceptional.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Haven't played its self but he likes it.  He says the.monkeys are bigger than on previous ones, just wish u could continue where u messed up
B009IJJ712|5.0|Solid cast, great writing - all in all a very smart show that I genuinely look forward to watching each week!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|New author for me.  But it certainly is a spell-binding series of books.  Am excited to read the next o ne.
1451624468|5.0|This book was very descriptive but easy enough to understand for the typical non college educated science enthusiast like me.<br /><br />Definitely one the best books I've read
B00846F1YW|4.0|I love hidden pictures and puzzles.  I also love a good terrible pun now and,then.  I really like these games, (Mysteryville and Mysteryville 2) but they are way too short.  I finished them in just a few hours each.  At three bucks each, that's pretty steep.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I had heard good things about the series Revenge and decided to &#34;TV binge&#34; the series. I am glad I did and am now caught up and watching season 3.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  Full of deep love and mystery.  Fast read you just could not put it down.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Graet movie!  This true story shows the human side of a famous historical person at a iome when a nation faced a tremendous trial.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Different. Love the twist. Interesting perspective.  A little boring at first, but then you can't put it down. Good read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Hello i like the game but I've only gotten about 2 hats an  its common but ive gotten special items so you guy's should fix that
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Exactly what I wanted. Plays well with no glitches. Good basic Disney movie for the princess collection. Grands love it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|So addictive!  Love this game.  Takes too long to get another coin (30 seconds) so spend a lot of time waiting to get that next coin, but worth the wait.
0761169253|5.0|I love this book.  It's a fun insightful book into the crazy world of being a creative individual and trying to create something worth creating.  I found it to be inspirational.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|imaginative sci fi, short story, good mix of scripts, no heavy sad drama, hero wins at the end. Acting can be better. Movie set can be more futuristic and sleek.
B008Y78GYI|5.0|Beautiful romance with lots of laughs.  Who could resist? An essential classic.  Streisand let's us see what an amazing<br />entertainer Fanny Brice was--just amazing.
0307477479|5.0|got this book as part of my creative writing fiction class this semester.... but really luving it...<br />it's absolutely compelling characters are keeping me up late reading...<br />highly recommend!
1451695195|5.0|I trust other doctors.. If you are older,  it is worthy to now something about other places you may occupy soon
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love it I wish I could afford the paying half tho! I cant afford it because of all of our debt. it really sucks ya know?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use. easy to see. lets you know where you were in your calculations.simple for easy problems that most people need to figure
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love that I can choose what I want to do when I want to do it and do not have to wait for the app. it is already there
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|As the movie progresses more pixels are apparent giving the picture an abstract quality. Even glasses can't clear this mess up
B008JGSM6G|5.0|just when you think that you have it mastered you don't! Then when you finally get it wow you think what!!!!
B005H0YP7W|5.0|arrived fast. love the cd, it is exactly what i was awating for. def recommended and would suggest to anyone!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I do like the conveniance of the face book. I just wish the games were easier to get on. Nice though
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is truly one of the best shows on TV in many years.  Everyone we know loves it.  However, it did seem that the third season wasn't quite on the level of the first two.
B0063GORYU|4.0|wish that I could make it bigger though makes you think about your next move! fun fun fun fun fun
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I wouldn't have thought that I would have any interest in a period drama, but many of our friends were singing it's praises and so we checked it out.  It truly is one of the best shows on TV.  We have since gotten most of our friends and family into the show and we don't know a single person who wasn't instantly hooked.  The second season is as good as or better than the first.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Life goes on after World War I and the big estates struggle to hold their lavish lifestyle.<br />Marvelous acting by the entire cast.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This game is nothing less than a brilliant concept.  It takes about 5 minutes to learn and about 20 minutes to play, but it never seems to get old.  As it is a game of chance and gamble more than a game of skill, it is always fun for everyone.  We play it with my 8-year-old and with other adults alike.  Even my 4-year-old likes to play it, but she just likes rolling the dice and needs help with the decision part of the game.
B004J4WLB4|1.0|I enjoyed the first part of the book and learning about the flowers and the characters.  But then it became tedious and I didn't have sympathy for the woman.  I finished the book because our book club was reading it but I can not honestly recommend it.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|This book was a big dissapointment.  There was no relationship development between Darcy and Elisabeth.  The author gives too many names to unnecessary characters and the plot is weak.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Good movie, perfect condition as posted. Very Happy. Arrived in the original case as promised and no defects at all.
B001AG52AG|4.0|After reading all three of the books on Lyra's adventures, I still enjoyed the film.<br />The casting and characters were well done, even in the limited plotline.<br />For those viewers with vivid imaginations the Golden compass will be a a pleasure.
B003M6OW4Y|3.0|Joss Wheddon, the creator of cult classics &#34;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#34; and the spinoff &#34;Angel&#34; tried again with &#34;Dollhouse&#34;. While it's an okay show, it doesn't live up to the lovable cheekiness or action in episodes of &#34;Buffy&#34; or &#34;Angel&#34;. Eliza Dushku is always a hit in whatever role she's in, but the show was a bit too much drama and not enough campy comedy for my tastes. The series felt rushed, with too much left unexplained or taken for granted, especially in the last episode of Season 1 and the ending of Season 2. The perks of the series are 1) seeing Ms. Dushku in a dominatrix outfit, and 2) the questions the series raises (but deals with somewhat awkwardly) of morality and the power of technology in the upcoming decades.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I own!! I recommend it for people who like to<br />build and create things<br />.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is a great series of shows. If you like Sherlock Holmes this one is for you. Many twists and turns in the episodes. I just wish there were more.
0553057006|5.0|Older book but wonderful for everyone to read. I teach in a low income school with lots of broken families. This book helps many of my students see it can be changed. Forgive but not forget is a very powerful lesson.
B005PK56TA|4.0|The ending was way to cute for my taste<br />However thats hust my opinion Five stars except for the last 1/2 hour of the season finale.
B00AHE2Q8I|5.0|I loved this Book.  Have recommended it to my friends who also loved it.  The characters are great, humorous and well written<br />One of the best books by Linda Howard and hope she writes more.
B0063GORYU|3.0|If you are going to compare this to the iphone or ipad app... you will be disappointed. It is a little slow and choppy. But it is still a fun game.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This show is well written and has just the right amount of science fiction and action! I love the characters and the story line. I highly recommend this show.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just don't miss this.  I am a huge Maggie Smith fan, but that isn't the only treat with Downton Abbey.
B009EEE2NO|5.0|Arnold's performance..outstanding !!  The Special effects used for the &#34;creature&#34; are amazing !!!  A must see and each time it's viewed you will discover more exciting details !!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great movie. A lot of action. Never can get tired of 007 flicks. Love Daniel Craig. I would recommend. This movie to anyone who is a James bond fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing this is the number one game I Lovelace it so much it is awesomely AWESOME
B007YLEMDE|4.0|I heard a few cuts from this album and decided to buy it. It has some great sessions on it but alot of it is very slow and bluesy. If you're looking for 'peppy' SRV songs, this album probably isn't it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Fast  paced  and smart plot liked Jack and the way you could read how his mind worked.  I felt the ending was realistic in terms of Jack and Roscoe .
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this type of game.  So much fun to move it all around.  Very colorful and exciting.  You will love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers Rio is a great game are you<br /><br />going you make  game as awesome  as this game<br />this game is like temple run where you have to jump  over things in your way.<br /><br />.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|This is a very addicting game. I enjoy things that make you use your brain and anticipation skills. This is ther perfect game for that. Definately a must play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game. doesn't stop while you play like my other games and since I. love HORSES this game is the BEST-KNOWN GAME IN THEIR UNDERWEAR
B0091LS07E|5.0|This girl is just great. This album is amazing great music, great lyrics and the album box is also great
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game its so addicting its like temple run but better I recommended to everyone and its free what r u wastnong
0425263908|5.0|I got the book quickly, in the condition listed.  It is a pretty good read, and I highly suggest readers go back for the sequel!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This book held my interest but had some dry spots.  I'd read it again tho.  I am a real Reacher fan!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This series of books are entertaining and addictive. The writing is fantastic with a host of sympathetic characters and complex plots. My only complaint is that there are only five so far when there should be fifty.
B00710Z87M|5.0|I feel grateful for having read this book and am now more finely attuned to the basic tenants of manifesting abundance.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|it is the best game ever nothing kime it kove utkive kove koeve loev kove love love it t t t t ttt
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Takes you to quite unexpected places!<br />A little slow here and there, but I was so greatly intrigued, I couldn't lay it aside.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|If you are bored and looking for a nice and quick movie Rango is the best choice . . .
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I thought I would listen to her for a change.  I'm glad I did. Her music is different, kind of ethereal, bordering on classical. She's got a terrific voice and her lyrics are distinct. I think I am a fan. I will buy more of her stuff.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Towards the end I found that it was hard to put down.  It does have some parts that are hard to read.  I thought that the author did a good job of making sure that the reader knew what was going on but wasnt overly graphic..especially with the nature of what she was talking about.  I also really enjoyed how in the end all of the characters were tied together.  I know that books are supposed to do that, but it was amazing what she did
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|It wasn't exactly what I thought it was gonna be, but it was a very, very good movie. Denzel was absolutely incredible in it. He should be up for an Oscar.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|it was ok.  It defiently had its laugh out loud moments.  A few times my husband and I were in tears but towrds the end it took a more serious note and I felt took away from the comedy of the movie.  I did enjoy it though and would absoutly watch the beginning again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The only thing I really did not like was the ending. Overall, it was a fun read. Worth the time and money.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I enjoyed the first and second book but the 3rd and 4th started to drag me to sleep. Martin likes to talk a lot =)
B009DH2PP4|5.0|Every homebrewer should read this book. It's THE textbook for beginners, but veterans can learn a lot of the chemistry behind the brewing process. A must read.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Hi-tech but barbaric story. Collins is a good technical writer though.  But the movie adaption is good and exciting.  Cant wait for the next book in the cinema.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|While I'm a NY-er, I know many people from the Boston area and I don't even think the roughest of RedSox fans use the &#34;F-Bomb&#34; as many times as the people in this movie!  People from the Boston area should be insulted by their portrayal in this movie!<br />With that said, to paraphrase Ted, &#34;This &#34;F-ing&#34; movie was &#34;F-ing&#34; funny and an &#34;F-ing&#34; good &#34;F-ing&#34; time!&#34;
B003YL4LYI|3.0|It became dragging towards the end and lots of unfinished business Seems like GR Martin would still like to write a continuation, otherwise he keeps us all hanging..
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love all the Mahjong games.  This is as fun as all the others and it's very interesting to me.
B00BESM14U|3.0|It was not a very interesting movie.  Characters were similar to ones in other books.<br />A ninth grader would never be accepted by 12th graders, especially not liked by the girls.<br />It was rather far-fetched.<br />The movie did not explain who the main character was and what his issues were very well.<br />Viewer had to figure too much out themselves.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Action Packed.  Great special effects.  Very entertaining.  I would recommend this movie to my friends and anyone else.  It was ok for my 12 yr old to see.  I appreciated that.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|I love this show cause it's spookie and has so many twist and stuff great actors I cant get a enough of this show
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Too awesome. I'm addicted to this game. Really cool time waste I recommend to anybody. My sisters and friends love playing too
B0007939NO|5.0|I love movies that require imagination as well as reality. It's fun to pretend something like this could really happen.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|If you have seen the movie that this beautiful soundtrack belongs to, then you have probably fallen in love with everything, Les Miserables. This soundtrack, features all the right songs. I just really hope they release another with more!
B004VQRCF0|4.0|Um dos melhores shows desta banda que marcou a história do rock progressivo, muito bom mesmo, quem gosta desse tipo de música está muito bem acompanhado quando comprar
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book came to my attention because of the movie, in particular, the Oscar nominations. Never being able to find a sitter, I thought I'd try the book instead of the movie, and wow! I find it a delightful read. I found tremendous humour and warmth in this journey to better mental health. I especially loved the Mom, a wonderfully inspiring character who held it all together.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this novel in one sitting. It was beautiful, heart wrenching, raw, insightful, funny, and thought-provoking-sometimes all at once. I just sat and cried at the end for so many reasons. This book deserves ten stars.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have a hard time reading what I like to call \\"of the hour books\\". They are the ones everyone is reading at the moment.  However, I relented and bought it.  It pulled me in almost immediately and kept my attention throughout the entire story. The imagination and creativity that went into the story is undeniably remarkable.  I have already recommended it to many of my friends. Take a chance, it's worth it!
B006CR2PD0|4.0|The review of the blu ray is one topic the review of the movie another one. The blu-ray initially seemed to indicate sharper pictures but only at the start.<br />The movie can be seen either as erotic as well as moralist. Erotic by the combination of a good match of a couple together with actions that increased adrenaline in characters depicted as well as in viewers of the movie with well selected music for the action.<br />Moralistic in the sense that at the final the major feminine role ( Kim Bassinger) painfully renounces all those attractive aspects of a life full adventure, pleasure and money in favor of one much similar to the one of the painter that she has brought to a display in her gallery.<br />When I get hungry, I eat when I get thirsty, I drink... is one key aspect of the dialogue the painter has with her before the display of his work at her gallery of art. The world of fashion is marked by famous characters as one of the Rolling Stones ( Woods , I think)
B00APJLX8E|4.0|Full of laughs for the whole family! I took my Grandchildren to see this movie when it was in the theaters.<br />15 minutes into the movie my 9 year old Granddaughter leaned over and whispered<br />To me &#34;Poppy, can you buy this when it comes out on DVD?&#34;<br />I did of course and we've watched it together several times.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I love this movie and was getting it for a last minute gift. I should have ordered sooner, however they still got it to me just in time for what I needed. It's perfect.
B000FCK65W|5.0|A great story that was a glimpse into life in the early 20th century. What an impact immigrants had on America!
B006TLFPKO|1.0|I started watching the movie on my computer and after about 30 minutes, it cut off.  I could never watch the entire movie.  Please don't waste your money on this product.  I'll never buy another on-line movie!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have been told for years to read this book, but didn't until just recently. It really inspired me to think of others and their primary language...whether it be with my husband, family, or dear friends. We are all different. After I figured out my husband's love language, I started applying some of the idea's the author gave, and my husband has been a much happier man...thus, giving me what I need as well. I highly recommend this book to those who may be struggling in their relationships or those who are not.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game and it's AMAZING on my kindle fire I just wish the updates were a little quicker
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I must say I'm hugely impressed. It's been quite a while since any book tied me up to the e-reader (in that particular case) the way epic adventures of Alexander Dumas used to do when I was a teenager.<br /><br />Brilliant pace, causing a constant &#34;only one more chapter&#34; syndrome, interesting characters and mysteries that we desperately need to unravel, it all create an incredibly fast page-turner.<br /><br />It's also very interesting how the author deceives us as for who the main protagonist of the book really is, at least at the beginning.<br /><br />Silo Saga stole the last few days of my life to my deep satisfaction, but I'm not going to give up on it just yet, it's just time to buy Shaft - next installment of the series.<br /><br />Which I advice you guys to do in advance, you'll be doing it anyway, if you start reading Wool, so why wait?
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|This book was good bit kids want more I chose this rating the book was excellent loved it absolute but it needs to be longer I finished it in 3days

B005HSL626|5.0|I really think this is a great time killer and a game that I have enjoyed playing. Tks Halfbrick!!!! I can't wait to find more of your games.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Amazing I would reccomend this to any one it is fun to make art get pictures or even draw on pictures from the Internet. thank u people who made this get this game its amazing.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love being able to get the weather report so quickly on my Kindle.<br />Plus has info on extended forcasts and severe weather.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This was a very uplifting encouraging movie. It makes you realize that you can do anything in this world you put your mind never give up and shoot for the stars
B0064X7FVE|1.0|truly insults the intelligence of all users; replaces three day forecast with giant picture ads. even the new widget is hideous and useless.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I'm a grown-ass woman. There's no reason I should like (and worse! relate to) Taylor Swift's songs.<br /><br />But I do. So help me, I do....
B007HGPBRC|3.0|He's always been a very eloquent writer but the subject of his cancer isn't what I was expecting. At all
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Can't wait for sequel.... Actually just finished reading this for the second time in anticipation for the upcoming release of sequel.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Lot of fun watching this series as a family. We bought it for Christmas and couldn't stop watching till it was 2 in the morning! Very good series!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This was a good story line it expands on the trilogy and keeps open the possibility<br />of more films.great action!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started reading the Hunger Games trilogy when my 87 year old mother recommended the books to me. I thought the first book was good. This book is better! I don't want to reveal plots and I'm not a professional reviewer anyway. All I can say is, I work 2 jobs and have little spare time and I read this book in about a week because it held my interest and the plot keeps moving. There are a few surprises in here and I won't spoil those for you. I'm reading the third book now and I like it, too.  If you liked the Hunger Games, you'll love Catching Fire. Rock on, Katniss!
B001BC5HXG|5.0|This has been a classic I have missed over the years. Thankfully I have the maturity to grasp the issues of the &#34;bad seed&#34; , &#34;duality of man&#34; and &#34;thou mayest&#34; for the learned evil and or sins of man. This is truely a fascinating novel with issues that still plaque us. How the heck did Steinbeck put this together?
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The wonderful writing, acting and gorgeous scenery and custumes makes this series the monumental hit that it has become.  Fairly historically accurate and full of twists and turns.  Nice to see the differences between the classes portrayed without an anti-upper class dislike.
0143118757|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. it has lots of insight and practical examples ready to implement. It would suit anyone but the most value is for people who want to sharpen their skills.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I didn't even finish the first chapter.  Not something I was willing to spend the afternoon reading. I deleted it from my Kindle.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This film shows what happens in the food industry, especially with the meat products.  There were parts of the film difficult to watch because of the manner in which the animals are kept.  And it makes it very worrisome when I purchase a pound of ground meat at the grocery.  It has given me insight into which producers are more humane and may provide a safer product.  I, personally don't eat meat but my family does.  Fortunately, I have the income to make a choice to buy a better product but a lot of consumers do not have that choice.  Just shows that corporations, whether the food industry, energy industry, financial industry, or pharmaceutical industry control many of our choices.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I just finished this book in four days!!! It was sooo good! I felt like I was this young  girl going through it all! I just wanted to keep reading and reading... I loved it :)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am enjoying this series. Great stories and characters.<br />But, I love British drama and this one is very enjoyable.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love the Scarpetta series! The characters and histories are well developed and complex keeping your attention from beginning to end. Conflict and intrigue are woven throughout the book both in the personal lives of the characters and within the murder being addressed. Can't wait for the next installment!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|If you like puzzles, you will like this game.  Great for all ages.  It runs smoothly on the Kindle!  Fun!
0062127241|2.0|i was so disappointed by this book. one of the most important, exciting artists in rock music wrote one of rock's most boring book. it should be titled \\"I don't know Who I Am but i'm going to try to work it out in the next 500 pages.\\" i was SO looking forward to this book and was so disappointed. I put this book down to read Rod Stewart's book, which was fast and funny, open and refreshing.<br />Why O Why are the enormously talented SO troubled.<br /><br />Read Rod Stewart's book if you'd like a viewpoint on London and Rocking during this time period. Or pick up David Crosby's great autobiography, written about 15 years ago to learn about rock scene through California eyes.
B005HSL626|4.0|passed the time. It is better play on a 9 in vs a 7 in screen.  Also like the arcade version best.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Except fo r some of the violence it was really exciting and different.  I don't care for gross torture stuff.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|I got it installed and printed a test page.  It still will not print web media.  Could not find help.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Instead of shooting piggies, you free caged birds.  To unlock levels you have to get stars which gives incentive to go back and get 3 stars for each.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|enjoyed this Kindle book. The illustrations help clear up the visual the author is trying to convey. Worth the price ..
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Haven't finished it yet but was immediately sucked into the story and am enjoying every word of it.  When an author has created a great main character, he can't write a bad book.
B007WEQ3K8|2.0|I have found this to be very repetative and boring. My grandchildren find it to be exciting though, so I guess some good has come out of it.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|My grandchildren really enjoy playing this application, it has great graphics and is very intereactive.  I would recommend this application.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|first of all a nice colour! It's easy to find<br />Working well - functionality ok.<br />But -  a little more heavy than expected
B0088W7VNG|5.0|excellent sci fi. the show is well written and well directed and well acted although a bit of overacting. overall great
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I loved bingo blitz on facebook and love it even more on my kindle fire. Works and looks great!!  Must have for bingo lover's.
B004M5HKIY|3.0|Although this is a great buy it was a gift for an 8inspiration yr old and the fact that u could not go to certain book but had to read straight thru was frustrating to him.  There should atleast be a table of contents listing each book & letting you go to start of any u choose.  Would not recommend for a young reader.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|If you are an American history buff this is a must.  Gives a different perspective on the American Indian wars and the settlement of the west.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I think its a really fun movie.  If you like birds you will enjoy this funny colorful story.  It's a must see!!!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I wish it had a little more action I just expected more from watching the previews but overall it was a decent film.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is an awesome game. Story line couldn't be any better. A must have for gamers of any age young or old
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This story was captivating from the first page. It was well written and had wonderful characters. The level of scientific detail was well maintained throughout the book. The story was engrossing and had me feeling if I was right there on Mars. Well done sir, well done indeed.
0062012339|5.0|Amazon, you never cease to amaze me.  The book came very quickly....especially since it was right before Christmas, this made me very happy.  The book itself was in excellent condition.  Loved this book, it really depicted the life of the band and Tommy Lee and gave a great glimpse of what it was like.
B005GSY23M|5.0|Luv, luv, luv! When I first heard this soundtrack I just couldn't get enough.  So whenever I need a boost I tune in a groove out to it.  Highly recommend!
B0027MJU00|1.0|Very dark. I can't imagine the frame of mind that she was in for someone to write something as depressing as this.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Really enjoy the puzzles.  Lots of different subjects. They are addictive and challenging. I will definitely keep buying puzzle packs.
B00755646W|5.0|Truth Or Dare is one of those few rockumentaries that takes you into a fun filled world mixed with amazing 35MM filmed concert sequences that sparkle on Blu-Ray.  Madonna shocked the world with her 1990 Blond Ambition Tour and challenged people to face their fears and challenge their beliefs and this movie does the same.  You see a team full of love, support, and fun.  Everytime I finish watching this film I smile and wish that it lasted longer.<br /><br />As for this Blu-Ray release, it may not have special features.  But the transfer was amazing.  The gritty black-and-white is expected and the concert clips took my breath away.<br /><br />I would totally upgrade from the DVD version.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read a lot, especially fantasy/mystery/horror, and I think this was the fastest I've read a book in years. Once you get into the story, you won't want to put it down until it's finished. And then you'll want to buy the next two books in the series right away!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season is a bit dull in comparison to prior ones but it's still not over so I don't want to really judge it until the end.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Extremely helpful guide, if you're looking to e-publish for Kindle. I do wish there was a little more help for anyone not using Microsoft Office 2010, but as long as you have access to that program, this guide will tell you what you need to do.
