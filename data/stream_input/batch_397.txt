B00000JLWW|5.0|(...) Sometimes you have to takes movies as a whole, and this one is WONDERFUL! There is not one uninteresting character and the love story is heartbreaking, yet at the same time, is one of those that would make you thankful to experience it even for a short amount of time. To nitpick about nudity (that was not even a sex scene. It was artfully and tastefully done and was one of the most beautiful moments in the movie) and about profanity and taking \\"the Lord's name in vain\\" (that was and is the way people speak and would be unrealistic to portray it any differently) is to needlessly diminish the value of a truely superb movie. This movie is a classic. Any movie that can get people to go back over and over again derserves its props.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Lost in Translation is one of the best movies of 2003.  It's truly a masterpiece.  However, the DVD was done poorly.  You cannot skip through the previews at the beginning of the disc and there are no commentaries.  There's no excuse for not having at least one commentary track for a movie of this caliber.  <br />If you want to see this movie (and you should) then rent the DVD and wait for a director's release DVD with better quality extras. (or at least one that you can pop into the DVD player and watch without sitting through 15 minutes of advertising)

0156012197|5.0|I read this book as a child and didn't appreciate the wisdom it offered in a small boy and a difficult flower.  I stumbled upon it last year in a bookstore, and sitting on the floor in the children's section, I read with new eyes, finally recognizing the genius of Saint-Exupery.  His way of revealing beauty, comforting loneliness, and recognizing truth is utterly compelling.  This story is a model of what true friendship between two unlikely people can be. Discovery outweighs fear, beauty outweighs eventual sadness and loss - the risk is worth it<br />One phrase sums up the entire book, and, therefore, friendship and love. When situations get difficult, when people are lost, or sad, or may cause you pain, remember the fox who knew the value of a single person.  The color of wheat....
0739313126|5.0|Nowadays, a standard suspense/thriller novel will undoubtedly have approximately two main characters (of the opposite sex, of course) and the reader will be plunged into a tale of murder or deceit or something of the sort, and somewhere along the line, the two main characters of the opposite sex will fall in love.  Its the run of the mill storyline and it sells.  The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, however, takes some of the basic recurring elements of the suspense/thrillers and puts a lot of thought and complex plot weaving together to come up with something with a unique sound to it.  The book not only solves a murder mystery, but the mystery of the \\"Holy Grail.\\"  This goes far beyond anything many people would have imagined.  The complex use of symbols and double meanings within the plot itself is impressive.  To incorporate these elements into something tangible, such as Da Vinci's works, is an even higher level of amazing.  Whether the description of hte art in this book is accurate, and the book claims it is, does not matter.  What matters is that Brown managed to take something that coulda, mighta, maybe happened and made sense.  So what if Da Vinci's stuff was just a ficticious spring board for the plot? It is incredible that it could be seen as that at all.  This book is good and shouldn't be read analyzing it for truth- the prologue claims the descriptions of things are accurate.  Just read the book; the rest speaks for itself.
0385504209|5.0|I know, I know, this book came out over a year ago and I'm only now getting to reading it.  Let me just say, this is one of the most engrossing, exciting novels I've read in a long, long, long time!  It's not just the fact that it's a thriller -- some of the thriller aspects are little hard to believe -- it's all the history and speculation we get to be a part of.  From the very first page, the author draws you into secret sects, religous history, and ancient secrets involving Leonardo Da Vinci.  Everything from speculation about Mary Magdalene to the Divine Proportion, this book has something for everyone.  Christians, in particular Catholics, may find some of the speculation difficult to take, but as a practising Christian I was intrigued by everything.  I may not buy all of it, but it sure makes for great reading.  Don't be stupid like me -- get this book now!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I guess a lot of people can't appreciate this album. It seems a lot of people have to much time on their hands to moan and complain about this gem. Get over it ! It's just an album ! And so what if Paul Mccartney wanted to rerelease this record ? Now everyone of the Beatles is happy, John, George, and Ringo, like the original, and Paul, and Ringo like this version, and as well, George gave the album his blessing just before he passed away, and I would like to think that John Lennon would have been happy with this record if it had been released this way back in 1970, because of all the Beatles, John wanted the album to be completely LIVE, and this is what we have here, pretty much. I know, there are a few overdubs on tracks like &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, but John wasn't on that song anyway, and neither was Billy Preston, so the missing instruments are filled in nicely on this song. I have said all there needs to be said about the overall album in my other review, so I won't get into it all again. <br />This may not be the best album by the beatles, but it is a heck of a lot better than all the garbage that we have out there these days, like generic pop music, where everyone sounds the same. The Beatles were unique, no one else sounds like them, and no one ever will. <br />I know there is a lot of editing on this album, but the reason for this, i read, was to make the album sound as exciting and polished as possible, so really I don't that is such a bad thing, I mean, you can't release a poorly recorded album, can you ?<br />Anyway, I just thought I would add another 5 stars to the list, since I truly believe that this is still a good release. Anything released by The Beatles is welcome with me, especially in this day and age.<br />Long Live The Beatles !
0446677450|4.0|I liked the book a lot. I thought that it would be boring because it had to do with money and economics, and the fact that I had to read it for a class made it less appealing.  However, I found it a very fast read, and made money and economics, assets, liabilities, and all of that stuff sound very simple. I liked that Kiyosaki did not just talk about his theories on how to get and stay rich, but he did it in a way that was interesting to read.  It was an actual story that you were following, and it wasn't until later that you realized you actually learned something.  So overall, I liked &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad,&quot; and recommend it for people that are looiking to be financially stable.  I also think that people such as teenagers (like myself), should also read it so that they can get a start on their financial future, as Kiyosaki did.
B000005S0E|4.0|I'm sure that there are people who've given this album a good rating simply because it's a Cure album, and that isn't right.  This album deserves a good rating because it is damn-near impenetrable by casual (and even dedicated) fans.  A gutsy, drunken affair, the Top is exactly like it's cover art... strange.  But it's saving grace is the reward a listener gets from really paying attention.  The lyrics are downright absurd, spooky, sad, and angry.  Certainly not the best Cure album, but one that deserves recognition.  I group the Top in with Wild Mood Swings.  Both albums are very good, but you must listen to them with an open mind.  This is not a Cure record, really, but a Robert Smith record, made when he was quite inebriated, but still quite creative.  Shake dog shake, Wailing Wall, Top, and Piggy in the Mirror are brilliant.  A great overall album, even if it is eternally misunderstood.
0440237688|5.0|The main characters of this book are called \\"The Giver\\" and the \\"Receiver.\\"  Jonas is a 12-year old boy who was chosen by the community to be the next \\"Receiver.\\"  This isn't your average community, this community is runned by the Council.  They run it by advice that is given from The Giver. <br />The one thing I liked about this book was that Jonas got to work with The Giver.  I thought it was really cool that Jonas got to experience seeing colors, riding on sleds, snow, sunshine, sunburn and pain.  Things that he never even imagined.  That was one of my favorite chapters.  The Giver's job is to pass along memories, emotions, feelings of pain, joy and happiness onto Jonas.  Jonas' job is to receive them.   <br />One thing that I really didn't like was some of the Community rules.  They were only allowed 2 kids per family. I think that kind of sucks that you get your kids assigned to you and you can't just have your kids yourself.  They assign you 1 boy and 1 girl per family.  They believe that any more would ruin the community.  I feel sorry for most of the kids because they can't ride bikes until a certain age.  You can't really do anything until they, the community, feel you are mature enough to do it. Overall, it was a great book and very interesting to read.

1558908846|5.0|The career of a Hollywood Star goes through various ups and downs. This excellent film came out at a point in Stallone's career when it was simply his turn to get reviewed harshly by the Hollywood community. He was getting older, his career had drifted considerably, and another Sly action picture was simply going to be a very hard sell. It took a much-underserved whipping when it was released.<br />As I say, that is a real shame, because Judge Dredd was one of the best comic book adaptations to ever make the cross into film. It perfectly captures the 70's/80's British comic book about a futuristic cop who reins supreme, given the power to arrest, judge, and execute wrongdoers in a world gone rampant with crime.<br />This was a big budget production, and the sets and special effects are magnificent. The story is extremely engaging, and it is packed with great action. The film really doesn't take a misstep throughout.<br />What makes the film a real treat are the supporting performances. Stallone himself delivers a perfect-pitch job as the Judge, nicely capturing all the stern dedication of the comic book, and as the film progresses, his character is beautifully and even touchingly rounded out. But I find myself remembering the lesser roles, such as Armand Assante as the arch villain, Rico, a man holding extreme power in his madness. When his temper flairs, everyone jumps back. The old veteran, Max Von Sydow, displays a pro's commitment in his portrayal of the aging Chief Justice Fargo, holding on to his power simply through a towering dignity. Diane Lane, Jurgen Prochnow, and Joan Chen are on hand to lend superior support, as well as Rob Schneider, who did a great job in giving the movie the touch of comedy needed to truly capture the original comic book. This film even has the great Scott Wilson on board as Pa Angel, a leader of a criminally mutated family that dwells in the &quot;cursed earth.&quot;<br />Amazon reviews got it completely wrong. Their condescending review was typical of the kinder reviews given when the film was released. There is certainly no need to &quot;lower your expectations&quot; to enjoy this film.<br />You will do just fine if you come to this picture expecting great things.<br />--Mykal Bantang review was typical of the kinder reviews given when the film was released.

B00000K44W|4.0|This album, on the whole, is not top-grade Tull , but the title track &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; is one of the most beautiful songs ever written by the group. This poignant salute to the Clydesdale Horses and their diminishing role in modern labor pumps out great lyrics and music. <br />The song opens: &quot;Iron clad feather feet pounding the dust/on October's day, towards evening/Sweat embossed veins standing proud to the plough/Salt on a deep chest seasoning.&quot; I've always enjoyed the lyrics by Ian Anderson &amp; Co, but nothing they have done is as tangible, or as moving, as the prose in &quot;Heavy Horses.&quot;<br />Even if you are not a Jethro Tull fan, this album is worth your money and time. And it's rare that I would recommend a Tull album to non-Tull fans for just one song off that album. Seriously, the song really is that good.
B0001FR3IG|2.0|The first half of this movie builds with an interesting story concept and some beautiful and inventive cinematography. Then it simply runs away into a film so full of plot holes and forgotten story threads that it sort of dissolves into nothing.<br />By the end of the film, all the characters have lost any depth that was hinted at in the promising beginning. Robert Downey gets one decent scene, and then is left to wander through the rest of the picture, delivering a line here or there and generally looking either bewildered or dutifully concerned. Halle Berry, who has proven that she can act well in a supporting role, can't really seem to deliver the weight needed to carry a picture.<br />All in all, a good start that quickly digressed into a weak mishmash of ideas and concepts. All the viewer is left with in the end is the rainy, bleak atmosphere of the picture - slick and pointless. --Mykal Banta
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Robert T. Kiyosaki,<BR>Warner Books, 1997, 1998<br />Robert T. Kiyosaki: Born in Hawaii in 1954, Attended college in New York, also wrote Cashflow Quadrant: Rich Dad's Guide to Financial Freedom, Rich Dad's Guide to Investing: What the Rich Invest in, That the Poor and the Middle Class Do Not!, Rich Dad's Prophecy: Why the Biggest Stock Market Crash in History Is Still Coming... and How You Can Prepare Yourself and Profit from It!, Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich...Without Cutting Up Your Credit Cards, and Rich Dad's Retire Young, Retire Rich, served in Vietnam as an officer and gunship pilot.<br />Thesis: Mr. Kiyosaki is basically trying to stress \\"outside-the-box\\" thinking in terms of personal finance and business.  He emphasizes that fear and greed are the culprits in ruining the potential for one to become rich.  In order to successfully \\"make money work for you\\" instead of vice versa, you must think beyond the concepts of being paid for your work and follow your dreams to make a plan to manipulate a small amount of money into a large amount.<br />Summary: This book is split into 6 lessons which touch on different aspects of focusing your plans to manipulate your money flow.  One states that the \\"rich don't work for money.\\"  This concept speaks of the difference between assets and liabilities.  Kiyosaki says that the rich use assets because they build money instead of drain it like liabilities do.  The poor and middle class have liabilities.  Another is proper education in financial literacy.  You must understand the workings of business and money in order to properly manage and control it.  Kiyosaki also emphasizes the focus on your own management skills and cash flow to discipline yourself in spending money.  He recommends an understanding of taxes and the success of corporations (through marketing, cash management, etc.), as well.  He also stresses the importance of working to learn, not for money.  By learning from the ones you work with, you can expand your knowledge on the workings of money and adjust your method for income accordingly.<br />Analysis: I feel that Kiyosaki did a very good job in supporting his thesis.  He offers many ways to rearrange your way of thinking in terms of making money.  It could be called an \\"enlightening read,\\" as it raises you to another point of view that is much more clear and easy to control than the \\"ordinary\\" way people make money.  As for the message of the book, I agreed with Kiyosaki in his emphasis on elevating yourself out of the mindset of a worker into a position of much more control over your income.  However, it must be taken with a grain of salt, as his philosophies may be a little too much for a common working person to suddenly change to in the event that they want more of an income.  It may take too much self-discipline for some.<br />Reviews: \\"Robert Kiyosaki's refreshing writing style, down-to-earth examples, and simple illustrations provide a fascinating and informative alternative to the cookie-cutter books for financial planning that typically line the shelves of bookstores.\\" - [...]<br />\\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a starting point for anyone looking to gain control of their financial future.\\" - USA Today<br />\\"The book that `rocked' the financial world. J.P. Morgan declares `Rich Dad Poor Dad a must-read for Millionaires'.\\" - The Wall Street Journal

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of those rare series that has kept me awake until 3AM nightly viewing it.  Rarely in decades, have I seen such a warm, thoughtful and expertly cast series as that which Josh Whedon has assembled in Firefly. It is true, that once you have seen the first several segments, you're hooked. <br />The interviews that accompany the 4th DVD can easily lead someone to become wet-eyed, when it is learned that the network (who should not remain unnamed but will), tried in classic Hollywood fashion, to change something totally developed and functional into just another piece of viewing wasteland.  Fortunately, Whedon did not give in, but the loss of the series is a genuine tragedy.<br />The cast is incredible as an ensemble, and reflects the genuine care and friendship that they have for one another as disclosed in the accompanying interviews on the 4th DVD. It has a lot of the same feel as &quot;West Wing&quot; in this area. This DVD set is a prized addition to my film and television library.<br />There are few series that I would pay to see resurrected, but this is one of those.  It would be a perfect fit for the Sci-Fi Channel.  Mr. Whedon, are you listening?
B00005QCYC|4.0|With the first &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; ILM broke new ground in CGI special effects. They created dinosaurs that looked incredibly real, and at the time people really didn't know how it was done. I figured it had something to do with computers and the same technology that was used for The Abyss, Terminator 2, and one of the Sherlock Holmes movies back in the 80's (&quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; perhaps?), but still had no idea how it was done, and had never seen anything like it before. This was truly a unique experience. This film told many other film-makers, like George Lucas, Peter Jackson, etc., that anything that could be imagined could be made into a film, which is the reason why we now have the Star Wars Special Editions, the Star Wars Prequels, The Lord of the Rings, and countless other great sci-fi/fantasy films being made. For this reason, as well as the great thrill ride of a story that the first Jurassic Park gave us, this movie is among the greats.<br />&quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park,&quot; gave us an even better dino flick than the first one did, raising the bar in what could be done with CGI and animatronics as well as creating an even more fun story. And the story got even scarier at times than the first one. I especially liked it when the T-Rex got loose in San Francisco.<br />With &quot;Jurassic Park III,&quot; we got a pretty good dinosaur movie. I didn't think it was as good as the first two, but it was a lot of fun. And we got Pteranadons this time! Well, we got one at the end of The Lost World, but we got a bunch of them this time, and they were sweet! Hopefully in JP4 they'll have the Quetzalcoatlus, which is even larger than the Pteranadon! The whole smart Raptors think got a little carried away I think, but it wasn't as weird after the second viewing. But ultimately, this movie has some amazing special effects shots of both dinos and landscapes, and it's a lot of fun. The only real problem I have with it is that the story isn't as involved as the other two, and it's too short. It's approx. 40 minutes shorter than the previous two films, which is a dramatic change in length of time. Terminator 3 did the same thing too. Also, I thought there were some shots (but not many) of the CGI dinosaurs that weren't rendered as well as the others.<br />The fourth disc contains special features for all three films. I haven't checked out all the special features, but one that was really cool for JP3 was the ILM show or whatever it's called. They had a cool comparion shot reel where they show you the regular shot a couple of times, asking you to guess what's CGI and what's animatronic. I could usually tell, but that was more because of the movement capable with a CGI dinosaur vs. the movement capable with an animatronic dinosaur. We all just know that animatronics are limited in their movement, so they'll bring in a CGI dinosaur when they need more movement and overall capabilities from a creature. But the light, shadow, texture and overall look of both the CGI dinos and the animatronic dinos looked identical to me. It's pretty amazing.<br />Another special feature I watched was the JP2 Compi dance. That was pretty amusing.<br />And of course each film disc also has special features included.<br />Good/Great films, great DVD set.involved as the other two, and it's too short.

B000099T2L|1.0|Aaliyah is much better than Beyonce. If she were still alive Aaliyah would be winning all the awards and Beyonce would be in the background where she should be. I love how she pretends to be friendly when she is a b1tch and hogs the mic. There is no difference between her solo career and her with destiny's child-she just has different backup singers. Kelly Rowland is hot and  has a sweet personality. I would love to be her bf and she is a better actress too. Let's see Kelly's &quot;Stole&quot; compared to Crazy In Love hmmm which ones  better? One tells a meaningful story and is original and the other rips off an oldie tune and features no talent rappers. neways Crazy In Love is sadly the only good track on here the rest are wack i mean Me Myself &amp; I wtf is that supposed to be about and Naughty Girl samples Love 2 Love You Baby which was already sampled and better done for TLCs Im Good At Being Bad. The songs fall flat and are nothing compared to Heather Headly who should have won best new artist and best vocal performance. She is a good businesswoman because she is greedy and pushy but when it comes down to it Aaliyah had it goin not beyonce and if anyone from destiny's child is great it's Kelly Rowland. Even tho  her album was wack it still had a great song on it Stole. Buy Aaliyah's album because we all kno she would have all the roles Beyonce is in now in theaters and all the hype woul dbe around her which is where it should b. RIP Aaliyah :-(

B000069AUI|4.0|I think the music is really great. I think the sound quality... well, sucks. I have many cds... no matter what system I play this cd on it sounds like bleep. If its just me, I apologize, but hard as I try I cannot give this CD a 5 star rating even though the music in my opinion is worthy of that. If you don't mind listening to poor sound quality from a cd, or don't have much of a stereo system to begin with then you won't be bothered by the lack of sound quality here.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I LOVED this movie. I think I loved it so much becasue it made me feel the same way the disney one did when I was little. Its facinating and wonderful and makes you want to be there. I havent read the book. (Really want to now though) I can only compare it to the disney version. Some things are taken to a whole new level. The mermaids are compleatly differnt... but the same. The relationship between Wendy and Peter and the \\"kiss\\" means more now too. You can see how she is caught between the fun of childhood and the wonders of growing up.<br />We are going to let our kids watch this but with us at first. (My daughter will LOVE the faries) I really want my kids to see this but becasue they are preschool age there are some things that need further explaining. There is some violance but its not dwelled on. Good for further discussion.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|I had heard that this was an oscar-worthy movie and was looking forward to seeing it.  Although I found it somewhat entertaining, at times, I generally felt that the story was jerky and disjointed.  I don't mind filling in the blanks a bit when I watch a movie, but this one was asking a little too much.  Bill Murray was quietly entertaining and I liked his performance.  I just feel that the movie lets the audience down  because it doesn't live up to it's initial promise to be an entertaining ride through Tokyo by two lonely people who are kindred spirits in spite of their many differences.  It made a weak attempt at trying to grab at your heartstrings, but the attempt was a little too weak and again, disjointed.  Left me wondering if the real heart of the movie was left on the cutting room floor.

B000000XCD|5.0|Green River is with out a shadow of a doubt the best album that Creedence Clearwater Revival ever recorded! This was the last Creedence Clearwater Revival I bought, and I own them all so I know this is the best. This has been my favorite of the CCR albums ever since I bought it a few years back. This doesnt have a whole bunch of hit singles, though it does have a few.<br />'Green River' is not only the best album CCR ever made but its also my personal favorite CCR song. It has John Fogerty's greatest guitar riff, and the song as a whole is just killer! 'Commotion' is another great song of the album, it wasnt a big hit but it sure is a classic! 'Tombstone Shadow' is a really cool and erie song, its one of the best songs on Green River. 'Wrote A Song For Everyone' is one of my all time favorite CCR songs. 'Bad Moon Rising' and 'Lodi' are both big hits for CCR and 'Bad Moon' can get old after a while, but it sure does have a cool political message. 'Lodi' is the better song though. The rest of the album is slightly weak compared to the other songs but it is still very good.<br />This is the best CCR album you will ever buy, dont buy the best-of's because with a band like CCR you have to buy the albums to get all the really good songs. Dont miss out on this classic rock and roll album!
B0001DI0FI|3.0|nice movie, well shot, well acted.  some parts were cheesy, many scenes involving crowe and his dialogue made you chuckle.  and when he whipped out his violin and started playing classical, a bit over the top to portray him as a gentleman.    <br />overall, it is worth it to watch, but not to buy.  even if this dvd is jammed packed with extras, commentaries, deleted scenes, and alternative endings i would save your $20 and buy something else.

I would buy the other CD's instead but if you are looking for a good compilation this is worth buying.  I wouldn't waste my money on buying the 2 CD set, the B-sides on disc 2 are mostly garbage.
0385504209|3.0|Any time a book inspires such mixed reviews and causes a stir as mighty as The Da Vinci Code, it's worth a read.  There is no easier way to say it:  This is fiction.  Don't take it seriously.  Don't expect miracles or divine enlightenment.  Get involved in the riddles and the symbols and be interested in the way the author ties together so many themes, but for goodness sake, remember it's a work of fiction.  Personally, I had trouble getting into the book at first, but once the characters came together, I was much more interested.  I agree with the reviewer that the characters were very one dimensional, but this is a story focused upon a single goal (sort of), bringing together complete strangers, and taking place inside 24 hours.  I think the interesting thing about this book is that everyone gets something different from it, and it could be worth buying it used for the fun of finding out what you'll get.  Just remember:  IT'S FICTION!
B000000W5H|2.0|After their brilliant work at the end of the sixties and the early seventies-Beggar's Banquet,Exile on Mainstreet,Sticky Fingers-the Stones began the decline which has continued to this day.After those albums the band would be able to ignite briefly on individual songs,but Richards' drug problems and Jagger's desire to be &quot;current&quot; and &quot;valid&quot; combined to cripple the band and the spark had clearly died. This album shows the beginning of the end. There is none of the energy or excitement that drove &quot;Exile&quot; and &quot;Get Your Ya Ya's Out&quot;. This band begans to mark time,and shovel out product for an undemanding fan base that continues to rever the group even though they've sunk to the level of an &quot;oldies reunion&quot; band like the Turtles or the Monkees. This band would continue to sell out concerts and accept giant checks from the corporate sponsers that financed their tours, but the outlaw attitude that created &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; had shriveled as a result of too much smack and too little convictions.
0440238609|2.0|I started out really liking the books, and what religious confusion I had, I expected to be resolved at the end as most novels are, and at least impartial, but I found that what pullman says about religion, well, basically christianity, in these books very disturbing. Pullman's \\"God\\", the Authority, is portrayed as a rather tyrranical ruler who has grown old to the point of death, with the protagonistic angels being against God, and the antagonistic angels are power-hungry and rule creation. Also, some elements of this book are not things i would tell a child to read, such as the evil of the protagonist's demented parents. It has children turning away from what is supposed to be good, and one has killed people. I think the only thing a child could derive from these books is that God is bad, many disturbing thoughts, and moral confusion. It also has a disturbing theory of hell, which everyone goes to and lives in fear and misery for all eternity. In all, this prevented me from properly enjoying a series that was otherwise very well written and exciting.
B000002J1S|5.0|i wonder if the guys in radiohead ever listened to this recording. ...or 'tales from topographic oceans', or learned how to play guitar?
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I sat and watched this until the end which was more than this movie deserved from any brain functioning  human being. I had thought that this could have been an interesting film. Ms. Coppa should consider trade school for the liberal untalented Hollywood off spring. Bill Murray should fire his agent and undergo anger management. He can't be proud of this.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Well, it would've sounded better to have just a few guys in there taking a few chances.  This is so darn even that it doesn't give me much to listen to.  All the classic blues of long ago were spare, punchy arrangements.  These are not.<BR>It's a good set of blues songs to do, but it don't hold a candle to Robert Johnson.  Or maybe that's all it does...
B00005V9QJ|4.0|Live albums are like colds; they affect every artist differently.  More often than not,  they end up being a combination souveneir/contract eater at best, and a<BR>still-life with crowd noise at worst.  Any smart money would say a band like<BR>Sade has no business even attempting a live record, which may be why Lovers<BR>Live  is such an unexpected success.<br />  One might wonder what an outfit that prides itself on concentration, subtlety and<BR>efficiency as much as this one can bring to a live context;  the band cleverly trades excitement for invention...or perhaps RE-invention.  Statements that conclude with a period in the studio versions of these songs are finished with exclamations...and occasionally question marks.  They strut and swagger through the double-time take of  \\"Smooth Operator,\\" pausing only to let bassist<BR>Paul Spencer Denman tickle the air with his high octave break   This is a band confident enough in both their own talent and the  songs themselves  to take issue with the very  intent of the original recordings.  Like a featherweght champ they effortlessly jab, tease, circle and even rope-a-dope the songs.   Vocalist Sade Adu, now a wily veteran after nearly 20 years at this, knows enough to let her bandmates be not only the glue holding her music together, but also the fuel that makes it go.  Using the swooping, deep groove of  Denman's bass as anchor, Adu and her mates  spin their songs into the next level, building the simple lovers' koans of the lyrics into high art; The elemental sentiments of adult romance, as opposed to the thunderous faux-angst of the boy and girl bands.<br /> Nowhere on the record is this more evident than the band's take on \\"Somebody<BR>Already Broke My Heart,\\" from the wildly successful Lovers' Rock.  With Denman and drummer Pete Lewinson  driving the groove deep into the crowd,  Adu and  guest  vocalist Leroy Osbourne pray over the shroud of heartache until they suddenly shock the room with a coda taken from \\"Never As Good As the First Time,\\"  from 1985's Promise.   As the music tenderly punishes the (no doubt<BR>swaying) audience,  a  17 year-old song becomes a comment on a new song.  This brand of hearing deep into a song is something that most bands can't manage in the studio, much less in front of a packed arena.  You can almost see the band,  nodding to each other with knowing smiles as the crowd swoons.  Old skool getting the job done or just a day at the office?  Who cares?  If only every band could punch the clock so elegantly.
038572179X|2.0|Perhaps I'm the wrong kind of reader for this kind of book. I'm not the action-thriller type at all, but this book fails to move. Instead it is full of over-long descriptions of nothing. It takes nearly 200 pages for anything to happen. I enjoy 'getting into' characters, but after this much introduction, I should care about them. I didn't know the characters &amp; I didn't care about them. I found I could quickly scan many pages and not miss a thing. (I almost never do so.) One thing finally happens, which is the unresolved theme of the rest of the book. By the time it's resolved (or rather, NOT resolved) I didn't care any more. The only interesting part was 50 pages in the middle describing the horrors of Dunkirk during WW II.<BR>I know this got all kinds of awards, but I'm sorry - no plaudits from me.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins imparts great anecdotal information and inspiration to the reader in his bestselling book, \\"Good to Great\\". As a consultant on leadership types, I have been recommending to people from all over the world to read this book.

B0000WN03W|5.0|I own both the american and this import version and this collection is far superior with excellent liner notes and pictures-the tracklisting and sequencing are great as well. While the US 2 cds are about 2 hrs total in running time-Each disc here is around 76 minutes...and the additional tracks are fantastic-Please Crawl Out Your Window is a gem- a single in btw Highway 61 and Blonde on Blonde sessions with The Band, THIS TRACK IS worth the price alone as it cant be found outside the  Biograph box set. It is simply prime Dylan at the peak of his powers. I Want You was a top 10 hit even in the states, so it baffles me why it isnt on the american version...while on the 2nd disc-you get prime cuts from his often overlooked Street Legal, some gems from the 80's that you wouldnt like own unless you have all of his albums and Dignity. While It is impossible  to get the essential Dylan done in less than at least 4 to 6 cds for a proper overview(one could use more from his early works and a few more from highway 61, john wesley harding, blood on the tracks, desire and time out of mind)-as a primer this is truly essential if one wants to get introduced to the 20th century's answer to Shakespeare or Wordsworth.
B000060P79|1.0|I understand the catchiness of music like this. But what's with all this &quot;it relates to what teens are going through&quot; bullcrap?&quot; If this music is so catchy and upbeat, why would you want to hear about some kid who is mad at his parents?  The music doesn't fit with the lyrical content.  To any teenagers who are full of rage and angst and want to relate so something musically, I recommend alternative bands of the 90's like the Smashing Pumpkins.  Billy Corgan showed true emotion through his music, and i think many teens can seriously relate to him,  and not this fabricated, spiky-haired garbage that has taken over popular music...no, not rock. Rock is dead.
B000060P79|3.0|haha yes this band is not original, not that great and just sell outs. But i own this album because A. it wuz on sale and B. i like a few songs on here. This album is just a whole bunch of generic pop &quot;punk&quot; and i'm sure if you are in middle school or high school, you justt might like it. However, this album is not as bad as its evil twin WAKEFIELD. since i gave them a 2, i'm giving simple plan a 3.
0156027321|2.0|After reading \\"Life of Pi\\" my faith has been much stronger.  After Pi had gone through his terror and fear of the ocean, there must have been a God there for him.  I love the way that Yan Martel uses the animals as passengers instead of humans.  I think it adds something more.  I believe that Richard Parker is a character that excites his readers.  Richard Parker is made out to be the character that does things that are surprising to the audience.  This keeps the readers on their toes.  I really did not like the beginning f the story.  It seemed as though the introduction went on and on with no reasoning.  The first part of the novel was dragging on about religions and Pi's background.  It easily could have been broken into two or three chapters.  I also did not like the ending.  I believe that the first story is true but I am still confused as to why Yan Martel chose to have Pi tell the reporters a totally different story.  I loved the entire part of the story when he was on the ship.  I thought it was very interesting and educational.  I liked the adventure but the beginning and ending were not pleasing to me.  If I were to rate this book on a scale from 0 to 10 I would have to give it a 5.  Yan Martel did very well with mixing extreme adventure with religion but I think that some of the parts of the novel dragged on and on, but overall I enjoyed the book.
B0000027RL|5.0|Well, with Stone Temple Pilots calling it quits, Pearl Jam is left standing as the only band from the magical grunge era of the early '90's. And perhaps they were destined to be; if you notice, all of those great bands during that time period, all of them had problems either with drugs or internal tensions within each other. While there's always gonna be argument with what band and album was the best(and I think it's Alice In Chains and there second album &quot;Dirt&quot;), Pearl Jam's debut &quot;Ten&quot; is certanily in the running. A commercial and artistic juggernaut that rivals only Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; and Metallica's &quot;Metallica&quot; in influence in modern rock, &quot;Ten&quot; might just outshine them all. While all the members are great at what they do, there are two in particular that spur this band on; Mike McCready(&quot;Alive&quot; might<BR>have the best guitar solo of the last ten years) and the magnificent Eddie Vedder. A little more about Vedder; I have never heard a vocalist, with maybe the exeption of Chris Cornell and Layne Staley(or even Mahalia Jackson or Janis Joplin, for that matter) sing with such passion or reckless abandon(check &quot;Black, &quot;Jeremy&quot; or &quot;Even Flow&quot; for that)While were comparing him to soul singers, he just might be the white Marvin Gaye; nobody these days sings more verile about social issues so geniuinely. While they've spawned their share of imitators(can you say Creed?!),there's nobody in there class. Nobody.

Babies and children would not talk like this if adults did not teach them to! People who do so should hang their heads in shame.  Teach your children the correct names for their body parts and they wont grow up so repressed.  I couldn't even donate this book to charity for fear soome unsuspecting person might buy it, first I let my youngest use it as a teather and then I pitched it! (...)

0440237688|4.0|The Giver<BR>By: Lois Lowry<BR>Reviewed By: S. Chang <BR>Period: 5<br /> The Giver is about a boy named Jonas, who lives in a community that doesn [] let you have choices, with nothing like love, hate, music, color, emotions, weather, fear, and family. Everything is rules, rules, and rules. People live in the same routine, nothing new, no freedom; everything is the same and plain, even the weather. In this community, there is the [] Ceremony of Twelve[], a ceremony that chooses a twelve-year-olds job. Jonas is chosen to be the Receiver of Memory¡[], the most honored, painful, and rare job. Through this job, he is able to see the memories of the past, which shows him everything he doesn¡¯t have in the Community. He learns about emotions, weather, color, and family. Then he finds out what a controlled place he [is] living in.<BR><BR>The plot was very interesting and made me attached to the book and is very touching. Although I really enjoyed reading this book, it was too confusing. While I was reading The Giver, my mind became unorganized. It never really gives us an explanation of the Community, as if it assumes that we know about how the Community works, which we don[]t. <BR> <BR>I didn¡[]t even know there was no color for the people in the community until I read half of the book. I realized for the first time that the Community didn¡[]t have color when the Giver said, []Once, back in the time of the memories, everything had a shape and size, the way things still do, but they also had a quality called color.¡[] I also didn¡[]t know there wasn¡[]t weather in the Community until Jonas thought, []Suddenly the perceived the word from it: sunshine¡[]. <br />My favorite part of the book is when Jonas first receives the memory of family and love. It finally gave him emotions, and it made him more like a person. I think the basic emotional needs are love and family. What is the difference from a robot from a human if there is no love and family? In the community, they erased love and family out of their lives, the basic emotions of a person. When Jonas received the memory of love and family, it made me think of Jonas more of a person.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|I have seen Springsteen live and he is truly a legend.  This DVD is the next best thing to seeing him live.  I don't understand the complaints regarding the sound - this is a live concert, there is no lip-synching here.  It's a true live raw performance.  A gem no doubt about it.<BR>Five starts and more.
B000002HJD|5.0|Crimson and clover? Why don't you compare Wayne Newton to Primus? Anyways, this review isn't a bash; it's my feelings about the album.  First of all \\"American Prayer\\" isn't an album that you just pick one or two songs off of to listen to, it's a story, similar to Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"The Wall,\\" or Neilson's \\"The Point.\\"  And similar to those in that it is best enjoyed relaxing on your couch, following the inebriant of your choice.  It also is great for long road trips at night, but I prefer to have my eyes closed when listening to it.  Jim's poetry is raw and vibrant and conjures up images of the movies The Doors and Natural Born Killers. The background music adds to the poetry like the sense of smell does to taste.  As a second generation door's fan, my view of this album may be slightly nostalgic, but listening to it, for me, is like a vivid dream that captures something reminiscent of Manson's views of the 60's. It's filled with intenseness of peaking on window pane (LSD, for the sheltered) and the spacey philosophical ranting that accompany its come-down.  This album is art and contains all the passion and skewed visions of the artist. I would compare this album to something like sushi; at first it may sound repulsive to some, but if given a chance you may start to crave it.  If this doesn't sound like your spicy tuna roll, then maybe you can go back to mind-numbing, sticky-sweet pop music and other mass media produced nausients, and leave interpretation of art to someone else. Okay, it is kind of a bash.
0385510438|1.0|Not since The Firm has Grisham managed to reach the same level of intensity. The Last Juror is awkward, predictable, and at times awfully dull. The Client and The Partner were close, but it seems to me that Grisham has succumbed to his fame and perhaps thinks people will like anything he writes. A Painted House, Bleachers, Skipping Christmas; yuck. I knew who the killer in this book was long before he was supposed to be, or should have been, exposed.  If you feel you must buy this book simply because the author is Grisham, do yourself a favor and wait for the paperback.
0743454529|1.0|I bought the book because of this sudden hype about Picoult.  Well, folks, I hate to tell you, it's another one of those incidents where the publisher decides to sell more books by a certain author and Picoult happens to be the flavor of the month.  The book has an intriguing premise, and certainly deserves a more engaging way to tell the story - something which Picoult doesn't have.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album marked Metallica's last true heavy album. It is their best. Without a doubt. <br />I need to point out something though. All the other reviews I read didn't mention the best song in the album, Metallica's best song, easily my favorite song, and Metal's shining moment. \\"BLACKENED.\\" This defines METAL. The main riff is like no one elses. I don't know if James or Kirk wrote it but it is pure magic. And for the rest of the riffs, there couldn't have been any other. <br />The rest of the album is just as good. Get this album. <br />And don't be weak and say your favorite song is One. That was my favorite of the album when I got it. Untill I started to realize true metal.

B0000DD7LC|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  Her first cd wasn't very good; only 3 good songs, but this is simply incredible.  All of the songs stand out.  The best part is that they are different from one another.  If I have to pick a favorite song, it will be &quot;Karma&quot;, although all the others are excellent too.  I just wish she would have included &quot;Streets of New York&quot;, but that's record bussiness.  Buy this album; you won't regret it.
B000084T18|5.0|This is the first classic CD of the new millenium. Top to bottom not a weak song. Fiddy flows like lava, and Dre provides the beat on 4 songs, how can you go wrong. In da club is instant classic. And u have in addition 19 other cuts on the album that are skip proof. Fifty flows over any beat, showing his versatility. Lyrical content is of course arguable and sometimes very questionable eg. P.I.M.P, but a lyrical genius he defn. is, he moves effortlessly from the rediculously funny and entertaining, like 'Wanksta', to the serious like 'Many men'. In addition the man is a captivating story teller, like few b4 him. Easily offended people should of course stay away but if your used to the hip hop u should definitely get it.

B0000648WZ|1.0|I would say the most important element in any film is good characters that the viewer can identify with. But all the humans in this film are members of Nazi society who are brainwashed into killing aliens. We can't relate to these people, or care about them - it's hard to even like them; so enjoying the movie is a struggle. To make things worse, the main characters are hammy, and given a feeble plot (I suspect deliberately so, to emphasise the satire).<br />What this boils down to is a retrospectively amusing 90 minute satirical statement about Nazis and propaganda. But I found it impossible to enjoy as a film because of the lack of the key elements that any good film must have. The only people I can imagine liking this are people who enjoy CGI and don't care about characters (the very same people who like Star Wars Episode I).
6302878527|5.0|A funny, subtle, bittersweet and skillfully constructed look at one couple's courtship and sometimes-rocky marriage, as seen in a series of interwoven narratives, all during trips through France in the 1950s and '60s.  Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn portray the Wallaces, he an irascible, prickly young architect, she, his indefatigably cheery, clear-eyed wife.  The dizzying, back-and-forth cross-chronological editing can be a bit disorienting, but the script is incredibly skillful, and the tart dialogue takes on an aching, painful resonance.  Plus, Hepburn is such a doll.  Great clothes, great old cars and outlandishly modern architecture and interior design -- a great glimpse into the Euro-American middle class of the late 'Fifties and early 'Sixties, when the world was their oyster, and love was in the air.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|I would like to start out sayin illmatic is one of the hottest rap albums to drop but making a &quot;10 year anniversity edition&quot; was a waste of time.  If you already have Illmatic (which most people do) why waste your money and buy another copy of the exact same album with 4 remixed tracks and 2 new ones when nas is comming out w/a double album in the summer?? It would of been hotter if Nas remixed all the illmatic tracks maybe w/ some of the old producers and new producers like kanye west or clue (agreeing with another review I saw on here) and making new tracks for illmatic was a mistake.  I know Nas has some other songs other then what was on lost tapes.  Nas is def hot right now but it was pointless to remake illmatic. Can't wait for the double album to drop, that sh*ts gonna be hot
B000006045|5.0|THIS CD IS THE BEST TRIP HOP HAS TO OFFER.  It is slow (at times) electronic-ish and dark sounding.  I love it, you may not!  There is no good way for me to explain it but know that it is not your avrage pop cd and don't buy it if what you want, is.  This is the cd that brought me to liking Trip Hop and it is still my definate favorite!  You may still like it if you don't like much other tip hop because it is so finominal, so listen to the samples they have here.  also some of the songs were in movies you might have seen.  The song Angle is in the movie Snatch.  It plays while Brad Pit's mom's house is burning.  some others, along with Angle, are in that crazy movie Pi but I am not sure when they play.  This is a great cd that has infuenced many music types, but know what your getting into before you buy it.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Guns n Roses Greatest Hits CD collects all of their radio hits and a few other songs onto one CD.14 tracks doesn't seem like very much, and I wouldn't exactly call Ain't that Fun,Since I Don't Have You, or Sympathy for the Devil essential or hits,but for the most part the CD is right on the mark with good sound quality also.For the casual fan who is only familiar with Guns n Roses from the radio &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; would be a good purchase to start with,I also recommend &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; where all the songs are as good as the hits.
0385504209|2.0|I'd heard so much about this book from so many people that my expectations were quite high.  I was expecting a gripping page-turner that would leap off the pages and knock me on my keister.<br />Instead, I got a rather mediocre work of fiction whose sole claim to fame was that it explored some dubious alternative philosophy about the history of Christ and the Grail mixed in with some cheesy secret society slop and some toying with da Vinci's symbolism.<br />As far as an overview of the whole Grail-Magdalene bit, it does a fair job of summarizing it for those who are too lazy to do their own research (90% of the theories espoused in the book I had heard before).  As a work of fiction, however, it is sub-par.  It is painfully clear that it was more important to the &quot;author&quot; to convey his pet theories than it was to create believable characters and plot.<br />I was looking forward to finding out why so many people I know had read or were reading this book.  Now that I've read it, I still don't know the answer to that question, and I wish I had invested my time in a higher caliber of literature.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|When I reach for my Dream Theater CDs, I'm looking for an outrageous musical experience.  Train of Thought picks up right where The Glass Prison left off (undeniably the best track from a lackluster Six Degrees album) and delivers.  Take it or leave it, on this album the boys look to drop your jaw with excessive speed over thick and ballsy riffs, with great success.  Rudess and Petrucci have never sounded better since Jordan joined the band, dueling and exchanging solos throughout the album (save the first keyboard-less track).  Although sometimes the musical interludes seem out of place or even pointless, they will never cease to blow your mind.  Seeing them play it live is all the more mind-boggling.  How they remember it all, it's hard to imagine.<br />For those of you who think Petrucci plays with no soul, listen to the &quot;soaring&quot; melody throughout This Dying Soul.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|i disagree with most of the previous reviews, as i believe that this is thoughtful work that works.  <br />i'm not the biggest sarah mclachlan fan, and i think she can be a little naive, but honestly, this is one of those records that grows on a person.  at first it will seem like a 'surfacing' reprise (or attempt at a reprise), but once you really get to know this work you will realize that it's very strong, and not much like 'surfacing' at all.  <br />'afterglow' is an appropriate title.  however, the album cover is ultra cheesy, the photographer should have been replaced.  i mean, what is she doing there?  is she preforming what is suppose to be an afterglow?  come on sarah, the act is up, you're not an innocent, bright-eyed halifax girl anymore... get with it... start employing new creative minds that will further your work, not ruin it through misrepresentation.

B00006V9A0|5.0|This is the greatest hits collection for Nirvana that Kurt Cobain never did. It is a good buy if you want almost all of the classic Nirvana songs except Polly and Lounge Act on one CD. To have all your favorite Nirvana songs on one CD is very convenient. It is impossible to know if Kurt Cobain himself would have chosen all of these songs or would even have wanted a greatest hits collection. However such a collection was needed and it is not bad. All of the songs on this CD are great and much has been said about every one except the one that most people buy this CD for: You know you're right. I adore this song. The lyrics of this song speak of a ending of something because of the carelessness of other people they know they're right-only, they aren't. Whatever the relevance of this song to Kurt Cobain's life, this song perfectly combines defeat and strength. The power in the ending the song speaks of is the ability to know that after that there will be no more misunderstanding. This last song of Nirvana's is one of their best songs. It is my third favorite song after Smells like teen spirit and Dumb. It is a nice song to listen to when you are sad. That was, after all, Nirvana's power- many of their songs are about sadness, despair, and apathy. So many people can relate to that. ''This is begining to sound the same/ I miss the comfort in being sad.''
B00018D44U|5.0|I recently listened to Norah Jones's new album Feel Like Home and it is pure greatness. I have not had the chance to purchase the CD yet but every song that I listened to was beautiful and very touching. I give this CD 5 stars for the beautiful vocals and heart wrenching music.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Eric Clapton's new disk of Robert Johnson cover tunes &quot;Me And Mr. Johnson&quot; is a mixed bag.  I was really excited when I read Eric Clapton was going to release an album of Robert Johnson cover tunes.  He has released a number of Robert Johnson cover tunes over the course of his career and I thought this would contain more of the same.  The disk while containing competent playing focuses more on Clapton's vocals (which have improved over the years) than his guitar playing.  My own personal favorites include &quot;Traveling Riverside Blues&quot;, &quot;Come In My Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Love In Vain&quot;  &quot;Milkcow's Calf Blues&quot; and &quot;32-20 Blues&quot;.  However, the power of the original versions by Johnson is lacking for the most part on this disk.  Since it is probably impossible for Clapton to capture the feeling of the originals he might have been better off changing the arrangements somewhat.  The low key mostly acoustic playing on this disk invites comparisons with Johnson that do Clapton no benefit at all. His previous covers of Johnson tunes like &quot;Crossroads&quot;, &quot;Steady Rollin' Man&quot; and &quot;Ramblin' On My Mind&quot; are more effective than anything on this disk.  It may be because Clapton opted to go all out electric so that the comparisons with Johnson's originals aren't as pronounced.  Billy Preston's piano is evident thoughtout and is one of the highlights of the disk.  It is more to the forefront on some songs than even Clapton's guitar playing.  The disk is more like his acoustic album &quot;Unplugged&quot; album than &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot;.  Comparing the Rolling Stones arrangement of &quot;Love In Vain&quot; helps prove my point.  Mick Taylor's playing on the Stones' version is so full of emotion it makes you want to cry.  While Clapton's playing is slick, it just does not affect me the way Johnson's original or the Stones' version does. The disk is sort of a microcosm of Eric Clapton's solo career.  Itis at times brilliant and other times too laid back.  Since we know what Eric Clapton is capable of, this proves to be a frustrating listen at times.  Perhaps we expect too much of Eric Clapton these days!
B000002W9P|5.0|Wow!  Now, THIS is an album.  And it's only 33 mintues long, too.  &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Future World&quot; are two completely killer rock songs with great solos and the vocals that every power metal band wishes they had.  &quot;A Tale That Wasn't Right&quot; is a great rockin' ballad.  &quot;Halloween&quot; is a 13-minute epic of screaming vocals, screaming guitar solos, pounding bass and drums, and it just completely rocks your face off.  The intro and outro are good, but I wouldn't exactly review a CD on those merits.  The two songs I didn't talk about are good, but just don't stay with me the way the others do.  Recommended for fans of:  Iron Maiden, Gamma Ray, Judas Priest, or just about any other power metal band.
B00002Z88D|4.0|As a group, Metallica isn't a stranger to classical music; the intro to &quot;Am I Evil&quot; from &quot;Kill 'Em All&quot; is actually a section from Gustav Holst's &quot;Mars: The Bringer of War&quot; from &quot;The Planets&quot;. I was raised on classical music, and discovered Metallica in my teen years. I never dreamed of hearing the two combined, so imagine my surprise at hearing of this collaboration.<br />According to an article in Rolling Stone magazine, legendary film director Francis Ford Coppola stormed out of this concert in disgust; as a classical music fan (and a season-ticket holder with the San Francisco Symphony), he apparently hated the melding of his beloved symphony with metal music. He should've stuck around, because he might have been heartened by the audience's reaction. The metal crowd actually gets into the classical sound; just listen to the beginning of &quot;-Human&quot;. It was a new song, never before heard by the live audience. Yet, as the orchestra pounds away at the hammerblows of the first twenty-four seconds of the song, the audience begins chanting in perfect unison, providing a perfect accompaniment to the orchestra, carrying on the chant even as the orchestra switches gears just before Metallica kicks in. Absolutely glorious. They even cheer in response during the string section's brief bridge interlude in &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;. In the same vein, the crowd's reaction to the album opener - a shortened version of Ennio Morricone's &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold,&quot; from &quot;The Good, The Bad And The Ugly,&quot; performed without Metallica - is awesome. The bell hit that opens the piece sounds like the opening to Metallica's &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;; maybe that's what made everyone cheer. Nonetheless, I wish I had been there to see Metallica walk onstage to such heroic-sounding music.<br />My favorite tracks on this set are &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;, &quot;Battery&quot;, and &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot;. The mastery of &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; is a given, since conductor Michael Kamen arranged the original version, and he expounds on his work here, but his takes on &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Sandman&quot; are especially memorable. The extended intro to &quot;One&quot;, even with the Vietnam War-sound effects at the beginning (helicopters and machine guns in the background), is haunting. <br />Of course, Metallica is in high form throughout. It's kinda funny to hear the rhythm guitar in &quot;Puppets&quot;; it sounds like James Hetfield has slowed down the song's tempo a bit so the orchestra can keep up. You shouldn't hate the group for trying something different. Some of their songs have always sounded like mini-symphonies played with guitars, and the orchestra proves how brilliant Hetfield and Co. were at writing and arranging their songs.<br />As for the late conductor and film composer Michael Kamen, I admit I was a bit skeptical. When I heard his name attached to this work, I immediately thought of his music for the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies, and I thought his collaboration with Metallica would sound cheesy - or, at least, not fitting of Metallica. Boy, was I wrong. I hadn't considered his best work - the stunning score to &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (VERY expensive and hard to find, unfortunately), his collaboration with Queensryche on &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot;, or his work with Pink Floyd on songs such as &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. Kamen is the real star of this album. His arrangements of Metallica's songs are excellent, and his love and knowledge of rock music shines through here. If you love Kamen's music, this is a must-have.<br />I think this is an excellent CD. Not every song is a gem (I could've done without &quot;Hero of the Day&quot; and &quot;Fuel,&quot; which knock off a star), but there's a lot to recommend here. Therehave been &quot;symphonic tributes&quot; to other rock groups, but this set blows them all out of the water. If you're a fan of Metallica, and/or the music of Michael Kamen, you owe it to yourself to get this album.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I gave this album a couple of listens, and I'm sorry to say that I just couldn't get into it.  I'm a relatively new Maiden fan, but I love almost all their work with either Bruce or Paul.  Anyway, after you get past the horrendous cover art, the musical content seems really good, but in my opinion this release completely paled to &quot;Brave New World.&quot;  BNW sounds like a revitalized band - and they WERE a revitalized band with the re-addition of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith.  By comparison, &quot;Dance of Death&quot; sounds more like a band locking into autopilot or &quot;resting on their laurels,&quot; if you will.  That said, it's not a bad album, but if I saw someone standing in front of the Iron Maiden section at my local music retailer with this and &quot;Brave New World&quot; in their hands and a confused look on their face, I'd point them in the direction of BNW.
B00006HAZG|3.0|Being a fan of the classic by Dickens, (it is in my top ten), I was naturally inclined to want to see the movie versions of this wonderful work of literature.<br /><br />  Actaully I had seen one on A&E, and while I don't really remember much about it, I did enjoy it enough to have a desire to read the book. Ah, contentment. Nothing like a well written novel. I enjoyed it so much, I decided to read it out loud to my wife, something that we love to do with great works that are written in a style that just begs to be spoken. There is something about it that just brings an enrichment to the stories that can sometimes be missed otherwise.<br />  Anyhow, after this treasured experience, we both wanted to see the A&E version. But try as I might, I couldn't find it released on DVD or VHS. So I turned to the altenatives. I read the reviews for this BBC version right here on Amazon, and I must say I was impressed. Almost every review was a good one, and much was said about how close this was to the book. The people who had seen this and the A&E version even told me this was much superior.<br />  So I happily plunked down the money for this movie. We invited our friend Ian who had recently pleasured himself by reading the book. We watched. By the time it was over I was wishing that I hadn't read all those reviews. False hope and all that dashed nonsense. I also wished that I had seen this before reading the book. (I know that by saying this I am totally contradicting my review of Austen's book \\"Northanger Abbey\\", but in this case I was wrong.) Not that it is a bad movie, but like my wife said, \\"It was just a skeleton of the book\\".<br />  So I shall give a list of the things I didn't like, followed by those that I did.<br /><br />1. The movie just whizzed by from scene to scene, as if they were in a hury to get to the end. Three hours is three hours, but a good director, coupled with nice editing can make a movie feel smoother and seem longer, without giving you that ancy feeling you could be doing something else.<br />2. There were quite a few well written characters missing, or just having brief cameos. Some of the missing who were in my mind vital to the story: Traddle, Dora' two birdlike aunts, and Doctor and Mrs. Strong. Not so important, but still missed by me: The Old Soldier (Mrs. Markleham), Mr Omer, Mr. Joram, And the unforgetable Miss Mowcher.<br />3. The scene where everyone confronts Uriah Heep is way to short. It felt like it took all of about a minute, where as in the book it took up almost an entire chapter, fiiled with rich speech from all the characters, most notably Micawber, who couldn't say the name Heep without going almost into a fit of rage, while here he says Heep that way maybe twice, then mellowing out his tone for the rest of the scene.<br />4. I don't like how they split the DVD like you are watching it on PBS by having the credits halfway through, then you get to watch a preview of what you are going to watch in a few minutes, and then a rehash of what you just watched. Maddening!<br />  Good points.<br />1. While there was a lot left out, they didn't deviate from the storyline hardly at all.<br />2. Seeing David's aunt tearing into the Murdstones was almost perfect.<br />3. Mr. Dick was just how I imagined him, especially in the kite flying scene with him twirling his cane in the air with his childish excitement. Seeing David's smile during this scene was very nice to.<br />4. Most notable performances: the young David (an awesome career lies ahead of this boy), Peggotty, Mr. Peggotty, Ham (especially when talking of his love for Emily), Mr. Micawber (while not how I imagined him, was still excellently done), Mrs. Micawber, Miss Trotwood, Uriah Heep (definatly portraying sinister), and Rosa Darttle.<br />  I would recomend this movie to a few select groups. If you are curious and have read the book, then I would say, try to rent or borrow this before purchasing. Who knows you might like it. Or if you are acollector of great literary books brought to life, and finally, if you have never read the book, then try watching this and see if you want to read it then.<br />  I would not recomend letting children view this until you yourself have screened it and decided its ok, because there are some scenes that could be very disturbing to youngters, and the first half of the movie has a dark feel about it as well.<br /><br />  My only hope is that someday soon, someone will put up the money for a proper mini-series to be done. Something in the range of six to ten hours would be nice. And it can be done. Just look at Pride & Prejudice, coming in at five hours long, with the book being a little over 300 pages, while Copperfield rests at a nice long 850 pages.<br />  And so I wait....reat literary books brought to life, and finally, if you have never read the book, then try watching this and see if you want to read it then.<br />  I would not recomend letting children view this until you yourself have screened it and decided its ok, because there are some scenes that could be very disturbing to youngters, and the first half of the movie has a dark feel about it as well.<BR> <BR>  My only hope is that someday soon, someone will put up the money for a proper mini-series to be done.

B000066NW0|1.0|In my opinion, this cd was the most odd thing I ever listened to. This young women is singing about problems that are effecting her life. I just don't see why she has to sing about that. Most of her songs are negative and include one of her worldly problems. Avril has a great voice, but she is definatly not using it in the right way. Just by looking at the cover, you can already tell that she is angry about something. Although many may in joy this, for me this cd was very digrceful indeed.
B000063147|5.0|You'd think most of the people who enjoyed Waking the Fallen would pick this one up. But anyway,<br />I love Avenged Sevenfold. This being the second CD i bought (WtF the first obviously), i initially was put off by it. Maybe it was the lack of actual sung vocals, or maybe...well, i don't know. But give this one more than a few tries you WILL be hooked. The CD reeks of metalcore, mixed with old school maiden (for a lack of a better comparision) and some punk thrown in too. Odd mix, but they make it work wonders. Some songs are very epic (Warmness of the Soul, Shattered by Broken Dreams, We Come Out at Night) and others rip your face off (Turn the Other Way, An Epic of Time Wasted, The Art of Subconcious Illusion). It's pretty balanced, except for Streets. Despite the fact that i really do enjoy the song, it feels very out of place here. What it all comes down to is that by the end of a few listens, you will know this CD rocks. It's original, melodic and grinding at the same time.<br />Hell, this CD even converted a good friend of mine who is most likely usually listening to terrible radio rap and trapt. Thank god i can listen to something decent when with him now.<br />In conclusion, ask yourself these questions: Do you like original metalcore? Can you stand large amounts of growls and screams? If yes, buy this immediately. It will defintely be a prize in your collection.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I said it and I stand by it- in a year of rap-crap,rage rock,and mindless drivel and garbage,this was easily the best album around-the Beatles forever!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I loved this film.  Having lived in Japan as a young woman, I could completely understand Charlotte's sense of fragility in a foreign place when she felt equally foreign to herself.  Imagine graduating from any philosophy department only to realize that life isn't at all what you've been told, most people you meet couldn't care less who Aristotle was, you're criticized for being smart and labeled an elitist.  That actually sounds like many of the reviews this film has received on this site.  For the poetic, this film is breathtaking and sumptuous.  It's just like perfume to me.
B0000062Y2|3.0|A lot of Christians consider Jesus Christ Superstar to be sacrilegious as it makes Judas a sympathetic character and basically portrays Jesus as just a confused human who experiences no resurrection after he is crucified. I don't think it would weaken anyone's faith at all though and for some people might actually do the opposite. Not everyone is influenced by the traditional portrayals of Jesus. Anyway, onto the music...<br />Overall the music in this recording is not as strong as the original cast album from 1970 but I do enjoy the movie so I recommend the DVD instead for this version because the visuals offer another interpretation for the music. For some reason the music isn't recorded very well and it sounds like it was a rushed recording. Also, much of the time the vocals are far too loud in relation to the instruments.<br />I don't find Ted Neeley to be strong enough in his portrayal of Jesus. I find his voice very thin a lot of the time and he often seems to sing behind the beat - yet he was a drummer! He does a fine job on some numbers though, such as \\"Gethsemane (I Only Want To Say)\\". In the early nineties I saw Neeley and the late Carl Anderson revise their roles on stage and Carl's voice sounded amazing, his singing had got even better than it was on this recording. I am not sure which version of Judas I prefer, but probably Murray Head's original appeals to me more since it's the version I grew up listening to. Both Head & Anderson have strong voices and sing their part with great feeling.<br />I like the way each song segued into the next on the original recording whereas in this version there are often long gaps between the songs. The addition of \\"Then We Are Decided\\" may add a bit to the story but is very dull musically but \\"Could We Start Again Please\\" is a nice tune. However, I think it might have fit better musically after \\"Judas' Death\\". I do like the extra verse in \\"Hosanna\\" and the semi-psychotic Simon in \\"Simon Zealotes\\" but I don't like the lyric changes to \\"The Temple\\" and miss the \\"HEAL YOURSELVES!\\" line when Jesus encounters the lepers.<br />The Annas in this version sings in a silly sounding high falsetto whereas in the original Brian Keith belted out his lines in full voice. I also don't like the way a lot of the lines are spoken or half-spoken instead of sung. I find the 'Peter' in this recording's voice to be a bit weak too...he's not as convincing when he says \\"I don't know him!\\" during \\"Peter's Denial\\". The guy who sings \\"King Herod's Song\\"  is no Mike D'Abo (the original singer) but with the visuals he's funny. And finally, the Crucifixion on the original recording is a bizarre, scary track whereas here it's a bit weak. Do buy the DVD if you like this version, even though the current release is not in anamorphic widescreen.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|The most dissappointing FM album I've ever heard. Ecclectic, self-indulgent and dull. If you are a fan of the Rumers-era Mac, this is not for you. Songs lack melody and charm. Most fall victim to Mr. Buckingham's penchant for over-production and his typical \\"let's see how far out I can get\\" attitude. The songs on \\"The Dance\\" were all FAR superior to anything on this album. I don't know what happened. My advice would be to listen to as many samples as you can before you fork out the dough. I wish I would've.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|US Title <BR>Big Show (c) vs. John Cena<BR>This match was surprisingly decent. It was a little slow, but did a good job of making both guys look good. There was only one really big problem with this match: a minute-long rest hold is a bit much for a 10 minute match. *3/4<br />World Tag Team Titles<BR>Booker T & RVD (c) vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Cade & Jindrak vs. La Ressistance<BR>Isn't this great? A match with no build and members of the HEAT crew on \\"the grandest stage\\". Match was a whole lot of nothing, but nothing un bearable or anything. *<br />Chris Jericho vs. Christian<BR>Now, this is more like it. A pretty good match with both guys busting out some cool moves. Jericho isn't as good a brawler as he is with his normal style, but he worked pretty hard here and pulled off a pretty good match with Christian. ***<br />The Rock & Sock connection vs. Evolution<BR>Throwing in Rock sort of killed all the good build, as he was only involved in this for 2 weeks while Foley and Orton had been feuding for months, but I guess in the end having Flair and Rock in to help Foley carry Batista and Orton was good. Match wasn't anything special, but Flair was really on here and anything Flair-Rock is absolute gold. **3/4<br />Interpromotional match<BR>Sable & Torrie vs. Jackie & Stacy<BR>Well... I can't really complain, as I didn't expect anything and they kept it short. Still.. if they were going to do something like this, they could have included celebrities like XIX, just to make it feel WM-like as apposed to something you can see on every RAW and SD. DUD<br />Cruiserweight Championship<BR>Cruiserweight Open <BR>No match up was actually given enough time to be good, but the whole thing was pretty fun as it was loaded with cool cruiser spots. **<br />Interpromotional match<BR>Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar<BR>Special Ref: Steve Austin<BR>This was pure crap and a really bad note for Lesnar to leave on. DUD<br />WWE Tag Team Titles<BR>Rikishi & Scotty (c) vs. WGTT vs. APA vs. The Bashams<BR>Unlike the RAW tag match, this did have one or two weeks of buld, but it is definitley not a WM-level match, as every one of these teams aside from WGTT should be on Velocity. The match was just like the RAW tag match, excpet a minute (or two) shorter. *<br />WWE Womens Championship<BR>Hair vs. Title<BR>Victoria (c) vs. Molly Holly<BR>It was pretty good, but didn't last very long. *1/4<br />WWE Championship<BR>Eddie Guerrero (c) vs. Kurt Angle<BR>Easily the MOTN. Kurt was good, but Eddie was just excellent in this match. Great, lengthy match, with a good finish, fitting of Eddie's character. ****<br />Interpromotional match<BR>Undertaker vs. Kane<BR>This was pretty bad, but it got the point across (The dead man is back and ready to squash everyone in his path), and since I am a big Kane fan, I'll be generous. *1/4<br />World Heavyweight Championship<BR>Triple H (c) vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels<BR>This match was good, but terribly over-rated. It was a fun triple threat match and that is just about it. ***1/4<br />A very well put together video package closes the show.<br />Overall thoughts:<BR>Well... there is a lot of crap on here, but Eddie-Kurt is great; the triple threat and Jericho-Christian are good, and the cruiser open is fun to watch. Plus, if you hate Goldberg or Brock, you might want to see them get booed out of the building. If you only buy a few WWE PPVs on VHS/ DVD, I wouldn't recommend this, but if you get most, then this is definitely something you should check out, if just for Eddie/ Kurt.<br />As a show this was good, but as a WM this was just ok. It's on a similar level as WM 2000 (which also featured a few good matches and a lot of crap), but it's crap compared to XIX or X-Seven.
0140072187|5.0|This is the first book I've read on this topic, so I can't compare it to any others. It was certainly very, very good.<br /> I found it a difficult read, probably because I only read magazine articles, and am not used to reading stuff with dialog or narratives.<br /> I think that you get a pretty good idea of how pilots coped with getting in and out of dangerous areas, often under attack.<br /> Mason decides not to re-enlist after returning to the U.S., even though he's promised Captain's bars. Is he nuts? I guess he'd have to be nuts, just to survive the awful things he had to endure while flying. He flew a Huey slick, that is, he carried troops and supplies. (a** and trash, as he calls it)<br /> My main interest was how helicopters work and how pilots deal with tough terrain. I suppose search-and-rescue helicopter stories would interest me equally.<br /> You'll read about his opinions on the war, and how the horrors of war really messed him up. The book gives a quote stating that helicopter crews, infantry and the Marines always have the highest mortality.<br /> The book gave some insight into what the Vietnam war was like. To me, that was just a bonus, as I really only read it to learn about helicopters.<br /> This is the first book I've read about helicopters or combat. It was time well spent. If you care, he's written a sequel about how he messes up badly when he gets back to civilian life. <BR> I personally will pass on it, though if its written as well as this book, could be a good read for someone who's interested in the psychology of ex-soldiers.
B000099T2L|3.0|I've seen a lot of reviews of this album that have said this and I must agree--the first half of this CD is the best.  I truly despise &quot;Signs&quot; and &quot;Gift from Virgo.&quot;  However, the CD is saved by songs like &quot;Crazy in Love,&quot; &quot;Me, Myself and I,&quot; and &quot;Be With You.&quot;  I guess in sum, the good songs are really good, and the bad songs are really bad.  But, this was just her first...we certainly have not heard the last from Ms. Beyonce.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|As a fan of the Matrix franchise, I was anxiously awaiting this third installment, but was sorely disappointed.  I even defended \\"Reloaded\\" to my friends who were hell-bent on trashing the franchise based on the second chapter.<br />What can you say about this festering pile of ... other than it is a movie that can only be tolerated by the few people who \\"get\\" the Wachowski's  rambling and too-often ridicous theo-philosophy.  the only redeeming moment of the film is when Trinity FINALLY dies after her monologue which seems to take as long as the entire Rings trilogy.<br />The fights were unfulfilling, the usually great supporting characters are pathetic, and the graphics brought nothing new to the discussion. No wonder the Academy totally ignored every aspect of this movie, as it was unworty of any such consideration.<br />I hope that Neo really is dead so nobody tries to revive the franchise and squeeze another $10 out of me.
B00005JL78|5.0|When I first saw Minority Report, I knew I wanted to see it again. I really liked the beginning of the movie. The precogs were, in my opinion, the best characters in the movie, especially the brains of the three of them. If you like action and suspense and if you don't mind a little cursing, I recommend that you buy this movie. If you have young kids, you might want to wait a few years before letting them watch with you.
6305291446|4.0|For being a 7th movie in a horror series, I expected this movie to plain awful, even with Jamie Lee Curtis in it.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br />Halloween H20 was much more than just another movie about kids getting together performing several naughty acts and paying the price for it.  There was actually some plot to it with excellent character development (Curtis &amp; Hartnett), and a fair amount of suspense.<br />Unfortunately, it's impossible to live up the first Halloween.  H20, while a good effort, falls a bit short of the original Halloween in the thrills &amp; chills department.  It just isn't as effective.  But I think the movie is still worth it's weight, and is arguably the 2nd best in the series.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I never saw this movie in theaters. The first time I saw the whole movie was when I was in the hospital. It was a very powerful movie. I thought that the web-slinging was pretty cool. The evil laugh of the Green Goblin was, shall we say, interesting. The DVD version is enhanced, so you can see a lot of interesting stuff that you couldn't see in theaters. For instance, there is a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Spiderman. All things considered, I really recommend that you see this movie. I've already seen it three times and plan to see it many more times.
0783225733|5.0|I am young man, for that I don't know about Apolo activity very much, but in those days in Japan even, I hear that arriving to the moon of Apolo 11 was special things. For instance in Japan the pictures was printed to top article of all newspaper and the live was broadcasted all over Japan.<br />I have thought that a series of  Apolo challenging succeeded, but when I watched this movie, I was very surprised.<br />Certainly because the movie was univers genre, there were difficult technical terms, but the scene that the crews struggled against the accident that broke one after another, the tense situation of NASA and the crews etc, there ware many highlight scene, that is, we can't blink our eyes for the special scene broke one after another.<br />After I watched this movie, I was interested to the universe world even  in addition to Apolo history of NASA. In such meaning, the movie was important for me.<br />Though the comment have been said from old times, arriving to the moon was incredible things and dreaming. I am a little sad because recently NASA don't challenge to landing of other cosmoses including the moon. Certainly many cost will be needed. and their money is tax. That is difficult problem.<br /><br />But challenging is what give dream to us. That is sure.<br />Thank you for reading poor English.
0812932293|5.0|An amazingly fast paced narrative full of adrenaline pumping narratives of corporate rivalry and raw aggressive enterprunal instincts almost all of which came good at almost all the right times interspersed with crazy and ambitious life threatening balloon expeditions. The story of Richard Branson told by Richard Branson almost reads like a bestseller Michael Crichton novel and not an Autobiography. I really was not aware that the virgin group of companies has under it's flagship (can you believe this) 200 companies and all this created just by the positive energy and never say die attitude of a man whose mantra is &quot;anything is worth a shot at least once&quot;. And he really applies this as Branson dabbled his fingers in almost anything and everything so that from the beginnings of a record company virgin music (which he later sold to EMI), he created Virgin Atlantic airways, virgin cars, virgin rails, virgin cola, virgin books, Virgin holidays, Virgin insurance, Virgin cinemas, Virgin wear and even - Virgin Bridal! There are a lot more Virgin companies, which need to total around 200 making up Virgin Group as a whole. I kept glancing at the cover and kept rechecking whether this was an autobiography or a piece of fiction. If some one had even written a novel, which scripted the whole Virgin story, I would have found the plot too unbelievably fairy tallish even if it inhabited a fictional world. Branson is as candid as he can be in this book. Although if he has left out anything, we will never know and don't have the right to know in any case. Also if he presents his viewpoint on the battle against British airways as a righteous crusade painting himself as a hero, he has every right to, as this is his autobiography. The most exciting parts of the book are the balloon expedition narratives and the most suspenseful is the narrative of the crusade against the 'dirty tricks' campaign by lord King of BA (This part is almost like a first rate novel, you'll forget youare reading an autobiography, full of intrigue, corporate skullduggery and potentially damaging but 'untrue and baseless' journalistic exposes planned by some papers against RB albeit with the supposed help of the BA dirty tricks wing.This is the best autobiography I have yet read. Most mainstream bestseller novels will seem dull in comparison to this action packed success story, which actually happened to a person. In fact I would love to read the other side of the story regarding BA and RB. Would be interesting to read a book on BA by someone from BA and how it compares to what RB has to say. After reading this book, I have stuck RB's poster to my cupboard which when I look at immediately inspires me to stay positive and to persist carrying on chugging away at achieving my goals and to laugh off the temporary setback and carry on.
B00000K2SC|5.0|The Matrix is one of the most important films ever made. It speaks to all of us who are struggling to stay awake in on going nightmare. At stake is our free will. The future of mankind is at a pivotal moment. We have the choice to return to the comfort of the womb and pretend that all is okay. Or we can stay awake and risk our destruction. Even before Plato's &quot;Alegory of the Cave&quot; some men and women have been aware of this great struggle. But now the Matrix makes it even more pressing. I love this movie, and its message. I highly recommend it to all thinking people who have felt the splinter in the mind.
060619472X|5.0|don't make the mistake of becomming too hung up about language in this book... it's really the least of your worries. yes there are three phases the main character alex goes through, but plot isn't as important here as internal exposition and dialogue. the point of a clockwork orange is anti-establishmentism. the point is youth culture. the point is... we all grow up, but we're not all going to be drones. if you want to find out about the plot, read someone else's review... if you want to read something of the modern canon, something anti-establishment in the very utmost manner, and if you can handle ultraviolence (if you voted for bush, you should be all set, hah!), you NEED to read this book... it's one of the most important books of the 20th century.
0790729377|5.0|Whether or not you like Elia Kazan as a person--think he's a ..., what have you--his talent for direction is undeniable. And he shows this in the film adaptation of A Streetcar Named Desire. With the same aspect as such films as Wuthering Heights is, it's uncoth, it's dark, it's moody, it's creepy. But with reason. Some things just look better in black + white. To think of this in colour is unspeakable, even. This, along with On the Waterfront, rank as Kazan's best work. Both with Marlon Brando. <br />But dare I speak my mind? As much as I agree Brando is a very talented actour, and that his performance as Stanley Kowalski is excellent, a certain word comes to my mind...overrated? Now, perhaps it's because I prefer more of the traditional acting technique myself over method. Although you're not, in essense, \\"in character\\", it takes a real talent to pull it off. And in a nest of respected, seasoned methods, the one traditional gives, by far, the most outstanding performance. Vivien Leigh as Blanche DuBois is, not only the greatest acting in her career, but quite possibly by any female in the history of cinema. As stated before, she's purely technique. But the eery circumstances surrounding her life at this moment made her Blanche, and not with purpose. Although in a shallow perspective, Blanche is an overdramatic nympho whom many want to slap, I won't let it stop at that. Tennessee Williams remarked on how her Blanche was everything he had intended to bring to the role, and more. This I agree. Having read the play beforehand, and realizing that it would undoubtedly difficult to bring to life, I was persuaded by the 'closing credits' that Viv is one of the greatest actresses in cinematic history, at least to my knowledge. And because of that, she ranks as my most favourite. Above Katharine Hepburn, above Greta Garbo, above Joan Crawford. She can't be surpassed. And perhaps it's becuase I too, oddly enough can sympathize with the character. Sure, I'm not an aging, tormented nyphomaniac-of-a-southern belle, some of it is all to eery. Nothing is greater than the line \\"I've always depended on the kindness of strangers\\". Damn..in a twisted way, it's the hero of the epic tale--one who can surpass all time and place with what they represent. Can't be better.<br />Karl Malden also gives a great performance as Mitch. Having liked him as an actour [and Mitch as a character], I was satisfied with what I watched. I didn't care much for Kim Hunter, although she's not neccesarily bad. The art direction is everything that it should be, and it's Alex North's finest hour. Should've won best picture.<br />Coming from a huge Tennessee Williams fan, this can't be surpassed in terms of film-adaptations of plays. My favourite play, my favourite movie, my favourite actress, and one of my favourite directors. It can't be defeated.
B000002KCC|5.0|Released in 1975 (but recorded in 1973), Tonight's The Night represents the darkest period of Neil Young's career. He was emotionally destroyed and distraught by the overdose deaths of Bruce Berry and Danny Whitten, members of his backing band Crazy Horse and close friends. As such, this album is almost a 180-degree change from the bright, sunny, catchy country tunes showcased on Harvest. I can only imagine the surprise and shock of audiences that attended the Time Fades Away tour to witness Neil transform from a scrubbed pop-country artist backed by Linda Ronstadt into a thoroughly wasted, out-of-tune, ranting madman with an equally out-of-tune band rocking out behind him. The critics and record labels were equally flabbergasted. They all wanted another Top 40 album. Neil told them to shove their expectations, and as a result Tonight's The Night remained out of print for quite some time.<br />While 1974's On The Beach would display a singer/songwriter on the slow path to recovery, here Neil's voice sounds haggard and full of despair while the remains of Crazy Horse shamble on through renditions of bleak barband songs. And that lack of polish and affectation is what totally makes this album. In fact, this may be Neil's best release (in my mind it's tied only with On The Beach). There's no denying the quality of the material here.<br />Tonight's The Night begins with its title track, a smoldering blues burner with Neil behind the piano. Here he directly recounts the rise and fall of his friend Berry:<br />&quot;Bruce Berry was a working man<br />He used to load that Econoline van.<br />A sparkle was in his eye<br />But his life was in his hands.<br />Well, late at night<br />when the people were gone<br />He used to pick up my guitar<br />And sing a song in a shaky voice<br />That was real as the day was long.<br />Early in the mornin'<br />at the break of day<br />He used to sleep<br />until the afternoon.<br />If you never heard him sing<br />I guess you won't too soon.<br />'Cause people let me tell you<br />It sent a chill<br />up and down my spine<br />When I picked up the telephone<br />And heard that he'd died,<br />out on the mainline.&quot;<br />Following that is Speakin' Out, another bluesy tune with a fantastic Nils Lofgren solo. World On A String is a great rocker, while Borrowed Tune is a despairing piano ballad which clips a Rolling Stones melody, and the result hits you squarely in the gut (&quot;I'm singing this borrowed tune/ I took from the Rolling Stones/ Alone in this empty room/ Too wasted to write my own&quot;). Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown, a live artifact from the Filmore East, features the departed Danny Whitten putting in an inspired lead vocal. A fitting lament for a man who was taken far too young.<br />The next two songs, Mellow My Mind and Roll Another Number (For The Road), are so raw and drunken they're hard to listen to the first time. Both read like a epitaph for the previous decade and its free love and innocence.<br />&quot;I'm not goin' back<br />to Woodstock for a while,<br />Though I long to hear that lonesome hippie smile.<br />I'm a million miles away<br />from that helicopter day<br />No, I don't believe<br />I'll be goin' back that way.&quot;<br />Albuquerque is a beautiful traveling ballad that could only come from Neil. Both this and the acoustic poetry of New Mama rank as personal favorites. Lookout Joe is the most rocking track--I've always been a fan of Young's wonderfully rich and imperfect guitar tone, and this song shows why. Tired Eyes is the harrowing tale of a drug deal gone wrong, and another highlight in a series of highlights. Finally, it all ends with a guitar-dominated reprise of the title track that closes the album perfectly.<br />I'm thankful that Neil won out and Tonight's The Night is back in print. It gives us an unflinching glimpse into the mind of an otherwise enigmatic singer/songwriter. It's genuine and unrehearsed, and a million times better than Harvest for it. If you're a Neil fan, you'd better own this.n, you'd better own this.
0385504209|2.0|Much hype is surrounding Dan Brown's latest novel, The Da Vinci Code. It has been on the NY Times Best Sellers' list for months now, and quite frankly, I'm growing a bit weary. Not a day had passed where I could enter a classroom without seeing girls turning the pages of the book. But I ask, why the enthusiasm?<br />If you haven't read this adversity, I suggest you atleast read its predecessor Angels and Demons. It introduces you to the hero himself Robert Langdon. After a comparsion of the two novels, Da Vinci falls flat on its title page. Although a smart business move (which is what we all try to achieve if our aim is to receive an ounce of profit), does it compromise artistic integrity? Brown has found a niche for himself and he seems to capitalize it. Perhaps it'll gain you attention for the next piece you publish, but he's in the process of writing yet another with Langdon. Gimmicky? Appears so to me. Where as Angels had the suspense and the intelligence, Da Vinci barely touches the bar raised by it's mother book.<br />I suppose it could possibly be the setting, the time frame Langdon is given in the two novels--and the dire consequence. Whereas he has a tenuous 10-some hours to save the Vatican from explosion--that's Botticelli, Raphael, Michaelangelo, Bernini all being shatterned to fragments before our very eyes--he isn't faced with the same plight in Da Vinci. I've found that with each page I am engorged in useless tidbits of relgious + art history, Da Vinci only provided me the knowledge of the hand in Last Supper. I was never the Leonardo fan myself, as I preferred Raphael and of course Botticelli, so perhaps some bias is relevant. However, the abeyance of Angels is what keeps the reader's interest, and it's sadly missed in Da Vinci.<br />If you haven't read Angels + Demons and had been planning on reading The Da Vinci Code--and you do not wish to be spoiled by Dan Brown's intelligent, although a bit limiting move--then by all means, read The Da Vinci Code. But if your goal is to read a book laden with stimulating, purchase the previous. Your wallet will thank you.Code. But if your goal is to read a book laden with stimulating, purchase the previous.

0385504209|3.0|As this product of &quot;breaking the mold&quot; new generation style of writing has stayed so long on the best seller list, it must have given pleasure to enough holiday makers and switch-offers. It is a good read as entertainment and is full of interesting stuff about the Vatican and Opus Dei that rings true, however further analysis leaves the intelligent reader frustrated by naivity of the details (the mirror writing is so obvious) and other points of fact are inexcusable and should have been checked on the web before publication.<br />There are so many solicisms to list, starting with his idiotic ideas about customs regulations. Then, even before terrorism  changed the rules, no car, not even a &quot;Jaguar stretch limo with smoked windows and whitewall tires&quot; would get near to parking on Horse Guards Parade for more that the time it takes to tow it away. If I remember my Westminster Abbey correctly, the Chapter House is entered from the East Cloister and has no possible view of College Garden. Because it comes under the Department of the Environment you have to pay to get in. It has a famous medieval tiled floor, not a stone one, and felt slippers are issued to the public. St Faith's Chapel is off the South Transept, not the Cloisters and his other topographical descriptions are rubbish. There is no brass rubbing permitted except in the Cloisters.<br />These sort of factual mistakes are unforgiveable as they take the reader's mind of the main theme of the book and make one wonder how many similar mistakes are there in the Paris scenario. I made a list of several other minor factual errors before getting bored making it.<br />The idea behind the book is a good one as is the plot. We all know how Church history has been massaged and like to read about it. Perhaps he can now do a sequel about Islam! If Don Brown has made enough money out of this, perhaps next time he can employ a couple of research assistants to keep him on the straight and narrow.

0312995423|5.0|I don't understand why people are panning this book.  I thought it was great.  Far better than Deception Point and I actually enjoyed it more than Da Vinci Code.

0385336810|4.0|Believing she is about to perish in a plane wreck, Emma Corrigan babbles out her secrets, desires and idiosyncrasies to the handsome and reassuring man seated next to her. Having survived (Emma, with her own jangled mind, was doubtful of this), she shows up for work the next day only to be introduced to that seatmate. He's the CEO of the U.S.-based Panther Cola she's been marketing.<br />As she tries to recover her professional stature with her boss Emma finds herself enmeshed in a tangled web of her own weaving as she tries to get to know more about Jack. It should be noted that Emma has considerable help at her crazy loom from her flatmates Lissy and Jemima. At the same time Jack is trying to get to know Emma, but his thoughts are more business-based than romance-based. Emma to him is a fine marketing specimen of a young working woman in her twenties. This part of the plot wears thin.<br />The early chapters, in which Emma's flight from Glasgow begins a precipitous plunge and she begins her ill-considered true confessions, are quite engaging and spring out of a genuinely sympathetic perspective: so many people are prone to chatter when in shock. And the comic element of having Emma's business-class seatmate wind up being her boss is classic stuff.<br />But Jack's &quot;betrayal&quot; of Emma does not seem genuine. Perhaps it's a cultural divide, but it's difficult to believe that any television show, even one on &quot;Business Inspirations,&quot; would allow a CEO to go on and on about the tiny details Jack reveals, from Emma's Barbie bedspread to her borrowing her roommate's shoes (not to mention the other information about her roommate --- mortification alert!) Jack uses the elements of Emma's character that have made her so believable as a business ploy --- but what ensues feels like forced farce.<br />Kinsella previously gave us the light, bright and laugh-out-loud funny Shopaholic books (CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC, SHOPAHOLIC TAKES MANHATTAN and SHOPAHOLIC TIES THE KNOT). Kinsella's &quot;shopaholic,&quot; Becky Bloomwood, is a fictional descendant of both Thackeray's Becky Sharp and Austen's Emma Woodhouse, living by her wits but also living for others (in Becky Bloomwood's case, the suave Luke). She is known as one of the quintessential Chick Lit characters along with Bridget Jones and the Nanny Diaries nanny. Those books set a really high bar. Those books were really funny; this new one is just fun. However, one has to think if the writer were not Kinsella would we be judging CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET in the same way? And there are times where just fun is just fine.<br />One thing we know.

0060922583|5.0|Talbot has created a great book. The Holographic Universe is a discourse on a new way (paradigm) for viewing life and the Universe, based primarily on revelations from quantum physics. While my copy is over 10 years old, and physics has moved forward a bit since then, most of the material in the book is as revelant today as it was when my copy was published in 1991.<br />The basic premise of the book concerns the nature of holography, and how the Universe and our existence and experience can be viewed through a holographic model. For those who don't know, a holgram or holograph is a photographic image created by splitting a laser beam and recording interference patterns between the two beams after one has been reflected off the subject to be photographed. It has the remarkable property of containing the entire image on each piece if you cut it or break it into smaller pieces. This idea of the whole contained in each piece is the basis of the Holographic principle. It has been found to be very useful in explaining the behavior of many natural systems, hence the purpose of this book.<br />Talbot discusses many areas of life, including particle physics and physical health. He quotes and cites authorities like Bohm, Grof, Pribram, and many others too numerous to mention here. The book is an incredible resource for a new view of reality as well as a huge listing of people, books, and research to go into more depth on the subjects covered. It is one of my favorite books, and I have given more than one away as a gift. At one time, I kept two additional copies just to loan out.<br />My favorite parts of the book are the experiment in mass dreams near the end, and the section starting on page 90 dealing with the placebo effect and Multiple Personality Disorder(MPD). The fact that placebo effect can cure illness at a higher rate than many pharmaceuticals should make people sit up and take notice. If that doesn't wake you up, then the research on the health capabilities of people with MPD ought to really rattle your sense of reality darned hard. <br />The fact that people with MPD can turn illnesses on and off totally destroys the whole Cartesian-clockwork view of physical reality, not to mention the Western allopathic model of medicine. These people can experience radical changes in their biology just by changing which personality is \\"in charge\\" of the body. I'm talking total disappearance of diabetes, complete changes in vision (color blindness as well as refractive errors), allergic reactions, erasing the effects of drugs and alcohol; tumors, scars, and cysts coming and going, and more. All of these things are well-documented in the scientific literature (cited in the book). I personally know of a case (not in the book) of a broken bone that would not show on x-rays unless the personality who broke the bone was present! The person who recounted this to me was very much frightened by it, and reluctantly revealed it only when I raved about this sction of the book.<br />The MPD research alone should force a total redirection of our health research. Of course it won't, because trillion-dollar industries rely on expensive cures that don't necessarily work, and those industries couldn't care less about your and my health, only our ability to pay.<br />This book is a terrific read and will open your eyes to wonderful new things. It may even open you up to a whole new life, it is that powerful. It is still vital after a decade, and well worth reading. A no-holds-barred 5.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I really wanted to like this album, but...<br />1)Some of the music is ripped off wholesale from Metallica and Megadeth.<br />2)Some of the music is ripper off from their old songs<br />3)The songs sounded like they were hacked together as quickly as possible, which probably caused the two problems listed above. After reading the other reviews, I'm guessing this is because the album was written in only 3 weeks. I'm actually surprised. I would have guessed it was written in 3 days.<br />4)There only seems to be one style on the album: play heavy. There is little to no variety and most the songs sound surprisingly similar.<br />5)All of their other albums were far better, even the bad ones.<br />6)After listening to it, I felt like I'd bought a used car with no engine.
B00000K19E|4.0|This movie is five years old now. It has spawned two sequels, and the Animatrix, and by the middle of 2002, the famous &quot;Bullet Time&quot; sequence had been spoofed in over 20 different movies. So to say the whole design of the movie is getting a little tedious now is an understatement now. The movie was revolutionary when it first started out, but now so many people have 'copied' the Wachowski brothers ideas, it's just not so great a film anymore. Well, the film is great, if very much about the talk rather than the action.<br />Matrix Revolutions has just come out on DVD. After the Matrix, Reloaded and Revolutions had a lot to live up to, and got absolutely slated in the press. I've been reading reviews for the DVD of Revolutions, and some of them have been very misleading - particularly one, which said it had no DVD extras. A sure sign of a reviewer not being able to be bothered to check out their facts first, when in fact, it's a 2-disc set, with a lot of extras.<br />Anyway, I just wanted to have a small rant about that :) before continuing. I have to rant to someone.<br />There's a lot of hard work put into the filming of the Matrix, as you can see just by watching it. Before filming, the main actors spent time with martial arts experts learning the fight movies, from October 1997-March 1998. Funnily enough, the actors thought originally this would only take a few weeks! Carrie Anne Moss was so afraid that she would get recast when she twisted her ankle, that she kept it quiet, which must have been extemely difficult!<br />There are many references that the Wachowski brothers have included in this, from comic books, to movies, to people! There are quite a few references to Alice In Wonderland; the traitor is called Reagan, and wants to become someone important and remember nothing when he leaves the Matrix, which could refer to former US President Ronald Reagan; when Neo is in the elevator to go and see the Oracle, he can see KYM carved into the wall, which refers to Kym Barrett, a costumer designer; and Neo's room number is 101 and Room 101 was the place in George Orwell's book &quot;1984&quot; where people were sent to be tortured and would end up believing something that wasn't true. (!)<br />Apparently, principal photography wrapped at 1:01am with the scene where the characters are inside the wall, climbing down. Principal photography took 25 weeks/118 days.<br />Before the Matrix, Keanu Reeves hadn't really had a major box office hit since maybe Speed in 1994. And there were a couple of good films inbetween that didn't get the recognition they deserved! :) But the Matrix trilogy has really propelled him to stardom, but no doubt, he'll leave it all behind now, and do some more 'bad' films.<br />I suppose everyone will always say this is the best of the trilogy. But once you have the first, you have to get the rest just to complete the trilogy. It's ridiculous to have 2 out of 3, or 1 of 3. The bit I hate about the whole movie, is the use of guns. They're overly used, and overall, guns are way overused in movies these days. But that's just my opinion.refers to Kym Barrett, a costumer designer; and Neo's room number is 101 and Room 101 was the place in George Orwell's book &quot;1984&quot; where people were sent to be tortured and would end up believing something that wasn't true.

0783229364|4.0|A fairly strong recommendation for a charming feel-good entertainer about a young gun making it to the top, starting of course from the mail roon. We might as well have called it &quot;The secret of how I succeeded without really trying&quot;. The script is thus obviously doozy and relies on some major implausible situational gaffes, but the energy of Michael Fox and the brilliant comic timing of Margaret Whitton as his aunt makes it all borderline credible.  Plus, the snappy final half hour is the best part of the film, with some thoughtful romance thrown in for good measure. I guess we all have a hint of Bradley (Fox' character) buried in ourselves. A fun rental to lighten things up.
B00005B0PU|5.0|The British 1960's band the Zombies seemed to have all what it took to be a success. Two unsually gifted songwiters in Rod Argent and Chris White and two outstanding singers, Colin Blunstone and Rod Argent (again).  What they may have lacked was a little more \\"edge\\" to balance their melodic music and \\"nice school-boys\\" image.<br /><br /> They actually did have early success with their 1964 single \\"She's Not There\\". But in spite of several strong singles were recorded and released during 1965-66, they somehow were not able to follow-up their early success.<br /><br />So in early 1967 the band had not had a hit-record for more than two years, and it seemed that their time was over. They decided to record a final \\"real\\" album before they'd split up. The result was the highly acclaimed \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" which they recorded during the second half of 1967.<br /><br />Of course they had hoped that one of the two first singles taken from these recordings \\"Friends of Mine\\" and \\"Care of Cell 44\\" would bring them back into the charts. And since this did not happen they assumed their time was over, so they disbanded  before the album was actually released in April 1968.<br /><br />Another single was chosen to promote the album, and the succeeding big success of \\"Time of the Season\\" in America came as a complete surprise. The album itself also reached the lower parts of the charts in the States.<br /><br />Their music has proving its viability over the years, and this album contains some of their finest moments, with great tunes from both Argent and White.<br /><br />After their unexpected 1968 \\"comeback\\" effort were made to secure a Zombies re-union. But Rod Argent and Chris White were already deeply involved in gathering a new band, which eventually would become \\"Argent\\".<br /><br />In this transition period Argent and White were persuaded to do a final \\"Zombies\\" album which was given the title \\"R.I.P.\\"<br /><br />The album was supposed to consist of earlier out-takes and demos, ( with new overdubbings ) combined with new recordings.<br /><br />This 12-songs \\"new\\" album was for release some time in 1969 but the album which had been given the title \\"R.I.P.\\" was never released.<br /><br />This was a big shame, as it would have been a great album.<br /><br />In recent years this album has actually been released in Japan and all songs have been released released on various compilations. Here among the bonus-tracks you'll 11 of these songs of which most equals on the actual album.  The box-set \\"Zombie Heaven\\" contains all 12 songs.<br /><br />6 of these \\"R.I.P.\\" songs are original Zombies recordings from 1964-66, featuring Colin Blustone on vocals. He was called in to record new vocals to \\"Walking in the Sun\\" which is the earliest track, from late 1964, but he is not involved in any of the \\"new\\" 1968 recordings. Rod Argent, who is also an incredibly fine singer, takes over the vocals on these tracks. All these 1968 songs / recordings are great. \\"Imagine the Swan\\", \\"Smokey Day\\", \\"Girl Help Me\\", \\"I Could Spend the Day\\" are outstanding songs. \\"Imagine the Swan\\" was released as a single and was a minor hit in America.<br /><br />The earlier recordings featuring Colin Blunstone are equally strong. \\"If It Don't Work Out\\" was written for Dusty Springfield in 1965.

The song was also released as the Zombies' final single in July 1969.    So apart from the one missing song ( \\"I'll Keep Trying\\" ) this highly recommed CD contains two great Zombies albums.
6305537798|5.0|I love this movie!!!! I've seen it many many times and never get tired of it!!!! It is one of my two favorite movies!!!!
B00005JLYW|1.0|This was quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen.  After watching nearly 20 minutes of pure crap I was forced to turn it off.  I don't understand how anyone can be stupid enough to derive entertainment from this.  It seemed more like a randomn rush of trendy images than a coherent film.  The movie jumped from one idiotic scene to the next.  Please don't waste your money on this.
B00005JMSE|3.0|This was a very enjoyable film and should spawn a sequel or two.  The only question is, since this is one of those \\"save the world\\" films, what do you do for an encore?<br />Ron Perlman was excellent as the blue collar hero.  But rather than be a simple caricature, we saw Hellboy's deep feelings emerge for one of his fellow teammates, whose powers resemble those of an X-Men 2 mutant.  The scene with him spying on her from a rooftop while she was on a date was really funny and somewhat tender at the same time.<br />The mysterious Nazi in the \\"gas mask\\" is revealed eventually and he slices and dices his way through the film like a martial arts expect with nunchak-like steel blades.  The CGI monster looks like a cross between a squid, a warthog and a wolf.  There's proof that this film doesn't try to take itself too seriously when Hellboy battles one of these creatures with one hand while holding onto a box of kittens in the other.  The comment he makes will crack you up.<br />At times, the story is a bit convuluted and would require a second viewing to follow closely.<br />Hellboy is a new cinema icon and so long as Perlman is able to play the role with humour and human feelings, much like Tobey McGuire's Spiderman, we have the makings of a franchise.  It's not as superb as the last X-Men film but Hellboy the chracter is much more charismatic that the Hulk, Daredevil or any of the cast from The Leagure of Extraordinarly Gentlemen.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|A classic reborn. One of the greatest hip hop albums ever is reincarnated and remastered. The original tight as* tracks brought back 2 life. I also like the remixes cuz they make it easier 4 the younger generation 2 digest the complexities of nas's poetry. The only thing is it would have been better if they used primo n the other original producers 2 do the remixes themselves plus they should of had the original remixes on it. On the real 2004 is hot even though I like the original feat. Coremega and etc.(I don't remember who else was on it) more. Finally Star Wars is an ill track re establishing the fact that he had shown on stillmatic and godson that Nas is back. Over all this is a most have 4 all Hip Hop heads, Poetry heads, Rap heads, every music lover in general. Peace 1 luv
B000001FHV|5.0|Strong sets of musicianship and songwriting makes this my favorite Puppet album after the big two [MP II and Up on the Sun]. These are certainly as tuneful a set of songs as the Puppets have ever recorded.<br />They've never really gotten the recognition they deserved and while they've made a few spotty albums this isn't one of them. From Violet Eyes to the excellent Severed Goddess Hand most of the songs here are excellent and have held up well over the last few years.<br />\\"Too High to Die\\" doesn't quite achieve the heights of II and Up on the Sun, but that's not a criticism. Few albums from any artists hold up well in comparasion with those two albums.<br />This is a great album and one of the best alternative albums of the '90s.
0385510438|4.0|First of all, let me state the obvious, so that any potential reader of this novel will have a good chance of grasping what he is (or is not) dealing with: The Last Juror, John Grisham's latest legal novel, is very good, but it's not like The Firm. This point is so important that at the risk of insulting your intelligence, I'm going to say it again: THE LAST JUROR IS VERY GOOD, BUT IT'S NOT THE FIRM!!! Most fans of Grisham love what I'm going to call &quot;the Grisham formula&quot;: taut, edgy, plot; vividly drawn, but memorable characters; a fantasy situation guaranteed to keep them on the edge of their seats, fabulous, mouthwatering scenes of fattening Southern-style feasts (very much in the manner of James Bond author Ian Fleming), somewhat leftist politics, and finally, the young and (usually) male leading character sailing off into the sunset (usually the Carribean) with fistfuls of cash and plenty of time on his hands. So what's different about The Last Juror? The hero, 23-year old aspiring journalist-turned newspaper-owner Willie Traylor, who borrows money from his wealthy grandmother to buy The Ford County Times and save it from bankuptcy? Nope. The fascinating, larger than life characters, like something from the Italian Commedia D'ell Arte stock shows? Nope. The last juror herself, Calia Ruffin, the imposing, yet soft-hearted matriarch of Clanton's most successful black family, is one of the most luminous characters Grisham has ever created, and the southern soul feasts she prepares are certainly juicy enough to set any reader's mouth watering. The chance for the hero to make lots of money? Nope, this happens as well, as Traynor makes the Times a phenomenal success, enough to entertain a very lucrative buyout offer. The politics? Not there either, as Grisham takes a very thinly-veiled (and VERY dated) jab at the Wal Mart chain, and opposes the war in Vietnam. No, it seems the primary reason that many fans of &quot;The Formula&quot; will feel cheated by theLast Juror is the fact that the (mostly) excellent plot is hurredly jammed into about 100 or so of the books 350+ pages. Danny Padgett, scion of a very corrupt local family, brutally rapes and murders a young single mother, is sentenced to life in prison instead of receiving the death penalty, vows revenge on all the jurors, and is parolled after just serving ten years. However, the majority of the book does not concern the plot, but instead focuses on the character of Willie Traynor and how he grows from a wet-behind-the-ears college kid into a responsible adult. Thus, the story of this book has more in common with the relaxed tone of Bleachers or perhaps A Painted House rather than the edgy, frenetic pace of The Firm or A Time To Kill (which was also set in Clanton). Grisham is still growing and improving as a writer as he ages, therefore he simply cannot write the exact same type of books as he wrote fifteen years ago; there are important, mature changes in pace and time, and for the most part, the changes work, particularly in the scenes involving Miss Callie and her lovely brood of children-turned-college professors. The scenes with lawyer Harry Rex are also excellent for comic relief and Willie's goal of visiting every church in town provides a wonderfully unexpected subplot. Still, for such a relaxed pace, the ending feels very rushed and the reader almost feels cheated out of a proper denoument; Grisham could have taken another dozen or so pages and made a much smoother ending, this one feels as if it were written on deadline. (For that matter, a personal gripe: Where, oh where, is The Grisham Female, that delicious blend of sass, smarts, and sophistication notably absent from the last few novels. Think Darby Shaw, Ellen Roark, or Gabrielle from The Runaway Jury, and you get the idea. Ginger, the female love intrest in this book, appears in a mere dozen pages.) Still, the resolute, compassionate character of Miss Callie is worth the price of the book alone;this black-white, mother-son-like relationship will warm your heart and the plot, though rushed, does end in a nice twist. Get The Last Juror, for while it's not A Time To Kill, or even The Rainmaker, it's delights are very real and certainly firm enough for many readers, even if the plot seems a bit too flimsy for devotees of the famous &quot;Grisham Formula&quot;.
B000059XUO|5.0|EXICTING,THRILLER AND TWO THUMBS WAY UP!! TO THIS MOVIE! AS I remember (when i first saw this &quot;film&quot; back in 1996 i wasn't REALLy into it) And so i didn't pay much attention, the fact being known that &quot;brandon lee&quot; was in the movie made it worth watching, because of his Dad's past/career and martial art movies. Basically now that i've seen it a couple of weeks ago I have really gotten into the movie and everything, plus the fact my b-day is on halloween (makes obivously to me):)that i like these kinds of movies and of coarse &quot;Martial Arts&quot; Nonetheless,<BR>BUT MOVIE IS A ASTONISHING CINEMA WITH GREAT CHARACTORS AND ROLES AND EVERYTHING WAS SET-UP ALMOST PERFECT, EUPHORIC MUSIC AND THIS MOVIE IS A 5star and is in fact worth watching with friends or girl-friend (recommended) <br />Oh by the way....Eric (Brandon Lee) mentioned in the movie. <BR>{&gt;&quot;*~it's funny, because I thought all the small things that Shelly did was trivial~*&quot;&lt;}
B00001QEE7|5.0|I just got a copy of this movie I bought from We Ship Daily here on Amazon. It was a great copy, mint used, but at least it played perfect. Even though I forked over twenty-seven dollars for it I'm not complaining. I am happy to have it considering what some sellers are charging and it looks like we may not see it on DVD again for a few years. This is by far one of Disney's best movies. I buy just about all of their movies including the older family movies like Swiss Family Robinson. I would have to say this rates in the top three of their musical animated movies. The whole family should like it. I'm sure girls/women might enjoy it the most since Ariel is a very independent lady.
B000089RVX|4.0|I'm bad at headers, please forgive me.<br /> Evanescence was arguably the biggest breakout band of 2003. Now they're sold-out hitmakers that are loved by gothic teenagers, middle-aged women and music critics alike. (I'm naming these from personal experiences) ..now how does Evanescence measure up?<br /> You've already heard the most worthy songs on the CD. &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; &quot;Going Under&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; are the three best songs on the CD, so if you expect a CD full of beautiful &quot;My Immortals&quot; please search elsewhere.<br /> The rest of the CD is woven with pretty much alternating faster and slower songs. As far as standouts go? Aside from the singles, we also have &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; which is lacking in lyrics but makes up for that in melody, and &quot;Torniquet&quot; which is full circle above-average but nothing spectacular. For lyrical depth, try &quot;Hello&quot; ..<br /> Amy Lee's voice is tolerable at worst. Her fashion sense may be a bit off-key, but her voice remains lovely and distinctive, and always matches the background (or vice versa, who knows where manufacturing may be lurking..?)<br /> If no one you know is buying this CD, you A) Live in a Ghost Town or B) Know nobody!..<BR> This album remains in the top 5 on the album charts after a year of being on it, selling upwards of 100,000 a week. Nice, right? One of those customers includes my lovely mother. Way to go Mom, you saved me fifteen bucks. <br /> I enjoyed it. It's worthy of removing forty minutes of your life.<br /> BOTTOM LINE: Good. Something everyone would enjoy.<BR> GRADE: A-
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I am surprised as to how much I like many of the songs on this CD, and although I give it three stars, those stars are well earned.<br />What I liked:<br />1) Lindsey Buckingham's amazing production. This is a man who obsesses over this process and the results are well worth it as the sound is crisp and innovative BUT does not make the mistake of trying to &quot;update&quot; the Fleetwood Mac sound to reflect current production bells and whistles. Any bells are strictly Lindsey's and he has gotten better with time.<br />2) Many of the songs are really great. I partularly liked selections 1,3,4,6,7,12 (I love thing song!), 13, and 18.<br />3) Both Stevie and Lindsay sound great, and I have the feeling that Stevie is on a growth curve that will bring her to even higher highs than she has ever enjoyed.<br />4) All in all, it's really great to listen to a group that you grew up with sound so great and not have become a case of warhorses trying to make a buck off the past. This is a relevant release and not the product of nostalgia.<br />What I disliked:<br />1) Some heavy-metalish guitar work on several songs that does not fit in AT ALL within the context of many songs, especially in the latter part of the CD. &quot;Come&quot; is an example of this.<br />2) The CD is way too long and some songs should have been kept off the release to make it more tight. Of course you can make your own mix with less songs, which I did.<br />3) I was never a hard-core fan of Christine McVie's songs, but not having her play a big role in the release shows what an integral part of the group she is. Her harmonies are greatly missed and I never appreciated her contribution as much as I should have.<br />4) Some reviewers have pointed out that this feels in many respects like Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham solo releases combined into one product. I agree with this and although it's not a huge problem, one wonders what Christine McVie and stronger input from Mick and John would have brought to the product as it is lacking some cohesiveness.<br />So after all this three stars may seem stingy, but like I said they are a well earned three stars that could have been 4 by taking out the lesser songs and focusing on the cream of the crop.ht to the product as it is lacking some cohesiveness.<br />So after all this three stars may seem stingy, but like I said they are a well earned three stars that could have been 4 by taking out the lesser songs and focusing on the cream of the crop.
B000002MY3|4.0|After 9 years of meaning to pick up this cd I got it lastweek and well it's every bit as good as I knew it would be. The best songs on this album are, in my opinion,&quot;right through you&quot; &quot;you oughta know&quot; and &quot;mary jane&quot;. I relate to those ones so that's why I love em. Although I enjoy &quot;SFIJ&quot; far more, this one is also highly enjoyable, I personally like the enlightened Alanis better! But it's all good!!
B000025WWO|5.0|These are among the best Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto performances. Lylia Zilberstein is a very disciplined and fast player. Claudio Abbado does a great job with the Berlin philarmonique. I have heard different pianists playing Rachmaninov's Piano Concertos, but Lylia in this recording is absolutely awesome. In the Third Piano Concerto, she opted to play the &quot;quicksilver&quot; version for the cadenza in the first movement, rather than the heavily chordial and full-blooded one (although the latter sounds fantastic played by other pianists as well). She plays it very fast without missing any notes! Sometimes it seems that the philarmonique needs to catch Lylia's speed, though her fast performance does not compromise the beautiful and sweet rhythmic Piano Concertos' passages at all.<br />The recording sound is remarkably neat and the piano sound is really sharp!<br />This is really a worhwhile CD purchase.
B0001ENY6M|4.0|In order to appreciate the score to \\"Passion\\", it is important to understand that the soundtrack was never meant to be a powerful, stand-alone work.  It has been compared to Peter Gabriel's \\"Passion\\" for good reason.  The two soundtracks tackle very similar thematic intent, and use very similar musical concepts and techniques in their creation, but they serve very different purposes.<br />Peter Gabriel's music was truly groundbreaking work.  The styles and concepts Peter used were new and unique and started an entire trend towards world music.  The soundtrack absolutely stands alone, and one could spend endless hours listening to the different cadences and time signatures and scales, getting lost in the music.  I am sure that was Peter's intent.  He intended to create the best album he could and he was an unquestionable success.  <br />Debney's score is not groundbreaking, stand alone work, because Debney consciously and purposely created a score that would be subordinate to the film.  It is background filler, designed to enhance the story, not overshadow it.  \\"Temptation\\" is not even in the same league as \\"Passion\\".  Where \\"Last Temptation\\" was primarily a movie to convey an alternative idea about Christ, \\"Passion\\" tackles the core spirituality of Christ Himself.  Whether or not the viewer is deeply religious, Gibson made an intensely spiritual film where Scorsese did not.  Gibson could not afford to have the audience distracted by a remarkable score.  He could not afford to have an audience distracted by radical tonal scales during, for example, the Crucifixion.<br />So I believe as part of the overall film, Debney's score is an unqualified success, in that it totally fulfills the director's and composer's intent.  However, this is not a review of the movie, it is a review of the score itself.  Some will relive the movie when listening to the score, or use it to enhance their devotional experience (as one reviewer said) and for them this score will be a solid 5 stars.  Others will try to examine the music on its own merit and will probably be disappointed, comparing it to Peter Gabriel's superior work.  However, I believe if you understand the intent of the music, you will not be disappointed.

0446613444|4.0|I've been looking for this novel, you see. It's about a well adjusted and highly effective police detective, on the fast track, who is loved by all the brass and has a nice family waiting at home for him every night.  This detective is given a lot of support by the investigative apparatus and has developed a nice working relationship with the press. He works cases methodically and practically, never making himself the target of some psycho. Well, I haven't found it yet, but one thing I can tell you is Harry Bosch is not that detective and The Black Ice is definitely not that book. Michael Connelly has developed the stereotypical me against the world cop book that comes off as anything but stereotypical. In this latest police procedural, the procedure are all thrown out the window as Bosch tries to solve the murder of a fellow policeman that no one seems to want solved. Tied in with the death of narcotic's officer Cal Moore's demise, is a few drug related killers and the recent sudden retirement of a fellow homicide detective. Connelly spins a web of corruption and lost youth, symbolically weaving together the tough childhood's of the slain detective and Bosch and takes the tale south of LA, to twin Mexican Border Towns and a ring of smugglers transporting the latest hip drug, Black Ice.<BR>         <BR>     While this may not have been a great novel, Connelly does a great job with the subtle symbolism in this book. He doesn't need to hit you over the head with it and he gives the reader a lot of credit for intelligence. But then it all breaks down in the end after the obligatory action scenes, Bosch takes a turn as Hercule Poirot, and needs to explain everything down to the last detail to an ungrateful boss. For the most part this was a brisk paced and fun addition to the Harry Bosch series.
B0001CNRS4|5.0|I was a little sceptical about this movie, but decided to give it a try. It turned out to be surprisingly good. The movie is nice and uplifting, with a good ending. There is a lot of singing and dancing going on, hip-hop stuff. I enjoyed watching it. Go for it!
B00005JMEW|4.0|I found it interesting that Tarantino decided to tell part of this story in animated form. For a nice segment of this developing story of a bride, seemingly struck down on her wedding day, now out for revenge, Tarantino tells the story in traditional Japanese animation form, with plenty of blood and gore and outrageousness. Why I find this interesting is that the ensuing live action scenes are just as cartoonish as the animated scenes. Tarantino tells an outrageous story, using outrageous images in an incredible comic way that underscores the ultraviolent themes. When the bride attacks swiftly with her razor sharp blade separating man from limb the ensuing blood loss seems as realistic as Wile E. Coyote getting hit in the head with an anvil. Even the basic sceneries and colorings of the various sets and settings are cartoonish. Now, this isn't a criticism. Tarantino uses this format purposefully and brilliantly. His characters don;t seem too realistic, but that's fine because this isn't a tale of realism, this is as much a fantasy as the world of Middle Earth.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|If you were to just happen upon this movie in the DVD rental shop and pick it up because the little blurb on the back intrigued you then at the end of this movie you would be pleasently surprised. However, unless you've been under a rock you've heard all the hype: Oscar nods for leads Scarlett Johansson & Bill Murray, and Writer/Director Sofia Coppola (who won the Oscar for best original screenplay). Thus overwhelmed or at least tainted by the hype you'll likely say to yourself or anyone else in the room at the end of this film: \\"What the? That movie sucked!\\"<br />The Good: Scarlett Johansson & Bill Murray are fun to watch together. It's almost like watching the real Murray try to amuse himself in Tokyo. Coppola really does a good job handling the real star of the film: TOKYO! This film couldn't, wouldn't exist in any other setting. Murray & Johansson partake in a feww experiences truly unique to Tokyo and Coppola, who is on record as having spent A LOT of time there, captures it beautifully. From the crowded trains, to the Shibuya shopping, to the small restaurants & karaoke bars--Coppola gives Tokyo a feel of wonderment and warmth while maintaining the uneasiness any Westerner feels when they first visit Tokyo.<br />The Bad: This is not a Hollywood love story. No answered questions or traditional characters. I liked this about the film, but a lot of people I talked to found this to be too much for them. Yes the pace is slow, and I feel there should've been a bit more comedy with Murray and his fish out of water experiences with Japanese culture. Another thing is Coppola missed so much stuff about Tokyo and Japan! Having lived in Tokyo myself, I felt she only hit the tip of the iceberg. Most of this was because her main characters were rich and pampered entertainment types (something Coppola undoubtedly related to) so they missed out on a lot of \\"normal\\" Tokyo experiences that occur outside the 5 star hotel circle..<br />The DVD: Great behind the scenes footage from Coppola's then husband, Spike Jonze. All too brief \\"interview\\" w/ Murray & Coppola. Sadly no commentary from ANYONE! I'd love to hear some of Coppola's real life stories from her time in Tokyo as well as any similar experiences Murray & Johansson might've had in Japan with their characters. No deleted scenes. No outtakes.<br />Bottomline: If you don't buy into the hype and watch the film with an open mind you won't be dissapointed.
0790731924|5.0|My all time favorite action movie.  Nothing else even comes close in terms of action and comedy.  Gibson and Glover are outrageous as goofball cops Riggs and Murtaugh and Joe Pesci adds another element of wackiness.  Tremendous action also.....a must see!!!.  Go get it!!!

185984054X|2.0|There truly is no limit to the hatred of some. Attacking a person who dedicated her entire life to helping others truly illustrates how dedicated these individuals are to uprooting the values on which American society have stood for hundreds of years. Not to mention that such individuals and their groups will stop at nothing attack all that is good. It is ironic that people who have done nothing more in their lives than read a simple book and write a critique criticize and even condemn a literal saint who dedicated her entire life to helping others. To those of you who wrote the &quot;book reviews&quot; viciously attacking Mother Theresa: what have you done with your life? <BR>And one more thing: when you write a &quot;review,&quot; try actually reviewing the book, and leave your propaganda at home.

B00003CXC7|5.0|Undoubtedly one of the greatest movies he ever made, Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterwork &quot;Rear Window&quot; has certainly stood the test of times, and with good reason. Every little second of the film is to die for, from the opening credits to the long and breathtaking closeup of Grace Kelly to its breakneck conclusion, it's hard not to love it.<br />When photographer J.B. &quot;Jeff&quot; Jeffries, played by Jimmy Stewart in one of his finest roles ever, breaks his leg, he is confined to his Greenwich Village apartment room and becomes fixated with the lives of his neighbors across the way from him. He soon expects that a mysterious salesman (played vigorously by Raymond Burr) may have murdered his annoying wife, he decides to do a little investigating - with the help of his gorgeous girlfriend Lisa Freemont (played by Grace Kelly in her finest role ever). It all leads up to a shocking conclusion that will linger in yout mind long after the end credits.<br />If you're a Hitchcok fan or just love movies, &quot;Rear Window&quot; will surely satisfy. I promise.
B0000027RL|1.0|terrible album! Beats are boring and the music just plain sucks and these guys have to be some of the ugliest guys in the music industry. i should take a star away from them just being UGLY. get better rock cds instead.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Ok honestly i love APC, this however does NOT mean by any chance that my review will be biased at ALL. I have followed Maynard (lead vocalist for tool and APC) through his Tool albums all the way to thirteenth step meaning i can pretty much pick out any song of tools or APC's by sound alone. sounds geeky huh? maybe a little but hears a song by song rundown.<br />1. The Package- Very well...different, the intense structure rattling base moves at a slow melodic pace, the guitars bring some extra life to the song but still theres not much energy to begin with until it explodes at the end. An amazing song with inceredibel lyrics and Maynard puts them together perfectly, honestly i think i like the background more here though.<BR>5/5<BR>2. Weak and Powerless- a very energetic song, somewhat sad, a very good song but somewhat overplayed on the internet. Not sure what its about (drug addiction i believe), but the musical score here is pretty fast and energetic yet in a soft innocent why leaving u feeling satisfied but not violent. Seems over fast though<BR>4/5<BR>3. The Noose- quite [possibly my favorite song on the album, the vocals are INCREDIBLE, soft and soothing yet they carry an undeniably controlled anger in them. the way in which this song flows is just amazing, and the very light background noise is like taking a bath.<BR>5/5<BR>4. Blue- a good track, but does not quite stand up to the other tracks on the album. The opening lyrics are deep and give u a good view on certain things while throughout the whole song it has a soft yet at the same time enrgetic feel to it. the lyrics seem a little sloppy at parts but not nearly enough to ruin the song.<BR>3/5<BR>5. Vanishing- Vanishing is a hard song to rate, it seems as though its a filler trying to be an actual song on the album. Its not even an instrumental or i wouldnt have classified how i did.i honestly think it was a long long filler, it doesnt seem to be an instrumental at all and the few lyrics that are spottedthroughout it are good, but not long enough or distinguishable enough from the background noise.<BR>2/5<BR>6. A Stranger- this song is...wow. It has probably the softest beat on the whole track, and easiest most feminine like vocals. They blend together wonderfully for a bizarre song, very light song. Yet it seems to carry a heavy air of anger and sadness desptie the light tone.<BR>3/5<BR>7. The Outsider- Another contender for best song on th album for me, the lyrics are incredible and flow beautifully. The music is energetic, angry and flowing all together in one. Maynards vocals are incredible here and really stand out after the previous song A Stranger. Opening and closing lyrics leave you begging for more<BR>5/5<BR>8. Crimes- really just a filelr track, no denying it, its still ok i guess and doesnt ruin the album in the least. plus it sort of makes sense to insert it where it is and why its there, not very good but what fillers are?<BR>1/5<BR>9. The Nurse Who Love Me- cover track and what seems to be the main swirling point of the album. it has light yet depressing vocals. they carry a deceptively innocent air to them as he sings about pills and whatnt. the background music here is very light, probably about as light as A Stranger with a faster beat to them. You're ready fr the song to be over by the time it is but you liked it while it lasted<BR>4/5<BR>10. Pet- Pet is probably the hardest song on the albnum. its beat is intense, fast and angry as hell. The lyrics are beautiful, energetic, depressing, angry and soothing at the same time someting few musicians and writers can do nowadays. Overall one of the best songs and can easily fit a big variety of moods. dont be put of by the blasting and overhwleming introduction.<BR>5/5<BR>11. Lullaby- another filler, hard to rate just a melodic womans voice against a very light background. nothing to interesting here though like Crimes it made sense to insert it where it is and why its there.<BR>1/5<BR>12. Gravity- thelast track on this amazing album, the lyrics are incredible and really feel like a thirteenth step to a 12 steps program. Incredible, just incredible, the vocals flow melodically, and the music is light but not as light as some of the other flowing tracks. Truly incredible<BR>5/5
B00009L1UP|5.0|Empire is a Great cd from start to finish.  I own everything Queensryche has ever done and love it all.  Queensryche as far as I'm concerned is one of Seattle's great treasures.  To anyone that wants to be entertained and not afraid of politics being in the mix should give them a try.
0385510438|3.0|When I picked up the book, I was expecting a legal thriller like so many of Grisham's previous books. This is not a legal thriller. Actually the main focus on this story isn't about the trial but about the main character's friendship with one of the jurors. It's not a bad book...but if you were looking for a legal thriller...this wasn't it. Wait for paperback if you really feel like buying the book.
B0001IN07Q|2.0|There comes a point when a consumer feels taken advantage of.  Michael Buble's CD/DVD combo &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; is one of those points.  First, there was a poorly produced soundtrack album.  Nobody took notice.  Next came Buble's self-titled debut, and many of us listened, but apparantly not enough of us.  Because after a couple of tracks for a soundtrack (Down With Love) and an unsatisfying 4-song Christmas EP, Record Producers decided to release &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; as an even bigger attempt and harder push to capture new fans.  Old fans are stuck with 2 new tracks and 6 cuts from the previous album recorded live.  These live performances capture nothing from what I'm guessing is a pretty jamming live show and sound as if they were taped through a Fisher Price cassette recorder.  But the surprising thing is, fans are eating this stuff up (read the reviews) despite the obvious Big Marketing Machine at work here.<br />I bought &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; for the DVD more than anything.  Little is seen, heard or known about Buble' here in the States and I thought the DVD would be a great chance to know a little more about the crooner and see him in action.  The DVD also sadly disappoints.  Running just an hour we get concert footage with interviews and 'real' moments of the band horsing around from the tour.  This is a good format for a concert video, but the problem is with the live concert footage.  It's edited like an MTV video.  Rapid-fire editing and swishing camera movements is not the way I want to see intimate classics like 'My Funny Valentine' or 'That's All' performed.  This is obviously the work of an amateur.  Buble' has personality, but the camera won't linger on him long enough to let it shine through.  To see how a great Swinging concert video is put together I highly recommend Harry Connick Jr's &quot;Swingin' Out Live&quot;.  <br />Buble's Camp better put together something more solid next time or they're going to start losing fans.You can only re-record the same song over and over again before people get bored!
0743454529|4.0|Took this book out the library yesterday and 1pm, finished it this morning at 10am.  Even though this is a &quot;typical&quot; Jodi Picoult book in formula - court scenes and surprise ending, I just love the stories this woman weaves and the insights she has.  The subject is close to my own heart, having a child with a fatal disease, and I was brought to tears many times throughout the story (have the tissues ready for the end of the book).  I would recommend it, especially if you enjoyed Picoult's other books.
B0001ENY6M|4.0|John Debney's score for the 'Passion of the Christ' is a curiosity.  The music paired with the film's images doesn't overpower or manipulate what's happening on screen.  But the interesting thing is, the score as a stand-alone listen is an amazing piece of work.  Dark and brooding with moments of enlightenment, but enough themes at work that it stands out as more than just filler.  This is a classical piece of Middle Eastern flavor with wonderful moments of chorus that can be oddly used as background 'noise' or focused meditation.  Good movie scores are getting harder to find especially in contemporary filmmaking, but Debney's is one of the better to come along in awhile.  Highly recommended.
0385335482|5.0|This book kept me turning the pages until late into the night. I found myself laughing out loud!  The main character was funny and very likable. I would recommend any of Sophie Kinsella's books to readers who want a quick fun read!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|This is an album that needs to be listened to more than just once. I cant believe so many people are dismissing it. It has already sold over 2 million copies in th U.S alone and deservedly so. Train Wreck, Stupid, Fallen and World On Fire are 4 of Sarah's greatest tracks. Sarah didnt need to reinvent her style or sound as she is a great artist and performer - period. Like many others this is not my favourite Sarah album but its still a great one. Give it a go.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt Pepper's is one of the greatest rock albums of the Beatles' career and also of all time.  The group kept pushing the musical limits and spent over 700 hours perfecting this album.  It is truly amazing the sound effects and musical experiences the Beatle's were able to achieve back in 1967.  This is a must own album for Beatles' fans and rock and roll fans alike.  I truly recommend listening to this album with some good headphones on to have the opportunity to hear everything this album has to offer.  I can't say enough great things about Sgt. Peppers!
B00005JMSE|5.0|I must admit that I had high expectations for this film, which usually leads to a stinging sense of disappointment come opening night when the product doesn;t measure up to my vision of it. I knew that this movie had a great cast and a great crew (Rick...BAKER, forgoshssakes!) and a great director and a wonderful pedigree as far as the story and character goes. So I knew that I was setting myself up for a disappointment of a major nature.<br />I could not have been more wrong.<br />Hellboy may not be a perfect movie (I will have to see it a couple more times before I make that claim) but it comes close enough to it that it doesn't matter one iota. Everything in this movie worked for me.... and apparently for the packed theater that I was in, as well.<br />If there is any justice in the world, this movie will make oodles of money and spawn a highly successful franchise. And if it doesn't? Well..... don't make Hellboy come over there, OK?<br />Thank you , Mr. Del Toro (and Company!) for such a wonderful gift! (And here's hoping that you get to make At the Mountains of Madness....... Go Cthulhu! ;^) )
B00000IOSU|4.0|Recorded live on her 1998 tour for her hugely successful &quot;Surfacing&quot; album, &quot;Mirrorball&quot; demonstrates what a powerful performer Sarah McLachlan &amp; her band are live in concert. The only debit to &quot;Mirrorball&quot; is that it's basically The &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy/Surfacing&quot; Show---all but two of the songs here are exclusively from these two albums, apart from &quot;Path Of Thorns&quot; (from &quot;Solace&quot;) and &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; (from &quot;The Brothers McMullen&quot; movie soundtrack). No songs from &quot;Touch,&quot; and only one song from &quot;Solace&quot;? That's kinda disappointing. But I'm only criticising the lopsided choice of live tracks, NOT the quality of them, which are all marvelous. Sarah &amp; her ace band do GREAT renditions of such songs as &quot;Building A Mystery,&quot; &quot;Good Enough,&quot; &quot;Adia,&quot; &quot;Path Of Thorns,&quot; &quot;Fear,&quot; &quot;Possession,&quot; and &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy,&quot; while Sarah does a remarkable solo piano stint on &quot;Angel.&quot; There's also a charming audience sing-along on the simple-but-sweet &quot;Ice Cream,&quot; which can't fail to bring a smile to your face. Sarah's voice is golden and angelic, and her interplay with the band is excellent. And the album *sounds* great, too.It's a sure bet that Sarah McLachlan will release another live album at some point, and hopefully it will feature songs from *all* of her wonderful albums. But &quot;Mirrorball&quot; is a more-than satisfying live document of this remarkable singer/songwriter, and should definitely be included in your Sarah CD collection.
B00013F38K|5.0|Forget the DVD technical flaws. This is one of the best TV series ever made. My 9 year grandson(brown belt karate)and I watch an episode every night. I don't know who enjoys the series  more. We are ready for Season Two.
B0000E6I1J|3.0|The songs were and are great. The premise of the concert is great.  The performers, unfortunately, WERE great, but many of them are losing their vocal ranges.  I am particularly disappointed in Jeff Lynn, who sounds like he is a 45 RPM record being run at 33 RPM.  McCartney at least has some vocal stretch left; Clapton and Petty are middle-of-the-road on this. I don't really think this CD was worth the money.  All the songs seem a little too dreary...are they too slow in tempo?  Is it the concert venue?  Something is just not energetic enough on these classic songs, and it depresses me to listen to it.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|Something's Gotta Give starts out with energy and charm. Nicholson and Keaton have great chemestry as two older people trying figure out, what now ? They're two successful and experienced people but neither of them really know what love is. They aren't crazy about each other at first but of course they fall in love. After they have ... though and fall in love, it should've just ended. Instead it goes on and on with Keaton wanting a relationship and Nicholson not knowing what he wants. By the time he figures out what he wants, most of the movie's charm is gone and it over-stayed it's welcome. The performances make you stick with it though even if you just want it to end already.  Although the supporting work by Keanu Reeves,  Frances Mcdormand and Amanda Peet are all good. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson carry this movie mostly on their own and do really good jobs at that. Cut off about 45 minutes and it would've been better though.
B00007G207|4.0|I'm so surprised that the Director's Cut would have detracted so much from the original version.  Whilst the original version concentrated the relationship between Alfredo &amp; Toto, the Director's Cut went deeper in exploring the relationship between Toto (or Salvatore de Vita) &amp; his first love, Elena.  Most of the new added scenes were concentrated towards third quarter of the movie &amp; subsequently, we have a richer &amp; more in-depth understanding of what motivated Toto to become the person that he is today.  A timeless movie about self-sacrifice, eternal love, friendship of the highest order.  Despite its age, Cinema Paradiso still has the capability to stir the emotion &amp; soul.  Arguably one of my favourite movies of all times.  No extra in this movie at all but to see how this movie was intended at the first place is a blessing!  Highly recommended
B00003CXCT|4.0|Like everyone who is a Star Wars fan I welcome the release date of the Classic Trilogy on DVD. I have built a home theater system in anticipation of that day when I can sit in my recliner and immerse my self in \\"A galaxy far, far away...\\" I plan on turning the volume up so the neighbors can here the lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader. But my excitement is, like a good Jedi, tempered. What about the famous Toshi Station scene? Or the Biggs on Tatooine conversation with Luke? These scenes (Well the Toshi Station scene does I am not sure about the Biggs scene still existing. There are still pictures in the original Star Wars storybook.) still exist. Why aren't these listed on the DVDs?  I think Mr. Lucas could have done something that no one has. He could have asked the fans what they want to see on the DVDs. Maybe he could have advertised it as \\"Make your voice heard! Cast you vote at [...] to see what should be on the DVDs\\" I know that is unprecedented but so were the Star Wars films. I also have mixed emotions about only the Special Editions available on DVD. Sure these movies do belong to George Lucas and he can do what he wants with them but...not really. Sure he owns all legal rights and intellectual rights etc, etc, etc. The movies have been adopted by so many people that allowing us to see only the Special Editions is like only being able to see your children if they have been cleaned up. They are still a part of us no matter what they look like.
B00005JL3A|2.0|Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror and new-school filmmaking and special effects. Everything about the movie has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some wire-fu, and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned animatronics. As you can see, I was never particularly won over by the film.<br />Resident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called \\"The Hive, a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation, situated underneath Raccoon City. One of the lab workers sabotages the place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills its victims and brings them back as zombies.<br />We then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed, she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia. Before she can collect her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider (Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the mansion. Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that.<br />As directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far superior and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills. Anderson shows an inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best, hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells. Worse yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in this picture.<br />Actually, what's probably most memorable about the picture as a wholeis how maddeningly inconsistent it is in terms of pacing and excitement. For every scene that's fun to watch, there's another that's just plot-stopping, whether it's watching the survivors move from one bland-looking corridor to another, or Milla Jovovich jump-kicking zombie dogs in slow motion, or a computer program tiresomely going over the very simple zombie rules.<br />There are also some glaring technical faults that I'm surprised were't fixed or edited in post-production, such as an unbearably loud industrial score that blocks out most of the expository dialogue, most of it uttered by Colin Salmon, who if you're familiar with his work, already has a pretty quiet voice that'd be inaudible matched up against anyone else in the cast.<br />The zombies in this movie are your basic \\"pale and rotting skin\\" undead, some with the occasional missing bits of face and flesh. Unfortunately, the zombies in this film have goofy-looking mechanical movements, as if though their joints were so stiff, they could barely show much in the way of mobility. Maybe it's the effects of rigor mortis, but this makes zombies far less enjoyable to observe.<br />Most of the cast ranges from non-descript to just plain awful. Easily the worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez, whose only distinct trait is a perpetual frown; she's given a lot of macho dialogue, but Jenette Goldstein she is not. Surprisingly, it's Jovovich who stands out as the film's kickass heorine. Sure, she's not much of an actress, but she's got the physical stuff down pat, for the most part. And she's cute enough that I don't mind seeing her in a slinky red dress, as well as a couple of scenes that briefly reveal some of her naughty bits.<br />Because there's hardly any gore, Resident Evil doesn't really work all that well as a zombie flick. And because it's not scary, horror is out of the question, too. But being a zombie fan, I'm prone to forgiving movies of this ilk simply because I'm pretty easy to please. Resident Evil is a passable enough timewaster, worth a rental, but it's certainly nothing I'll ever give much thought to again. <br />Compared to the recent spate of zombie horror, Resident Evil might very well be the most lackluster of the bunch. It's never as intriguing or intelligent as 28 Days Later or as marvelously thrilling as the Dawn of the Dead remake and it's never as hilariously enjoyable as the misguided House of the Dead, proving that mediocrity really can be less entertaining than plain awfulness.<BR>** 1/2 out of *****

0679311718|5.0|On Thursday 4/1/04  I watched a PBS Frontline presentation called \\"Ghosts of Rwanda\\". <br />1] It was a fine show; technically, artistically, ethically, and as history. It was balanced and fair, but appropriately damning to those who \\"knew but didn't act\\". <br />2] It should serve as a chilling reminder of what happens when deliberative bodies (UN, US, Belgium, etc) puff up in rhetorical diplomatic speech, but then cut-and-run. Whithin the US, much of both the Left and the Right seemed uninterested in Rwanda. Though Ghanan and Canadian (Dallaire) UN commanders, and their few personnel, demonstrated superhuman bravery on the ground...I sure as hell would not want to count on the suits at UN headquarters to pull my bacon out of the fire! The UN is no different (and in many ways is worse) than many nation-states. It will be some time before an organization truely exists that reprsents world justice and order. Until then, I'm afraid that individual nations will need to retain sovereignty, if only to ensure justice and order for their own citizens.

B00005JKC3|4.0|As far as recent comic book movies go this one has been panned the most by fans and critics alike.  It really shouldn't be.  A case can be made that The Hulk is indeed the best of the new bunch of Marvel movies.  I'm not going to make that case but it can be made.<br /><br />The cast here is stronger than most action movies by a long shot.  We have Eric Bana playing Dr. Bruce Banner who is exposed to gama radiation that triggers his father's genetic mutations that were planted in his son.  He then becomes a being of immeasurable power, the Incredible Hulk.  Bana brings an easy to relate to demeanor and some acting chops to the table.  We will see more of him no doubt.  Nick Nolte plays the film's main villain and as it turns out, he is also Banner's father.  He is solid and entertains as Nolte always does.  Nick Nolte is one of those rare actors who convinces you that he isn't acting but yet at the same time we see a little bit of Nick shine through in everyone one of his roles.  His presence alone puts him in a tier just below the Nicholsons and De Niros of the world.  He is great as always, a dedicated master of his craft.  The more subtle actor, Sam Shepard, plays the father of Banner's love interest in the film and executes his role with near perfection.  He is one of those actors that you can't really credit until he finally slips under your radar which is the true sign that Shepard is doing his job.  In addition to being the leading lady's father, he is also a General who wants to contain and/or destroy the Hulk.  His daughter is of course Betty Ross and she is played by Jennifer Connelly.  Now, when I heard that Ang Lee (Ice Storm; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) was directing The Hulk and Jennifer Connelly was in it, I knew this film would be very well done.  Connelly has shown her amazing talent in sad roles only, but she is an outstanding actress based on these performances and I look forward to her showing more range in the future.<br /><br />So the cast is great and there were outlets for them to work well and show off their stuff.  Ang Lee's direction was also handled quite well.  His crisp touch complimented the cinematography and the split screening and comic book like camerwork was the perfect fit.  Overall The Hulk is well done.  So why didn't some people like it?  I think a lot of people that went to see this film expected it to be a collection of near endless action sequences but the film clearly went far deeper than that, much to the chagrin of the mindless zombie mobs that flocked to see Daredevil and other crap.  I was pleasantly surprised to see yet another comic book brought to the screen with a serious touch and strong talent.  I enjoyed Hulk for that and I actually cared about the characters enough to wait the movie out and watch it unfold. It's a shame that a good movie can be brought down by word of mouth stuff like \\"it was too slow\\" or \\"it was too serious\\".<br /><br />The major flaw that I had with the film was it's climax battle sequence.  I guess it was too busy and fuzzy for me to find as compelling as the rest of the film but in the context is still seemed to work out.  It also possesses an incredibly basic and ordinary narrative.  The conclusion of the film made up for most of those feelings and I walked away from the Hulk with a safe and confident feeling about this character's legacy.  I'm quite sure we won't see a sequel because of the profit this film made but that is O.K. by me because everything that needs to be said was said.  I just hope that in terms of comic book movies people don't consider this the worst of it's time.  Only a decade ago us Marvel Comic fans had to almost endure a Fantastic Four movie that was not released (I saw it at a convention and it was really bad but funny) and actually sit through a straight-to-video Captain America and Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher.  Try to keep that in mind when watching Lee's above average effort.<br /><br />Good for Lee for taking a bigbudget project and making a real movie out of it. Maybe one day we will look back on it and recognize that it took real guts to do that.real movie out of it. Maybe one day we will look back on it and recognize that it took real guts to do that.
1565123875|5.0|Purple Hibiscus by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is actually a young adult fiction title - but it'd be a shame to limit its depth and complexity to teens, so is reviewed here as a recommended pick for adult readers as well. Set in Nigeria, it tells of a privileged teen and her older brother who find themselves increasingly at odds with their father's religious fanatic ways. When the kids visit their aunt, it's to enter a new world of freedom and laugher - just as a military coup threatens the country. Inner and outer turmoil blend in this complex story of politics, religion, and change.
B000089RVX|3.0|The first half of this album is descent quality modern rock, but thats it. The second half seems like one long dragged out song.  There aren't any significant beats or rythyms that makes this album stand out above anything else today.  I would probly reccomend this to a 16 year old teen girl that enjoys rock, the audience doesn't span that much farther.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie is hands down the greatest movie of 2003.  Bill Murray has been in other amazing movies such as Caddyshack, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and Groundhog Day, but this is my absolute favorite.  His performance of a depressed, out-of-his-prime movie star is deep and believable, and Ms. Scarlett Johansson is beautiful, and a wonderful actress.  Also you should definately get the soundtrack, whether you've seen the movie or not, because it has wonderful bands and artists like Peaches and the Jesus and Mary Chain (my favorite band).
0743454529|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is a sensitive and thought-provoking portrayal of a family deep in crisis.  <br />Anna Fitzgerald is an adolescent who was conceived for the purpose of being an organ donor for her sister, Kate, who has a rare form of leukemia.  The story begins with Anna deciding that enough is enough, and seeking legal action to put a stop to it.  Both Kate's illness and Anna's actions impact each member of the family--as well as her attorney and her guardian ad litem--in a unique and profound way.<br />My Sister's Keeper pulled me in from the first page and held on straight through to the explosive twist at its conclusion, which has become Picoult's signature.  Told in alternating chapters from the perspectives of several of the characters involved, this is a sensitive, deeply moving and thought-provoking story that left me pondering my true moral and ethical beliefs.  <br />Highly recommended, My Sister's Keeper is an excellent choice for book discussion groups.
0385504209|3.0|Fiction has gotten more interested in fast and cheap thrills. While &quot;Code&quot; is a good read, it conscientiously brings the reader to turn pages through use of short one-two page chapters and outcomes that are only casually disguised by superfluous reasonings. Regardless of the facts and conspiracy truths, Dan Brown's writing is simple minded and seems to be engendered toward the reader who has only a bare minimum time for sitting down with a book. No thought required, other than remembering what you read in the previous page.
0671027344|5.0|Someone recommended this book to me, and I thought it sounded good so I checked it out. I must tell you, it WAS NOT what I expected at all--it was so much more! I admit that the first few pages I was like \\"so?\\" yet they were still pretty interesting to read. As the story progresses, you understand Charlie's personality more, and the book becomes almost impossible to put down (I admit I read it in like 2 days). It's so simply written, yet so meaningful at the same time. The ending is just beautiful... A perfect read for both genders and all ages... Well, maybe not a 5 year old, but you know. <BR>YOU MUST READ IT!!!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theaters in the late fall. I loved it then and I love it even more now.<br />The plot focuses on Harry (Jack Nicholson), a very cool sixty-something New York bachelor, who serially dates women between the ages of 25 and 30. He does not apologize for his behavior; he simply is this type of person. Or so he thinks.<br />The movie opens with Harry traveling to the Hamptons with yet another piece of eye candy, Marin (Amanda Peet), for a fun, no-strings-attached weekend at her mother's house. The assumption was her mother was staying in the city. But no, before Harry and Marin can consummate their relationship, they stumble upon her mother, the famed playwright Erica Barry (Diane Keaton), and her sister (Frances McDormand). Awkwardness ensues...and even more awkwardness when Harry has a heart attack and Erica is left taking care of him after everyone departs for the city. To complicate matters further, Harry's young stud of a doctor (Keanu Reeves), has fallen for Erica. And so Erica ends up in a romantic triangle with Harry and the doctor.<br />Many wonderful small moments occur in this movie. The supporting characters--Amanda Peet, Frances McDormand, and surprisingly Keanu Reeves--are outstanding. Nancy Meyers, the screenwriter and director, makes sure that everyone realizes that despite their glossy coats, these characters have depth. Harry was at one time engaged to Diane Swayer; Amanda Peet's character is an auctioneer at Christie's; Keanu Reeves is not just a boy toy but a doctor.<br />The lead performance by Keaton and Nicholson are memorable. Diane Keaton shows you humor, intelligence and pain all at the same time. Nicholson allows this character to have depth and to grow beyond his shallow beginnings.<br />The DVD extras are well worth the price. Usually I understand after a viewing, why a deleted scene was cut. However this dvd includes a deleted scene with Nicholson singing &quot;La Vie Rose&quot; at a karaoke bar. He would have been nominated for an Oscar if it had been kept on. Likewise, the two tracks are treasures. On the first track, the director Nancy Meyers (with a little help from Keaton) explores the premise of the movie and the various difficulties during shooting. On the second track, Meyers and Nicholson examine his various acting choices throughout the film. You realize how hard he works and that he's not just being Jack.<br />I would recommend this movie to fans of romantic comedy and of Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson. I would recommend the dvd in particular to individuals who want to learn more about the choices in filmmaking--and of course to lovers of romantic comedy everywhere.

B000005IU2|5.0|As a native Michigander who saw the Stooges perform this, and the rest of their albums live on many occasions, I can attest to the fact this is the album that best represents the chaos of a live show. From the live shows featuring this music at the Factory Ballroom, Silverbell and the Eastown Theater, the Stooges went beyond their basic cord simplicity on the eponymously titled, first album to an experimental sound that landed Ron Ashton a position in Rolling Stone's top 100 guitarist of all time list.  This recording convinced a lot of people that the Stooges were much more than a novelty act.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|In an age of constant hype, one tends to become de-sensitized to \\"The Next Big Thing\\".  Thankfully Franz Ferdinand are here to blow any pretenders straight back across the ocean.  Their formula is fiendishly simple yet clever.  take a bundle of diverse influences, from Joy Division to the Beatles, make them better, construct a humorless, robotic stage presence, MEAN IT, and rule the world.<br />Their self stated aim is to make music that people can dance to, with guitars, and they fulfill this aim better than you could ever dream.  With an ironically detached, bisexual drawl that only the (presumably genetically engineered) (...) son of Morrissey and Jarvis could rival they sneer their way through the album with pithy phrases and sloganeering that hopefully can change lives and drag pop music out of it's manufactured and/or pointlessly derivative stupor.  The music bounces, charges and stutters along like an angular dervish and the whole effect is so...dancable that you won't be able to stop yourself from shaking along like an epileptic in a lightning storm.<br />The highlight of the album is of course \\"Take me Out\\", a shoo-in for single of the year on both sides of the Atlantic, but the rest of the album hovers close behind in terms of quality, proving this band to be no flash in the pan.<br />Come in garage rock, your time is up. Franz Ferdinand rule this world now...
7119005901|5.0|First of, this has to be one of the most epic novels I've ever read. Secondly, it's attention to detail is AWESOME. If you love epics and a little bit of history (it's not boring in the least, I couldnt put it down) then this is the book for you. the number of pages might be intimidating to that of a casual reader, but this book moves fast. A must have for any fan of epics.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Me and Mr. Johnson?  I think not, Eric.<br />You know, when you see this CD on the shelf and are a fan of &quot;EC&quot; then you pick it up.  I looked this CD over several times and sure enough, it looks like Clapton finally sat down solo with his guitar and slide - and played the Robert Johnson classics!  I couldn't wait to get home.<br />Alas, after opening the CD packaging I find a paper listing the piano players, bass players, drummer and two other guitarists.<br />To put it simply, this is really weak - don't even fool with a $5 used one.<br />Eric, if you plan to record the remainder of the Johnson songs then please, sit down by yourself with guitar, slide and microphone and give it your best shot.  Forget the band.<br />This isn't even a good blues cd.  Weak, weak, weak.
B000159EEW|3.0|Here's the part where I say how great Schindler's List is. It's beautifully shot, revealing, raw, moving, brilliantly acted and directed, and makes the appearance of one of Hollywood's finest masterpieces of all time.<BR>Now here's the part where I explain why Schindler's List is one of the biggest and most overlooked pieces of propaganda ever made. Was I supposed to like Schindler in the end just because his concious won him over? He was a Nazi, and in essense, a traitor. Most people do not know that the actual Schindler sold that gold ring given to him by his workers for alcohol. Yes, what he did was great, but for the Jews to call him righteous is criminal. He wasn't a good man, and I did not sympathize by the end of this film.<BR>Second, this movie demonizes the German people. Amon Goeth was one of the meanest villains ever presented on screen, and this movie made it seem as if his Nazi superiors let him get away with this nonsense. In actuality, he was charged with brutality by his own people. But this was conveniently left out of the film. I wonder why....<BR>When someone makes a movie that gives the Germans their story to tell, someone let me know. Until then, Stephen Spielberg can keep his sad propaganda.
B00005JMSE|4.0|First off, I want to tell you that I have had minimal experience with the Hellboy comics. this may lead you to not trust my following review, but I had to get that off of my chest. Now, this review will focus on the aspects of it being a movie, not being as close to the comic book as possible.<br />First of all, hats off to the costume designers who worked so obviously diligently on this movie. Nearly all of the scenes in which Hellboy starred had him looking nearly real, with a minimal usage of FX. Kroenen especially looked real in his tortured and mutilated body. Very, very creepy. In the opening scene, in which Hellboy is summoned, there are large amounts of Nazis, who all look like they fit the part. Except for Rasputin (who wears and open coat when it's raining in Europe???).<br />Next, I have to comment on how well Ron Perlman did in his role as Hellboy. Although he didn't have the best scripting given to him, he pulled off his comedic role better than expected. Also, the man who played Abe Sapien gave him the best walk I have ever seen, which really gave him an amphibious quality.<br />As for directing, I feel that not much of this blew me away. There was nothing that haden't been done before, and certainly no great uses of the camera.<br />The one downside to this movie was the syrupy ending. I had had a lot of fun during the movie, and was let down by the horrible ending to the love story due to both bad dialogue and the crummy acting of the woman who played Liz Sherman.<br />All in all, this is simply an okay movie. I would give this a 3.5, but it was cool enough for me to give it a four.
B0000640SA|5.0|To conclude, this movie rocks , although you may need to watch it a few times to fully grasp all the subtlties of what's going on.<br />The Limited edition version is by turns incredible rewarding and distressingly frustrating!  I don't know who decided to make it in such a way, but I truly believe they need to rethink their strategy - not everyone has the patience to play games with a DVD each time they want to watch it, and those of us renting it from our local soul-destroying chain video store that shall remain nameless, don't get the inlay cards etc. leading to a puzzling night...<br />It challenges a lot of our assumptions of truth and memory and really forces us to home in on our own ideas of which narrative we believe, and should we trust the narrator.<br />Basically each disc has a set of psychiatric test questions that loop around, and depending on your answer offer you various bonus features.<br />Disc one isn't too hard to work out, but disc two can be prohibitively obstinate.  Thank god then for the invention of the &quot;Internet&quot;. Accessing this through a &quot;Computer&quot; will lead you to a bunch of fan sites that have maps and hints to guide you through the labyrinth, which does come off as being slightly rewarding.<br />The movie opens at the end and replays in short segments leading up to the beginning of the plot, while it alternates with black and white sections that go forward in time to the start of the real plot. The plot itself is dark and disturbing, yet tinged with a surprising amount of humor (&quot;See, I have this condition...&quot;).<br /><br />The main reason I picked up this DVD was the &quot;alternate endings&quot; feature on the back of the box. This turns out to also be slightly misleading. What you can get is 3 different directors commentaries over the ending, with three different ways to interpret the closing (or opening?!) scenes.  I actually found this really cool, as each narrative presented by the director is presented as fact, and it's really cool to watch them all back to back with the thought &quot;I'm being lied to!&quot; in the back of your mind.  That's pretty damn cool.<br />Very rarely a movie comes along that is so good it makes you rethink everything you once thought about movies.  Memento is that kind of film.<br />The other special feature I was really looking forward to is the chance to see the whole movie in the correct sequence, which is also buried in Disc 2.  This will certainly clear things up for anyone that didn't understand it the right way round, but I got kinda bored watching the straight version, possibly cos I'd just watched the &quot;right&quot; version the day before.<br />Anyway, memento will make you a better person and cause girls to fall at your feet.  Not really, but you should go buy it anyway.s fact, and it's really cool to watch them all back to back with the thought &quot;I'm being lied to!&quot; in the back of your mind.

0920668372|1.0|My, how I was drawn-in to this lovely story about mutual love between a son and his mother. When I finished it, I thought, \\"There is something weird about this book, what is it?\\"  I think many readers agree the sneaking-in-with-the-ladder is a bit much.  It's just too surreal for me.  Yes the sentiments are real and deep, but surely there was a better way to show this.  Of course it speaks to the generation where two-parent families (mom and dad, male and female for further clarification) are a disappearing breed.  No doubt many single moms (widowed, divorced, or single) would find great empathy with this.  It is a touching story, but it seems to stress the finality of death a bit too existentially for me.  As a high school physics and latin teacher, whose worldview has been largely fashioned by the classics and historic Christianity, I would never read this to my child.  I guess I'm just too old school.  ...
0385504209|4.0|I was not interested in reading this book, but a friend lent it to me and said it was good. They were correct. It is an extremely readable book, loaded with symbols, puzzles, art, and mystery. The chapters are very short, making it easy to pick up and put down as needed.<br />I was familiar with much of the subject matter beforehand (so much for the real, historic conspiracy!), so many of the revelations were obvious to me - still I am not great with puzzles and though I love art I am no expert, so he did give me a few things I wasn't aware of before. I will have to do some research (to me, this is a good thing) on some of the things mentioned, just to make sure the author wasn't taking artistic license (a bad thing, IMOP. Real things and people should be portrayed as they are/were).<br /><br />As much as I liked it, it failed to make a perfect score. I felt the ending was a bit trite, and the villain was just a bit too obvious. Also, if he did take license with DaVinci's art I will lower my rating!
0385504209|3.0|My friend had been raving about this book and said she couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to finish it so I could read it and discuss it with her. So I had great expectations that were quickly dashed. Starts out with a bang, and runs downhill. When I read a thriller, I want to be surprised at each turn, not screaming out the solutions pages before the characters arrive at them. There is not one single surprise here--well, OK, I wasn't positive about Fache's allegiance until near the end. It is just predictable and I wanted something more.
B00008DDSC|3.0|Romantic comedies are mostly a collection of tired and predictable cliches nowadays, presenting stereotyped characters in unsurprising situations. Fortunately, sometimes appears a movie that tries to add something new and original to this limited genre, offering innovative perspectives. &quot;Secretary&quot; is one of those rare films, which actually dares to bring a breath of fresh air and add a couple of different concepts. Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader (both perfect in their roles)star as the offbeat and twisted couple who shares a weird connection, going beyond the typical and distant boss/ employee relationship. Steven Shainberg`s directing debut is an interesting and compelling indie cinematic experience, one that wisely combines dark humour, S&amp;M, romance, dramatic tension and also works as an intriguing character study. However, the ending is a bit disappointing, since it presents a somewhat standard and expected resolution, similar to the romantic comedies it tries to satirize. Still, &quot;Secretary&quot; is innovative enough for the most part, making for a solid and recommended effort.<br />A peculiar and convincing film.
B00003CX8U|1.0|I loved Chicago and thought from the other posted ratings that this would be just as great - or better.  It was NOT.  I haven't been able to watch the full movie YET!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Honestly, this is why I don't watch TV anymore! Fox has lost yet another viewer. I can't stand when big wig corporate types finally get something right and they pull the plug on a show before it finally takes off. They'd rather show mind numbing reality shows, then stick it out with a possible classic. Being in the military I rarely have time to watch tv anyway. The best thing to come out of Fox was Firefly and Stargate SG-1 reruns. Just put the corporate guys from Fox in a small room with some Reavers and let the guys from Sci-Fi figure the mess out. Anyways, This is probably one of the best shows to ever be cancelled prematurely. This box set is highly recommended to anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor. I just wish the almighty gods from Sci-Fi can yet again revive yet another Fox mistake.<br />OORAHH!
B00011F5DK|5.0|At first glance, Blokus is a simple puzzle game.  However, once you start playing you realize that strategy, logic, and great spatial sense are key components to winning the game.  The game pieces are colorful plastic, but too small and fragile for boisterous children or very young children.  Older children enjoy the competition and challenge of filling up the game board and beating their competition.  <BR>     Blokus is a wonderful math game that teaches children how to take turns, reason, and use those geometric transformations that they study in school.
B000002NG7|2.0|Despite some apealling moments that show this bands` uniqueness and stenght (\\"Stripsearch\\", \\"Mouth to Mouth\\", \\"Last Cup of Sorrow\\", \\"Ashes to Ashes\\"), \\"Album of the Year\\" is nothing special for the most part. The majority of the songs aren`t bad, yet they never seem to rise above average, merely listenable material either. Overall, this record lacks personality and staying power, presenting bland and not very intense rock tracks. Faith No More can do better and quirkier music than this middle-of-the-road effort without distinction or impact. <br />Not memorable enough.
B000005RFQ|4.0|This is a really cool album but the production is absolutely god awful.Even with it being remastered too.The songs are great but is the production supposed to be bad?If you thought Metallica's And Justice For All and Slayer's Reign In Blood had poor production you havent seen anything yet.On the other hand some of Ian Gillan's best singing  well screaming anyway and Tony Iommi's best guitar work are present here.They deserve a better producer.Trashed is a great song but the other songs are more amusing than heavy.The lyrics sort of make me laugh.Its unintentionally funny but its cool just the same.Thats why I like it its pretty stupid but great fun to listen to.Any Black Sabbath historian should own this.
0790734850|4.0|Sex, violence, and scandal all rolled up in one great story. A mystery and thriller, this movie is a joy to watch. Guy Pearce is the real star of this film. The only complaint is that there are too many important characters to keep track of and that confuses the story just a little.
B000001FS3|5.0|Track by track, this is U2's strongest album, with no obvious filler material like in The Unforgettable Fire.<br />&quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;- My favorite song on the album. Incredible gutiars, and Bono's voice has never been better. 10/10<br />&quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;- Some of Bono's best lyrics. 10/10<br />&quot;With or Without You&quot;- A chilling, often misinterpretated love song. 10/10<br />&quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;- This one is a let-down. Good guitars, but the lyrics fall flat. 7/10<br />&quot;Running to Stand Still&quot;- A slow, hypnotic elegy along the lines of &quot;Bad&quot;. 9.5/10<br />&quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;- Most underrated song on the album. Envigorating guitars work well with Bono's soaring voice. 10/10<br />&quot;In God's Country&quot;- Great, but a little too short. 9/10<br />&quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot;- Nice country vibe to it, but the keyboards can get irritating. 8/10<br />&quot;One Tree Hill&quot;- A surging, sad number dedicated to a dead friend. 10/10<br />&quot;Exit&quot;- Closest thing to filler on the album. Slow start, but it picks up at the end. 6/10<br />&quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;- Beautiful elegy and a fitting end to the album. 9/10
6305499365|3.0|A pleasant and witty surprise, &quot;Office Space&quot; is an offbeat and enticing comedy that presents a glimpse into the boring, dull and predictable corporate world. This movie wisely focuses the tedious and mundane situations that occur in multiple offices today, delivering an amusing and realistic cast of characters. <br />Ron Livingston plays the average mid-twenties guy who suddently gets terribly bored with his job and decides it`s time to call it it quits. This event will lead to some funny and interesting situations, making for an entertaining and true-to-life (even if a bit cartoonish) cinematic experience. Director Mike Judge, whose previous work includes MTV`s &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot;, knows how to create a clever and intelligent movie with a lot of dead-on observations about the daily and mundane routines. <br />Although &quot;Office Space&quot; displays a certain low-budget feel, the acting is very convincing and the characters are quite an achievement. Sure, this film hasn`t great camera tricks, a stunning photography or a superb soundrack, still it works well and stands as an above-average comedy. The comical approach is low-key, delivering subtle and ironic observations and avoiding the typical and predictable slapstick tendencies that are presented in most comedies today. It also shares a couple of similarities with the famous comic strip (and TV series) &quot;Dilbert&quot;, where one`s job is boring as hell.<br />Generates some genuine laughs.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|As far as more recent films go, Lost in Translation sparks a love/hate relationship for me like no other.  Overall, I find the film rather enjoyable, but at the same time there is this duel nature surrounding it that I find to be both admirable and disdainable.<br />For me this duel nature lies at the heart of the task undertaken by Sofia Coppola.  On one hand the film is clearly something along the lines of the works of Godard, Antonioni and Kar Wai, a notion which Coppola herself didn't hide in her Oscar night acceptance speech.  And on the other hand, we also have the Hollywoodized (albeit Hollywood laced with the indie-spirit) nature of the film that is also very apparent throughout.  The characters, while often different from the norm, still have very stereotypical qualities, the overall image presented of Japan feels very Hollywoodized, and on top of it all there is the dry humor of Bill Murray.  What we are essentially presented with is a film that is both a detached/modernest/post-modernist/art house work along the lines of the earlier mentioned artists and an \\"outside, yet still inside of Hollywood\\" Hollywood film.  <br />As a fan of the filmmakers she has been inspired by, I have a deep respect for Coppola in bringing forth that type of filmmaking to a mainstream audience.  Yet, with regard to the film's artistic merits, there is also a real problem in Hollywoodizing a style of filmmaking that at its essence is anti-Hollywood.  By making the film relatively mainstream, it can also be seen as going against the type of filmmaking it admires.  But to be fair, this same argument can be made against any film trying to blur the lines of Art cinema and Mainstream fare.  The difference with Lost in Translation (compared to say Punch-Drunk Love), is that Lost in Translation is SO influenced by such past works that it is impossible not to notice (for anyone familiar with such works going in) the mainstream/art cinema clash.  Instead of having its own voice that references such past works along the way, the film ultimately becomes a distortion of what has come before it.  Pop in In the Mood For Love,  L' Avventura or My Life to Live after watching Lost in Translation, and you'll get the point.<br />Again, although I'm rather critical about the overall nature of the film, I still find it very enjoyable.  It is a great exercise in creating a mood of detachment.  The main characters are detached from their lives, their surroundings and ultimately one another.  The wonderful cinematography also plays a big role here, as the camera positioning helps further the mood of detachment a number of times throughout the film.  And then obviously, there are the fabulous performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  At the end of the day the film has all the ingredients of a great work, but still seems to be missing that extra-something to make it truly special.  <br />The film serves as a nice addition to the growing trend of films on the fringe of Hollywood that play on the traditional expectations of romantic comedies and romance in Hollywood film in general, right alongside Punch Drunk-Love and the recent Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br />*** 1/2, (8.0/10)
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I thought the movie was excellent. It's a must see for any member of the family especially when it's a family night.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|i am accustomed to searching through reviews and tiny, low quality demos to try and find new bands.  i was surprised to find this entire album available on their website to listen to.  so stop reading biased reviews and go to [...]<BR>and then buy it like i'm going to!<BR>enjoy!
0385504209|5.0|This book is a tremendous amount of fun. It's a beach read -- Brown's not trying to be Umberto Eco -- that I zipped through in a day. What's genius about it is that Brown takes something that most of us are steeped in and interested in, a particular faith, and asks the reader to approach it from a historical context instead of a divine one. He does a very good job of gathering a lot of facts (about Opus Dei, the Knights Templar, etc.) and weaving them together in a plausible &quot;what if&quot; scenario. Best of all, he gives a great gift to the reader in that he sparks your interest in investigating these things for yourself -- an impressive accomplishment.<br />He's a curious and inventive writer of pulp thrillers and he deserves his success. I'm looking forward to reading his other work.
B000060P79|2.0|I don't know how people can even compare Simple Plan or New Found Glory to Good Charlotte. Simple Plan has nothing interesting to say, its all corny love songs or songs about the lead singer wanting to &quot;do whatever he feels like doing&quot;. Good Charlotte covers many other topics in thier songs such as: snobby rich people, being an individual, materialism, suicide, what the world thinks of achievements, loss of a parent, comical horror and so much more. Not to mention their songs are alot faster too...<br />1. I'd Do Anything: Musically this is the best song on the album. There are good guitar riffs in the verses. Unfortunately, it had to be a corny love song. It does get points for having Mark Hoppus as a guest though.  <BR>2. The Worst Day Ever: Wah wah wah I'm having a bad day. Boring, slow, guitar riffs. Bad song.  <BR>3. You Don't Mean Anything: Boring. The chorus sounds like this &quot;you dont you dont you dont you dont mean anything to me&quot;. Whiney, stupid, pointless. Even having Joel Madden do backup vocals can't save this one.   <BR>4. I'm Just A Kid: Lyrically this is a generic song but its actually okay. The guitar riffs are a little slow and boring though.  <BR>5. When I'm With You: :::yawn::: wow a love song. How suprising! <BR>6. Meet You There: Slow, almost Backstreet Boy-ish love song.        <BR>7. Addicted: The hit single, and I cant really see why. The lyrics aren't memorable at all. Its just another cheesy love song, I mean &quot;I'd walk a thousand miles to get you&quot;? PLEASE. The intro sounds okay and theres a good guitar bridge but besides that its not nearly as good as what other pop-rock bands offer.        <BR>8. My Alien: Blah. Its about the lead singer having an Alien girlfriend. Its a little original I guess but its extremely cheesy. The intro sounds okay.        <BR>9. God Must Hate Me: The world hates me, blah blah blah. This has been done a million times before, if you want a good song with the same type of theme try Little Things by Good Charlotte.        <BR>10. I Won't Be There: Mommy you dont treat me right so I'm gonna run away! At least the intro sounds cool...        <BR>11. One Day: Mommy, one day I won't have to listen to you! Thats the theme of the song. BAD.        <BR>12. Perfect: This is okay, at least it strays away from their usual love songs or the world hates me type ordeal. But aside from the main riff, the guitar riffs still sound stale.        <BR>13. Grow Up: Mommy I dont wanna grow up! This is good musically though, the bridge actually sounds cool. And it gets points for mentioning Blink-182 and Good Charlotte :-D<BR>14. Christmas: UGH! This is something I'd expect from a Disney pop star or boyband, not a supposed &quot;rock band&quot;. If their going to do a Christmas song do it right, like Blink-182 did.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|this album is too good to describe....take any good ol rock album and smoke a leaf and try to find the differnce.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|About No Vacancy: I'm pretty sure everyone who commented on Heal Me, I'm Heartsick are fans of Adam Pascals voice (im a huge fan too!) And if Adam sings it, it automatically becomes a great song. Personally, I feel the two songs he sings are worth the price of the cd!!!<br />All in all, this cd ROCKS!!! I would have liked more Who and the Doors (my favorite bands) but this is a very good mix. The Darkess is an awesome band!! I could have done without the werid T-Rex song Ballrooms of Mars, but, thats ok. <BR>ROCK ON, GUYS!!!
B00008DDXL|1.0|I just bought this movie yesterday and I expected it to be like the book. Then when I got it it was horribe possibly one of the worst movies ever. The acting seems like they are not realy scared. There is too much special efects even for spiders walking on the floor they look very fake. Hagrids acting was like he did not realy care. The only thing what keeps me from giving this only half a star is the acting of dombledoor it was superb he acts like ho realy cares for what he is trying to do. I hope the next movie will shine over this one. And for those of you who gave this movie 55555555 stars Go home to your mama
B00005JKJA|3.0|Wow.<BR>Um...OK...this movie was...umm...wait, let me start over.<br />This movie was...the most...the most...INTERESTING?...movie I have seen so far? Yeah. That's the word. Interesting.<br />I'm still confused. But I liked it. Naomi Watts was excellent! and it was a treat to see Ann Miller! <BR>The imagery was stunning to say the least, but I won't be going behind any diners for a long,long time. Watch this film. You won't ever forget it.
B000089RV6|5.0|Like so many other hard rockers they broke into it with this no holds-barred, razor-toothed, bat out of hell, balls out bad ass of a album.  They let the world know who they were and all of what they stood for.  And like so many other bands they did it with they're own taste of style which was so different from every one else.  They don't consider themselves a metal band but with music like that they don't have to cosider themselves any darn thing except good.  Like so many other bands they escalated and changed as the times went by, but that was the problem they did it so much that their lead singer ended up dying, a heart and soul for any band.  But then came the next step in change Brian Johnson or Back in Black.  With his rusty bagpipes and hard- loving lyrics ACDC's death became they're rebirth as Monsters of Rock.  The odds were all against them with they're lead singer dead, the band in morning, and recognition from Highway to Hell they had everything to lose.  Would there be a comeback?  Oh, they would come back and only stronger than ever.  What made Back in Black  so amazing was not that they were able to come back from a devastating loss or that it was so different from the usual ACDC music but that it was so different period, from all rock.  From the hard-hitting dark and haunting love songs like &quot;Let me put my love into you&quot; and &quot;You shook me all night long&quot; to the rabid bites and chills of &quot;Hells Bells&quot; &quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot; &quot;Shake a Leg&quot; and &quot;Back in Black&quot; and then at the very end the ultimate F U to the dads and moms and nagging neighbors who told you to turn down or shut that garbage off &quot;Rock and roll ain't noise pollution&quot;.  In those songs they portrayed what is now looked at as  the current ACDC:  the incredibly hard and varied guitar solos from the Youngs, the leatherthroated licks like a &quot;Beware of Dog&quot; bark from Brian Johnson and most importantly the molding of it alllike they had been playing together from the start.  In comparison the sheer joy you get from listening to this album is like listening to Mozart for the first time if you liked classical music but in this case extremely hard rock.  Just to let you know  I'm starting to listen to classical music and I love Mozart.  I can't think of an album that makes me want to bang my head more stomp my foot harder or yell the catch phrases louder.  And speaking of catch phrases in this album alone their are probably the most and most famous of catch phrases.  This album  makes regular rockheads hard rockheads and wannabes wannabein a lot more.  Back in Black is the ultimate for a true ACDC fan and a must for any starter.  Like alot of bands before them they had now with this album mounted their flag as true rockers for everyone to salute.  But unlike alot of other bands they stay out of the courtroom battles like so many other musicians have a problem with, they remain as brothers to each other, don't party to hard, they care about the fans and theirs shows and not about their paychecks, their noses and consciences are clean and are always trying to out-do themselves and  even though they have popularity they don't try use that to their advantage to make any outrageous statements or come up with radical ideas for people to leach onto and promote, which makes them pretty good rock role- models to say the least.  Basically when it comes down to it ACDC is all about the rock.  And that's what it's all about.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|For those of us that remember the Golden Age of political and social satire - the late '60s through late '70s - this movie a complete joy. I've read many critical reviews, finding Animal House lame compared to American Pie, etc. You can't compare them. Modern film \\"satire\\", as represented by Pie, seems to equate satire with explicit references to alchohol, drugs, genitals, excrement, and sex nearly devoid of social or political context, or anything else (Christopher Guest's work is a refreshing sanctuary from this tiring trend). Animal House writers Miller, Kenney, and Ramis never delude themselves that genital jokes in themselves are satire. For these guys, a moon shot from a passing car can be funny, having to watch the same moon for the next thirty-five miles is just a bore.<br />Perhaps you had to be there to understand the difference. Go back and read the brilliant work of Chris Miller, Doug Kenney, and Michael O'Donoghue from Nat Lamp from 1968-1979. Or find the <br />Animal House movie book (now quite rare) that provides more background (Miller's hilarious \\"Pinto Stories\\"). Then come back and opine only after you can tell us why Larry is nicknamed \\"Pinto\\".
0553573403|5.0|I'm not a regular fantasy reader, but decided to give the &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; series a try because I enjoyed Martin's &quot;Armageddon Rag&quot; so much many years ago (that book might best be described as a mystery with supernatural overtones).<br />I ended up reading all three extant volumes of Fire and Ice in a two-week marathon and may Martin and I both live long and prosper so I can read the entire series.<br />One of the things I liked about the series is precisely that there are few pure heroes or pure villains.  There are characters who are very nasty pieces of work and others who are quite good-hearted, but every one of them emerges as a person driven by complex motivations -- greed, vanity, bravery, duty, naievete, virtue, cowardice, friendship, lust, sadism, revenge...  There's not a cardboard cut-out among them, even down to the smallest bit player.  The only pure villains are a few, like the boy king Joffrey, who are sociopaths.<br />In fact, some of the most fascinating characters are those you feel you should hate but can't (Tyrion Lannister, for example).<br />Martin has also done an incredible job of realizing a world for Fire and Ice.  With the exception of the odd dragon or magic spell, nothing that happens in his world is much stranger than things that actually did happen in days of old when nights were bold.  In a funny way, it brought history alive for me in a way that no non-fiction book ever has.  And after you absorb how unpredictable and difficult life was for ordinary people while the rich and powerful played &quot;The Game of Thrones,&quot; the next obvious thought is &quot;and how much have things really changed?&quot;<br />Forget genre, this series is one of the best things I've ever read, period.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|I enjoyed this CD.  I love Eric Clapton and always will.    Clapton remains as strong, as dedicated in his blues playing as ever.  I liked &quot;From The Cradle&quot; better.  The &quot;but&quot;in my review is my surprise that he chose this material to do.  Peter Green (who replaced Clapton all those years ago with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers) with the Peter Green Splinter Group did all these songs over two albums (The Robert Johnson Songbook and Hot Foot Powder) in the past five years.  In fact, I believe he won a Grammy for the first one.  Very similar takes from two powerful players.  I would recommend this album but would strongly suggest you check out the Peter Green material.
B000055Y0X|5.0|I had seen 'Dr. Strangelove' several times prior to purchasing the Special Edition DVD, but have never enjoyed it as much. The film is the standout satire from the 1960's and possibly of all time. The film is unbelievably tightly edited and is probably Kubrick's greatest work. The single largest contribution to the success of the film is the superior casting, led by Peter Sellers in a virtuoso triple performance. Supporting Sellers are Sterling Hayden, who plays the best dark lunatic ever on film, and the brilliant George C. Scott, as General Buck Turgidson. My favorite of the smaller roles has to be that of the rather dense Colonel 'Bat' Guano, played so effectively by Keenan Wynn. Also contributing to the realism of the film were the brilliant sets which are very effective at conveying the time period and mood.  <br />The DVD has several excellent extras, including a documentary on Kubrick, and a wonderful documentary on the making of 'Dr. Strangelove'. There are also some odd interviews, and typical features like biographies, trailers (a must see!), and subtitles. <br />This movie is one of the greatest films ever made, and I can't endorse it highly enough to anyone with an eye to black comedy and satire.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|'Donnie Darko' is without a doubt one of the best films I have ever seen. It is a brilliant mix of satire, dark humour and sci-fi, founded on Kelly's fantastic dialogue and direction.  <br />The plot is based on a single question: Does everyone die alone? This chilling idea sets Donnie Darko on a quest to discover the existence of God and the idea of time travel. On his way he loses his fear of death and learns to love.  In the end it is these newfound ideas that force Donnie to make the choice between life and death.<br />The symbolic nature of the film is what makes it outstanding. There are ironic parallels with the Bible, 'Hamlet' and 'Catcher in the Rye', and Kelly uses these expertly for a director of such young years.  <br />Most importantly, the story of 'Donnie Darko' is in many ways typical of any teenager.  A defiant but bright boy struggles in a world that he cannot understand and does not understand him, until finally he finds strength in the girl he loves.  In the end, Donnie goes against the rules of time and fate wtih consequences that will never be understood by the world.  Kelly cleverly transforms adolescent indulgence into the act of a saviour.  An underrated masterpiece.
B00008EY9G|4.0|At first I thought this would be just a basic poorly scripted suspense flix.  But it was far more complex than that.  Identity is a very engaging movie that was not overly predictable.  After seeing this I went into work recommending that people see it.<br />The major annoyance I have with the film is a slight but critical blunder.  I'm used to Hollywood getting psychological diagnosis wrong.  Hollywood often plays with diagnostics for dramatic purposes.  This blunder was not an error for dramatic effect.  It was just a stupid error that should have been corrected.  If a &quot;Psychiatrist&quot; is going to state which Axis a diagnosis is on he should be able to correctly state the Axis!
6305513406|5.0|These were the first two with Captain Kirk.  I have to admitt that I own all 40 volumes.  Yet I still may get the box sets.  Each episode runs for 50 minutes.  Longer than a 45 minute episode of The Next Generation, but shorter than the unaired 63 minute pilot; The Cage.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I have to say for a bunch of songs that were scraps from other albums, I think it's their best one. The tracks have amazing continuity and the lyrics rise above the usual meathead stupidity of metal. Steal This Album has the usual power of System with the brains of political punk.<br />I would point out some highlights, but every single track is awesome. There's no need to skip tracks. <br />I have to say that System's marketing is shameful though. They claim that they put out this album because people were downloading poor quality versions... B.S. They put out this album for money, just like they release three or four versions of each album for money. They're worse than Max Cavalera when it comes to ripping off the fans. Then they call it Steal this Album as if they would really like that. Well, maybe it's more Rick Ruben's fault than it is System's.
B0000542D1|5.0|From reading the above reviews, I can determine that most of the people who wrote them are too young to remember the early to mid sixties decade when North America was introduced to these four longhairs from Liverpool.  Before these British lads crossed the pond and made their first Sunday night appearance on the tube courtesy of Ed Sullivan, the United States had been traumatized by some unfortunate events.  In October 1962, we were finally able to exhale when Mr. Khrushchev ordered his Cuba-bound missle-laden ships to turn around and go back to the USSR; thus ending any speculation about a nuclear war.  A little more than a year later, we east coast Americans had our lunch breaks interrupted and had to endure a little indigestion when the TV's and radios blurted out the news that our commander-in-chief took a few bullets to the head in Dallas.  When we were listening to our AM-only transistor radios for music, we had to settle for a superfluous amount of stale doo-wop music for entertainment.  There couldn't have been a better time for the Fab Four to present their style of moderately-reformed rock and roll to the USA. <BR>I remember seeing this movie for the first time as a Sunday afternoon matinee in a neighborhood theater.  It didn't take much for anyone to see this production was a low-budget one that required a very small amount of planning.  All this film did was present the Beatles acting as themselves living a presumed lifestyle while putting the audience in a vicarious experience of sharing that lifestyle with them.  This movie told a story without being in the form of a banal documentary.  This wasn't much of a movie, but people came in droves to see it just for a glimpse of this suddenly popular musical group.  Back then, the Beatles' popularity permeated all age groups.  I was a seven-year-old second grader when this group made their North American premiere.  Could you imagine seeing seven-year-old girls in my class jumping up and down and squealing tothe Beatles music on the radio?  Well, thanks to modern technology and new copyright laws, we can see this flick anytime we want to.  I've seen the VHS videocassette and I'll view the DVD sooner or later.  I'll be back with another review after that!
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Well...I've digested the new CD by Eric Clapton, &quot;Me &amp; Mr. Johnson&quot;, his so-called tribute to Robert Johnson.<BR> <BR>I won't rant on with a long review, but I'm shocked to hear the world's most spooky, raw blues songs rendered into a nice, suburban, Disney-safe format...as if Clapton had never even heard these songs before and is reading them off a song sheet.  One of the rare albums that gets worse the more times you listen to it...<BR> <BR>However, my take on it results in the notion that the CD's title should be changed...this should give you an idea of what I REALLY think about this.  So, rather than &quot;Me &amp; Mr. Johnson&quot;, might I suggest...<BR> <BR>&quot;Amos and Andy and Mr. Johnson&quot;<BR>&quot;Eric Clapton as Robert Johnson TONITE! - on FOX!&quot;<BR>&quot;Robert Johnson for Dummies&quot;<BR>&quot;Eric Clapton's Delta Blues Minstral Show&quot;<BR>&quot;Robert Johnson Lite - All the Tunes With None of the Blues&quot;<BR>&quot;Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Robert Johnson&quot;<BR> <BR>Buy at your own risk...
B00004XOWM|1.0|If you want rap, get Tupac.<BR>If you want metal, get Slayer.<BR>If you want rap-rock like this tries to be, get rage against the machine.<BR>Just please dont buy this cd.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is amazing and the younger audience from 8-25 can easily relate and any older people who are truly kids at heart. You can't help but love their Good Charlotte/Blink-182 inspired pop punk and there's something for everyone on this CD. I guarentee that GC/MXPX/Greenday fans will love this CD and any young punk fans as well. This CD is truly inspired and Pierre Bovier's passion for music is clear and amazing.
B00005OM4N|5.0|...i am not a crazed Brittany fan that rates anything she does 5 stars. Heck some of her songs awful. Well Anyway here is my review<br />  This is by far Britneys best work!!!! My top 3 songs on this albuum are \\"I'm a Slave 4 u\\" (A sexy song that is very r&b sounding good to dance to) \\"Overprotected\\" (A song that realates to me and has a message and beat to make you dance) \\"Boys\\" (My Favorite song, extremly sexy and dancy, Good thing they didn't use the horrible video version)<br />            Some other standouts include A more bubble gum poppish \\"I love rock 'n roll\\" And the ballad \\"i'm not a girl not yet a women\\"<br />            The worst track is \\"anticipation\\" horrible lyrics!<br />So why are you still reading this review!!! buy this!
B000094DUP|5.0|If one were to take Celine Dion's strength of voice and mix it together with the songwriting talents of Jewel and Madonna, the energy and youth of Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson, and the exceptional beauty of Shania Twain and Sarah McLachlan, one might well end up with Delta Goodrem.  <br />This rare Australian flower has created an album that stretches the limit of imagination and defies the predictability of the conventional pop album.  This is not a disc of filler songs strategically placed in between three or four songs with any real depth.  Nearly all the tracks on this album were cowritten by Delta herself and the few songs written without her were painstakingly hand selected.<br />Delta's music can be ambient, electronic, or acoustic, but no matter the instrumentation it is always a sweeping wash of sound painting stories.  Each track is intimate and true, creating an incomparable listening experience.  The music truly reflects back on its artist so that each time it is listened to the listener grows a little closer to the singer.<br />'Innocent Eyes' is as close to a perfect album as any I can imagine.  Its flavor and immaculate songwriting leave an impression much deeper than catchy stuck-in-your-head melodies.  This album is a worth-while investment.<br />Delta Goodrem is a rising star whom we can expect to burn brightly for years to come.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|For the people,  The only way you can realy like the matrix is if your a true fan.<BR>  Not just a fan of the movie but a fan of the movie stars and of all the hard work that was put into it.  Sure some of the 1star raters might be a true fan but there wrong on what they say.<BR>  Since The Matrix Revolution leaves off at the point that The Matrix Reloaded ended then its realy just 1 long movie so if you hate evolution you hate Reloaded.  Since Reloaded is set up by the events in the first film then you would hate that to.<BR>  Personaly I loved the Matrix 1,2, and 3, I even like The Animatrix, mainly because im a true fan.  The fight between Agent Smith was realy good.  So if you hate The Matrix Revolutions then you hate it all.
B00005JLYW|1.0|I loved the first movie. It was funny and absolutely entertaining. The Sequel failed on all levels. Horrible Story (was there one?)and acting. The former charming Angels were bad parodies of themselves and Demi looked great but that was it. What did they think? I hope for a 3rd installment that captures the spirit of the 1st one again and makes &quot;Full Throttle&quot; just an accident in movie making...the girls would deserve it!!!
B00000K3D4|5.0|I am 24 years old and have loved this film for the last 14 or so. I had this movie on video and would watch it over and over until I knew the entire dialogue. I even got my little neices and nephews into it and now that they are teenagers they still love it. Last night I watched it for the first time on DVD with my 4 year old daughter. She was a little bit scared at first but she couldn't take her eyes off the screen. Today she talked about how beautiful Sara looked in that white dress. I loved the special features on this DVD that showed how they made all the puppet characters. I hightly recommend that you buy this movie, if you don't like it, someone in your family will.
B00008OLYN|4.0|These guys are good, no doubt.   I am a massive fan of the scandinavian (and finish) music scene, and these guys are a foundation of that scene.  But sometimes the screaming is too much (I must be old), even though I love soilwork.   Opeth is simply steeped in the growl and suffering.  I can take one at a time, but not both.   This album though is really really good.   Still suffering, but no growl, and nice moody, atmospheric music.   Great playing and musicianship, which these guys always have, even though it is buried under the screaming and growl.<br />Maybe this is a portend of things to come, where they will actually make music with melodies and vocals
B00004Y6RO|5.0|Slipknot is the GREATEST band ever. There first self titled cd slipknot was awsome, then they came out with the digipak that has 20 songs and at the end of 20 theres a hidden song called eyore its sic as all hell. anyone thats a slipknot fan should have this cd.
B000002ADT|3.0|Generally acknowledged as the greatest jazz-album ever. That should be enough to make anyone suspicious, and I'm a suspicious bugger.<br />IMHO this album has almost everything, the finest musicians ever assembled on one single album and great songs.<BR>Well, what's the problem? It has a tendancy to be dull and boring. It lacks the spontaneity so essential for good jazz-music. Calculated and cold are words that comes to my mind.<BR>It could have something to do with the production that gives the album this almost sterile quality.
6305212112|4.0|People always find friends in weird and mysterious ways. In this movie Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) befriends Ninny Threadgood (Jessica Tandy) by a chance meeting in a nursing home. Ninny tells Kathy a story of love, friendship and mystery.She tells of Idgie Threadgood (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker). Threadgood helps Kathy understand the meaning of life and to live it to its fullest, never taking a day for granted. After talking with Ninny for a while and hearing her stories of how Idgie didn't let anyone push her around, Evelyn goes home to her husband Ed and tells him she wants them be more intimate. She starts working out, decorating the house and becomes more outgoing. Evelyn also learned that she shouldn't be afraid of sickness or dying. In the few short times that Evelyn really visited with Ninny, she learned more about how to love and accept herself. I don't think that anyone else had taught Evelyn what Ninny had. I really enjoyed watching this movie because it was an uplifting story that showed what true friendship and honesty really is. The ending of this movie really made me think because when Evelyn went to pick up Ninny at her house they talked for a while, then they walked by Ruth's grave. Evelyn picked up a freshly written card placed on the grave that was written from the &quot;bee charmer&quot; (Idgie) and looked at Ninny finally understanding who she was, Idgie Threadgood. It was a surprising ending to me because I didn't expect that Ninny was really Idgie. I would really recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about true friends who come help each other through anything.
0385504209|4.0|This book mixes fast action and suspense with interesting spiritual, ethical and moral issues without becoming too much of a `heavyweight' book.  The concept that there are interested groups after secrets suppressed for centuries, secrets that can bring down modern-day Christianity with all the possible repercussions forms a solid plot for the action. Once one has read a conventional thriller and knows `whodunnit' the book is pass&eacute;. But when it makes you think of other issues and pick up other books to explore some of the concepts raised, the book becomes more than a run-of-the-mill thriller - and this book falls in that category. Another book of fiction of note is Gore Vidal's `Julian' (about the nephew of Constantine the Great who wanted to revert to the old pagan religions from the newly established Christianity). After finishing \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" the question that lingers on is: how much is fact and how much is fiction?  For those who are interested in pursuing this, some good books to start with are Bart Ehrman's \\"Lost Christianities,\\" John Shelby Spong's \\"Born of A Woman\\" and \\"This Hebrew Lord,\\" and Marcus Borg's \\"The Heart of Christianity.\\"
B00005JLZN|4.0|With Kevin Spacey, I automatically expect good acting, but with this particular movie I think that not only was Spacey's acting exceptional but Kate Winslet pulled off a moving preformance. While the movie does take a little time to warm up to the viewer with the main plot, as the movie progresses as with the character development, there are much more twists and turns which force the viewer to question almost everyone's motives. With the exception of Gabriel Mann's character, Zack Stemmons (of which I was not too fond with), the characters were well sculpted and were sucessful with creating a specific atmosphere and causing the viewer to relate to one or more of the character traits being exposed throughout the course of the movie. Overall, I believe that this movie was full of opinion and always kept the viewer on the edge of their seat. Another Spacey success.
B00005JLT5|2.0|To the Michigan reviewer. What the heck does this mean? &quot;Or are you really that narrow-minded that nobody suffers like us?&quot; <br />I have No Clue as to what you are talking about. Be concise.<br />The movie is well acted &amp; directed. The fact that the story is true sickens me. <br />If I find the movie boring due to the pianist's lack of backbone, that is my right. I do not hold well with spineless acquiescence nor willfull brutality. <br />The mere fact that you enjoyed it seems to vilify your own sense of right and wrong. The entire movie imputes flight rather than fight. Wrong, wrong, wrong!<br />National treasure? National coward!
B00008EY9G|3.0|While I found John Cusack's acting to be quite impressive, not to mention his unique screen presence, I thought that Identity for the most part failed to live up to expectations. The &quot;twists and turns&quot; have been overdone and while the actual mood and effects of the movie were well done, it was the script that seemed to be lacking.<br />Identity offered up more then it could handle. Dont get me wrong, I do own this movie and I find it an enjoyable watch every so often, I just believe that it is not unlike the recent trend of thriller/who-done-it movies that have grown increasingly popular throughout the recent years. The characters were one dimensional and at times were so predictable it hurt, but it does keep the viewers attention and offers a few surprising moments here and there.<br />Overall the movie is s good rental but nothing special.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars DVD. finally. But remember they will probably put out another set when the third one is out on DVD. Which is slated, hopefully, for fall 2005. I know Im not waiting around for that. Not with the way Lucas seems to have extreme patience when it comes to releases.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|How ironic!!! Clapton doesn't mind copying Robert Johnson but he copy protects the CD. If you play music on your Mac or an iPod then forget about this cd. It won't work. But that's OK. The original is much better than this anyway.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I guess I should say this has some spoilers, before y'all read ahead.<br />First off, I haven't seen the DVD, this is a review of the film.<BR>The movie really doesn't deserve the level of trashing that some reviewers have given it, but it is IMHO the worst of the three films.  However, I think that all three films are good, so my saying \\"Revolutions is the worst of the three\\" is really a comment about the other two.  In effect, Revolutions serves best as a completion to Reloaded, not when standing on its own.<BR>It's important to view the movie as such, for as others have said, there are some limitations to the plot.  Bruce Spence, who was so effective in the Mad Max films, is brought in here as the Trainman but is not used effectively.  In fact, the early Matrix content in the film seems perfunctory ( although it was stated well in advance of even Reloaded's release that the third film would feature the least amount of in-Matrix running time ).  Also, the Merovingian and Persephone reappear in one scene which does not do much to justify their presence, resolving the train station plotline rather abruptly.  It feels as though there should have been about half an hour more of the Matrix ( focusing on the Trainman and Merovingian ) in the beginning of this film.  <BR>The other glaring plot shortage, if you're going to look at it that way, comes at the end, and it's already been discussed in this space.  Most people ( probably because of the misleading title \\"Revolutions\\" ) apparently went into this thing expecting to see a decisive victory against the machines, and they were disappointed.  There's talk ( in the Architect's brief appearance ) of some people being allowed to leave the Matrix, but we don't get to see it, and after all it would just be that whole messy red-goo-swabbing process we saw in the first film repeated many times over, so maybe it wasn't thought of as something really worth filming.(?) <BR>As far as those who say that this film doesn't do anything to explain the questions of the other films, consider that this film advances the idea that (in math terms) Smith = - Neo.<BR>Or, Smith = -1 * Neo.  This helps to show why Smith only grew more powerful, rather than being destroyed, after Neo became powerful.  And conversely.... (hint)<br />Something I really liked: the assault on Machine City, breaking through the Dark Cloud layer and seeing the sky the way it was meant to be seen.<BR>This movie did seem to be parroting scenes from Reloaded and the Animatrix at certain points.  The Zion Council scene, much like in the recent Star Wars films, felt like it was lifted from the previous film; the \\"Kid\\" re-uses dialogue from the Animatrix in the defense of Zion ( although I guess that makes you think of the Animatrix in context ).<BR>Another thing: there's such a thing as a homage, and when your audience is sci-fi geeks, one has to take obvious allusions to other sci-fi as something more than mere copying, right?  I'm not sure, but this film BLATANTLY rips off Dune Messiah and Dark City.  Bringing a beautiful sunrise to the Matrix would be much more relevant if, in fact, the Matrix had been dark up to that point.  But we know from evidence in the first two films ( including the Oracle's dialogue and what we've seen with our own eyes ) that there is quite obviously a programmed \\"sun\\" which makes its apparent motion through the sky of the Matrix, just another part of the simulated reality.  So what is the importance of the sunrise, except as a metaphor?
B000000WA4|5.0|hi all.  this cd is fabulous! Overall it is a rock cd, but there is much much more than that!  There are slow acoustic songs, there are metal songs, there is rock songs galore, there are catchy songs, there is even a classical piece!  There is common ground here for everyone.  This made the ultimate rolling stones top 500 albums list.  that same list included the beatles, the rolling stones, led zep, jimmy hendrix, and many other classics, so you KNOW they are good.  and, in my opinion, billy corgan has THE best voice of all time.  the smashing pumpkins were always standing out just because of his voice alone, but then you add amazing lyrics, great sounds, and endless variety...and you get my favorite band ever! do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this cd.  i promise you'll be saying to yourself &quot;i wish these guys were still together, they are so darn good, i'd see them live!&quot;
B000099T2L|3.0|This album needed time to grow on me, i wasn't feeling it at first. I think it's a good album but OVERRATED, it's not worth 5 grammy's at all.Skip this album and pick up Janet's latest &quot;Damita Jo&quot;
B000003N7G|5.0|First of all, John Coltrane is absolutely my favorite saxophonist in history.  Those who say he plays the saxonphone like a singer pinching their nose obviously have no musical experience.  I play the tenor sax and trust me, no one and I mean no one has ever reached such a smooth and melodic sound.  You seriously should try Briteny Spears if you are going to criticize how he plays. The saxophone is easy to play but tough to make as beautful as Coltrane did.  He deserves so many praises.<br />Secondly, Love Supreme is in my mind one of the greatest examples of the brilliance jazz contains. This is freedom.  Coltrane put so much emotion into this album.  His focus was God, and he proved to be divine with the sax himself.  Whether or not you may find A Love Supreme to be entertaining and listenable, there is no doubt that Coltrane truly expressed his strong emotions in his playing. I feel that the beauty A Love Supreme has is through its expression of freedom and emotion. Some might say his repetion of notes is annoying, but Coltrane used this as a release of feelings. The repetion just shows his passion for God and his for of expression. This is the album that shows Coltrane at his highest time of musicianship: passion and emotion for the notes and God.
6305327084|5.0|Ween AND Morphine are on the soundtrack.  Enough said.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Weezer is my all time favorite band, and the blud album is their best CD. I had already heard most of the songs that are included on the second disc, but I was impressed by the quality of the recordings. For those of you who haven't heard the previously unreleased tracks, they are certainly worth your money. I can't even imagine why they've waited so long to compile them and market them. The packaging of these two CDs is impressive.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I admit it, i bought the CD. It is anything but in the zone. i like the beats and the music but britney cannot sing. she is an amazing performer, she always puts on a good show and offers a lot for the stage but her singing...sucks! Shes got millions i suggest she invest in some vocal lessons
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido has hit the mark.  A number of outstanding songs - not just 1 or 2, but a number of outstanding songs.  Other CDs have so many filler sonds in to complete the album.  I often listen from start to finish this one - I highly recommend this to anyone.
0743454529|4.0|Took this book out the library yesterday and 1pm, finished it this morning at 10am.  Even though this is a &quot;typical&quot; Jodi Picoult book in formula - court scenes and surprise ending, I just love the stories this woman weaves and the insights she has.  The subject is close to my own heart, having a child with a fatal disease, and I was brought to tears many times throughout the story (have the tissues ready for the end of the book).  I would recommend it, especially if you enjoyed Picoult's other books.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This show is absolutly amazing. I went in January and immedietely went out to buy the CD. Idina Menzel has one the the most amazing voices on Broadway, and the last note in Defying Gravity will never be matched. Kristen Chenoweth also has an amazing voice, and hits notes so high it hurts. The two of them don't even need microphones because their voices are just that powerful. I happened to see it when Norbert Leo Butz was out due to a back injury, and I saw Taye Diggs in his last performance as Fiyero , who happens to be Idina Menzel's husband (I didnt figure this out until after i saw the show, and the chemistry between them threw me off bc it was so real. I would recommend this CD/show to anyone, even if you're not a Broadway fan.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I guess I came late to the party, since I didn't recognize the majority of the listed songs. I grew up with the Beatles, but I didn't follow their solo careers at all. So I was greatly surprised to find that I couldn't stop playing this DVD over and over. I liked it so much I bought the soundtrack, and like others I'm sorry that space constraints kept &quot;Lead a Horse to Water&quot; off the CD. I also didn't know who half of the artists were. Gary Brooking?, Jools Holland? Sam Brown? Well now I know. I've spent a lot of time finding out about all of the artists. This is a must own DVD for anyone that likes great music preformed by experts.
0385504209|3.0|OK, so this was my first Dan Brown book.  I thought it was well written and found the historical notes throughout the book very interesting.  I wish there was an easier way to find out for myself what is actually true, not being one to trust someone just because they put it in print. :)<br />When the plot is finally uncovered I found myself laughing out loud!  I'm not a big believer in conspiracies...do you know any group of people who can keep a secret? To say that Christianity is flawed because an artist believed Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had a child...then to go on and talk about gods &amp; goddesses, the age of pisces and aquarious...I found this so contradictory.  I just do not get people who saw this as so revolutionary!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Lost in Translation has many things going for it. The cinematography alone justifies the movie for me. The film is understated and quiet. If you have the attention span of a squirrel, then do not rent or buy this film. If you have any sense of patience, allowing a film to organically unfold, you will be rewarded.     Bill Murray is great, playing what I think is essentially himself. I think the core of the movie is his interaction with the Japanese people and culture, not the friendship/romance. The relationship with Scarlett Johanssen consists of them simply recreating together -- drinking, dancing, karaoke. Only in one scene is there any serious conversation between the two. Is there any *there* there? Not really. Johanssen doesn't have much to do, either, except mostly react to walking through Tokyo and Kyoto and staring out her hotel window.     Still, the film doesn't take any wrong turns or destroy its credibility. It is just a quiet, sweet meditative little movie. Probably the great reviews and excess hype will work against it now. People will expect too much.     And, I'm sorry, but the Japanese as depicted in this movie are just plain weird. From our point of view, inscrutable. So we have a good-natured and affectionate chuckle at their expense. Not having been to Japan, I cannot say how much the film exaggerates their strangeness. Even if this film is essentially accurate, I wonder if the Japanese themselves would be able to explain their behavior. The film does not even attempt to help us understand.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|&quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; is far and away Diane Keaton's best performance and I think that the fact she already had a Best Actress Oscar is probably just as much a factor in why she did not win for this role as the fact that the majority of Academy voters are now probably closer to Charlize Theron in age.  Just the idea that anybody could consistently upstage Jack Nicholson in scene after scene is very impressive and that is without tossing in the rather superfluous but celebrated nude scene (I mean, the scene is funny just thinking that Keaton's character is naked without having to actually see her nude).<br />Nicholson is Harry Sanborn, a notorious womanizer who tastes run exclusively to young woman.  This week that means Marin Barry (Amanda Peet) and so they head off to her family home in the Hamptons.  But before anything can happen her mother, Erica (Keaton), a famous playwright, and Aunt Zoe (Frances McDormand), a Woman Studies college professor, show up.  The initial awkwardness over the situation just moves to different levels of uneasiness as the four try to co-exist in the same house for the weekend.  Harry gets dissected by the two older women but at least gets to look forward to spending some romantic moments with Marin.  Then he has a heart attack and everything changes for not only Harry but also everybody else.<br />The point is to have Harry stay at Erica's house while he recuperates so that the two of them can be alone.  Harry's heart attack has him looking at the world and his life with different eyes, and for the first time in a long time he finds himself drawn to a woman his own age.  She deserves such attention, but Harry is not alone in his growing affection.  Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves), the doctor who treats Harry, is immediately smitten by Erica.  He has seen all of her plays, thinks she is brilliant, and has no interest in doing the math on the difference between their ages.  Erica has gone from being alone for five years to suddenly having two men vying for her attention.<br />One aspect of writer-director Nancy Meyers' script that I especially liked is that the supporting cast really stays out of the way of the two protagonists.  If anything, they make a point of staying out of the way, and none of the trite obstacles that such characters tend to throw in the way of the two potential lovers show up in this 2003 film.  When Marin gets an idea that maybe her mom and Harry are making a connection, she rushes off to break up with him.  You keep thinking Zoe is going to have something to say about all of this, but her efforts are almost exclusively non-verbal.  Harry and young Dr. Mercer never explicitly acknowledge that they are going after the same woman; the best we get are looks that speak to deeper thoughts.  Myers also avoids overplaying the idea that Erica is a playwright, although in the end the play she is writing plays a key role in the last stage of the film.<br />My only major complaint with &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; is how Meyers plays out the end game.  I really was expecting something a lot better to connect the final set of dots in this plot line.  The movie also runs over 2 hours in length and was starting to drag on in a way that tried to persuade me that maybe it was not what I thought it was going to be about and was heading towards a different ending.  Even the idea that the others were staying out of the way of Harry and Erica ends up going too far at the end of the movie as the film pretty much jumps ahead to the ending all of a sudden.<br />Nicholson is ostensibly playing himself, but that does not mean the performance is devoid of any sort of nuance or depth.  If we are getting glimpses of the &quot;real&quot; Nicholson, that is certainly worth enjoying.  McDormand is underutilized, which is usually the case when she appears in a movie, but here character is the most interesting of the bunch and you would think there are some choice moments for her on the cutting room floor but the DVD is without deleted scenes.  Reeves seem relieved to be free from the burden of being the One while Peet represents the sweet bird of youth.  But it is Keaton who provides the most memorable sequences, the best of which has to be the aria of crying she delivers as she writes her new play.  Sometimes milking something for everything it is worth is a good thing.  It will be interesting to see where Keaton goes from here, because it is going to be impossible for her to top this one.cutting room floor but the DVD is without deleted scenes.

B000085RTZ|5.0|Aside from its less-than-fantastic production, which is easy to overlook, Kamelot's Epica is a wonderful trip through a world beyond human realization.  Roy Khan's vocals, coupled with some good female vocalists, are the icing on the cake formed by great guitar work and mind-blowing musical compositions.  The opening full-length track and the last song are the best, making for a spellbinding introduction and powerful closer, while the material held within provides a listening experience that you'll want to relive over and over.  Highly recommended to fans of bands like Blind Guardian, Edguy, Iced Earth, Demons &amp; Wizards, Stratovarius, the almighty Symphony X, and other real metal artists!
0618154043|5.0|J.R.R. Tolkien's tales of Middle-Earth weren't restricted just to fantasy epic &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; His life's work was spread over hundreds of stories and invented legends -- some were compiled into &quot;The Silmarillion.&quot; But some were left over, little odd bits that make up &quot;Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-Earth.&quot;<br />Tolkien presents stories spanning Middle-Earth's history, with dragons and mythical heroes like Turin, background information on Elf queen Galadriel and her husband Celeborn, and different accounts of searches for the One Ring, including more exposition about the wizard-turned-bad Saruman and the other Istari. There are also essays about palantiri, wizards, and the family line of Elrond's mortal brother Elros. Best among these is a &quot;lost chapter&quot; where Gandalf talks to Frodo about the Dwarves.<br />This isn't a novel, or even a sort of pseudo-history like &quot;Silmarillion.&quot; It's more like a patchwork quilt of little odd bits that don't belong anywhere else. Anybody who hasn't read &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; &quot;Hobbit&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; will be hopelessly lost. But those who have read and understood those books will eat these right up -- there's plenty of info about favorite characters like Gandalf, Galadriel, and the heroes and villains from Tolkien's sprawling epics.<br />Tolkien's vivid writing is shown in its different states here -- there's the stately semi-mythic writing, and the more intimate conversational style of &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; He even dabbles briefly in first-person storytelling through the eyes of Frodo Baggins. Lots of details and ethereally evocative descriptions make it all come alive.<br />&quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; is a fill-in-the-gaps sort of book, and Tolkien's storytelling genius still shines through in this disjointed collection of essays, bits and pieces. For those hungering for more Middle-Earth.
B0000AZKPC|5.0|Since Ecliptica wasn't too easy to come by in the USA until recently, my first exposure to the fantastic Finnish bombastic power metal act Sonata Arctica was through their groundbreaking album Silence.  I still concede that Silence is their finest work, but Ecliptica comes in at a close second, and ranks up with the aforementioned SA work and Nightwish's Oceanborn as one of the pinnacle works of Finnish power metal.  Like its follow-up, Ecliptica features a healthy mix of upbeat heavy songs and emotional ballads, albeit with more serious lyrics than later works.  Tony Kakko's vocals are higher and whinier than they were on Silence, where they were about as good as power metal vocals get without being Russell Allen or Hansi Kursch, but he still delivers a memorable performance, and his voice is not anywhere near as annoying as Timo Kotipelto's.  The guitar and keyboard work is very good, especially considering that they were quite a young band at the time.  The drums and bass also deserve a nod.  If you've heard Sonata Arctica's more recent works, then get Ecliptica, especially if all you've heard is Winterheart's Guild, because Ecliptica simply blows that album clear out of the water!
078322611X|5.0|Field of Dreams is a film that embarks on our emotions like in a father/son relationship like no other film. It is my all-time favorite baseball film and one of my favorite sports films for that matter. The story isnt just about baseball, but the relationship of Kevin Costner's character and his distorted relationship he had with his father. If the teary-eyed ending doesnt leave you completly satisfied at the end of Field of Dreams, I suggest having yourself checked out. I am very pleased & proud they are releashing this special edition 15th Anniversary of the film (it's amazing that's it been that long). I will certainly be purchasing this and adding it to my collection, I think anyone who buys it will be equally satisified as I know I will be. The special features have deleted scenes, commentary, and all kinds of documentaries. Yes I know this isn't heaven, it's DVD.<br />-MMF

B00005JMJ4|2.0|My husband bought the DVD the minute it was on the store shelves because he said the reviews were good! We watched it and we both find it slow and dragging! The only reason I think he (Bill Murray) was nominated for the movie is because this is not his typical genre! Now I wish we just borrowed the DVD instead of spending $19.99 for it which I think will just be LOST IN STORAGE!
B00005JMSE|2.0|I have to admit, I went into the theater skeptical.  And I will also admit that it was better than I expected it to be, but it's plot was severely weak.  The whole seven gods of choas locked in crystal and the keys and random freaks were all rather confusing and silly.  And the best character, \\"Abe,\\" did not even get into any action after the first half of the movie, which was a great disappointment.  If you're planning on going to see it, just save your money and rent it from blockbusters or something...trust me.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|My disdain starts with the cover photo.  Give it a look.  If you're a Robert Johnson fan, you'll see what I mean.  This is more commercialized schlock from Eric Clapton.  Another in a long line of attempts at currying favor with blues listeners.  It's obvious that Eric has something else on his mind.  I think it's time he got down to whatever it is, rather than take the easy way out in order to pump out another album.  In short, this album has very little of Robert Johnson, and a whole lot of 'formula' music, designed to keep the public appeased.  I see absolutely no reason to have released this album when Robert Johnson's collected works can be heard as they were intended.
B00005K9QP|5.0|Ok, most people seem to remember Eric Clapton breaking out on this album.  Sure, that is a great reason to listen to it, his first time singing a song is here, the reason he was hailed as God etc.  Don't forget however this is John Mayall's album though.  Maybe not even his best, I think too John Mayall got tired of people associating him with just this record, and it being a Eric Clapton record.  He really deserves better than that.  I think those ones that feature Peter Green may outshine this one. (I have several Fleetwood Mac albums too, none of which feature Stevie Nicks or Lindsay Buckingham..that Live in Chicago is fantastic! Got a thick vinyl version that still plays great with just a few pops)  Great introduction to the British blues scene, and an easy one to find compared to a few others of the early 60s British blues ensembles.  One of my favorites on here has to be What I Say, the Ray Charles cover, really makes you smile, or dance even.  As for Eric, I like the Rambling on my Mind a Robert  Johnson tune, first time on record he is involved with a cover of his hero as far as I can tell.  I gave it 5 stars because I enjoy it so much, but really would have put  4 1/2 I guess.  Just didn't think it deserved just 4.  Fun thing to play on a Saturday afternoon.
0788812408|5.0|Anyway,  I have got to say that this is one of the best Disney Films.  This is Disney at it's best!  The Little Mermaid made the way for new musicals such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King.  I guarantee that EVERYONE will find something to fall in love with.  It could be the songs, Ariel, Sebastian, Flounder or Scuttle.  Visually it is delightful and the animation is so fluent.  The character design was consistent.  The songs make you want to dance and the movie makes you feel like a kid, weither you are one or you are 100.  Buy this movie, if not for yourself.  then your children, or grandchildren, nieces or nephews.  It is one that you definately want to add to your disney collection.  I am hoping that they will release the special edition dvd.....:)  Take care!
B000002BPS|5.0|through the years, the offspring have tried a number of sounds. smash was their angerier album, americana was the upbeat album and splinter was their rock/pop album. conspiracy of one was their worst album in my opinion as all the songs were exactly the same as one another. despite all the styles, ixnay on the hombre defined punk metal during it's debut. since then, bands like blink 182 try and reconstitute the style with their own lyrics and riffs, this doesn't work with me. the riffs in ixnay are some of the best i've heard, songs like &quot;me &amp; my old lady, mota, amazed, change the world are my favorites. in my opinion all the songs are fantastic, with their own blend of humor and finesse, i.e. the disclaimer that explicitly states the listener &quot;not to try any thing discussed in the album at home or at all, and if it offends him, don't listen to it&quot;.
B00006690G|4.0|Eminem is not a musician. Comparing him with one would be stupid and a waste of time. Eminem is also not just a rapper. At least not a pop-friendly rapper. (EX. Jay-Z, Nelly, or P Diddy, who just rap about how rich they are and how much they hate other rappers who are succesful.) This album has quite a few weak spots, but for every weak spot, there is an equally poignant spot to compensate. I have never come close to witnessing the raw power and emotion that can be brought to my speakers with rap. I don't even particularly like rap, save for Saul Williams. Check out HIS new album called:  Amethyst Rock Star...it will blow your mind. So in conclusion, Em is not a musician. Em is a rapper with something to get off his chest, and he should be viewed that way...and not compared to anything else.
B000060P79|5.0|The CD is just plain fun to listen to.  Being a teen you can completely relate to most of the songs.  &quot;My Alien&quot; is a really random song, but I love singing along with it.  Not all of the songs are as deep as &quot;Meet You There&quot; or &quot;Perfect&quot;, but then again I don't think that they're meant to be.  They even took songs that could've been really sad and put it to an upbeat sound.  Just like real life, you have your ups and your downs, and these songs demonstrate it so well.  I love the way the band mixed pop and punk making a unique sound that a lot of people enjoy listening to.  Sometimes I'm singing along and thinking, &quot;these lyrics just couldn't be more true&quot;, and I bet a lot of you would say the same.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|The first time I heard Fallen, it seemed to me that Sarah McLachlan had reached her best sound; and after listening the first songs of Afterglow, I definitely think she did. I loved this disc as much as i loved Surfacing. When hearing the songs of this album you can feel the smooth environment her voice brings and how she has grown as an artist. The songs are really good and I'm really enjoying this album, except that some of the lyrics are not as good as Surfacing and she should have worked more on a couple of songs that are not on par with the rest of the album. Despite those facts, this is the Sarah's album that best sounds.

B00018D44U|5.0|Since her 8-Grammy win in 2003, Norah Jones has gone on to become the world's most unlikely superstar. Her debut album \\"Come Away With Me\\" was 2003's biggest selling album around the world, shifting and unprecedented 17 million copies worldwide - quite a difference from the 10,000 Norah said she would be satisfied to sell. All this without hype or airplay - rather impressive. Her blend of laid-back melodies and soothing vocals have made her a household name and her adorable face and warmly attitude have contributed to this. She's also a woman who you feel would do no wrong. She seems like a friend to her fans - a true and humble goody girl, and we all know the public loves those.<br />Come Away With Me was released in early spring 2002 on Blue Note, a jazz label. Two years later it is still riding high in the Billboard charts, pressing down on its 110th week on the chart and close to selling 9 million copies Stateside. So it came with no surprise that the whole world's anticipation for the follow-up was nothing short of stratospheric. The album finally arrived in February 2004, \\"Feels Like Home\\" was the title, and gargantuan sales were ensured. Sure enough the album stormed to No.1 in 16 countries around the world, including the US where it shifted a staggering 1,022,000 copies in seven days - only the second album by a female artist to do so after Britney in 2000. The big question remains: does Feels Like Home live up to its predecessor?<br />The simple answer is no it does not. Come Away With Me was a landmark album, the biggest selling jazz album of all time and no doubt a classic. Every song was a beautiful composition with seductive lyrics and sweet vocals. The same can be said for Feels Like Home, but on a less grander scale. Norah certainly hasn't messed with the formula here which is very wise, but the song's don't hit you as hard as those on her debut, yet it's still a fantastic album that will grow on you. Take the first single, \\"Sunrise,\\" which opens the album. A soft and soothing beat plays melodically as Norah introduces her sunlight vocals and harmonizes the chorus to irresistible addiction. \\"What Am I To You?\\" continues this trend but adds a country twang to the verses. \\"Those Sweet Words\\" has to be one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. You could just imagine Norah out in a desert or a field with her lover and no one to bother them, as she questions him on what he said - did he say those sweet words or not?<br />\\"Carnival Town\\" is one of the most relaxing and chilled songs on the album as Norah sings of attractions in a town. It sounds strange but it's beautiful and as she sings, \\"Is it lonely?\\" you realise just how in love with this woman you really are. \\"In The Morning\\" is a much more upbeat affair in which the beat gathers pace and Norah's vocals rise and fall to the composition. Another great song. \\"Be Here To Love Me\\" has a stomping beat that works very well with Norah's vocals. She sings in a very bluesy moody about love in a country way as her vocals are drawn out more and more to make another standout. \\"Creepin' In\\" is one of the most uptempo songs on the album and features, unfortunately, Dolly Parton. Yeah, we all know Dolly's a country legend, but I really can't stand her Barbie-like vocals! No disrespect to her, but this is the worst song on the album for me. \\"Toes\\" drags the album back up on top form as Norah sings of her toes just touching the water as the piano and drums play melodically in the background. Another brilliant track.<br />\\"Humble Me\\" is the longest song on the album, in which Norah sings of giving birth to a child. The father has deserted her, and she's now all alone - she turns to God for support and he responds. This is perhaps the most beautiful song on offer here, and the way it is so relaxed and emotional makes it so. A highlight for sure. \\"Above Ground\\" is another good song, with a very jazzy chorus - very sexy. Norah's vocals are incredibly seductive at this point. \\"The Long Way Home\\" has a plodding beat to begin with and is almost acoustic when Norah is singing - if it weren't for that guitar it certainly would be! \\"The Prettiest Thing\\" is just another fabulous and melodically beautiful song in which Norah addresses the prettiest thing she ever did see. The songs seems a bit awash in the rest of these brilliant songs, but it stands out after a while. The album then closes with \\"Don't Miss You At All\\" which is very similar to \\"The Nearness Of You\\" which closes Come Away With Me. A beautiful song to close the album - I could imagine listening to it as the snow gently falls outside my window in the winter.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />Norah has recently said in a magazine article, \\"Look, I get why people like my music. It's easy to listen to. It's easy to digest. It's not offensive. I get it. It's also not genius.\\" She's spot on here. When you think about the compositions of Norah's songs, they're not exactly breaking any ground, but what they are doing is giving the public something to adore, something to treasure and something to believe in. Is there anything wrong with that? Hell no. Norah Jones is living proof that you can make simple music with basic instruments and catchy melodies. Doing it well like she does appeals to the masses and provokes a reaction in millions of listeners all over the world.

1920769005|5.0|This is quite simply one of the most sublime books I have ever read. Undeniably it is a large book, but I was devastated when it ended. From the outset this book is heavily descriptive yet in an enlightening and unpretentious fashion. The characters are well developed and highly plausible. This book is essential for everyone to read because it shows courage over adversity, strength, wisdom and the pleasures of life found in the most unexpected context. We get a realistic commentary on how a westerner managed to metamorphosise into an accepted member of a foreign culture. It has moments of conduct that we can all learn from. <BR>As the review from The Age says; 'a masterpiece'.

B00006F7S4|5.0|This is beautiful, melancholy music that makes me want to lay on the couch and just listen and think.  If that sounds terrible to you, then you probably will not like this album.<br />When I listen to Sea Change, I get chills down my spine.  This is such a striking album, and such a change from Beck's early work.  In some ways I miss that, but the new stuff is good too.<br />If I had to pick favorite tracks they would be:<br />Paper Tiger - love the bass, and bursts of strings seem to swell like sunbursts when you least expect them.  The lyrics are delicate and incredibly well-written.<br />Lost Cause - This one just seems to fit together perfectly, which is the only reason I can provide for why I like it.  It's still stuck in my head.<br />And those are just my favorites.. There are no weak songs on this cd.  It's truly a solid album, one that I will be playing for a long time.  It's worth adding to your collection.

0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown is on to something and he has done a very good job of writing an intelligent, thinking-man's action story.  In fact, he does so good a job, that many actually come away from this story with the belief that they've also read an analysis on historical documents and events (they have not).  The plot revolves around solving a murder in the Louvre that takes the protagonist on a journey around France and London, solving clues and learning about secret religious orders in pursuit of the location of the holy grail.  DaVinci Code elevates the concept of action novel to a new level.  It will get most readers to think about religions in a new way and it will potentially change the way we look at the impact of religions on the world we live by showing us the possibilities.  But let's not get carried away.  This is an exciting, well-written novel, and (for page-turning, make you think about new possibilities, well-done thinking person's action), it is on a par with Michael Crichton, Anne Rice, and others.  This book came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  Just make sure you don't try to come off like some kind of expert on religion when you're done.  Some of the concepts Brown uses to put his story together are highly disputed and not necessarily subject to verification.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have to agree with the others that believe this CD needs to be given a chance. After reading some reviews early on, I almost didn't purchase it. And then I went, &quot;Wait a minute, it's still Sarah&quot;. I was not disappointed. It is one of my current favorites and no, it is not 'Fumbling' but honestly, I don't want it to be. That CD was and is AGELESS and FABULOUS and it always brings me back to a certain place and time when I pull it out of the archive for a re-listen. But 'Afterglow' is great in a different way: it is Real, it is Now and as mentioned, it is still Sarah. I would highly recommend giving it a try.
B00004XONN|5.0|Common belief holds that OK Computer was Radiohead's finest moment. I agree. However, I feel that Radiohead had a second finest moment with the genious that is Kid A. There will be those that say that if Radiohead put out a plastic disk with poo on it, fans would still call it a work of art. That may be true for some, but not me. I happen to feel that Amnesiac felt like leftover B-sides from Kid A (although Pyramid Song is one of their best to date). This cd is so simple, yet complex. Such a difficult listen, but also one of the easiest. How to Disappear Completely is the most beautiful song they've ever done. Kid A (the song) is disturbing yet beautiful. I enter into another dimension when I listen to this cd, and not many of my cd's do that for me. Even &quot;OK&quot; doesn't, as mind-blowingly awesome as it is. But it's not just random background music, either. Surprisingly, this record is beat oriented for the most part. It sounds mostly like a drum machine, but the songs still seem to have such strong beats that drive the album along. And as crazy as this may sound, this album would not be the same without Treefingers. If I haven't convinced you yet, just listen to Idioteque, and if that doesn't do it for you, then go back to listening to Creed.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Dangit! what a great dvd! Man. What a great way to spend a few dollars! I got this one the other day from Amazon.Com and it was well worth my few dollars. Played it at 48 out of 50 volumn and I was made to rock. Anyone who has a complaint or a bad word about this one should be spanked severly by some very large women dressed all in leather and equipped with nasty bad attitudes.
B00006879E|5.0|I heard 'Harder to Breathe' on the radio... loved it.<BR>I heard 'This Love' on the radio... loved it.<BR>I bought the CD and, yep, I love it!<BR>Maroon 5 has such an odd sound to them. It's different from anything that's out there right not. All of the songs are just phenomenal. I am not even able to choose a favourite. The guys really complement one another... the band's smooth music, the lead singer's smokey voice, the lyrics.I cherish 'Songs About Jane'. It hasn't left my CD player since I got it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|One of the reviews for Let It Be - Naked had some venom and spit in it and accused Macca of being in on this big thing about wanting more money and trying to milk the Beatles legacy for every penny. Well, I have to disagree. I say to that other guy, that other reviewer, sod off! I listen to both versions of Let It Be and I can see the difference and I am pleased. I believe Paul and Ringo and George want (ed)in all their hearts to put the record straight. They have enough money to see beyond what us peasants see. They want to make history, they have made history, they want it to be accurate. Paul thought Let It be, the original one, was crap. Spector crap. So he and the other guys got in on it later and tried to make it like they originally wanted. That's it, man. Get over it! It's not some big crazy grassy knoll thing about one guy in London or the Mull of Kintyre trying to get himself another million bucks. Can you see beyond your own petty reasonings? It's about art and history and three hundred years from now.
B00000K19E|5.0|What can I say after so many reviews have been posted, except this was one of the very finest movies I have ever seen!  It ranks right with the original Star Wars Trilogy.  The special effects are breathtaking...the action kept my nerves taut throughout...the characters were magnificent--especially the terrific acting job of Laurence Fishburne.  I'm much more of a reader than a movie watcher, and boy do I ever wish this had first been a novel.  I can't believe it has taken me so long to see this movie--the instant it ended I rushed to the computer to order the 2nd and 3rd in the trilogy.  For a most memorable time, you can't go wrong with this movie.  Don't just watch it--experience it!
B0001906O0|5.0|i bought this after trying in vain for several years to replace a copy of 'breathe' and 'a chain of flowers'. even if, like me, you already own most of these songs, it is nice to have all of them in one collection.<br />the cure is one of the most musically and lyrically versatile bands ever. they have been in my personal top 5 favourite artists for more than a dozen years. anyone who is a fan should have this boxed set - enough said. :D
0671027387|3.0|somewhat predictable, but fast moving and enjoyable....I liked the book, but not as good as A&amp;D....
B0000542D2|5.0|This is no doubt the best piece of Cinema featuring a Rock n Roll Band,ever.The Black and White is vivid and clear here on DVD,and the sound is clear and well registered throughout the movie.The songs are a collection of upbeat,romantic Pop tunes<BR>that are uplifting and exciting.The Beatles capture the screen with their charm and exuberant youth.The story line is simple. A Rock N Roll Band,travelling,meeting birds(girls) and camaraderie among close friends.Seeming cliche's that are taken for all there worth,and Directed and Produced to their fullest..<BR>This is a must have for any Beatles fan or collector of Rock N Roll Cinema.

B000001ES9|4.0|this is my favorite rush album alongside fly by night,grace under pressure and moving pictures.sure the lyrics are lame but when lifeson and lee are rockin like this it makes up for the dumbass lyrics.the cd starts with finding my way{great vocals by geddy lee on this track,cool song,great way to start the album]need some love has the dumbest lyrics on the whole album but it's still a rather decent rock track.take a friend seems to be disliked by many fans but i just happen to love that song[it's my favorite track on this album,also cool drumming by john rutsey on this song}here again is a great track[this track is worth the price of the cd alone}what your doing is the low point on this disc,very poor track.in the mood is decent but nothing great.before and after is a great tune,very underrated track.working man is my second favorite song on the cd,a definite rush classic.overall this is a pretty good cd all fans of rush and 70's hard rock should own.i highly recommend it.
B000060P79|5.0|simple plan will always be the best they sing great they like to have fun and are comical and they make their songs about what every teenagers life is like!!! JUST FACE IT THEY ROCK AND YOU ARE ALL JELOUS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SOUND LIKE THEM!!!!!1
B0000AK7AB|5.0|If you aren't willing to admit that a movie with a talking pig as its star can be a great movie, you have to tell me what label to use for this wonderful and touching film.  It is special in so many ways that I have to admit it is one of my favorite films.  My kids make fun of me for it, but I don't really care.<br />I went to this movie in the theaters with no expectations beyond spending some time with my kids watching a goofy film.  And I have to admit that the first few minutes in the pig factory had me apprehensive about the motives of the film.  But when Hoggett (James Cromwell) and the pig regard each other at the fair, well, I started to be won over.  By the time Ferdinand the Duck crows like a rooster, I was with the movie 100%.  The whole look of the movie is unique.  The voices of the animals are all great and they are given fabulous lines.  Mrs. Hoggett (Magda Szubanski) is fab-u-lous as the silent farmer's ambitious and talkative wife.<br />There are so many wonderful things about the movie that I cannot name them all, but when Hoggett sings and then dances(!) for Babe to try and inspire the recovery of the pig, well, that is a great scene of all time as far as I am concerned.  Magical.  How Cromwell created and embodied this character I will never understand.  Hoggett is a perfect character for the role he is playing as the man with the taciturn outside and the off the wall inside that can see the sheep pig where his wife sees only meals.  How many lessons for life are there in that?  They are hard to number.<br />And who doesn't love Ferdinand leading Babe into the house to try and steal the alarm clock that Ferdinand sees as a threat to his life because it is a mechanical rooster.  Since he is a duck the farmer will eat he has become a rooster and now he won't even be needed as that.  The funniest bit is when, and you might miss it, all heck breaks loose later in the movie and Ferdinand says \\"Rinnggg Rinnggg\\" trying to be the mechanical rooster.<br />And not enough good things can be said for the wonderful voice Christine Cavanaugh gives to Babe.  It is perfect and thought the second movie is very good, it never reaches the perfections of this movie./>And not enough good things can be said for the wonderful voice Christine Cavanaugh gives to Babe.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Pure and simple - it's just space opera.  That's all G. Lucas ever wanted it to be.  I remember an interview in which he said, \\"Instead of doing 'Isn't it terrible what's happening to society?' movies - which is where I began - I wanted to create a movie where people could escape for two hours.\\"  (I hope I got the quote right.)<br />Individually, the movies might not be all that great (although The Empire Strikes Back stands out), the reason (IMHO) they're released as a set is because you need the whole trilogy (actually, both trilogies, but we'll have to wait for that) to see the whole story.<br />It is the ultimate fantasy/escape movie series.  It succeeds on every level in that respect.  It's not meant to be as cerebral (or as \\"If it's not incomprehensible, it's not art\\") as, say 2001: A Space Odyssey.  There's really nothing to be read into these stories.  Just sit back and enjoy the action and the special effects.  (And remember how many Oscars these movies won!  The original \\"Star Wars\\" [now \\"Star Wars IV: A New Hope]\\" was nominated for Best Picture!)<br />As for the Special Edition controversy: considering what Lucas had to work with in 1977, he literally worked miracles in optical and sound effects.  But it still wasn't what he really wanted.  With the SE, we finally got to see what Lucas fully intended from the start.  (Okay, the new crowd scenes in ESB and ROTJ looked a bit forced - no pun intended.)  If you don't like them, then stick with the old VHS versions.<br />I'm looking forward to this set.
0385504209|5.0|I am sure most of the reviews have given this book great accolades and it is not by accident because the book is that good!<br />Having recently read Deception Point (a totally excellent thriller from start to finish), by Brown it took me a little while to get into this book. It starts off a little bit slow compared to the other book, but it takes off in a new direction. It involves a treasure hunt of sorts as Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu follow ingenious clues in search one of the most famous hidden religious secrets of all time. Meanwhile, they are being pursued by the French Police (for a murder they did not commit) and a zealous religious sect that will stop at nothing to ensure that the secret is destroyed before it is revealed to the world.<br />Brown has put a lifetime of research into this well written and thought provocative story. He explains the symbolism in many of Leonardo Da Vinci's works and other famous artists throughout history including Walt Disney!<br />I am surprised that this book is not talked about like the film, &quot;Last Temptation of Christ,&quot; since a lot of what it talks about is totally different than what is being taught by the various churches.
0375703764|2.0|The writing itself is beautiful and Danielewski certainly has a great measure of talent. However, underneath the footnotes, pages containing only one phrase, secret codes, etc. is an old story that is not being told in a new way, it is just being shuffled, reorganized, and splattered across the pages. This book could have been excellent-had Danielewski actually written something original. Consequently, it comes across as pretentious, and the characters and the novel itself ultimately are like the hallway and the house- devoid of anything, really. Read it if you have too much time on your hands, too little imagination, and love cheap 'psychological' chills.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Kurosawa's Dreams consists of all his worries about the world and human beings. Since it's one of his last works, his mentality of filming &quot;the Dreams&quot; differed from films such as Seven Samurai in the zenith of his filming career. Instead of presenting the fierce fighting scenes, which he had excelled in, he put more effort into the internalized understandings of human beings, expressing naivete, confusions, struggle, losses, enthusiasm, despair, anger, fear and ultimately internal tranquility¡ªthe natural way of life. It is like a life circle.<br />If you look at Kurosawa's life, these dreams actually imply his own mentalities from childhood and youth to old. The young artist in the movie, who experienced the Crows, Mount Fuji in Red, the Weeping Ghost, and the Village of the Watermills, is himself. As a young man, Kurosawa majored in Western Art, and was greatly influenced and fascinated by Western artists such as Van go. His obsession with art at that time is obvious as &quot;he&quot; was running through the Van go's works. When I was watching the Crow, I was amazed by the setting of the scenes and his capability of shooting, making every aspect look exactly like Van go's work! Kurosawa is a truly versatile director, surely among the rare ones that have such grounded foundation in fine arts. Comparably, he is not as versed in music as in art. I'm especially amazed by his nuanced choices of color in his colored films. (I will talk about the use of color in Ran later, hopefully.) During the precarious time in Japanese history with wars and political movements, as an aspiring educated young man, who witnessed so many human disasters and stupidities, he got somewhat frustrated yet more angry. The characters in many of his &quot;dreams&quot; condemned the inhumanity brought by H-bombs and nuclear missiles¡ªthe big disaster took place in Japan during WW II. It reminds me of his other movie &quot;I Live in Fear&quot;. If we look back on his earlier movies,we can see that the main string of Kurosawa's Dreams is a retrospect of ups and downs of his life as well as a summary of many topics in his other movies. <br />In the end, Kurosawa presents to us an ideal word, out of any form of industrialization, out of any artificial intentions and religions. The world he describes in the village of watermills, a village without a name, (since names themselves are artificial), is the world that is believed in Zen¡ªa belief that was greatly influenced by Taoism (the path) originated in China believing that human beings should live in a harmony of nature and keep of mood of harmony. &quot;End the thinking (unnatural intention), end the pain,&quot; is commonly cited in Zen. This revelation of living life as its original form is where Kurosawa found his internal tranquility¡ªin peace. This is also a sincere advice from an experienced old man. The last scene, as the water wheels goes round and round, life goes on and on as an endless circle.
B00005JM02|2.0|I rented this because of all the good things I heard about it.  I loved the Toy Story movies and Monsters, Inc.  but I didn't see the big deal with this one.<br />Also, while watching this I realized that every disney cartoon or 3D animation movie, the main character only has one parent.  They either die or just aren't there.  In some there are even none.  The only movie I can think of that doesn't fit this is 101 dalmations, but that kinda had to work.
0385510438|2.0|This is the type of story you'd see on a TV news magazine show. Instead of taking a break during the story and going to a commercial in between, Grisham has to fill up space. I don't know if it was because he had to fill up pages, or because it allows him to express his own politcial views (D), but Grisham goes all out. Readers can tell that he is trying to talk about Wal-Mart and what it does coming to town (as he sees it), and he uses Vietnam to point out his feelings on Iraq. It's not enough just to point these out, he has to include the editorials and speeches in the text.<br />Why do we have to read through this? This was an interesting story, but it stretched far too long. Where was the editor when this manuscript came in? Did they just let him ramble because they know it will be a bestseller? Just stick with the story. I don't care how short it is. Maybe put two together if you have to. I enjoyed the personal impact ending, as opposed to the plot ending, which was a bit lame.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|I knew I would be thrilled with the soundtrack music, but the DVD accompanying this disc was fantastic.  It gives you a bird's eye view into Howard Shore's recording of the music on this Soundtrack at Abbey Road Studios in London.  There are also portions of the DVD with the guest musicians and singers.  It was so wonderful to see Annie Lenox recording Into the West.  She is so serene and lost in the music.  It's really a treasure to see the behind the scenes action of the creation of this masterpiece.  If you already own this soundtrack without the DVD, don't hesitate to get this copy just for the DVD.
B00009V7RF|2.0|Before the Peas released this album, there were mixed reviews about them. Reactions ranged from \\"Man, they're the most underrated rappers...\\" to \\"Their dancing is the only reason to pay attention to them.\\" I always thought they were just okay. But now that they recruited new member Stacy \\"Fergie\\" Ferguson (formerly of the group Wild Orchid) and scored a hit with \\"Where Is the Love\\", the stage was set for their new album, Elephunk.<br />This album is kind of hard to get into, though. It does have its moments like on \\"Hey Mama\\", \\"Hands Up\\", and possibly \\"Let's Get Retarded\\". Because although the Peas aren't THE dopest rappers, things work well on those songs. There are also some okay tracks on here too, like \\"Smells Like Funk\\", \\"The Boogie That Be\\", and \\"Fly Away\\". And I don't think the Papa Roach-assisted \\"Anxiety\\" is as bad as people say it is, but regardless, it neither helps nor hurts the album.<br />But then there are some songs that really could have been left behind, especially the lazy \\"Sexy\\" (that really describes Fergie, though, doesn't it?). \\"Latin Girls\\" is another one of those songs that lamely talks about love of all different women (\\"I love them Cuban girls, Mexican girls...\\" etc.), and \\"Shut Up\\" will make you want to tell them to do just that. Also, the hidden track after \\"Where Is the Love\\" really doesn't make any sense.<br />It's nice to see that the Peas are finally getting some recognition, and even nicer that their mic skills are a little better. Still, this album was a little too unfocused for me. And incidentally, what does Elephunk mean?<br />Anthony Rupert
B00000J7JO|4.0|I was never a RHCP fan until this album.  Despite a couple of irritating songs (like \\"Get On Top\\"), it's a good mix of mostly upbeat tunes spliced with mature ballads.  My faves are \\"Parallel Universe,\\" \\"Otherside,\\" and \\"This Velvet Glove,\\" and I've acquired a newfound respect for guitarist Frusciante since this release.  It's great work-out music, too.
B000000ZKD|5.0|The arrangements are outstanding, soulful, and definitely do Abbey Road justice. Quite possibly the best MG's recording made. Excellent use of overdubbing by Steve Cropper and Booker T.
B000089RVR|4.0|Why is this album so excellent? Simply because Dido takes her audience, and her artistic efforts, seriously. The lyrics are not just \\"I love you, blablabla\\", but attemps to grasp some of the more complex aspects of human emotions in an honest, uncompromising way. As a listener, I am very convinced that the words sprung from the very depths of Didos heart and soul. Musically the album covers many genres and is full of original ideas, and I think this isnt only due to \\"collaborating with the right people\\". Music, and art as such, should be dealing with subjects beyond the banal discrepancies between the sexes, and try to convey honest emotions and reflections to an audience who should expect no less. All hail Dido, shes for real.

B0000C7PRY|5.0|Being a Christian and a prog music fan (ELP, Yes, Transatlantic) I was looking forward to seeing the two blended together. What I did not expect was how deeply this album would affect me. Neal opens his past and lays it out there, demonstrating to the listener what Jesus Himself can do for any man (or woman) who is searching for purpose in their life. Those who are basing this CD on the music alone are not giving it fair credence. It's a great prog album, no doubt. The talents of the musicians are incredible (once again, Mike Portnoy shows his unbelievable percussion skills!). But the real gift of this music is all about change. Neal weaves a story that is raw and engaging. It made me cry, thinking of how God has touched my own life. I would recommend this CD set to anyone, especially those who are looking for the Truth, looking for purpose in their lives, and allowing someone who has &quot;been there and done that&quot; to show that this world is not what it is all about. Neal, thank you for your contribution to the Kingdom and for touching me in an incredibly personal way. I will be buying this album again and again for several of my friends.
B00005JMCN|4.0|it's the &quot;little engine that could&quot; movie.  well acted, well shot (the scenes with the races were amazing), and takes you right into the action.  they actaully made a horse racing movie enjoyable.  perhaps the best horse racing movie ever (eh...by default, because i cant think of another).<br />the downside: not that memorable.  doesnt really stick with you after you leave.  but well worth the watch.
B000002GVO|4.0|Hotel California is one of the greatest albums of all time, and everybody all ready knows that so Im going to tell you why this is one of the greatest albums of all time, well in my openion anyways.<br />The title track, 'Hotel California' is one of the best songs of all time, and it has one of the top 10 guitar solos of all time as well. Hotel also has one of the greatest lyrics of all time, &quot;You may check out, but you can never leave!&quot; I mean how awesome is that!?!? 'New Kid In Town' is one of my favorite Eagles songs, so that also helps the album be one of the best. 'Life In The Fast lane' was the first Eagles song I ever heard and I sill think it has one of the est guitar riffs I have ever heard in my life! 'Wasted Time' is alright, its the only song Im not extremly fond of. 'Victim Of Love' is my favorite song off of Hotel California I just love the feel to it and the whole sound and tone of it. 'Pretty Little Maids All In A Row' and 'Try And Love Again' are both great ballads. 'The Last Resort' is a really good song and the perfect one to finish off the album.<br />Hotel California would be a five star album if it were not for 'Wasted time' being such a bad song. But you may like it and that may only be my openion but who knows. All I don know is this is a great album and if you dont have it buy now you need to get it.
B00005JMSE|4.0|Okay, the other reviewers rated the movie based on guessing. I actually got to view the movie.<br />The plot goes something like this: Nazis release Hellboy who joins the good guys. 60 years later Hellboy must fight creatures created by Rasputin (the bad guy who was a part of the Nazis). That's really about it. There are other things within the movie too, but this is just the main idea.<br />I liked Hellboy, but to me it didn't comare to the likes of other recent comic movies like X-Men and Spiderman. It was okay. At least it was better than the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I liked the Hellboy character and pretty much most of the other characters. The special effects are awesome and the action scenes are pretty cool too. Some of the movie is confusing though and that one bad guy with the blades just irritated me (and his part didn't make any sense). I also wish that the fire girl and the fish man had more of a part in the movie. But, it is all okay. It is a comic movie anyway and shouldn't be taken too seriously anyway. It is a fun movie, but just a bit too lengthy.
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah's first album was a surprise hit. &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; picks up where &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; left off. Very good songs, but no stand out hit song. An overall solid album. Highly recommended for lovers of quality music.
0783225733|5.0|Everything about this movie is five-star, the direction, the cast, the story, all working together to produce the recreation of real-life high drama!<br />All the pieces of the story are tightly woven together to tell a riveting tale that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat and takes them on an emotional roller coaster.<br />This is a story that had to be retold, and a movie that had to be made!
B000002I2I|5.0|Morrison Hotel is the most bluesist album The Doors album they ever recorded if that made any since. This is also one of The Doors' best albums. Their is something for everyone on this album weather it be psycadelic, rock, or of course the good ol' blues.<br />All the songs are classics here but none of them were really hits. 'Roadhouse Blues' is a killer tune and one of the best songs The Doors ever recorded. 'Waiting On The Sun' is a killer song about the American dream as only Jim Morrison could right, its very psycadelic. My favorite song on the album is with out a doubt the killer funky rocker 'Peace Frog' this is one of their best songs and one of Robby Kreiger's best guitar solos. Robby Kreiger is with out a doubt one of the most underrated guitar players of all time! Other stand out tracks are 'Blue Sunday' and 'Ship Of Fools' both of which are killer songs. The rest of the album is amazing but these songs stick out the most to me.<br />If you are a Doors fan you will love this, this is like I said before one of their best albums, also if you love bluesy rock like The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, or Led Zeppelin then you will love this album as well, don miss out!
B0000E64TQ|5.0|This was the first album I bought when I was 8 years old, and started me on a 30 year journey of music exploration.  Amazingly, this album has stayed with me all these years, through worn-out vinyl to target double-CD to remastered CD to MFSL Cd and now, finally, to hybrid SACD.  I say finally, because without a doubt this is the definitive version of this classic.  To my ears, this is a benchmark multichannel SACD to which all others should be compared.<br />I'll skip right over the CD and SACD stereo layers and move right to a review of the 5.1 mix.  This is an extraordinary mix.  EJ's vocal is anchored in the center channel, with some bleed into the FL and FR, and unlike a lot of the early 5.1 mixes I've heard, his voice isn't overwelmed by the other speakers, but instead stands at the front of the mix just as it should.  Davey Johnstone's legendary guitar sound is given a lot of space through the fronts and surrounds, Nigel Olsson's drums are more distinct and real than previous releases and the late, great Dee Murray gives the LFE channel a work out with his fluid bass lines.  Add to that the ambient crowd noise on Bennie & the Jets and the until now indecipherable Jamaican dialogue on Jamaican Jerk-Off, and all-in-all you have a magnificent example of what 5.1 SACD can bring to the table.<br />I use this disc to show off my 5.1 system, especially for folks who are familiar with the album, and I have yet to find anyone who isn't impressed with the sound of the SACD.  Buy it!!!<br />p.s. I have the version with the bonus DVD.  It's interesting, but not worth the extra [money].  Only for the real EJ freaks like me.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles 1 isnt a greatest hits, or is it? I dont know. But either way this is a cd full of classic Beatles songs, from start to finish this is full of good songs. though some of the songs I can do without like 'Yellow Submarine' which is one of the five worst songs ever recorded, and this version of 'The Long And Winding Road' I cant stand this version it completly sucks, I do however love the version on Let It Be....Naked. Other then that this is great and it has nothing but good songs otehr wise. Any Beatles fan shouls own this, its a great introduction into The Beatles, though not as good as Srg. Pepper or Revolver, but still a good way to get into the band.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|This was a bad movie.  Plain and simple.  Reloaded was cool, the first movie rocked but this just plain sucked the big one.  There was no decent philosophical points brought up or given in the third.  I really don't see how both Reloaded and Revolutions were filmed at the same time because there was no acting, no plot, and no directing.  It was a waste of two hours that die hard fans will never get back.
B000002L68|5.0|Purple Rain is Prince at his best, his songwriting is amazing here and the songs are deliverd amazingly, but that also do to his backing band, The Revolution. Purple Rain is the greatest movie soundtrack of all time, and it is probley the best album of 1984.<br />The album starts off with one of Prince's biggest hits 'Lets Go Crazy' which is one of the funnest songs Prince ever made, and it has a cool political statement hiddin in the lyrics which makes it even better. 'Take Me With U' was a hit for Prince but it wasnt a big one, its still a great song though. 'The Beautiful Ones' is a killer ballad about how the Beautiful Ones are always the ones to hurt you. 'Computer Blue' is one of my favorite songs off Purple Rain, I dont know why its really nothing way to special but I just love it. 'Darling Nikki' is a dirty little song that only Prince could write about masterbation! 'When Doves Cry' is the best song Prince ever made, it has great lyrics and its a funk song with no bass, come on how cool is that? 'When Doves Cry' is one of the best songs of all time! 'I Would Die 4 U' is a killer love song, either that or its about Jesus, it could go either way, but anyways its a really great song, one of Princes best and biggest hits. 'Baby Im A Star' is a cool little pop song, but everytime I hear it I think of Tina Turner for some reason. The legendary ballad and title track, 'Purple Rain' is one of the greatest ballads ever written and one of Princes very best songs and the perfect track to end this amazing album.<br />Purple Rain is an album that no one should miss out on, its one of the greatest albums you will ever listen to and I can promise you that!
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Tight movie, that's all I gotta say. And people are thinkin' the ending was shallow?  THAT'S WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN! If you even know half of what's goin' on as a viewer, you can easily admire and respect not only this movie, but the whole series put to light as one of the most intelligent movies I've seen, period.
B000056NX5|4.0|I found this version of the classic story very powerful.  It contains insights which passed me by in the earlier versions.  The theatrical motif is one example. (i.e. the Herod show )<BR>    <BR>The dynamics of a crowd of followers seem more apparant<BR>than ever in this movie.  How did Jesus get caught up in a drama like this?  How was he &quot;made&quot; into the martyred messianic template of human spiritual insecurity?  <BR>Why do we continue this silly drama even today?<br />People want someone to point to and say &quot;he did it&quot; so they don't need to do it themselves.   It's the classic skipping out on responsibility. Truth matters.  The movie is full of it at so many different levels.  It is powerfully insightful into the<BR>human condition.<br />The fact that it does not represent history so much as it represents the ongoing human spiritual quest for certainty and control serves a higher purpose in my opinion.  We should learn from history rather than worship it.  <br />The historical details of Jesus will always be a murky affair but<BR> the spiritual saga is still alive within us all.<BR>This movie does a great justice to that saga while using the story of Jesus as the canvas upon which the saga is painted.<br />Why do we need a leader anyway?  We know what virtues are.<BR>We know how to live rightly.  We know what it means to treat others as we wish to be treated.  We know the truth.   Why the persistant drama?   This movie at least cracks the door on <BR>this question and lets the audience take a peek inside at<BR>our spiritual nature.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is a future classic! In my opinion Alicia Keys is a rare, rare talent. It's admirable that someone this young can make music, which is this mature. These songs have got it all - surface AND substance. Each and every song is great in its own right, but if I had to choose a couple of favorites, they would be: \\"You Don't Know My Name\\", \\"If I Ain't Got You\\", \\"So Simple\\" and \\"When You Really Love Someone\\".  Even the interlude \\"Feeling U, Feeling Me\\" sounds fantastic. Alicia Keys obviously draws on classic influences such as Stevie Wonder, Bobby Womack and Marvin Gaye.
B00008OM0N|5.0|I agree 100% with the other comments that said that the Grateful Dead are best when heard live--it's their specialty, it's what they are known for. But I strongly disagree with the comment that &quot;Truckin'&quot; is one of their &quot;best songs&quot;. Truckin' is their best-known song, their cliche hit, but by no means their best song overall. Nonethelesss, if you want to get into the music and message of the Dead, you have to get this album. I'm a person that needs a studio recording to help me get to know songs and lyrics, and this album (if you're like me) will help you out tremendously. While it does include &quot;Truckin'&quot; and &quot;Sugar Magnolia&quot;, Don't overlook the rest of this CD. Specifically, give &quot;Box of Rain&quot; a try. That's my personal favorite and I think its probably the best song I have ever heard. &quot;Box&quot; never gets old--Robert Hunter did an excellent job writing it, and Phil Lesh did an great job with the music. The lyrics can be understood by anyone and still be open to your own interpretation. Another good song on this CD is &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;. It really is an unbelievable song, and there are some excellent live versions of it if you find strong shows. I think the music from this CD is classic--and, if you enjoy the Dead's sound you'll find that this is probably one of the best albums of all time, according to the depth and familiarity of the music on it. I think that anybody can make a connection with atleast one song on American Beauty--either through its lyrics, music, or through both.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I think this album fits her most as she finally gets away from songs that suggest she still is in touch with her younger female audience.  Songs like &quot;boom boom&quot; and &quot;toxic&quot; are very good as well as a few others.  Overall a good sound but she is more of a performer than a singer or song writer.  I think this album fits her best and will complement her stage presence.  <BR>[...]
B000002J0B|5.0|This is the last Zeppelin album I liked, and it was underrated, No Quarter totally smokes Stairway to Heaven, stand out tracks &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;, &quot;The Ocean&quot;, &quot;No Quarter&quot;, &quot;Over The Hills And Far Away&quot;, buy this, it was an underrated album.
0671867369|5.0|Stephen Ambrose is the most compelling historian ever and this book is proof.  Because of this book I have read more into the 101st Airborne and actually more into WWII.  The book is magnificent from cover to cover, from page to page. If you can buy this or even borrow it, do it.  It will be a great book for decades to come.
B000002J29|5.0|Genesis has been around since a really long time but seen most of its best times in the 70s....  there have also been great changes in the group.... the biggest change being Peter leaving and Phil filling his shoes. This album contains most of Gabriel times songs ... of each which is a classic..(Including the great progressive piece Supers Ready ) all which are sung by Phil Collins who has done a lovely job of it too.. , the album also contains songs from Phil's First Genesis album as lead singer 'Trick of a Tail' <BR>       The main contents that a live album must have are good songs ... the songs should also sound a little different from the studio versions and last but still really important , the recording quality should be good ...Seconds out has all 3 of these qualities .. which makes in One of the best live performances in progressive rock history... A must buy even if you owe all these songs on studio albums.
B000005ALP|5.0|Awesome experimental debut for Butch, Tommy, and &quot;E&quot;.  I bought this album recently after seeing the Abandoned Pools in concert (Tommy is the lead singer) but hadn't heard anything off of it besides &quot;Novacaine&quot; on the radio and &quot;My Beloved Monster&quot; from Shrek.  Boy was I missing out.<br />I'm more of an 'experimental' Eels fan; albums like Beautiful Freak and Electro-shock are better in my opinion just because of the extreme diversity between songs.  From the quasi-piano balled of the title track to the pure rock and roll number &quot;Mental&quot;, E and the crew keep you guessing.  <br />Lyrically, the sardonic humor really shines here; especially on &quot;Susan's House&quot; which really paints a nice story (albeit it jumps from one place to another in a town).  E is a better ironic-writer than beck and a lot more self-deprecating and expressive (&quot;Everyday they rain down on me, flower in a hailstorm&quot;)<br />If you're in 'one of those moods' or just looking for something interesting from a very talented group of musicians, look no further than The Eels.
B000002UDD|5.0|This album did come at a time when Dave Mustaine was stoned alot. This does not mean it was totally bad though, it has some nice riffs and stuff, the songs themselves have some cool stuff in them, the production though kinda didnt live up to it.<br />1) Into the lungs of hell [instrumental]- Brilliant, short fast, alot of cool guitar work. Nice work by Jeff Young and Dave Mustaine here. 5/5<br />2) Set The World Afire - starts off with some weird music playing, and then an explosion from a bomb which leads to the opening riff. A song about Armageddon, has some cool stuff. Was at one time my favourite song on the album. Was originally entitled 'Megadeth' at one time too.  4.5/5<br />3) Anarchy in the U.K - a cover of a Sex pistols song, while others say its bad, it was also one of my faves at one time. I have lost interest in it though over the time. i would say 4/5<br />4) Mary Jane - Other people have stated below its written about a witch called Mary Jane. This is NOT TRUE. This song was written bout a guy addicted to MARIJUANA. Mary Jane = MARIJUANA. Get it? Pretty catchy stuff, the begining opener is real cool.  5/5<br />5) 502 - Not as found of this one as the rest on the album, but its oki. Some very nice guitar work, the sirens parts get annoying though, and with the crash in the middle of the song. This song is wrote about driving fast. Pretty good, but not one of the highlights of the album at all.  3.5/5 at most 4/5<br />6) In my darkest hour -  a hit did actually come from this album though, and this would be it. In my darkest hour was written DEDICATED TO CLIFF BURTON but stated by Dave Mustaine its not about Cliff Burton. This song is about a guy contemplating about suicide. Some real nice guitar on this and all. It's not one of my absolute favourite Megadeth songs, but other fans on the majority think its definately one of their best.  5/5<br />7) Liar - yes it was written about Poland who stole Dave Mustaine's guitars. Some funny lyrics, and pretty cool riffs. This is Probably my favourite song on this album. Cool opening riff and Main riff. 5/5<br />8) Hook in Mouth - I like how it starts, and i think Dave's voice is best on this song. Below one guy said his voice was worse on this, but i suppose its matter of preference. This was wrote to a certain guy whos wife told him to well lets just say, thnx to him theirs now ''parental advisory'' stickers on alot of albums. This is Dave's  protest song against that man. Some real nice guitar. and i think the singing is great. I would definately say Daves best singing is on this song (from this album at least) but one guy on here said it was the worse for his voice, so ill let u decide.  5/5<br />Overall this is a pretty good album, Production though is pretty HORRID. Still a good album, but NEVER was a Milestone in Megadeths career.<br />I would start out with some of their others first. Musically this isnt as good as their others, and the lyrics ARE *ChEESY* but entertaining, but which 80's band didnt have cheesy lyrics at times?<br />I would recommend ''Rust in Peace'' ''Peace Sells'' ''Countdown to Extinction'' and mebe even ''Killing is my business..and business is good [remastered]''
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Lucky Idina: she got to strut her stuff and demonstrate her sensational voice as Maureen in the original Rent cast, and now she gets to do the same with Wicked. (Being married to the (...) talented Taye Diggs is no drag, either.)<br />Aside from the clever, funny and very shrewd story-telling that came from the book, the leading ladies in this show were what made all the difference.  It would have been so easy for the lead actresses to be mis-matched or uneven, one over-shadowing the other to the detrement of the entire show, and yet for once the presence, voice and acting of both leads is a strong match that delivers an amazingly stunning result.<br />The depth of character offered by the author, and then brought to vivid life by the actresses, defied the normally over-polished musical forumula associated with big budget productions.  I left the theater gleeful that a show whose heart is centered around the friendship of two women was such a success.<br />I only regret that more shows don't open in San Francisco before hitting Broadway.  We rarely get to see the original cast perform in anything out here, and in this case, the original cast makes all the difference in Oz.
B000002UUX|5.0|My Favourite megadeth line-up, as well as many other fans. Marty Friedman (a virtuoso, who has done guitar work in cacaphony with jason becker) Dave mustaine, David Ellefson and Nick Menza.<br />1) Holy wars...the Punishment due - One of my faves on the album, sweet guitar, and great singing. the Lyrics also on this album are higher rate then their prevous albums if ur a lyrics fan. 5/5<br />2) Hangar 18 - best song musically on the album, 11 solo's. Pure guitar genius. This song is obviously about aliens. Most peoples favourite on the album. 5/5<br />3)Take no prisoners - cool opening riff, and lots of great lil solos everywhere. a pretty good song, not a standout among all these other great ones, but great none the less. 5/5<br />4)Five magics - cool bass!!! and awesome eerie guitar parts, very cool. 5/5 for sure.<br />5)Poison was the cure - a cool opening with some cool bass. Really good guitar as well. 5/5<br />6)Lucretia - opens up real nicely, real nice guitar and singing.5/5<br />7)Tornado of souls - great intro, this song has a real sweet solo as well. GREAT singing too! Chorus is catchy. 5/5<br />8) Dawn patrol - a lil short song about the ozone layer. Has cool bass and eerie singing by Dave mustaine. Short, and mebe simple but a good song 5/5<br />9)Rust in peace..polaris - cool begining with the drums, this song has nice guitar as well. Good singing once again. 5/5<br />This album doesnt got a bad song, and is EASILY megadeths best album musically, im not saying the others are bad. (i think they kick EXTREME arse as well) but you can tell he thought bout the music more here, and lyrics. After Megadeths ''disappointing'' album ''so far..so good..so what''. this gave the fans wat they wanted. (although ''so far, so good, so what'' wasnt that bad, i liked alot of it.)
0743454529|5.0|Yet again, Ms. Picoult puts a quality work out there.  It is getting harder and harder to pick a favorite!  Her latest release, My Sister's Keeper, presents the issue of ideal gene selection for the purpose of conceiving a child who will be a perfect donor match for a terminally ill toddler. <br />To what lengths would any of us go to save our loved one?  What if it was at the expense of another loved one? Where do we draw the line at what constitutes quality of life?<br />In fine Picoult style, Jodi builds and thickens the plot, so that, what may have started out as a cut and dry decision to us, leaves us questioning our thought process and moral position with each layer. A wonderful read that I'll be passing on to others in anticipation of some great discussions in the future.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Mona Lisa Smile is an inspiring film based on a time period when women are beginning to explore alternative roles in society other than the traditional roles of being a stay at home mother who concentrates on her husband's career and success--rather than her own.  Julia Roberts and her fellow actresses explore the roles of women as Julia plays an art professor who sets out to academically enlighten a group of already well-educated, rich girls attending a finishing school. Through this enlightening process she helps several of the students find their way, broaden their horizons, and in the process finds herself.  The movie deserves four stars because Julia's character not only lets the audience relate on a feminine level but on a humanitarian level as well.  The viewer can truly imagine the Mona Lisa smiling, if she were to watch Julia Robert's performance in this movie.
6304493681|4.0|The basic question is worth asking. Start with a world of natural and synthetic bodies, natural and synthetic thoughts, and all combinations along both axes. What percentage of each does it take for some mind in some body to be human?<br />The lead character is well placed to ask the question. She convincingly answers the question in her own case. The plot that carries her along is a man(?)-hunt in a futuristic urban landscape. For all its skyscrapers and other features, the city still has its crowded streets, banners, and open store fronts. They are part of the answer, functioning human communities in a man-made physical environment.<br />The animation was uniformly good throughout, but I found the script to have a choppy pace. There were long, leisurely canal rides between the chases and shooting, and long philosophical monologues. As long as the director chose an action movie for a vehicle, I would have preferred to see the basic questions acted out rather than spoken.<br />This anime well done, but the plot is too inconsistent for me to call it great. It's a good one, though, and I keep coming back to it.
0739313126|4.0|I listened to the unabridged version on CD, and it was fantastic.  There was never a dull moment, and the mystery of both the murders and the quest were kept just out of reach so that you were always at the edge of your seat wanting more.  Whether or not the subject of the book is even fathomable, it stimulates your mind enough to think of the possibilities and the what if's of biblical history.  It was a sort of Indiana Jones adventure that was exciting right to the end.  Lots of fun, and very enjoyable.
1582432678|3.0|This book would be more accurately titled \\"We need to talk about the Antichrist.\\" Practically from the moment of his birth, the eponymous brat is an evil, manipulative creature more ripped from a third-rate slasher flick than the headlines. It's surprising that the author bothered to craft such an intricate superstructure around such a hollow and one-dimensional character. That said, what a structure! The book, and each chapter within it, practically nails you to the page. Trains were missed, meals were skipped and calls were ignored as I sped through this book.  Too bad the payoff in each chapter is a very predictable: With a soulless monster in the house, what do you think happens to the cute pet, sweet little sister, and bottle of drain opener? In addition, the \\"surprise twist\\" will be a surprise to only a near-comatose reader and the author's sadistic embellishments to the crime at the novel's center make me worry for her mental health. Come on, Ms. Shriver, use your considerable talent to create some believable situations next time, and don't try to be Stephen King-one is enough. Now where did I put that bottle of Drano...
B0000E2FLC|2.0|You will love every opening of each song.  Everything is great <BR>until Brian Johnson starts in. Man, if he would just speak the <BR>lyrics opposed to his attempt to sing, it would greatly improve <BR>the DVD.  If he wouldn't sing at all, I'd give it 4 stars. Angus <BR>&amp; Malcolm are simply the best. I will listen to AC/DC with Bon <BR>Scot until the day I die.  If you are going to order only one<BR>AC/DC VHS/DVD, this is not it.  If you have all the others, then<BR>yes, you'll need to complete your collection with this one.
1573225517|3.0|Try your best to erase the image of John Cusak's smug and sagging mug from your mind before reading \\"High Fidelity.\\" The character of Rob is much more likeable and his conversion to domesticity is much more winning in print. (Sorry, John, the Lloyd Dobler schtick has not aged well at all.) The book's \\"soundtrack\\" such as it is also is much more substantial, heavier on classic soul and lighter on forgettable alt-pop. Britain also works better as a setting for this slight tale, as an American girl would have ditched Rob's butt years before for a better financial prospect.  <BR>Like a Stereolab cut, this book is fun for a quick spin but hardly worth downloading onto the hard drive.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Well it's about time they come out with a greatest hits cd!It's good but I was disappointed that Mr.Brownstone wasn't on it!!I mean they play that song on the radio more than some of the songs on the Cd.Or Hair of the dog,My michelle,used to love her!!!If it had those songs I would have given it 5 stars.I just wish they would get past all the crap and get back together.My words to them is stop thinking about your selfs and think about your fans!!!I saw them in 92 with metallica and they were way better than metallica!!And look metallica today still goin strong.Anyway it's a cd worth buying.
B000023VR6|5.0|Dr. Dre had an amazing career. He was in N.W.A., he invented G Funk, he discovered Snoop, Em, Hittman and many others but he's also keep doing classic solo albums. 2001 is one of them (along with Chronic).2001 is full of featurings with Dre's old (Snoop, Kurupt, Nate) and some new friends like Eminem, Xzibit and Hittman. Dre is producing this album with his magical beats with a little help of Mel-men and Finnesse (who is producing a surprise duet with Mary J. Blige on The Message). Album starts with my favorite song on the album: The Watcher. First really solo song from Dre and with an amazing beat. Goes on with the funny F*** You with Snoop and The Dude talking about which kind of a b*** they like f* with. I will stop here, but I recommend you to buy it because it is great and certainly a lot better choice than any 50 Cent or P. Diddy out there.
B000001IPL|5.0|This album is truly a gem within the punk world, especially the newer punk age full of overused themes and riffs courtesy of Blink 182 and the current infestation of similar pop-punk bands.  Even though The Offspring have driven down a more poppy road in recent years, one cannot dispute the greatness of this album.  I'll admit, it took a while to really get into this album (as well as other Offspring albums) but when it all finally clicked, it was well worth it, and the true worth of this album revealed itself.  The in-your-face songs flow very well, with Dexter Holland's incredible vocals leading the charge for Noodles' guitar work combined with great bass lines and drumwork.  From the intro to the anthem-like title track, this album is full of energy that is sure to please even the most pure of punk fans.
B00006RU5B|5.0|this album is one of my personal favorites. the guitar is not weak, the lyrics are only annoying to people who dont understand art and anyone who doesnt like this album doesnt like good music or theyre in a coma. you rage fans make me sick. that zach guy didnt even sing he just talked at the microphone. honestly, i could do what he does in my basement, anyway...did he even play an instrument?
B000063DFS|5.0|This is definitly one of the best albums of the 90s, and one of the best of Ozzy's career.  Even though it has a bit of a different flavor then from the Ozzy of the 80s, the songs on &quot;No More Tears&quot; are very solid, with several tracks (&quot;Mama I'm Coming Home&quot;, &quot;No More Tears&quot;, &quot;Mr. Tinkertrain&quot;) rivaling the classics of the early days.  Definitly a must have for Ozzy and rock fans alike.
B000084T18|1.0|Wow this is crap. Cant believe I wasted my money on this. His lyrics are really bad. His rap is bad. The beats are bad. This whole cd is bad. I suggest you dont buy this cd. It isnt worth it. Im glad this album didnt win any Grammys.
B000002B7O|5.0|Arguably Ozzy's best album of the 80s (maybe his best yet?), &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; is definitly superior to it's predecessor (though Blizzard is still a good album) with a higher quantity of good songs as well as improvement in the music.  There is not one bad song on this album (which is something I cannot say about most albums).  If there is any gripes I have with this album, it's that there aren't enough songs on it in general.  Oh well, 8 great songs is better then none.
B000089RV6|5.0|ok now this is proff that ac/dc is the hardest rocking band that blows your mind.this album is a follow up to &quot;highway to hell&quot; and that album featured bon scott on vocals,but when he died in febuary 1980,brian johnson took over his vocal duties,he sounds awesome in the studio but when he sings live,to me i think its kinda a cheesy when he sings live.the opener of this album starts off with the best ac/dc song hells bells which is a good way to start the album.and the rest of this album is just excellent songs like &quot;you shook me all night long,let me put my love into you,shake a leg etc.,this is definitly worth having in your collection,so if ya dont have it get it.....NOW!!!!.<br />p.s. if you go to the see more about me page and you see that i only reveiw metal albums and have LOTS of five star ratings.just to say i only do reviews i enjoy.i dont do one star reviews cause when i do that i feel like bashing people and i dont like to do that.
B000002B7M|4.0|Simply put, Blizzard of Ozz is a good, solid album...but a bit overrated.  Tracks like &quot;Crazy Train&quot;, &quot;I Don't Know&quot; and &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; are smashing rock n' roll classics, while &quot;Dee&quot; and &quot;No Bone Movies&quot; (the two weak tracks of the album) are forgettable tracks.  Like I said, a good solid album, and by no means should be passed up especially if you are a fan of Ozzy.  It's just a bit overrated.
B000063DIR|5.0|ok so now this is sadly ozzys last album with guitar god randy rhoads(it really sucks i know and R.I.P. randy).so now lots of people say that this re-recorded drum and bass album sucks,well i didnt listen to the original,so instead of wasting my time finding a used copy of it, i bought the re-recorded version.but i think its just perfect,if it didnt have randy rhoads in it i wouldve said this sucked A LOT.but this has randy in it,and if you dont beleive me that randy isnt the best guitar player in the world,wel this album and blizzard of ozz is proff.so if you have listened to the ols version of this album i suggest ya wouldnt get this cause to you you probly think it sucks.if ya hadent listened to the old version,buy this insted and youll think its perfect.
B000060P79|1.0|Instead of focusing on the genre, or the genre it isn't, let's focus on the integrity of the music itself.<br />I was first introduced to this group through the song &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot;.  I then heard &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;I'm Just a Kid&quot;, and assumed this album would be promising.  Sadly, it isn't any different then from the typical pop-punk groups out there.  There simply is no originality in the music with the same riffs used over and over.  The messages found in the lyrics are beaten to death with a nailbat which only helps to drive this album six feet under and then some.  Many people seem to like this group the same reason they like New Found Glory or Good Charlotte: The members are &quot;cute&quot;.  If they would overlook this narrow minded way of seeing a band, some might realize these guys as well as 90% of other pop-punk acts out there do not bring anything new or exciting to the world of music.  You want a pop-punk group with good music?  Buzzcocks and Allister will do the trick.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Sometimes it won't take long to recognize a classic.<BR>After listening through \\"Elephant\\" once, I knew it. You could have it at that.<BR>But really, \\"Elephant\\" was allready a classic before it's release. It became somewhat obvious when The White Stripes' live shows kicked greater and greater sparks and their aura slowly grew mega-sized.<BR>In fact, you could say allready on their very first albums that, in a little while, this dead-cool duo will be a classic installment due to a classic rock album called \\"Elephant\\".<br />And here we are then, with a blood-red, gorgeous album created with passion, intelligence, wit and produced in the same way. The album's flag \\"Seven Nation Army\\" is of course a classic as well, slick and easily recognizable, still heavy and moves deep and high like a rollercoaster. It sounds bloody amazing, The White Stripes almost capture \\"The Wild Mercury Sound\\".<BR>You get the same reaction from irresistables such as \\"Ball and Biscuit\\", done with a serious knowledge and feel for classic rock and blues music, dazzling \\"The Hardest Button To Button\\", effectivly 'chilly' \\"In the Cold, Cold Night\\" and of course the incredibly sexy cover of \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\".<BR>Your avarage garage-numbers are fired off like violent firecrackers, way better than most The Somethings can accomplish, and some more \\"advanced\\" rocks like wonderful \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" (complete with a fabulous Beatlesish break) - fill this vein with blood.<br />You get the same feeling from 'Revolver', 'Exile on Main Street', 'Blonde on Blonde', 'If You Want Blood...' or '(What's The Story) Morning Glory'<BR>'Elephant' is made in a state of mind that cannot be captured again, produced with angelwings and created by trying to revive static visions, do your utter most and come up with something unique.<BR>Of course, classics take time to bloom. In ten years it will have a five-star rating. Until then, we just have to wait for the next White Stripes album...
1400034779|5.0|This is the first book that I have read by this author but it won't be my last.  This is a throughly delightful yarn about a African woman who steps out on her own in a nation where a woman enterpreneur is a rarity. The author has done an admirable job of telling an engaging tale while giving the reader a true-to-life picture of southern African. This book made me long to visit the land I grew up in again.
B000092ZYX|4.0|What is great about all of the Radiohead albums is that they all have a very different sound, and each have their own distinctive identity - and &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; is the no exception.<br />After months of listening to the album (it has been 10 mos. now) nearly every day, and at least once a week - it still unveils new things to me. Yorke is an exceptional songwriter. He has a great ability to get to the core emotion of any situation, doing so with oblique lyrics and references. Sometimes rich, sometimes simple - but in essence emblematic of the &quot;human condition&quot;, at least how he sees it. From Orwell, Martin Amis and Anthony Burgess to the Old Testament - from children's cartoon characters to Jonathan Swift. Yorke makes reference to that from which our civilization has been built - in all of its magnificence and ugliness, it's potential to do wondrous things, but also to horrify.<br />The album opens with &quot;2+2=5&quot; - and is the most direct assessment of an indifferent public that stands idle as things are being done &quot;in their name&quot; - and perfectly captures the frustration of someone who knows that a difference can be made. &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up&quot; describes an Orwellian nightmare of monotony and apathy, and then avalanches into the rain and flood straight from Genesis. &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot;, with it's gentle guitars and delicate piano motif, suggests a parting of the clouds, and Yorke sings to his son Noah his hope he can assume an optimism he's already lost. An incredible 3 song suite.<br />And then &quot;Backdrifts&quot; sends us right back to the importance of acting upon our beliefs - even against all odds, or if there's nothing left to lose. &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; again revisits an apathetic public who doesn't know that they can &quot;tie Gulliver down&quot;, and &quot;Where I End...&quot; refers to Amis' Species grief as Yorke says from the otherworld: &quot;And I'm sorry for us...&quot;<br />The album goeson and on with these extraordinary references - and a general feeling of un-ease. The music perfectly suits the angst of the lyrics - and it is Radiohead's most bitter and visceral album.<br />Radiohead, to me, has always articulated humanity's tendency of putting faith in other people, beliefs and institutions that don't quite meet our expectations. They are able to describe (both musically and lyrically) our aspirations and hope, as much as our disappointments. This album is a must have.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This cd kicks some MAJOR ASS, its one of those rare albums that after you listen to it, you're wrecked phsyiscally. I love songs on this album sucha as &quot;One Armed Scissor&quot; and espeacially &quot;Pattern Against the USer&quot;. This cd delivers a great mixture of Radiohead, Strokes, Smashing Pumpkins and much more into an original, milestone Screamo cd. This cd is classic, and take it from me, this s a worth buy. GET IT!
B000067J1Y|5.0|Hot Shots is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Charlie Sheen is okay, but in my opinion, the real comic here is Lloyd Bridges, playing Admiral Benson. Of course there are many other funny characters including the wall-eyed vision Washout. If you like movies with stupid humor, this is a must see.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I'm not going to write down reasons why GNR is one of the greatest Rock Band of all time, no this review is just something from which you will hopefully decide whether or not to buy the CD, lets get to it then.<br /> Visually:<BR> This CD is beautiful.  Its one of those cases you're proud to display.  It is a sleek two fold paper case which on the outside is silver, featuring one picture of the band, and a great one of Axl and Slash, both in silver and white.  Underneath the CD is a full colour picture of the band from Appetite for Destruction.<BR> The CD cover itself is really cool, but I won't spoil that surprise, you'll have to buy it to see it.<br /> Audio:<BR> I compared these tracks with their original counterparts and have to say that they sound great.  They are sharper and crisper.  The music it self really gets through a lot better without the interference.  This is more evident on the Appetite for Destruction tracks.<BR> Ah but is this a reason to buy it you ask?  Well, a CD housing their biggest hits all together, and having those hits sound sharper and cleaner sounds like a pretty good reason to me.  Even if you aren't fussy about music, most of you will notice the difference, especially on higher end stereos.  The better sound really lets you enjoy them more, and its all of their hits too!<br /> Track Listing:<BR> Yes, it does include their big hits, however I was not completely satisfied.  I suppose they wanted to include songs from each album, this is the only reason I could find as to why \\"Ain't it Fun\\" and \\"Since I Don't Have You\\" were picked over some of their lesser known masterpieces.  <BR> In my mind and, as I have read, many other fan's minds, their emotional roller coaster \\"Estranged\\" belongs on a GNR Greatest Hits album, period.<BR> There are also several other songs that could have easily gone on, \\"Breakdown\\", \\"Night Train\\" or \\"So Fine\\".  And while having a previously non released song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is nice, it shouldn't take up space from their other hits, since this is a Greatest Hits Album.<BR> Don't get me wrong, the first 11 (out of 14) songs are their best songs (except that Estranged should be one of them) however I have to ask why the three final songs, (which are all covers) are there instead of some of their other more deserving, and simply better, songs (that they wrote).  That's all I will say about that.<br /> Song Reviews:<BR> As far as song reviews I didn't feel it necessary, if you are a fan and have heard their songs then there is nothing I need to tell you, if you are someone who isn't to familiar with them but wants to be, then stop reading now and go buy the CD, because that is the best way to do it.<br /> Conclusion:<BR> The final negative thing I would like to say is that I would have liked to have an accompanying booklet, maybe talking about the band, the songs etc.  <br /> To sum it all up this is a great buy.  This CD has all of their hits, in a very nice order so you can just let it play.  Every song on this CD (save for the last three) is an amazing song, and you will love them.  The songs are also re-mastered and sound fantastic.  It all comes in a kick @$$ package too.<br /> Basically any CD which carries this many great songs, in wonderfully redone quality deserves to be bought.<br />Have a nice day.<br />PS This will also show anyone unfamiliar with GNR who the true Guns and Roses are, so they don't confuse the true band with the new band (save for Dizzy) Axl has formed with the same name.
B000002JSP|4.0|In Through The Out Door is a very interesting and diverse album. The use of synthesizer is very prevelant on this album. All the songs are pretty good, listenable songs. Carouselambra is probably some of the strangest eleven minutes of music you'll ever listen too. The rest of the songs aren't too shabby, including the best on the album, In The Evening, and All My Love. All in all, if you're into Zeppelin, this album is worth the money.
B00005JMSE|4.0|Yes, the critics panned it of course (what else is new - \\"Lost in Translation\\" - an ode to boredom, they like? go figure.) but there is a lot to like about Hellboy.<br />  Based on the great comic by Mike Mignola, Hellboy is a very eccentric story of a demon raised as a human and trained to hunt down \\"things that go bump in the night\\" by his surrogate father. His father and partner, a fish-man called Abe (the actor who played Abe did a GREAT job), work for the B.P.R.D. - The Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.<br />  The movie sort of merges two stories from the comics: the very first Hellboy graphic novel that details Hellboy's origin, and \\"The Conqueror Worm\\" - where Nazis try to take over the world, again. Together with Abe, his new human partner, and Liz Sherman - a pyrokenetic, Hellboy takes on supernatural baddies and evil Nazi mystics.<br />  I enjoyed watching this film, I was'nt expecting much since I thought bringing Mignola's multi-faceted comic to the screen would be impossible. Ron Perlman is a perfect Hellboy! del Toro, who directed the great \\"Blade\\" films, did a good job with this film as well. It was funny in the right spots without destroying the appropriately macabre atmosphere. The special effects and the fight scenes are great. BUT I would have liked to have seen some of the other B.P.R.D. characters in this film, like the Homunculus.<br />  Hellboy is not perfect, but it is not a bad film. I heard one critic state on the radio that he could not follow the story and that he did not know who \\"Rasputin\\" was... Hellboy was to complex for him - WOW. Yeah, people who don't know anything about history, will be confused by Hellboy. The comic and the movie contain many historical and gothic horror literature references.<br /> Go see it.
B000089RV6|5.0|After the death of their former frontman, Bon Scott, AC/DC came exploding onto the music scene again very quickly with the first album featuring Brian Johnson. \\"Back in Black\\" is arguably one of their best albums. The transition from Scott to Johnson was smooth, because you learn to love both of them with their raspy voices. All the songs on this album are excellent and worth the money. The new release features an excellent booklet full of detailed info about the band. This album is definitely worth the money, and is one of AC/DC's best of all time.
B00008NRL8|5.0|By now you probably know that the Gotan Project is a fusion of electronica and tango (\\"gotan\\" is \\"tango\\" rearranged).  I have no exposure to tango music, nor was I specifically looking for such.  Instead, I was in search of downtempo, lounge-type music and accidentally stumbled across La Revancha del Tango.  What a CD!  I love all 10 tracks.  There's a fair amount of bass beats, but the tempo is mostly slow (I assume this is tango).  Not many vocals are found (but are in Spanish) and there's some vocal samples which I can't identify...but it doesn't matter; it's the sound and the mood which are entirely sexy and addictive.  I listen to this CD all the time now.<br />One surprise is the cover of Frank Zappa's \\"Chunga's Revenge.\\"  Yes, it's Zappa and somehow it works!<br />The bonus disc has some remixes that are a bit too fast for my current interest in downtempo music and not as good as the originals on disc 1, IMO.  However, the video for \\"Santa Maria\\" on the bonus disc is really great.  It's very sexy and stylish, just like GP's music.  Shot in B&W w/ an obvious lean towards cubism and patterns, it puts a smile on your face.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The Matrix Revolutions was definately a good movie that kept you thinking.  After seeing the first movie, I expected alot more from Matrix Revolutions though.  The first movie was such a hit that Matrix Revolutions was rushed and could have been alot better.  Not to talk badly about a good movie, it just could have been alot better.  As far as the widescreen edition goes, I hate it.  Why buy a big T.V. and have a DVD that isn't going to cover the whole thing?
B000000OA6|5.0|innuendo is queen at their classic best, think anato or sheer heart attack in excellence.  i'm going slightly mad remindes me of a 1991 version of killer Queen. &quot;these are the days of our lives,&quot; is one of the best ballads they had. to &quot;all the gods people,&quot; to one of Queen's best &quot;the show must go on,&quot; this album makes you wonder what would have been. Even the weaker &quot;dililah,&quot; is good fun and find myself singin along to it. All in all this is one of Queens best, it would have been a great album to put out in the news of the world era and jazz.
B000002B35|4.0|I'm not a fan of THE DIVISION BELL by a long shot. A few good songs on an hour-plus long album just doesn't cut it, even if it does complete my Pink Floyd Studio album collection. But the DIVISION BELL tour, as captured on this CD set, must have been a sight to behold. True, it does contain &quot;Keep Talking&quot; and &quot;What Do You Want From Me,&quot; which I hate, but overall it's a terrific album. <br />The version of &quot;Shine On&quot; is fantastic and almost makes me wish Dave had handled the vocals on the original. &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; is an okay version, but the UMMAGUMMA live version is much better. I really like the versions of &quot;Hey You&quot; and &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part II).&quot; Whoever handled Roger's vocals on &quot;Hey You&quot; was very good.<br />The live version of DARK SIDE OF THE MOON on Disk Two is fantastic. I like the version of &quot;Speak to Me&quot; very much. It was nice to have it actually building suspense. The album version was too short, really. &quot;Great Gig in The Sky&quot; is a great version as well. Whichever 'woo-woo' girl handled the second portion of it was better than the original singer. &quot;Money&quot;s breakdown section was pretty good. My only problem with this version is &quot;Any Colour You Like.&quot; The album version is one of my favorite instrumentals, but the version contained here is fairly boring. I've heard bootlegs from other shows of the tour, and I wish they had used a different date's version. Dave handles &quot;Brain Damage/Eclipse&quot; fairly well, but Roger is missed.<br />The encores are pretty good versions of &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;Run Like Hell.&quot; True, Roger's vocals are SORELY missed from the latter two, but the instrumentations make up fairly well for it. &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; is hypnotic here.<br />Buy this. Nevermind THE DIVISION BELL or the other Floyd Mach III live album, DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER. This is the one to get.
B00018D44U|1.0|I can't believe anyone likes Norah Jones! Her voice is much like Dido's, and her music may be soothing and jazzy, but her voice is like a cat scratching its nails on a black board, raw and untrained just like Dido's. Please turn back and don't waste your money!
B00009V7RF|1.0|I'd never heard of BEP before I picked up this album, but a friend of me assured me that it was good, quality, intelligent hip-hop aimed at a thinking audience.  Now, I love hip-hop, but I really cannot stand the whole dumb-hop thing that's been happening in the past few years, with &quot;gangsta&quot; rappers spewing out mysogyny and homophobia over mediocre beats.  I was longing for something a bit more sophisticated and intelligent, and it seemed that the BEP would feed my hunger.<br />Sadly, it was not to be.  While the overt racism and distasteful themes that are plaguing North American hip-hop are thankfully gone, there's precious little else here.  A bunch of bland, soulless tunes somewhere in the ephemeral territory between hip-hop, R&amp;B, and funk is all that's presented here.  I don't think I actually liked a single song from the album.  &quot;Where's The Love&quot; is especially bad, some of the most horribly clichéd lyrics I've ever heard, with the group doing their best to imitate post-Beatles John Lennon's mellow vibes.  It doesn't work.  The gag has been done a million times before, but &quot;Shut Up&quot; is probably one of the most appropriate song titles that BEP could have used.  Yes, please BEP, shut up, and don't speak again until you actually have something intelligent to say.
0783240236|3.0|Okay, difinitive Hitchcock.  Fair enough.  But, this movie was far too drawn out and slow-paced to simply have the people drive away at the end of the movie and not solve the situation.  What happened to the birds and the rest of the people that lived in the town?  That's what I would like to know.  I might have given this movie a higher rating, but the ending, and the way it just left me hanging, was disappointing.
B0000019PA|5.0|This record is absolute perfection.  It's heartfelt, melancholy, and genuine.  It's not for everybody, but maybe those who can't appreciate the sheer depth of songwriting talent here would much prefer some Nickelback or Three Doors Down.  Jeff Mangum's voice is unconventional, but I can't imagine it being sung by anyone else, if you put a good &quot;textbook&quot; singer into &quot;Oh Comely&quot;, the song would collapse like a house of cards.<br />If you haven't heard this band, do yourself a favour and check them out NOW.
B0000524CY|2.0|Frankly, I think this movie is overrated.  I didn't think it was horrible, but I thought it was really slow, and totally based around shock, vulgarity, and disgust, and not around an interesting plot.  To each their own I guess, but I don't see what all of the hype is about.  I personally think The Omen is a much better movie than this, but hey, just my opinion.
0060987464|5.0|This is an absolute wonderful book.  It's one of those books your can't put down, just wonderful.  You do not (as many people dont know) need to be a Manson fan to read this or even to enjoy it.  It tells you some of his most private details of his life, and in such great wording.  <br />The reason why people would not [like] this book, is because they are judgemental, people look at Manson and assume hes a stupid rocker, they judge him by his image, which is wrong.  He is one of the few artists that actually have something to say, and isnt afraid to say it.<br />But back to the book: words cant describe how awesome it is, it tells the story of his chilhood, his fight against [certain] people, how he overcame it and his triumphs.  And it comes with some very cool color photos.  So i highly encourage ANYONE to buy this book, its art.
0671027344|5.0|I absoulutely loved every minute of reading this book. This is about a boy name Charlie who the reader finds out very early in the story is a bit different than most teenage boys.  I don't want to give a lot away but he is a very emotional person and cries a lot sometimes for no apparent reason.  Stephen Chbosky is a wonderful author in the sense that his writting style is so different than any other books I have ever read.  If you are looking for a great book that is out of the norm, read this book.  I loved this book because I am around Charlie's age and it gave me a glimpse at what boys are thinking at this age.  It's also got a suprise ending which is always great to have in any book and or movie.  One of the best parts of this books is it is open to inerpretation meaning a lot about it is left to the reader's imagination because the author doesn't give details on some things which makes it even more thrilling.  If you are looking for a coming of age story but one that is very unique than all the others, read this book and I promise you that you will not be disapointed.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I love this CD! I first heard Jet perform on SNL when Elijah Wood hosted and I loved them!  I wouldn't stop talking about them so my mom got me the CD.  It's by far my favorite CD I own.  If you like Rock and Roll, you'll love Jet!  They know how to play Real Rock and Roll!
0140288503|4.0|One would think that the US military would not be a fan of this book, since it covers a costly incursion of American Special Forces. Curiously, the military has embraced Black Hawk Down, eager to learn more about what went right and what went wrong in Modadishu. Through Vietnam-haunted movies, many people think of the military as incompetent, arrogant, stupid or just cold-blooded. Black Hawk Down's greatest contribution is a rebuke of those qualities.<br />The book follows the lives of the men who went into Somolia with the goal of capturing Warlord Aidid. Politics and why's are just briefly presented; Bowden focuses on the soldiers as they fight their way home through the city. He portrays them as real and human people, the fighting spirits of America. These are husbands, sons, brothers and friends - Bowden stresses that fact above all else. They are not perfect. Somolian perspective is given a voice in the book, but the soldiers are the main point of view. <br />Bowden said that he wanted to document the battle in the manner of a novel. He reports on the event like a journalist with an even hand. The city and the people are real and tangible, given dimensions that the movie fails to capture. The sheer amount of soldiers involved can be confusing at times, but Bowden does the best that can be done with it. The afterword presents the author's thoughts on the event and its repercussions, but at no time does he judge the actions of the soldiers on the ground. If you want to see the realities facing America and her military in the 21st Century, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B000002UDB|5.0|Women and queens grab this now!!!<br />This is a Cd for a lifetime. Where was I living. Well, here's what happened when I first heard it in the 70s. I got into the car with a stranger who got me hooked. I'm like whoa!!! Where are we going with this dude. He goes nowhere just about for a spin. And it turns out he's an authentic Brit. <br />I says \\"Is this Beatles?\\". He says yes, and stop being so asthmatic. And I'm like, \\"This is awesome, man\\". He goes, come off it you silly Paki, and stop gyrating those hips\\". I said, \\"This rocks man\\". <br />This is what was playing in McCartney's brash but sweet( is that sayable) voice( he looks so sweet you wouldn't think he could brash it up without needing some serious laryngoscopy later).<br />Mister city p'liceman <BR>sitting pretty little p'liceman in a row. <BR>See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, <BR>see how they run....<br />Gad,  they were really into the uniform fetish. Oh, loveable Beattles. Hear them, jack em up way him. Seriously, the numbers on this Cd are all the best of them: Magical Mystery Tour, Strawberry Fields, I'm the Walrus. That last one is spacy...man, how did they come up with those words \\"Sitting on a cornflake/ Waiting for the van to come...etc. I love it...so will you especially if The Beattles is your genre.
B0001XWV0S|5.0|I saw road trip and old school, and when I saw Eurotrip I was hooked. It made laugh loud and I thought to myself I'm going to buy it when it came out on Dvd, because it really excited me to see crazy kids doing crazy things and I loved every minute of it. So go get it and feel good about it.
B000002GVZ|5.0|carly Simon enjoyed success in the early/mid 70's as part of the singer/songwriter movement along with the likes of Carole King, James Taylor, and Joni Mitchell. This album captures her most familiar material quite decently. &quot;You're So Vain&quot; is instantly recognizable *and was incidently sampled by Janet Jackson for her 2001 hit &quot;Son of A Gun.&quot;* It's a clever piece of pop songwriting if ever there was one. &quot;You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you!&quot; Classic! A personal favorite of mine is the melancholy &quot;I Haven't Got Time For the Pain&quot; which was another big hit for her. &quot;Anticipation&quot; is another great addition and another classic *infamous for its ketchup connection!* I also enjoy &quot;That's the Way i've Always Heard...&quot; The only track I really do not care for is &quot;Attitude Dancing.&quot; <br />This is a great collection for any fan of Carly or the singer/songwriter movement period.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I think this movie is as negatively reviewed as it as, at least by the overall rating it got here, is because a lot of people DID NOT understand it.
B00005AFVR|5.0|I have read the reviews and for the most part they are very good. I'm giving this CD 5 stars on the basis of one song. I think &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot; on this CD is one of the most beautiful country songs I have ever heard..... PERFECT.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|The storyline for this refreshingly delightful and enjoyable film is quite a nice change of pace. People of a certain age falling in love with someone of or around the right age. The older guy/younger woman thing is turned on it's ear in this film, which was written by Nancy Meyers, she who previously gave us, with her ex-husband Charles, \\"What Women Want\\", \\"Baby Boom\\", and both of the \\"Father Of Th Bride\\" films. Jack Nicholson stars as Harry Sanborn, a 63 year old a socialite who owns ten companies and the second biggest hip hop label. He is famous for being a bachelor, a man who seems to not date women over 30. His latest conquest is Marin, played by Amanda Peet. The two plan on a weekend getaway at her mom's beach house in the Hamptons. Lo and behold, mom, Erica, comes home and everything turns topsy turvy when Harry suffers a heart attack and ends up stayig with Erica while he gets better. What happens is a man coming to realize that he can love, and be attracted to, an older woman. Diane Keaton, who is radiant in this film, is just a treasure. At 57, although it is never made clear of her character's age, since it is only mentioned that she is over 50, she is who she is and is happy with it. She is so wonderful in this film, and she lights up every moment she is in. Thankfully, she is in almost every frame. She has also never looked better. I am young, and I can see where someone younger like Keanu's character(who is a lot older than me)would fall for someone older like Keaton. She gives out such an adorable charm and strong personality, that it would be easy to see why she would be the target of two men. Complicating matters is Keanu Reeves, who plays Harry's young doctor who has designs on Ms. Keaton himself. Amanda Peet, and Frances McDormand, who plays Keaton's sister, do well, but they(especially McDormand)fall out of the loop not long into the film. Nicholson is Nicholson. He is a master and he does what he does with the charm and finesse we would expect.Our two leads are what make this film work. It is solidly written with an intelligent hand and our two stars make it rise to another level that it would never of achieved if it were into someone elses' hands. The dialogue is sharp and the banter between the two is top of the line. The movie does get a little overdone once it starts to reach the 2 hour mark. It is a tad long and could of easily of wrapped up sooner than it did. Still, it does not mar what it is a warm and hilarious and romantic film. The movie is beautifully shot. It has a very warm, serene like look and feel to it. Some of the plot turns and outcomes can be expected and seen long before it happens, but it doesn't diminish the effect or the outcome at all. It is a movie that shows that age means nothing when it comes to love and it can come and surprise you when you least expect it. Snd sometimes, that's when it's the best.
B0000AM6LY|4.0|Who neads the big bad record labels to produce and sell a great record these days ? Not SIMPLY RED, thats for sure. HOME has charted on the BILLBOARD INDY ALBUM charts for 30 + weeks and thus far has spawned 3 big hits:<br />SUNRISE a midtempo dance song which samples HALL & OATES I CANT GO FOR THAT was a #1 dance hit, a #5 Billboard Adult Contemporary hit and also charted on the Radio & Records SMOOTH JAZZ CHART & the Billboard HOT AC CHART.<br />FAKE, the second single, followed SUNRISE to the top of the BILLBOARD DANCE charts and is a great sing along that will also have you dancing from start to finish.<br />But the masterpiece of this album is the remake of the STYLISITCS classic YOU MAKE ME FEEL BRAND NEW. At a time when it seems every veteran artist that puts out an album these days is recording covers, trying to get radio airplay, SIMPLY RED is actually able to pull it off. YOU MAKE ME FEEL BRAND NEW is one of the few songs by an indy artist in recent times that might be able to get airplay on top 100 radio. The song is already climbing both the Billboard Adult contemporary and DANCE CHARTS and should also do well at SMOOTH JAZZ stations, and with any luck, the hot 100.<br />If you buy this album, other than the songs mentioned above, you will also hear more smooth Jazz, AC/DANCE type songs such as MONEY IN MY POCKET or the easy flowing ballad, ITS YOU, both which would be good choices as singles in the future.<br />Overall HOME which was released in August of 2003 should remain popular all through 2004 and whether you are looking for a CD to listen to while you are working in the office or a CD to listen to while you are in the mood to dance, HOME fits the mold for all occasions.
B00005JMKI|1.0|The most disappointing aspect of this film, other than the direction + cutting, is Nicole Kidman's empty performance. She has come to the point in her career where she is offered far too many roles and can't pick the trash from treasure. If she doesn't slow down she may disappear. AVOID!!!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Who knew Bill Murray was such a terrific, nuanced actor capable of conveying feelings, thoughts, etc. without excessive dialogue and merely using finely understated body language, facial expressions, gestures and any other &quot;tool&quot; he can get his hands on? Ditto for Scarlett Johansson; she's pretty terrific as well. The photography is beautiful and the movie just glides along to an ending that you get to finish in your own mind - however you feel real people might respond; or, how you might want it to end up.<br />It takes courage in this &quot;bash-'em-between-the-eyes&quot; world to make a film that neither &quot;makes&quot; you think, nor lays everything right out in front of you - it's best to just watch and feel. Whether you &quot;get it&quot; or not (whatever that means) is irrelevant. Life itself is a random sequence of joys and sadnesses; as you get a little older, you figure out that it's really a journey without a destination. In this film, we are voyeurs getting to watch two very interesting, likeable and all too human people bump up against one another for a slice of time.<br />I haven't decided what my end will be yet. There are a lot of options. I do know, however, that this is a exceptional movie that, in a very stylish way, holds a mirror up in front of us. Highly recomended as a break from fantasyland with a couple of characters you'll like and root for.
B000001FY9|5.0|I honestly can't say that I am a fan of reggae music. For me, the music sounds the same no matter who is singing. However I will make an exception with Bob Marley, namely his greatest hits cd &quot;Legend&quot;. I consider myself more as a casual fan of Bob Marley's music so I felt that it was appropriate that I would be better off with &quot;Legend&quot;. &quot;Legend&quot; is  a good representation of Bob's stellar career. My all time favorite Bob Marley song is the politically charged &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot;. I have always loved that song since I first heard it on a mix tape from my brother. Another personal favorite is &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot;. The Fugees did a nice cover of the song but nothing beats Bob Marley's version. &quot;Redemption Song&quot; is another great Bob Marley song. It is such a great uplifting song. I love all the songs on the cd. It is a great cd to listen to at a party, and I know I have heard it many times at lots of house parties in my college days.
0345440900|1.0|I received this book as a gift and I eagerly read it, out of desperation.  We had a three-and-a-half-month old baby who was clearly exhausted and was fussing and crying all day and night (waking up every other hour).  This book's advice did not work at all, and actually upset our baby more, so he was even more worked up than he would have been if we had simply left him alone to cry it out.  What Tracy Hogg claimed to be a more humane method was actually much much worse.<br />For example, Hogg advocates for night crying to pick the baby up, comfort him until he stops crying, then put him back down.  If he cries again, repeat.  Up to hundreds of times per night.  This just kept our baby awake and made him more fussy, not just at night, but also the next day.<br />We were helped much more by &quot;Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child,&quot; by Dr. Marc Weissbluth.  Among other things, it points out that for &quot;easy&quot; babies, basically any parenting technique will work.  Hence, it's easy for people like Hogg to believe they have a gift, or special technique, etc.  It's the colicky kids that are tough.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Well, Its like this. Not to long ago an old chump of mine decided to lay on me these televised versions of a previously unheard of cluster of books.  With serious hindsight I should have just dismissed the dratted things, but you should know that the future happened to elude me just then, and I launched myself into them with all the gusto of an alley cat onto a fishbone. In fact the whole bally idea of it rather struck me.<br />  To be perfectly honest, I must say that it was hard to say no to after the pitch I was given. My sword swingin comrade said in no uncertain terms, and with a polite slowness that keeps me on the right level, that I would like them, that they were good, and that he would stand behind me with said sword and make sure I laughed. At first I gathered that he was laying it on a bit thick, but when I saw the fevered intensity that  broke out into a sweat across his face, I knew that he was sure of himself.<br />  They were dashed nonsense really, but I couldn't help but take a liking to them. Seeing an English gent trying to fix situational problems when he seems to be missing a bit of grey matter is all well and good, but I felt nothing but relief each time his valet was brought onto the scene to take matters into his own hands.<br />  Wooster (the grey matter missing chap), is a likable fellow. Always willing to help out a friend in need, which usually lands him into a tight spot, while Jeeves (the aforementioned valet), has a mind that can tackle the toughest issues, and is willing to do so as long as Wooster can stay within Jeeves's fashion limits.<br />  Along the way I encountered an odd, but strangely refreshing cast. From jolly old fish-face, to the newt toting Finknottle. From a multitude of Brittish gals who have the wrong idea that Wooster is madly in love with them, to an array of aunts who can't wait to find something wrong with the poor chap. (...) And I can't forget to mention the mob of friends who flit from one romance to the next.<br />  After sitting through all four seasons in a short 3 or 4 week time, I realized that Wooster was a part of me and I couldn't very well give up the poor fellow.<br />  I have of late found myself reading a dashed good novel called \\"Life With Jeeves\\", also provided by my previous mentioned chum. Supposedly it was written by P.G. Woodhouse, but I know it was really Wooster himself just using a pen name, after getting the idea from his friend Bingo who once gave him the false name of Rosie M. Banks, a popular novelist of her time. I know this because he wrote it in first person, and someone calls him by his real name at least once every page.<br /><br />  I am so infatuated that I have taken to prowling on Amazon, watching all the Jeeves and Wooster pages (and there are a lot of them), waiting for any fresh reviews to satisfy my new needs.<br /><br />  Just remember, your review had better be a bally good one..<br />  After sitting through all four seasons in a short 3 or 4 week time, I realized that Wooster was a part of me and I couldn't very well give up the poor fellow.<br />  I have of late found myself reading a dashed good novel called \\"Life With Jeeves\\", also provided by my previous mentioned chum.

B000002GB2|3.0|Probobly the best Styx album nobody's ever heard. Inventive songs with excellent musicianship. If you like Styx, you really should investigate this one. I consider it a gem. Usually fairly priced, too!
B0000DZEE3|5.0|If you don't have your DVD player hooked up to a kick-ass home theater setup, go out and buy one NOW so you can enjoy this DVD to its fullest!  The energy of this concert really comes through in this DVD and anyone who has ever liked any Red Hot song ever should get this now!  I've been disappointed with the production quality of some concert DVDs I've purchased recently, but this DVD's production values are top-notch in every way.  It has excellent clean audio recordings, and crisp, clear anamorphic widescreen video.
6305313687|5.0|Released in 1998 by New Line Cinema, American History X is a serious drama that reveals racism and hate prevalent throughout the world today.  Set in Southern California, where a real life white supremacy \\"Skinhead\\" movement has flourished off and on for more than a decade, American History X portrays the story of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton).  Vinyard, second in command of the local hate group, serves three years in the penitentiary for the brutal killing of two black men.  However, in prison he finds the truth concerning his racist cohorts and is befriended by a black inmate.  Upon his release from prison, Vinyard finds himself a changed man that must save his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from the movement he helped establish.<br />Norton's intense portrayal of both sides of the elder Vinyard, first as the angry, hate filled racist, and then as the loving, older brother determined to save his younger sibling from following the same path, earned him an Academy Award nomination.  This five star drama is emotional and powerful, and is filled with a recognizable cast including Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Elliott Gould and Stacy Keach.  Not for the weak and weary, American History X delivers the brutality associated with all racist groups, white and black, through to its climactic ending.
0451191153|1.0|I can understand why young people would like Ayn Rand: she tells us to love ourselves, tells us we are capable of great things, tells us to persist. And these teachings are, especially for high-schoolers, good things to embrace. But the other stuff she espouses, i.e., selfishness, social darwinism, compassionlessness-- these things are profoundly destructive. Sadly, Ayn Rand never realized there was a way to love yourself, help yourself, do great things, and still love and help others out, too. For some reason she thought the two were mutually exclusive. <br />Moreover, from a literary point of view Ayn Rand is an aggressively bad novelist. Her characters are one-dimensional;  her prose is bizarrely bland and plodding (and that's not even mentioning the forehead-clutchingly-bad dialogue); and her plots are as predictable as third-rate soap-operas. If you want to read great long novels try Dickens, Tolstoy, Faulkner, Woolf, or Melville. These cats make Ayn Rand look as sophisticated as a hyperactive first-grader with her first Etch-A-Sketch. <br />Rand's vision of existence ultimately was a very cowardly one: she only saw what she wanted to see. Instead of opening herself up to life and all of its beautiful complexity, she vainly sought to reduce it to neat, tidy, hateful philosophy. And plus philosophy-- as any philosopher whose worth his salt will attest-- can only solve so much.
B0001A79JO|5.0|This CD has some great songs on it.  They take the psychobilly sound and add a refreshing change of pace to it by some different musical influences to it.  Patricia's voice is amazing.
B00005JMSE|5.0|Wow,this movie kicks serious butt! I thought this movie would feel a little weak being pg-13,but It has the feel of an epic horror film with a comic book style.The story is great,the cast is awsome,Guillermo del toro should be given an award or something for getting ron perlman for the lead. The characters are all solid and there are no cute or any crappy wink wink moments directed at the audience.This film had cool superhero fights from start to end.Ive never read the comic but I think Ill start,I cant wait for part 2.
B0000AQS6U|5.0|Just received The Very Best Of Cher (Special edition)set of 2 CD's.  Even tho a lot of the songs are the same, I still enjoy both very much.  The one Performed \\"Live\\" is a change, because I can visualize Cher doing her special on TV, which was great.<BR>She is ageless! And I never get tired of her music.<BR>I would recommend this set for anyone who is a real fan of Cher.
B000008LOU|4.0|Sarcastically titled &quot;Vol. 3&quot;, the second (and last) album of the super-group consisting of George Harrison, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynn and Bob Dylan is more-of-the-same as &quot;Vol. 1&quot;, and I mean that as a compliment.<br />&quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3&quot; (11 tracks, 36 min.) starts off with an outstanding &quot;She's My Baby&quot;. Accoustic guitars are upfront throughout the album, not a surprise here. The songs move along at a crisp pace (all songs clock in between 3' and 3'30). Other highlights include &quot;The Devil's Been Busy&quot;, &quot;Poor House&quot; and of course the silly but irresitable &quot;Wilbury Twist&quot;.<br />Many feel that &quot;Vol. 1&quot; is a superior album because of Roy Orbinson's presence (he died shortly after &quot;Vol. 1&quot; was released). Nothing against Orbinson, but I feel differently. &quot;Vol. 3&quot; comes across as a much tighter album, with hardly a minute or a second wasted. Why both &quot;Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Vol. 3&quot; remain out of print is a mystery to me. The Traveling Wilburys remain a treasure to be (re)discovered.
B00003CXXP|5.0|The world would certainly be worse off without this strange, special-effect laden, Spielberg-Kubrick fusion--but why did Spielberg have to go (apparently) half insane with the plot?<BR>The film is puzzling enough in the first half, without the ridiculous ending. The relationship between humans and robots raises several questions: how can the robos, obviously made of metal inside, be given such an expressive skin? How can they react to changing situations so easily? Why do humans despise them so much to send them hurtling out of cannons at 'flesh fairs' which seek to celebrate human individuality? Why weren't the robots made easier to shut down and idenify if broken? All these questions are dwarfed by the sheer absurdity of the 2000-year leap through time at the ending, however.<BR>(Furthermore, why is Monica only able to come alive for one day--surely a day is an entirely arbitrary unit of time which derives from the earth's rotation rather than the 'unique spacetime pathways'?)<br />Howeve, despite these enormous plot-holes the film is both intriguing and moving. Personally I was driven to hatred of David's adoptive family's callousness, especially the very upsetting Martin. Indeed there did not seem to be a single really appealing human in the film--which cleverly enabled us to feel such sympathy for David and his fellow robots. The teddy, for example, is a delight, as are many of the other mechas, such as Jude Law's Joe. All of this conflict of emotions and challenging of beliefs could have been rounded off very well by ending the film with David's near-endless underwater wishing for the blue fairy to make him real. Instead Spilberg leaps 2000 years into the future (perhaps imitating Kubrick's famous cut from monkeys to the space station in 2001?) and the film heads straght down-hill.<BR>So should you watch it? Definitely yes, but be prepared for logical plotting to go right out of the window, especially towards the end.
B0001ZX0OM|5.0|I was truly amazed with this film when I saw it in theatres and have been anxiously awaiting its arrival on video for months now. Sean Penn gave a remarkable performance, as impressive as his usually are. I recommend 21 Grams to anyone else who enjoys his acting. Tim Robbins also did exceptionally well and Kevin Bacon gave an equally gripping performance.<br />I give the movie a full five stars.
B000006NPY|5.0|With Billy Corgan's mother's death comes this album. Very soft, very sad. There is an abundance of piano and this is their most heavily techno influenced album. Standout tracks include, &quot;Ava Adore&quot;, &quot;Perfect&quot;, &quot;Annie-Dog&quot;, &amp; &quot;For Martha&quot;.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|By far the best broadway show I've seen in years, and the soundtrack goes along perectly with this. I haven't taken it out of my CD player in over a month. If you can't go see the show BUY THE CD! If you can see the show - go see it! And buy the CD! I predict this show will be winning some serious Tony Awards!
B00005QJDG|5.0|To start, I think this CD rules. Dream Theater rules as a group, and each member rules by themselves. I know I'm not the only one who believes that that includes James LaBrie. His voice is absolutely amazing, and while he may sing off pitch a couple times on this CD, it's nothing that I can't put up with. His overall performance makes up for any missed notes. A lot of people seem to think he sounds absolutely horrible live. I think he sounds incredible! It all comes down to opinion I guess. Whether you like JLB or not, this live album is definitely worth the money.
B00005JMKI|4.0|Von Trier has never been to America and has been known to have said that he is afraid to visit the U.S. With this in mind, it seems a little audacious if not viciously self-indulgent to make a film about the ugliness of human nature set in an American village.<br />Critics have pounced on this feature of the movie, accusing von Trier of anti-Americanism. I feel such paranoid jibes completely miss the point: although Dogville is set in a fictional village in the Rockies during the Depression-era, it really could be any place, any time. It is anti-human-ugliness. The tagline reads \\"A quiet little town not far from here\\", and the sparse stage set reinforces that point. The viewer's imagination is meant to fill in the gaps, making Dogville their home town for nearly three hours.<br />The theme veers around Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives, seeking shelter from pursuing gangsters, the natives are reluctant to help. With the assistance of a local 'philosopher' (played by Paul Bettany), she eventually persuades the inhabitants to relent, and they grant her a two week trial period. During the fortnight, she manages to win the villagers over by performing good deeds, but gradually they begin to take advantage of her kindness and the rot sets in.<br />This is an extremely long film, but it is definitely worth the effort. It is an allegory of staggering proportions, it deals with virtually every aspect of humanity and some of the most fundamental questions people can face, whilst maintaining a lightness of touch that makes the mental workout more than bearable. Did it have to be 3 hours? No. But nor did the Matrix or LOTR or the Titanic.<br />So empty the tank, order a pizza and coke, and settle down for 180 minutes of cinematic genius.
B000002MH5|4.0|It's hard to say which album is the best of theirs, but I'd go with this or &quot;Green Mind&quot;. Neither are as rough as the early albums, or as smooth as the late ones, but just solid rockin' &quot;DJ&quot;. The popular songs were &quot;Out There&quot; and &quot;Start choppin'&quot;, but I also like &quot;Get Me&quot; and the excellent &quot;Goin' Home&quot;. That's probably one of my favorite &quot;DJ&quot; songs ever. As with every album, they're not all winners, but front to back this is one of the best. Newcomers might just want the &quot;Ear Bleeding Country&quot; collection. It's sweet too.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I love Tool.<br />I love APC.<br />The two should be different, but with this cd, they seem to blend.  Lateralus, in my opinion, was one of the worst Tool albums to date.  I love Opiate, I love Aenima, but Lateralus doesn't grip me at all the way the others do.<br />As is the same with APC.  Mer de Noms was awesome.  Just about every song was awesome (I wasn't a big fan of Rose, though... *shrug*).<br />This album is rather unlistenable for me.  Why, you ask?<br />It's the repetitive &quot;Tool-esque&quot; setup and fillers but with a different name.  It's obvious Maynard tried to grab the reins on this one.  I love Tool... I love APC... but this cd, as well as Lateralus, create this kind of wishy-washy existence... A Perfect Tool?  A Tool Circle?  Who knows.  <br />Simply put, this cd is great if you love both Tool and APC because of Maynard, and not because of how they're supposed to be different.  I personally had a hard time distinguishing the two after listening to this CD, in comparison with Lateralus.  Not a big fan, except for such songs as &quot;The Outsider&quot; and &quot;The Noose.&quot;  Those are the redeeming factors for this otherwise identity-crisis CD.
B000002UA0|1.0|This CD is terrible.  I have a number of other Pink Floyd CDs and this one doesn't even sound like Pink Floyd.  The songs are rambling and make no sense and most of them just sound terrible.  Don't get fooled into the myth about Barrett being some supergenius because he did so much acid.  This CD sounds BAD.
B00005B36H|4.0|This cd is nothing compared to Aenima and Opiate.  Even Undertow blows the doors off this cd.  The sheer un-listenability (is that a word?) of this album makes me put it in my cd player just to hear &quot;Parabol/a.&quot;  Otherwise, it just takes a slot in my overflowing cd book.  <br />In fact, all the songs have the same sound, feature the same notes and chords, and the same drum-beat.  Any drum solos are drowned-out in every song thanks to the over-used sound effects and blaring of the same tiresome chords and notes repeated over and over and over and over.  Schism is a prime example of this.<br />The only thing saving this cd from a 3 or less is the genius that is Maynard and his hypnotizing sound and lyrics.  Definitely not worth the money I spent.  I love Tool, but I hope this isn't a sign of things to come.
B00006HBUB|3.0|I have been a fan of Scooby since I was a baby. This film was entertaining but it was NOT funny.  It was GOOFY and corny. There's a big difference. Still, it has its moments. I could get over the cheap-looking computerized Scooby, the stale actress who played Velma, the squeaky Sarah Geller and boring Freddie Prinze Jr. if this film hadn't stopped to focus on a scene full of flatulence. Now enough is enough! I am so sick and tired of films counting on flatulence and disgust to be funny. I know this film was not for the usual conservative viewers but filmmakers should keep women in mind when they make comedies. Women do not find flatulence the least bit funny. It has no place in this film and ruined the act of just being fun. It's an okay movie but stupid scenes ruined its chances of being even better.
0385336810|5.0|I loved this book; I could not put it down and finished it in less than a day. Admittedly it was a bit predictable, but Kinsella's wit and character sense more than make up for the classic plot line.
B00006879E|4.0|Maroon 5 has a very origional sound. If I had to compare them to someone it would be Daniel Beddingfield. Most people would buy this CD to hear the two hit songs...&quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot; but the best track on the album hands down is...&quot;She will be loved&quot; It's very catchy and I think it will be their next hit..This CD is worth the $15...
B00000IMYA|5.0|After hearing a cut of this collection on the radio I immediately ordered and and found Ellington at Newport to be one of the greatest muscial collections I have ever heard. \\"Diminuendo in Blue\\" by itself is more than worth the price. For months this piece raised my spirits me as I crawled home on the L.A. freeways. I rank it is one of the most (if not the most) uplifting and stimulating recordings I have ever heard. The remainder of the collection is wonderful too and also deserving of five stars. There is so much on CD # 1 that it took me a year to start playing the second. The top ten lists Ellington at Newport can populate are endless. One of ten to take on desert island is only a start...
B00003CXC7|5.0|This extremely dense and subtle film is assuredly one of Hitchcock's greatest achievements. Too intrepid for his own good, Jefferies pays dearly for his mistake: confined to a wheelchair in a small apartment, he becomes a prisoner and takes pleasure in the multiple visions that unfold in front of him. He soon lives only through these images, a slave of adventures he wants to understand even as they elude his grasp; he periodically contemplates another kind of spectacle, that of Lisa courting him with the same energy he himself manifests as an amateur detective. He gradually identifies with his neighbours, and Hitchcock frequently equals his viewers with Jefferies, letting us see exactly what he sees. The film has a lot to say on the interpretative reading of works of art, as Jefferies tends to accept events only so far as they confirm his own hypotheses. It is when he seemingly elucidates the Thorwald mystery that he goes too far and commits his hubristic mistake for a second time; the film thus ends as it started, with Jefferies stuck in his wheelchair and Lisa reading a fashion magazine. Both goth too involved in the images...
0671027344|5.0|omg that book was the best! I just finished reading it like, 5 minutes ago. I was just amazed by it:D
B00005JMSE|5.0|I haven't read the comiv book so I can't comment on how closely it follows the storyline but the movie was great fun and the characters were likeable and well-played.  The story follows Chtullu mythology somewhat and I got to watch the old boy almmost take over the world one more time.  Give him points for persistance.<br />Ron Perleman stole every scene he was in, no just because he was the biggest red deman there but by sheer stage presence.  THere were a couple of hokey scenes and one continuity glitch toward the end but nothing I couldn't live with.  Go see it - well worth it.
B00006DEFA|4.0|This is a joy...<br />Despite it's flaws it still succeeds and should belong in any modest DVD collection. It's acted well and tries hard to invite the viewer into each real scene. The music (obviously) is beautiful and given it's proper strength, taking over many scenes (as it should) <br />The flaws are simply matters of taste on my part.<br />I think it's shot too bright, everything is so incredibly well lit! the whole world of Vienna appears to be an operating room awash in brightness. Only occasionally is any effort made by the director to \\"set a mood\\" that brings the lighting down. <br />Ultimately the film can be enjoyed despite this very well lit version of Vienna.<br />Secondly and not so importantly: <BR>As young Mozart walks along outside in the bustling streets of down town Vienna skipping through the market place. We are clearly on a movie set. Almost no effort is made to hide that fact. The streets are as though polished and shiny like the floor of a shopping mall. Not a single spec of dirt exists in the cobble stone streets of Vienna.<br />If you've ever been to Europe instantly this scene becomes almost bothersome thankfully it's very short.<br />Other than those two issues for me the film is very well done and I really enjoy the DVD for it's music and great characters portrayed in a really fun completely ambitious movie.
0553573403|1.0|This is the first of a very compelling adult fantasy series; however I can only praise the writing and not the story.  The book is very well-written; otherwise I would not have finished it or the other two Martin has written in the series.  The writing is so compelling that I will read the fourth book as well, but I cannot say I will enjoy the story.  Martin has filled this series with too much gritty realism and death.<br />The books are well-crafted, the main plot compelling, his characters quite realistic.  But the overall tone of the books is very dark and the series fails as a fantasy in my eyes because of it.  I prefer my fantasy to reflect the essential goodness of man, not the cruelty.  Martin's characters are realistic, true, and I do like my fantasy to feel real.  I even like my villains cruel.  But very few of his characters could be considered heroes or even noble and most characters suffer and die lonely and cruelly.  If only half his characters were cruel and selfish, I could have forgiven him the grim tone of this series, but nearly all of his characters are cruel, selfish, honorless, power hungry or mad (or both) and those few that do seem at least partially noble or honorable usually die.  I see enough cruelty and death in the real world and read fantasy for hope.  Instead Martin leaves me depressed and disappointed in this series.  I wish the few \\"good\\" characters that are left at the end of the third book would survive to save their world at the end, but I hold little hope for most of them.<br />In conclusion, I would recommend reading the series for its great craftsmanship and for the underlying main plot (that of winter coming), but be forewarned that these books are very dark and depressing, and you will see characters you like suffer greatly and then die.  And I must stress that I do not recommend this series for anyone under the age of 20, (by 20,  most have seen the type of gritty reality that Martin paints in the real world, but why disillusion someone younger?).sion someone younger?).
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Eric Clapton's fascination with the blues is legendary and way past wearing thin.  He may be a world's most informed blues scholar, but that's never translated into any semblance of actually being able to play the blues.  While Clapton can play a Robert Johnson tune note for note, he will never be able to invest anything personal into this music.  It's a little cliche, but he's got no soul.  And isn't that the one ingredient essential to blues and soul music?<br /><br />I've never really understood Clapton's gigantic reputation. His guitar playing is mechanical, lacking any swagger or excitement. His singing is serviceable at best. In time, history is likely to revise Clapton's importance, with records like this offering ample proof of a hollow effigy.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Many music listeners today don't realize that back in Robert Johnson's day (1930's), a musician played a lot of parties as his primary gigs, and whatever the partygoers wanted to hear, he was expected to know how to play (that is, if he wanted to be paid well and keep working!) A tune such as &quot;They're Red Hot&quot;, a blistering swing/ragtime/cakewalk number more reminiscent of Louis Armstrongs Hot Fives &amp; Sevens rather than the repetoir of a legendary blues Delta slide player like Johnson, might be featured along side more typical Johnson fare like &quot;Come On In My Kitchen&quot; or &quot;Hellhound&quot;. Surprise, Surprise! &quot;Red Hot&quot; is far and away the best number on this mostly disappointing disc, as Eric and band quit sounding as reverential as church, and sprint thru the number with gusto. Billy Preston's tinkling piano and Jerry Portnoy's wonderful harp provide the musical highpoints. &quot;32-20 Blues,&quot; &quot;If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,&quot; and &quot;Me and The Devil Blues&quot; are just about the only other good interpretations offered here. Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life. What happened to the great live-in-the-studio feel of From The Cradle, another all-blues masterpiece recorded just ten years ago to much better effect? Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry. (He drops into this mode from time to time; he practically lived in this mode the entire decade of the seventies.) For example, compare Eric's lame take of &quot;When You've Got A Good Friend,&quot; with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition. And the remake of &quot;Hellhound on My Trail,&quot; Johnson's signature tune?? What a disappointment!! For this take, Eric should have sent the band home and played the entire song with acoustic and slide. Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!! In closing, what can I say? The album does have several good offerings, mostly on the uptempo numbers, but Eric should now go back to square one and get in touch with his inner Johnson. Please???

Having hip problems and subsequent difficulty running I was about to give it up when I learned new running techniques from Danny Dreyer's new book, and DVD.

B00004YA66|5.0|This is a movie that when you see it again for the 2cd time you forget everything and start to panic.  Frequency contains drama, thrill, and suspense.  When Jim Caviezel finds out he is talking to his dead father 30 years ago... well anyway this movie is a masterpiece and it is a must see.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|This movie is horrible. I can't believe I actually sat through this whole movie without picking up my television and throwing it to the ground. There are so many holes and continuity problems in this script.. not to mention the fact that from a linguistic standpoint, the script changes the definitions of so many words, sometimes mid-movie - to serve its own pointlessness. If you are a 16 year old bi polar, you may like this film... if you are a 23 year old college grad, pass this one up. This script is what would happen if Jessica Simpson took a philosophy class and wrote a script on what she thought the class meant.
B00005JLF5|4.0|I can't help but compare this to the Next Generation box set. They set the bar pretty high with the Next Generation box sets, and unfortunately Deep Space Nine doesn't quite hold up.<br /> The box layout of DS9 isn't bad, but it's made of plastic, and looks kind of cheap.  The insert slides out and when it opens up it shows the DVDs stacked neatly inside, each on their own page. I like this better than the huge fold out of the Next Generation box set. The insert doesn't fit as well into its sleeve as I'd like. One of the plastic over pages tends to get caught, and the colour is wearing off there.<BR> The disks themselves have a pretty uniform layout, after the introduction you see four episodes listed (with the exception of the first disk, where the pilot was 2 hours), and there's a rotating shot  DS9 in the background. However there is no screen to show clips, so if you're trying to find an episode you've seen before you're out of luck.  You have to select the episode and hope the still there will give you enough information.<br /> One thing that really bothered me about the episodes is the chapter layout. On the Next Generation disks the first chapter was the first few minutes of the episode, and the introduction. You could chapter ahead to the second chapter of each episode and skip the introduction. They didn't do that with the DS9 episodes, and so chaptering ahead can skip over part of the episode, sometimes as much as two or three minutes.<br /> Overall I can't be too disappointed with the box set. I'm not too fond of the colours they chose or the plastic sleeve, and I really dislike the messed up chapters. However, considering that all the episodes are contained in one box set that's both cheaper and smaller than buying the individual episodes on VHS tape, I can't complain too much.
B00018D44U|2.0|I loved Come Away with Me because of the jazz feel and Jones' voice. I still like the voice, but this album is waaaay more country...
B000063V8U|5.0|Like the previous five seasons, this one has the same physical look and layout, four episodes per disk, six disks full, and the last two episodes on the seventh, special features disk. I have to confess the purple of this box is probably my favorite colour, and it really looks nice stacked up with the other DVDs.<br /> They changed the clip format for this box set, choosing to go with one screen showing clips of the four episodes back to back. While this allows you to focus your attention on only one screen, it can also be annoying. Season six seems to be in heavy rotation on television, and if you've seen a lot of the episodes the wait can be annoying, but it's worth it.
B0001IN07Q|3.0|Having just purchased this CD/DVD package I was really looking forward to seeing Michael on DVD - especially &quot;live&quot;. I am a great admirer and consider that his excellent relaxed voice portends a lot of future enjoyment especially for those of us still missing 'old blue eyes'.The CD although containing duplications was as enjoyable as usual, it was the longer timed DVD which disappointed me. Halfway through the viewing of it I frankly had seen enough. Expecting to view longer camera shots, particularly close ups of Michael, I found the jumping around twixt color and black and white, among other annoyances both distracting and often times bizarre! The documentary excerpts were very well done and interesting but why could'nt they have been shown prior to the concert performances??This package will hold its place in my collection but regrettably will not be played as often as my former Buble CD's.
B000063V8T|5.0|One of the things I really like about this box set is how sturdy they are. They've survived two moves, one of several hundred miles, and with reasonable care and packing they come out just fine. It is nice to see that they not only look nice, but are sturdy as well.<br /> Like season four, this season also has the split scene for the clips, with two playing in each window. It cuts down on waiting to see the clip of all four episodes, but it is a little difficult to follow if you're not sure you've seen all four of the episodes.  The clips are played against part of the grid layout of the holodeck, which is a nice touch, but still a little tough to follow.
0783225849|5.0|What more can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror movie PSYCHO that hasn't been said already? By now everybody knows what this movie's all about, so why go into it? Because without PSYCHO, the horror movie genre would be a whole lot different if this wasn't made! Just think about the different kinds of horror movies that have come out in the forty-four years since PSYCHO scared the hell out of audiences: the giallo in Italy (Mario Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE, Dario Argento's BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE and DEEP RED just to name a few, Lucio Fulci's DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING, the list goes on), the slasher movie (John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and Sean S. Cunningham's FRIDAY THE 13TH among many others), and all kinds of murder-mystery films. PSYCHO did for horror movies what The Beatles' appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show four years later did for rock music!<br />I remember the first time I ever saw PSYCHO. I was 16 and just entering the 10th grade when I watched PSYCHO on my personal black-and-white TV on Channel 17. Man, that blew my mind out of the water! To this very day, that shower scene is ten times scarier than any gore scene in any horror movie (ironically, the shower scene wasn't that very graphic). Now I have it on DVD and I saw it a few days ago and it's still terrifying!<br />And to the Unbiased Movie Critic, an Unbiased Correction: The 1998 version IS a remake! The original PSYCHO came out in 1960, THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS BEFORE GUS VAN SANT EVEN APPROACHED THIS STORY! It's fine if you prefer the 1998 version, some people do, but please get your facts straight. Anyway, this DVD offers PSYCHO in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, along with a truckload of extras! So check into the Bates Motel and be careful in the shower! And remember, &quot;We all go a little mad sometimes.&quot;
B000060K4O|4.0|This has to be THE film of the 80s! And I only watched it for the first time a couple of days ago. People seem to disbelieve that I haven't seen this movie before, and thought maybe I'd seen it, but just didn't remember it. I definitely would have remembered seeing this! I did know some stuff about it, and I've seen the green ghost about, and I always thought the big white guy was the Michelin Man for some reason? Apart from the fact it was so funny and there are some great actors: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis and Ernie Hudson.<br />There are some terrific looking extras on this, will certainly keep me busy one day when I go to look through them all.<br />Obviously, the ghosts and whatever aren't up to the standards of today, but that makes it all the more better. You can tell there's guys dressed up in suits, but it makes you laugh all the more. Nothing is disguised here.<br />There are some absolutely brilliant quotes too! Some of my faves include:<br />Winston Zeddemore: Ray. When someone asks you if you're a god, you say yes.<br />Dr. Peter Venkman: No, we're exterminators. Someone saw a cockroach up on twelve.<br />Dr. Peter Venkman: Mother pus bucket.<br />Dr. Peter Venkman: Somebody blows their nose and you want to keep it?<br />Dr. Raymond Stantz: Where do these stairs go?<br />Dr. Peter Venkman: They go up.<br />Dana Barrett: That's the bedroom, but nothing ever happened in there.<br />Dr. Peter Venkman: What a crime.<br />Dana Barrett: Do you want this body?<br />Dr. Peter Venkman: Is this a trick question?<br />Dr. Raymond Stantz: He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?<br />Dr. Peter Venkman: [quickly] I think he can hear you, Ray.<br />If you read some of those quotes carefully, you'll probably figure out who my fave Ghostbuster was - Bill Murray was pure genius in this and he cracked me up!<br />Of course, everyone knows the Ghostbusters theme tune. Frankly I love it! I love that song! I've even seen it done in concert by Steps a couple of years ago, and they did a fantastic version of it!<br />This is a terrific film. I beg you, if you haven't seen it, go and see it. You will not regret it.<br />Who you gonna call?! :) GHOSTBUSTERS!!!f years ago, and they did a fantastic version of it! <br />This is a terrific film. I beg you, if you haven't seen it, go and see it. You will not regret it.<br />Who you gonna call?! :) GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
0385512104|3.0|This book, as others have noted, is a pitch-perfect narration from a high-functioning autistic teenager who has written it in order to help him solve the mystery of who murdered his neighbor's dog. It starts out charming and unintentionally (from Christopher, the narrator's, viewpoint) amusing. But I didn't think it sustained this tone. <br />A minor point, but one that put me off was the narrator's focus on bodily functions. There are too many non-autistic characters out there whose creators feel compelled to describe their bodily functions in grotesquely loving detail, as if readers aren't familiar with what happens in the bathroom. This just seemed a continuation of that trend, however plausible this fixation was for an austistic man. A silly thing to comment on here? Maybe.<br />The book's focus shifts from who killed the dog to what is happening to the narrator's parents. This is the problem right there. Autistics (at least here) aren't equipped to understand the complexities of human relationships that most of us take for granted. So even though Christopher's limitations to puzzling out his parents' problems rang true, they also limited the novel as a whole - because aren't the best novel characters suppose to achieve some sort of change or growth in their perceptions at the end? Or at least the realization that they can't change the way they want?
B000089RVX|5.0|OK, this is my review for Evanescence's mainstreem debut &quot;Fallen&quot;. Now, I said mainstreem debut, because, they have a rare EP called Origin, which features some of the songs on Fallen. OK, let me tell you that I was a little dissapointed that they put the very orignal version of My Immortal. The radio edit is so much better, the album one is more sad, and even scary! I dont know why it scares me a little, but, Amy sounds like shes too depressed while shes very young. Well, that doesnt mean the radio version isnt on here, folks!! Its actually the hidden last track. I was hoping for that, and, Im soo happy!!! Well, the original piano version has grown on me quite a bit.<br />1. Going Under 5/5 2nd Single<br />2.

B00005QATY|1.0|Yes, I realize it is just a movie, but I don't find amimal cruelty funny. That is the scary thing about dark humor though - it makes it acceptable to laugh at such things.  I should have known when I found out the people responsible for this mess had made Fargo (murder, ha ha).  I tried to give this movie a chance because the soundtrack was done by people I liked but it was too disturbing and totally unentertaining for me, sorry.
0440241413|5.0|&quot;Confessions of&quot; was excellent...it deserves 6 stars!  Rebecca gets herself into a money rut and runs.  She sounds so much like me, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her.  Things start looking up near the end...I also recommend &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan!&quot;
B000060P79|5.0|i love this cd.  i don't c why ppl hate the fact that the songs are aimed at teens.  if ur not a teen, then shut up.  There's a lot of energy in their music.  They sound like their really having fun singin the songs.  I love it.<br />1)  I'd do anything-  Pretty good song.  Catchy melody.  Not my favorite, but pretty close<BR>2)  The Worst Day Ever-  One of my favorite songs, but obviously aimed at the depressed teenage group.<BR>3)  You don't mean anything-  Not a very musical song.  Repetitive.  Probably my least favorite on the cd.<BR>4)  I'm just a kid-  Another one of my favorite, and again, aimed at the teenage group, as most all of the songs r.  Really catchy.<BR>5)  When I'm with you-  Not bad, but not my favorite.  Lot of guitar, not a lot of variation beyond the melody.<BR>6)  Meet you there-  Great song.  very deep and meaningful.  another fav.<BR>7)  Addicted-  if u haven't heard this one u must have been living in a cave the last year.  great song, but gets kinda old after u listen to it a thousand times.  cept so do most songs.<BR>8)  My alien-  very odd song.  hasn't no meaning, just a fun song to sing along with.  not bad by a long shot, but not my fav.<BR>9)  God must Hate me-  massively aimed toward the depressed teenagers, and being one, i love it.  lot of emotion.<BR>10)  I won't be there-  Catchy tune, but not a great song.  Another one of my least favs.<BR>11)  One day-  all about being a kid who can't wait til he can get away from his parents.  i really like this one.  Full of emotion.  <BR>12)  Perfect-  Prolly the deepest song on the cd.  all about tryin to live up to ur parents expectations.  The band really knows about this being as their parents prolly wanted them to do soemthing for meaningful than be in a band.  very moving.<br />Grow up-  Not to bad, but not real good.  not exactly a showcase of musical talent, kinda immature, but still catchy<BR>Christmas List-  Really dumb song.  immature and stupid, but again kinda catchy.  kinda funny too.
033390687X|5.0|The best part of this audio book is the delivery of narrator Barbara Rosenblatt.  She is so hilarious and really delineates the persona of each person with their very own sensibilty and character. I really enjoy a narrator who can portray both sexes well, letting the listener believe the characters are real.  The basic sense of the book is not seen in diary form(which is essential to all note/list makers of the neurotic world), but, the narration breathes a new dimension into their lives regardless of any hopes of wanting certain aspects left to the imagination.  It makes all the episodes come through with impact and teeny victory every time she blunders, what we all hope for when looking back at humiliating events! Highly recommend this for listeners.
B000002H3E|5.0|Dokken, yes they're a part of the much maligned &quot;hair metal&quot; genre. And YES, they look like they had spent a day in their sisters closets by the looks of this GODAWFUL album cover. But to put it simply, the music is KILLER. Why? Two reasons: George Lynch and Don Dokken. Don's Klaus Meinesque singing isn't pure sissy cheese like alot of his peers of the period, and George Lynch has the tone of Schenker mixed with the inventiveness of EVH and the melody of Randy Rhoads to create some of the best riffs and solos in the period.
B00005NB8K|5.0|What can I say about \\"The Doors\\" that hasn't been said already. First of all Val Kilmer was so good in this movie that when I hear a Door's song I picture him instead of Jim Morrison. I wished I was born in the 50's so I could have seen The Doors.  Oliver Stone dipicts Morrison as a poet trapped in a rock star's body. The epic rise and fall of the Doors is great but sad at the same time. They had so much more to offer us. Remember people the Doors were only around for 5 years. Until Morrison's untimely death. The rest of the Doors are protrayed as innocent bystanders. John Densmore was pissing me off with his constent whining and crying. Robby Krieger was a cool guy, and Ray Manzarek was supercool. All these guys look like people that could have gone to high school with. The film has a nostaglic feeling to it, almost as if is a dockumentary rather than a film. Every time I see \\"The Doors\\" it feels as if its the first time.
B000006OAM|5.0|Ophelia is a master piece and one of the best CDs of pop music till today. Ophelia is not everyone, because is profound and deserves to be understand and absorb into your soul. The poetess Natalie sings her poems with Goddess voice and envolves us with her sould and makes us one of children. Listen to Natalie you will understand that CDs likes the ones from Madonna,Britney and others should be trashed. Ladies like Natalie, Cyndi Lauper and Tracy Chapman give more seriousness to the commercial Yankee music. The Goddess have the Latin blood, because from her name and last name you can see she if of French origin. French is one of the Latin languages and one of the Latin cultures. The is why she is so profound and great poetess. Buy this CD and you will love it!!!!!!
1878424319|5.0|this books is truly great, i bought it not expecting much but it really turns your life for the better in many aspects teaching you simple yet useful lessons that we can all use in our life
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson are superb in this movie. While the plot is a bit old, their acting makes the movie worth watching. Great comedy!
B000089RVX|5.0|Fallen is my favorite CD. Theres not many CD's where I love every song on the entire album. Usually I only like a few songs and the rest I never listen to but this CD, I dont get that.<BR>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS!!  Evanescence's sound is so unique and unlike any other band.  You have your more rockish songs like &quot;Bring Me Back To Live&quot; and &quot;Going Under&quot; and other (softer? maybe is the word) songs like &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;.  So theres a big mix of different sounds in this CD.  They are great in concert too if they ever come to your city.....<br />PEMPIE
B000001YOW|5.0|Signify is an album about significance.  Hence the title.  People who are going to buy this album are probably already big into Porcupine Tree much like myself when I bought it.  If you are a fan you will not be dissapointed in the least.  It is a bit heavy on the instumental side but that's no a bad thing in this case.  It is a very atmospherical cd.  The flow is excellent and each song has something interesting about it.  The only exception to this I would say is Pagan.  It's a short trippy piece but there isn't to much that stands out.  It's more of a song connecter between The Sleep of No Dreaming and Waiting Phase One.  If you are even thinking of buying this album then you should.  This is however my opinion just like the other people who rated it as they did.  From Bornlivedie to Dark Matter the work on this cd is simply excellent.
B000002HRE|1.0|Why do people like metallica so much, they suck in general.  I wish they would just disappear. They suck almost as much as ozzy.
B00005NB8K|3.0|As a huge fan of The Doors, I was disappointed by some parts of this film. If you like the band or Jim's poetry and you're debating whether to watch this or not, I'd say go ahead and do it. However, I think you'd get a lot more out of reading a book about them instead. The most annoying part of the movie was how Stone kept putting in Doors song quotes in places where it just didn't work. For anyone who isn't familiar with their lyrics, it'd seem like a regular script, but it bothered me to no end when Jim jumps on the car and says, &quot;I am the lizard king..&quot; and the, &quot;Blood is the rose of mysterious union&quot; part. Val Kilmer is amazing as Jim, though. Fantastic. So the main reason I only gave it three stars was because of the hokey lyric add-ins and the fact that it wasn't a terribly accurate movie.
B000002UVZ|5.0|Largely underrated by even most fans, Pageant is quite simply the best album of REM's career(and that takes some doing!)Songwriting,invention and melody at its absolute peak. This is without doubt one of the best albums of all time from arguably the consistently best band of all time.Most fans will know the rockier side of REM from Monster,which although good by most people's standards,is sadly REM's worst album by their standards.If you want to hear a band really rock then you must buy this collection of masterly songs.Amazing from start to finish.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty really was a beautiful piece of classic film making. It made me think about my own life, my path, my place in the world, how stupid life really can be but its these moments which I should give such gratitude for. It also had a beautiful take on death - I never felt so secure after watching this film. Its demonstration of how complex we make life for ourselves and what we think will make us happy was so sternly powerful and moving, for its the more subtle things all around us everyday that we should be living for and give thanks to. We have forsaken our real happiness for the things that we think should make us complete and content as individuals. <br />Alan Ball's script was just too awesome - the way it majestically flowed was so elegant and inspiring. It contained numerous moments of comical excellence but entranced you with its unfolding drama. It managed to mix these things up into one hell of a story and with Thomas Newman's chilling, atmospheric yet sublimely beautiful score it all combined to leave you with a sense of breath-taking emotional awe. And of course the highs and lows of the film's finale - I should have felt sad but it gripped me so powerfully that all I could feel was this astounding happiness and optimism for life. No film has ever made me feel like this. <br />And I'm not alone here or dillusional in its merits and strengths as a film. We may be able to disregard its Best Film at The Oscars seeing The Academy is so unbalanced in its pickings of past Best Picture accolades (Forrest Gump over Shawshank, Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Ryan for example) but The BAFTA's, Australian Film Institute - Britain and Australia's most prestigious awards committee, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, the Chicago, Las Vegas, Kansas, Dallas Film Critics Association Awards, the London Critics Circle Film Awards, Online Film Critics Society Awards I could go on all gave it the Best Film title amongst other awards to its name.And it was widely accepted by the 'big' (and lesser) film critics Roger Ebert, Rod Dreher, Mike Clark etc as a top 4 star film. <br />Too damn right!
B0001AP12G|5.0|How long has it been since there was a real thought provoking,interesting rap album??  Let's say too long. Kanye West's College DropOut is the best rap album in years. In these days of Hip-Hops &quot;Bling is King&quot; b/s rap, West flexes his intellectual muscle on this album. Maybe the success of this album will make some changes in the rap community for example: NO ONE CARES WHAT KIND OF CAR/JEWELRY/GIRLS etc. you have....Creative beats, lyrics that make you step back and think about life and flawless flows....This guy is the new king of Hip-Hop simply put BUY THIS RECORD A.S.A.P. 4REEL! peace and love!

0671042858|5.0|I read this book about 4 years ago. I was spending two years in a state owned work farm for juveniles, as you can imagine I had alot of free time on my hands in those days so i read a whoooooolllleeee lot of books.  Almost ever stephen king book, almost every john grisham book, tom clancy, then the beat generation, Then the classics.....etc.  This is the only book by stephen king or any other author that has completely captivated me.<br />The way the book is written is just unbeliveable.  Following the girl through the woods and building so much suspense.  What is the creature?  Page by page you realize that there is something out there that is hunting her like a man.  The book hardly leaves the girl in the woods which is the real story.  It was like I was stranded out there with her every step of the way.  I'll admit I was let down by the ending, but it didn' spoil the whole experience.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I am a bit dissapointed with this newest outing from one of my favorite singers on the planet but even then, &quot;Afterglow&quot; is a really fine album that shows great depth and emotion.<br /> The main dissapointment in my opinion is that the music is a bit too mellow and tired compared to her previous outings and the album playing time is a joke being only 40 minutes long!<br /> Despite the short playing time, this is a really excellent work of art that shows Sarah's continuing maturity and that it shows that she shows no signs of slowing down and the trademark sound is still there if a bit more subdued than before. &quot;World On Fire&quot; is just beautiful and ranks among the greats. The same goes for &quot;Train Wreck&quot;.<br /> By all means go for this album but try to look at it one it's own merits and don't try to compare it to her previous albums and then you'll be a very happy camper with this outing!
B0001I55OC|1.0|Because I loved this book so much I was expecting very little from the movie. That's how it generally works with Michael Crichton, and I've learned my lesson after Congo, Sphere, and Lost World, all great books and poor movies. And even with making such low demands on the film, it still topped them all. This is possibly Crichton's best novel and definitely the worst adaptation, maybe the worst adaptation of any popular fiction book ever.<br />Timeline failed on every level in which a movie can fail. The acting was atrocious by just about everyone who had the misfortune to be involved, the adaptation is a shred of what the original story is, the dialogue sounded as though it were made up on the spot by the actors, the 14th century realism was on the level of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and the casting couldn't have been worse if you'd been trying. The whole movie had a low budget feel to it, producing a result I would've expected ten or fifteen years ago before audiences really cared. <br />The movie (not the novel) is about several archeologist/graduate students who travel back in time to rescue their professor who's been trapped in 14th century France. They only have six hours to do it or else they're forever stuck there. Nobody can go back and rescue them after their six hours have expired, despite the fact that that's exactly what they are doing to the professor. Once they have journeyed back in time things start to go predictably wrong in the past and in the present. Using their knowledge of history, the archeology kids manipulate the armies of England and France while trying to fix various anachronisms they've introduced and not create new ones in the process. There's love, war, even unintentional comedy. What more could you ask for in a film?<br />Answers below.<br />1. Acting - I'm going to just say it: Paul Walker (Chris) is the worst male actor I've ever seen in a major-budget movie. Hands down. Worse than Keanu, worse than Vin Diesel. The only thing that helps him in this movie is Frances O'Connor (Katie) who is, amazingly, even worse. What makes it so unbearable is that the storyline keeps Paul and Frances together for most of the movie, so we get to see these two gems with no one else on screen to hide behind. In the spirit of honesty, I have to say that I've seen better acting in porn. I hope for the sake of film that Paul Walker isn't the flavor of the month long enough to ruin more potentially good films, not that Timeline is really in that category.<br />2. Plot - The adaptation of Timeline drastically departed from Crichton's novel and in all the wrong directions. I realize that certain aspects must be changed from a book to make the movie work, but there's a certain point at which the story can become so severely mangled that any reason for the story existing in the first place is gone. That's what happened to Timeline. Why was Timeline a huge bestselling novel? Because it was the first technically plausible time-travel story that we'd ever read. It combined detailed fact with fiction in the seamless way only Crichton can do it. And it painted a realistic picture of how such technology might be exploited if they were developed. Without that, it's just another brainless sci-fi story. Now here's the point - *none of those things made it into the movie!* That's what made it great, and none of it's there. The result is a convoluted mess that is hard to follow even if you know the rough storyline.<br />3. Realism - Director Richard Donnor made it a point in an interview to state that he was going to favor actual sets instead of special effects. I'm all for this generally - if you're actually going to put some work and money into it. One problem that epics such as Braveheart and Lord of the Rings have created is that half-hearted offerings such as Timeline are pallid and limp next to them. Half a dozen English soldiers clumsily drawing their swords while dramatic music plays just isn't going to cut it. Norare \\"night arrows,\\" which, though I'm not a history expert, I'm pretty certain never existed as a legitimate military threat, certainly not on the cunning level of warfare mastery with which they are depicted in Timeline. And the \\"If we don't leave it here then we'll never find it in the future!\\" moments give me another reason to cite Bill and Ted as a comparison.<br />If Michael Crichton wants a good movie made out of one of his books, apparently he's going to have to write the screenplay himself as he did with Jurassic Park. I understand that he pioneered a new kind of contract with Timeline, accepting a percentage of the Box Office in lieu of a set dollar amount. I have to wonder how he felt about that decision after seeing the first cut of this epic disaster.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The Matrix Revolutions is the perfect ending to the best sci/fi series in the last 10 years at least. I loved this movie! I just don't understand why everyone (on the net anyway, everyone i know loved it) is so quick to trash this film. The entire series is enthralling and unlike anything we've ever seen. I guess it's a bandwagon thing. I also loved Reloaded, which got the worst reviews of all of them. I saw Reloaded on a bootleg VCD in Baghdad with about 15 buddies and the \\"DAMN\\"s could be heard all over the camp. Isn't that what this kind of movie is supposed to do? It wasn't till i returned to the states that i found out it was supposed to suck. Anyway, along comes Revolutions and i see the same types of reviews and i dont understand. Devoid of emotion? Several lead charactors give thier lives for rest of humanity. Does it get any more emotional than that?  Incoherent? Listen to the dialogue. The Oracle herself explains that nothing is concrete. Her answers are possibilities, not rules. Why sould <BR>we have everything broken down for us us when our main charactors don't even know whats going on? We are with our charactors on this quest, not ahead of them.<BR>Boring? Thats just plain wrong. This film kept me tapping my feet and chanting \\"go,go,go\\" to myself from beggining to end. The APU/Sentinal battle is by far the most awe-inspring specticle ever put on film. A MORE EXCITING MOVIE YOU WILL NOT FIND. So everything doesn't wrap up in a nice little package at the end. Aren't we tired of nice little packages yet? The Wachowski's have changed movie-making forever and deserve credit for it. Don't let negative reviews steer you away from this film or any other in the series. A movie has to be taken for what it is, not how YOU would have made it. Maybe it would make everyone happy if new filmmakers stopped trying to do fresh ideas and just kept churning out the same recycled crap we've been seeing for years. I am so tired of seeing the same old tired tripe recieving such praise and making billions. We are telling new talent to just throw thier hands in the air and give up. The Wachowski's probably have a lot more to offer, but after the reaction to this, thier lifes work, which they were obviously very proud of- will they bother?  SEE this film and make your own decision. Like or dislike it for your own reasons and not because someone else is on a highhorse. Get off the bandwagon and take a movie for what it is : entertainment.

B00000DG1R|4.0|Listening to it right now...and this disc has all the DD staples...songs we all have come to love...great disc..great band...if you like DD...buy this disc!!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I've recently discovered this little-known UK band, Muse, and I'm blown away by almost every aspect of this release. The music is heavy alternative, but with a production and songwriting expertise that takes it all to a new area of exploration. The band's driving force is classically oriented progressions played by guitars, pianos, drums, and more guitars. All the while, Matt Bellamy bellows his amazing melodic impressions over the whole thing. <br />Straight away, something needs to be addressed. This band and its singer, despite the nitpicking disclaimers other reviewers have tried to make, sounds remarkably similar to old Radiohead (The Bends, OK Computer in particular). Matt Bellamy, in fact, could be a stand-in on any Radiohead tour. I actually did research to see of Bellamy was really Thom Yorke masquerading in a front band. That's how much they sound alike, bottom line. You can try to compare and contrast abstract and subtle approaches to style that differ, but the reality is if someone would've told me this was an unreleased Radiohead record from 1997, I would've believed them, no questions asked. <br />However, this isn't an entirely fair comparison. I also would've said of this fictional 1997 Radiohead release, &quot;Wow, Thom's singing range has really expanded...and the music's gotten far more complex...and the production is more intense and intelligent than other Radiohead records...&quot; <br />That all means that Absolution actually blows by any early Radiohead comparisons that others would make. So what if Matt Bellamy sounds just like Thom Yorke? He sounds *better* than Tom Yorke. So what if the chord progressions are similar to OK Computer's monolithic vamp sections? Absolution's are far more accessible and integrated into the songs, rather than treated as special musical bridges (as in OK Computer). Bottom line there? They do Radiohead better than Radiohead, especially now, while Thom and the boys are off experimenting with German euro-trash techno, the stuff that Aphex Twin has been doing better than them for years. <br />This is also an unfair comparison because Muse incorporates a far greater span of influence into their music than Radiohead (or any modern band trying to do this). I hear tons of Queen in their music, as well as hints of ELO, especially in the vocal arrangements. It's also evident that Bellamy has spent some time with the classical composers - Rachmaninoff, Puccini, Chopin for example. Their melodies permeate his writing - and I love every minute of it.<br />The songs are all astounding. The melodies are haunting, the production fresh and very unique. My only complaint is that the sonics aren't particularly good. There are times where the mix is so huge and distorted that it's hard to even pick out what they are trying to do. At the same time, music like this sort of needs that to sound &quot;right.&quot; These same songs recorded in pristine settings would probably sound far more stale than the raw genius portrayed on Absolution.<br />Also recommended if you like this: Jump Little Children &quot;Vertigo&quot; and Sigur Ros &quot;()&quot;
0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel is an excellent writer who writes Pi Patel so well that I feel as though I know him personally. The troubled times Pi goes through during his fight for survival is touching. I was rooting for him all the way until the end. Although I was a little upset by the ending, it just made me think of how Yann Martel is using his story as an allegory to our world today. There is a side that most people choose to see that although it is not a fairytale world it is nice and the end turns out to be ok. But there is the uglier, more true side that some people refuse to see. Although in Pi's first story it is not perfect or easy by any means, it is better and easier to deal with than what happens in the second side of the story.
0385504209|2.0|The curator of the Louvre museum in Paris has been murdered, leaving behind a string of clues--not to his murderer's identity, but to a secret for which he and others like him have been responsible for keeping.  Faced with the idea that the secret might die with him, he spends his last minutes setting up a treasure hunt for two people:  his granddaughter, a cryptologist with the French version of the FBI, and Robert Langdon, a professor of symbology.  Together they embark on what turns out to be a quest for the Holy Grail, but a Holy Grail unlike anything the reader has ever heard of.  Or so the author seems to hope.<br />This novel relies very highly on the supposed sensational nature of the secret.  Much of the drama, especially in the early parts of the book, hinges on interrupted revelations.  Unfortunately if you already have read the source material, or have been exposed to Mr. Brown's subject before, the contrived nature of his plot becomes not only apparent but tedious.  As a digest of various...alternative religious beliefs, secret societies, philosophies and conspiracy theories, this volume is not without interest.  However, the writing is pedantic, sometimes sounding as if it had been excerpted verbatim from various encyclopaediae.  In other areas the plodding conversations, stereotyped characters and trite similes also make the reading a trial.<br />I have to admit my reading habits are eclectic, but I had a hard time believing in the blindness of the main characters when it came to the puzzles;  more often than not I solved them full chapters before Mr. Langdon and company.  I also didn't find the ending any great surprise.<br />In spite of its faults, _The DaVinci Code_ does manage to be a page turner and as such is a relatively quick read.  My disapointment stems from the fact that I was hoping for some new treatment of the subject matter and didn't find any. I give the book credit for taking the subject into the realm of popular fiction and exposing it to a wider audience than it has heretofore enjoyed.  But I can't help but think that had the topic not been in itself so controversial, _The Da Vinci Code_ just wouldn't have gained such noteriety.  The quality just isn't there.it to a wider audience than it has heretofore enjoyed.

B0001HAHXW|4.0|Recording this album has been haunting EC for forty years.  It has been anticipated by EC fans for the same amount of time.  It is EC's hellhound of sorts.  As a longtime Johnson admirer and interpreter of many of his tunes throughout the years it made sense that one day he would actually produce this release.  By the reation of most of the reveiwers on this site it looks like most love it or hate it.<br />On one hand many may have been looking for over-the-top treatments full of fire and brimstone, ala Cream.  Many others may have been seeking authentic interpretations of Johnson's 29 song playbook.  Still others may have been looking for fresh inspriational interpretations.  Rock/blues treaments of Johnson's  works of art would not have been acceptable as they tend to morph into a self-induldgent, masterbatory mess.  A heavy, over interpretation would have been a disaster.  Attempting to duplicate Johnson's acoustic classics would have been embarrassing for EC as he has no where near the vocal ability of Johnson.<br />Some may feel this release insouciant and maybe it is, so what. So what is this English boy to do?  I believe a relase of any other tone would have garnered the same exact responses.  EC offers a reverent, honest, light-hearted tribute to his prime insiration and I think it is a fun listen.  I'll agree with the critiqe that the cover art is deceiving, almost rediculous.  However, to all of the one star voters, losen up, give it another spin, and just enjoy the updated sound of these great tunes.  I get it, thanks EC.

0385504209|1.0|There is very little to be said in favour of this novel: it is a rehash job with a bad plot added to it, it is badly written, it lacks research (and provides lots of false information) and contains no characterization. Why on earth was this a bestseller? And why are all the main characters so useless at getting the clues?<br />Anyone can point out the factual errors, but which young French Parisian woman would ever utter the following: &quot;You're kidding, right? We're going to visit a knight?&quot;<br />What a waste of money! I can only hope it kept a few ignorant Americans amused on their cruises - or that it encourages them to visit the Temple Church (based on the Church of the Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which I suppose is pagan inspired, too ...), etc., etc.
B00013RC9I|3.0|After an highly acclaimed debut, &quot;Moon Safari&quot;, an interesting sophomore release with &quot;10000Hz Legend&quot; and a contribution to Sofia Coppola`s &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; soundtrack, Air return with another worthwile effort. As usual, this french duo presents catchy (although complex) songs that are gripping and addictive enough to deserve repeated listens. Their meld of chill-out, lounge, trip-hop, jazz, electro and pop is unique and hypnotic, presenting some memorable moments like the opener and soothing &quot;Venus&quot;, the elliptic and impressive &quot;Run&quot; or the dreamy first single &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot;. Despite its many qualities, &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; isn`t quite deep or innovative enough to deserve &quot;instant classic&quot; status, still it works as an intriguing and pretty exercise in melodic experimentalism.  <br />Recommended.
0792165020|5.0|Southern Italy, the 50s.  Nerdy Tom Ripley is hired to bring the gorgeous playboy Dickie Greenleaf home to America.  Tom and Dickie live off Dickie's father's paycheck, and live a life Tom has never dreamed of.  Then Dickie says that this cant go on forever.  And Tom will do anything to keep it.<BR>The performances or the best part of this movie.  Matt Damon is effective as nerdy, pale, Tom Ripley.  He takes an Oscar-worthy turn halfway when he turns into a creepy killer.  Gwyneth Paltrow is also Oscar-worthy as Dickie's girlfriend, but she is best in the 2nd half when she becomes suspicious of Tom.  Cate Blanchett has a small role as an aquaintance of Tom's, and she is flawless as usual.  But the best of them all is two-time Academy Award nominee Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf.  His obsessions move so quickly, and Law is right on the money.  He pulls off being a jerk really well, and introduces depth around the character so well.  He doesn't just say the lines and follow the expressions from the director, he becomes the character and he never falters.<BR>The fun only increases in the second half, but i wont give it away!<BR>Grade:  A
0156907399|5.0|\\"Lighthouse\\" is a unique novel which established Virginia Woolf's reputation as a great writer. The story focuses on 2 days in the life of a large middle class family, with a middle interlude where the family's house is the major character. The setting is the family's summer home, filled with house guests. The action, however, is all internal, the chronology hazy and the events--to the extent anything really \\"happens\\" at all--rather mundane. <br />This all made for tough going until it \\"clicked\\" around p. 50. What Woolf does is create in real time not \\"real\\" events but what is going on within--that constant stream of thoughts and emotions that remains hidden from the world. Woolf spends a long time on a simple scene of Mrs. Ramsay reading a story to her 6 year old son. In the space of a few short minutes as she reads aloud Mrs. Ramsay considers whether an engagement she has been encouraging between two of her guests will occur, feels trapped between her son's desire to go to the lighthouse and her husband's cruel squelching of the idea, worries about the bill to repair the greenhouse, and underlying all senses impending doom just beyond the horizon. Another example is Woolf's description of the interior struggle of Lily as she paints in a style that happens not to be in fashion at the time. But Woolf shows us what Lily sees in her mind--a line here, a shadow there, a form.<br />Virginia Woolf has a reputation of being \\"hard to read\\" and I was unsuccessful in trying to persuade my book club to try \\"Lighthouse.\\" But I'm glad I plowed ahead on my own--it's a rich and complex work, and totally unlike anything I've ever read. Try it!
B0001ENYKS|2.0|Why do I fall for the British press' exclamations of the &quot;next big thing?&quot;  My simplistic review is that these guys sound almost exactly like the Strokes.  From the guitar sound to the way the vocals are recorded.  <BR>I was hoping for something new, different, or at least rocking.  The FF cd is none of these.
B00003CXFU|3.0|Although highly overrated, this movie is far from being great, as it is distant to Z-grade filmmaking. Overall, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; is an above average Hollywood flick that suceeds due to two relevant elements: the director Steven Soderbergh and the lead actress Julia Ruberts. Frankly, I have never been a big fan of any of them, but I`ll admit that they make this movie work. <br />Roberts gives a solid and convincing performance, probably her best ever, and proves that she can do better than formulaic romantic comedies. Soderbergh creates a film that is somewhat like many predictable TV-movies, yet he manages to present a couple of details which turn this effort into a peculiar and distinct one (professional and appealing direction, competent character development, a familar story told in an absorbing and gripping perspective). <br />Despite the typical Hollywood ending that certainly won`t surprise anyone, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; is an interesting cinematic experience that doesn`t need to rely on high action, multiple twists or shock-value scenes to offer enough dramatic tension. This is a subtle and well-crafted effort, not the great film ever but not a disappointment either (however, the huge hype that it received may work against it).<br />A compelling mainstream product.
B00007AJF9|5.0|Director Shekar Kapur takes us on a beautiful and exhilarating biography of Elizabeth the Virgin Queen.  Every last piece of this film is a work of artm from the editing to the acting.  The cast of actors is extravagent, but the film itself without a doubt belongs to Cate Blanchett in the Title role.  In virtually every scene, she makes us believe that she is Queen Elizabeth in flesh and blood, not herself potraying her.  She undeservedly lost her Oscar to Gwyneth Paltrow, but in my opinion that was because of fame, not talent.  To get further evidence of her talent, check out The Talented Mr. Ripley, and The Gift.  She can effortlessly transform her Aussie accent into anything she wants, without fault.  This film is not for the faint of heart, as it features some brutal and disturbing images, such as its opening sequence of burning three heretics at the stake.  My grade:  A+
6305313687|3.0|Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is the young leader of a neo-Nazi skinhead group who is sentenced to three years in prison for killing a car thief.  His impressionable younger brother (Edward Furlong), who looks up to him, is assigned by his principal (Avery Brooks) to write a report about the factors that shaped Derek.  Derek emerges from prison a changed man and attempts to set himself and his brother on the right path.<br />This film is a serious but flawed examination of racism.  It certainly has its heart in the right place, but it has a perfunctory feel about it.  Norton's performance is brilliant, but while he plays both the fiery racist and the weary survivor with consummate skill, the transitions between these states seem to be missing.  Derek's abandonment of racism seems to be based on the fact that it didn't protect him from abuse in prison, thereby providing a practical, utilitarian motive for his change rather than a moral one.  To compound this problem, while Derek's racist rhetoric is delivered forcefully with a passion that becomes convincing if one allows oneself to be seduced by his fervor, an equally impassioned view from the opposite side is never articulated.
B00012FXAE|1.0|I'll give this one 1 star-for the very good creature special efx only. But, that's the only thing that this sequal bettered than the original. One reviewer, at the time of the films release, noted that this is little more than &quot;Rambo in outer space&quot;, and they are right. This is an ACTION movie-not a Horror-Sci-Fi movie. True fans of horror: the atmosphere, the tension, mood ect , will not think this is a classic. It was at this period that action movies really came to the forefront and this indeed does belong in that slot.<br />Stick with the original. I also think the under-rated 3rd Alien is much better than this. Forget the ridiculous &quot;Resurection&quot;, I never even got past the silly part in that one where the born-again Ripley prooves she's a basketball star.<br />I will say this is better than &quot;Resurection&quot;-but that's about the only thing it's better than.
B00005JKTF|5.0|I really do not understand what all these negative reviews are about. This film is positively superb.

B0001HAHXW|1.0|What could have been an awesome CD is pretty lame.  As several reviewers have stated, the cover art and even the title of the disc, implies that this was a disc with just EC and his guitar playing Robert Johnson tunes.  This cd is overproduced and there are way too many instruments on it.  Stick to the Robert Johnson originals unless you like slick, overproduced, syrupy, blues imitation.  What happened to EC?
B00005RYP7|5.0|This was an excellent movie. A girl who's 16 and her 12 year-old brother was told one night that their parents were in a bad car accident and died. They were sent to the Glasses'home to live. The Glasses'were old friends of their parents. But Ruby (LeeLee Sobieski)thought the family was a little strange and freaky. She wasn't really enjoying her time there. The happenings in the movie I won't reveal. Watch this movie and find out. You won't be disappointed.
B000002H1T|2.0|This is not even close to the best album by The Cars, but it had all the pop radio hits like &quot;Drive&quot; &quot;You might think&quot;, and &quot;Magic&quot;. I don't like the soft rock pop of the Cars but prefer their earlier albums like the debut and Candy-O.  The Cars are one of the greatest New Wave bands of all time but they slipped in my opinion from 1984 and on.  Do yourself a favor and buy their first three albums to hear musical genius.
B0000CFW87|5.0|this album is magnificent.  i love the way josh groban sings.  his voice is very big and flowing and the sounds he produces just flow into your ears.  i really like the english songs on the album and they are about the only ones that i can understand.  about half of the cd is spoken in other language, one is in french, then i think the others are in italian and perhaps there is one in spanish.  i can only catch a few of the words in the foreign songs but the voice allows you to still enjoy the musci even though it is in another language.  the cd is great and his voice is the true achievement, i love it on the cd, but i can only imagine what it is like to here him live.

B00006879E|4.0|I liked their first song harder to breathe, but the song this love is what really got me to buy the cd.  i love the song because of the beat and the statement he is making in it.  most of this cd is inspired by the relationship he had with one of his ex-girlfriends.  the song really shows the kind of effort he put into the relationship and how much it really took out of him.  two othe stand out songs on the cd are track 4, she will be loved.  i love this ballad and again shows the level of love he had for this girl.  i think that it really pulls at the heart strings.  then there is the other ballad on the cd track 12, the sweetest goodbye.  this song is like closure for him and the relationship.  it shows that he loved her but now through his songs he is ready to get rid of her and say goodbye.  this really is a very good cd and the other songs are well written and performed.  this is a very mellow kind of cd and is my preference when i like to listen to rock music.  there is not any tracks with a really hard edge and this album is very personal and revealing and get his feelings across.  listen to it all the way through it is a nice ride.
B000002JSZ|5.0|I think Flick Of The Switch is the best Johnson era AC/DC album next to Back In Black.With great vocals,shouted choruses and irresisible riffs AC/DC have recorded another classic album and all the songs are great.Its not as good as Back In Black but it is better than For Those About To Rock which is still one of my favorite albums anyway.It starts off with Rising Power one of AC/DC's best anthems and ends with Brain Shake with not a layer of fat in between.All of the songs have killer grooves but my personal favorites are Rising Power,House Is On Fire,Badlands,Nervous Shakedown and Guns For Hire.I dont understand why it wasnt as successful as Back In Black or For Those About To Rock because to me Flick Of The Switch remains one of the best hard rock albums ever recorded.

B00005V0X5|5.0|This is probably Megadeth's most undderated album.Although Hit Parader magazine was smart enough to put this in the Top 100 Hard Rock CDs Of All Time most critics overlook this album.Although not as good as Peace Sells or Rust In Peace it is better than Countdown To Extinction which had I   felt was a little too commercial(but still had a lot to like).This album hints at the direction they would be taking with Peace Sells.More punky and dark than either Rust In Peace or Countdown To Extinction, this album remains one of the classics of mid eighties thrash.I remember walking into a record store when the album first came out and I liked the name of the band and was to curious to find out what it sounded like I was definitely not disappointed.I guess Im sort of a wuss which is probably why I like the moderated thrash stuff more than the extremes of Slayer or even Pantera.Still this stuff is still pretty heavy just more accesible which is one of the reasons it remains a classic.If youre a Megadeth fan and dont already own it whats wrong with you?Do anything you can to pick it up.

B00008WT5E|5.0|I dont understand how the official reviewer could say that this album is &quot;average&quot;.To me all the songs are great and even though nothing here could really work as a single thats part of its appeal.There are songs on here are longer and better than most of the ones on  High Voltage and Highway To Hell.Dont get me wrong I like those 2 albums a lot but to me this is the best AC/DC album of the Bon Scott era.Simply put the songs on here all rock and rock hard.Rock N Roll Damnation is one of the best hard rock songs ever recorded,Down Payment Blues and Gimme A Bullet have some of Bon's finest vocals,Riff Raff,Gone Shootin(which has some of the best rythm guitar on any AC/DC album) and Sin City are the 2 best songs on the album.Whats Next To The Moon,Up To My Neck In You and Kicked In The Teeth are all about attitude to the nth dedree. Overall this album is a masterpiece and even better than the classic Highway To Hell.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I am not a QT fan having watch only PulpFiction.  But Kill Bill Vol 1 really bowed me over and I have watched some of the sequences over and over and its the little details that hit you.  <br />- Sonny Chiba and his side kick exchange over the warm sake and Uma remaining amused and at one point having to duck her head. <br />- great soundtrack ...the whistling in the hospital by Elle, the presentation of the sword to Uma scene with the soundtrack and the climatic cliffhanger 'Is she aware that her daughter is still alive' tying in with the music hits you hard .<br />- the Jap anime was superb and of course showing Jap society perversions and cultural idiosyncracies...Gogo's giddle at Uma 'begging'typical of Jap women  <br />- notice one little glib though  ... Uma Death List Five ... the list used in the Pussy Wagon at the beginning of the movie(after she just killed Black Mama) and the one drawn up in the plane(when she was on the way to killed Oren - final scene sequence ) was different ... one heading in Capital letters and the other in small caps .. could QT have put this in deliberately or was there an oversight due several list props floating in the movie studio?
B00000BKDZ|5.0|Coming out in the year 1988, where disposable hair metal trash like Poison and Cinderella, Iron Maiden released what would be the pinnacle of their creative genius, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. This epic concept album brings forth an onslaught of power and emotion. <br />RANKING OF SONGS (*=1 star,  1/2= half-star. Example- ****1/2 would equal 4 and a half stars)<br />1) Moonchild- incredibly powerful track to open up such an intense album, musically and lyrically. Easily ranks amongst previous openers for albums (Ides of March, Where Eagles Dare, Aces High, Caught Somewhere in Time, etc.)<br />***** stars out of 5<br />2) Infinite dreams- a melodic and solid follow-up to moonchild. Dramatic song that is just amazing.<br />***** out of 5<br />3) Can I Play with Madness- Maiden's attempt at a huge poppy single. Descent song, but at times embarassing. They tried too hard and ended up with a bit of a let down.<br />***1/2 stars out of 5<br />4) The Evil that Men Do- 2nd single off album that succeded where &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; didn't. Overall great song, but isn't powerful enough to be amongst the lines of classics like the trooper or hallowed be thy name. Just short of a classic.<br />****1/2 stars out of 5<br />5) Seventh Son of a Seventh Son- Every good maiden albums needs an epic track. Here is 7th son's, the title track. Dramatic and impactful epic track. Easily amongst the ranks of Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Alexeander the Great.<br />***** stars out of 5<br />6) The Prophecy- a highly underrated song. Nice chorus and guitar work. Like the evil that men do, just short of a maiden classic.<br />**** stars out of 5<br />7) The Clairvoyant- a true maiden classic that is a fast-paced rocker that has one of the most memorable choruses (it's hard to get out of your head). I think this song is better than The Trooper or 2 Minutes to Midnight. Favorite song on the album.<br />***** out of 5<br />8) Only the Good Die Young- an emotionally strong and moving close to one of Maiden's best albums. It brings forth the end and ends it on a powerful note. Incredible song. Literary expression does no justice to how great this song is.<br />***** out of 5
0790732254|5.0|Highly kinetic, cinematic and troubling. Enter into the bowels of a marriage based on desperate needs and disastrous chemistry. George and Martha provide the linguistic gymnastics, which, when mixed with more than enough booze and vitriol, combust on the screen with more firepower than any blood-drenched thriller. Here is emotional assualt of Ivy League caliber. The violence is all too real, and the destruction palpable. Oscar winner in several categories, this one bears up over the decades! Recommend for literate, non-sqeamish, mature and loving couples as a cautionary tale.
B00005UEAR|5.0|i'm not a great fan of regular DT so when they have come up up with this album i started to like them much more and they have become one of my favorite bands. The only thing that i don't like is that it could have been a single cd. I liked only a half of the second cd. The overture with it's stupid hymn-like music makes me want to puke. it's not talented music comparing to what dream theater did on the first cd. The Glass Prison is probably one of the best they have ever done and so is The Great Debate. And the soft Dissappear is a great finish for this cd. they could have taken War Inside My Head and About to Crash from the second cd and leave it at that but such great songs as the ones from the first cd make up for the second cd crap.
B00005JLSE|3.0|Great Music. Great Choreography. Great Cinematography. Movie plot is as flimsy as the costumes. Catherine stomps around like a cave-woman. Renee is clearly the better performer. Case in point: Catherine and Renee's dance duet at the end of the film. Renee clearly is more graceful than Catherine. Richard is consistently pathetic as he is in all of his other films. High spots are definitely Renee &amp; The Queen! I wish I would have just bought the soundtrack. I doubt I'll watch the film repeatedly, but will listen to soundtrack repeatedly. Why did this film win all those awards?
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I dont know if the guys were thinking when doing this album or at least some of its songs. Probably the only great outstanding song is As I Am. on The Dying Soul they have taken out chunks of some old songs including the Glass Prison. and they have also added some unnecessary nu-metal crap which totally destrys the impression after the first song. everything else on the album is average and im extremely dissapointed in such a great band.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Ok George...give in a little...release the original (for the die hard fans), '97 SE (for the fans who can appreciate some modern CGI tweaks on a classic masterpiece, except for the han solo bar scene..that's just unforgivable) and the '04 special butchered edition (for the fans who only like Star Wars because of the effects..that includes you, George). <BR>Han shoots first! Han shoots first! Come everyone, say it together...Han shoots first! Han shoots first! Come on, George, you too. Feel the force, show some love.
B000002UJQ|5.0|ok computer is probably radiohead's best record, and of course the most well-known one. there's a reason too: the songs are really good.  from start to finish, there's no song that could really be called &quot;bad&quot; here. this also has some of radiohead's most complex moments. this is one of those essential cds that everyone should buy. plus, you can't beat that awesome bassline in 7/8 halfway through paranoid android.
B00013RC9I|3.0|This is bland music. I listen to everything, but this is like elevator music for people who think they are hip.
0060512806|4.0|One of my pet peeves is some authors' inability to make those hard choices about what ought to stay in a finished work and what needs to go.  By all rights, I should hate Stephenson's mammoth Cryptonomicon, in which tangents and diversions abound.  To my surprise, I didn't mind the digressions.  Much of the novel's charm comes from the author's fascination with unabashedly geeky details and neat historical tidbits.  Stephenson plays the role of that guy you know who always has a cool story to tell.  He goes further than telling a mere string of anecdotes: out of these threads he weaves a tale of intrigue that brings together World War II adventure and cutthroat tech industry dealings in the modern age.  What he doesn't do is tie off all the loose ends.  The story ends rather abruptly, and I can only imagine that Stephenson suddenly realized he had ran out of money, time, or ink.
B00003CXFG|4.0|In a world of cheap knock-offs, bad scripts, and assembly-line plots, Pitch Black shines.  Arguably an Alien derivative, this film could have been another sci-fi, big effects, lame catch-phrase waste of 120 minutes, but it found quality where other films of this genre find crap.  Pitch Black did not need to be this good.  Instead of flat, cliche characters, Pitch Black delivers suprisingly human, unique, diverse, sympathetic survivors.  Instead of a reaching, ridiculous tale filled with pathetic attempts to spark a sense of morality, it delivers a solid sci-fi/horror punch and lets the character development reveal its humanity.  And instead of over-dramatized, over-used, commercial direction, it pulls the viewer into a beautiful, haunting, frightening world where the nightmare creatures are just another hurdle for our heroes (and anti-heroes) to survive.  Granted, the story had some holes big enough to drive a truck through, but they were truly lost in the overall feel of this new sci-fi classic.  Pitch Black is a staple in my collection, because it is far better than it had to be.
B000002L68|4.0|Please understand that I like this album (hence the ****) but I get a little annoyed with all those people who keep insisting that Purple Rain was Prince's magnum opus and that all the rest he produced in the many years afterwards never reached the same level again. There are so many really great Prince-albums out there: Dirty Mind, Sign 'O' The Times, Lovesexy, Diamonds And Pearls that I think it really is a shame to discard all those.  I also think he is on a winning streak with his last three albums: Rainbow Children, NEWS and the new one, Musicology.  Prince may have changed direction a bit, more jazzy and old-school funk, but he is making some of his best music ever, and he is doing it right now. For those who wish he still sounded the same as then: I'm sorry, the eighties are gone.  And do you really, really want to hear Purple Rain again and again?
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I started watching Gilmore Girls about half way through the first season. Of course as a fortysomething single male, I couldn't tell anyone! But as the years have past, it now seems that the word is out on one of the best written Television shows of all time. The first season is of course the best one. As is the case for most shows. The characters are new and you can't wait to get to know them. The relationship between Lorelai (mom) and Rory (daughter) is so real that you can't help loose yourself in their struggles to make it through what life dishes out. The thing that I have always liked most about the show is it's fairy tale approach. The comedy is always there, the too good to be real hometown, the quirky townspeople it's just a joy, and yet it's real when it needs to be, but never quite being a soap. I can't recomend the DVD enough. I'm planing on talking it with me to the nursing home someday cause it (Gilmore Girls) will stand the test of time. Hope you all enjoy it as much.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I am sooo sorry but this movie (saw it on DVD) is just plain lame.  This is the first kungfu movie were I kept wanting the fight scenes to end.  The fights were unimaginative and not gory in a disturbing way, just in a stupid \\"head cut off a dummy and a fountain of blood shoots out\\" way.  And don't tell me that was the point because I have seen \\"the storie of ricky (laugh out load terrifying)\\" and day of the dead gore.  I have seen dumb gore done right and this film just does it on the cheap.  The only gore effect is the above mentioned manequin and the old \\"put your arm behind your back while I chop a fake one off\\" routine.<BR>   Quintine snuck into your DVD/CD collection, pulled out the samuria trilogy, the five deadly venoms, duel to the death, ghost dog, the fatal flying guilitine, the profesional a few of your favorite songs, etc. (...) added some \\"boss fights\\" ala mega man/sonic the hedgehog/mario and made a compilation disk. But the problem is you have already seen all of these movies and heard all these songs so why do you need a demo disk?  why do you need a demo disk of a game you already own?<BR>   At the end of the day the movie fails completly because Quintine DID NOT make the movie he wanted to make.  he made the movie he thought I wanted to see, and that is the oldest of all the traps the devil has set for artists.<BR>Peace

B00005QAPH|5.0|I purchased this DVD because of its' sustained superior ratings in the Sight and Sound survey every decade of the best films of all time.  Obviously, there must be something very great about this movie.  There is but but there are some second thoughts that plagued me along the way.  First of all, I am always impressed by a film's ability to hold our attention.  This is often where the skill of film editing is best appreciated.  I confess that I found myself looking for some scenes in &quot;8 1/2&quot; to move along.  This is a cerebral movie, not an action movie but there seemed to be a fair amount of redundancy.  Secondly, I was surprized by the sound work on this movie.  I made a quick glance at a few other reviews but didn't see any similar comments.  Thus I don't know if it was just my copy.  However, the sound didn't match up with the film very well at all.  This gives the movie an odd appearance of being an Italian movie dubbed in Italian.  Was I missing something?  Finally, the message in this film, for me, was &quot;to your own self be true&quot; which is certainly a valid philosophy; just ask Socrates.  However, it was stretched to come across as &quot;accept me for who I am, not whom you want me to be&quot;.  This message is still a valid philosophy but a bit harder for some of us to accept.<br />Having said all of that, let me praise the movie; (I DID give it a &quot;5&quot; after all).  The acting is terrific; especially Marcello Mastroianni whose air of detachment fit the movie so well.  The photography (B&amp;W) was excellent, as well.  The story is one of a director who has lost his own direction.  As he stumbles aimlessly along supposedly putting together a film,  his inteactions with others and his reminiscences give us an insight to his confusion.  His world is overwhelming him and he can't figure out where to turn.  He is much the victim of himself (which makes the message that much harder to swallow).  As his crisis reaches its' own crisis, the movie rights itself with his discovery of his own self-awareness.  Everything comes together at the end with a message of hope (primarily for the director).  The beauty of the movie is how we are able to follow the character's collapse and rebirth.  It is also in the way we can see the rest of the world through his own eyes.  This is the sort of movie that will expand with each re-viewing.  The DVD contains a second disc with information and reviews about the movie and the Director.<br />This is a good movie that caught me off-guard because I was victimized by too much advance hype.  I understand the hype but it would have been better to discover it for myself.  Discover it for yourself and it will be a movie you'll remember.ovie rights itself with his discovery of his own self-awareness.

B00005QK3W|2.0|Paul Mc Cartney &amp; The Beatles are unquestionabally one of my favorite artists of all time. Having said that, this album simply bores the hell out of me. I could barely get through the whole album, I was praying for it to end. I thought &quot;Riding into Jaipur&quot; was going to be a great instrumental song, and then Paul started singing and just ruined it for me. I eagerly buy any new release from a former Beatle, but this one just doesn't do it for me. I'm so glad I only paid $5 for this, used. If you want excellent present-day Mc Cartney, get yourself a copy of &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;. Don't say I didn't warn you.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|sorry eric but you do not perform these covers with instrumentS.  you should have only use one: your guitar/slide.  you might as well have used a full on orchestra!  don't waste your time on this...buy the originals.
B000002UJQ|5.0|all i can say is that this album is amazing, its definitely my favorite cd of all time. i heard this album back in 2000 and have been into radiohead ever since. in my opinion this is Radiohead's best cd closesly followed by the bends.

I have watched The Cure Trilogy  over and over (bout 15 times)every time it gets better and better !If your not a cure fan, after you experience this VHS you will be hooked!!!!!!!

6302250269|5.0|Starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, directed by Ridley Scott, and released in 1991 by MGM Studios with a run time of 130 minutes, this drama is about independence, freedom, and choices.  It is the story of two friends living in Arkansas, both discontent with their current situation, who find themselves in more trouble than they bargain for while just trying to get away for a weekend of fun.  Their first stop at a night club on their way is where the trouble begins.  After having a few drinks Thelma (Davis) loosens up a little too much and her flirtatious behavior gains the attention of Harlan (Timothy Carhart), who is interested in more than just dancing.  When Louise (Sarandon) finds things getting out of hand in the parking lot she instinctively tries to protect Thelma and winds up shooting and killing Harlan.  Scared and not trusting that the police would believe their story, the two women take off.  After some consideration, Louise decides that their best bet is to head for Mexico.  Encounters with a handsome young drifter (Brad Pitt), an unsuspecting state trooper (Jason Beghe), and an offensive truck driver (Marco St. John), all trigger reactions that contribute to a crime spree which takes on a snowball effect.  Although all of their choices may not be the wisest, it is still amazing to see the depths that each woman is willing to go to in the name of friendship.  Watch as these two women transform from scared fugitives to defiant outlaws.  Nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Actress in a Leading Role for both Sarandon and Davis, and winning the award for Best Writing; Thelma &amp; Louise is absolutely one of my favorite movies!  I give it five stars.
B00003CXCT|3.0|With the progressively worsening prequel trilogy about to end, it seemed only fair to release the original trilogy masterpiece as it was released in 1977. Imagine the collective gasp of all true fans when the beloved trilogy was released twenty years later in a \\"special edition\\" that continued Lucas' penchant for overwhelming computer effects. Tampering with history and many peoples' beloved past and childhood memories.<BR>The news gets worse now that the long-awaited DVD release of these movies comes ONLY with these special editions. I am sure I'm not alone in thinking that the special editions did very little to improve the movie, and actually did more damage than benefit: you might as well go back and re-touch \\"Gone With the Wind\\" or \\"Citizen Kane\\". It would seem trivial to many, but to huge fans of the movie that brightened up their Saturdays so long ago, it is close to criminal.<BR>Apparently, the '97 editions were themselves works in progress, with huge changes expected for the rumoured \\"Ultimate Collection\\" or whatever it's called once the prequel trilogy is completed. If this is the case, I certainly won't be buying that box set: it's already bad enough to be subjected to the '97 editions as the only choice for a DVD purchase. The three stars I'm assigning this project are purely for the original trilogy's genius. George Lucas had captured lightning in a bottle in these three movies, and has gone to great lenghts to tear away at their legacy and brilliance. Terrible prequels that might as well have no real actors at all; increasingly wooden dialogue (even more than the original, that was their only minor flaw); tampering with the originals as the only options for a DVD purchase: stop screwing us over, Lucas.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|A masterpiece. Amazing direction, score, action and pathos. Only &quot;The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly&quot; is a superior Western...of course both films transcend Western and are closer to what Akira Kurosawa was doing with his Samurai epics. And man: Once Upon A Time In The West is EPIC!!! Fonda and Bronson give their best performances and Cardinale is hot as all sweaty hell. A must for any Leone fan. And for the critics: Italians made better Westerns than Americans...ironic for sure, but deal with it. Get some culture, GET this movie!
0593050789|4.0|Menzies has brought a common sense (or in this case a Navigator's sense)to re-examine the widely accepted belief that Columbus discovered America.In a well reasoned and well written book, he asks questions which are pertinent to the foundations of that belief. In so doing, he follows the footsteps of Thor Heyerdahl and Tim Severin in showing that it is possible that factual history may differ from interpreted history. Was Columbus the first to discover America? We already know that the Vikings got to one part of America long before Columbus; so is it possible, as Menzies suggests, that Columbus was yoyaging to a destination already know to him rather than into the unknown?. Menzies may not (yet) have proven his case, but he raises questions that are not so easy to answer. If nothing else, his book is fascinating in providing answers which make a great deal of professional sense.
B00005JN1L|5.0|I thought this was a fabulous movie!  Johnny Depp played a great part... so if you like him... you get to see him A LOT!!  Great mystery, scary, funny movie!  :)  I've seen it twice in about 2 weeks...and I'm buying it the day it comes out!!
B00006ZXSK|4.0|As far as the movie itself goes, this is a beautiful rendition of the age-old Cinderella story. The plot is conventional, without too many surprises, but it was perfectly cast and holds together throughout. The story is set in Renaissance France. Drew Barrymore's performance as Danielle, an orphan commoner forced to act as a servant to her noble step-mother and step-sisters, is flawless. When one of Danielle's fellow servants is slated for shipment to the Americas as a thief (a scapegoat for the step-mother's debts), Danielle disguises herself as a lady of the court in order to exact his freedom. While in disguise, she is spotted by the French Prince, Henry (Dougray Scott), who is fascinated by her spirit. Believing her to be a noblewoman, he falls in love with her, but her sister Marguerite has her own designs on the prince, and she and her mother will stop at nothing to get Danielle out of the way.<br />The supporting cast is wonderful as well. Anjelica Huston as the stepmother and Megan Dodds as Marguerite just ooze with malice and contempt. Their wicked scheming is both sinister and delightful to watch at the same time. The second step-sister, Jacqueline, who in this version of the story is only slighter better treated than Cinderella herself, is portrayed by Melanie Lynskey. She does a terrific job of showing her character's torn emotions, wanting to please her mother, but sympathetic to her unfairly-treated step-sister. And finally, the addition of Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) to the story as court painter was a stroke of genius in more than one way. A friend of the prince, his words of wisdom end up turning him into something of a matchmaker.<br />The film is further enhanced by beautiful cinematography (the opening credit sequence alone is breathtaking), gorgeous period costumes, and a wonderful musical score. The story is not, of course, historically accurate, but then it isn't supposed to be. This is a fairy tale, and in that regard it is executed to perfection.<br />My only disappointment is with the DVD itself. The &quot;Bonus Features&quot; link in the menu is a joke, as it leads to nothing more than the theatrical trailer. There isn't a single featurette, or cast/crew interview, or anything. A movie like this could have had some great material discussing the process of developing this adaptation, the costumes, and casting choices, the music, etc. I would love to know more about the thought processes behind this film, and for this omission I have to drop my overall rating of the DVD to a four, though I'd give the movie itself a five. I almost hope they release some sort of special edition in the future, with featurettes included, though then I'd be forced to buy it all over again. But nevertheless, this is definitely a DVD worth owning. The charisma of the entire cast makes this the perfect Cinderella story.o perfection.<br />My only disappointment is with the DVD itself.

B00000JR29|4.0|Great album! I don't have this remastered version, but I'm speaking for the original. Only complaint: it could be longer<br />Most people know it for the chart-toppers &quot;Shout&quot; and &quot;Everybody wants to rule the world&quot;, as well as &quot;mothers talk,&quot; &quot;i believe&quot;, and &quot;head over heels.&quot;<br />Ironically, I think my favourite songs on here are 2 of the 3 non-singles: &quot;The Working Hour&quot; and &quot;Listen&quot;. Funny how it always seems to work out that way<br />A great album

B00005A46T|1.0|i wrote a reveiw after i heard the cd, then i read other ppl's reveiws, and now im writing another. All the slipknot lovers say that us slipkont haters only hate slipkont because they were commercialized and popular, or because they are nu-metal. but thats not the reason at all. when slipknot came out everybody said they were great, and i got the cd, at the time i was also listening to fearfactory's soul of a new machine, so when i heard the slipknot it obvioulsy bored me, like having somthing sweet, and somthing less sweet tasts less good, well thats what it was like listening to slipknot after fear factory. from them i hated them, its because they suck compared to good bands that us slipknot haters hate them. i could see how you would like slipkont if you had been listening to bands like good charrlotte, and simple plan becuase they suck worse than slipknot.i feel sorry for you people who were never exposed to real metal, but there is still time, you can still listen to the good bands and redeem yourself the break off from the slipknot bandwagon of crap.heres some bands to help you do that: children of bodom, slayer, venom, deicide, death, napalm death, godflesh, cephalic carnage, in flames, skyfire, norther, cannible corpse, cradle of filth, fear factory,iced earth,metallica (old),hypocrisy,dark tranquility, kalmah, and many more. good luck on the path toward the land withought slipknot :)

B00005ATQF|4.0|First off I'd like to say this movie is why most people are 'scared' to join any military service, the first half of the movie when they are in boot camp is unforgettable when you think of bootcamp or the army.  It portrays the horrors of what you must endure to become a soldier, and the sergent has a dark humor to him that most people find funny.  From the shooting of the sarge to the killing of the vietnamese girl the film is all drama, very powerful moments when they are getting plucked off by the sniper, and when they finally kill her it makes the mood even more powerful, as you witness the horror of war.  Great film making through and through...Kubrick rulez!
0380715430|3.0|The Mother Tongue was the first major book on language I ever read. I must say, I found it highly enjoyable and very interesting at the time, and I found it very informative as well. However, after I returned to the book lately, with a great deal more linguistic knowledge than I possessed before, though I am not by any means an expert, I found myself astonished by what I was reading. This is a book in desperate need for an editor with a sharp eye for facts, because although some parts of the book are correct, far too much of it is just misinformation.<BR>The easiest thing for anyone even slightly versed in a foreign language to catch is Bill Bryson's complete lack of knowledge on foreign pronounciation. He makes such claims as that German people cannot pronounce v's when infact v is a common sound in the German language, claims the Danish name for Copenhagen, Kbnhavn is pronounced Kohbenhawen (when in fact its pronounced Kbenhahven, with a German o umlaut), among other things. He also appears to lack any serious knowledge of Archaic English pronounciation, claiming such things as that Chaucer pronounced a double o as in food. He also lacks understanding as to the arising of pairs like knife knives and grass graze, when any person who has studied Middle English in any detail can tell you they come originally from voicing sounds between vowels (knif, knives, gras, grazen). He also claims as that damp, a word with ancient Germanic roots, was coined in the 17th century. In short, he appears to possess next to no real knowledge on the subject of English language history, or foreign, for that matter.<BR>Less trival for someone writing on language is his lack of understanding in the area of verb conjugation and form. He makes the claim that I am driving is in the present tense, when any language student can tell him that I am driving is an auxillary tense utilizing the present participle of drive. Similarly his claim that the form drive as present tense is found in to drive, would drive, will drive, is absurd. to drive is an infinitive, would drive a past subjunctive, and will drive a future. They all use auxillaries, something Mr. Bryson was apparently not informed about during his research for this book.<BR>The author also shows an amazing lack of common sense at points, claiming that -gry in angry and hungry is a sufix, when anyone can see that it's a contracted form of hungery and angery, thus the sufix is not -gry but the extremely common -y.<BR>The book does have its good points. (...)<BR>In short, this book must be read with a grain of salt. Any serious language student will find himself in disagreement with it often on technical details, in which he will be himself in the right. However, these errors do not totally outway the book as a whole, and so it should be a welcome introduction to any library.
B00005JM02|3.0|Usually i stay a safe distance away from anything to do with Disney and the main reason i decided to give 2 hours to Nemo was for being curious about how far Pixar technology has gotten (the last i had watched coming from them was Toy Story).<br />   I was expecting to drown in cheesiness and cleancutness to be frank, and yes to a certain degree that did happen but not to a level where i had to resort to fast-forward techniques.<br />    Technically speaking &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a masterpiece. The animation is truly spectacular and this technology is probably the closest we've come to 3-D-ness in that respect. I don't know how further it can be taken but this is really convincing stuff.<br />   Now, this aside, the sad thing is that this technology is in the hands of Disney and that in turn means scripts with the cheese oozing like nuclear waste through the orifices of your TV set. If you're not cheese-proof that can be quite a test to go through unless you like watching your films with a puke-bag handy. But i imagine most people don't allthough i imagine lots of things that sadly don't apply to this world.<br />    Whatever the case, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; does have moments of brilliant humor, in fact more such moments than you'd expect it to. Plausibility in the story isn't an issue (fish talk, and have human psychological issues, so i guess plausibility goes out the window all the way) so he only thing that remains is whether you can laugh your way through this.<br />   The verdict is you'll laugh quite a lot of the way, but the sudden cheese attacks will function like surprise cold showers.<BR>    Still though, when it hits its target, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is great and thus reccomendable even if it needs to be taken with a (sizey) pinch of salt.<br />    Made to fit somewhere in that grey area where it can be accepted by both adults and kids it struggles to keep that balance at points but does well in the long run.
B000003JAB|5.0|This album was my first exposure to guitarist Robin Trower back in the 1970s. I was knocked out by it back then, and I still enjoy it today. Trower fronted a power rock trio with a very distinctive sound. He is often called a Hendrix clone, and there are superficial similarities. His harmonically sophisticated chord voicings, walking leads behind the vocals, and heavy use of sustain on his solos are all obviously influenced by Hendrix. But where Hendrix was always exuberant and sexual in his playing, Trower has a languid and introspective undertone. I think of him as Hendrix on downers, and I mean that in a positive way. Hendrix was a better and more versatile guitarist, but Trower has more emotional depth.<br />On slower songs like \\"Bridge of Sighs\\", \\"In This Place\\", and \\"About To Begin\\", Trower's guitar work is beautifully moody both in texture and melody. On the upbeat numbers, Trower proves he can rock, but there's still that little edge of emotion underneath. Trower is not super fast as a guitarist--I would put him in the same league as Eric \\"Slowhand\\" Clapton--but he is a master of the \\"sustain and bend\\" technique. He knows how to make the guitar sing like the human voice.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|Long, meandering, and at times downright boring, I just can 't see why this movie was so hyped. Yes, Diane Keaton does look great for her age, or any age, but Jack Nicholson has gotten fat and I found myself grossed out during the scene when they first went to bed. I didn't see the chemistry. And her with Keanu Reeves, I dont' know, it was a stretch. I was also disappointed to see a strong female character like that reduced to a blubbering, bawling idiot after knowing the Jack Nicholson character for only one week (and not even liking him for much of it). This movie had a few cute moments but I wouldn't rank it among the stellar romantic comedies.
0823003035|4.0|As other reviewers have said, this is a good to excellent book for those with some experience in drawing. The works presented, the methods, and the explanations are fine. There is a wealth of information in this book. However, I give this book a 4 stars because:<br />1. It would have been more helpful to have examples of the Envelope and Block-in techniques leading to the Contour WITHOUT overlays. In other words, to see the building blocks/steps as they would actually appear on paper while one is doing a drawing.<br />2. The drawings reveal outstanding technique and fidelity to the models--notwithstanding that even Ryder makes some errors in some of his drawings. However, although this is figure drawing rather than traditional life drawing (involving different levels of time and detail), I feel that the realism and technical skill draw too much attention to themselves. One goes &quot;wow&quot; at just about every work but there is a major aesthetic element missing--call it, expressiveness, soul, whatever.<br />Still this book is a MUST READ.
B00005QDW5|4.0|This is an absolutely phenomenal cd and a must have.  I am 15 and i've been listening to pink floyd for probably 3 or 4 years so the thing that I do notice about this album is that it doesn't flow as well as the others.  The great thing about floyd is that albums such as The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon flow so well and each song leads to the next so well that it makes for a masterpiece.  Echoes is a collection of the greatest hits, so it somewhat takes away from each song.  Still a great cd though.  Could have included songs such as Brain Damage/Eclipse, maybe another song from Wish You Were Here such as Welcome to the Machine or Have a Cigar.  Those are just some of my personal favorites.  I recommend purchasing this cd.
B00007E8O5|5.0|I had to listen to this CD a couple of times before it caught fire with me. I don't know what Jerry Cantrell was going through when he wrote this, most likely an exorcism with coming to terms with what was happening with layne. Needless to say a very well writen and moving CD.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is pink floyd right here.  This is their story to the fans. Their music is unparelled.  It is simply genious the way they mix music and story together and it makes me wonder how anyone would find this cd boring.  It is entrancing and is one of the greatest along with Dark Side of the Moon, Wish you were here, animals (and of course others, all of floyd is great).  I love this album and if you want a great concept album, this is where to turn.
0679442790|2.0|I have just finished reading &quot;The Reader&quot; and must say, that I disagree with the previous reviews.  I'm not a particularly well-read reader but found this book slow-paced and I nearly gave up on it several times.  I also found &quot;the secret&quot; very obvious from the start and not a very believable or realistic reason as to why Hanna would take the blame for the wicked event which took place.  <br />Michael's behaviour during the trial was at times very frustrating and at the end of the book when he could have made amends he failed her again.  I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone but value and appreciate other readers opinions.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I watched this film with my family and our neighbors.  I realized, again, that we are conditioned to expect a pace of input from film that &quot;entertains&quot; readily.  Everyone else in our little audience was bored, wanting something to &quot;happen&quot;.  Complaints were frequent and the film was almost abandoned twice. The end brought amazed disappointment from some and outrage that critics liked it at all.<br />At first, like everyone else I mistook the slow pace for just &quot;boring&quot;. After a while, though, (trying to ignore the complaints) I found myself drawn into the characters' world, relating to their respective plights, and as a consequence their mutual attraction.  Having done my fair share of business travel, I had a way to connect with the characters' plight: I've had numerous seemingly endless nights in strange hotel rooms.  <br />In the end, I found it endearing in the manner of &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; - a beautiful film that connects in a subtle way if you give it a chance.  It's not for lots of viewers, in particular action film junkies or teenagers (unless you're a teenage boy with a yen for a strip joint scene and a beautiful woman in her underwear, pun intended). <br />I think I'll rent it if it's available on pay-tv on my next business trip.  It's a film best enjoyed quietly:  alone or with a lover snuggled by a fire with a bottle of wine - it'll pleasantly stretch two hours to a well-spent somthing more...
6300213714|5.0|OK suckahs, it goes down like this.  This flick has it all goin' on.  See there's this dude, calls himself Cyrus, who get all the big gangs of NYC to send a group of nine soldiers each to a big powow in Central Park.  See, Cyrus thinks that if the gangs all band together, they can form a SuperGang and take over the whole city.  Cyrus has the chops, but one crazy dude, Luther (played by David Patrick Kelley, a familiar heavy if you like this kind of flick) shoots him.  Dead, can you dig it?<br />Then chaos erupts and during it all, Luther spots one of the Warriors and screams out it was the Warriors who japped Cyrus.  This leads to the meat of the flick which involves the Warriors trying to make it back to Coney Island, their home turf, alive. <br />Michael Beck, in what arguably was his only intelligent decision in his acting career (Megaforce, Xanadu) plays Swan, the sudden leader after The Warriors' warlord goes down in the park.  James Remar, who has become a familiar face over the years plays Ajax, a single-minded lackey to Beck.  One of the best scenes in the movie, IMO, is when Ajax gets his due.<br />The other gangs are a mix of believable gangs and some gangs who like that stepped off of a chorus line in some Broadway gig.  I refer here to the Baseball Furies, who wear white pasty make-up and Yankee threads.  The climax of the movie is worth the wait.  Jimjam sez check it out.
B00003CXCT|5.0|People are complainaing about the changes to the movie as if George Lucas has made changes to the Bill of Rights, the Bible, or some other document that is actually of any significance whatsoever.  This is an outer space MOVIE, just a MOVIE, full of monsters and ray guns and spaceships.  The more ways Lucas finds to repackage it and make another fortune off of it, more power to him.  The fact that many fans consider this practice blasphemous just proves what tools you are.  It's just a movie, and movies arer made to make money.  Either George Lucas is a great businessman, you people are all massive tools, or both.  Why don't you go put your passion behind something that actually matters?
B0001AP12G|5.0|all i have to say is that kanye is a genius. he could produce my whole album  YOUNG ADAMS TEENAGE BUSINESS APRIL 20, 2004
B0000VAFO0|4.0|This film was way better than I had expected. OK, the special effects are not all that great. On the other hand, the story and the acting are more than adequate, and that means more to me. I suppose  one of the problems with the film is that the borders between good/bad are extremely blurred. As in most wars, good and evil depend on whose side you are on. This film is way too complex for an ordinary horror/action flick. <BR>The film might not succeed one hundred percent in its goal, but it is close enough, and does not fall flat as too many other films do. It is exciting all the way through.
B0000039PW|5.0|like kanye west i got two words HOT DISC
0385510438|5.0|I have always considered A Time to Kill Grisham's best - right up there with In cold Blood or like classics.  This book had the same in depth Characters.  The ending was a wonderful twist.  I would highly reccomend this read.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas is the best alive when it comes to rapping. I like jay z but even jigga has to respect this mans flow. Disc like this dont even suprise me when i hear that its nas.Illmatic will be around forever. Nas is a rap phenom.
B00006JIA4|5.0|First things first. After reading the other reviews, there is an obvious conclusion: what is causing disagreement it´s the 3rd cd, hence called &quot;GH 3, Queen +&quot;. While some people say that it has terrible content, other reviewers liked it, but say it is not aptly to call it a Queen GH CD, rather more like a tribute to Queen, and others have no problem with it.<br />I know that every head is a world, and therefore the same number of different points of view about the same thing or taste, or whatever, so if we are going to judge the 3rd cd, TO BE JUST, let´s do it OBJECTIVELY, STEP BY STEP:<br />I. Songs performed by &quot;QUEEN&quot;: A. The songs included here are mainly those that appeared on MADE IN HEAVEN,and that were GH caliber.( obviously were not included in neither the first 2 when they were issued, but rather on a THIRD ONE). &quot;HEAVEN FOR EVERYONE&quot; &quot;TOO MUCH LOVE WILL KILL YOU&quot;  &quot;LET ME LIVE&quot; &quot;YOU DON´T FOOL ME&quot; &quot;THANK GOD IT´S CHRISTMAS (B-SIDE to the MADE IN HEAVEN TRACK &quot;A WINTER´S TALE&quot;) These are the excellent songs from the MADE IN HEAVEN ALBUM/TIME, that never had the chance to be included on a GH compilation. (Personal comment: I would have put MADE IN HEAVEN, MOTHER LOVE, A WINTER´S TALE here, simply amazing songs). SO OBVIOUS RIGHT TO BE HERE.<br /> &quot;THESE ARE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES ( from INNUENDO, a #1 hit, not included on GH No.2 &quot;I don´t remember the month it was issued for the first time GH2, so that it could have been included there&quot;) &quot;LAS PALABRAS DE AMOR&quot; &quot;PRINCES OF THE UNIVERSE&quot;, songs from the time of GH2, of the same caliber, very powerful, but simply ommitted when it was issued. RIGHTFULY ON A QUEEN GH cd.  <br />II. Songs performed by &quot;QUEEN +&quot;: THE SHOW MUST GO ON + elton john: REALLY, REALLY GREAT VERSION, besides, you get the original on GH2 (just one personal comment: since they included here the version of SOMEBODY TO LOVE + GEORGE MICHAEL performed in the FM tribute concert, and although i know that the purpose of  this is not to be the FM TRIBUTE CONCERT CD, which by the way isn´t out there in the market!, the songs that are performed by QUEEN + ( and TOO MUCH LOVE WILL KILL YOU) that have a version on the tribute concert, those are the versions they should have included here, like) UNDER PRESSURE (rah mix), which is an excellent version, not like the tribute concert, besides you get the original on GH2, but don´t fall under the illusion that they are mere &quot;fillers&quot;, they are of the same level, just different, like ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.<br />III. On the solo efforts: BARCELONA (FM + MC) it is just a very powerful and beautiful song. LIVING ON MY OWN by FM, was an award winning track, DRIVEN BY YOU by BM it is also a POWERFUL track, like the FM classic cover of THE GREAT PRETENDER.<br />Like I said, there are millions of different points of view on weather to include the &quot;+&quot; and the solo efforts on the 3rd CD, and the 3rd cd onto the BOX SET, there are different tastes, but the tracks included here have earned the right to be on this 3rd GH CD, and the cd on the set.<br />As for the first and second cd, there is nothing much more to say, in the sense that since you are buying them, it is because you like this kind of music(magic!), and it gives you a general look at the band´s best work during their reign. Of course, there is always one or two songs that you say I would have put this song instead of this one, but not changing the main body of the cd´s. But because they are to please the most people possible, they select the most popular tracks. <br />Alson highly recomended for newcomers, because this will introduce you very well to QUEEN´S music,(they have selected the most popular tracks, so you can have a general look at the best work of the band). And to those who just like excellent music<br />P.S. like it says on the credits of QUEEN ROCKS&quot;of course, NO ONE BUT YOU is another story&quot;, an extremely powerful and beautiful  track, tribute to freddie and others like Princess Diana who died before their time. Included on GH3<br />P.P.S Although I don´t own it on this format, It is a better way to do so, because every cd is a must, and if you get 3 for the price of 2, and as a part of a nice boxed set package, it´s a better deal.
B000021Y77|1.0|No spoilers ahead:<br />The story tells of a boyfriend who is in debt. Coming to terms that he will not pay off the debt with only 20 minutes remaining, his girlfriend runs to his aid to try and get the money before time is up. The plot is told three times over to exemplify three different possibilities of what can happen. <br />I'm almost shocked at the abundant amount of raving reviews for this terrible film. I'd like to make a fair review based off of the insight and interesting things about the film, but I honestly fail to see any. For this I can only pick at it:<br />The Music: I'm a big fan of electronic music, so I may hold high standards in this regard, but nonetheless, if you're trying to sport  a film with any bit of taste, I fail to see the reason for using terrible beats laden with god-awful cheesy lyrics that just kill the mood. Often the lyrics just made me laugh. <br />The Animation: How arbitrary! I love experimental film, collaging styles and testing waters - but c'mon! Can anyone give me a reason why 10-seconds worth of clips of animation were used in the film? Anyone at all? I'm sorry, but if you want to use animation, use it, but exploit what animation offers, and let it integrate further, even if you use it for just one scene. Even so, watching a cartoon Lola run, then the live-action Lola run just made the live-action one look ridiculous and unexciting in comparison (especially considering how rigid and stern that actress runs).<br />The Characters: Most of the characters have no development and are boring. I don't care if the characters were only used to develop a different story for each of the three sections, but there was nothing to grab on to. Far be it for me to criticize the alternative lifestyles of the characters (ie, Lola's distracting and childish red hair and clothes), but let it not dissuade too much from the terrible acting throughout the film. <br />The Plot: Laying out the same story three times over was just overkill. The plotwasn't interesting the first time, and it certainly did not retain any value a second and third time over. For a plot so plain and uninteresting, I don't see the point in exhausting the ending possibilities, or outcomes. For this, why stop at three? And the third outcome was just too ridiculous for me. <br />The Running: If I see that girl running down the street, I'm gonna run her over myself and save us all the redundancy. The running was never exciting, and it is FAR from action-based as the heart pounding music makes it appear to be. It was way overdrawn and it got to be slavish to watch her going and going.
B00005MAM2|5.0|The day I saw this movie I was in shock and filled with excitment. Before, I never saw an anime or knew what it was, I thought it was no more than japanese Disney. In the the end of the 80's is when I saw Akira and I loved anime ever since. This movie makes you not want to get up out of your seat and possibly lead you to soil your pants. The only thing I don't like about the special edition is the remastering of the original english dubbing. The old dubbing had more character and brass which helped me love it so much, with that extra umph I marvelled this movie for a very long time. Get it!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I walked into this movie never seeing a tarentino movie before, and I was blown away by the amazing cinematography, no holds back fight scenes, and just sheer thrill ride of a movie.  My friend on the other hand, thought i was disturbed as I laughed when the resturant manager was \\"ice skating across the bloody glass floor.\\" Yes this movie may be for the more disturbed minds, and since then ive seen tarentinos other movies (except Jackie Brown, but hoping to soon), and i love those as well (i realized his actual style too). Some people dont like this movie, and i can understand, some people are just really uptight (even though the blood is pretty fake and just for good fun).
B00008RV1L|5.0|American Psycho...murder, clubs, sex, drugs, and 80's right? Wrong. A lot of people saw the title and must of thought about 'oh just another kill movie.' No. American Psycho is not a killing spree movie. It is a well plotted film, and since being a huge fan of the book, I thought this movie hit the book like a hammer on a nail. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is smart, intelligent, rich, and lives the life that most people can only dream of. He is everything I thought of Patrick Bateman in the book. A couple of things that they missed was Patrick Bateman's excessive details; The Patty Winters Show, and what he wears and what his friends wear. I guess that the screeplay writers didnt want to bore the audidence with his excessive detail about everything he see's as in the book. The story takes place in NYC in the 80's with him going to fancy dinners, and work. Although we dont know what he does since Bret Easton Ellis didnt want to tell us what Patrick Bateman did for a living. So there are times where he does talk to his fiancee Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon, which I think she tried a little to hard during the upsetting parts in the film), and he is always mistakn for someone who works wirh him since they all look alike; slick back hair, designer clothes, nice bodies, and good looks. Some of the disturbing parts is when he does kill, but I felt that the movie was not too violent enough like the book. The book was full of gore and I didnt mind seeing it in the movie, and the sex scenes were not up to par with the scenes in the book, but if it was then, American Psycho would of have been rated XXX because the scenes in the book describe sex like it is shown in XXX rated films. In all, the movie was beautifully described and tell told. Now in the end, it is where you have to think, bur I am not going to spoil the ending because it is very strange but yet very entertaining.
0440236738|4.0|This is the second novel I have read of Coben's and the best so far.  This story had me hooked on the first page and addicted until the ending - which was the best of many twists through out the book.  Coben has you really caring about the main character, Will Klein and wanting to find out all the answers as much as he did.  I thought a few times that I had figured out an answer only to have Coben surprise me with something different.  I look forward to reading much more from this author.

B00005R8FI|4.0|this rock classic withstood the test of time flawlessly. john mayall  along with johnny almond make california a masterpiece in the same vein as al kooper and mike bloomfield in there super session masterpiece... funny  thing  how many lovers of the blues still seek out there sages when they wish to hear the real things....
B00005J6UP|3.0|This is mediocre, at best. Watchable, yes, with children, but just barely. The plot is very predictable. The ending is weak. The effects are marginal (some are downright bad). The editing is not very good, either. If it weren't a serious attempt, it almost could be a classic late night show (which is not always a good thing). Pass this one by.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It's about time...but why are they only releasing the special editions?  I'd like to have the *original* versions to be honest.  They could have fit both.  Most of the stuff they added in '97 seems out of place, but oh well.<br />The box design for the UK release looks *much* better, by the way.<br />This will be my 5th time buying this trilogy.  I wonder how many times George will find it ncesessary for us to buy it in the future.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|OK, yes, I'm nearly 50, I admit it and more than a little fuddy duddy but... is it absolutely necessary to include such graphic strip joint scenes in a movie?  It's a beautiful movie, I fell in love with both characters and their lives and friendship; it was, as one reviewer wrote, &quot;perfume&quot;.  But... is it absolutely necessary to include such graphic strip joint scenes in a movie?
B00003CXCT|5.0|For anyone interested...there is an online petition to release the original trilogy on dvd.  Personally, I'd gladly buy both versions.  Just search for \\"original trilogy\\" on a search engine, it should come up.<br />There are parts of the special editions that I like, but other parts I didn't.  For instance, the song in Jabba's Palace in Return of the Jedi made no sense whatsoever, and was incredibly awkward and disturbing.  Jabba may be amused by that sort of thing, but I'm not.  Then again, everything added to The Empire Strikes Back worked perfectly...nothing was too big to distract from the film, only enhance it.<br />I'd just like to see the movies the way I saw them growing up.
0452285186|5.0|I LOVE this book! I would love to see him make more like this one!...maybe turtles, or baby chicks? And for some reason, it cheered me up...in a sick and twisted way! THIS IS A MUST HAVE!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|This was if not the greatest, one of the greatest WrestleMania's of all time. Sure, Brock-Goldberg sucked, but Austin stunnin' both of them was awesome. The Triple-Threat Main Event was, (in my view), the GREATEST main event of all time. This match by itself made up for all the semi-crappy matches. The U.S. title opener was great. Yes, Big Show DOES suck. The two tag title matches were pretty good, but it would have been nice if one of the two would have changed hands. Rikishi and S2H??? Give me a break... That one hurt. Rock and Sock vs. Evolution was a good match, but it had the wrong result. I expected more out of the Great One. The evening gown MATCH itself wasnt all that great, but the four women involved in the match, parading around in lingerie was attention-keeping for the five minutes they were in the ring. Taker/Kane was nothing compared to their WM14 battle. It was nice to see a tombstone again though... The women's championship was actually a pretty good match, and watchin Molly get her head shaved was worth it. Y2J vs. Christian was an great match, and their Backlash match will be even better. And who could have predicted THAT ending...WOW...Trish as a heel will be interesting. The Cruiserweight match had a lot of crazy little high-flying S.O.B.'s. This match should have been longer... Rey got Robbed!!! Still a good match though. Eddie Guerrero/Kurt Angle was possibly the greatest NON-mainevnt/final match ever. I was rooting for Kurt, but i had to stand up and applaud the effort of both guys. What a Match!!!!! Sure, this event lacked in some areas, but there were some of the greatest matches in the history of the business in this event...<BR>Thank You Vince!!!!!!!
0385510438|5.0|I am not going to summarize the book, that has been done enough, I don't normally do that in my reviews.......anyway, I really enjoyed this book. I was surprised at all the mixed reviews I read on Amazon as well as some papers and magazines. I thought this was one of Mr. Grisham's best. I have to admit, for you skeptics out there, I have always been a fan of Mr. Grisham's, but I have felt his last few books have not lived up to my expectations. I think this one is WONDERFUL. I think Mr. Grisham is just a great storyteller, and this was one great story. The charcters were believable and interesting, and the story itself grabbed my interest and would not let go. I for one am thrilled to have a Grisham book that rates up there with A Time to Kill, The Firm,and Pelican Brief. This book will join my stack of Grisham's that I like to reread, just for the enjoyment of a good story.
006054094X|5.0|The author is a magnificant reviewer of the real history, through the viewpoint of a non-expert in history and safely, I would say, provides the essential alternative point of view, supported by proofs that many chose to ignore.<br />This book highlights the importance of looking at history not just from written records but searching for evidents through reviewing past maps, historical evidents, geographical evidents etc. These tools are available to us yet we refuse to use them when we explore our histories.<br />This book also send a good mockery to the history of the Columbus and of course requires the USA to rewrite their history, most importantly, to correct the error in their history text. I spent many years reading the history of the USA and found that most texts prefer to view the landing of Columbus as the first, the &quot;migration&quot; wave as essential. However, very little was mentioned about the hardship they had brought to the Red Indians, other than they reversed their claims that the Red Indians were hostile to them.<br />In turn, I find it a further mockery to the USA history that many rejected migrants from other parts of the world, namely Mexico and Orientals while their early species populated the land that was previously occupied by a once powerful empire. I was further amazed by how the US treated the Mexican as invasion when many states that they were holding now were actually belonged to the Mexicans.<br />Why do they need to hide these histories from their generations? Gavin Menzies started this revolution to show us that a Non-USA American (I refuse to use the word Americans as South and Central Americans, are still Americans), can see better than the USA does. It highlights to us that we should really review our history text and teach our children the actual fact.<br />Let Columbus be a history since there were flaws in his character and he had been enjoying too much fame for something that he hadn't been that great for. It's a hard piefor many of us to take, but in reality, the truth prevails.<br />Long live Gavin!
B00015HVI8|4.0|The 6th season of SG-1 has some great episodes, but is more for the hardcore fan than the casual one given the advancement of several plotlines at once.  I say this as someone who didn't start watching the series until midway through season 5; until I'd had a chance to catch up through the DVD sets and SciFi network marathons many of the plots just didn't make much sense as standalone work.  Comprare this to the first few seasons - where the team is more intent on exploring the galaxy, and as such the producers must give you enough background information in the episodes to keep up - and it's the primary reason I take one star off on this year.<br />That said, there are some classics in the season in which actors finally get to act - one of the few valid critiques of a great series in which plot has usually taken precedent over individual accomplishment.  Abyss is the first episode in seasons in which Richard Dean Anderson, confronted with being killed over and over again, has to show depth in his repeated encounters with Michael Shanks as his one potential escape route.  The Other Guys probably made many scifi fans cringe as they saw a little too much of themselves in the geeky guest stars (John Billingsley, Dr. Phlox of Enterprise fame) rescuing the mighty SG-1 team.  The Changeling gives a great acting platform to Chris Judge as Teal'c confronts an alternate universe for himself - and you finally get to see what Chris Judge acts like when he goofs off.  And of course, Full Circle is one of the outright best episodes of the series as two or three plotlines finally resolve themselves and Michael Shanks returns.<br />I'll echo what has been said elsewhere - the media quality on this set is actually quite good, especially compared to season 1, where my DVD player has had problems.  My only gripe - one that I've had for several of the DVDs - is I wish they'd included more outtakes and behind the scenes work.<br />Net net, clearly worth a buy if you're a decent fan.
0783225792|4.0|This is another great gangster film. It follows Ace Rohestein and Nicky Santoro and there rise and eventual fall in Las Vegas. This is a great gangster flick, the first hour plays as sort of a documentary about how the gangs influenced las vegas and the corruption that went on. The next two hours show how Rohestein and Santoro eventually fall. So next time you want to watch a good movie, get casino. Its a sure fire crowd pleaser.
B00018D44U|2.0|Its amazing how mediocre material performed using mediocre arrangements can make a great talent sound... well, mediocre. Wait for her third album and hope it has the inspiration evident in the first.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Ah scarface, one of the most violent and profanity filled movies of all time. Its also one of the best. Pacino gives a great and unforgetable performance as Tony Montana, a cuban immigrant to the U.S. Tony becomes involved with drug rings and eventually takes over his former &quot;Boss&quot;es operation. If your a fan of gangster films and you've never seen Scarface then you cant really call yourself a gangster movie fan. This one ranks up there with the Godfather and Goodfellas. So if you havent seen Scarface, go out and buy it right now.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Just so you know, this review is for the Ultimate Edition, not the badly reviewed Extreme dvd.  I'm gonna start this review with a little history.  Terminator 2 has been my favorite movie of all time.  It was a yr ago when I had first got a dvd player and my brother and I decided that one day in the future, we will own the ultimate edition of T2.  We would have bought it right if we had not already owned it the movie on video.  It was not that long after that I heard that Artisan was releasing a new edition of T2 called \\"The Extreme DVD\\".  We thought about getting that after seeing that it might be good.  But after hearing all the negative reviews, we decided to stick with the Ultimate.  But there was a problem; The Ultimate Edition was going out of stock.  Soon on every market shelf, there was The Extreme Dvd in place of where the Ultimate edition used to be.  I guess we can say that the Extreme had taken over.<BR>One day over the summer, I was at a store and for fun, I decided to check if there Ultimate edition in stock.  As predicted, the shelf was full of Extreme dvd's, but under the huge pile of dvd's there was ONE Ultimate edition of T2.  It may have been the last one available in the whole state so I bought right away.  At first, I was a bit disappointed with the dvd.  One reason was because I had first owned the movie on video so I asked myself \\"Did I really have to buy this movie\\".  I know the video was old and the picture was a little blurry but it was still in decent condition.  I felt like I wasted my money.  Also it's a widescreen.  I know 99 percent of people prefer widescreen but I like full screen (but I am willing to look past that). But after a while, I decided to explore the dvd and realize that it's a great dvd.  Hell, it may be the best dvd in the world.  It has got so much stuff on just one disc!  It has many documentaries on it, cast and crew info, audio commentary, 2 versions of the film, Dolby Digital 5.1 surround ex, DTS 5.1 ex, trailors, dolby surround 2.0, over 700 story boards, entire screenplay, lots of features that include the making of t2 from make-p to visual effects, and the animated dvd menus are really cool and much more.  Enough about that, here is the plot.<BR>Its been about ten years since the events of the first film.  The Skynet and machines of the future want to once again to attempt to eliminate the leader of the human resistance, John Conner.  They now send a more advanced terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick).  This thing is made up of liquid metal and can imitate anything it touches by physical contact as long as its something of equal size and it something that doesn't have moving parts; like a machine, ex-. a gun.  It can form solid metal shapes, ex- a knife.  The humans too have sent a terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and programmed it to protect John (Edward Furlong).  He first must find John, and then help get his mom Sarah (Linda Hamilton) out of a mental hospital.  It is said that somewhere between the time after the first movie and before the second movie, Sarah tried to stop the existence of Skynet by destroying the company who will build it.  She was stopped and sent to the psychiatric clinic for he stories of the \\"machine from the future\\".  After getting her out, the 3 then go on a quest to once again try to prevent the existence of by stopping the computer genius Miles Dyson (Joe Morton), who will eventually build it.  At the same time, they must also keep John alive and away from the deadly T-1000.<BR>Anyway, T2 has to be the greatest movie of all time and I am happy have it on the ultimate dvd.  For those of you who are reading this, if your not happy with you Extreme dvd, then I think you should tell Artisan to re-release the Ultimate Edition b/c I am sure that will everybody happy.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Neo wore a dress. And what's up with his \\"DragonBall Z\\" fight with Smith? Couldn't they have stayed on the ground for more than 2 seconds? Oh and Naomi, about them not answering any questions for you, but rather only making more questions for you because they didn't even know what they were talking about so they tried to confuse you and sound all smart and deep when really all they needed to say at the end was ..... THIS MOVIE WAS A WASTE OF TIME! PLEASE FORGIVE US FOR WASTING YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY AND YOUR DAY! Don't you want something to talk about at the end of a movie rather than . . . \\"What the heck just happened?\\" I loved the 1st Matrix and after the first 40 minutes of the second one, I liked that one too. But c'mon . . . all of you die-hard (...) Matrix fans need to open your eyes and see that they should have stopped after the first one. The first Matrix was something new and exciting. But why over-do it with two more? Neo tore things up in the first two movies . . . why does he have to be a dress maker all of a sudden in the third movie? And to top all of that off, a sunset arises and a stupid girl says, \\"Look fake oracle, I made that for Neo. HUCK!\\" Did I just waste 5 minutes typing a review about the worst movie I've seen (...) But Matrix Revolutions made me cry! Actually, I had wasted so much time seeing the movie, I didn't even bother crying. Don't waste your time with this movie. And if you already have ... you don't have to anymore.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|A friend of mine first introduced me to Muse by sending me &quot;Thoughts of a Dying Atheist&quot;, which got me looking for more of their stuff. At the time I didn't think it could get better than that song, then I heard &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot;, which is beautiful. Muse is very heavily influenced by Radiohead, and at points, Bellamy sounds exactly like Thom Yorke. This is not a bad thing. Muse's music sounds like something Radiohead would have done a while ago and didn't release it. There's a lot of orchestration in the music. Lots of pianos and strings, along with the great guitars, bass, and drums already there. This is a CD best listened to all the way through, like some of the best albums in the history of music. It's not that the songs aren't amazing by themselves, it's that as a part of a whole, (read, 'Absolution'), they seem to take on a whole new meaning.<br />All the songs on this CD are worthy of listening to, but the ones that stand out to me are: &quot;Sing for Absolution&quot;, &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;, &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot;, &quot;The Small Print&quot;, and &quot;Thoughts of a Dying Atheist&quot;
B00005B4GU|4.0|'Amnesiac' was recorded at the same time as 'kid A', and there were talks on it's release that they were just the reject songs from 'Kid A', songs that maybe, MAYBE could have been a lazy cash-in on their part. Thom Yorke assured people that this wasn't true, And I suppose I believe him. But even if it is true, I'd like to say 'WHO CARES?'<BR>  Amnesiac is a great album, yet another great album from a great band. It starts strongly with the mellow 'Packt like Sardines in a Crushd tin box' which, despite it's slowness, is quite quite angry. The first single 'Pyramid song' has beautiful pianos and enchanting vocals from Thom Yorke's still brilliant (but increasingly slurry)singing voice.<BR>   'Pulk/pull revolving doors' is.....weird....yet listenable, and the epic, fantasmic 'You and whose army?' follows. This is the first song which gives you a feel for the rest of the album.<BR> The last track, 'Life in a glasshouse' is the one that I first loved on this album, but it is 'Like spinning plates' that is my personal favourite: So chilled-out, so cool...<BR>  The thing I like most about amnesiac is that I hated it when I first got it. I mean, I loathed it. I'm a major Radiohead fan but my God, I thought it was some sick music project for a school for kids with learning disabilities.<BR>   But I was only thirteen, and as I grew up I grew to love this album. It's not 'OK computer', and it's not 'The bends', but it wasn't supposed to be (And it's still about as good). This is Radiohead at their most Radiohead-ish. Do you think U2 or the Chillis could pull off this album? Of course not, no-one could, apart from Radiohead.<BR>   My review doesn't really do justice for a genuinely fine piece of music. Thank you.
B000002U8G|5.0|Though Obscured by Clouds was released after it, Meddle is considered the album that really preceded Dark Side of the Moon musically. Six great cuts, including the marathon &quot;Echoes&quot; are the reason this is an amazing album<br />One of These Days - A great rocker. Crank it in your car stereo. Features Nick Mason's only vocal appearance: &quot;One of these days i'm gonna cut you into little pieces&quot;....<br />A Pillow of Winds - A beautiful ballad. &quot;Sleepy time in my life/with my love by my side/and she's breathing low&quot;. Also nice to fall asleep to. <br />Fearless - I really like this track, and I don't exactly know why. Nice and soft like 'Pillow' but with a tad more energy<br />San Tropez - A kind of jaunty, uplifting song that will take you away to some island in the sun. <br />Seamus - Featuring a dog as one of the lead vocalists, I believe Seamus was voted 'worst song ever' by some magazine. Yeah, its not one of my favourites, but its funny in its own way. Check out the version on 'Live in Pompeii' called &quot;Mademoiselle Nobs&quot;....its hilarious, with Rick Wright trying to hold down the wriggling Nobs as she whines along to Dave Gilmour's harmonica.<br />Echoes - Taking up all of side 2, echoes is simply a masterpiece. Here is something really cool: Rent/buy the 2001: A Space Odyssey DVD. Go to the chapter called &quot;Jupiter&quot;. As soon as it starts (A black screen that says jupiter in white), start Echoes. If you've timed it right, you will eventually see that they are synchronized. ie. stuff in the movie seems to coincide with changes in the music. It won't be noticeable for several minutes, but it gets better as it goes along, especially in the final scenes of the movie. Echoes even ends at the exact second as the movie ends. Though Floyd never confirmed that this was intended, its much too obvious to be conincidental. PS...works even better if you're high.
B0001HAISG|4.0|Make no mistake, I thought this movie was wonderfully done.  It was beautiful, well written, well cast, and fun.  My only complaint was the shooting by Captain Hook.  My mother had taken my nephew to it, and had said it was great, but warned me there was a lot of swordplay.  That didn't bother me (my 3 1/2 year old loves to pretend swordfight) as long as it wasn't gory.  What surprised me was that Captain Hook shoots 3 or 4 people (all crew members, I think, but my memory is a little foggy) and you see the people die fairly close up.  I found that shocking - and it required a lot of conversations with my preschooler later.  Some parents probably won't mind it, but we are fanatical about not having pretend gun toys, or letting our kids watch things with shooting.  The way we explain it is that swordplay is OK, because we know it's pretend.  Nobody died today in a swordfight.  Same thing with lasers in Buzz Lightyear - it's obviously fantasy, nobody gets hurt by laser guns.  But people die from gunshots every day, it's sad, not entertainment, and we don't want our children to mix up the fantasy and reality of guns.  They'll get numbed by the news when they're older, for now, if they see a gun we want them to think \\"Danger!\\", not \\"Wow, that's like Captain Hook's\\".  Rant done, now back to overall, it's a wonderful film.
B000024D4R|5.0|One of the great things about Pink Floyd is that each of their albums has its own distinct personality. Obscured by Clouds is nice on a lazy day, Ummagumma is great for tripping out, and Dark Side is good, well, just about anytime. Animals is the album you want to listen to if you just want to go crazy and rock out.<br />Though bookended (in true Floyd style) with the soft and simple &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot; tracks, the central 3 cuts offer about 40 minutes of energy that just doesn't let up.<br />Dogs is a phenomenal 17 minute rocker that will make you angry at any fatcat that has tried to step on the little guy. Luckily, in the song, said fatcat (fatdog?) dies an agonizing death. <br />Pigs (Three different ones) and Sheep don't let up either. The latter is my favourite song on the album. It starts off nice and quiet and you think its gonna be a snoozer, but it picks up pretty quick. And just wait til you get to those riffs at the end....aaah, they're so satisfying.<br />So yeah, buy this album.
0393057658|5.0|Moneyball is simply one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. It's primarily about baseball, but its lessons transcend sports. Through the examples of Bill James, Dick Cramer, Voros McCracken, and AVM Systems, it shows how Billy Beane has been able to maximize the market of talent with a minimum of spending. It also gives a great insight into Beane, a classic five-tool player in high school who couldn't convert it into a successful major league playing career. Beane took the lessons learned the hard way from his playing days and has applied them as the General Manager of the Oakland Athletics. The point of this book is: Think For Yourselves! While most of Beane's philosophy makes sense, I disagree with his disdainment of stolen bases, and his idea of the manager as a figurehead with little independent decision-making ability. Otherwise, as I said, a very fascinating read.
B00005JMSE|3.0|As a passive fan of comics I have been naturally drawn to the products of the recent wave of comic adoptions to hit the big screen. Hellboy the most recent of these was no exception. After watching the film I can see why fans of the comic enjoy the title character but was somewhat dismayed by the lack of back-story exposition that has made comic adoptions like X-Men and Spider-Man accessible to general audiences. The opening scene gives us a brief glimpse into Hellboy's origins but the audience is basically left to guess the stories behind the supporting characters. On the positive side Hellboy is action packed from start to finish but the lack a compelling plot, poor dialogue (Hellboy's wise cracks are occasionally funny but mostly just seem forced) and a terrible ending overshadow what could have been a brilliant project. Undoubtedly the best reason to see this movie is Ron Perlman's performance as it is it's only saving grace. Basically if you are a Hellboy fan this flick is for you, if not save your money for Punisher.
0812550706|5.0|This is the story of an exceptionally gifted child and how he is trained to fly and command battle fleets, and the things he learns as the consequence of his actions.  This is an extremely enjoyable science fiction story that blends future politics, warfare, alien first-contact, relativistic space travel and computer technology.  The main character learns important lessons about might vs. right.  It also shows us how extermely brilliant people can be manipulated by less gifted, powerhungry political forces.<br />Ender's Game is fast paced, easy to read and extremely fun.  It's also interesting to see how Card wrote about things like electronic bulletin boards that would not emerge for many more years.  Maybe he is prescient about other aspects as well?<br />Some of the sequels are good as well, although none quite stand up to the sparkle of the original.  This is a story that you'll compare to many others for years to come.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|1994: Nas drops his highly anticipated album &quot;Illmatic&quot;. Critics were astounded and The Source gave it 5 mics. &quot;Illmatic&quot; became a special chapter in Hip Hop History. And Nas.....Nas became one of the best artists in Hip Hop, period.<br />2004: 10 years after the first release of &quot;Illmatic&quot;, Nas drops this &quot;Illmatic&quot; 10th anniversary edition. All original tracks are digitally remasterd and they sound better than ever. There's also a second disc with 4 remixed Illmatic tracks. Remixed by Rockwilder, Vibesmen &amp; Nick Fury. All the tracks sound very good. Especially &quot;It ain't hard to tell&quot;, this sounds even better than the original. Nas even spits some new rhymes over this one. There are also 2 new recorded songs, &quot;On the real&quot; &amp; &quot;Star Wars&quot;. With these 2 songs, Nas shows us that he's ready to shock the world again, like &quot;Illmatic&quot;, with his upcoming new DOUBLE-album, &quot;Street's Disciple&quot;. I can't wait. <br />Nas is coming back, and with Jay-Z being re-TIRED, Nas is ready to reclaim his title as New York's King.
0743454529|5.0|I am a huge Jodi Picoult fan, and when she told me the plot of this book at a signing, I got chills.  She didn't let me down.  As usual, her knack for details and subplots is excellent, creating a tremendously engaging story.  Though it was clear to me who I sympathized with, I nonetheless found myself questioning my own moral principles, something I remember doing with Mercy, The Pact, and Salem Falls as well.<br />I've become accustomed to Picoult's end-of-novel twists, but the series of events at the end of this one left me reeling.  This may supplant Plain Truth as my personal favorite of hers.
B00005A46T|5.0|This album was far suppiror the there self titeld debut,but sadly no one seems to appreciate it. This album is decidedly less nu metal and takes a more classic metal approce and the results are amazing.And since some ppl seem to take slipknot as a big joke the band has decided to call it quits after there next one(vol 3: the subliminal verses).Sad huh.
B00005JMSE|3.0|I went to the theater and watched the movie last night.  It started out interesting enough and I thought it was great that Ron Pearlman finally got a lead role in a movie, and I also thought it was a great cast for him.  \\"Hellboy\\" is a very interesting character to watch onscreen & examine.  The problems arose by a weak plot that leads to the inevitably predictable ending.  While I thought Ron Pearlman did an excellent job in his role (aside from some weak script points that were beyond his control), the other characters were flat, unbelievable, and impersonal.  In addition, there a long lull in the middle of the movie in which the plot does not progress significantly, there is nothing visually exciting onscreen, and as it turns out contributed very little to the overall movie.  In the end, \\"Hellboy\\" will probable make it to my DVD collection as a popcorn movie, but from judging from the old \\"Hellboy\\" comic book from Darkhorse, it should have been a lot deeper than a \\"popcorn flick.\\"

1573225517|4.0|Nick Hornby gives music a philosophical spin in &quot;High Fidelity,&quot; the funny, rueful book about men, music, and modern love. While occasionally the &quot;top fives&quot; can grate a little, this is a charmingly original, wry and thoughtful novel - an offbeat romance for our times.<br />Rob owns a little music shop in London, which is a good thing because he is musically obsessed -- pop music, he claims, makes him fall in love. But even pop music can't heal his heart when his longtime girlfriend Laura breaks up and moves out. What's worse, Rob has no idea WHY she broke up with him, and he feels mixed feelings about losing her (he cares about her) and her musical tastes (bad).<br />He immerses himself in his rickety business with his weirdo employees (these guys alone are worth checking out the book for). He dates a folk singer. He learns that Laura is now involved with the repulsive guy upstairs. And finally, he assesses his past sex life and romances (the top five, specifically), getting a bit of insight into what Laura's problem with him might be: He's stuck in his mid-teens.<br />Thirty-five is kind of old to grow up. But like many real people, Rob learns that it's change or die (in his case, alone and surrounded by records). &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is a nice blend of musical/movie memoir, love story and belated-coming-of-age tale. It's kind of geeky and pokes fun at itself, but therein lies its charm.<br />Hornby writes a nice, breezy kind of prose, peppered with plenty of pop culture and musical references. Not to mention the top five lists: Top Five Episodes of Cheers. Best Side One Track Ones Of All Time. Top Five Bands or Musicians Who Will Have To Be Shot Come the Musical Revolution. At times the pop culture name-dropping gets a bit tiresome, but it mostly underlines how quirky and mildly obsessive Rob can be.<br />And oh, he can be quirky. He can also be a self-centered jerk, and a bit confused and clueless to boot. Hornby's alter ego is likable for his flaws, and somehow manages to shed a little light on how men think. Good backup comes in his clerks Barry and Dick, who are just as geekily eccentric about music and lists as Rob is.<br />Music buffs and Brit-lit fans will devour &quot;High Fidelity.&quot; Charmingly insightful and brimming over with self-conscious eccentricity. Recommended.or his flaws, and somehow manages to shed a little light on how men think.

0156027321|3.0|I had to read Life of Pi for my English class. I thought the book was kind of depressing and some parts of the book were way too detailed. The parts that were especially way too detailed were the killings of the animals, mentioning of urine one too many times, and Pi's telling of the story without the animals. I kind of liked the book before the sinking of the Tsimtsum occurred, but after the sinking it just got too depressing and disgusting.

B0001611DI|5.0|This 1978 classic horror epic hasn't aged one bit as four desperate survivors of a zombie-filled nation barricade themselves in a Pennsylvania shopping mall. George Romero is at his best in this sequel to &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, as he manipulates his viewers emotions from one scene to the next. This new Divimax edition is a wonder to behold with superb DTS sound and amazing picture quality(it looks and sounds much better than when I saw it at the theater when it first hit the big screen). It's now presented in Romeros' preferred running time of 127 minutes. I have the now out of print 137 minute Original Director's Edition which has footage that adds nothing to the story(even though it's great as well), but I much prefer this new edition. Still one of the greatest horror films ever made, this one should not be missed. One final note: for those of you who think this film has another ending, it does'nt. It was originally written with another ending(where Peter shoots himself and Fran jumps up into the whirling helicopter blades), but was never filmed.

B00005R23X|5.0|Over the years, there have been countless film adaptions of Bram Stoker's classic novel, the most popular of which is probably the original 1931 film (which was, in fact, based on a play which was based on Stoker's book).  Out of all these adaptions, though, I must say Bram Stoker's Dracula is very likely the best. The film begins with a flashback that informs us that Dracula was originally a grand Christian warrior deeply<BR>in love with Elisabeta.  When Elisabeta receives false notice of Dracula's death, she commits suicide, and so when Dracula returns home he finds his love dead.  He renounces God, staking the cross, and as the blood begins to flow from the walls, we find ourselves transported to 1897 London. Young lawyer Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to close a deal made by Count Dracula that involves a series of houses in London.  Soon after he arrives, however, he learns that there is something evil lurking in the Count's Transylvanian estate, and soon after that, Jonathan is a prisoner.  Meanwhile, in London, Jonathan's love Mina (who bears an exact resemblance to Dracula's Elisabeta) is going through a series of difficulties when her friend mysteriously dies and she meets a charming stranger - who is none other than the Count himself.  Torn between her love for Jonathan and her enchantment by this Prince, Mina must confront the centuries-old vampyr with the aid of Professor Abraham Van Helsing and his accomplices. Bram Stoker's Dracula is unlike any other vampire movie you shall ever see.  While most - in fact, almost all - of the vampire movies made deal with the horror of the creature, this film goes for the romantic aspect of Stoker's novel, and from there, it builds into a sort of dark, Gothic romance. The film begins very erotically, and continues so until about mid-way through the film.  Dark, horrific production design gives the film a positively eerie, creepy atmosphere; the costume design is very extravagant, perfectly capturing the times.The special effects are terrific.  The Count's transforms from frightening old man to charming young Prince, from a monstrous man-bat to a gigantic bat.  These effects are very good, especially the man-bat.  The scene in the garden with Dracula's seduction of Lucy is chilling. The score, by Polish composer Wojciech Kilar, is great.  It works very well during the nighttime scenes and<BR>the sundown chase sequence.  The end title song, \\"Love Song for a Vampire\\" by Annie Lennox, is excellent, and perfect song for the film. Coppola's direction is very good, especially towards the second-half of the film.  The cast is terrific; Gary Oldman is an outstanding Dracula, and Anthony Hopkins is flawless (as always).  Mr. Hopkins also has some very funny scenes. Bram Stoker's Dracula is as unique a look at vampirism as you'll ever see.  It is, possibly, even the greatest vampire movie I've ever seen.  The romantic aspect of Stoker's novel had yet to be examined, and I can't think of any film better to do it than this.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I grew up in the type of farm country depicted in this movie, and now live on the East Coast in a town that's too small to have its own cinema. I am starting a monthly film series at my church based on the theme &quot;Trials and Triumphs of the Human Spirit.&quot; I selected The Straight Story for its perfect simplicity and unobstructed view right into Alvin Straight's heart and soul. Other films which will be shown because they depict men who, in spite of obstacles and difficult lives manage to touch other lives in positive ways include: The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, The World of Apu, and Cinema Paradiso. I would love to hear other suggestions.
B00005JMSE|5.0|They got it right! THEY GOT IT RIGHT! Rejoice, for Guillermo del Toro has proven himself to the masses! My heart was pounding as I prepared to go see \\"Hellboy,\\" because I was still smarting from the lame-brained mess that was \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" and it seemed to me that maybe Hollywood just couldn't handle a graphic novel adaptation that wasn't about a typical Marvel superhero. But what to my wondering eyes should appear but a spot-on, beautifully made film that hit all the right notes. Del Toro is one of the most stylish directors out there, and he has remained true to Mike Mignola's literary vision. This movie rocks.<br />\\"Hellboy\\" begins during WWII, when a group of Nazis attempt to open a portal to a nightmare realm and release some nasty, Lovecraftian gods. Their plan is foiled by Allied troops, but a cute little baby demon manages to slip through the portal. Found and raised by the kindly Professor Broom (John Hurt), the demon grows into a massive, bright red, cigar-chomping fellow played by an excellent Ron Perlman. Hellboy works at the Beareau of Paranormal Investigation, where he lives in a cluttered little apartment, has several dozen pet cats, and eats his weight in pancakes every morning. His sidekicks include Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), a young woman haunted by ability to generate fire; Abe Sapien (Doug Jones, voice by David Hyde Pierce), a fey, psychic human/fish hybrid; and John Meyers (Rupert Evans), a rookie FBI agent who forms a bizarre love triangle with Hellboy and Liz.<br />Unfortunately, the Nazi villians from earlier are still around, still trying to bring about the Apocalypse. The trio of bad guys includes an Aryan femme fatale named Ilsa (Bridget Hodson), a sword-wielding assassin named Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) whose body has been turned to dust by constant self-surgery, and the infamous Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden), who didn't die when the history books say he did, and who is now a supernatural occult being with a whole lotta power. Hellboy and his friends are soon leaping from rooftops, prowling through sewer tunnels, battling an army of slithery, tentacled beasts that mulitply as fast as you kill them, and finally heading to Moscow for a showdown in a subterranean lair with the kinds of booby traps that Indiana Jones has wet dreams about. All this action is instilled with a sense of fun and recklessness: characters fly through the air and fling each other into walls, just like in the comic book, and there's always lots of expendable FBI agents and security guards ready to die horrible deaths so our heroes won't have to.<br />\\"Hellboy\\" has a great energy and a great visual flair. Many of the images are ripped straight from the comic books. The plot has been altered and some of the characters are changed (in the comics, Kroenen is a talking, fully-realized character; in the movie, he's been reduced to a silent special effect), but I was amazed at how much this film echoed its origins. Props to everyone involved -- cast, crew, special effects technicians, the whole bunch. I can tell that they had lots of fun making this, and that it was a labor of love.<br />Never fear, Hellboy fans, this movie will not disappoint you. And if you're not a Hellboy fan, hey, give it a try anyway. Guillermo del Toro is my hero.lotta power. Hellboy and his friends are soon leaping from rooftops, prowling through sewer tunnels, battling an army of slithery, tentacled beasts that mulitply as fast as you kill them, and finally heading to Moscow for a showdown in a subterranean lair with the kinds of booby traps that Indiana Jones has wet dreams about. All this action is instilled with a sense of fun and recklessness: characters fly through the air and fling each other into walls, just like in the comic book, and there's always lots of expendable FBI agents and security guards ready to die horrible deaths so our heroes won't have to.<br />\\"Hellboy\\" has a great energy and a great visual flair. Many of the images are ripped straight from the comic books. The plot has been altered and some of the characters are changed (in the comics, Kroenen is a talking, fully-realized character; in the movie, he's been reduced to a silent special effect), but I was amazed at how much this film echoed its origins. Props to everyone involved -- cast, crew, special effects technicians, the whole bunch. I can tell that they had lots of fun making this, and that it was a labor of love.<br />Never fear, Hellboy fans, this movie will not disappoint you. And if you're not a Hellboy fan, hey, give it a try anyway. Guillermo del Toro is my hero.
B00008J4P5|4.0|(...)In a nutshell, Elephant is an enjoyable album in the best tradition of rock 'n roll.  It is simple, driving, percussive, ironic, and fun.  And The White Stripes are a welcome, welcome relief from the interminable, trite, derivative, whiny nu-metal that has overwhelmed the popular music marketplace.  <br />Of course, it's not music that will instill virtue in the young, but there's not much chance of that happening anyway while Boomers control the culture.  So if we're going to ride this tiger to the bottom I guess we might as well have a soundtrack to which we can tap our feet.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|This movie leaves you with a lot of questions and a lot of things you have to come to your own conclusions.  I loved that, it's one of the things that made the first so great.  I had hours of debates after this one, just like the first.  A lot of the things that people are saying were pointless distractions were put in the movie to explain what Neo is.  The indian family, for example, were there to show you that programs can in fact feel love.  Smith possessed Bane to show that a program can live inside a humans body.  Neo was a program that loved.  As the Architech explained, Neo has been there before.  This war has been going on for who knows how long.  How could it not end in a treaty of some sort.  If the humans won, they would have to live in the stone ages.  If they lost, how would the machines live without humans as a powersource?  Neo exsisted to prove that humans and machines could live in peace.  If he and Trinity can love one another, why can't there be peace.  Is this movie as good as the first, no.  It is an expansion of the premise.  Hopefully anymore will come in the form of anime, games, and books.  The first movie took the religion angle, while the last 2 took more of a mythology path.  I would love to see some of the past Neos in an Animatrix format.
B00005K2UF|5.0|This CD will knock your socks off. The harmonies are great and the arrangements superb. As a member of an a cappella group, as well as a trombone player in a big band, I can confidently state that New York Voices manages to combine the best of both worlds. There is not a weakness in this entire CD. Buy it! You will be be-bopping and toe tapping in no time.
B00004SA86|5.0|This is a wonderful set for those who love Klemperer...none of the excessness of Bernstein or Mehta...the score is simply followed and the BRS plays with committment and bravura...I really think the best kept secret is this cycle.  Bernstein never did a performance of No. 8 and 2 that went beyond shallow!!
B00007BK2N|5.0|If you are a Joy Divion acolyte or something of that nature, you will not enjoy this film as much as if you are a devotee of Manchester's music scene in general. Somehow I made the transition from Joy Division fan to dj afficinado, so I found the whole thing quite excellent. What I have noticed is that things grow funnier with time. Steve Coogan's performance reveals itself funnier every time. Example: Ian C's funeral and he says, in the midst of all this gaudy crap, with a straight face: &quot;That is the musical equivalent of Che Guevera.&quot; Absolutely hilarious.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad is a life changing book that is why this incredible book has been a best seller now for over 8 years and is still in the top 20 of all books being sold right now.<br />Kiyosaki will tell you some things you don't want to hear. He is controversial. So is Donald Trump. Rich people are always controversial, but who are the people that make Kiyosaki and others controversial? Certaintly it's not the wealthy. The wealthy agree with Kiysosaki becuase that is how they became rich.<br />Kiyosaki tells us that a house is not an asset. I have to admit that I had a problem with that one myself. I a lways felt that real estate was the one safe have out there and like most, was taught by parents and other early mentors that a house is an asset. Then I got a house and found out that Kiyosaki is absolutely right and so were my mentors. A house is not an asset for the buyers, people like you and me but it certaintly is an asset for the banks, real estate agents, insurance people, the local government who wack you with high city taxes and so on.<br />The biggest problem is that many people think that a big house is a symbol of wealth. It is a symbol of wealth to the bank. Most people tyupically take out 30 year mortgages. How much do you think banks make on that while you are paying for the equalivent of three house payments over time?<br />Conventional wisdom tells us to get a great education and you'll get a great job. Well it started in the Clinton era and has been escalating ever since---downsizing. People who spent tons of $$$ on a college education, invested years in their jobs being servants to their employers and for what, to  be downsized?<br />And then there is the typical way that people invest. Conventional wisdom tries to tell us that we can't do it on oour own. We need brokers (so named because they make us broker with their advice) or other financial advice. Those who do try it on their own usually get bad advice and go to deep, deep discount brokerslooking for the lowest commissions or on the other end pay fees for loaded mutual funds which are supposed to be better managed (HINT: They are not!)<br />Kiyosaki offers a newer, better, more effective way. Unfortunately like some others who have come before him, Kiyosaki has stepped on some toes, the very people who are using your ignorance for their bliss.<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is a life changing book. It is highly recommend for anyone who really wants to survive the new millenium.<br />I highly recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad, Rich Dad's Guide to Investing and Rich Dad's Success Stories (prooves that Kiyosaki's  naysayers are wrong as usual)<br />Good luck!
0553275976|5.0|With the Martha Stewarts, the Tyco/Dennis Kozlowskis, the Enron/Jeffrey Skillings of the world grabbing every headline in the business world, this masterpiece by Tom Wolfe once again appears to be an important cautionary tale of ego, greed, and megalomania, nearly 20 years after its original publication.<br />Wolfe is a master at providing rich characterization alongside marvelous social commentary.  Lovers of Wolfe's other works will not be disappointed.  He's captured the best and worst elements of New York City and all of its excesses, and wove it into a powerful tale.
B00005JMSE|3.0|Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a reformed demon, the product of Nazis mucking around with the occult during WWII. He now works as a monster-killer in a secret US government facility overseen by the wizened professor (John Hurt) who discovered him. It seems Rasputin (yes, that Rasputin) plans to unleash the apocalypse, so it's time for Hellboy to go to work.<br />  I was prepared to dislike this intensely, another humorless comic-book adaptation, but I enjoyed it . Hellboy, though alive for 60 years, is barely more than a teenager it seems, and Perlman gives him a wonderfully funny crankiness. We take unexpected detours into romance-- Hellboy competes for the love of Liz (Selma Blair), a sexy firestarter, with an FBI agent (Rupert Evans)-- and physical comedy. There's a wonderful scene on a rooftop between Perlman and a little boy that's as affecting and funny as anything I've ever seen in a movie of this type. It's a popcorn movie, but a superior popcorn movie. One fault: the ending drags on too long. Also with Jeffrey Tambor and the voice of David Hyde Pierce as Hellboy's sidekick Abe Sapien (a psychic fish-man). Recommended.
B00005A46T|1.0|Terrible stuff is on this cd. These guys are Opeth,Slayer, and In Flames wannabes.Slipknot is MTV hardcore which is a bad thing. These guys are terrible and this cd is NO exception!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I was completely psyched to see Bill Murray as a Best Actor nominee for this year's Oscars and shamelessly rooted for him without having seen LOST IN TRANSLATION.<br />(Sean Penn, who'd been robbed by Nicolas Cage in LEAVING LAS VEGAS when Penn should have won for DEAD MAN WALKING, ended up winning over Murray).<br />When I finally saw LOST recently, I had to conclude that most of my friends who'd seen it were right: it looks great but nothing really happens.  Tokyo is a surreal, fascinating setting, especially when you realize that most Yanks have only seen the model version stomped by Godzilla all these years.  I probably would've liked this film more if I'd seen it BEFORE all the hype.<br /><br />And I really wanted to like this movie too.  I personally loved Murray's first dramatic turn twenty years ago in THE RAZOR'S EDGE and I'd always felt that Sofia Coppola got a horrendously-harsh thrashing over GODFATHER III (I hated it but I also thought she was one of the few interesting things about it--come on, she LOOKED and ACTED more like Michael Corleone's daughter than Winona Ryder would have!).<br />I'm glad to see both Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray as the toasts of the town with this movie.<br />But, watching it, not a lot really happens.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This film belongs in the category of great-cinema-experiments.  Darren Aronofsky's main work here is about cinematography and emotional tone and the powerful haunting soundtrack.  All these factors were just brilliantly done and very moving as were many scenes which portray mental and emotional collapse. These people are down to their last mental threads - their desolation is total and very compelling.<br />Unfortunately the plot and character development here are just too flat to really allow this film to be truly great. Instead it becomes just stark, powerful art-house verite' - not quite a full entertainment.<br />The chief flaw is that we just don't really know the characters very well, so that when they slip into self-destruction and despair it doesn't have the impact that it should.  We can imagine their suffering - they're all terrific actors..but I didn't really feel them - they weren't full, real people to me.<br />Maybe it's that Jared and Marlon were just unrepentant junkies.  Could they maybe have aspired to become real people?  They were flat, empty shells for years before the movie started, so we never see their decline - they were always worthless, and cruel to say, they got what was coming to them.  I don't mean that I enjoyed their demise, but I found it hard to care about them - they were long gone before the story started and were actively digging their own graves.<br />Jennifer Connelly, however, was really heartbreaking. She's just luminous - I have a thing for her - .  Her acting is completely transparent to me such that I feel I'm looking right through her body and witnessing her hurting spirit.  <br />Watching her repeatedly trade sex for drugs was very ugly and disturbing - like a voluntary rape.  It hurt to watch.  So few can tug the hard wiring in the back of the mind that way...she is truly gifted..at least with me. <br />Darren Arranofsky really needs a collaborator to meet his full potential.  I hope he finds him.  Otherwise he'll continue to be an art-house ingenue - and that would be a real shame.
B000002UDD|5.0|i own all of megadeths cds and this is the best one just slightly better than rust in peace.the album starts off with into the lungs of hell {a great kickass instrumental,perhaps not the best way to start off the album but still a great song}set the world afire is a rather good track but one the weakest on the cd,anarchy in the u.k. is well done but not quite up to par with the sex pistols version,mary jane is a great song[one of my personal favs],502 is my favorite track on this cd and my favorite megadeth track after go to hell ,in my darkest hour is my second favorite track on the cd,liar is another great track and the album ends with hook in mouth{which is the worst track on the cd,not terrible but just average when compared to the other tracks on this great cd]my advice is ,if you like good in your face metal,then this cd will not disappoint you.great cd.
B00008WT5M|4.0|Razor's Edge by Ac/Dc is a pretty good cd. It has one of the most powerful and energizing openers in &quot;Thunderstruck.&quot; Some of the other non-weak things on the cd are &quot;Money Talks &quot;Razor's Edge&quot; &quot;Rock your Heart Out&quot; and &quot;Are you Ready. <br />Overall I think you should get &quot;Razor's Edge&quot; by Ac/Dc, because there are some great songs on the cd and it is better than anything else played on mtv today.
B00005JMSE|5.0|(...)Great Effects and Make-Up, Funny & Un-sappy Love Story (unlike Spiderman), and Ron Perlman in his best and coolest role yet. Plenty of action and some heart thrown into the mix. Will be seeing this one again in theaters real soon.
B000092ZYX|5.0|there is so much to say about this CD!<BR>it is not only mind blowing but soul blowing.... the lyrics are amazing and beautiful (espically I WILL and 2+2=5, from 1984) and the music that PHIL ED JOHNNY and COLIN has never sounded better....<BR> if you are a new fan buy this CD...it can lead you into their earlier rock stuff or their later experimental awesomeness....<BR>   either way it is a must have.... <BR>DONT DISRTESPECT RADIOHEAD WITH A 4 STAR RATING!!!!!!!!! <BR>i will eat you alive...there will be no more lies
1577311523|2.0|Tolle makes some good points in his book.  However, he is so obsessed with the present, the NOW, that he fails to realize how our awareness of the past and our plans for the future shape our entire lives, along with what we're doing in the present.  He keeps saying that we must get over the past, etc.<br />Well, if we really took his advice to heart, and ignored the past, then:<br />1.  The Nuremberg Trials shouldn't have been held.<BR>2.  We shouldn't have a monument at the WTC.<BR>3.  We should ignore the fact that Bush stole the election.<BR>4.  We should abandon the 9-11 commission and the Iraq intelligence commission.<BR>5.  All crimes that have been committed should be forgotten so we can get on with living in the NOW.<BR>6.  Any events in your past that keep influencing you today should be ignored rather than understood.<BR>7.  You should undergo hypnosis to forget your life history, and just live in the NOW, keeping notes on your person, and maybe tatoos on your body, to remember basic information, like in the movie Memento.<br />The fact is, we need our memories of the past, and we need to actually _have_ a past.  I agree that we shouldn't &quot;live&quot; in the past, because it's dead (although quantum physicists may disagree with that), but there is no way our minds can only be focused on the present at all times.  In fact, we couldn't &quot;live&quot; in the past if we wanted to.  We could focus on our memories of the past, excessively, but no matter what we do, we're stuck here in the present.  Granted.<br />Perception has three windows:  Past, present, and future.  <br />We refer to the PAST to make sense of the present, to tell where we are and to put the present in context.  Without CONTEXT created by our interpretations of the present _in light of the past_, _relative to the past_, we're lost.  Completely lost. <br />Without the awareness of our past, we sense no progress in life.  We don't know where we've come from.  Much of the pleasure in lifeis the awareness of good change and our own evolution.  If we negate the awareness of that past, we negate the awareness of our own evolution, because we had to come from some state of being to where we are now.  If we don't know where we were, we don't know where we are.  It's like going on a road-trip blindfolded, and then taking it off.  You won't know where you are. <br />We refer to the PRESENT to ascertain what is currently happening, and we project our imaginations into the FUTURE to try to plan it.  That's natural, and Tolle's prescriptivism isn't.  That's life.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This movie is pure artistry, and simply fun from the first credits to the very end.<br />Neither Jack Nicholson nor Diane Keaton, aging gracefully as actors, have seen fit to have &quot;something done&quot; to improve their graciously handsome looks, and the pleasure of seeing two fine actors obviously enjoying themselves to the hilt without needing to pretend they are 30 years old is a rare and wonderful pleasure.<br />Jack plays a 63-year-old &quot;player,&quot; a wealthy record producer who makes it a rule never to date a woman over 30. Diane is the mother of his current sweetie, and she is nobody to tangle with, being successful and wealthy herself, a divorcee who has written hit plays for years. Jack comes to spend a frisky weekend with the daughter, but mama just happens to waltz in the door at the wrong time... done to death, but perfect, perfect, perfect!!<br />Keanu Reeves provides a real surprise as the 30-something doctor who rescues Jack from his heart attack and gets a roaring crush on Diane. It's so nice to see a women of a certain age portrayed as desirable enough to attract an intelligent younger man!! Reeves is sweet and charming as the doctor.<br />I often get bored or impatient with the extras on DVDs--the commentary that takes away from the fantasy of the film itself, so I skipped around a bit. Loved Jack, loved Diane, but would have loved the movie without either of their &quot;extras.&quot; That's just me, though--this DVD is a keeper, and I plan to do just that.
B000148KK2|4.0|I had the opportunity to hear samples of all these songs before the CD was released.  One from some Polish website.  Then I got to listen to the entire CD on Air Canada.  I ahve since bought teh CD and have listened to it for several months.<br /><br />The first thing that you'll notice is that it's a move toward popular music, not the jazz vein where she started.  Like on her last couple albums, she starts the album by covering a couple of jazz classics -- Stop This World and I'm Pulling Through.  Then, perhaps as a transition, she covering some popular singer-songwriter songs -- Tom Wait's Temptation, new hubby Elvis Costello's Almost Blue, Joni Mitchell's Black Crow and Love Me Like a Man (the Bonnie Raitt did). Finally, the bulk of the work is her own singer-songwriting (well, Elvis helped with the lyrics) -- I've Changed My Address, Narrow Daylight, Abandoned Masquerade,  I'm Coming Through and Departure Bay.<br /><br />Although I'm more of a jazz fan, I'm okay with letting her do her own thing.  She's the artist afterall.  In her own compositions she reminds me of Joni Mitchell, especially Narrow Daylight and Departure Bay.  Not surprisingly, there is also a nice touch of Elvis Costello here (whom I like a lot).  All in all, it's a nice combination.<br /><br />Overall I think Diane is signalling her transition to singer songwriting, or at least trying it out.  This is a solid effort and a great freshman effort at that.  I give it 4 and a half stars -- a very solid effort. I'm dinging it about half a star for some of her own compositions that don't quite get there.  But Departure Bay and Narrow Daylight will be classics, and signal her talent at writing her own material.  Most impressively, I think the CD hangs together as a whole.
B00012FXB8|5.0|Not only do I think this is sadly underrated, but it gets even better with the additional footage. I find the 2nd film \\"Aliens\\" to be little more than what one critic at the time refered to as \\"Rambo in outer space\\"-which I agreee with totally. It's an action film-not a horror film. \\"Aliens\\" has no mood or atmosphere, just action, and I can't believe true horror fans would ever watch it more than once, even though the creature effects were very good.<br />'Alien 3\\" IS dark, true, but those who don't like it, or think that it doesn't fit in with this series, are simply wrong. The original \\"Alien\\" is also very dark, which everyone seems to forget.<br />For my money, i'm buying the new 2 disc editions of Alien 1 and 3 only-you can keep \\"Aliens\\" and store them in with your Arnold, Steven Segal, and Rambo movies. As far as \\"Ressurection\\" goes-that film is a total joke and should have never been made. Even \\"Alien Vs Predator\\" has got to be better than that one!
B0001906O0|5.0|In the opening page of the companion guide (included in the boxset), Robert Smith says &quot;I expected great B-Sides from the artists I loved...&quot;<br />I share this opinion too as great B-Sides open the fan up to different sides of the artist or group.  This is indeed a treasure chest of beautiful and lost gems.<br />Why Do I Rate this Collection Five Stars?:<br />Music:<br />The Cure are known for their dreamlike sounds and rock undercurrents.  So here the B-Sides show more depth in this vein.<br />Many of these tracks are unbelievable omissions from Cure albums such as &quot;I'm Cold&quot;, &quot;Stop Dead&quot;, &quot;Sugar Girl&quot;, &quot;Babble&quot;, &quot;This Twilight Garden&quot; (my personal fave), as well as Robert's prediction of the new direction the Cure may take on the next new album based around the song &quot;Signal to Noise&quot;...hope that prediction comes true!  All the rare and forgotton songs show you new found colours and sounds of this great band.<br />Design:<br />The box is beautiufl with an amazing book where Robert comments on all the songs, lots of great pics and the original artwork for the single sleeves as well as a complete Discography!  A lot of time went into this glossy and arty design project to please the fans!<br />In Conclusion, introduce yourself to &quot;The Other Cure&quot;....the songs you never heard much of, the great B-Sides of a group you love!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This is actually a great cd. I admit i didn't care much at first since it is Britney Spears, but after borrowing it from a friend that said give it a chance, I quickly went and got it for myself. It hits really good in my car and her voice sounds really good. Not sure how much is actually her and not synthesizer, but who cares, it sounds pretty tight. Again, Give it a chancce if you want a great dance cd!
078401213X|2.0|Because I dont think anyone else will honestly enjoy this droning math &quot;thriller&quot;. I think some people (reviewers perhaps) have a need to see indy films in an unnaturally good light just because they are indies, and out of the elitist disdain for mainstream hollywood fare. Liking &quot;Pi&quot; makes them feel suave and sophisticated. I agree about most mainstream hollywood fare being worthless (anyone else just see Hellboy? hell is sitting and watching that for 2 hours) but that doesnt make awful indie films better. It turns out that both high and low budget movies can completely suck and Pi is all the proof you need.
B000002KHH|5.0|Greatest f*cking album of all time. <BR>favs: paranoid, hand of doom, jack the stripper/fairies wear boots, war pigs.<BR>I used to listen to gangsta rap because all my friends did, yet i got sick of it, then I searched the net for something unique and solid, to my surprise i never thought i would like heavy metal.
B00000IOSU|5.0|You can tell the real talent of an artist/band based on their live performance. The best thing,for me, about live music is the ENERGY, and this cd has plenty of it. This cd introduced me to Sarah's music and made me a fan for life. It is one of those rare cds that I can play all the way through and love every track. This was my first Sarah cd and I would recommend it as a starter for any new fans. All the good things you have heard about Sarah's music are true. But don't take my word for it...listen to it for yourself.
B000002HPV|5.0|After 'Post' no other BJork album was easy to listen, but 'Homogenic' started to delve into a much deeper and darker note that made her music outright tough to digest for a few people. A perfect example of this is the loaded \\"Pluto\\". However, while being dark in some tracks, others such as \\"Unravel\\" and \\"All Neon Like\\" are, hands down, among the best songs (by BJork or anyone else) you will hear, and \\"All is Full of Love\\", with its minimalist approach sets the stage for things to follow.<br />Overall, if you pay close attention, the album is a perfect continuation of 'Post' and a tribute to good music and great taste. So, where were you in 1997? I was unravelling, while listening to 'Homogenic'.
B00006LWSF|3.0|This the soundtrack to Eminem's film \\"8 Mile\\" starring Eminem, Mekhi P, Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy. That movie is somewhat good; it's about the life of Jimmy Smith (Em's character), who is a struggling white rapper very similar to Eminem in real life in his early days before Dr. Dre discovered him. (FYI - A then unknown Eminem was doing a freestyle on a local radio station when Dr. Dre heard him. Dre was very impressed with what he heard that he put out a manhunt who that rapper was. The rest was history). Eminem is a good actor, he has the potential unlike Ja Rule, who is very OA in \\"Half Past Dead\\". (...) There are so many good rapper-actors out there like Dr. Dre, Snoop, Ice Cube, DMX, Kurupt (he was very funny on \\"Hollywood Homicide\\" & \\"Half Past Dead\\"), LL Cool J, Treach etc. But my favorite of em' all has gotta be 2Pac, of course, he just got the talent and the potential to be a great actor (Just watch \\"Juice\\" - a critically acclaimed film starring 2Pac. This got to be `Pac's best acting). Anyway going back to the album, here is the breakdown of all the songs.<br />1. Lose Yourself - (5 stars) Everybody already heard this one.<BR>2.  Love Me - (4.5 stars) I actually liked this song. 50 surprisingly delivers a decent verse cracking jokes on Lil' Kim, D'Angelo, Lauryn Hill etc. Obie and Eminem deliver good verse. The hook is great on the chorus.<BR>3.  8 Mile - (3.5 stars) The title track. I liked this one at first but this gets boring as time goes on. Another one of those Em' tracks that gets old fast.<BR>4. Adrenaline Rush - (3.5 stars) by Obie Trice. Kind of a decent track from Obie. I don't know how many times he said the word \\"muthaf*cka\\" here.<BR>5. Places To Go - (1 star) Another one of those wack 50 tracks. Do I need to say more?<BR>6. Rap Game - (4 stars) by D12. A pretty good track featuring Eminem. The beat is good.<BR>7. 8 Miles and Runnin' - (3 stars) by Gay-z and Freeway. I don't know why Freeway gets a record label, he SUX (No wonder he SUX because he is from Roc-a-fella. Whole Roc-a-fella crew sucks except maybe for Kanye West). I watched MTV one time and see Gay-z singing the love song \\"Because of You\\" (I found out it was Keith Martin, they just look too much alike. Ha Ha Ha).<BR>8. Spit Shine - (2 stars) I hate Xzibit. I just don't like him. I hate mad rappers like Xzibit, Mystikal etc. (except for DMX). I especially hate Mystikal. He is really angry in almost all his songs but in reality he is a p*ssy.<BR>9. Time of My Life - (2 stars) by Macy Gray. This is just not my cup of tea. I don't listen to this.<BR>10. U Wanne Be Me - (2.5 stars) by Nas Escobar. Yeah he is Nas Escobar here not the Nasty Nas we used to know. This is a below average song.<BR>11. Wanksta - (2 stars) by 50 cent. Another wack 50 song. Why does he call Ja Rule a wanksta when he is also a wanksta (wannabe gangsta).<BR>12. Wasting My Time - (1 star) by Taryn Manning. Again, not my cup of tea.<BR>13. R.A.K.I.M. - (4 stars) by Rakim. Good song by Rakim, great beats, nice chorus.<BR>14. That's My N*gga Fo' Real - (1 star) by Young Zee. I don't like this one.<BR>15. Battle - (4.5 stars) by Gangstarr. I like this song. I suggest you buy albums by Gangstarr cause they are really good.<BR>16. Rabbit Run - (4.5 stars) by Eminem. This song has no hooks, no chorus; just non-stop action similar to that of Tha Dogg Pound's \\"A Doggz Day Afternoon\\". Eminem really rips the mic apart here. A great song to end the album.<br />Overall, if you are a big fan of Eminem, then you should check this one out because Eminem appeared in 5 songs here. And all of his performances here are excellent. I recommend this for die-hard Eminem fans, though not for everybody.
B000055WIQ|5.0|The newer version has even more scarier scenes then the original. I saw it when it first came out in the 70's and to this day, I cannot watch this movie at night.<br />The special effects are so scary, they will give you nightmares, no matter how old you are.<br />If you love horror, you have to have this movie.
0156027321|4.0|I had to read Life of Pi for my senior english class. I think that Life of Pi by Yann Martel is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. The begining is a little long but once Pi is on the life boat after the sinking of the Tsimtsum the action really picks up. You are presented wiht many different options about what is reality and what is hallucination. Pi's ordeal whether it was fiction or not is a crusade across the pacific ocean and a crusade inside himself. His depiration and his triumphs are what keeps the book moving.
B00005JMSE|2.0|The movie starts out reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark, but without the charm of Harrison Ford and Karen Allen. After the first 30 minutes, it degenerates into endless silly monster fight scenes. Overall, typical of action movies lately, all special effects and 15 minutes worth of plot spread out over 2 1/2 hours.  Tedious, noisy, barely worth watching on cable
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't even remember this being on-the-air, shame on me.  Buffy is my favorite all-time show and I bought the &quot;Firefly&quot; DVD set on the strength of Wedon's name and the handful of positive reviews I glanced at.  And am I ever glad I did.<br />This show is amazing.  It has all the hallmarks that make Buffy great:  strong ensemble cast, stellar writing, engaging arcs that bubble beneath the episodic plots.  The writing on Wedon's shows is so far above most other shows it's no wonder I can hardly stand TV anymore.  &quot;Firefly&quot; is a shining example of the Space Western genre, with a grittiness that tempers the gadgetry.  Yes, it's got action and adventure and intrigue, but at heart it's an ensemble drama, and it's the characters' interactions that give it life.  And what interaction!  Characters with depth, outstanding performaces, witty dialogue; all the more amazing considering the size of the ensemble.<br />As if another 5-star review were needed.  But when a show is this good, you have to get it off your chest.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is a movie that would be hard to like if it were explained to you in a literal sense.  A movie about a 40 something Italian hitman that falls in love with a 12 year old girl.  But it is much more than the parts that make it a movie.<br />First off the bat it ignores a lot of stereotypes that existed at that time about hitmen, especially Italian ones that worked for a face that is played up to be part of La Cost Nostra, even it if isn't said outright.  He doesnt' wear Armani Suits, eat spaghetti, sleep with high class floozies, or hang out at bars bragging about who he has done in all while drinking shots and snorting coke.  No, he is a quiet introvert, that does his job, and meticulously focuses on his quiet and simple life.  He is illiterate, has only one real friend, cares for his plant like it was a pet, and loves going out to musicals.  Which, the latter is a great scene, seeing a hardened killer smiling like he was a 10 year old boy while watching muscials at a nearly empty theater was classic.  Plus the more you get to know of his character the more you realize he is stunted emotionally, flawless killer, but unable to handle simple social interaction.<br />Natalie Portman shows her talent in her first role as the rebellious daughter of a drug handler.  She shows not only her potential for being a great actress, but intelligence in this role.  Where she falls in love with a hitman and is dead set on avenging the death of her little brother, the one person in her dysfunctional family she cares for.<br />Gary Oldman is in his classic evil form as a drug addicted DEA agent that has crossed the line.  True, he does overdo the character, but that is what makes it fun.  Watching him pop some green pill, chatter about Bethoven, then procede to break into an apartment killing everyone in it was one of the best parts of the film.<br />The camera angles and the characters in this movie are fresh and gritty.  Not falling to sterotypes, they make you feel like you arereally in New York, sweating along with the cop in a bad suit and five o'clock shadow.<br />The love story is bizarre, but works in the end.  Two misfits, that find each other and help pull themselves out of their downward spiraling lives.<br />This is a powerful movie that I think everyone should experience.  It hits on many levels and appeals to many different types of people, people who like to view films as artwork to those who just like an action flick, this movie will deliver.   Though I was tempted to take away a star since I didn't like the additions of the directors cut, the power still holds.  See the theatrical release first, then watch the directors cut.  Afterwards you can pick your favorite and watch them over and over again.
B00005JMCN|1.0|This movie was so lame I couldn't even get past the first hour.  It had no story and the movie was just plan dumb.  What were the developers or even the writers thinking?  How could anyone like this dumba$$ movie?  Damn I can't even begin to think how bad this movie is.
B00003CWL6|3.0|This movie is one that I like despite its flaws.  It has some great parts to it, and some terrible parts that are easy to ignore the first time, but in future viewings tend to grate.<br />the good<br />Most of the acting is excellent.  I like Keven Spacey as the downtrodden father and \\"former center\\" of the family.  A man that was obviously the bread earner at one point in time until his wife started to outshine him and the family lost respect for him in a whole(hypothesis).  Annette Benning is good as the woman is is emulating strength in order to gain it, who felt she was weak and was terrified by it.  So becomes the cold career woman who is terrified and emotionally weak when no one is around.  Mena Suvari was nice as the shallow best friend, who doesn't want to be ordinary.  As well as Chris Cooper playing the unlikable Col. Frank Fitts, someone with serious issues.<br />The basis for the story was intersting.  Characters who pretty much design their lives to hide behind their fears.  The mother fearing weakness, the father fearing he was wasting his life, the daughter and her friend fearing being ordinary, and the former marine being in the closet about his homosexuality.<br />Some of the visuals were interesting, many of them involving roses and Kevin Spacey's sexual fantasies.  But it had a bright, shiny, almost too clean feel.  Showing this upper middle class neighborhood as seemingly perfect until you get to know the people involved.<br />the bad.<br />Some of the acting was great, some of it was flat out terrible.  Thora Birch is attractive in a natural sort of way, but a terrible actress.  I wasn't at all interested in her character, a whiny brat that hated her parents for giving her this opulent lifestyle and wanted breast implants(pick an actress that might need them :).  The love interest was supposed to be this special kid that no one understood, which I didn't either.  He came off as a creepy slob who sounded like he was on the drugs he was selling most of the time.  The scene where he sees god in a bag blowing in the wind was wonderfully parodied in Family Guy.  All the scenes with them just seemed to fall flat.<br />The idea of the marine in the closet was just cheesy, way too 90's.  I don't believe that every person who has something against gays is in the closet.<br />Kevin Spacey's change was enjoyable, but him speaking in soft tones like he was a monk or holy man was too much.<br />The ending was dissapointing in some of the mechanics.  What he saw as he was passing was great, but the dull boyfriend looking into his eyes and the smile he had on his face took away from the other elements that were being portrayed.<br />This was a good movie, but like all good movies it is flawed.  Great the first time through, but doesn't hold up.  It is good for all types, as most people will find someting in it they like, though just as likely something they won't.
0385336810|5.0|I loved this book-it was endearing, realistic, smart and funny. I found myself laughing aloud at the clever situations Kinsella created. The description of the characters and the attention to detail was flawless. The way the author spun all of Emma's little revealed secrets into everyday was life was never predictable and always witty. I think any twenty something girl will relate to this book having once been or behaved to some degree like the main character, Emma. Jack Harper is not just a character study- he embodies that older, successful, handsome alpha-male every girl is bound to encounter at some point in her life.
B00003CXCT|4.0|The original Star Wars, NOT the special edition, is the true art form and authentic Star Wars experience. As spectacular as the 3 films are with or without revisions, the special edition series adds unessessary footage that may help along the plot, but its still murdering what Star Wars is supposed to be. <BR> However, they still are the best Star Wars films ever made. I will buy this only because its the only set offered, but I beg Lucas to bring back the original films and put them onto DVD.
B0001IN080|1.0|This DVD is a joke. I was expecting a concert type DVD a la Diana Krall (live in Paris) and was shocked at the poor production of this mess. The MTV type video shots seemed to change with every note and even juxtaposed shots from differenct concerts in the same song!  It doesn't take a genius to realize that with this, you have inherent sync problems and they were everywhere through this album.  Also, the picture quality was poor (grainy and dark) and the soundtrack of the DVD is not even in Dolby Digial although so indicated on the box.<BR>Note to Michael - your audio production on your previous CD is tremendous but your video production on this DVD is embarassing. Buy the Diana Krall DVD and learn what a musical DVD is all about.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|There is no doubt that some wonderful, sometimes unusual music is composed merely to accompany and enhance the visual experience of a movie. Seldom is the music noticed and when the music is so memorable that, on even rarer moments when it is noticed and appreciated, it still is often forgotten by the end of the movie.<br />I do this, everybody does this, it's human nature, however there have been a very few movies where I was so taken by the music, that I made a mental note to follow up on the score. This is one of those truly outstanding creations, in which, Clint Mansill and The Kronos Quartet have created an exceptional score for the movie Requiem For A Dream, a tour de force of movie soundtracks.<br />After reading a wonderful review of the movie. I was reminded how much I loved the soundtrack. No it's not for everyday listening but when listening to, one cannot help be dragged back to the movie, which was both a wonderful and horrible movie. The music was that powerful. The association between the music and the movie are inseparable.<br />Yes there are numerous very helpful, five star reviews of this album already in the data base but I figure if Evanescence can have seventeen hundred plus reviews, one more for Requiem for a Dream, won't hurt.<br />This soundtrack is both subtle and powerful and I guess I should add brilliant. It is subtle in that it compliments the movie perfectly, never taking over but always augmenting the story. It is powerful because the music imbues itself into your consciousness, so when you hear it you can't help but think of the movie. Brilliant in it's simplicity, being a simple refrain which is the underlying melody for the whole soundtrack. To the basic melody Mansill varies length and musical instruments. Of course the melody is not repeated in each of the thirty-three instrumental fugues but it probably is in two thirds of them, sometimes strictly with strings, sometimes with strings and synths for a more electronica sound and on a couple songs with heavy percussion.<br />A very interesting combination - violins and cellos with an electronic/industrial background. There is even a couple short songs where a conga is used. Of the thirty-three separate facets of the soundtrack many are snippets, under one minute in length. To be sure, only ten songs exceed two minutes and this fact is what some people do not like, or rather I should say, is the reason they do not like the soundtrack more. Hardly anyone doesn't like the the soundtrack, some just wish it had more continuity. This is not an issue for me since the entire soundtrack reminds me of several remixes of the same song.<br />So who is Clint Mansill and the Kronos Quartet. Composer Mansill, was the singer/guitarist for the British band Pop Will Eat Itself which was known for a union of electronica with neo-classical.<br />Mansill teams on this album with Kronos Quartet a well reputed String Quartet featuring two violins (David Harrington, John Sherba)a viola (Hank Dutt)and a cello (Jennifer Culp).<br />Similar to the film, the soundtrack consists of three parts: Summer, Fall and Winter. Summer contains 15 fugues, only two of which, &quot;Summer Overture&quot; and &quot;Hope Overture&quot;, exceed two minutes. Of course with violins and cellos the music can't help but feel sad and ominous but a darker transition takes place in the nine fugues of fall. Again mostly snippets as only three songs, &quot;Arnold&quot;, &quot;Marion Barfs&quot; and &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot;, exceed two minutes but all of them continue the forboding message endemic in the music. Winter contains five songs over two minutes including two three minute songs, &quot;Meltdown&quot; and &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot;, and one four minute song, &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot;<br />CONCLUSION<br />Although I find this to be a most compelling composition, it may not appeal to everybody. It is the background music for a story depicting the harrowing lives of four drug addicts. It is atmospheric, melancholy, brooding eventually becoming darkly disturbing almost morose in following the downward spiral of these unfortunate souls.<br />If you have seen the movie, you know what it sounds like. If not, you have the option of renting the video to hear the music which is exactly the same as the CD but if you do, beware the movie can be disturbing. More so than the music.drug addicts. It is atmospheric, melancholy, brooding eventually becoming darkly disturbing almost morose in following the downward spiral of these unfortunate souls. <br />If you have seen the movie, you know what it sounds like.

0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi is very exciting.  Yann Martel turns Pi into a great single-person character.  The author puts a twist of creativity into a story that appears to be normal in the beginning.  I recommend this novel to all teachers who are trying to find one for their class(es).  This novel can be enjoyed by everybody all ages.  It can also be enjoyed over and over only to realize that it gets better each time.  This is a novel that cannot be passed up and I appreciate my teacher for making our english class read it.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|Truly a great re-issue of a unique album...for those with doubts,this is an album whose time has come.The women are locked into a gorgeous groove at least as good as that on the previous two albums, and Lindsey Buckingham's inimitable contributions are not that &quot;funny&quot; 24 years later, just rollicking good fun.They are all still singing about and to each other a la Rumours, but much of the big hurt is gone, leaving wistfulness, and even a smile here and there, amidst some of the most beautiful melodies and arrangements ever. Ultimately my favorite of the &quot;big three&quot; from this version of FM. Oh, there's a terrific second disc to round out the story.Hook into it now!
B00013F5ZG|5.0|Great album!  I will be buying his next album for sure!
0743454529|5.0|To what lengths would you go to save your sick child?<BR>The Fitzgeralds are faced with this dilemma in Picoult's latest novel. Anna Fitzgerald has always known she's been conceived to help &quot;heal&quot; her older sister,Kate, but when mom and dad want her to donate a kidney to save her sister, she balks and hires a lawyer to medically emancipate her from her family. This book draws you in from page one and keeps you hooked right until the last page. Picoult's ability to take a fairly routine question and shake it up really causes the reader to think and question his/her own beliefs. What would YOU do if <BR>kate were your daughter? Have tissues handy when you read this  &quot;page-turner&quot; that will make a perfect group discussion book.
B000084T18|5.0|Please.  I'm tired of the &quot;50 is played out&quot;.  I'm tired of the &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin' is trash&quot;.  I'm tired of all the people that loved 50 when this album first dropped who suddenly now find it their duty to argue that 50's songs are overplayed and just not good.  While 50 does not have the most lyrical talent, this album has the beats to keep you playing it (while nobody is watching you of course).  Don't tell me you've never called yourself a P.I.M.P. or rapped In Da Club.  If 50 Cent was &quot;underground&quot;, you (the hater) would love this album and tell all your little friends about it.  Now that he's made more money than you... you hate.  Go figure.
0156027321|4.0|excellent adventure that ties in survival instincts, unlikely bonds, and faith.  started out a bit slow and finished on the top.  a fantastic satisfying ending.
B00003CXCT|2.0|George Lucas is such a pompous you know what that it is amazing.  He is releasing this collection, but only with his modified versions, and not even the ones he released in the theater for the 20th anniversary.  They are modified yet again here and he refuses to provide true fans with the original versions that were released in the theater in the 70's and 80's.  What is up with that?  I can understand that he has a desire to add things he believed were missing, but considering that our money and devotion is what made the originals such a massive success, don't you think we deserve to at least have the choice of viewing and owning them if we want?  Unfortunately, the only way to own the true originals is to buy the old laserdisc versions or find some old VHS versions somewhere.  Both are woefully inadequate in picture quality and sound quality.  Therefore, I cannot give this compilation more than 2 stars (and that is generous) because it is not a truly complete collection and just another way for a pompous director to make more money from his built-in fan base.
B00005LQ04|1.0|This was, without a doubt, one of the most pathetic excuses for a horror movie I've ever seen. I'd say about three quarters of it was  nothing but some girls fartin around yapping about nothing. There are just a few very short killing scenes, which aren't that great.  The soundtrack everyone seems to rave about sounds like a few kids in a basement banging on trashcans. I wouldn't reccomend this movie to anyone. I'd suggest movies by Lucio Fulci, such as The Beyond, House by the Cemetery, or Zombie, to name a few.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|After all the hype The Strokes received upon the release of their debut album, you would think that all of that acclaim might have gone to their heads.  Reports that the band was working with Nigel Godrich (Radiohead's producer) indicated that the band might have been moving in an ambitious new direction - however, the band decided to start from scratch and record with Is This It producer Gordon Raphael again.<br />The result is solid without being groundbreaking: It's a collection of songs that sound more like they came out of the 1970's Greenwich Village club circuit than the present day, and if you liked the first album you'll enjoy this one just as well.  It's not the drastic change that you might have anticipated from the band's original choice of producer, but there are some subtleties that expand on their core sound: the synth-like guitars in &quot;12:51&quot;, the disco-ish sounding back beat in &quot;Automatic Stop&quot;, and &quot;Under Control&quot;, which represents The Strokes' attempt at a ballad.  Raphael's stripped-down production suits the band well, and gives this album the same immediacy that the first one had.  Some may criticize them by saying that this album is Is This It: Mach II, but most of the album is written and performed in such a way that such criticisms become irrelevant and you just take the album for what it is: a solid collection of songs with no filler.<br />In summary: No sophomore jinx here - The Strokes release another stellar collection of tunes that serve to justify the critical praise they have received, with enough twists and turns to indicate that they're becoming more seasoned and confident than they were on their debut.
0393307050|5.0|I'm hooked on the novels of Patrick O'Brian. They are fun, exciting, and great imaginative reads. They are not the easiest books to read, but they are swashbuckling fun.<br />In case you don't know who Patrick O'Brian is, he is the author of the 20 books in the Jack Aubrey adventure series. Most recently his books, Master and Commander and Far Side of the World, were loosely adapted for the screen. The movie though great does not do the books justice.<br />The first book in the Jack Aubrey series details the beginning of the strong friendship of Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin. They meet at a concert where Jack elbows Stephen in the ribs, and the rest is fiction history.<br />When Jack Aubrey is promoted to the rank of Master and Commander he is given command of a sloop, the HMS Sophie. Needing a doctor for his new command, he invites his new friend, Stephen to come along on the cruise.<br />The ship is a small, slow, undergunned Man O' War with a out of practice crew and a new commander. Soon though, through the will of Jack, the ship becomes a lean fighting vessel taking numerous prizes while on patrol, briging fame and fortune to the up and comming commander.<br />The book shows in great detail the rigors of life at sea. From dangerous storms, engangement with the enemy, to the boredom of life in between engagements.<br />Jack, though a brilliant seaman, tends not to play the political game very well, and proves it by having a not so private trist with the wife of the Commodore. This action leads him and his ship to not get the recognition they deserves and ultimately leads to the actions in the final battle which I will leave for you to find out when you read this exciting book.<br />I highly suggest you try these books. They are fun, well written, and exciting books that detail life at sea during the start of the 19th century.
B000002H6C|5.0|Hell id give this album 10 stars if i could. And Its true that it would've been even better if they mixed the bass in, but come on its not that big a deal, Jason got a chance to show off his skills on the later albums.<BR>This is not only my favourite metallica album but 1 of my favourite metal albums too.<BR>tracks:<br />1)Blakened:  one of metallicas best, its a really fast agressive song about pollution and ruining the environment. The chorus is great and its a great opening track. 10/10<br />2)...And Justice for All:  Well its certainly worthy of being the title track. I like it more than blakened and again its one of my all time favourite Metallica songs. from the complex acoustic parts to the heavy guitar bits this song is jam-packed with great music. 10/10<br />3) Eye of the Beholder:  Another great song. It can't compete with the 1st 2 tracks though. Another song with a great chorus. I like the line 'You can do it your own way. If its done just how I say.'   9/10<br />4) One:  A true masterpeice. yet another one of my favourites, and this songs is a big fan-favourite and people have claimed it to be the greatest song metallica ever wrote.   10/10 <br />5) Shortest Straw:  This song can get a bit repeditive at times, and is probably my least favourite on the album, but by no means does that make it a bad song. 8/10<br />6)Harvester of Sorrow: Probably my favourite song on the whole cd! its among my favourite metallica songs. I just love the main riff its probably my favourite riff Ive ever heard. Then again people might disagree. If you've heard a better riff let me know by emailing me at metal_mayhem01@hotmail.com. I'll be interested to see what people think.  11/10<br />7)Frayed Ends Of Sanity:   Another masterpeice! Metallica never cease to amaze me. It opens with the ow-ee-oh, ee-oh-wow (or however you're supposed to write it) from the wizard of oz.<BR>Its a great fast song with a great chorus and the verses are also good. 10/10<br />8)To Live is To Die:The instumental song for this album (well, almost he says a few sentences in the middle). <BR>The guitarwork is amazing! It varies soi much musically and proves that you don't need lyrics for a good song.  9/10<br />9)Dyers Eve: The first time i heard this song i was blown away. Its so damn fast! Again one of my favourite Metallica songs and a great song to end the album with. Everything about this song is great. At some bit it sounds a little like something by Slayer, but that's just my opinion.     10/10<br />wow, this album has so many of my favourite metallica songs on it! I highly recommend it to anyone who is into metal.
B000068PQ0|4.0|i bought this album yesterday having only heard about the band and only having heard one song they released way back in 93-94. i was not disappointed by any means. everything to the arrangements of the songs, the colorful pallette of tones to the lyrics screams &quot;imaginative and innovative!!&quot; i'm reminded of a much cooler version of the polyphonic spree (which i cant stand)and helio sequence (whom i love). think john lennon meets neil young meets roger waters. favorite tracks: robot symphony, ego tripping at the gates of hell. the whole thing rocks. find a quiet comfortable space where you can chill for about 45 minutes, crank up this album and just absorb it like a sponge. you'll be glad you did....p.s. i'm definitely purchasing 'the soft bulletin'
B00005A46T|4.0|Ok im gonna start off by saying that I am a big fan of the Knot. I 'm not one of those fans who think this is the greatest music they've every heard and won't listen to anyone else's opinion though. I own  both this album and their self titled debut and there's no doubt that i will buy vol.3 (the subliminal verses) as soon as it comes out. <BR>But Slipknot have their pros and their cons. The first con that comes to mind is that it is a band with 9 members. Thats right 9. It doesn't really matter that much but what I'm trying to say is go listen to Sepultura or SLayer, they are band with 4 members and they make as much noise as these guys. I dont even get why they need a drummer and 2 percussionists, I got nothing against Joey Jordison but the drumming on both albums is good, but nothing special.<BR>This is music to listen to if you've just had a really $#itty day and wanna escape from reality, real headbanging material. Its not for little tini-boppers who look up to pop stars that aren't gonna matter in a few months time.<BR>Now I like to think that i have a fairly open mind. I advise you at least give this a listen, if it's not for you then fair enough, im not telling you you have to like it. <BR>Corey's voice can be a bit much for some people but believe me he has a great voice whether it be a thundering roar vor melodic singing (see 'my plauge' 'left behind' and parts of 'the shape' for samples) If you've ever heard the song Jumpdafukup featuring Corey Taylor on the Soulfly album Primitive or even better the Stone Sour album, you can hear Corey singing beautifully.<BR>It probably sounds like I'm bagging SlipKnot but Im not really i appreciate what those guys are doing and will keep listening to their music, although i still prefer to listen to metallica or iron maiden.<BR>In conclusion (if you've read this far without falling asleep) Slipknot definately isnt for everyone, but I still love them and this album is definately worth the money.
0156027321|4.0|I am a high school student and for our world literature class we were required to read the \\"Life of Pi\\". The novel by Yann Martel is different. It is a novel about religion, zoology and a boy named Pi, who survived seven month with a tiger on a lifeboat. Pi is different. He sees life different and practices in his young age three different religions. The novel teaches a different view on life in a colorful way. It is a story about survival and like this a story about everyone's life. Dealing with all of those very different topics, the novel still gives a clear picture, close to reality and the pictures come alive while reading the book. Not only the story is very different from every other book I have ever read, but also the end closes in an unusual way. The novel ends in a contradiction and leaves questions behind after closing the last page of the book. The questions are what make the novel leave an impression that stays. What first came to my mind after closing the book is, that it taught me things I maybe would have never learned without reading the book. And I am thankful for that. I recommend you to read the novel \\"Life of Pi\\" if you are open for something new, interesting and different.
B000063DIF|5.0|Well i'll start off by saying how surprised i was when i saw there were only 5 customer reviews for this album! i like to hear different people's opinions on cds and im sure im not alone. <BR>But anyway, i would have to say that this is one of maidens best albums to date! And for so many reasons too.<BR>The highlight tracks are Moonchild, Infinate Dreams, The Evil That Men Do, the title track and The Clarivoyant.(taht's almost all the tracks anyway)<BR>I find that all maiden fans love Can i Play With Madness, but personally i find it to be a bit of a weak track, but anything by maiden is good. <BR>I think the Prophecy is an underrated song. I didnt put it in the highlight tracks but its still an outstanding track, especially the combination of the synth and guitar at the start and finish.<BR>As for Only the good Die Young, well i think it an average maiden song at most. I think its the repeditiveness of the chorus that puts people off.<BR>Now to the good songs.<br />The opening track Moonchild is great. And the way that album starts and end with the 'seven deadly sins....' thing is genius and it give the album a real theme. <br />Infinate dreams starts off soft and you get to hear the softer side of bruce's voice and then it plunger into yet anohter masterpeice.<br />For a long time i just couldn't get over the track the Evil That Men Do. It is a true classic, and sometimes underrated.<br />Now for the epic 10 minute title track. This is another amazing track. It gives you some background about the seventh son myth too, even though i still dont understand it too well, something about a clarivoyant who forsees disaster and noone believes him and i dont see where the whole seventh son thing fits in (if you know plaese email me at metal_mayhem01@hotmail.com)<br />Ahh the Clarivoyant. I especially like the chorus to this song, you can hear the agression in bruce's voice. Now that's music.<br />So in conclusion i highly reccomend this masterpiece of an album as well as most of maidens other stuff. now go out there and headbang your ass off!
B00011RPB0|3.0|Okay, the movie was slightly scattered as far as well-organized scripts go.  Additionally, the dialogue, when active, was slightly dull and anticlimactic.<br />I liked it though.  How strange is that?<br />If you want a movie that drives straight to your &quot;misunderstood aspects&quot; and those you think are never heard in today's busy society, see this flick.<br />Otherwise, maybe you should see something else.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The only maiden album ive heard or got that i like more than this one is powerslave.<BR>This album has so many good songs on it! The only real comment about it that i have is that this is the 1st maiden album ive heard where they mention tv, cars and modern things in the lyrics(even if it is only in 2 of the songs), which seems a bit weird to me and i prefer it when they sing about myths and evil etc. its a lot more interesting. <BR>heres a quick look at the tracks:<br />1)Wildest Dreams:  hmmmmm this is a bit of a weak track and doesn't really sound like a maiden song to me. its still ok though. 6/10<br />2)Rainmaker:  Ahhh thats better now we're into the good stuff. This song rules! The opening riff and chorus are catchy and overall it's a great fast song. True iron maiden. 10/10<br />3)No More Lies:  this is a true masterpeice. the riff at the start is amazing and it only gets better. The chorus is bruce screaming 'No more lies!' and it has a huge solo. 10/10<br />4)Monsegur:  Another great song. I don't like it as much as rainmaker or no more lies but hey its still a great song. I don't like it towards the end where it speeds up and the riff starts sounding more happy instead of heavy. But its still a great song.   9/10<br />5)Dance of Death: This one is another of my personal favourites. The way it stars with the acoustic riff and gradually build up is incredible. The lyrics are also good, apart from a few bits, i still shudder when i hear bruce say &quot;And i danced!And i pranced!&quot;  The rest is good though, especially the 3 guitar solos, 1 from each guitarist! 10/10<br />6)Gates of Tomorrow: A fast loud track that isn't one of my favourites, but hey anything by maiden is good. It definately has its moments though. I like it. 9/10<br />7)New Fronteir:  The 1st song drummer Nicko McBrain wrote in 20 years! Good on you Nicko. This song is awesome, especially the chorus. 10/10<br />8)Pashendale:  Easily my favourite track on the album, and one of my all timefavourite songs by iron maiden. This i suppose would be the epic track on Dance of Death, and i absolutely love it. The lyrics are amazing and so is the guitarwork. The way it starts with the soft little riff and plunges into a huge heavy masterpeice. I was reminded of the Seventh son of a seventh son album when i heard this song because of the way it starts and ends with the same soft riff. <BR>This song has everything and builds up to this huge climax that will leave you screaming for more. For me it was the highlight of the album - PASCHENDALE KICKES ASS! 11/10<br />9)Face in the Sand: Another good song (although it doesnt measure up to pashendale). About disasters and I think it's the bands thoughts on the whole september 11th incident which it great coz they're entitled to their opinion. 9/10<br />10)Age of Innocence: Starts softly and soon really kicks off. I'm not sure what it's about, but it doesnt really matter the chorus gives their message out loud and clear 'We only get 1 chance can we take it. And we only got one life can't exchange it. Can we hold on to what we have can we take it...' 9.5/10  <br />11)Journeyman: The only acoustic song iron maiden have written. Truly a classic. Yet again here's a song that gives it message out clearly: 'I know what i want, i say what i want, and noone can take it away,' 10/10<br />In conclusion, Dance of Death was a success, the only real negative thing i can say about it is its weird cover artwork, but i suppose it fits in with the title track if you listen to the lyrics. So if you are a true metalhead, or just someone who can appreciate good music, i urge you to get hold of this cd you won't regret it.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|This is a smooth music CD.  His voice is relaxing and some of his remakes to popular 80s music is very interesting.  Highly recommended ... its got a great mix of slow and fast music.  The slow music is relaxing and doesnt focus on depressive love music.  Uplifting while being relaxing.  Nice blend.
0385504209|1.0|What is amazing about this book is that it actually made its way into print and then was received as an intelligent work.  Having lived in Paris, I can vouch that the descriptions of that city bear no relation to reality.  The supposedly intelligent characters spend most of their time gasping in amazement over the obvious.  The presumed history is anything but, and even the premise of the book, lifted freely from the Rennes-le-Chateau enigma in southern France, has been deformed beyond recognition.  And lastly, the book is a rather large slur against Catholicism, painting the Church of Rome as alternately incompetent and psychopathic.  I suppose that the book would not have annoyed me so much had it not come so highly recommended, and had not the author suggested that his work was factually accurate.  I'm sorry to say it (I can't recall every giving a book one star), but at nearly every level, this book is just so much schlock.
0385504209|5.0|This book was by far the best book I've ever read. Dan Brown presents so much information in this book. Some things I thought weren't true, so I looked them up, and I must commend him because he obviously did his research. While this is a fiction book, he presents an immense amount of factual information to tie in with his story.And to the contrary of what another reviewer said...this book is anything BUT predictable. The storyline was invented in the mind of Mr. Brown and has so many twists and turns, a claim that this is &quot;predictable&quot; is entirely false. I strongly urge everyone to read this book. It is guaranteed to make you think twice about some things in the future, and make you look at things in a whole new light. You will probably find yourself looking up things online to see if they're true, and then find yourself amazed when you reveal the truth and you realize Dan Brown knows his stuff. A great book by a great author and it tops my &quot;must read&quot; list. If my review doesn't convince you...look at the bestseller list for the past weeks...you'll notice a familiar name around the top.
B000063WDH|5.0|The Black keys are a two piece outfit that not only take inspiration from Blues artists such as `R.L Burnside', `Howlin Wolf', and the rock stylisation of `Hendrix' &amp; a little bit of funk, they've created a deceptively powerful album that deserves a truly wider audience.  Dan Auerbach (guitar) is something of a revelation, coaxing huge bursts of Southern Blues Guitar groove that takes in elements of Funk, soul and more importantly Garage-rock, but undoubtedly it's mainstay is tightly woven blues that remain authentic, but by having a handle on these other genres (Funk, Soul...etc) they avoid repetition and Blues clichs, and stand out as individual artists in their own right.  If you liked the `White Stripes' (yes, I know virtually every reviewer here has mentioned them), then think of this a grittier, more authentic integration of Blues into their two piece sound, and thus maybe not as immediate accessible as the White Stripes.  If anything it's in some ways closer to \\"The John Spencer Blues Explosion's\\" more groove laden moments.  But either way this is a superbly executed album that feels way more competent than any short sighted `White Stripes' comparisons, and if you like your Blues passionate, Energetic, Fiery, Smart and above all organic, the Black Keys have delivered an album that's going to be hard to beat.
B000000HHE|4.0|4 1/2 stars really (the skits lost it the usual masterpiece's 5 star rating) and essential to Hip Hop's evolution. Of the soul.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I think that if this film was done by anyone else, other than another Coppola, that it wouldn't have received very much attention. This film is mildly entertaining.
B000002AZ8|2.0|I know everyone loves Ten, and I'm for one sick of it. However it's just a fact, Ten is their best album. That album is wickedly good. And Vitalogy, is their worst. I loved the concept and even some of the music, but because lyrics are important to me I didnt find this album to have the passion and strength displayed in Ten.<br />Trying not to compare the two I rebrought the album and gave it a chance. Corduroy, my favorite, is addictive and a magnificent song. Better man is good as well. However, outside of these, I couldn't get into the album. Especially Bugs, I hated it. Spin the Black Circle just didnt need to be on this album. I understand the band means well, but it just didnt go well. They didnt revive until Yield in my opinion.
B00013RC9I|5.0|The album is Talkie Walkie, the genre is &quot;ultra chill.&quot; I wanted an album to relax to. All the worries of the world slip away as you listen to beautiful, relaxing music. That's what this is. I put it in the playlist with Zero 7.
B0000027RL|5.0|OK, everyone knows how great Ten is. But why? The powerful lyrics, the passionate concept, the originality (at the time), the strong musicianship...it was perfect. It was a fresh and welcomed change. I, for one, am not a fan of the lyrically confused melancholic sound of most &quot;grunge&quot; albums which is why I love this one. The band rocked out without capitalizing on despair, loathing in self pity or confusion like Nirvana did. I hate to compare the two, but it's true. Pearl Jam was about progression through awareness, Nirvana was just about fame through tragedy. I prefer the first.
B000005E60|5.0|Luciano Berio was commissioned to write a work for the New York Philharmonic's 150th anniversary.  What resulted was the Sinfonia, a masterpiece of the twentieth century musical movement.  This work combines many of the Italian composers fascinations - from Mahler to Martin Luther King - and sympathizes them.  The result is fascinating, stimulating, and thoroughly enjoyable.  Boulez's interpretation is really top-notch.  He leads the orchestra with great power, gusto, and energy.  This vision is evident, especially in the third moment of the piece.  Berio here takes the Scherzo from Mahler's second symphony and &quot;pastes&quot; in other famous musical phrases from Debussy, Ravel, Beethoven, Schoenberg and others as well as adding voices, which sustain a dialog throughout the entire movement.  Boulez's intellectual approach to music is appreciated here - the result is a crisp, definitive reading of this powerful twentieth century masterpiece.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Don't expect listen another &quot;From the Cradle&quot; because this album are very distant of this new &quot;Me &amp; Mr Johnson&quot;!<BR>Something missing but I don't know what...intensity, feeling, carism, innovation...in some moments the songs stop in the time and a sensation of &quot;empty&quot; stay on the air.<BR>Whatever this album show some good moments (slow moments but good!). All musicians are playing with dedication and accuracy, inclusively Clapton that play like always (and like nobody) your registered style. Perfect for listen in a &quot;raining sunday&quot; with a fragille wind cover your face in the window! :)
B0000041WV|5.0|Kertesz was the one of the greatest conductors of Antonin Dvorak.  His traversal here with the London Symphony Orchestra remained one of the few complete cycles of the symphonies for nearly two decades.  Although some more recent cycles have been popping up (Jarvi's cycle with the Scottish National Orchestra is a prime example), this set still holds up as one of the definitive cycles of these great works.<br />Kertez was a true musical genius.  His ability to learn and absorb scores so quickly and efficiently was quite unusual, even for conductors.  This ability, coupled with his unique conducting practices, brought great color to these symphonies.  Never a fan of rehearsals, Kertez never over-rehearsed any music he recorded.  Rather, he liked to keep the players on their toes, if you will, keeping a level of spontaneity and energy rarely matched by other conductors.  Furthermore, the London Symphony was not very familiar with Dvorak (unfortunately, orchestra's are still not familiar with the earlier symphonies), and the \\"newness' of the works only ads to the spontaneous, rustic sound created by the orchestra.  And what a sound!  The brass, especially the trombones, executes their parts powerfully and majestically.  The woodwinds play with a level of sublimity rarely found in Dvorak.  The stings create a wonderful rustic sound that suites Dvorak quite well.  As a musician deeply routed in the folk tradition, this rustic quality only adds to that folk feel.  All in all, the performances are, on a whole, so good, it seems odd that the orchestra was not familiar with the works.  This is a great way to become familiar to the less popular, but by no means less delightful, early symphonies.  Although the recordings are analog and there is a bit of an audible hiss in the background, the overall sound is very good, as to be expected from London Decca.  And at a bargain price, this set just becomes more attractive.  A fantastic addition to any CD collection.
B000000LZV|5.0|&quot;Mr. Narrator/This is Bob Dylan to me/My story could be his song/I am his soldier-child.&quot;  --D. Boon<br />I sadly remember 1984, how the bands that made up the great LA punk scene began to break up or break out, often experimenting with heavy-metal or other non-punk styles.  But the Minutemen had never been punk purists, and were able to keep doing what they did very, very well.  Here's their masterpiece.  You wouldn't think there was any middle ground between hardcore and jazz, but they found it. Yet they were totally unique, if somewhat challenging.  True to the name, most of the cuts clock in at 1 to 2 minutes.  My faves: &quot;Corona&quot;, &quot;Fire in My House&quot; (from H. Rollins), &quot;Jesus and Tequila&quot;, &quot;This Ain't No Picnic&quot;, and the Michael Jackson &quot;parody&quot;.  To bad the Van Halen cover is missing (to fit the single CD).  Still, you need this album!
B000067DNC|5.0|I love every season of SG1, but season 2 was hands down the best.  The thing that makes SG1 better than all other SciFi is continuity.  The story lines are far reaching and many of the best story lines started in Season.  In fact, I am looking at the episodes of season 2 and I believe every single on is contunued or refered to in future episodes.  What an amazing series from just an OK movie.
0345457684|4.0|I'm not in the habit of reading murder mysteries. Not that there's anything wrong with them, but mystery novels aren't my cup of tea. As someone always on the lookout for a good science fiction novel, however, I found myself suckered into \\"Altered Carbon,\\" so now I can say that I've read my first high-tech, futuristic detective story.<br />\\"Altered Carbon\\" is set mostly in Bay City (formerly San Francisco) four centuries into the future. People familiar with San Francisco will probably have a little fun with some of the locations (the upscale Potrero neighborhood is now a seedy, crime-ridden dump called Licktown), and all readers will find themselves immersed in a world in the ability to \\"digitize\\" human memories and consciousness is both a blessing and a curse. The protagonist, Takeshi Kovacs, finds himself sprung from digital storage and put to work solving an increasingly labyrinthine case involving murder, suicide, and some very depraved recreational pursuits. Along the way he gets involved in a couple of VERY [erotic] situations and multiple episodes of graphic violence and torture. Fair warning to any reader who doesn't handle such things well.<br />What I found most provocative about this tale is the aforementioned ability to digitally record and store human consciousness and memories. Most people are implanted with \\"cortical stacks\\" at the base of the skull after birth, and if one is killed or grievously injured, one's very conscious being can be \\"re-sleeved\\" in a new body (natural, enhanced, or completely synthetic), provided one has the money. This raises all kinds of interesting questions about the nature of human consciousness, self-awareness, and what is often called the Soul. In this future world, self-proclaimed Catholics can forego such \\"re-sleeving,\\" since they believe that God takes possession of the Soul once the body has given it up. But this begs the question: If the cortical stack and stored memories of a Catholic are crucial in a murder investigation, whose rights take precedence?<br />The plot of \\"Altered Carbon\\" is pretty (...) complicated, and no matter how close attention readers pay to the clues, the puzzle doesn't quite come together until near the very end, and then one is sorely tempted to read the whole book over again. I found myself leafing back and forth through the book after I was finished, every so often saying to myself, \\"Oh, so THAT'S what they were talking about!\\" Still Takeshi Kovacs is a pretty intriguing character, some of the dialogue and narrative is really witty, and overall this is a pretty stunning debut novel for Richard Morgan. I've already snagged a copy of his follow-up, \\"Broken Angels,\\" again featuring Takeshi Kovacs. I can't wait to start reading it this evening.igation, whose rights take precedence?<br />The plot of \\"Altered Carbon\\" is pretty (...) complicated, and no matter how close attention readers pay to the clues, the puzzle doesn't quite come together until near the very end, and then one is sorely tempted to read the whole book over again.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|No need to repeat what the previous people have written. The one thing that I would add, and I'm amazed that there's not more mention of it, is the AMAZING and powerful rendition of \\"Wah Wah\\"! What an unbeleiveable performance with most of the featured(pop) artist participating. Almost worth the price of the disc for that track alone!
6304178352|5.0|Lerner and Loewe's musical version of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion got its first cinematic colour treatment (q.v. the 1938 version with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller) as well as eight Oscars.  Much of the story's already known--how Professor Henry Higgins, an expert in phonetics (the science of speech), takes it upon himself to transform a Cockney flower girl working in Covent Garden into a lady.  That &quot;draggletail guttersnipe,&quot; that &quot;squashed cabbage leaf,&quot; and &quot;incarnate insult to the English language&quot; is Eliza Doolittle, who is outraged and insulted by Higgins' arrogant, patronizing attitude to her, but she does dream of a better life, being able to open up a flower shop and being able to afford chocolates-hence her desire to speak more genteel.<br />Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White), a veteran soldier posted in India who studied the languages there, treats Eliza like a lady rather than a flower girl, and is by far the more gentlemanly of the men.  This point is driven home when Eliza tells Higgins that the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she's treated.  And Higgins is at times impatient, frustrated, but treats her more as an experiment than a human being.<br />A daunting task it is, as Eliza finds it difficult to turn her long i's into a's and to add her &quot;h's.&quot;  But when she finally does, it's a triumph, which leads to the back to back ebullience of &quot;The Rain in Spain&quot; and &quot;I Could Have Danced All Night,&quot; with Hepburn's singing voice done by Marni Nixon.<br />The concepts of classes division is seen in Higgins' opening number, when he wonders why the English can't teach their children how to speak.  He notes how the way one Englishman speaks makes another Englishman despise him, where the nobility look down on the working class, and the working class become fed up with the nose-in-the-air attitude of the upper classes.  A universal manner of speaking so that there will be no class conflict would be nice, but I'd sure miss that chirpy &quot;Cor blimey, gov&quot; from the docks.<br />Another is the Victorian distinction between men and women, in Higgins' &quot;Let A Woman In Your Life&quot; number.  Men had more independence than women then, and Higgins is able to do what he wants.  In marriage, the man is tying the knot all right...around his own neck.  And speaking of marriage, it's clearly a bourgeois concept.  Once a man has enough money and standing, he has certain social responsibilities.  This is demonstrated in Eliza's father Alfred Doolittle, a working class dustman who hasn't married her stepmother.  Stan Holloway reprised his role as Alfred from the stage version.<br />Audrey Hepburn's talents really come forth via her brash and loud Cockney accent, and for this she worked with phonetics professor Peter Ladefoged at USC in LA.  She is effervescent throughout, whatever costume she wears;  and as for that smile, it's magical.  And for Rex Harrison to have worked opposite Julie Andrews in a film version would've yielded a carbon copy of the stage version.  Working with Hepburn, his performance was more challenging and spirited, and hence his Best Actor Oscar.<br />Indeed, it won eight Oscars, including three of the big four-actor (Rex Harrison), director (George Cukor) and picture.  Unfortunately, its loss to Best Actress was the most conspicuous, as Audrey Hepburn ironically lost to Julie Andrews, the stage version of Eliza.  And Cecil Beaton's costume designs was another deserved win, not only for Eliza's white Ascot dress and hat, but for the ballroom scene as well.<br />This is one of Hepburn's best vehicles, along with Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Charade, How To Steal A Million, and Wait Until Dark.king so that there will be no class conflict would be nice, but I'd sure miss that chirpy &quot;Cor blimey, gov&quot; from the docks.<br />Another is the Victorian distinction between men and women, in Higgins' &quot;Let A Woman In Your Life&quot; number.

B000007S5B|4.0|I own this album on vinyl and really enjoy it. The songs Love Street and Summer's Almost Gone are reason enough to own it in my opinion. That's not even counting the classics Unknown Soldier and Spanish Caraqvan, along with Five to One. The studio version of Not to Touch the Earth, however, pales in comparison to the live version found on the Doors album Absolutely Live.
B00004STOZ|2.0|... is how Sir Thomas Beecham described harpsichord music, and I have to agree (he actually said it sounded like the skeletons were copulating on a tin roof in a thunderstorm). <br />On this recording, the playing, while accurate, is often slow and ponderous, and while the harpsichord sound is clear and the playing even, it jangles the nerves after a short while, and of course the harpsichord is inherently unable to bring out the inner voices of the many beautiful canons, dances, toccatas, and fugues in this monumental work.<br />I much prefer a bright Steinway sound, in competent hands, which brings out all the color and texture, without scrambling the brain!
0393312836|5.0|This book is amazing. It is a great, fast paced story of the future that also has a strong moral message. Burgess opens it by introducing us to Alex. A teenager bent on destruction and violence. He's not the only one though, nearly every teenager is like him. At one point though he gets caught in one of his acts of violence and he has to go to prison. He then gets a miracle cure that makes him absolutely sick of even the thought of harming anyone and is thrown out into the world leaving him open to the revenge of all the people he harmed before.<br />This book alone would be a good story. Burgess doesn't just tell a good story though. Every action has a meaning and a purpose in the book it is not just 'filler paper'.A good show of how teenagers have an affinity towards violence. But Burgess doesn't stop there. Burgess writes on how people can change. He brings up the problem of choice. Is the man who is forced to good more moral than the man who chooses to do bad? Moral choice is what seperates man from beast isn't it? It is very thought provoking and I am very happy that I stumbled upon this book.
B0001ENYKS|4.0|Ok, I will state it simply:  This is a very good cd.  Anyone with ADD can stop reading now.<br />For everyone else, let's go a little deeper.  No, I don't consider these guys some sort of rock saviors, and in fact their sound is really nothing new, but as with the Srokes and the White Stripes, this is a good thing.  Apparently a lot of reviewers are hearing something here that I am not... I don't understand comparisons with this band and Interpol or the Rapture... Interpol is very much a Joy Division-esque band, and The Rapture are somewhat similar.  I hear Joy Division in Longwave, but not here.  Ditto for the Cure... I hear the Cure in The Stills (New Order as well, while we're talking about it), but not here.  <br />That said, Franz Ferdinand sounds, to me, a lot like the Strokes... but more, I don't know, melodic?  The music seems less structured, but as musicians these guys may be more talented... there are some fantastic riffs on this cd, and some great tempo changes. Its a cd that can make you move involuntarily (listen to Take Me Out... those guitars will stick with you all day). The vocals are superior to the Strokes, I think that is one reason people are put off by that reference - there is some harmonizing here, the lyrics often actually make sense, and aren't nearly as distorted, and thats part of the Strokes trademark.  If you've heard The Libertines Up the Bracket, this is the sound I think they were trying to emulate (and failed, for the most part).  Maybe like the Clash, but... less edge?<br />Lets just agree that no matter who you hear in their sound, the bands anyone has named are some of the greats, either in recent years (Strokes, Interpol) or of the 70s and 80s (the Cure, Joy Division, etc).  If you like any of those bands, pick up the cd.  I agree with whoever said they're not sure they can &quot;get lost&quot; in this cd... its very good, but I'm not sure its a &quot;classic&quot;... hence four stars.  But this year has been pretty sparse thusfar, so I would strongly recommend this cd.  After all, this is just their debut.....
B000002H6C|5.0|this is the first album metallica recorded with a new bass player named jason newsted.everything about this album is EXCELLENT!! guitars are brutal,james really knows how to growl,and the drums has the best work on the entire album,lars absoulutly knows how to pummel his drums on every song,jasons bass lines cannot be heard which sucks.i know if cliff burton was still alive and was in this album this wouldve been better than master of puppets.this is metallicas last great album,i would highly recommend it to any thrash fan.
B00005JMNA|5.0|I am so glad that our (latino/latina) opinion is moving on and it is becoming an important part of the mainstream when reviewing items like this fantastic film. This film, based on a true story, is an inspiration and motivation for latino audiences and artists. It created some role models and the possibility to say: \\"si se puede\\" (Yes, it is possible.) Who would it thought that Diego Luna was going to be one of the stars in this picture? The production and dancing was great. The adaptation to pop-modern latin culture was also important because it opens a window for the new generations. These film put the past and the future together in one scenario. Please open your minds and hearts to the good old/new latino music and culture.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I ordered the Firefly series at the behest of a friend, never having watched it on TV. I admit I wasn't too sure about the whole western/sci-fi thing.<br />So, we pop the first CD in, start up the first episode, and 10 minutes later....WE WERE HOOKED. This series is probably some of the best work I've ever seen and I've watched a lot over my years. The dry humor, the characters, the storylines-fantastic. We were SO disappointed when the last CD finished-we wanted more! We watched the entire series this weekend, front to back. <br />Afterwards, I was trying to figure out why the heck the show had been canceled. My guess is FOX is afraid of quality television? I'd hate to think that.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|Finally, TUSK the way it was meant to be presented on CD.<br />FULL version of Sara - not the single version like on the previous CD version.<br />Also of note is the Sara outtake at around 9 minutes long!<br />Great outtakes indeed.  Neat to hear Lindsey's demos.<br />My favorite Fleetwood Mac album gets the royal treatment.<br />A++
B00011RPB0|3.0|The movie is entertaining enough for an evening's viewing, although it certainly doesn't do any justice to the Park Hyatt Tokyo which is much better up close than via Sofia Coppola's cameras. As a Tokyo resident, I thought some of the Tokyo scenes were too stereotyped. However, the best parts were the encounters of Bill Murray with the Japanese, including the hotel staff, the tv host and the production crew staff for the commercials. These were kind of exaggerated, but they nevertheless had our whole group in stitches. Some people may find the dialogue and pace slow, but in a way this is Japan for you - not in-your-face all the time and full of subtle and quiet changes that slowly creep up behind you.<br />I recently read a novel called Tokyo Stories ([...]) which is about the life of foreigners in Japan, and much of it was also set in the Park Hyatt Tokyo. It was an interesting complement to see Tokyo from two sets of foreign eyes, and to see this amazing hotel against two very different backdrops. The subject matter is similar but the movie is subtle and proceeds at a leisurely pace while the book is fast-paced and direct. What a nice contrast!
B00009RAJI|5.0|This is as good as it gets as far as remasters go.  Like another reviewer noted, now they have to do &quot;Then Play On&quot;.<br />The outtakes are a very interesting listen as well.<br />Also I noticed that on the official version of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; in fades up at the beginning like on the Very Best of FM album.  I wonder why this is.  I seem to remember it just starting rather than fading up.<br />Oh well, still a great remaster!<br />A++
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Our youngest daughter loaned us the Firefly DVDs.  My wife and I were amazed, delighted, and captivated by the fantastic episodes we viewed.  The theme song was great and keeps replaying in our minds.  The mix of western with science fiction was just the right combination.  The use of Chinese phrases now and then allowed the characters to appear to curse while keeping the action clean.  The magnetism between the characters leaves you wanting more!
B00005JMSE|4.0|When I first heard about this movie, I was not impressed.  But its opening seemed to generate some buzz, so I talked my 2 sons out of seeing Scooby Doo 2, and seeing this film instead.  They seemed to enjoy it, and I was happy that the language was not littered with inappropriate words, sexual innuendo, and vulgar displays like so many other PG-13 films.  If you are going to bring kids, be forwarned that some of the characters die in the movie, so it is not for the overly sensitive.<br />It had good characters, plot, and effects.  The movie was entertaining from start to finish.<br />The reason that I did not give it 5 stars was the bad guys (humans and monsters) were a bit one dimensional. The hell hound was cool at first, but by the end of the movie it gets to be tiresome.  The final climax was anticlimatical and cliche as well.  MiB was a bit better.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Oh yes, to all those who whine that the reason it's unappreciated is because it's above our understanding - we &quot;got it&quot;.  Two lonely hearts, beat as one, and then are torn from each other forever.  Who cares?  This was the most depressing waste of time I've spent in front of a TV.  I am just so grateful I rented it and yet still regretful that I wasted $3. What was the story?  Infidelity, loneliness (which we are to understand excuses the infidelity), two people without meaning or hope trying to hold a decent conversation but failing miserably - all with unexplainable nudity, smoking addictions and - for kicks and maybe a few laughs - let's have it all happen in Japan.<br />Haven't we seen this same plot unfold down the street, across town, for some in their own homes?  Because life seems empty it is suddenly OK to cheat on your spouses, carouse like you are 17, smile smugly as if you are above all around you and in the end become more lonelier and empty than before?<br />Oh yes - we got it.  For all those who claim we have misunderstood this movie and therefore don't appreciate it - no.  We just don't like it.  To the jaded, empty, bitter and jilted: enjoy.  The rest of us will keep an eye out for a movie of substance.
0195067142|5.0|&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; chronicles Dr. Sledge's life as a Marine in the Pacific Theater of World War II.  The book is divided into two sections describing the campaigns that Sledge took part in: Peleliu and Okinawa.<br />Sledge's writing style is straightforward and his descriptions are vivid.  The thing that impressed me most was his ability to convey the mindset of himself and his fellow soldiers throughout the war.  The progression of fear, horror, confusion, disgust, and resolve are all described in a way that you will understand exactly what he felt.<br />Sledge gives just enough coverage of the high-level progression of the campaigns to give the reader context for the story he is telling.  At first I wished for a more complete description, but I came to realize that this information was rarely available to the soldiers at the time.  To include it would detract from his objective:  to show what war is to a front-line soldier.  \\"With the Old Breed\\" accomplishes that objective better than anything else that I have read.<br />As an aside:  I would recommend skipping the Introduction.  I felt that it revealed several key events out of context, and thus lessened their effect when I reached them in the book.

0694003611|5.0|This was one of my children's favorite books.  I started reading it to them when they were 3 or 4 months old.  They absolutely loved this book, even when they were older.  One of their fondest memories is of my reading this book to them.  I am now reading it to my granddaughters and they are also enthalled by the book.  You can't go wrong purchasing this one!!!!!

B000024D4R|5.0|'Pigs on the Wing' 1 + 2 are two short stripped-down acoustic numbers by Roger Waters.  They are two of the most beautiful pieces of work I have ever heard played on an acoustic guitar.  Roger Waters' limited range lends itself perfectly to these tracks.  &quot;If you didn't care...what happened to me&quot; Waters struggles with the last syllable but the effect is beautiful - you can hear the hurt in his voice...And then at the end of the second song we get a glimpse of the wonderfully absurd: &quot;And shelter...from pigs on the wing.&quot;<br />'Dogs' is one of the all time most underrated tracks of Floyd's canon.  The song is divided into a few different sections, running alltogether at 17 minutes but never feeling long.  Gilmour sings the beginning part beautifully (also beautifully imitated by Jon Carin on Roger Waters: In the Flesh I might add) and then Waters comes in near the end to add his vocals.  Gilmour's guitar work on this song is some of the most striking work I have ever heard...Simply an incredible song, and a highlight of this incredible album...<br />'Pigs (Three Different Ones)' is reminiscent of 'Dogs' in my opinion, even if I usually prefer 'Dogs.'  Still, 'Pigs' has a great melody and lyrics by Roger.  &quot;Hey you, white house, ha ha, charade you are!&quot;  Roger sings with a lot of gusto here.  A fine piece of work.<br />'Sheep' is the only song on here I don't love, buts not bad at all...It does rock, for sure, but it doesn't strike a chord in me like the rest of the tracks do...Of course, it was chosen to be on 'Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd' so what do I know?<br />A fabulous album.  Recommended to all fans of Pink Floyd.
B000051YEG|5.0|Franchement, c'est un des meilleurs disques dans ma collection.  Achetez-le.  Si j'ai du choisir une bande son pour ma vie, c'est ce disque l que je choisirais.
B00000JG41|5.0|I can give no higher praise for this album than to indicate it is currently my all-time favorite album.  Why?, you ask - because it's brilliant, and is thus far the pinnacle of Mr. Bungle's extraordinary career.  Just as this is a classic album waiting for the masses to appreciate it, so is Mike Patton a living legend.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons were hugely successful in America, where they had a long string of major hits, especially in the sixties. They were less successful in Britain but still managed seven top ten hits including a number one. Here you can find all the classics. From the sixties, there are Sherry, Big girls don't cry, Walk like a man, Rag doll, Let's hang on and many others. From the seventies, there are My eyes adored you, Who loves you, December '63 Oh what a night (their only British number one hit) and Grease. Two obvious omissions from the seventies are Night (a track recorded for Motown) and Silver star ( a UK top three hit), but you can't include everything by such a successful group.<br />Aside from their own hits, covers of their songs were also successful for others. Four of their songs were UK number one hits for others. Their versions of Silence is golden (Tremeloes) and The sun ain't gonna shine anymore (Walker brothers) are not included, but you do get their original versions of Bye bye baby (Bay city rollers) and Working my way back to you (Detroit Spinners).<br />This is an excellent single CD collection of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, one of the best American groups of the sixties and seventies.
B0001I55OC|2.0|I saw Timeline because a friend of mine read the book, and said it was great. The film has an unoriginal yet promising premise,about a group of scientists who go back in time to save there professor back in the dark ages. The lead actor is played by the hugely miscast Paul Walker. Paul is the same lunkhead from the Fast and the Furious films, and is just as awful in this film as in those. His love interest is played by the awful Francis O'Conner. The chemistry is pretty bad between these two. The film has some very exciting battle scenes as the students try to save their professor and escape back to present time. The films saving grace is Gerard Butler who plays Walkers best friend. You can actually tell this guy is a trained actor and does his best with the weak script that was handed to him. If our friends at Paramount had focused a little more on casting quality actors other than hiring a bunch of  pretty faces, this might have been a better film. I admit I was entertained by this film, so it did succeed in some ways, but dont expect much.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|By far the worst movie I have seen in years.

B000002UB3|5.0|Since there has already been 700 some reviews on this album already, I'm going to approach this review on how it affected me, and not how I think it will affect YOU!<br />I first want to say that Abbey Road is my all-time favorite album ever. It is the album that influenced me to be a musician and a songwriter, and whenever I'm in a rut (musically) I always refer back to this album for inspiration.<br />My earliest memory of this album was the day my dad bought it. My dad has always been a Beatle fan, and when CD's became the norm in the very early 90's, we finally caved in and bought one. Abbey road was the first CD that we had purchased. My dad listened to it constantly. When we'd be working outside, in the house, fixing this and that... Abbey road was the album that we'd listen to. Being a kid, I loved the playfulness that it had, the harmonies, and the easily singable lyrics and harmonies.<br />As I grew older and learned to play instruments, I started to listen to it in greater detail (musically). I studied the way the music sounded against the lyrics.. and I studied the harmonies to the lyrics, and the lyrics to the music etc... I noticed how every single part in each track just 'fit'. This was the first album (and still is to me) that made complete sense. There was no nonsense on it.<br />Listening to it now, I believe that what sets this album apart from all others is the production of each track. Every instrument and chord is just right but not predictable, which is what always set the beatles apart from EVERYONE else, but the tones that George Martin was able to capture on tape is absolutely immaculate. It has a very melodic/dark sound to each track.<br />Now as a professional session/performing musician on my own and with established artists, I can honestly say that 'Abbey Road' is my 'musical bible'. This is the product that I will always be chasing after, though I will never be able to achieve (no one will in my opinion). I may get close, but Abbey Road is in a world all itself.<br />Well, thats a very short editorial of what Abbey Road is to/for me. And for what it's worth, I've enjoyed every second of it. Thank you &quot;Abbey Road&quot; For teaching me about music and showing me that the love you make is equal to the love you take!<br />All The Best, -AndyMan-oad is in a world all itself.<br />Well, thats a very short editorial of what Abbey Road is to/for me. And for what it's worth, I've enjoyed every second of it. Thank you &quot;Abbey Road&quot; For teaching me about music and showing me that the love you make is equal to the love you take!<br />All The Best, -AndyMan-
B00007ELEL|5.0|WARNING: if rolling on the floor with laughter and being sick to your stomach from laughing so hard is a problem for you, go away.  If you're a normal person, you'll love this.  So what if there is no story?  This would normally be a huge problem for me, but I was laughing to hard to care.  John Goodman stars in his best role ever.
B000003TA4|1.0|My daughter stole this the other day from her mother in a group home in order to impress her boyfriend. But he was already in jail.<BR>It sounds like somebody breaking something, with somebody else yelling about it.<BR>Or a trucker jaking in a tunnel with a state trooper rear ending him.<BR>Or monkeys screaming on monkey island as they watch zoo visitors eaten by escaped bears.<BR>Someone told my daughter it's actually pretty good if you play it backwards. But for that, you need vinyl. Is it on vinyl?
B00005JLEU|5.0|Wow.  The second you see the first spirit, your eyes will fall out of their sockets and won't go back in until the credits stop rolling.  This imaginative world full of amazing characters is the most beautiful, unique thing I have ever seen.  To top it all off, the story will touch your heart, even if it seems a little corny at times.  A must see.
B000067CQK|5.0|This 30th anniversary remaster sounds as crisp and relevant as if recorded last year.  An essential &quot;must have&quot; for Bowie fans.  Moonage Daydream doesn't get too much airplay, even on the classic rock stations, but is one of his best!
B00005JLSE|5.0|My parents dragged me with them to see this in the theater, and I was blown away.  The catchy tunes and great dance steps won't soon be forgotten.
B00005JLFC|5.0|Streisand's directorial debut is easily her most passionate and personal film to date.  It was hailed by Steven Spielberg as the \\"best directorial debut since CITIZEN KANE,\\" and I am in complete agreement.  Streisand worked for more than 15 years on bringing this film to the big screen, and it was well worth the effort.  YENTL is an absolute triumph   Every single aspect of the film works flawlessly:  the story is clever, the dialogue is extremely well-written, the cinematography is beautiful, and the performances are first-rate.      Many critics and fans found Streisand's performances in A STAR IS BORN and THE MAIN EVENT to be labored and overly-mannered.  However, there is little doubt that she once again emerges as a true actress in YENTL.  As a matter of fact, Streisand's pitch-perfect portrayal of Yentl/Anshel is quite possibly the best performance of her legendary career - I simply cannot think of any way her performance could be bettered.  Broadway tenor Mandy Patinkin is terrific as the object of Yentl's affections; it a role which should have made him a huge screen star.  The character of Haddass could have easily turned into a thankless role, however Amy Irving brings a layered depth to the part that many other young actresses could have glossed over.      YENTL is also showcase for the wonderful music of Michael Legrand (with outstanding lyrics by Marilyn and Alan Bergman), and the film uses these songs to brilliant effect.  There are no production numbers, nor singing out in the street.  Except for the finale, Streisand only sings when she is completely alone or silently as a voice-over.  The songs take the place of spoken soliloquies and represent Yentl's private thoughts.  This device has a great Shakespearean feel to it and (along with Streisand's ever passionate singing) help cement the film into the realm of fantasy.  Though YENTL was imfamously snubbed by the Academy Awards, justice was served when Streisand was awarded with the Golden Globes forBest Picture and Best Director, the first female to ever win the latter honor.
B000067J1H|5.0|Wow.  This shockingly honest, brutal movie will suck you in until it finishes.  It tells the truth about the meaningless existence of the average person, and the end will hit you harder than if you were a member of the club.  Not only that, but it is hilarious, too.  Yup, wow pretty much explains it.
B00005O3VD|5.0|The ultimate showcase for an actress, Barbra Streisand's highly publicized film debut in FUNNY GIRL met every single expectation and then some.  The film was the highest-grossing film of 1968, and it's very easy to see why.  The film has many great qualities:  It's expertly directed by three-time Academy Award winner William Wyler (the finale of the \\"Don't Rain On My Parade\\" number is just as astonishing as the chariot race in Wyler's BEN HUR), the storyline is extremely compelling, Omar Sharif is an incredibly suave and charismatic leading man, the supporting players are perfectly cast (particularly Kay Medford, Lee Allen, and Walter Pidgeon), and the song score (primarily by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill) is first-rate.  <br />However, virtually everything that FUNNY GIRL has working for it would be worthless without Barbra Streisand's absolutely phenomenal performance.  I honestly cannot think of enough good descriptive adjectives to do justice to her amazing performance in this film.  She handles drama, comedy, music numbers, and tearjerking sentiment with equal aplomb, and she does it all better than any actress before or since.  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had no choice but to honor her with the Oscar for Best Actress (in an extremely rare tie with academy favorite Katherine Hepburn; only the second tie in Oscar history to date), it is a performance that is nothing less than perfect.<br />About the DVD:  Columbia-Tristar has done an excellent job in bringing FUNNY GIRL to DVD.  The restoration of the original source elements may have taken nearly three years to complete, but it was time well spent - the picture quality is gorgeous!  Sure, there are a few nicks on the print, but the color, sharpness, and virtually everything else is nearly flawless.  Quite possibly one of the best vintage transfers yet.  The sound is also excellent, and while there are no new features included (only vintage featurettes - I expect we'll see a special edition re-issue in the future) the menu design is fantastic.
B00005JM02|5.0|Dory is reason nough to see this film.  It is a hilarious family film that you will be watching every weekend for the next two years.
B00009Y3R6|5.0|To describe this movie in a word, I would call it &quot;heartwrenching&quot;. Why would the Australian government think that the Aborigines couldn't take care of themselves? What a sad movie. I have heard about the movie earlier, and when I finally got to see the movie, as a mother, it hurt me. But what a great scene in the end. To have met the actual young girls who went through it. Great movie
0743454529|4.0|This was my first book of Jodi Picoult's long history of novels. I read it in one day because I was inthralled. The writing is not fantastic, in fact, it is somewhat mediocre, but I was not reading because of her style. I was reading because I was fascinated with her characters. I related to her dysfunctional family and felt as if I were one of the struggling family members. This is a captivating read because Ms. Picoult is able to weave the reader into the story so that she experiences the pain along with the joy of the family members.
B000062YAZ|4.0|This cd is not the best Slayer cd in my opinion but dont get me wrong it is truly a classic. 28 minutes of a brutal metal assault delievered by none other than the best in metal. Songs like Raining blood and Criminally Insane are the best on this Cd. Raining Blood is the Slayer trademark. It defines what Slayer fans know as the best in metal. The begining of this song into the opening riffs makes you want to yell SLAYER. This cd falls in with Slayer's best like Seasons and South of Heaven. The reason for the four stars is it ranks 3rd amongst the 3. If you like true heavy metal done by the best then buy this cd. Some think this was the standard Slayer set for everybody else. I dont agree fully but it comes close.
0385334206|5.0|well I must say that Mr Vonnegut, really out did himself with this book. It was a very awesome book. As always he has a way to bring you into his mind and into the story. I began to wonder if he was a character in the story as well, maybe Dwayne or Trout. <BR> I never read a book where the writer confronts  the main character in the book Kilgore Trout as he is writing it. It made me laugh really, if Trout was indeed Mr Vonnegut looking though a leak(mirror);lost in an endless pursuit or quest on the meaning of life. He puts alot of himself into the novel. A wonderful story and very funny, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did..
B0000VAFO0|4.0|This was one of the best vampire movies i have see in a while. Other than the fact that Kate Beckinsale looks really good in this it was a well put together film. It has great special effects and alot of action. You wont get bored watching this. It has the dark and gloomy atmosphere  that a movie should have. There was no unnecsary love scenes that made it boring and drug out. It is not a film of vampire seduction and sex. Great movie for vampire fans.
0553260111|5.0|What if someone suddenly woke up, was fully grown and developed, was ravaged by bullet wounds, and had no memory of the past. Jason Bourne in The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum experiences this. In his world he is born an adult and discovers quickly that he has very disturbing talents such as brutal self-defense skills, harsh interrogative capabilities, and  an extensive knowledge of weaponry. This book offers a very intriguing and fruitful plot. I enjoyed reading The Bourne Identity because Robert Ludlum goes into depth about the modus operandi of all of the antagonists, protagonists, and governmental intelligence agencies. In this book Robert Ludlum has a tendency to elaborate too much about situations at times. Sometimes this would cause me to lose interest and focus. Other than that I felt that The Bourne Identity was very enjoyable to read.<BR> In The Bourne Identity the suspense never ceases to exist. The main characters are always running, scheming, or fighting for their lives. Someone seeking to read an action packed, adventure novel will most likely enjoy this book. Also, someone who enjoys learning about psychology and how the brain works will enjoy this book very much. In this book, one will understand how someone could react in certain situations after having experienced extreme amnesia. Throughout this book Jason Bourne hears certain things or sees certain things that for some reason make him see horrific images. A psychiatrist or psychology teacher would most definitely love this book. Someone wanting a more mellow or laid back book would not enjoy this book because every moment is intense, gripping, and at any given instant something crazy can spontaneously occur. Again, I would recommend The Bourne Identity to anyone seeking an intense adventure.
B00008H2LB|5.0|While blown away by Hybrid Theory, I must say I am even more blown away by this album. No matter how hard I try to listen to something else this album always end up in my CD player. After the disappointing release of Reanimation I must say this is nothing near that. Linkin Park waited just the right amount of time to release their new album that sounds just as if tracks were added to Hybrid Theory. The album starts out great and the songs flow into each other.<br />.::Forword::. - As it's only about 13 seconds it's still a great way to start off the album. If you didn't know there was an intro you'd probably think this was the beginning of Don't Stay.<br />.::Don't Stay::. - By far one of the best songs on the album, you'll be listening to this one over and over again. Listening to this song brings back the memories of first putting in Hybrid theory. 5/5<br />.::Somewhere I Belong::. - On the radio alot, this is one most people know about. Alot like In The End, this song doesn't pick up as much as alot of the others but it's still one to listen to. 4/5<br />.::Lying From You::. - This song made me think a little bit, but I don't listen to it as much as I do the others. This song is great though. 4/5<br />.::Hit The Floor::. - This song is one of my favorite. I like the rap and then all of a sudden Chester starts screaming. If you're a fan of these songs this one will be one of your favorites fast. 5/5<br />.::Easier To Run::. - If you like Runaway in Hybrid Theory then you'll like this song. I liked Runaway and so I really enjoyed this song. I listen to this when I want I nice soft song to listen to. 5/5<br />.::Faint::. - Really seems like one of Britney Spears songs the first 5 seconds but then you know it's Linkin Park right away. Not one of my personal favorites but still a good song. 4/5<br />.::Figure.09::. - I really enjoy this song. This is one that I'll listen to alot for a long time. It's catchy and gets stuck in your head very fast. 5/5<br />.::Breaking The Habit::. - Since Mike took about 5 or 6 years to make this it's got to be good. It is. It makes you think and gets stuck in your head. Another one of my favorites. 5/5<br />.::From The Inside::. - Another one of the quieter songs but it's still good. Not one of my favorites but I still listen to it frequently. 4/5<br />.::Nobody's Listening::. - The beginning and ending lines are from High Voltage, I noticed, which isn't one of my favorite songs, but it's still good. It's the first song I really started listening to because it's one people can maybe connect to? 5/5<br />.::Session::. - All I have to say is: Meteora's Cure For The Itch, basicly. No lyrics though. 5/5 (The rating is because of how great it is when you listen to it in head phones.)<br />.::Numb::. - The final song on the album. This just leaves you wanting more. This song is great and is their new single. Very Catchy. 5/5<br />Overall, this album is wonderfull. It's one of the best albums ever made IMHO. I highly recommend it.
0385721234|5.0|Esta obra es preciosa... Tiene una historia tan tierna, y romantica a la vez, que te cautiva desde el primer momento que empiezas a leerlo. Es facil de leer, interesante, y entretenido. Se lo recomiendo a todo aquel que quiera disfrutar de una historia de amor, llena de sorpresas y pasion...
B00012QM8G|5.0|Frankly, I'm just ordering the DVD now, but I wanted to add one thing to all these reviews.  This is the ONLY movie I ever saw in a theatre where no one -- and I mean no one -- got up out of their seats for over three hours!  This is an absolutely spellbounding film, one of the best ever made!  I can't wait to add this DVD to my collection.
B000060P79|1.0|Please. I bet these guys listened to H2O nonstop and made a band just totally ripping 'em. If you want to hear a good non-sellout band that does music like Simple Plan, that started before there ever was a Simple Plan and everyone copied them, find yourself an H2O album.
B000001ELP|4.0|I've never understood why this CD gets put down so much(especially by the BAND!).  It's a good CD with confusing lyrics.  I don't try to figure out the story.  If you listen to certain lines or verses, it can be a normal Kiss CD(more or less). Am I the only one who thinks the solo on \\"Dark Light\\" is one of the coolest solos Ace has ever done?  I really like this CD.  I've owned it in one form or another since it came out in November 1981. \\"A World Without Heroes\\" is one of their best songs, lyrically.  The instrumental \\"Escape from the Island\\" is pretty rockin' for a 'concept' album.  Occasionally a lyric grabs you like \\"Under The Rose\\" ('the more you hurt/the less you feel the pain/and the more you change/the more you stay the same').  It's a far cry from \\"Makin' Love\\", \\"Love Gun\\" etc.  Give it a chance.  Yes it's a little out there, but just pretend it's a tribute album to Pink Floyd. ha ha.  Kiss are one of the few bands, in my opinion, who are incapable of making a bad album...even ones that others consider their worst
0812550706|5.0|this is the greatest book of all time. I'm not really into science fiction, but this book took my breath away! it is science fiction, but it isn't just shoot em up, it has feeling.I would definetally read this, Even if you don't like the review, you have to give this book a chance, it will suck you right in!
B00005U2LM|4.0|Wu-Tang left me a little disappointed on this album because it wasn't as good as some of their other material and on top of that it was too short.  Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this album but its just going downhill compared to there other albums.  Some good songs on the album are RULES, CHROME WHEELS, UZI, ONE OF THESE DAYS, Y'ALL BEEN WARNED.  All the members of the Wu show up lyrically on this album.  There are just a couple of week spots on here but definetely worth your money if you are a Wu-Tang Fan.<BR>          <BR> Song ratings (1-5)<br />1-  3.5<BR>2-  5<BR>3-  4<BR>4-  2 (beat sucks)<BR>5-  5 (lead off single<BR>6-  4<BR>7-  4<BR>8-  3.5 (good lyrics)<BR>9-  3<BR>10- 4<BR>11- 4<BR>12- 4
B00005JN1L|5.0|This is a good movie. You will love the move plus it is PG-13. At first you won't understand it but you can get it. I can't wait to this movie  come on DVD I will be the first to buy it. I am even going to read the book. If the book is as good as as the movie I will read the whole book in 2 days.
B000002WPI|5.0|This is no doubt a must have for any real rap fan!  And if you don't have this album you cannot call yourself a real Wu-Tang fan.  The production on this album is great, the rapping on this album is great, the lyrics on this album are great.  Their is absolutely nothing wrong with this album.  With hits like METHOD MAN, Protect Ya Neck, and C.R.E.A.M. you cant go wrong.  Everyone needs this Wu album, and if you dont have if you dont have a real cd collection.  Every song on this album is at least 4.5 stars.
0156027321|5.0|Dear Reader, please permit me this brief comment. It is not often a character from a novel has the opportunity to address the general readership. The reason you should read this book is not because of its insights into the nature of animal behavior, the survival instinct, religion, storytelling and faith, but because it beautifully demonstrates our creaturely kinship. Shortly after the shipwreck, Pi notices I am snorting in a friendly way towards him, making &quot;prusten&quot; sounds. How could I harm the boy who saved my life? Further, I had no choice when we made landfall than to flee because the rules of our engagement immediately changed once the trial was over. Tigers have impeccable manners, and on that occasion discretion and a quick departure were in order. My gratitude to Pi (and Yann) is enormous. I am hoping, in my next incarnation, to be a Hindu zookeeper located far inland. But that will be another story . . . .
0451167716|5.0|I saw the movies before I read the book and this made me even more anxious to read it and see what was different and if any of Part II was included in the book.  I'm not really big on reading so it takes a lot to keep me interested.  And Puzo did just that.  I read this book in about 4 days.  You would think that it would be hard for me to read since I already knew what was gonna happen.   But that just shows what a great job Puzo did in writing this book.   If you like to read or just like things involving the Mafia or organized crime then this is a must have for you.  Great book, best one I have ever read!  This makes me want to read every other Mario Puzo book and thats what Im gonna do!
B000002HIK|5.0|This album came right before RDJ became famous (though &quot;fame&quot; may seem like an oxymoron when describing the still-niche electronica genre, a level of fame which might make Britney Spears scoff seemed to have a profound impact on the outlook of this bedroom knob twiddler). So forget the incessant images of a grinning/leering Richard, and Chris Cunningham's perversely brilliant videos. Though Richards face does appear on the cover, ironically I think at this point it was as much a bid for celebrity as a comment on it; I remember when the album came out I thought &quot;Ugh, what an ugly portrait, who is this guy?&quot; Now everyone knows. I wonder if Richard has ever received any award for self-promotion - aspiring musicians should follow his inspired example. Squarepusher, ever the slow learning idiot-savant, just seems to have caught on fifteen years later with Ultravisitor, featuring his emotionless mug.<br />Anyway, moments of &quot;f**k with the listener's head&quot; music do appear here, eg. on the track Ventolin, but at this point they were the exception rather than the rule. What you get is a continuation of the subliminal vibe present on both Selected Ambient Works albums, only with harsher beats(I think Autechre took many of the harsh beat/fragile melody innovations on display here, and ran with them in their own direction.) When I say subliminal, I mean it; another reviewer here said it was &quot;mind control music&quot; and he has a point. If I were a psychologist studying music (or perhaps Boards of Canada, who seem fascinated with discovering the mathematical underpinnings of great music), I would dissect this album to try and figure out how the simplest of tones, and the simplest of contrast in melody and rhythm, evoke such vivid mental images and strange feelings. Incidentally, Richard said he used to have the ability to lucid dream, and that all of his pre-Drukqs music sounded &quot;yellow&quot; to him. I'm somewhat dubious of his synesthesiaclaims given his penchant for self-promotion, but I bet there's something to this. It's funny how you can tell if something is made for the artists' enjoyment, or to satisty/annoy his fans (this sort of evaluation has little to do with artistic merit - there have been many pop albums with clear target demographics that were nonetheless brilliant.) To my ear, I Care Because You Do is one of the best examples of the former type of album; it sounds like Richard made it for himself, though you can see him toying with the idea of celebrity in the cover art and playful song titles, many of which are near anagrams of &quot;Aphex Twin.&quot; <br />Back to the music. Well, it's hard to classify. I will say that this album has a &quot;cowboy western&quot; motif not present in RDJ's other work. Really. Listen to Wax the Nip, Wet Tip Hen Ax, and Mookid and I swear there is a whistling sort of melody that brings to mind Ennio Morricone and Clint Eastwood squinting at the sun. As others have said, there's also a serious &quot;classical&quot; vibe to the melodies, that caught Philip Glass' attention among others. If you've listened to Drukqs and find the idea of Aphex Twin aspiring to Erik Satie legitimacy sort of sad, don't fret: the &quot;classical&quot; arrangements here sound much less forced and are really beautiful.  <br />I'm a bit tired of people labeling RDJ a &quot;genius,&quot; as though everything he puts out is pure gold. I think somehow the label genius is only applied if an artist has a prickly, attention-getting personality, a dash of charisma and fame-hunger. Why do people never say, for example, that Orbital are geniuses, when their Snivilization and In Sides albums show better consistency and have tracks that to my ear blow much of Aphex Twin's work out of the water? Who knows. Anyway, point being that this album is still a bit uneven like all Aphex Twin stuff. As is often the case with electronic artists, it seems as though RDJ has trouble finding good bridgesfor songs. Even the much-praised Alberto Balsam has a boring drum breakdown in the middle that bugs me every time. Like I said it's subliminal, and much more likely to put you in an altered state of consciousness, than stimulate the way the Richard D. James album does. Nevertheless it fully rates five stars, and if you are someone who's just curious about this &quot;Aphex Twin&quot; guy, you can't go wrong with this album or the Richard D. James album, though I'd start with the Come to Daddy EP, which is the purest distillation of RDJ's &quot;genius&quot; to date IMO.
B000066NW0|3.0|Avril Lavigne may have a &quot;punk&quot; image, what with her sideways baseball caps and baggy pants...but let's face it, the girl's music is not rock.  It is, however, standard pop fare driven by guitars to make it sound more edgy- perfect for young girls searching to find music &quot;cooler&quot; than Britney's but who are not ready to make the leap into listening to real rock bands.  That said, Lavigne's record does have two catchy songs, &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Skater Boi,&quot; and she does deliver a convincing vocal performance on &quot;I'm With You,&quot; but the rest of the tunes are rather forgettable.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Extremely disappointed with this.<br />The setting, Paris at the turn of the century, might have been so colorful, and instead it was Just Another Baz Boobscape;  he needs to step outside of himself a little bit, and approach the realization that not everybody sees the world through his lens of tawdrified sexuality.  The people on the Extra Features keep repeating that Baz is supposedly a great story-teller, so that you wonder if they believe it, simply because they keep repeating it to themselves.  Baz doesn't get anywhere near telling a story;  he is content with throwing together a quilt of cliché.  Somehow, he seems to suppose that he is doing something \\"new and brilliant,\\" where there isn't an idea in the whole of Moulin Rouge that doesn't come from either Vegas, or Lloyd Webber - neither of them what you would call a great artistic role model.<br />There is (or at any rate, was) actual talent in Baz;  you can see it in \\"Strictly Ballroom.\\"  But he needs an editor (or some other externally applied self-criticism faculty).  Pacing is appalling;  he alternates between rushing through an absence of narration, and tedious driving the same shtick into the ground.  The presentation is not stylized, as the commentary would have you believe;  only a cobbling out of shredded pop platitude.  \\"The Boy\\" spouts five pop-song lines about love, inviting us to consider how deep his understanding of love is ... well, exactly ... sets the tone for the whole.  Baz also tries to stretch Elton John's \\"Your Song\\" out to Mahlerian dimensions, at a stroke setting a new benchmark for Bloat.  If his goal was to create an audience who cringe involuntarily whenever they hear the phrase, \\"It's a little bit funny,\\" then perhaps the movie might be considered a kind of Pavlovian success.<br />Best acting in the film was Jim Broadbent.  Ewan MacGregor wasn't bad, it is only that his character is two-dimensional at fullest, a role which hardly made any demands on him;  his voice is fair, but monochrome, too consistently giving a just-this-side-of-strained sound, which wears, in a movie which would make wearisomeness a virtue.  It is hard to believe that Nicole Kidman is dying of consumption, another failed bit of storytelling on Baz's part (hint:  since so much of the movie is blue-ish tint, the audience has no clue that a certain two minutes of blue tint is supposed to imbue Kidman with Consumptive Pallor).  We might feel sorry for their thwarted love, if only we could believe that there was actual love there, where there was only a kind of pop-song medley.<br />Toulouse Lautrec might have been an interesting cultural element of the movie, only Baz trivializes him into just another dwarf element in little more than a visual circus.  The comic-book shallowness, which in \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is charmingly transcended ... is ineluctable Narrative Death in \\"Moulin Rouge.\\"  We saw this for professional reasons, and had hoped for rather better.  It is with genuine sorrow that we acknowledge that we need never see it again.
0553208845|3.0|Siddhartha is a pretty good and fun book to read. It contain a great storyline where reader themselves by reading this could also learn the teaching about the meaning of life that Siddhartha has gone through. This book shows how a monk would spend his whole life in search of an answer to a question.
B00005JMC6|3.0|While this movie has several good points, it lacks creativity in many areas. You watch the movie and then leave with several questions about the culture left unanswered. Perhaps because I kept hearing how good the movie was I expected more, but I did not get it. Keisha's performance was wonderful and so were the perfomances of the other actors, the story is simly lacking. It's a shame because this movie could have been so much more than it turned out to be. The scenery is beautiful, the music is perfect and the acting is superb. It's really too bad.<BR> I recommend this movie but it's not one that you'd want to watch more than once.
0811826848|4.0|I thought the book was excellently produced, but would have liked more input from non-Beatles and from sacked drummers (nudge nudge wink wink).   For instance, Lennon and McCartney recount the time they finished up &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; for the Rolling Stones; I'd like to have had a word from Mick Jagger and Keith Richards about that experience as well.<br />To the reviewer who complained that they were still slamming Pete Best's drumming ability and mental acuity, or lack thereof,  forty years on--that's not strictly true.  Pretty much all the statements in the book on that subject are at least 35 years old.  But I'd still like to have seen some more input from Pete, as well as a page or two regarding his post <BR>Beatles musical career.  He did actually have one, and did fairly well for a couple of years.  But, as this book presents him, he was basically a non-entity, just the last in a long line of drummers who occupied the Beatles' drum stool before Ringo came along.<br />There have been some conflicting reports on the musical skills of the various members of the band, ca. 1962.  McCartney's own brother said of the group at that time, none of them was a rocket scientist, musically speaking, and it could have been any one of them fate could have chosen to go.  Granted that statement was a bit disingenuous in retrospect, but wrt Pete Best it seems as if there was always an official policy in the Beatles' organization to purge his memory.   For instance, when the BBC tapes were put on CD, the first two shows, with Pete Best, were omitted due to problems with the 'sound quality'.   I've heard some of those performances, and the sound was fine.   The drumming wasn't fantastic, but seemed more than adequate in the context.
B0001IN080|5.0|A great idea to have a DVD that's also a CD, that's also a &quot;Special Features&quot; with recording-studio footage of his Live on AOL concert appearance.  Best thing about Michael? It isn't just a young guy hyping the comeback of &quot;big band music&quot;.  Nope. This guy's surrounded with equally young expert band members, and they all are obviously really into the music, the sound, and the legends behind that music.  Arrangements by David Foster and friends are outstandingly crisp. The concert footage is full of sound bites, and I found it interesting that the songs are multiple-cut from among several concerts - South Africa, England, others, some in black &amp; white, others in color, and are well edited together so you can enjoy a whole song but see it performed in multiple places. Interesting, fun, and always fresh and interesting.<BR>I've purchased copies for friends, and they're all glad they found about about Michael's incredible devotion to great music new and old.  The George Michael song, Kissing a Fool, is a winner!  Don Costa's arrangement of For Once in My Life sizzles.
B0001I561E|5.0|My wife and I were talking the other day while looking through our Disney DVD's for our 2 year old son. Both of us wondered why Aladdin wasn't part of the collection. Neither of us realized that it actually hadn't been released yet!! Whats THAT all about!?<br />I saw this movie in the theater with 2 friends when it was first released. There were a number of people in the audience including a lot of young children. The vast majority of laughs came from the adults including the 3 of us. This is a GREAT movie. Robin Williams is perfect. Kids will enjoy this movie, but it will be the adults that will appreciate the humor and probably end up liking it more than the kids.<br />I can't believe that over the last 14 years since its theatrical release it hasn't been released on DVD. It will be a long wait till October. <br />I have this movie on VHS, Laserdisk and the CD soundtrack. My DVD collection is lonely without it. I can't wait till October!
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I waited YEARS for this film to be released on DVD, and it is now one of the brightest gems in my movie collection.  If you're looking for the best adaptation of Emily Bronte's novel, then this is the film for you.  Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are perfectly cast as Catherine and Heathcliff, and although they both do a superb job, Fiennes steals the show as Heathcliff.  The scenes leading up to and directly following Catherine's death are absolutely heartbreaking, and I cry every time I watch it!  Binoche is wonderful in her dual role, and this is the only film version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; that manages to accurately depict the beauty of Bronte's novel.
0060934700|5.0|Most of what I would say has already been said in previous reviews.  I would simply add my voice to the chorus that praises this collection, and add that Gaiman's skill is such that days, weeks -- ages -- after reading these tales, they will continue to resonate for you.  It may be that your perceptions of stray cats is altered, or you find yourself less interested in shopping for bargains,  or you will find poetry more accessible,  or the night more eerie.....Whatever your flavor, there will be something in this collection for you.
B00000FYIL|5.0|I loved the movie &quot;Shakespeare in Love,&quot; and the soundtrack in one of my favorite CDs.  The music is absolutely beautiful and perfectly reflects the bittersweet moments of the film.  My favorite track is definitely the first one, &quot;Beginning of the Partnership,&quot; which is what I plan to walk down the aisle to for my wedding.
0671027387|4.0|I loved the story, but after reading The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I pretty much knew who the bad guy was going to be and how it ended.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I bought &quot;In the Zone&quot; and I was disappointed.  When I first bought it, I thought it would be good. Here's how I rate the songs.<br />1. Me Against the Music- It didn't work for me.  2/10<BR>2. (I Got That)Boom Boom- Pretty good. 6/10<BR>3. Showdown- Unmemorable.  3/10<BR>4. Breathe on Me- Very sensual.  8/10<BR>5. Early Mornin'- One of my favorites. 8/10<BR>6. Toxic- My favorite song on the album is this one.  10/10<BR>7. Outrageous- R. Kelly wrote and produced.  4/10<BR>8. Touch of My Hand- Good, but not great. 7/10<BR>9. The Hook Up- I skipped this one. ?/10<BR>10. Shadow- It was kind of weird. 4.5/10<BR>11. Brave New Girl- I liked this one. 9/10<BR>12. Everytime- A tribute to her ex, Justin. 6.5/10<BR>13. Me Against the Music(Remix)- This sounds better than the original.  5/10<br />This is my only Britney album, but this is probably her best.  The album wasn't total junk.  I did enjoy myself some of the time.<br />Overall- 5/10
B0001BKAEY|3.0|There are absolutely awesome scenes in Revolutions, and I caught myself with my mouth wide open at the scope of some of the battles.  The problem is that I felt both during and after than there should be so much more.  Here we are in the final and the characters that we have become familiar with (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus) are giving secondary roles.  Morpheus for his part plays little more than Chewbacca to Jada Smith's Han Solo.  Neo is gone for a large section of the movie and Trinity as a character hasn't developed in the past two movies.  <br />In the beginning of the movie, when things should become clearer, the movie introduces new concepts (the Train station scene) and when we meet the Frenchman again (after a long, and rather pointless battle), his character feels as if it has little purpose in this movie except to pout.  <br />Its unfortunate that the people who will get the most from this movie are the same people who also saw the Animatrix (where the Matrix mythology is better explained).  Basically, if you rely on the movies alone, Revolutions is shallow.  It only makes sense in my opinion if you see Animatrix first.<br />The main problem I have is that Reloaded and Revolutions seem like a step back from the concepts of the first Matrix.  In the Matrix, the battle scenes were spectacular but they had a purpose: they explained how Neo was gaining in power.  In Reloaded and especially in Revolutions, I got the sense that the Brothers added action for the sake of pace.  Some of the battles could have been substantially cut down or removed entirely, leaving more to elaborate on issues.<br />I enjoy watching movies that challenge me.  On the other hand, Reloaded and Revolutions became purposely and sloppily obtuse movies.  Judged on their own merits, the Matrix sequels fail.  They are shallow in places when there should be more exposition (i.e. the vampires in Reloaded, Agent Smith and his increase in power) and overkill when less would be so much more (the nightclub scene in Revolutions, the rave in Reloaded, and sentinal battle).
0375413405|5.0|I love to cook and I have bought many cookbooks over the years. This is my favorite french cook book ever!!!!!  This should be in everyone's collection.  I honestly think it is one of the few cookbooks that are worth the price.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I was in the front row of the first showing of \\"Star Wars\\" when it premiered at the Stanley Warner in Paramus, NJ back in '77. There was no hype, no lines, and Lucas hadn't even imagined that there would even be a sequel at that point. Than being said - it truly was a landmark film. What bothers me is that the original masterpiece will never be seen by future generations. For whatever reason, Lucas decided that he would rework it with all the digital wizardry he could muster. Should other landmark film be re-worked? A revised Citizen Kane or 2001 perhaps? Beyond restoration techniques that are utilized to restore a film back to the closest approximation to it's original incarnation, there is no legitimate reason to tamper with a masterpiece, let alone refuse to let the original ever be seen again. The added digital effects and scenes add little if nothing to the story. If anything there is an incongruity with the rest of the film. I had really hoped that the DVD medium would be used to showcase different versions of the film, allowing newer generations to experience the original as well as subsequent interpretations. These DVDs will fit nicely with, but not replace my Laserdisc versions of the \\"originals\\"...
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Perfect?  No . . . but very, very close.  Eric Clapton remains true to the depth and power of the originals.  At once, both in his singing and playing, Clapton manages to echo Robert Johnson -- while bringing his own potency to the interpretations.  He plays with sureness and a keen appreciation of the music.  He is a mature artist at the top of his game, surrounded by first-class players -- from Jerry Portnoy's harp to Steve Gadd's signature drum work to Billy Preston's dazzling turn on keys.  Thank you, Mr. Clapton.  Mr. Johnson is smiling.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I admit that \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" [not a great title!] was not on my must-see list. Now, having seem it, it is my must own DVD list. While its stars, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, are two of my all-time favorites, most recent romantic comedies have not been original, funny or, for that matter, particularly romantic. While the only thing in the least original about the movie is the fact that the leads are practically senior citizens, it is outrageously funny and extraordinarily romantic. <br />Harry [Nicholson] is a dedicated playboy who always dates young women. The sad thing is that he is now 63, perilously close to being old enough to be some of his girlfriends' grandfather. One summer day his latest flame, Marin [Amanda Peet], takes him on a weekend outing to her mother's beach house in The Hamptons. The couple is surprised to find that Erica [Keaton], the mom, is also visiting. Erica is a famous playwright. She writes romantic comedies, but, being 57 and divorced, she long ago gave up on falling in love again herself. Suddenly, Harry has a heart attack. The attending physician, Dr. Meyer [Keanu Reeves], suggests that Harry stay at Erica's house for awhile until he is strong enough to go back to New York. It turns out that Meyer has a thing for older women, and he begins to pursue Erica. Meanwhile, Harry's brush with death is causing him to rethink his life [maybe older ain't so bad], while Meyer is forcing Erica to rethink hers [maybe younger is the answer]. The ultimate solution to this love triangle is predictable, but the getting there is great fun. <br />Director/writer Nancy Meyers, herself 54, has written a mature, witty, sophisticated screenplay, but I think she herself knows that it is the magnetism of Keaton and Nicholson that makes the movie such a great success. [Interesting note: In real life the two once were lovers] The supporting cast is excellent and includes Amanda Peet Jon Favreau  and Frances McDormand.] <br />If there is a problem withthe movie, it is that it may be somewhat too sophisticated for today's mainstream audiences and critics. It has a very French feel to it, which is perhaps why the ending takes place in Paris.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Should I ever win the lottery, one of my first charitable acts will be to buy copies of this series and give them to everyone I know...<br />I don't love everything Joss Whedon has ever done, but this story is a testament to what he is capable of.
B0000CFW87|1.0|This Cd is just anoter typical piece of Josh Groban's garbage.  There isn't any good unique or different about him unless you consider singing lame sappy songs in dead languages a good thing.  There is nothing  positive that is distinguishing about him.  If you want good music you should listen to Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken, or even better his single Solitaire.  In Solitaire, Clay sings with more power and color than Josh Groban has, and looking at his &quot;progress&quot; so far, ever will.  I think listening to this is just a waste of time, and about anyone in the world must have better things to do.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|I liked the portion of the film when they were in the Hamptons. There were some very good scenes between Nicholson and Keaton, especially the one where they were walking on the beach. They lost me after they headed for the city though. There were too many strained coincidences, the Keaton character lost her edge and the ending was too far out, even for this genre. I also didn't care much for the DVD video quality, which I thought should have been better for a new movie. Still, there were enough good moments in the first hour to barely recommend it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|These really have proved to be some of the greatest films ever made. Not only do they have outstanding visual effect, but also spectacular acting (worthy of independent sensations). The DVD itself is loaded with hours of extras that will captivate one for days. Can't wait for the &quot;Return of the King!&quot;
B00004T9UF|4.0|I don't take &quot;Eminem&quot; too seriously, and don't think anyone else should either. He's like any other entertainer, entertainment. I do like him though, and think he has interesting things to say. I don't think his life is that unique, he raps about it, but who doesn't have problems? But musically speaking, this is a tight album. It's probably his most popular, and includes the tracks &quot;Kill You&quot;, &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, and &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;. Another big hit here is &quot;Stan&quot;, which is real good, and samples a catchy &quot;Dido&quot; song. I'd hesitate to call this one of the best rap albums ever, but it is the best of &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot;.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I love this film; it is so high-energy. The dances (and creative input of them into the film) are unlike most musicals that I have ever seen. Jones and Latifa steal the show, but Gere and Zellweger seem a little out of place to me (nothing that hurts the punch of the movie). What really impressed me, however, was the singing. I was very surprised that all the songs were not only catchy, but also \\"ear easy.\\"<br />The DVD itself is a **** star item. Great extras! Better film!
1400049628|4.0|Wow, I finished the book last friday, then I went to watch Dawn of the Dead(Remake) on Saturday feeling like a true \\"outbreak expert\\"!!    I liked this a lot, it was really entertaining stuff. Didn't give it 5 stars just because some notions about zombies that I personally like some other way like dealing with memory, physiology, etc. The \\"chronicles\\" in the last part of the \\"guide\\" are by themselves very good stories that could manage to really scare you.    Most important; with this book you'll learn all the \\"do's\\" and \\"do not's\\", you'll learn to sense if something is happening, what to do if you're catch unprepared, how to defend yourself and your loved-ones, how to fight-back, how to hunt them, how to destroy them! Know your enemies and what them are capable of, what them really are, and ultimately how to remain alive.    I assure you this: once you have finished, you´ll pack your stuff, get your weapons ready, and by all means you´ll escape... FAST, QUIETLY, FAR AWAY!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This was 100 times better than the original! The visual effects were so enjoyable, and the acting was greatly improved. I wasn't really looking foward to this film, but now that I have seen it I can't wait for another. Great buy.<br />Great extras as well!
0743454529|5.0|I have read all of Jodi Picoult's books and have enjoyed them all.  However, none of them have captivated me like this one, and none of them have been as emotional or as sad.  I couldn't stop reading this book, and when it was over I couldn't stop crying.  I think that it is one of the best books I've read in a really long time.  It makes you think and it makes you feel.  Don't miss reading this one.
B00018D44U|5.0|I like it better than her first album, more mature and with more breadth.  There is more to her than just a light voice.  There is a lot of depth here and more variety as well.  She is growing into her music.
B00003CXB4|1.0|OK...Disney could have done a lot better here. For one, the layout of the DVD is a total disgrace. I had to sit for hours trying to find the &quot;real&quot; version of the film (without that silly Morning Report song) and finally found it under &quot;Languages&quot;. Of course, I should have looked there first. How silly of me.<BR>The animation has been completely changed - if you have the old VHS version you should compare them. The crocodiles with the birds in their mouths are completely different in  I Just Cant Wait to be King, and the colors in the film have been changed to brighter, more bolder colors which make the scenery look totally unrealistic compared to the VHS. Seriously, is this some sort of joke? I grew up with this movie, and now that Im older I was excited to see it again after all those years, but I was just disappointed. I am hoping that disney are trying to trick us and will release something much better than this. This DVD was the biggest waste of money. EVER.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember very clearly watching the previews for this show when it came out. My constant reaction when I saw them? &quot;This is going to be crap&quot;. <br />What was one of the first things they show? The pilot of the ship playing with the dinosaurs and sounding like an idiot. In the episode, and when you know the character a bit, it made perfect sense in the episode. Standing alone in a preview of a show that hasn't been released yet? It made it look like an unbelievably cheesy piece of &quot;thrown together Sci-Fi&quot; junk.<br />Unfortunately, I never watched a single episode when it aired because the previews made it look so stupid. Nothing could be farther from the truth though. This show is absolutely amazing. I've loved every episode and am dying to know the stories behind the shepherd, what was actually done (and why) to River, and the list goes on. I LOVED this DVD set. <br />It is a true crime that due to the worst possible representation of a new show with a terrible preview, not to mention not airing the intended pilot, this show was doomed to be cut from the network.<br />My only hope is that with the increasing sales, word of mouth, and 5 star average after 750+ reviews, that someone will pick this show back up.
B000084T18|1.0|Theres nothing unique in this album. Its all been said before, and said in better words by other artists. The trend these days are people having an excess of money, sex, and living precarious lives. Ideas expressed continually for years now. Those who buy this album are puppets of corporate music. If you want to buy a hiphop album thats actually worth your time and money get \\"The Unseen\\" by Quasimoto. or \\"No Man's Land\\" by Souls of Mischief. Dont even waste your 50 cents on this album.
B000065EXI|1.0|I bought this CD because I loved Diana Krall's 'The Look of Love'. But 'Love Scenes' is nothing like it - there is only one song I like and that is &quot;I Miss You So&quot;.  I also bought 'When I Look in Your Eyes' and wasn't impressed by that CD either.  Granted, these two were earlier works.  Later, 'The Look of Love' was a huge success for Diana (and I can see why) - but maybe that'll be as good as she gets(?)
0385504209|5.0|Filled with riddles, intrigues, and unexpected outcomes, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; by Dan Brown can practically be called a puzzle book.  Not only does it keep the reader's mind alert, it also quenches the reader's thirst for knowledge.  Filled with interesting facts and opinions on art and religion, the book challenges the reader to question his own beliefs about religion.<br /> &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; follows Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu's desperate search for the Holy Grail in order to preserve its ancient secrets.  Along their journey they find themselves connected with these secrets in more ways than they could have ever imagined.  &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is destined to become a well-loved classic.
B00005JMSE|4.0|I was expecting something along the lines of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen when I caved in to go see Hellboy last night; you know, a bunch of unlikely paranormal misfit heroes working together to save the world from destruction.  Okay, well, it was a lot like TLEG in theory, but much better in practice. Comic books turned into movies don?t normally thrill me, but in this movie it wasn?t difficult for me to suspend my disbelief in spite of some stretched plot lines.<br />Ron Perlman plays Hellboy, who is apparently an imp from a rift in the universe that occurred as a result of tampering by the German army during WW2.  Something went terribly wrong with their ?experiment?, resulting in a few people and things being sucked in from our universe to the other side in exchange for?what? before the hole was shut down.  He is raised lovingly in an American government facility by the bespectacled professor that discovered/rescued him in Scotland.  A couple of other paranormal misfits ? Liz the firestarter  and Abe the blue psychic fish man ? are basically his adopted siblings.  The trio is trained to use their powers for heroic good.  Their existence is of course top secret, which explains why there are public rumors everywhere about Hellboy.<br />But wait?those nahtzis (spelled wrongly on purpose!) aren?t dead yet! They have unleashed Hellish creatures upon our world, which only multiply when they are slain.  In fact they?ve come back for the now-grown Hellboy sixty years later so that he can complete his destiny, which is somehow tied in with reopening that rift between universes.  The legendary Rasputin (who has occultic powers of his own) has concocted this plot to lure Hellboy and his entourage for a final showdown in Moscow.<br />The plot had its flaws but the visuals had none.  I liked the action sequences and special effects, which centered mainly on the multi-tentacled creatures that Hellboy and co. spend most of the movie destroying.  CGI and makeup were used flawlessly to create the human and beastly monsters.  There was also a nice romance subplot between Liz (Selma Blair) and Hellboy, which begged the question; can a man overcome the monster within himself for the sake of love?  Yes, echoes of Perlman?s former tv role, but with a lot more testosterone and realistic emotions.  It was a surprisingly UNcheesy love story amidst all the action.<br />I could have wished for more backstory about Abe and Liz, but that?s my only real gripe.  It comes down to this:  do you like action movies, comic books and/or rooting for weird superheroes?  Then you?ll probably enjoy Hellboy.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle.flawlessly to create the human and beastly monsters.

0385504209|3.0|I enjoyed the book and found the premise to be facinating.  Good thing, because the details are tough to get through--very technical in some aspects.<br />Unfortunately, the hype surrounding the book somewhat spoils it.  Even more unfortunate, Dan Brown (author) does not draw a clear line between historical fact, his own hypothesis, and sraight out fiction. The reader, will need to read all of this with a grain of salt.  The storyline has just enough elements of truth to be plausible, but not probable.  Remember, IT'S FICTION!
B0000019PA|4.0|This album had a major impact in my life at the time I bought it. Nowadays it's a bit left aside, but every once in a while I unearth it anew and remember what a wonder it is. Highly recommended. Try to find the beauty in the lyrics and in Jeff Mangum's voice. If you can't, just listen to it as a good, cleverly produced rock album. I challenge you not to rock out on the untitled tenth track. Some people say that the lyrics are childish or that the vocals are just plain awful, but it's undeniable that this album has an utter integrity, from the cover to the sleeve art to the music. Do give this a try. You'll either love it or hate it, but it will certainly be a remarkable experience, and that's what this record was made to be, really.
B000002UB3|2.0|George Harrison's album...period.<br />George's two tracks lifted an otherwise mediocre effort laden with self indulgent tracks by John (I Want You) and Paul's usual silliness (Maxwell's Silver Hammer) that dates back to the mid 60s.  Here Comes the Sun and Something save the album.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I really was very doubtful about buying this one. Though I've enjoyed a couple of Britney's previous numbers, I've never bought a Britney CD. Me against the music was an average song and then came the infectious Toxic which I really liked. But that was only one song and I didn't think I should spend so much money just for that. The sample music didn't help me and when I read the reviews here (one-star reviews) I took a step back. <BR>I finally bought it a couple of weeks ago and I have to admit that I enjoyed almost every song on the CD. <BR>Favourites are Toxic, Breathe on me, Everytime, Touch of my hand, Shadow, Brave new girl, Showdown. <BR>Every song on the CD has the potential to be a single. Her voice isn't very good but I couldn't imagine someone else singing her kind of songs and sounding good. But other than this one drawback and a couple of fillers, this CD is almost perfect. I recommend to all pop music listeners.
B00008WG3U|4.0|This nofx album is really, not their best but its got some powerful and catchy songs like the separation of church and skate. Just buy it, dont think about it too much.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I won't buy this for two reasons:<br />1) Fox is probably ripping us off again.  After two Alien box sets, three versions of X-men, and many other examples where they released multiple editions; there is no way I'm going to fall for it again.  I know that if I buy this box set, in four or five years Fox will release a better seven disc version, with both versions of the films and loaded with extras.  Which leads to the other reason I won't buy this.<br />2) I want the original versions of these movies.  I don't want to see Greedo awkwardly shooting the wall before Han fires.  I don't want to see Boba Fett looking into the camera as he walks by.  I don't want to hear the Storm Trooper say \\"oomph\\" as he bumps into the door.  I don't want to see Han walk over jaba's tail.  I don't want to watch the terrible re-edit of the end of Empire.  I don't want to have Luke say \\"You're lucky to be alive\\" rather than \\"You're lucky you don't taste very good.\\"  Worst of all, I don't want Luke to make that goofy scream as he's falling at the end of empire.<br />None of these things were in the original versions of the films.  They are \\"special\\" additions.  They wasted time putting in all those idiotic things, yet didn't fix the red boxes around the tie fighters and asteroids.  George Lucas, who fought against the colorization of Black and White movies, ruined his own films by adding unnecessary baggage.  I won't buy a Star Wars movie until I can purchase the original theatrical versions.
031286504X|5.0|If Bram Stoker had been a middle class American in 1976, this would have been Dracula. Judging solely on the cover and maybe what somebody told you about I Am legend, you might assume that this is a straightforward horror read, a pulp 10 cent-er from the fifties. What this novel really does well is lull the reader into thinking the hero, Robert Neville, is totally safe in his baricaded house, which is what Neville seems to think. How wrong he was.<br />Most of the begining of the book is Neville skulking around his empty house drinking lots of whiskey and mourning the death of his wife and daughter. Its only when he can shrug the booze off and venture outside that things actually take a turn for the worse. if he had stayed in his house and got drunk non-stop, he would only become victim to crippling depression and a burnt out liver, instead of the undead and the suffering living preying on him.<br />one thing this novel does that no other Vampire book I've ever read is to inject some science into Vampires, the victims of a horrid plague that makes them feast on blood and avoid sunlight. A good portion of Neville's time is spent trying to understand the plague, and for a while it helps keep his mind off of his problems and he actually learns lots about vampires.<br />In conclusion, this is an amazing novel that I had trouble putting down. If you are a fan of movies like night of the living dead or 28 days later you owe it to yourself to read the inspiration. BUY THIS BOOK!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|After seeing this movie, I was convinced the the time was right to propose to my sweetheart. I did less than a week later and she said yes.<br />Not really a review, but a story I proudly share.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Far from the best album of 2003!<br />The original was just barely keeping up with the times when it was released in 1970, as Led Zep and Pink Floyd had passed them by. There was no need to reproduce this 30 years later.  Oh, other than money and ego, of course.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I read that other review that sounds so bitter, like he(?) feels abandoned by the '90s or something.  Chill, dude.  Creed is awesome.  You either like them or you don't. And if you're afraid of getting some kind of spiritually in-tune message, just stick with the same tired lyrics the other bands keep pumping out, turn off your brain, and stop complaining.
B0000024W3|5.0|...they basically say it sucks. I like it. To me it's meditative. I came on to this site to give it 5 stars expecting to see 3 or less. I'm glad to see that there are other people out there that &quot;get it.&quot; I have listened to Bob alot and for most of my adult life. I never bought this album (because of reviews) or heard it until recently. In the the 70's I had a Dylan album called &quot;Dylan&quot; that was not as long lasting but sounded alot like this one (it actually had &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot; on it). I liked it for the same reason (to me alot of 70's Dylan is meditative). If you are a true Dylan fan you will love this. If didn't get into &quot;Planet Waves&quot; and other 70's Dylan you may not.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Finally, Britney has said what she wants to say, and its about time! In this, her latest album, Britney opens up more, and transitions finally from that pop-princess to the sex icon that we've all wanted her to be! So here's a little song by song review on the entire sexually influnced record:<BR>1.Me Against The Music (ft. Madonna)-A good song, which was a smart choice for the first single, especailly after the kiss, but compared to the other tracks this one can't carry a note. But still one that you should listen to. 7/10.<br />2.(I Got That) Boom Boom (ft. Ying Yang Twins)-this song is itching to what we want to hear from Britney, but doesnt' get there. The song is okay, but is worse than Me Against The Music, something that you honestly DONT want to happen. The rap from the Ying Yangs makes this song even worse. 5/10.<br />3.Showdown-Finally! A Britney song that lets Britney speak whats on her mind. This song has cool beats, which isnt a suprise since its from Bloodshy and Avant who create the best music on the entire album. 9/10.<br />4.Breath On Me-HOT! There is so much sexual energy put within this song, that it makes you have to listen to it over and over, and it makes you think, \\"what just happened?\\". Deffinetly one of the best songs on the entire album.10/10.<br />5.Early Mornin'-this song a lot of people seem to like, and honestly, i dont know why. I think this song is bland and trys to be sexy way to hard. It's really boring, but you'll hear worse on this album. 7/10.<br />6.Toxic-THE BEST FREAKIN' SONG ON THE ENTIRE ALBUM! this song is sexy without even trying, and it's very catchy as well! Also produced by Bloodshy and Avant. 10/10.<br />7.Outrageous-this song is very r'n'b, but still sounds great. It has some backing vocals by the producer--R. Kelly, but the song's lyrics are awsome, \\"outrageous...my sex drive\\". 9/10.<br />8.Touch Of My Hand-HOLY HOTNESS! This song will make Christina Aguilera's song, 'Dirrty', clean! The song is very sexual, and if you see LIVE IN MIAMI, you will NOT believe your eyes! 10/10.<br />9.The Hook up-i really really like this song, but for some reason i think that Sean Paul MUST sing on this track! It's perfect for him! 10/10.<br />10.Shadow-a ballad. Enough said. 9/10.<br />11.Brave New Girl-this is a really funky up-tempo legally blonde type song that makes you have to groove cool moves! 10/10.<br />12.Everytime-ballad. again. but a good one! 10/10.<br />The next track is a remix of Me Against The Music, and i would like to say, it doenst improve the song too much!<br />OVERALL:<BR>the best brit CD!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I don't care what anybody says this album is great! The song American Life took some time to grow on me, but now it's one of my favorites. I think Love Profusion would have made a much better First single from the album. The American Life single just should not have been the first. As a matter of fact, right now would have been a great time to release the song American Life as the anti-war movement seems to be gearing up. Anyway, if you don't have this album now then you must get it. American Life puts Janet Jackson's latest effort to shame. Damito Jo is just so bland and dry.
B000002UAO|2.0|While a couple of songs are OK, songs like Michelle and You Won't See Me are a disappointing departure from the music that initially made the Beatles so great.
0930289528|5.0|Written in the early 1980s, V for Vendetta tells of an England in the then near future of 1997-8.  A limited nuclear exchange devastates much of the world while England is directly unaffected.  However, the enormous economic and political ramifications of the conflict hurl the nation into anarchy.  Out of the ashes arises the fascist Norsefire regime.  Sure they restore order to the fallen country, but this is clearly a case of the serum being more lethal than the poison.  This new government sends blacks, homosexuals, Jews, and other minorities to death camps.  The culture of the pre-War world is now deemed as evil and subversive.  A corrupt police force is implemented with the authority to murder suspects if they wish  instead of adhering to ideals such as due process.  The average citizen is forced to work for starvation wages, and sometimes to crime just to survive.  Freedom, democracy, and privacy are as archaic concepts as the world being flat.  Then comes V, whose motto is the title of my review.  Translated from Latin it means: \\"By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe.\\"<br />Replete with Guy Falkes regalia, V seeks to bring about an end to the Norsefire party through a series of assassinations, bombings, and kidnappings.  At first, they appear to be revenge against everyone who worked at the prison camp where V was held.  Instead, the plot turns out to be more complicated and planned out than anyone could possibly imagine.  V doesn't strike the Norsefire at their body, he strikes for their heart - and never misses.  He has a contingency plan in the form of 16 year-old Evey Hammond, a girl he rescues from corrupt cops when she is forced into prostitution by her intolerably low wages.  Of course, Evey doesn't agree with all of V's methods; but it is through him that she learns the very essence of freedom, and how she may be the true hope of England in its darkest hour.<br />VfV is not just a great graphic novel, it is required reading period.  So what else can you expect from Alan Moore, who also brought us Watchmen, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and a lot of other things that raised the bar for the comic book medium.  I especially love the repeated use of the letter \\"V\\" throughout the story.  Beware, there is violence, objectionable language, and a little nudity.  The violence is really nothing when compared to a title from Marvel's MAX line. The language is pretty much the same thing you'd hear from a PG-13 movie.  And the nudity is not for the purpose of titilation, it represents the symbolic idea of freedom.  Even with my warning, VfV merits nothing except extreme recommendation from me.ding period.

B00005JMSE|5.0|I am a former comic geek, and have stayed the hell away from most of the adaptations in recent years (except for Extraordinary Gentlemen, what a mistake) from the genre. I am not sure why I went to see this (a Ron Perlman jones?) but it was truly wonderful. The art direction was breathtaking (you could see how the frame from the book had been rendered into the scene, and then the film took it further). I haven't read the books, but now I'm tempted. A little overlong (the last monster is anticlimatic) but all in all not a wasted moment and a well acted movie to boot. Probably one of the ten best comic book movies ever.

B00009TB5G|5.0|Definitely one of the best DVDs of 2003, this is loaded with special features and deleted scenes. I was especially happy that they put back in the part where Merry and Pippin find the Orthanc stores in the end with all the food and the Longbottom Leaf... one of my favorite parts of the book. The special features are all very cool (especially the 'Cameras of Middle Earth' part) and the cast commentary is, as usual, absolutely hilarious! The only thing is that I wish they had included another behind-the-scenes cast documentary as they did on the first DVD (The Fellowship of the Ring Special Edition), such as the &quot;Day in the Life of a Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Fellowship of the Cast&quot; <BR>Overall - A+

Either the female decendant or some one who is not in the lineage will become chief.  You can guess the ending, but the middle is so good that this is not a problem.
0735619670|5.0|The original Code Complete has long been regarded by many serious software developers as a &quot;must have&quot; compilation of software construction best practices.  CC2 has similar breadth and depth and has been thoroughly updated to include discussion of emerging methodologies as extreme programming and best practices such as refactoring.<br />Steve McConnell provides a balanced, thoughtful discussion of competing opinions along with a wealth of references to additional materials covering specific topics in more detail.  At the same time, McConnell has a clear voice articulating his judgment on various controversial topics.<br />Overall, CC2 is an essential book to include in your library whether you're just starting out in your career or an old grey hair responsible for mentoring teams.  In both cases, CC2 puts a mountain of software construction best practices at your fingertips.
B00005M989|2.0|It's hard to look at the career of one of this generation's greatest talents and fairly represent him with a package that mostly covers only a few of his best-selling albums. While a few random hits are thrown in the mix, this collection dwells too heavily on the albums Purple Rain, 1999, and Diamonds and Pearls. If that's all you want from Prince, I think you're better off just getting a copy of each of these fantastic and commercially successful albums. The fact of the matter is this is just not the very best of Prince, as the name implies. For the most part, these are only the most over-played songs in his collection. There is not a single song from Controversey or Dirty Mind, two of Prince's most ground-breaking albums. There is not one song on this package that was released past 91'. Where's Bat Dance? Where's The Most Beautiful Girl in the World? Where's Do Me Baby? This package is only the same thing you have heard a hundred times before. If you want a good representation of Prince, get The Hits collection. I prefer the 3 disk set because it has some fantastic B-Sides that are rare yet very catchy. This is only a fast money-making scheme by Warner Bros. Don't buy into this commerical foolishness.
B0000025H6|4.0|OK OK so the wall is genious,BUT-as far as aging well this cd comes in like 6th because at the time the things roger goes on about were very great to hear about and if you are old this cd probably makes alot more sence and you'd like it more.<BR>However big a genious he was this was a much different stroke for the Pink Floyd sound, this is a wonderful cd but not in the same way<br />Waters was once the leading force in Pink Floyd but i think somewhere between their 3 best  cds Animals,DSOTM, and WYWH David Gilmour became alot better of a leader.Waters became to obsessed with HIS music he ruined it for everyone.He was one of the best producers bass players of all time until this point when he kicked out their &quot;useless&quot; keyboardist even though he made them who they were 1/4. and i mean seriously all the gilmour songs on here and basicly any song not fully made by roger are the standout songs he shunned their amazing drummer too i mean watch pompeii,so along with rogers worsening ability to make PLEASING music to the average darkside listener the cd gives a really bad feeling of them breaking up and for all who will say this review sucks i don't know i'm just not with you guys I really liked Daves touch alot more so thanks for the demise of the best Pink Floyd sound that there ever was and for treating geniouses who you grew up with like no ones you DOOSCH<br />AND<BR> I WAS wrong this is much better than the final cut i really don't like any of that cd that much it starts off good soemtimes but rarely finishes off like a &quot;final cut&quot; not now john would be so cool without those stupid girl singersi wish it were dave in the background.so even though rogers new style was good enough to like the old was better and he was blind by his ego to see this i wonder if he has noticed yet <br />SO YOU GET 4 STARS <BR>but just think if this cd didn't have comfortably numb or hey you(AGAIN WHY IS THIS NOT IN THE MOVIE) and run like hell ( DAVES OR MOSTLY DAVES)would you liek thsi cd so much??  tell me what you think??? <br />4/5--

In Austrailia, up until 1970, mixed children(Aboriginal mother/white father) could be taken away from their mothers and trained in the ways of the white Austrailians and then adopted by a white family.  This is the story of a family divided by this policy and the struggle to reunite.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Heat is one of the best crime dramas of the 20th Century..
B00005JMEW|5.0|How can half of a movie be supremely satisfying as a viewing experience? That's just one of the remarkable accomplishments of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Volume 1, a masterpiece of cinematic style. Volume 1 is merely half of a story, which has Uma Thurman chasing down the bad guys (and girls) who left her for dead, yet it was certainly the single most enjoyable, satisfying movie that I saw in 2003. <br />  <br />It's been over a decade since Tarantino blew us all away with Pulp Fiction, and in the time since we have probably forgotten just what a remarkable talent he is. In all that time we only had one film, 1997's Jackie Brown, an underrated gem that didn't cause a tenth of the stir that Pulp Fiction did. It failed to connect with a wide audience the way its predecessor did, probably due to the fact that it completely defied most expectations. To me, however, it was further proof that Tarantino was one of our best filmmakers. Now, Tarantino returns with two films that tell one story. Kill Bill, Volume 1 is the first part of the story featuring The Bride (Uma Thurman) tracking down and killing the criminals that left her (and her unborn child) for dead in a wedding chapel. That's the premise, but there is so much going on in this film, that descriptions just don't do it justice. Kill Bill was conceived as an homage to all of the flicks that Tarantino grew up watching: kung-fu films, samurai films, spaghetti westerns, crime dramas, action films, gangster films, Japanese anime, etc. He has taken all of those styles and created a big, delicious cinematic blend of styles and genres. This is quite simply a spectacular movie in every respect. Kill Bill is pure cinema, from the first frame to the last. Every shot is so infused with a love for the art of filmmaking that it can't help but rub off on the viewer. Every aspect of the film, cinematography, acting, editing, dialog, music, set design, is used flawlessly to its absolute potential. Every scene effectively conveysa different mood and brings to mind a different film genre, from Thurman's suburban fight with Vivica Fox to the awesome spectacle of the showdown in the House of Blue Leaves. Kill Bill demonstrates just what a filmmaker can do with inspiration and true passion for his material. It is a beautiful, beautiful film. As one critic eloquently stated, \\"It's the most gorgeous B-movie ever made.\\" It also demonstrates how much can be achieved without computer animation. There might be some computer-generated or assisted imagery in Kill Bill, but it is absolutely minimal. Tarantino did everything retro style, including the amazing fight scenes. It's all just stuntmen on wires, no computers. He collaborated with Yeun Wo-Ping, the world-renowned choreographer who did the fight scenes in The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The fight scenes are indeed spectacular. Tarantino reveals himself as a skilled action director. However, the film is not all action. It is heavy on back-story and characterization. <br /> <br />The film is accompanied by an amazing soundtrack, one of my all-time favorites. Starting with Nancy Sinatra's \\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\\", then launching into a wide variety of musical types. There are themes from the likes of Bernard Herrmann and Luis Bacalov, a Japanese ballad from Meiko Kaji, a rockabilly Charlie Feathers tune, Santa Esmeralda's disco-flamenco-rock cover of \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" and perhaps the piece that's used to the most stunning effect in the movie: Zamfir's The Lonely Shepherd\\". This one piece of music perfectly captures the feel of the film. <br />       <br />If you are like me and passionately love Quentin Tarantino, and movies and cinematic technique in general, this movie was made for you. It is a truly remarkable film that cinema lovers should treasure. Plus, it's a whole lot of fun too. Very few movies that are this well-crafted are this much fun to watch. Kill Bill (volumes 1 and 2) is a film for the ages, destined for immortality.

B00006V9A0|5.0|It's hard to believe that Kurt Cobain has been gone for ten years now. Listening to this &quot;Best-Of&quot; Nirvana CD, on the ten-year anniversary of Cobain's tragic suicide, I'm reminded quite plainly of what a musical genius Kurt was, and how pioneering Nirvana were. Kurt &amp; his two partners in crime, bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, turned the music business inside out with their powerful, trailblazing, *passionate* rock music, and they finally kicked those pathetic hairspray/metal bands right off the map. There will never be another voice &amp; songwriter like Cobain, and there will never be another Nirvana, which is sad.But what does remain of Kurt &amp; company, and what WILL be their legacy, is the music they did create, and &quot;Nirvana&quot; is a brilliant overview of their all-too-brief existence. All of the band's best-known tunes are here, including The Shot Heard Round The World, better known as &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; &quot;Come As You Are,&quot; &quot;Lithium,&quot; &quot;In Bloom,&quot; &quot;Heart-Shaped Box,&quot; &quot;Pennyroyal Tea,&quot; &quot;Dumb,&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot; (the MTV Unplugged version). But considering that you may have all these tunes in your collection already, the main hook for buying &quot;Nirvana&quot; is, of course, the previously unreleased song, &quot;You Know You're Right,&quot; the very last song Nirvana ever recorded. With it's slow &amp; steady, assured build-up, followed by a classic thunderous full-throttle attack and Kurt's tortured voice &amp; lyrics, this song is in instant Nirvana classic. &quot;Nirvana&quot; is worth getting just for the inclusion of &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; alone, but it is also worth getting as a tribute to a great musical genius and his great, trailblazing band. All the proof needed on why Kurt Cobain &amp; Nirvana were--and are--so great is all here on this one CD. Thank you Kurt, and thank you, Nirvana. You are remembered.
B00006G8K0|5.0|This picture is seminal in that it is the first partnership between Christopher Lee and the wonderful Peter Cushing in the Hammer Dracula series.  Arguably the best of the series.  This film still holds the power to shock today--despite the lack of heads being ripped from their torsos.  From the first moment, one is transfixed by the Scarlet Blood dripping over the tomb with &quot;Dracula&quot; engraved upon the crypt lid.  This was very alluring in the 1950's.  Vampirism and colour were a very new thing indeed.  Peter Cushing while maintaining some semblance of humanity is every bit as ruthless to destroy Dracula as Dracula is to destroy those who dared to violate his sanctum.  Though not completely faithful to the book, one will find this movie an enjoyable and frightening venture into the Hammer world of Horror.  I am only waiting for the equally terrible: Brides of Dracula to be released on DVD.  The immediate sequel to Horror of Dracula, though missing Lee as Dracula, this film is even more inspired in its images of horror.  And it is a master stroke to have one of Dracula's disciples: David Peel, actually appear with blond hair.  The perfect angel, which makes him the perfect devil when he suddenly transforms.  Peter Cushing is also in Brides of Dracula.

0385335482|5.0|I was a bit leery of this book since I'm not much of a shopper, but rave reviews convinced me to buy it. I was completely engrossed - even on my honeymoon to Tahiti! Sophie Kinsella has an amazing knack for character development, and while reading the book, I felt like *I* was deeply in debt and getting myself into all kinds of predicaments. The book caused me to laugh out loud. It was a purely fun read and is one of those books you just can't put down. As soon as I'd finished it, I ordered the other two books in the series, and I still haven't been satisfied. A great read!
B0001I561E|5.0|I LOVE ALADDIN ... i have been waiting and waiting for it to come out on DVD.  It is absolutely without a doubt my favorite Disney movie.  I think what makes it the best is the AMAZING music, no other movie has come close in my book. EVERY song is good, not one, not two, ALL of them are beautiful, catchy, and fun!  It's too bad Disney can't produce music that beautiful nowadays...oh well..I give Aladdin 5 stars all the way
B00003CXFV|5.0|Erin Brckovich, Directed by Steven Soderbergh was an outstanding movie in my view. This movie was about a single mother who was determined to make ends meet for her three children and herself. Erin Brockovich's had to struggle to get her job by being turned down, and everything in her life was being challenged by car accident,undependable babysitters and a house with cockroaches crawling on your food. Erin was so determined to make a name for herself that she didn't take no for an answer with a law firm who tried to turn her down for a job. As Erin persued her career with this law firm she still was encoountered by challenges with the employee's at the firm as she was not very well liked by fellow workers. This just seemed to make her want to even work harder to prove to this firm she was well worth her weight. Julia Roberts definetly played this role perfect as she was able to be a single mom but,also a very educated woman who had the will,and determination to make things happen for this law firm. <BR>    In my view I feel this is one of the best movies Julia Roberts played as an actress who made her way to the top in this movie. She had so many obstacles in the way which made her give it all she had to succeed. This is a must see movie!!!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|now this is a rock cd!!! I heard the single &quot;like a stone&quot; and absolutly loved it so i bought the album. I listened through it start from finish, and Damn was it awesome!! I just listen to this album and get into this zone, were cornell's lyrics and the band's rocking just clicks. It's kinda like bread and butter it just seems right! Anways just buy it, and liten to it, and hopefully they'll make another.
0385336810|4.0|As soon as I saw this novel by Sophie Kinsella, masterful author of the Shopaholic series, I grabbed it off of the shelf and shirked all weekend chores to polish it off. Kinsella has not lost her ability to get her character into a sticky &quot;I can't believe this is happening&quot; situation.<br />It was a fun read - that's for sure. But the ending was rather disappointing - lots of build-up for a predictable, not-completely-satisfying conclusion. It almost seemed like Kinsella tried to cop-out of developing the ending, as if she were tired of writing the book. <br />Emma, the main character, is likeable and believable, but just so similiar to Becky from the Shopaholic series. Sure, she's got her own quirks... but I think the problem is in Kinsella's wonderful writing voice - the writing style between the novels is so similiar that the reader is bound to make comparisons, even when the descriptions are different. I didn't think Emma was quite as engaging as Becky; when reading Shopaholic, I began to feel like I was the one with an overdrawn account.<br />This is a good read, but some of Kinsella's creativity was lost. I almost wish she'd focused her efforts on a fourth Shopaholic book. I mean, can you imagine what Becky would be like trying to decorate a nursery and preparing for motherhood?
B00005JMNA|5.0|I love this movie very much becasue it takes place in cuba and diego luna and romola garai are great in it.I love the dance moves and the romance they had this movie has a great meaning it is that evening if your shy or u think u cant do any thing u can thats the meaning of this movie.The soundtrack is great i love the sapinsh and salsa music put together and i love the director who mad this movie.this movie is a thumps up who ever did not see it go see it its a great movie for the family and it teachers u a lesson never to give up in life.
B00000JZC4|3.0|I guess you can say Filter has shown their best on this cd, but certainly better than Short Bus rather. The problem with their first cd is that they didn't have a lot of variety. The songs were the same, same type of heavy metal all over again. This also applies to the tracks released for soundtracks, not as impressive. When Title Of The Record came out, and &quot;Take A Picture&quot; was their first single, my immediate thought is that these guys are good. When I picked up the album, I felt less impressed then I was with single, but still the album brought me to my feet. <br />1. Sand - This is the most weakest start to a cd. It should have been a part of Welcome To The Fold. So, overall the most boring track on the cd...2/10<BR>2. Welcome To The Fold - Heaviest song I have heard in a while. A wall of guitars applied with a cool bass and awesome drums. 10/10<BR>3. Captain Bligh - Richard Patrick's words saying &quot;I am grieving man I can't believe the things I've done to you&quot;...would not be the lyrics I would pick for the song, even though it works well. The song has a good song structure, but not as strong to my taste. The only part of the song that moves me is the outtro to the song in which it is acoustic and electronic drums and the vocals are perfect with Rich singing &quot;I've tried to pray yes I will give it a shot.&quot; 7/10<BR>4. She's Gonna Kill Me - Spectacular song, the lyrics could have been improved but yes it's pretty good. 9/10<BR>5. The Best Things - I don't really know why this song wasn't really successful on the radio. It is a great song. 10/10<BR>6. Take A Picture - This was one of the most popular songs on the radio, but it's nothing compared to any of the other songs on the cd. Still good though. 8/10<BR>7. Skinny - It is a great tune. The lyrics in the verses are the main problem, though. They don't really have a good feel to the song. The chorus brings out the song, again showing that they can be heavy. 7/10<BR>8. I Will Lead You -Possibly one of the best songs on the cd. This song should have been a single. Great song to listen to over and over again. 9/10<BR>9. Cancer - Good song, though a horrible structure to it. When the final chorus kicks in, and it's all heavy, it's the best part of the song. 6/10<BR>10. I'm Not The Only One - Bad song, this song is when the singer screams &quot;I'm Not The Only One&quot; in the chorus over and over again. It's too much, it gives me a headache. 5/10<BR>11. Miss Blue - This is the actual best song of the cd. Everytime I listen to it, I almost cry because the vocals are beautiful so are the lyrics. The guitars are excellent, the drums just give an excellent feel to the slow beat of the song. 15/10<br />I would not put this cd on a chart of the best cds in years. I wouldn't put this on the best cd of 1999. Although, if you are a big fan of Filter and you want to hear some of their old stuff, this is a must buy.
076790592X|3.0|This book was well written, but it didn't appeal to me that much. It's a very fast read though, which may suit you. If you want to read a book about life, i recommend &quot;Evolution of a Warrior A Book of Personal Transformation&quot; by Christopher J. Regan
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I said it with ReLoaded, and I stand by my statement...the Matrix should have been one movie and that is it. This movie is an improvement over ReLoaded, but still does not compare at all to the first one.<br />One of the problems with ReLoaded was that there were too many new characters.  The problem remains, as none of the new characters have any feeling to them.  You care about Neo, & Smith pretty much.  Even Morpheus, and Trinity to an extent, seem irrelevant in this chapter.  Everyone else...meaningless.  It is just one big faceless war.<br />The war for Zion is the only thing that saves this movie.  It is done rather well, and I give them credit for it.  But, without giving anything away, the way in which the war concludes is just a MAJOR letdown after all the buildup.  It basically makes anything the film did right seem pointless, and will simply anger you.<br />This is not a movie to see more than once.  Curiosity to see how it concludes if you have seen ReLoaded is the ONLY reason to watch this movie.  If you have only seen the first one, avoid the sequals at all cost.
B000089CKH|4.0|It's been a long and weird ride for the boys from Brooklyn.  &quot;Popular&quot; dropped them onto heavy rotation on MTV, creating a ready-made backlash that left them, ironically, somewhat unpopular.  In fact they couldn't even get their record company to release their second album.  Thankfully however it appears that they're getting the last laugh, as &quot;Let Go&quot; finished high on many critics end-of-year picks, and high/low is gaining recognition as the great lost indie rock album of the mid-nineties.<br />With &quot;Let Go&quot; however we find a more world-weary 'Surf, whose anger has been dulled by cynicism. I guess this is growing up, mind you, with the treatment they've had from the industry, a little cynicism is more than expected...<br />The band explore a new sound on this album, with mixed results.  Gone is the fuzzy guitar and experimentalism that made the first two albums so exciting, but in comes an added emotional depth to the songwriting and lyrics, a willingness to vent more personal issues than the rage and righteousness exemplified on their earlier albums.  This results in some of their best stuff ever - &quot;Blizzard of '77&quot; and &quot;La pour ca&quot;, which showcases their French roots, are definitely up there with their best material, however, a tendency for the band to overindulge in ballads is not as welcome.  As a case in point, &quot;Inside Of Love&quot; is absolutely terrible.  It sounds too much like modern period &quot;Travis&quot;, all gently strummed guitars and mawkishly overemotional lyrics.  Predictable chord changes and a rock-steady beat are all designed induce a lighter-raising frenzy, however they induce a &quot;Skip&quot; frenzy in this listener.  Nada Surf can do ballads - &quot;Blonde On Blonde&quot; and &quot;Killian's Red&quot; are amazing, but too many sub-par ballads* wear me out and make me long for the raging, scuzzed up Nada Surf of old.<br />This is a good album by modern standards, but i recommend you buy High/Low first...<br />*As a brief aside, sub-par is a golfing analogy, however sub-par in golf, means below average, meaning better than average, while sub-par in life seems to mean below average, meaning worse than average. How did the two get so confused? My head hurts.../Low first...<br />*As a brief aside, sub-par is a golfing analogy, however sub-par in golf, means below average, meaning better than average, while sub-par in life seems to mean below average, meaning worse than average.

0553278398|2.0|Although I am an Asimov fan, this book was disappointing.  As he explained, the sole purpose for this volume was to connect the dots in his previous Foundation series, but I am not sure why that was necessary and why it had to be so dry.<br />Much of the dialogues are contrived and contain Asimov's musings about food, society and state of the Galaxy thousands of years from now.  It is interesting that he projects the kind of social injustices and class struggles that dominated our political discourse during the cold war decades that far into the future.  This theme of challenge of maintaining social order is common in most of his works.  It would be so depressing if that were really the case for future civilizations that have supposedly solved so many of the fundamental problems of humanity.<br />The plot does have a few pleasant surprises, especially at the end and one also detects the innocent romanticism of Asimov throughout.  I do not think it is a must to read this book to enjoy the other books in the series; they were all very well done and memorable on their own.

B000002JPA|5.0|This is an amazing album that I cannot help but write a review for.  I admit that I am a rock fan.  However, I didn't normally listen to music as heavy as DT before I bought this album.  The music on this album is at once beautiful, poetic, amazingly complex, and exciting.  I especially love the lyrics and the moments on the album when the vocals match the instrumentals so perfectly! I have made my friends listen to selections from this album (mostly pop-infatuated friends) and they actually like what they hear! Although I have to admit the heaviness of the sound on this album may be a turnoff for an inexperienced listener (many of my friends found songs off Scenes from a Memory a much more enjoyable first listen), the reward for giving it a second, third, fourth, fifth...etc listen is off the charts.  Truly one of the best albums I have ever heard.  Hopefully any spelling/grammatical errors I have made won't detract from my point;)
B000066HI4|5.0|Sparse Instrumentation and hauntng melodies make up this release from Bonnie &quot;Prince&quot; Billy and they won't leave your head for days. From the  Bass and piano opening of Minor Place to the end its simply put a brilliant record. Full of gorgeous melodies and  simply beautiful string arrangments. The album does truly sound aged in a way that will let it always be a timeless record that will live on for years to come as an intelligent and inspiring piece of work. The tender intelligence that the lyrics portay is none the less amazing. I dont have to sit here and type why its good...just buy it and find out for yourself.
B00006LLNU|2.0|Remember those 3-D pictures at the mall that you'd have to stare at for about 15 minutes to really see the image.  I was that guy that would stare and never see it.  I feel the same way about this album.<br />Okay, first the pretenses.  An imaginary, gibberish of a language that they sing in?  The vocals that sound like a sick cat?  And these guys are dubbed 'the next Radiohead'???  Maybe some of you like the fact that it's new and different.  I do not.<br />I do like Sigur Ros's songs, one at a time.  But listening to () from start to finish is just plain unbearable.  Tracks 1-8 are indistinguishable.<br />I've heard all the theories of what &quot;()&quot; means and I've been told to think of the album as one-long song.  I think people that say this are starting to see things in that 3-D picture that aren't really there.<br />Sigur Ros do some things on this album that I think are imaginative and quite visionary.  They do create quite an atmosphere...one that becomes hard to listen after 4 tracks, but they do create an atmosphere.  I am curious to hear how this band evolves.  But I am tired of listening to this album and trying to find the genious in it that everyone else hears.<br />I don't care if Radiohead and DJ Z-Trip love this album, I just can't stand it, and I can't help but think that fans will listen to anything if it makes them feel elitest.
1400034779|5.0|Hardcore mystery fans who live for tightly plotted constructions sporting unexpected solutions may be disappointed in THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY--but what this episodic work lacks in such staple elements of the mystery genre it more than makes up for with character and setting and style.  The novel presents us with the episodic adventures of Mma Ramotswe, a large lady of Botswana brimming with commonsense and self-confidence who--with a little reliance on both Agatha Christie and a mail-order &#34;how to&#34; book--converts her beloved father's legacy into a detective agency and quickly makes a name for herself as one of the most astute investigators in the region.<br /><br />Written in a simple style that evokes African fable, the book is episodic in construction, offering several different tales from Mma Ramotswe's casebook--tales that emphasize the culture in which she moves and the thoughtways of her fellow citizens with remarkable elegance.  Whether it is tracing a missing husband, investigating a fraudulent insurance claim, or coping with a loathsome witchdoctor, Mma Ramotswe is clever, practical, and remarkably human, and the book has a gentle irony-laced humor that is almost certain to please.<br /><br />The character is easily one of the most memorable created for the mystery genre in a great many years and her presentation is nothing short of completely enjoyable; most readers will feel they'd like to fly to drop in for some of her bush tea and commonsense advice.  This is certainly a one-sitting read, the sort of book that you pick up intending to read only a chapter or two and then glance up to find that you've missed your dinner date.  Absolutely charming, strongly recommended, and I'm looking forward to reading more of Mme Ramotswe's adventures in the future!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Can anyone tell me, is the disc scratched on the top side on purpose?, is that the artwork?, well if it is, it sucks, and also the digipak case.<BR>the music is OK you get their hits not the fan favorites, only &quot;stranged&quot; missing. 4 stars for the music, 0 stars for the artwork.
0780631684|4.0|This was a very greusome, but awesome teen movie. I think the premise in and of itself was stupid, but the death scences and the plane crash were  brilliantly done. This movie scared me so much that I swore that I would never get on a plane. <BR>After the 2nd death, it became a bit more....absurd as time went on.  Come on, who really dies from pouring whiskey on a computer??? Who would be daft enough to do such a thing?? Or stand that close to a train??? But the gore and blood gave this movie a real edge. It scared me for three days!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album will perhaps be the greatest album to have dropped in 2004. Since it's still early, we can't make any predictions yet, but how is anyone gonna compete with this?<br />This cd is incredible, every track on here is awesome, the beats are awesome, and the lyrics are great as well. Altough Kanye may not be the best rapper, he definately has talent. His songs are unbelievably superior compared to other rappers' songs. The only person who has had a better album recently was Jay-Z's &quot;Black Album,&quot; and Kanye had part in producing it.<br />Every track is good, but here's my personal favorites:<br />We Don't Care (I just love this song)<br />All Falls Down (good beat)<br />Spaceship<br />Never Let Me Down (great collabo with Jay-Z, Jay'z verse is ill, this is my most favorite track)<br />Get 'em High (I wish Talib would have had more time to rap in this song, he's also got a lot of talent, same with Common)<br />School Spirit (catchy, humorous song)<br />Last Call (quite long, but very good)<br />I don't know who will be able to top this cd in 2004, because this is one of the greatest albums to have dropped.
0451205146|5.0|This is simply the best war novel I've ever read.  It grips you by the scruff of your shirt and doesn't let go.  It's not at all like a documentary, but all the details are there. You feel like as if you are in the heat of battle, you're scared, you've got a gun, and you shoot anything that moves.  You've seen your buds get hit and go down.  You want out.  It's really like you are in the heart of the combat, thinking all the wild thoughts the guys are thinking, and feeling lucky that you didn't have to go through the things they went through.
B00008US8R|4.0|Yah i like this CD...Amy Lee's voice is awesome! I would kill for a voice like hers.

You won't regret it!!!

B00003CXCT|3.0|Regarding the whole original versions vs special editions, I don't think anyone would argue that fixing \\"blue screen effects\\" would somehow detract from the cinema experience that compelled millions of people to pay money to see Star Wars over and over (thus giving it the place in cinema history it now has). Fixing a lightsaber glow here and there. Sure. Add a few more spaceships to the fleet. Hey, why not. It's \\"nifty new character and dialogue\\" ideas thought up by people apparently out of touch with reality (not to mention a colossal fan base) that take these films from \\"enhanced\\" to \\"sharp cheddar\\". You're watching your favorite movie, marveling at the improved color and sound quality, when all of the sudden it's like \\"what the crap??\\". Just as you recover from that one, there's another \\"what the crap??\\" moment. You know, that's what it is...too many \\"what the crap??\\" moments. Not enough, \\"oh cool, they fixed/added that\\" moments to make up for the \\"what the crap??\\" moments. <BR>I mean come on. Why can't George Lucas stand by his own work? You didn't see Kubrick going back to \\"fix\\" the 2001 late 60's special effects? Now we hear rumors of an \\"Ultimate\\" edition with even more \\"what the crap??\\" moments coming some time in the future. Lucas made a classic. Nobody is going to revoke that from him just because we don't get to see Jabba until Return of the Jedi. In fact, most of us liked it that way...<BR>But what does it matter? If there is one thing we can all be sure of it's that Lucas will do what he pleases...and I would guess that it would please him to have the original Star Wars trilogy (i.e. the reason people born in the 80's and 90's have heard of Star Wars) vanish from existence. In the words of the Emperor himself, \\"So be it.\\" <br />P.S. If we can't have the originals, can we at least have a \\"skip over the 'what the crap moments'\\" feature\\"?
0142004235|5.0|It's the classic of classics!  John Steinbeck is amazing at bringing all the characters and minor details together, weaving into one grand plot.

B00005JKWJ|4.0|&quot;Blade II&quot; is unique.  Consider first that it is based on an underappreciated and, up until the first movie, relatively unknown superhero outside of comic book stores.  Then consider that it's a sequel.  These are two things that just don't add up to success in the modern world.  You can make a clunker of a movie like &quot;Hulk&quot; and still get big numbers in the opening week based on the character's name alone.  You can also toss together a sequel(any of the &quot;Batman&quot; sequels)and gain solid numbers until word gets out that the movie is horrible.  Somehow &quot;Blade II&quot; takes both of these seemingly impossible odds, puts them together with a good plotline, slick action and solid direction, and comes up with a good movie that's ten times better than any other action sequel out there(excepting &quot;X-2&quot;).<br />Snipes is perfect as &quot;Blade.&quot;  He pulls it off with style, humor, and attitude.  Every move he makes is done in a &quot;superhero pose&quot; type of way.  He makes &quot;Blade&quot; both believable and impossible at the same time.  He's just flat out cool.  I know very little about this character except what I learned in the first movie.  I don't know if they got everything correct about the character, but I don't care because Snipes owns this character in the films.  Let the geeks iron out the inaccuracies.<br />&quot;Whistler,&quot; played by Kris Kristofferson, is his same old tough-as-nails, cranky self.  The &quot;Nomak&quot; character, by Luke Goss, is a perfect foil.  You almost feel sad for the guy since his pop screwed with his genetics like that.  His fight with &quot;Blade&quot; is one of the best brawls in modern comic-to-screen history.  It's over-the-top, a little fake-looking at times, but fits the tone of this movie to a tee.  The rest of the cast is superb as well, especially Ron Perlman, the perfectly annoying Scott Reedus and Danny John-Jules(of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;).<br />Don't let the naysayers fool you, this movie has a solid storyline to it. It may not be the romanticized version of a vampire most folks are used to these days, but it does give you a taste of the gory side of our bloodsucking brethren.  If the plot isn't your cup of tea, don't worry, because this movie has also got gene manipulation, ninja-vampires, the token nightclub brawl, cool gadgets that would make &quot;Batman&quot; giddy as a schoolgirl and even a love interest, albeit a brief one.<br />Director Guillermo Del Toro manages to make the &quot;Blade&quot; franchise his own with this sequel.  He keeps the dark, techno-music tone of the first flick intact, but puts his own mark on this flick as well via gore and stylized action.  Folks knock the sometimes-obvious CGI effects and &quot;Wrestlemania&quot; type fight sequences found throughout this movie, but that's what makes this movie so fun.  It's not too serious, it's fun and it's so stylish that you'll want to forgive the CGI miscues and over-the-top fight scenes.  This is an action movie folks, not &quot;Pride and Prejudice!&quot;<br />In closing, watch this slick flick for the fun, action-packed romp that it is.  &quot;Lestat&quot; he ain't, but &quot;Blade&quot; could take that punk out anytime, anywhere.ool you, this movie has a solid storyline to it.

0802130208|1.0|This book was one of the worst books I have read reciently.  The book could have been two sentences...There is a fat guy who suffers from dillustions of grandure.  Go read Don Quito if you want a funny version of this story... An all around bad book with only one plot device, and a main character that I could neithor love nor hate because he was a completely flat character.  It is a good thing that this author only wrote one book because this way less people will waste money on his flat characters in his boring stories.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|This cd is not up to Godsmack standards. It's good, just not what they've pulled off in the past. First off, drummer Tommy Stewart (drummer on their self-titled, and Awake) left the band just before they began this cd. New drummer Shannon Larkin is good, but no Tommy. The usual Godsmack sound of everything meshing together is almost gone. They focus now on guitars, and bass. It's good for the song they do, but compared to previous Godsmack stuff it almost sounds lazy.<br />Straight Out of Line ~ 10/10-This starts like &quot;one&quot; by Metallica. Starts with drums, and then build to a powerful intro, and song.<BR>Faceless ~ 9/10-This one took me a while to like but now, I love it<BR>Changes ~ 8/10-Again, took a while for me to like<BR>Make Me Believe ~ 10/10-This song is one of the best here. The guitars on this song are incredible.<BR>I Stand Alone ~ 9/10-The single from The Scorpion King in all it's glory<BR>Re-Align ~ 10/10-This is a great song. Perfectly done<BR>I F***** Hate You ~ 10/10-This is a great song. I was surprised by that fact. Listen to the lyrics and you'll understand why<BR>Releasing the Demons ~ 9/10-This is another great song.<BR>Dead and Broken ~ 10/10-Again, you have to listen to it some before you'll like it<BR>I Am ~ 8/10-A good song in it's own way. It grows on you.<BR>Awakening ~ 5/10-The intro to the final song....<BR>Serenity ~ 10/10-The final song is acoustic. But it's probably the best song on this cd.<br />I love Godsmack and their other work. I got this cd and it took me a long time to find the true essence of this cd. I hope they never stop rocking
B00005B36H|5.0|wow, some people. i guess some people dont have the mind power to understand complex progressive intelegent music. people bashing certian songs and such. this is an ALBUM people, all songs have similar meaning and flow into another. this album is by far there best one yet, in my eyes they get better and better with each and i cant wait to hear the next one. now on the sound, it is a well written album (by sub mainstream standards), and for a hard rock or progressive metal album, wichever you want to call it, is very well recorded. danney carrey seems to be matureing on the art of preccusion, the cymbal work on this album is phenominal. everyone seems to be all about the bass these days, so its a breath of fresh air so to speak. not to mention the odd time signatures, a trademark of all progressive music. the only modern band that comes close, and admitadly is better, is dream theater.
0156027321|4.0|I am student from a small private school in the middle of a small town. Our World Literature teacher assigned our the for reading.  When I first started this book I thought it was going to be another school book, the boring type.  Well as i go t more into the book it got better and better. I soon became in gulfed in this boy's life, more so then i thought i would. The book tells a trully inspiring story of a struggle between life and death.  I recomend this book to all, no matter what age. I warn those weak in the stomach, that this may not be your kind of book. I hope you enjoy the book as much as i did.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|This cd is far from schlock, it is hotter than lukewarm, and not tepid.  It not not sure genius either, but it is worth the money and worth a listen, and I for one thought it was quite good.  I am thinking that a few of the previous reviewers were expecting EC to sit in a hotel room and play an acoustic guitar and do exact covers of the works of Robert Johnson.  I think it has a bit of a Chicago feel actually, kind of like if Muddy Waters had done the same thing.  I don't care for the way it was produced, and I wish that EC would have used someone else to collaborate with on the production. It has many great moments regardless of this fact. If you look at EC's previous career of covers of Robert Johnson, they are not faithful to the original either, and some of them are now considered classics (ie live Crossroads on Cream's Wheels of Fire) some others from his C&W influenced era have a completely different feel.  When is artistic reinterpretation of another artists work a crime?  Maybe it isn't as poignant as what Johnny Cash did with the work of well, everybody, but it is worth discovering.  A lot of people may listen to this and never have heard much about Robert Johnson before and may want to find out more.  Probably one of EC's quests in the first place. He was always one for nodding his head and giving credit where credit was due.  Heck to be honest, the whole reason I personally got into Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf, Mississippi John Hurt, B.B. King, Albert King (man I am glad I found out about him!) Freddie King, Buddy Guy, and a lot of other fantastic people was stemmed from listening to the music of Eric Clapton. If you don't like it, give your copy to a person who never heard the blues before, they might get hooked too.  I went and pulled out the 2 vol of Robert Johnson lps I have had to go out and buy them after hearing Four until Late on Fresh Cream. The Rolling Stones covered RJ and never even gave the man credit. Jerry Portnoy and Billy Preston are fantastic throughout.
B00006CXSS|5.0|WoW , Thats what i said after watching each and every episode of this harrowing insite into the lives of Easy company throughout their WW2 experiences.<BR>Well made and acted, it doesnt play like a TV mini-series but more like a 10 hr movie Blockbuster.<br />If u loved &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; Bye this .....its like 10hrs of that.<BR>Must have for your war collection
B00007CVSH|5.0|After almost falling asleep with the Met's production of Il Trovatore (despite some great singing), I was very pleased with this production. The singing is very good, specially Hovorostovsky's Count di Luna. The only somewhat weak singing came in my opinion from Villaroel's Leonora, who is not the right type of soprano for the role, and cannot cope well with Verdi's difficult score. However, her singing is very emotional, as is the case with the rest of the cast. The sets, even though transported to the nineteenth century, are wonderful (specially compared to the Met's nonexistent and boring sets) as are the costumes. In fact I find the period change to be a welcome change to the traditional staging. As other reviewers have mentioned, it gives the production a film-like feel.<br />Rizzi's direction is very exciting and the 5.1 DD sound is very very good. Special praise to the chorus! Far more exciting than the Met's, this production is highly recommended!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I'm going to be honest. The first time I saw Kill Bill I thought it was a good movie but I didn't understand what the big fuss was about. After my second viewing I realized how dazzling and inovative the movie really is. The movie still has some vises that I can't get over. I found that the acting a little lackluster and that Vivica fox's character wasn't devolped at all. I'm sure we are going to see more of the history in Vol. 2 and things will become clearer. With that aside, the cinematography was vivid with color, The action was superb, and the plot was a great ode to the spegitti westerns of old. This is a must see for fans of Quentin's or of action flicks in general. Easly one of if not the best movie of the year.
0156027321|5.0|As a Muslim I know my religion and a lot of Christianity too and I found the writer has gone to a great lenght to ensure the accuracy of the facts about Islam and Christianity. <BR>It's hard actual to have some inter-faith talk like Pi encountered and I found it refreshing to read about what I as a Muslim perceive other religions and people from other faith perceive mine.<BR>In Malaysia,faith and religion are very sensitive issue. We rarely talk about them openly thus preventing us from knowing and understanding each other. Life of Pi has deepened my belief and understanding
B00000GAIW|5.0|I've just been introduced to Jethro Tull. I love many late 60's and early-late 70s bands, but I never realized that Jethro Tull was this good. At this point, I've heard Aqualung and Passion Play. Both are wonderful, but for different reasons. <br />Aqualung plays almost like a storybook for older people. It takes place in mideval England under the rule of the Church. This story is one about a man named Aqualung and his problems and observations. It is truly great.<br />The lyrics alone are magnificent because they are intelligent, witty, and serious all at the same time. The lyrics, when I first listened to the album, helped me see how great the music is. <br />I'll rate the songs for you:<br />PART I: AQUALUNG<br />Aqualung: 10/10. This is the first song I ever heard by Tull. Oh, and if you're one of those people like me who likes the electric guitar, one of the best solos I have ever heard is on this song. It could be the best song on the album.<br />Cross-Eyed Mary: 8/10. Another very good song, but there are better on the album. This one is more dark.<br />Cheap Day Return: 9/10. A bit of a break from more rock-oriented songs. Cheap Day Return is acoustic and it's quite good.<br />Mother Goose 10/10. I bet you weren't expecting a song of this nature on such a serious album. Don't worry. You will love this one. It's uppity and a bit witty. Ian Anderson is a genius.<br />Wond'ring Aloud 9/10. Another very good song [imagine that]that starts of a bit sad, but becomes a good acoustic peice.<br />Up to Me 9/10. If you liked the title track and Cross-Eyed Mary, this will be one of your favorites, too. It's a very good rock song that quickly gets your attention. I'm sure everyone will like this one. The only reason I didn't give it a ten is because its the only song on the album I haven't listened to from start to finish.<br />PART II: MY GOD<br />My God 10/10. Fantastic song. Makes you feel for Aqualung. Electric guitar doesn't start for a while, but it's in there.<br/>Hymn 43 8/10. I am not familiar with this hymn because I don't go to church, but this version is pretty good.<br />Slipstream 7/10. Not much to say about this one except that it's not bad -- there are much better songs within the album.<br />Wind Up 10/10. I LOVE THIS SONG. Wind Up is pretty much the conclusion to the album and it is FANTASTIC. Aqualung talks again a bit about his childhood and how he wants to stick it to everyone in his Sunday school who was mean to him or just tried to make religion his life. This song is VERY good. The beginning is slow, but it becomes a little roller coaster after that.<br />TOTAL : 90/110. yeah.<br />This is a really cool story that's a bit sad, but you side with the underdog. You need to listen to the entire thing in onw day. Hopefully, all the way through. <br />The extra tracks are good, but they really just threw them onto Aqualung to make more money -- they aren't required to listen to Aqualung.<br />The only bad thing about this album is the \\"remaster.\\" Thay tried WAY too hard to make it sound perfect. As I've said before, records are much better than cds. I first heard this on record and was a bit disappointed with the cd version -- the music isn't quite as clear. Also, I think thay sped the tracks up by a tiny bit. It's certainly good enough, though. They did that on Layla which royally pissed me off. <br />Anyway, this is a classic which any music fan, period, should own. Trust me -- I listen to everything from Frank Zappa to Pink Floyd to Richie Havens to Jorma Kaukonen to the Beatles to the Who.
0393057658|4.0|Michael Lewis writes another deceptively simple book, telling a simple story in a compelling manor and confirming the strategy behind the Oakland A's success.  The book is an easy read and never gets as complicated or complex as baseball can get at times.  An interesting read from page 1.   <br />This book pretty much turns baseball upside down, exposing the traditions of baseball for what they are, ignorant sheep-like mentality.  That is, people doing something because someone else does it.  Amazing it has taken this long for the foolishness to be exposed.  But that's baseball as they say<br />I can't imagine the main character in the book Billy Beane is very popular these days.  For the most part, he has made his peer set look ridiculous, which is, everybody involved in running a baseball team.  But our national pastime has always required a healthy sense of humor, when you consider what the fans are forced to put up with; ticket prices, player strikes, off field antics, owners in the limelight, etc.  The list goes on and hopefully Beane has started something that will fundamentally improve, perhaps save the game.  <br />You don't have to know baseball to enjoy this book, but it does help.  An understanding of statistics and the value of money are just as important, and if you read this as a business book, MoneyBall is incredibly thought proving and probably applicable to most any business.  <BR>md<BR>Michael Duranko<BR>[...]
0385504209|2.0|This book is overrated.  The characterizations are inconsistent and the plot is simplistic.  Dan Brown is unable to develop any coherent ideas of his own.  I wouldn't recommend reading it.
B00005IC2H|2.0|I tried hard to love this album, but frankly, I couldn't.  Sure, the music was beautiful, but I simply could NOT understand a word the singer sang.  I even recorded it onto my computer and tried to play it backwards.  No luck.  I'm someone who loves lyrics, words, and the message they give us.  How good a song would &quot;I Love Candy&quot; be without words?  Or &quot;Too Shy&quot;?  Exactly.  <br />Needless to say, until the singer learns to annunciate, I'll be looking elsewhere.
B000089RVX|1.0|...in other words total rubbish. Giving this album 1 star is being excedingly generous. Ok, Amy Lee can sing but that's as far as my compliments are going. This &quot;band&quot; are no more than &quot;grown up&quot; pop music for children. For those of you who are thinking &quot;hey look, how cool am I, I'm a goth now because I like Evanescence!&quot; are just fooling yourselves. The purpose of this &quot;band&quot; was to trick the average pop junkie into thinking they were goth. <BR>The music is simple, the lyrics are simple, so all in all this leads to a very simple boring CD. <BR>If you want real goth music check out The 69 Eyes, Tristania etc. Or if you are just looking for something slightly different from the watered down boring pop that is constantly doing the rounds on the charts take a listen to Lacuna Coil, these Italians know what they're doing, but whatever you do don't download/buy/steal &quot;Fallen&quot; - you be wasting your time/money.
B000063DS1|2.0|I bought this set with hope and excitement, knowing that not only was I hearing a great band exit on top, but also a great singer and songwriter in his prime.  And what does he get?  That's right, one song.  That's right - I'm talking about Neil Diamond.  It seems a bit of a waste to invite the man and hardly use him.  After all, how much did the Band liberally borrow from Mr. Diamond?  I don't think I'm a fool for suggesting that &quot;The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show&quot; owes more than a little to &quot;Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show&quot;.  <br />Until Rhino sees fit to include more Neil (and I don't mean Young), I won't be buying this.  I don't care if he only played one song at the concert, add a practice take or something.<br />One final thought: it was the Seventies -where were Bread?  Curious.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|The Diary of Alicia Keys is by far one of the best CDs this year, if not this decade.  You would think there would be only a couple good songs like the last CD (I only liked a few on that one), but each one was great.  One after another could easily be a number one hit.  However, the best song by far is &quot;If I Aint Got U&quot; It is my favorite song now, and has been ever since the day the CD was released...it probably will be for a looonnggg time.  Once you listen to the song you'll see- you won't be able to stop listening to it. When the song hit #1 on 106nPark it felt like I won because I have loved that song for so long and finally other people realized how amazing it is. If you don't already have the CD, you really need to get it because you are missing out on one of the greatest R&amp;B CDs of ALL TIME. no joke.
0805209999|5.0|This novel isn't just Kafka's best...it's the best novel of the 20th Century.<br />&quot;The Trial&quot; takes a surreal premise and drops it in a context so complete (the bizarre details alone make &quot;The Trial&quot; worth reading) that the story feels completely realistic.  Picture &quot;1984&quot; with a neurotic streak.<br />Anyway, read it and prepare to remember it for the rest of your life.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  It is always a pleasure to experience a movie with a happy ending.  It was wonderful just to sit back and watch two of the best actors of their generation do their thing.  It was also wonderful to watch those \\"great faces\\" with all the lines and wrinkles, but also so full of life and expression and untimately beauty, especially Diane Keaton.  While I enjoyed the commentary by the director and Diane, I found Jack offensive.  His crack about the \\"large\\" reason the director had to cut away after Amanda/Marin gets off him at the beginning of the movie was disgusting.  It just made him seem like the old letch he plays in this movie.  The commentary however, is not necessary to enjoying the movie.
B000000P17|3.0|No, &quot;TSI&quot; isn't a great album, or even a great stopgap album (what it's a stopgap FOR is anyone's guess at this point).<br />Still, it doesn't deserve to be a punchline.  In their quest to &quot;punk it up,&quot; GNR mistakenly picked a list of songs without much range; hurting the work as a whole.  It also doesn't sound like they were very INSPIRED by some of the tunes (Raw Power and I Don't Care About You especially), the results being flat cover versions.<br />Nonetheless, when you have a gang of supremely talented musicians in the studio, good things are bound to happen.  &quot;Ain't It Fun&quot; is great, as is Down On the Farm (originally slated to appear on one of the Illusion records).  I can also listen to YCPYAAAM, Hair of the Dog, Attitude, and the Manson jingle.  <br />Bottom-line: &quot;Spaghetti&quot; isn't memorable or even Guns-worthy, but it shouldn't evoke laughter either.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Miss Halle portrays a prison psychiatrist, Charles S. Dutton her boss, husband & love of her life, Robert Downey, Jr. as her peer/collegue, & Penelope Cruz as an inmate/patient with some schizophrenic delusions of the devil, himself, burning/entering her body.<br />As it starts - It was a dark & stormy night...<br />From there things get really creepy & all mixed up.  What is true?  What is imagined? Who is crazy? Who is not? A dead girl, a tatooed man, an invisible being, blood written messages on a wall, an axe...Lots of really graphic images PLUS totally spooky lighting all add to the experience.<br />This film has you trying to figure out the plot from the get go & has many \\"red herrings\\"... Once the plot is alluded to, however, the film starts to unravel faster and faster to it's eventual, but not totally predictable end.<br />The only thing that I couldn't figure out is why they titled this movie, GOTHIKA.  It is only said a total of ONE time in the whole of the film.<br />Regardless, this movie has plenty of punch, a couple of jumpy parts, some sado-masochism and at the end it is actually left open for a possible sequel, which I wouldn't mind seeing...<br />If you liked Stir Of Echoes, The Sixth Sense, or The Others, you will certainly enjoy this gem!  Happy Watching!
B0001HAHXW|4.0|I can't believe one poster said EC has no soul.  His licks are mechanical?  The guy created so much for the electric guitar.  Van Halen and numerous other people hung onto every lick EC has ever done.  The guy is top 5 greatest electric blues/rock guitarist ever! End of discussion.  <br />This record is not as good as From the Cradle, partially because its lacking any songs with his &quot;fire in the belly&quot; playing which makes EC so much different from any other blues guitarist.  Few guitarist(a handful) can take a blues solo and create something new and exciting.  EC doesn't reach for that on this record, instead going for the middleground and a more polished but old-time blues sound.  Obviously, there are plenty of instruments on each song so its not going to sound like the original Robert Johnson tunes.  EC has created something new, which is what all great artists of his caliber are known for.  The guy is a living legend when it comes to guitar.  Anything he does is better then most of those blues imitators who just play licks.  EC will always bring it his way, because he has been doing it for 30 years.<br />Think of this record as From the Cradle, but without EC's wailing guitar in the forefront.  He chose to let the band speak on these songs, and this is a testament to his unselfishness.  The truth is EC has nothing left to prove.  He has done so much musically, that whatever he puts out is joy for me.  I am slightly dissapointed because I wanted the intense and beautiful guitar solos, but I love EC's style and musicianship.  You can't expect the guy to be hammering out Cream guitar solos now. The moral of the story is guitar heros are getting old. ZZ top doesnt play with the same fire anymore. Clapton is one of the few guys who can still lay into a song when necessary, but when he does now, it means more, because you aren't going to hear it as much.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Billy Joel inspired my about 4 years ago at a young age of 17. My physics teacher would put him on during class and after a short time of listening I came to realize that Billy Joel is great. It is stereotypical to say that Billy Joel is not for the younger generation but anyone, no matter what age, who has an appreciation for good music would love Billy Joel. I am just about to turn 22 and graduate from college and Billy Joel is still cranked in my car and junky little apartment.
0156027321|5.0|As a reader of The life of Pi and a student attending LaLumiere, a private school in the North-West, I found this book to be very exciting in content and very detailed in story. This is my most favorite novel that I have ever read because it describes the life of Pi, a young boy who grows up trying to find himself in a world full of numerous religions. He explores several different religions and then combines them all into his beliefs to make up his own. Once he finds himself, his stamina, religion, and spirituality are put to the test when he becomes stranded out in the middle of the ocean with four animals, while his family and others are laid to rest upon the ocean floor with the sunken ship. One by one, each animal gets killed off by another until there is only Pi and Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger, left on the life raft. I cannot spoil the story about who dies next in the story, for you will have to read it yourself. Trust me, it is really a worthwhile experience to read through this book. And who knows? You may even find your own spiritual self within this novel.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I am a 29 year old lifelong Star Wars fan.  I consider the original films to be as much a part of my personality as the lessons I learned in school or the values I learned from my parents. I cannot conceive of myself or my consciousness apart from the influence of the FIRST trilogy.  I've seen them all coutless times, quote lines appropriate to any situation, and I still will drop everything else to watch them when they show up on TV.  So needless to say, I was completely thrilled to see them in the theatres back in the 90s.  I even tolerated the SE changes, just so long as I could still obtain copies of the originals.  How sad I am to hear that the DVD editions, my chance to own these films in a permanent format that I can share with my children and grandchildren, will only be available in the SE versions.  How wrong, corrupt, and thoroughly inhuman. Now...here's why.  It has been said that the SE versions represent the fulfillment of \\"the artist's definitive vision\\" and that Lucas, as the artist, has every right to complete the vision he wanted to but didn't have the budget or technology to do so 1977-83. Thus case closed, apparently.  Well, not so.  I for one take a different view of art.  I think that when great art is released into the public arena, and goes on to prove itself so influential that it becomes a sort of cultural signpost, its form in fact transcends the \\"artist's vision\\" and becomes a kind of common property, part of our collective consciousness, and part of us all.  To then permanently change it decades later is to do a kind of violence to us all. So, for instance, take \\"remastering\\", a common technological alteration to lots of classic records.  This can be a good thing. The Beatles records (an appropriate cultural analogy, I think) have all been remastered for CD. They sound better, enhance the nuances of the music, and take little, if anything away.  Remastering does not substantially change the art, which I why I can accept some doctored up special effects, and maybe some \\"restored footage\\" here or there in the Star Wars films.  But THIS, this travesty, this attempt to permanently eliminate the original versions in favor of the sanitized, kid-friendly, \\"definitive\\" versions....well, that would be like Paul re-releasing all the Beatles albums in 2004, with new vocals and overdubs added, dropping some of the offensive songs, calling them the \\"definitive\\" versions, and making the originals unavailable.  Would he have that right?  Or does that art belong to all of us? I would call that just what I call THIS: a crime, corrupt and inhuman.  Thanks but no thanks, George.
0671027387|4.0|After reading the DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, which I found very good, I had to read Dan Brown's two other offerings.  Deception Point was well written with a great deal of action and suspense.  I am still wondering, though, how Dan was going to land the plane at Bolling Air Force Base.  Bolling has no runway.  A minor error in what was a fun book to read.
B00005JM02|4.0|Just a quick review to highlight the good and bad. Number one the animation.<BR> Wow!!! I was drawn into a magical world under the sea! Truly spectacular animation!!! In some ways the water and physics of water behave more &quot;lifelike&quot; than real water!!! Astounding, although anyone who is an avid PC gamer would have seen the extent of water effects in 3-D animation by now. Second, the voice acting. Some great performances, some instantly recognisable such as Albert Brooks or Geoffrey Rush. And the jokes are generally  not crass or rude, in some instances however only adults will &quot;get it&quot;!!! but it's always safe for the kids. <BR>The audio is great with a deep full bass and dynamic audio utilization through all ranges. The video quality is also great with sharp and distinct colours and contrasts. &quot;Reds&quot; look paritculary good. The one complaint I have is with the &quot;blues&quot; of Dory, Ellen DeGeneres. It seems that they are so bright that they are not defined as a result.She seems to be blending into whatever ocean environment she finds  herself.<BR>The characters that Marlin meets are for the most part interesting. My favourites are however the three sharks led by Bruce, a Great White with a wonderful Aussie accent, who is the leader of a self-help group promoting goodwill between fish and sharks. &quot;Remember, fish are friends, not food!&quot; the groups motto is recited at every meeting!!! I suppose i would have prefered it if they has spent more time with Bruce and his companions or possibly spent more time at the &quot;paaaahty&quot;. <BR>All in all, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a fun adventure, (2nd on my list after Monsters Inc), and should delight all children. A friend of mine's son has seen it at least 30 times in the last month, so I suppose he would be the best critic and his opinion the most prudent.
B0000CEB62|5.0|okay first off, i didnt buy this for the concert, i bought it for the commentary, it is someof the best commentary i have ever heard, its basically depeche mode reminicing about the old days, and you get to take a ride with them...and hope the never let you down again, which in fact they dont, super job!

Mota - 12/10 my favorite. hilarious, with good meaning, and fast song.<BR>4. Me And my Old Lady - 11/10 an outstanding song. i didn't like it from the beginning but later on i liked the arabic melody elements put into it.<BR>5. Cool To Hate - 12/10 my favorite fast song of theirs. it is fast brutal and just an awesome song over all<BR>6. Leave it Behind - 10/10 just nice. no comments.<BR>7. Gone Away - 9/10 a good song but it sets the album off track with its tempo.<BR>8. I Choose - 9/10 a good pop punk song.<BR>9. Intermission - 10/10 gives you kind of good rest from all of the bambam!!! on the album<BR>10.All I Want - 10/10 a good fast teen anthem about life. nice lyrics<BR>11.Way Down The Line - 11/10 an awesome song. good lyrics, just hilarious as always.<BR>12.Don't pick It Up - 11/10 a funny ska song. I don't remember offspring having even one bad ska song. very successful.<BR>13.Amazed - 9/10 nahh. slow again sets the thing off track.<BR>14.Change the World - 10/10 an awesome final song. impressive. especially funny is the hidden track when dexter says &quot;you guys have to try heavy metal. kiss my ass!&quot;<br />an incredible album overall. the best they've done
0345404475|1.0|I should preface this review by saying that I'm a huge fan of PKD, or atleast his short fiction.  I rank him as possibly the greatest short SF writer ever.  However, his novels stink to high holy hell.<br />The book reads like 3 or 4 short stories that have somehoe been slammed together and fused into some unholy spawn of the underworld that contains almost nothing resembling a coherent story.  There's obviously supposed to be a deeper question brought up by this book of &quot;What it means to be alive&quot;, but it's horribly executed.  The characters are often placed in unlikely situations and their reactions make little sense.  The plot twists double back on themselves far too quickly for someone to actually follow.  Often times the location and surroundings randonly change in the middle of a paragraph with little to no warning.  Even the final &quot;religious revelation&quot; of the main character seems trite and cliche.  <br />There are themes of religion vs mass media, artificial vs natural life and even good vs evil, but none of these are drawn out to anything resembling a conclusion.  Some of them never get past the set up stage.<br />Overall I was incredibly disappointed in this book and would recommend against it.
B000092Q4U|5.0|LAMB OF GOD returns with their new and second creation, but with a little change in their style. Now they mix brutal metal with some melodic influence in the music. They have done the job outstandingly! With an exception of just a couple of tracks that i dont consider outstanding this album is perfect. buy this cd if you like people like god forbid, as i lay dying and so on. buy it NOW!!!
B000060P79|1.0|Ok. Let me tell you something. I am not punk. I dont claim to be punk. but once this is for sure. This CD does not even come close to punk. These songs are aimed at kids? I'm 12 and I know a sellout when I see it. This band has nothing behind their corporate masks. You want punk? do NOT look to blink 182, sum 41, simple plan, good charlotte or NOFX to get it. if you want real punk with substance, look to The Stooges, Ramones, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag or, if your a moderner look to The Distillers or The Lot Six. These bands are real. Simple Plan has nothing. trust me. Unless your a kid whose selling yourself out big time, or an adult who already has, steer clear of this sh**t.
B00018D44U|2.0|This is pretty ordinary girl singer stuff.  I think the answer is she has a very beautiful voice but it needs great music to rise above the other ordinarily beautiful voices.  The music itself is very pedestrian
0553573411|5.0|Book 2 of the Farseer Trilogy<br />This second entry in Robin Hobb's \\"Farseer\\" trilogy picks up where the first book let off.  FitzChivalry was poisoned by Prince Regal when he was in the Mountain Kingdom to bring home Princess Kettricken.  Kettricken is to wed Fitz's master, King-in-Waiting Verity.  Fitz is battered, both emotionally and physically and it is a long time before he is able to return to Buckkeep and rejoin the royal court.  When Fitz returns to Buckkeep he steps back into his old role as King Shrewd's Assassin, as well as into a new role as Verity's helper in fighting the Forged Ones.  The Forged Ones are citizens of the Kingdom of the Six Duchies who have been captured by the Red Ship Raiders (who have been terrorizing the coast) and turned loose as near zombies who can't think or feel but know only to attack and feed like ghouls.<br />The King is sick.  He is losing strength and Verity's younger brother is plotting both against the King as well as against Verity.  Fitz is doing what he can to protect Verity, but there isn't much that he can do since Regal is a legitimate son and Fitz is only the illegitimate child of a dead Farseer.  Any action Fitz may take can be construed as treason, and he must be careful as Regal already hates him.  In the midst of the plotting and intrigue there is some romance.  Fitz is still in love with a street girl he knew years earlier named Molly.  Molly is now working at the castle as a maid for Princess Patience, and though Fitz knows that this relationship can be used against him by his enemies, he cannot stay away from Molly (once known as Molly Nosebleed).<br />This is a fairly long and deep fantasy novel, but the world that Robin Hobb has created feels real.  Hobb's world is brutal and our favorite characters are spared no pain.  Reading this, I never really knew which characters would live and which would die, even Fitz (you really don't believe he'll die, but Hobb did such a good job with this world that I felt the threat was real).  There is not a lot of action, but when it happens it explodes with huge implications.  In my view, this is some good fantasy.  I'm already looking forward to book 3 \\"Assassin's Quest\\".elt the threat was real).  There is not a lot of action, but when it happens it explodes with huge implications.  In my view, this is some good fantasy.  I'm already looking forward to book 3 \\"Assassin's Quest\\".

B00003CXCT|1.0|I just finished viewing the final release to these new special edition DVD and I gotta say that this is George Lucas' vanity run amuck!!!  the following are new scenes in the new special edition.<br />1.  Bigg's X-wing fighter being digitally replaced with the Starship Enterprise in the battle to destroy the first death star.<br />2. The Ewoks now seem to be intelligent and have major speaking rolls.<br />3. Jar Jar Binks now is in the trilogy as the leader of the rebel forces.  (Grand General Binks)<br />4. Gabe Kaplan has replaced Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian<br />5. Leia now has a hook hand and is played by Roseanne Barr.<br />6. Boba Fett has a 15 minute flash back about wanting to be in a show tune and Jango forbidding it.<br />7. The Death Star in Return of the Jedi looked more like a Borg cube.<br />8. Triumph the Insult Talking dog has a brief cameo.<br />9. Mark Hammill wardrobe has been replace with frilly pink lace and alot of silk.<br />10. Jabba the Hut's breakdance number.  WTF!?(...)<br />11. Darth Vader's shocking announcement that Luke was adopted by him and his \\"soul mate.\\"<br />As you can see, these changes were made to get more \\"normal\\" people to wanna see it, but I say, to hell with normal people, I am a star wars nerd and I want things to remain the same for ever and ever and ever and ever (except for the \\"not meeting girls\\" thing).  If Lucas wants to change the movies, let him do it in a galaxy far far away...
B00015YVD6|5.0|The DVD extras really make this 20th anniversary re-release worth owning.  This movie has been run repeatedly (in edited form) on television, so there probably aren't that many people who haven't had a chance to see this delightful fantasy.  The &quot;making-of&quot; video and the commentary track give a fascinating glimpse into the way that Hollywood works.  Why did Disney wind up making this film?  How did Tom Hanks get the lead?  How did they choose Darryl Hannah?  Who was the film's &quot;real&quot; star?  How did they pull off the underwater shots?  What was the lobster that Madison ate in the restaurant?  If you have a soft spot for this film, it's a joy to watch and a real treat to get to know better.
B0000027RL|5.0|Nirvana - Great band<BR>Pearl Jam - great band<br />Both bands were/are exceptional on what they did/do! It seems like some Nirvana fans have a hard time dealing with the fact that pearl jam actually was bigger! If Eddie committed the suicide instead of Kurt, then Eddie would be a bigger icon in Rock history today than what Kurt is. Deal with it!!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Ok look.  Im gonna cut straight to the chase ok, Im not gonna go into all of this crap on why it is or isnt good because of 1 boched second of the film ok.  Look!  Donnie Darko is a great movie and deserves a ton of credit.  Richard Kelly is 26 and this is his first film.  it's also the first film iv'e seen that accually made me think when it was over.  All of the depth he put into this masterpiece took so much time and effort it's mind boggling.  Im not gonna say, &quot;Hey it's his first movie, go see it to cut him some slack.&quot; Im saying go see it because it will blow your mind.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I saw Big Fish in theaters, and as a picky movie-goer, I was suprised how much I loved it!  The best word I can think to describe this movie is magical!  I really did love it.  All of the actors have incredible performances and I highly suggest seeing Big Fish ASAP.  I also loved how this movie could be for teenagers (like myself), my parents, and my grandparents!  I loved this movie so much I bought the soundtrack and book (I enjoyed both)
0441003257|5.0|Who would have thought that the Apocalypse could be so funny and filled with such happenstance and errors!!! This book is very well written and incredibly funny. Also has one of my all time favorite lines... &quot;all tapes left in a car for more than about a fortnight metamorphose into _Best of Queen_ albums&quot;.<br />If you like this I would also recomend Neil Gaiman's _American Gods_.
B0000DZTIW|4.0|Hans Zimmer has been doing a lot of colaborations with up and coming composers.  Harry-Gregson-Williams, John Powell, Nick Glennie Smith, Jeff Rona and others.  Sometimes not even taking front credits.  White Squall, Pirates of the Carribean for examples. Unless you look in the liner notes you'd never know he had anything to do with these scores.  I think his best work is when he goes solo and Samurai is a perfect example. This score stands alone very well and is his best work since the lion king.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|Guns N' Roses could have ruled the world. In 1988 they were the coolest rock band ever, but then Axl decided to kill their career and dissapoint millions of loyal fans with the bloated excess of Use Your Illusion I and II.  If you want a Guns N Roses cd in your collection, simply buy Appetite for Destruction and enjoy it. You can hear a young hungry band on that album, and it's the only Guns N Roses album that really mattered as far as an impact on music and pop culture. So, I cannot recommend this Greatest Hits cd.
B00005OCMR|2.0|I am a bit of a geek and I like geek movies.  You know the ones nobody ever goes to see but get great DVD treatment? <br />The big problem with this movie is that it's just plain silly.  When Jeff Bridges starts shouting about evidence being hidden in one of &quot;these memories&quot; or later when someone shouts about a &quot;null unit&quot; you know the people who made this movie did not know much about computers.  Ironic since this is often thought to be a &quot;computer&quot; movie.<br />The idea is a good one but the movie fails in the telling.  The movie is notable for the first use of what has now become the ever present CG in movies.  Sure it's primitive but the effects are still quite nice to look at.  They do not hold up to anything in movies today by any stretch.  In fact any home video game could do the effects in this movie and the entire soundtrack with no problems.   <br />So other than it's effects, what kind of movie do you have?  Not much of one.  The story is just stupid.  For a Disney movie, this film will not appeal to kids.  I am still after all these years trying to figure out who the audience for this film is.<br />I think this movie was made in desperation by Disney to cash in on the whole video game boom of the early 80's.  <br />The one thing I do like after all these years is the sound the recognizers make.  Now that is a cool sound.<br />The DVD is packed with a lot of extras.  A lot more than I cared to watch to be honest.  The commentaries are good but very technical and they can get a little dry at times.  <br />I do wish more studios would do this with other movies.  The extras are wasted on such a bad movie to be honest.  This is a fans dream but I have yet to meet a Tron fan.
B000002KIE|5.0|Ahh yes the sex pistols. The early years of punk of which I call them the golden years. The sex pistols are one of the inovaters of punk music. If you are a punker, and don't know about the sex pistols, your what we call a poser. A true punker would definitley know about the pistols. The pistols hailed Paul Cook, Steve Jones, Johny Rotten, and of course, the legend \\"Sid Vicious\\". These guys hail from England, so of course they may seem a little weird. Anarchy in the U.K. and God Save the Queen are the best songs in this cd. You could heir Anarchy in the U.K. in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4. If you want to get into the sex pistols I suggest you get this cd and the book \\"Englands Dreaming, Anarchy, Sex Pistols ,Punk Rock, and Beyond\\" by Jon Savage. That book is very long (632 pages)so if your too lazy to read just get this cd. Its an awesome punk cd!
B00005JN1L|3.0|Being a Johnny Depp fan, I had to see this movie, and although it wasn't a waste, it's not all that great.  John Turturro and Johnny Depp are great, as well as the more minor characters like Maria Bello and Charles S. Dutton.  But what's up with all the Stephen King/corn references?  I've only read a couple of Stephen King books, and apparently the whole corn thing appears in most of them,  BUT I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S ABOUT.  The plot is corny (both literally and figuratively)and plodding.  So see it for the acting; basically, for how well the cast manages to bring a crappy screenplay to a semi-enjoyable level.
B00003CY0V|1.0|This is the kind of movie that serves as an example for picturing the worst Hollywwod has to offer. Ok, sometimes it's good to watch a pop corn brainless movie, but at least we expect some sort of decent screenplay and coherence. This movie has none.<br />The screenplay is a mess. It's a shame to witness Sam Sheppard and Tate Donovan doing absolutely nothing in three minutes of screen time at best...Travolta is at his usual bad performance, the guy is becoming a joke in the movie industry (altough earning a lot of money).<br />Berry's part is also astonishingly stupid for an Oscar winner.
0446677450|2.0|Although the two fathers were different in many ways they also had something in common.  They both believed in education. They both were influential, helping and loving of their son.  They both gave Robert advice about education and knowledge but they both gave different advice on it.  They both had different values of money one, didn't give it much care and the other thought of it as very important.  While growing up Robert though about the both ways and combined the ways of the two father. I agree with the fact that you can't rely on schools to teach you everything about money and economy.  But I also think, in most cases, having an education only until the eight grades will not make you very successful.  Because if you don't have any ideas about life, you need some education in a higher level, more than high school, to be able to run a successful business.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Okay, okay, so maybe I just don't get it. Maybe. Maybe my hair isn't long enough, or I don't know enough about philosophy, or databases....whatever. I love thoughtful movies, I love movies that dabble in the bizarre, but my requirement for those movies is that they give me somebody to care about, somebody real, somebody relatable. This movie only offered up shallow sketches of real people saying stupid and predictable emotional catchphrases over and over with the conviction of a highschool poet.<br />The beginning of the movie interested me, I felt like I was watching a sci-fi Tarantino flick. I loved the Train Man, the little girl, and Smith successfully creeped me out. But...the 1,471 minute scene involving thousands of \\"sentinels\\" (whatever) invading the human city of  Zion bored me to tears--you hear that? BORED ME! It's an action movie for goodness' sake, and all I wanted was for the stupid robots to go ahead and blow everybody, especially that Jar Jar Binksian moron-boy, straight to kingdom come. And when the commander died, I was relieved it was finally over, I wanted to laugh at him...I don't know why.<br />Bottom line is, people who already know they will love it, will love it...if you have doubts, be wary.(...)
0446677450|5.0|I have read many financial books over the years, butu Rich Dad Poor Dad is without a doubt the finest, most results oriented book I have ever read. Thank you Robert.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|What can I say?  If there is one, the soundtracks for all 3 movies should be there.  My least favorite, the Fellowship soundtrack, is merely excellent, the Two Towers has an underlying feel of growing tension faced with nobility and spirit. And the Return of the King soundtrack is simply brilliant:  Epic, uplifting, spiritual.  <br />What is truly important for a soundtrack score is not just enriching a movie, but helping a movie form an identity.  Think about it: Where would Star Wars or The Indiana Jones movies be without the genius of John Williams and his scores?  Well, howard shore does an equal job of forming an identity and character for all 3 movies with 3 very different, but all excellent, movie scores.<br />Everyone will have their favorite, but few if any will say that even one of these movie soundtracks stinks, or is &quot;merely ok.&quot;  As a collector of soundtracks, this one goes right next to my other favorite soundtrack, Amadeus.  And for Howard Shore to have his music unashamedly stand next to that of Mozart is quite a compliment indeed.
B000099T2L|4.0|The album overall is good, its not as good as peopel expected, but still worth having in ur collection!<br />crazy in love - good, makes u wanna dance and makes the girls wanna shake there butts! <br />naughty girl - a nice arabic flavoured song. one of her best songs off teh album!<br />baby boy - i feel is the best song on teh album! its sexy, sensual and sounds good! it has another arabic feel to it and also a dance hall jamaican feel with sean paul.<br />hip-hop star (rocky style, if u dont liek outcast or rock, this isnt for u),<BR> <BR>gift from virgo (very dumb song, stupid and waste of time,and is only about 2 mins. not a osng, more like a poem to jay-z), <br />yes (about a guy wanting to have sex with beyonce and she says no in the end, very boring and slow song, only for the girls) are big disappointments! <br />Be with you, is one of my favourites! its nice to singalong to and its calm and very RNB. this is a good song!<br />speechless is ok, but abit boring, and the song with luthervandross is kinda boring and slow, for all u old ppl out there. a bit of a soul feel to it.<br />thats how u like it is good, it grew on me. at first i wasnt feeling it, but its sound good now. <br />the best song on the album is DANGEROULY IN LOVE. one of the est songs ever writtern by beyonce, and it will be very hard for beyonce to top that. the destinys child version is better tho.

0767903862|5.0|Readers of Bill Bryson are familiar with his quirky and reflective sense of humor. Be prepared to grip your sides and have tears come to your eyes as Bryson describes the rudeness hotel staff in Darwin, his fear of the ocean in Sydney, and fear of the potently dangerous Australian animals in the outback. <br />Australia has long been regarded by the world as mysterious, unusual, and generally forgotten. Bryson brings Australia to the top of the world as he examines Australian phenomenon in-depth. How could a non-govenment atom bomb blow up in the desert unnoticed? How can a prime minister disappear into the surf never to be seen again, and for that matter, why would Melbourne name a municipal swimming pool after him? Why are meat pies, although full of fat, gravy, and are generally unappealing, such a big hit with the Aussie population. Who are these mysterious Australians and how did Australia become such a prosperous nation when the settlers were convicts ranging from age 8-72, and had virtually no skills that would contribute to making any economy at all?  Bryson bravely delves into these questions and more, and answers them with the whole hearted, candid style that is uniquely his own.   <br />Although this book is incredibly funny, it is also very insightful. Only Bill Bryson could describe Australia in such a colorful light. He covers subjects such as Australian history and Austrialian historians views of Australian history, what it meant to be an Australian fifty years ago and what it means today, travel and tourism, and much, much more. <br />This book is essential for anyone who has ever had a love affair with the mysterious land down under. I can't find the words to accurately praise this book. All I can say is I recommend 110%.  Whether or not you have ever gone to Oz, or whether or not you plan on going, if you are looking for information about Australia far beyond what is offered in the typical narrative or travel guide, this book is for you.
B00006V9A0|5.0|this cd is a collection of some of the best songs ever. This is in my top 10 all time favorite cd list
B000002MJR|5.0|Yes, it's extremely similar to the studio versions; yes, Mark Knopfler, as it turns out, isn't terribly good at the pronunciation.<br />So what?<br />This is *perfect*, in terms of tone and sound.  Knopfler's voice is even deeper and gruffer than usual, and on a few of them, especially Your Latest Trick, the effect is amazing.  I can't listen to anything on this album and not smile.  It's subtle, deep, and every note - EVERY note - means something.  It's not wild, it's not jammy, it's not fearlessly creative.  It's just...perfect.  They pull more emotion out of these songs than I thought possible, and that's after some amazing studio versions to start with.<br />If you want something different from the earlier albums, don't get this.  If you want refined, high-class, absolutely gorgeous subtle blues/rock, you should have owned this years ago, and I'd highly reccomend fixing your mistake as soon as possible.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I saw this movie with my 53 year old mother and my 15 year old sister (I'm 27) and we all loved it. Diane Keaton was fabulous- very funny and gutsy. Jack was Jack- funny as always. I bought this movie the day it came out- it's one of my new favorites!!      Take a chance on a great movie!!!
B00005JMSE|2.0|Recently a lot of movies have been made or are being made based on classic comic book characters. My brother and I, being comic book fanatics when we were younger, went into this movie hoping to find another entertaining adaption of a cult classic. Unfortunatley, instead we walked out realizing we had just lost an hour and a half of our lives. Despite the excellent effects, the movie lacked to entertain. The dialogue reminded me of those cheezy \\"bad movie\\" stereotypes. I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit. The plot and casting I felt portrayed the comic book well, but the deliverance of it was not even decent enough to be put on televison. BEWARE! Do not waste your money or your time on this boxoffice junk, unless you feel like making your own version of Mystery Science Theater.
0743454529|5.0|Readers of Jodi Picoult's books are accustomed to her taking us on an emotional journey and My Sister's Keeper doesn't disappoint.  You will be hooked from page one and you will want to read it all in one sitting.  A powerful, thoughtful, emotional novel that tackles an up-to-the-minute topic.  Told in the different voices of the main characters provides the reader with different sides of the same story.  A wonderful read and a great discussion book!
0385504209|3.0|A good looking guy, a good looking girl, both very smart, both in danger, both with incredible luck...  Ok, I've read books like that before...<br />Too many things seem to happen just at the right time in this book.  We just happen to have 2 people with bottomless knowledge on cryptology and symbology, perfect for the story.  And then, oh no, can you believe it?  We meet another person who knows all there's to know about the Grail!  It's just too farfetched in my opinion.  And what was the author trying to do with that simple code that never one of the main characters can figure out for a good while (you know the one)?  Come on, it was easy to see how to read it, even I who do not have any cryptology background could decipher it!  What, am I supposed to think that these 3 super intelligent characters cannot figure it out at a glance but everything else is a breeze to them?<br />Although I found the descriptions of the two religious groups and the da Vinci paintings interesting, I still cannot see why this book has been a bestseller for so long.  By the end, I didn't care if the Grail was ever found...  But that's just me.
B00003CX5P|3.0|In anticipation of ...Episode 3 and the upcoming DVD releases of the original trilogy, I thought I would give The Phantom Menace another look. And afterward I still found the same things to appreciate and abhore. I'll start with the cons: <BR>   1. First let me get Jar Jar out of the way. There is no question in my mind that this film would have been far easier to stomach if he had either been reworked into a different character or just thrown out with the bath water. Nonetheless there he is.<BR>   2. I'm not the kind of guy to pick on little kids, but everytime Jake Lloyd was on screen, I found it hard to surpress a cringe. This has more to do with writing and creative decisions than the kid. But I think they should have chosen someone at least a couple of years older.<BR>   3. I expect lame dialogue in a Star Wars movie, but fart jokes, poo humor, the future Vader saying things like \\"oops\\" and \\"Yippee\\". Are almost too much to bear.<BR>   4. The jedi council has always been something I imagined as something mysterious and profound. But I guess my expectaions were too high. When I found them doing little more than hanging around a boardroom, basking in their own self importance while they sent lackeys out on chores, I must say I was disappointed.<BR>   5. In episode 4, Luke already had some piloting chops, enough at least for the rebels to hand him a ship and go to battle. Had Lucas made Anakin a little older, he could have done the same. Instead we have Anakin saving the day by pure accident. The future Vader in essence, \\"pulled a Homer.\\"<BR>   6.Too much Jar Jar and not enough Obi-Wan. The saga is not about Jar Jar.<BR>   There are other things that chafe me as well, but you get the idea. But now to be fair there were things that I thought were good. Some quite good in fact. Here are the pros:<BR>   1. The beginning of the film got me excited. When Obi-Wan and emerge from the gas filled room and dispatched those droids it was something to behold.<BR>2. The invasion of Naboo was of such a large scale and so detailed, there's something new going on each time I see it.<BR>   3. The character of Qui-Gon was unexpected and I liked the fact he was on his own path and was annoyed with the other fuddy-duddy jedi.<BR>   4. Can you believe it? I actually liked Watto. I thought he was a much better realized character than Jar Jar, even amusing without being annoying.<BR>   5. Darth Maul, enough said.<BR>   6. The lightsaber battle is the best in all five of the movies. Too bad it's intercut with that lame battle between the droids and the Gungans.<BR>   7. I've heard people complain that the pod race is too long. But compared with the rest of the movie. It goes by in the blink of an eye.<BR>    So those are just a few of my thoughts. Now I wouldn't want anyone to think that I hate this movie. Far from. It's just that the combination of the garbage and all the great stuff make it simply an average film with above average special effects. But that won't keep me from the OT DVDs and Episode 3.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|I bought this album a few months ago and while I'm not incredibly impressed, I'm also not terribly disappointed.  The music is very soothing and relaxing and I enjoy listening to her sing.  However, her earlier work is better - hands down.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|Cheap gimmick by a record company just trying to make more money by rehashing old music, or maybe &quot;Sir&quot; Paul McCartney is not rich enough that he wants his hard working fans to part with some more of their money so he can become even richer!!!
B00018D44U|2.0|I absolutely loved her first album and unfortunately this one can't even shake a stick at &amp;quot;Come Away With Me&amp;quot;. It's too ambiguous to be categorized and too poor a showing for a category to actively seek to claim it.<br /> Save your money... hopefully her next album will make up for the flop this one is.
B00005LC4B|4.0|Robert De Niro's character Max Cady, the obvious villain is IN FACT the hero of this film. Nick Nolte was a public defender 14 years ago when he got the case of Max Cady -- a very poor illiterate. Nolte decided to play judge and jury. He gave Cady the shaft. Now Cady is out of prison and OUT FOR JUSTICE. It's some of Robert De Niro's best work! Nick Nolte does a great job as the lawyer, Sam Bowden, who did Cady wrong.<br />The Jessica Lange character, with her sniping remarks, does not really work that well.<br />This movie contains one of the best scenes in motion-picture history: The confrontation outside the restaurant between Max Cady and Kersek (played by Joe Don Baker). Watch for it!
0060528737|5.0|I loved Sabriel, was a bit ho hum about Lirael and to be honest was a little tepid about Abhorsen on the first read.  On the second read though, I realised that it is fantastic and extremely gripping and suspenseful.  A wonderful conclusion to the series although I have so many questions that I would love to have answered.  What happens to Nick?  What was the back story for Chlorr?  What happens to Sameth and Lirael?  Does the Old Kingdom ever regain its former glory or will it continue to sink into decline?????
0767805712|5.0|Eugenics as a form of social control by governments over its subjects is a very real issue. The formation of a so-called `perfect' human being by way of genetic manipulation is a current science that is developing at such a rate that the ethical issues the subject raises, and the productive dialogue required when artificially controlling life, is falling way behind. In Aldous Huxley's `Brave New World Revisited', he explores a society where genetics is used to create the perfect society, and the ethical and social implications of such a world. He does not paint a positive picture. As the main character, Vincent, in this film proclaims, \\"Discrimination has now become a science.\\" One's social status in society is solely determined by the perfections or imperfections of their genetic make-up. What does society do with its genetic imperfections? In the film, the lower end of the gene pool is relegated to menial jobs and the streets. Those without imperfections, the biological determined `elite', are placed in the prestigious and important jobs and enjoy all the benefits. More than anything else, I believe, this important film is about the strength of the human spirit over so-called biological determinism. As the main character, Vincent, shows us, the will of the spirit far outweighs one's genetic predisposition.<br />Writer/director Andrew Nicole (Simone, The Truman Show) has rendered a near perfect film depicting a not so future dystopian world where governments determine its citizen's place in society before they're even born. This is fascism in its purest form. Our protagonist, Vincent, had the misfortune of being born a `love child' conceived in the back seat of his parent's car. He is a `de(gene)rate' whose future has been already determined: a life of slovenly jobs, a marked citizen, known as an `invalid'. One day he realises, after saving his near perfect, genetically engineered brother's life, that he has what it takes to join the ranks of society's elite, and sets a plan in motion to join the Gattaca company. The lengths this boy goes to in order to achieve his goal is nothing less than astounding.<br />Considering the current lock down of our rights in society, (fingerprinting and computerized mugshots at every border airport) and due process dwindling at an alarming rate; genetic science becoming society's sole judge and executioner in our courts of law; and genetic science itself moving ahead in leaps and bounds without true and productive debate about the ethical implications, the world of Gattaca is almost upon us. As the film states at the beginning, \\"In the not so distant future.\\", is a frightening reality we must consider. This is an important film that should not be ignored.sets a plan in motion to join the Gattaca company.

B00004UFYU|4.0|As expected, this album provides great, soothing music. Excellent to listen to while at work early in the morning, and are just starting to really wake up. It's not as good as the first volume, though. Buy that one first, if you're not familiar with the style.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Well, I've always been TOTALLY anti-Britney, long-awaiting her demise. I heard this record the other day and after it 'settled in' overnight, I realized that it was actually really, really, good. She has some great songwriters.  A lot of the songs are really catchy and memorable, making you want to dance sexily!! I kind of respect her after hearing this album.  The album has a definite Madonna vibe, she definetly is hoping to follow in her footsteps. If you like cheesy-pop, this isn't the album for you. But, if you like sexy dance music, this album is purrrfect!!! And her little sad song at the end is pretty good too..<BR>Britney-- I ALMOST respect you now~

B000089RVR|2.0|I'm very disappointed.  I had such hopes for this album--  I was infatuated with No Angel, Dido's first CD, when it came out.  There were so many songs that had me addicted to her voice and melodies...  But if you're hoping for another &quot;Here With Me,&quot; &quot;Don't Think Of Me&quot; or &quot;Take My Hand,&quot; you won't find it on Life For Rent.<br />These songs seemed very lifeless to me.  &quot;White Flag&quot; is dreamy enough for my tastes, but the other songs bored me, even the first time through.  &quot;Mary's In India&quot; seems unfinished, or somehow under-constructed.  Songs like &quot;See You When You're 40&quot; and &quot;This Land Is Mine&quot; are bland and similar-sounding.  In fact, many songs on this album sound alike; not in a cohesive way, but in a tedious one.<br />I really wanted to like this album, but it just isn't very worthy.
B00018D44U|1.0|Norah Jones straight up sucks.  I don't see what the big deal is about her.  I wouldn't pay a dollar for this album.  Don't waste your money on this trash.
B00005JKHP|3.0|People tend to forget that this film was a HUGE hit when it came out.  Probably because the budget was so high (it included the cost for the abandoned &quot;ST-Phase II&quot; series) the film basically broke even.<br />The plot for Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a combo of &quot;The Changeling&quot; &amp; &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;.  All of our favorite characters are back, but there is little of the banter and warmth from the original series present. Instead, we get a kind of &quot;2001&quot; atmosphere with overlong special effect scenes (particularly the overblown Enterprise in drydock &amp; V'Ger cloud sequences) and underwelming acting.  Shatner's plea to Bones that he needs him &quot;BADLY!&quot; is almost too funny for words.<br />  Most &quot;Director's Cuts&quot; are vanity pieces that may appeal to hardcore movie buffs, but really don't improve a film.  But in this case, a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; was really needed.  Star Trek: The Motion Picture suffered from an incomplete script and a truncated post production that prevented completion of several special effect sequences and even a preview which would've helped director Robert Wise to tighten and improve the film.  Now, twenty years later he's been given the chance to do just that.<br />The Director's Cut trims bits and pieces from several scenes to improve the pace.  Fortunately, they did cut out Shatner's delivery of the line &quot;Oh..My...God...&quot; (from the transporter malfunction scene) which could be the worst in film history.  However, you can see all the deleted scenes, as well as three short documentaries, and other tidbits.  The commentaries are fairly bland, but informative.<br />As for the film itself, standouts include Leonard Nimoy's return as Spock.  In fact, this could be the best story about Spock ever filmed. I also enjoyed the opening attack by the Klingons and any scene with DeForest Kelly.<br />The best part though is Jerry Goldsmith's incredible score, which somehow lost the Oscar to &quot;A Little Romance&quot;.  In fact, I would heartily recommend the soundtrack over the film.  Still, the Director's Cut is an improvement and worth checking into if your a trekker who sorta liked the movie when it first came out.ch somehow lost the Oscar to &quot;A Little Romance&quot;.

My favorite songs are \\"Till I Collapse\\" \\"Say What You Say\\" and \\"Square Dance.\\"  My least favorite song was \\"Without Me.\\"  The guest appearances were all good (D12, Obie Trice, Dr. Dre, Timbaland.)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|When it was on the air I never caught a single episdoe of Firefly and now I feel sorry I did not.  On a whim and at the suggestion of a couple friends I bought this DVD set and after seeing all 14 episodes I do not regret one bit the loss in my checking account.  This series had such potential and Fox gave up on it with out seeing what it was going to do.  There is other SciFi on the air that started slow but has become great (Stargate SG1, Andromeda, Farscape just to name a couple) but networks gave them a shot and they turned into gold for them.  This release of this wonderful series from the Fox network is proof once again that SciFi never gets its due on the major networks.  I am so looking forward to the movie as I watch my set of episodes a second time since getting it this weekend.<br />(PS Am I the only one ticked that we will never get to hear what Shepard Book's story is now that this series is off the air?)

0393316041|4.0|Richard Feynman's novel, \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" was a true joy. Yes, I had to read it for a Physics assignment, and yes, I chose it because it was one of the few interesting-looking ones, but I had a good time reading it in spite of it all. Feynman's series of vignettes about his life experiences were extremely amusing and the quick change of pace from story to story made this book a real page turner. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone needing a good read, a funny biography, or a physics assignment.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|I was at first hesitant to buy this CD. The song \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" is undeniably catchy, and great as a single to intoduce Jet to the masses. However, I was afraid that it would turn out to be the sole good song on the album, and that Jet would prove to be a mere one-hit-wonder.    Despite my assumption, I went ahead and bought the CD, and, much to my surprise, I found the entire album to be fantastic. I was especially surprised at the number of slow, mellow songs on the record. The album's producers did an excellent job of intermixing the Stones-evocative rock songs (\\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl,\\" \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\") with the ballads (\\"Look What You've Done,\\" \\"Timothy\\"). Obviously I was wrong in assuming Jet a one-hit-wonder.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|If ever there are prizes for the best directorial comebacks, then surely Peter Weir should have one. The Aussie director of classics such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, Gallipoli,Year of Living Dangerously,Dead Poet's Society and the underrated Truman Show returns with force after five years absence (Truman being his last in '98) with a powerful film that will engage you in its clever dialog and dazzle you with its well edited action, Master and Commander: the Far Side of The World.<BR>Based on a novel by Patrick O'Brien and a screenplay by Weir himself, it is the cat and mouse chase in the Pacific ocean during Napoleonic times, between a British ship commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey and a much stronger French vessel.<BR>The success of the film in my opinion lies firmly with the screenplay, and the well written characters that perfectly reflect their time and environment. In a short time, the viewer will find him/herself totally immersed in their individual stories, and will sympathize with their condition, be saddened by their losses and cheer their successes..<BR>I found myself transfixed at the anecdotes at the captain's dinner table about Lord Nelson, touched by the heroism of the little boy, amused by the grumpiness of the steward Killick, and bemused by the sailors superstitions.<BR>And this is not easily achieved but shows that Weir indeed possesses a great talent for writing that equals his visual sensitivities.<BR>The action scenes, safe to say are very well directed and (equally important edited as well). I liked the fact the French vessel remains up until the end of the film, elusive and 'ghost like', as the whole film is seen exclusively through the 'eyes' and point of view of the British ship.<BR>The scenery is quite impressive, especially the ones filmed in the Galapagos islands.<BR>Now the acting, <BR>I don't if anyone could have played Aubrey's part better than Russell Crowe! He simply plays the part to perfection, and you can clearly tell that he was very much at ease in this role, while all the other actors (mainly British) give brilliant performances that complement Crowe's lead role and Weir's masterful direction, especially Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy and David Threlfall.<BR>The world of cinema is full of good directors as well as mediocre and bad ones, but only a handful can be considered artists in the truest sense of this word, (especially these days) and Peter Weir is certainly one. You have to see Master and Commander..to know what I mean and to applaud one helluva comeback!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is a perfect album overviewing the Guns N Roses, but im still pretty dissapointed. I mean, i've been waiting for years for the GNR's 6th studio album, (Chinese Democracy) but after almost 14 years i get this instead. C'mon Axl, hurry up
B00005JKCH|3.0|A great movie for those who are new to Spider-Man.  The plot is very accurate with few exceptions.  However, for those who are long time Spider-Man fans like myself, you have heard this story a thousand times and there is little else to keep your attention.  The only other problem with it is that it doesn't have enough fighting scenes.  Hopefully the sequel which is due out soon will improve in those areas.

B0000BWVCM|2.0|I hated the first movie and gave it one star.  This movie got two stars because it had more action and the characters branch out a bit.  It still has plenty of plot discrepancies and I'm pissed off that Sabretooth didn't make an appearance.  They seemed to have given Lady Deathstrike, who was a human and not a mutant, all his powers along with his storyline.<br />If you want to see a good comic book movie, go rent Blade 1 or 2, Daredevil, the Hulk or Spawn.

B0001IN07Q|5.0|A thrill a minute recording.<br />This vocalist takes us to new heights with the release of this masterpiece of sound and film. The editing makes a seamless, clean and polished musical journey come to life.<br />With my partner, we watched spellbound. The title is apropo - the reference to 'flying' is well chosen, for the time flew watching, and Michael and his talented young band escorted us around the world - what a trip.<br />I'd recommend this for all lover's of great music.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|As most audiences know, &quot;West Side Story&quot; is a modern-day musical based on Shakespeare's tragedy ROMEO AND JULIET.  In this updated version of the story, two rival New York City street gangs known as the &quot;Sharks&quot; and the &quot;Jets&quot; replace the feuding Montague and Capulet families of the original play.<br />&quot;West Side Story&quot; was originally released in 1961.  Yet its brilliance remains undiminished.  From the dazzling, street-smart direction by Robert Wise to Jerome Robbins' innovative choreography which melds raucous athleticism with balletic grace and precision, &quot;West Side Story&quot; is an unqualified triumph.<br />Leonard Bernstein's vibrant, inventive, and uncommonly beautiful melodies challenge and engulf the audiences' senses.  Bernstein's score is still one of the finest ever written for theater or film.<br />Stephen Sondheim's verse is poetic and socially relevant.  Sondheim expresses himself with economy and clarity which are highly effective.<br />There are few musicals on stage or on screen as riveting as &quot;West Side Story&quot;. Don't miss this one!
B00013F38K|5.0|I wanted to jump in with those who, like me, think this is a great buy if you enjoyed the series, and thought it was something special. Considering this was aired over 30 years ago, the color and quality of the DVD are excellent. The sound is average but acceptable. I know it was cropped for the widescreen effect, but I can say that if you are watching it for the enjoyment of the viewing experience, you will not be disappointed. I have watched the first disk and, after a few minutes, completely forgot about this on-line controversy. I think I would have preferred it to be as it was originally aired, but it did not affect my enjoyement of this classic. In some strange way, the widescreen version almost makes it more 'movie-like'. This is one alteration that I don't think matters.
B00004XQ83|1.0|What ever induced the Coen brothers to release a soundtrack in this media I will never know.

Plain and simple.

I am dumber for watching it.
B00008J4P5|1.0|This is absolutly terrible.  I heard some of there songs on the radio and thought it was alright. I got the album for free, some kind of promotion and it absolutly sucked.  This is probably as low as music today will go.  The songs are bland, no sololing, no sign of musical intelligence or knowledge.  All in all, a complete waste of money and time.  Someone would have to pay me to listen to this cd.
0156027321|4.0|Pi is made fun of in school for his real name Piscine Molitar Patel.  His parents hate the new government that comes into power in India and decide to move to Canada.  Pi's father is a zookeeper so he sells as many animals that he can and prepares to move the rest with them.  On the trip the ship sinks and Pi is the only survivor on a life boat.  He is stuck on the lifeboat with a hyena, tiger, zebra, and an orangutang.  His chance for survival becomes slim yet he manages to pull through.  I found the book to be surprisingly interesting and informative.  It encourages faith and that theme is one that should be shared with everyone.
0451527046|5.0|Though some people may not find much that this book offers in comparison to more recent books, I think that it meets the goals of its author very well. The book is simply something that has stood the test of time because it is a very simple story. There are no major plot twists or complexities. It is something that could be read to a child (And as a side note, the alchohol mentioned was a common practice of pirates and fully helps to show the baseness of them and show them as having no standards whatsoever, also it was more common in the time period written of that people drank alchohol rather than water for various reasons. The mear fact of that is something that adds an historical aspect to the story). The wording of everything also lends both atmosphere and a chance for a story-teller to embelish on accents and such. Overall, with this book being compared to any of the Treasure Island movies or remakes, you can't beat the original. This story, almost by itself it seems to me, created the entire Pirate Archetype in literature. All the aspects of language set in this book have been followed by later books and movies. So to say this book isn't worth reading is simply a lack of (or for that matter, an excessive ammount of pride in one's) intelligence. It is a simple, good book that is quite a page turner in my oppinion.
B00013RC9I|4.0|French duo Air returns to top form with the excellent &quot;Talkie Walkie,&quot; a charming collection of cool, soft electropop. Air fans won't be disappointed by the combination of the strong points of past releases. It sounds fresh and new, but not TOO new. Air stays connected to what it's done in the past.<br />&quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; is a solid collection of pop (the haunting &quot;Run&quot; and beautiful &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot;), quiet psychedelica (catchy, futuristic-sounding &quot;Surfing on a Rocket&quot;) and beautiful instrumentals (the acoustic-based &quot;Mike Mills&quot;). It's cool and quietly sweeps across your senses, like sitting on the beach and letting the waves run over your feet.<br />Don't expect the second chapter of &quot;Moon Safari.&quot; The latest Air release has a more experimental sound, as if they're trying to make everything balance out. And their attempt is pretty much successful. The dreamy, slightly vulnerable songwriting blends perfectly with a mix of acoustic and electronic music.<br />At times, &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; sags slightly with a riff that doesn't belong or a song that could have been shorter. Most of the time, though, it boasts some pretty impressive instruments -- piano, strings, electric drums, bells and smooth soundscapes. Lyrics are simple, especially in the sweet love song &quot;Venus&quot; (&quot;If you walk in the sun/I will be your shadow&quot;).<br />Smooth, cool and otherworldly, &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; is a beautifully-made release by a talented band. This elegant album is a must-have for music fans.

B0001HAHXW|4.0|Upon first listening to this I was slightly disappointed. After a few more tries it slowly began to make musical sense: this is an extremely subtle interpretation of Johnson's songs done as an ensemble. It could also have been titled 'Robert Johnson goes to Chicago' as the playing has the intricate, weave-like feel of the great Muddy Waters band of the 50ies.<BR>The players are first rate and have to be lauded for such unselfish teamwork. One common misconception about the blues is the supposed lack of sophistication, where in reality great blues playing is all about nuance and command over tone and timing. Clapton has become a master at this and while I certainly agree about the blandness of a lot of his studio output, he has to be credited for never showing off with empty virtuosity, something that can't be said of a lot of other guitar players, no matter how great they might be. I also think that Clapton has grown considerably as a singer and is giving a heartfelt performance here devoid of any of the 'make me sound black in the mix'  treatments that sometimes marred his otherwise great  blues album 'From the cradle' 10 years ago.<BR>I suggest the one star reviewers here check out some of the classic blues records like Muddy Waters 'Folk Singer' or Jimmie Rodgers 'Chicago Bound' , 2 great examples of the subtle, understated though highly charged power of the blues.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Now, I'm not a big fan of the whedon guy, and could care less for his other shows (why anyone but teenagers likes Buffy is a mystery to me - must be stunted emotional development ;), but this series is fantastic.  I hadn't watched weekly television like this since Hill Street Blues or ST-TNG.  Awesome watching, but it is truly sad to think this is it.  The characters are diverse and all lovable, there's mystery in their backgrounds (why does the Sheperd know so much about weapons?), and tasty moral dilemmas every episode - and great humor in the dialogue.  Great for any sci-fi fan.
B000069AUI|4.0|A rush of blood to the head blew me away from the start.  They have extremely excellent songs, with great lyrics that actually have meaning!! The reason why i gave this album a 4 out of 5, instead of a plain 5 out of 5 was because some songs were less great than others, but other than that this is a great album!!<BR>My absolute favourite song on the album, is &quot;A rush of blood to the head&quot;. Weirdly enough, this song barely gets any reviews, which confuzzles me, because it deserves it!! This song has a very powerful message.  I also loved &quot;the scientist&quot;,<BR>&quot;amsterdam&quot;, &quot;god put a smile upon your face&quot;, &quot;clocks&quot; and &quot;in my place&quot;. However, almost all reviews that i have previously read, have said that &quot;the scientist&quot; is the best song on the album.  I can't argue that this isn't a good song, however its not the best, only the song &quot;a rush of blood to the head&quot; takes it place instead.  This cd is great if your looking for mellow, laid back music.  Chris Martin has great vocals, and he plays the piano wonderfully.  In fact all the instruments are superbly played in all the songs.  People have compared<BR>Radiohead (whoohoo radiohead!!! one of my fav. bands of all time)to coldplay.  I can see where they are coming from, but i also disagree with that statement.  Radiohead has a completely different sound and message that they want to get across.  Coldplay is more about love, and quietness, than political awareness.  <BR>For fans that love this album, just like me, i also recomend all of Radioheads cd's (espically OK computer),Oasis, Red Hot Chili Peppers(probably their californication album), Pink Floyd, and some Led Zeppelin for good measure(their volume IV is the best)<BR>Buy Rush of blood to head now, you won't ever, ever, EVER regret it. \m/-_-\m/
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This movie is neither terrible nor great.  Bill Murray is fairly humorous at times.  <br />The good parts of this movie are based on Bill Murray's work and what the various entities of Sophia's father's high powered production team produce.  <br />In other words, any of us could have made this movie with the resources Ms. Coppola had and it would have come out about the same.  <br />Again not a terrible movie, but it is somewhat limp.  The story is not terribly compelling.  Sorry, it just isn't.  Mostly autobiographical evidently. <br />Some cheap shots are taken at the Japs' expense, especially in the language department.  The hooker scene for example.  The hooker keeps saying to Bill Murray \\"lip it off\\" meaning to say \\"rip it off\\" referring to her stockings.  What's creative or funny about that?  You can hear that kind of humor on any morning drive 'neck radio station.  The scene is tolerable due to Bill Murray's antics but that's all.<br />The movie's plotline is kind of dreary.  To make it more \\"artistic\\" many landscape shots are present.  You can only do so many shots of Tokyo out the hotel window or from driving around in cars before you realize they are substitute for a solid plotline.<br />I liked the ambiguous ending though that will make it even worse for many of you.  Definitely a chick movie I'd say but it's watchable.
0316666343|1.0|I finally broke down and read this book because of all the buzz it generated - after all, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; generated a lot of buzz, and it was an excellent book.  Unfortunately, this book reminded me of why I shy away from books on the best seller lists:  They're usually pap.  I think I'll go back to avoiding the best seller lists.
B000056BOR|4.0|Now available on DVD.  No old scratchy,faded print to watch.  The only problem with this DVD version is, it is shown in squeezy wide-screen.  Takes the enjoyment out of watching.  Doris Day gets caught in the rain in New York City.  She gets splashed from the road water by a very luxurious car with a well-to-do man inside, Cary Grant.  Doris ends up at the employment agency where John Astin, who is a clerk, once again tries to ask her for a date.  But his thoughts are more aggressive.  But Doris is a lady and turns him down.  She goes to cafe where through the tuna salad window compartment she gossips with Audrey Meadows who is a server on the other side.  Cary Grant sees Doris and apologizes for him for splashing her with the car.  So Gig Young does his duty, and Doris says \\"Money doesn't buy good manners\\".  Reluctantly, Doris goes with Gig to meet this tychoon.  When they meet, it's love at first sight.  She calls Audrey Meadows, her friend, and naturally her friend is concerned all she can do is offer some good sound advice.  She doesn't want her friend to be hurt.  Very cute, mature film for the middle-aged adults.  Many laughs along the way.  Dick Sargent (Bewitched tv series) has a small role.  Just wait until you see what havoc Doris Day causes at the UNIVAC building.  The first computer database.
B000002L80|5.0|I can't imagine why other TH fans don't love this album as much as I do. From the cover by Rev. Howard Finster to the classic &quot;Walk It Down,&quot; the &quot;Little Creatures&quot; album is everything it should be. Irony lives.
6302158249|2.0|This 1983 concert was not the band at their best.  The instrumentals ramble at times in the first half. This version of 'Romeo and Juliet' is a stinker and no match for the studio original.  Knopfler's vocals are not up to scratch in some tracks either and in some songs on this video has an annoying habit of changing the lyrics from their original form.  Parts of the concert have been edited and it clearly shows.<br />The second half is better though, the strongest tracks by far are 'Sultans of Swing', 'Tunnel of Love' and 'Telegraph Road'.  The 'Going Home' theme is good too.  I saw the group live in 1986 and they played a much better concert than this one so I say stick to the original studio albums.
B000059S9M|5.0|This is the most fantastic album i have ever heard.  i don't think I truely appreciated music until I first heard Feeder!  They really are amazing and this album completely showcases them.  Every song is great in its own way and it's so difficult to chose a favourite because of this.  There are 'happy' songs like Buck Rodgers and Seven Days in the Sun which make you want to leap around playing air guitar and more mellow ones like Turn and Oxygen that are great at making you reflect on life.  if you don't listen to it you are really missing out!
B00004Y6NT|5.0|'Communique' was unfairly criticised after the critical acclaim that the first one received.  The first one is good but this one is also.  It is the most underrated Dire Straits' album.  A significant one for the band not just because it was the last one to feature the original lineup including David Knopfler; the group's personnel changed frequently thereafter.<br />All nine songs, whilst not among the very best or most famous of their work are very appealing and there are no duds here.  Knopfler's story-telling provides an interesting scenario throughout.  The recording location is powerful as well.  Its a more laid-back sound and introduces keyboards which their first album did not have.  'Once Upon A Time in the West' features a reggae beat which the band rarely used.<br />Perhaps if they had a major hit single or radio faviourite from this one it would have performed better. 'Lady Writer' is most likely to have been released as a single.  'Single Handed Sailor' is another strong track from the album.  It then gives way to the crashing of the waves which open the closing 'Follow Me Home' which is flawless.  <br />All in all a solid effort from the group before they made it big, released at a time when punk and disco dominated the headlines.  Almost 25 years later and this album - as is their debut album - is still a sound for all time.
0061015725|2.0|Crichton writes some great books.  This just isn't one of them!  This was Jurassic Park with Nanomachines replacing the dinosaurs and it just didn't do much for me.  Characterization was poor and after awhile, you get the impression that Crichton has never worked or been around real life people.<br />I enjoyed Airframe because Crichton was RIGHT on about the causes 0f such accidents and the flack that surrounds a crash.<br />I liked Timeline because he did a good job of throwing us into a good time travel yarn, which has not been done properly for many years.<br />I liked Jurassic Park because of the ideas presented.<br />The Terminal Man was exciting.<br />Congo was silly, but still enjoyable.<br />This novel was just really a sorry reason for the death of some trees.  It was a waste of my time as well as Crichton's efforts.
0062502182|5.0|It was a good omen when I saw this book on Amazon and ordered it last week.  It came in the mail today, and I read the entire book today.  This book is great.  No, it's not for everyone.  It's for those of us who are following our dreams, or as the book says: personal legend.  It's no surprise to me that some people fail to &quot;see&quot; the true lessons behind this story.  It is because they fail to listen to their heart, and do not understand the &quot;universal language.&quot;  This book is a great guide for anyone who truly wishes to follow her or his dream.  And even if you've already acheived your dream, this book will help you understand better the path you took to get there.  Nothing is immpossible in this world, and nothing is possible without dreams!
0385336810|4.0|It was a quick read - I read it in an evening - but an enjoyable one. The story was humorous, the characters were likeable (except for the ones you're not supposed to like), and of course it all comes out right in the end!<br />I'm giving it 4 stars mainly because it was short - I would have liked more! But overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and it left me with a smile on my face.
B000063DFN|5.0|Okay, let's review:<br />Aces High:<BR>Welcome to the beginning of the greatest Iron Maiden album ever. The song starts off hard and fast and never slows down. Whoa.<BR>Grade: A+<br />Two Minutes To Midnight:<BR>A killer song, and one of the more popular Iron Maiden hits. Personally, I think it's good, but not quite as good as some of the other songs on this album.<BR>Grade: A<br />Losfer Words (Big 'Orra):<BR>Ahhh... the instrumental. Essential in every great metal album. Unfortunately, if you're looking for the next \\"Call of Ktulu\\" (by Metalica) or \\"Genghis Khan\\" (by IRON MAIDEN!!!), you'll be disappointed. Losfer Words maintains kind of a bright mood throughout the song and, although it's really good, it doesn't measure up to the greats.<BR>Grade: A-<br />Flash Of The Blade:<BR>Kind of a pointless song. Sure, the guitar kicks butt, but the subject matter (swordfighting) isn't what I listen to metal for.<BR>Grade: B+<br />The Duellists:<BR>Read the above review. This song continues the \\"swordfighting\\" theme, and it's only decent, not spectacular.<BR>Grade: B<br />Back In The Village:<BR>I like this song just fine. But no more than that. I think it's just not what i'm used to. Other people love it, though, so don't take my advice too closely.<BR>Grade:A-<br />Powerslave:<BR>BOO-YAH!!! This is what i'm talking about! The title track, about an Egyptian king about to die, is one of the best songs on the album. The guitar is absolutely AMAZING, and the change of pace around the 2:00 mark in the song helps. The whole album is almost worth it just for this song. Once again: Whoa.<BR>Grade: A+<br />Rime Of The Ancient Mariner:<BR>The. Best. Song. On. The. Album. This 13-minute monster, based on a Samuel Taylor Coleridge song, is one of the best pieces of music i've ever heard, right up there with songs like Master of Puppets, Iron Man, and the earlier Maiden hit Hallowed Be Thy Name. Period. I actually think that the slower bass part near the 6-minute mark is a GOOD thing. 13 minutes of the same old blah, even if it does sound amazing, gets a little boring.... which is why the mood and pace of the song change several times. I gladly bought this album after hearing just this one song, and never regretted it.<BR>Grade: A++(hell, i'll chuck another plus on)+<br />All in all, if you consider yourself a Maiden fan, you have to have this album in your collection. I would also recommend it to fans of every other true metal band (Metallica pre-Black Album, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Dio, etc.) if they're willing to try something new.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|The fact that this film was written, produced and directed by a woman only reinforces my theory that we ARE our own worst enemy.<BR>     Nicholson's performance was a phone in.  There's no getting around his charm...he'll always have a charisma that is difficult to turn away from.  Keaton was, I believe, playing herself more than anything -- the dopey laugh, the painful discomfort around others -- with the exception that Keaton in real life has matured to the point of understanding that one can be a complete human sans love affairs.  If only she would raise her standards in script choices (&quot;First Wives Club?&quot; Blech!)<BR>     The &quot;moral&quot; of the movie is that you must open yourself up to the pain to really feel alive.  Wow!  What a revelation.  Who woulda' thunk it?  I guess that Keaton's character opening herself up to the pain in her daughter's life, her sister's life, her ex's life wouldn't have worked?  Oh, no...ya gotta' have a man.<BR>     Amanda Peet as the daughter is a doll.  She glows on screen and was the only believable characterization in the whole film.  Keanu was his usual leaden self, with just a touch of slime ball thrown in for good measure.  I heard Keaton interviewed and she said that he's a terrific kisser.  Good, she's been around long enough to be a good judge and she's paid enough dues to deserve to be kissed well. Francis McDormand is one of the greatest actresses of our time, and I can only assume she needed a new car or something to have taken this role.<BR>     If you're in the mood to watch Nicholson chew the scenery, watch Keaton get embarrassed or watch Reeves play doctor, you might find 128 minutes worth of fun in this film.  If you are a strong believer that romantic love is a wonderful thing, a glorious thing, a special thing...BUT NOT A NECESSITY FOR A FULL LIFE, this film will infuriate you and make you wish you'd watched &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot; again instead.
B000002NJS|1.0|Boy, what a pile of dung. All of it. I fully agree with all the electronica fans who rated it as garbage.<br />Oh, hold on a second: I just remembered, all of electronica sucks, every single &quot;song&quot; or whatever electronica is.<br />So let me rephrase my critic: this album is a great, perfect example of today's electronica.
B00003CWRX|5.0|From the first image, the viewer is immediately thrust into a situation with no explanation and no dialogue. It takes a few seconds before it is revealed to be a blindfolded man who is being driven through a busy, noisy Middle Eastern city. What's going on here? Who is he? The rush of noises and images is an assault on the senses. The blindfolded man, Lowell Bergman (Pacino), is here to set up an interview with the Sheik for 60 Minutes. Michael Mann introduces Bergman in this fashion to grab the audience's attention with a single detail and then gradually expands out to the bigger picture, which symbolizes the film's structure and its style. The events in the picture are created from a single event and everything grows from that one incident.<br />This scene establishes the no-nonsense tone of the movie and the professionalism of the characters. Lowell Bergman is a worldly man who is not afraid to speak his mind. He is willing to go, literally, blind into a potentially dangerous situation to get what he wants. He is a consummate professional who knows how to handle things: the quintessential Mann protagonist. In a way, the professional nature of Mann's characters is reminiscent of the no-nonsense characters that populate the films of Howard Hawks and Don Siegel.<br />Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe)'s introduction is also important in how it establishes his character. He is shown in the foreground of the scene but is out of focus. There is a party going on in the background that is in focus but we cannot hear it. Wigand is almost obscured by the party goers who are oblivious to him. Wigand is all alone in his office which establishes right away that he is an isolated protagonist. This is reinforced by the shot of him in his office: it is dark, he is alone, very quiet.<br />While the family life scenes in Heat felt weak and under-developed, they are much stronger and are more crucial to the narrative in The Insider. It doesn't hurt that he's got an excellent cast here: Lindsay Crouse, Diane Venora, Christopher Plummer, Philip Baker Hall, et al.<br />One of Mann's strengths is how he conveys expositional dialogue. This is very difficult without boring an audience conditioned to tune out during long, talky scenes. However, a scene between Bergman and his co-workers over lunch works because of how Mann shoots and edits the scene. They are sitting around talking and brainstorming about Wigand and the danger of interviewing him. There is a lot of exposition and facts about tobacco being thrown around but Mann uses multiple camera set-ups and has such talented actors speaking the dialogue that it keeps everything interesting. There are a lot of different camera angles in this scene but the editing is not done in a rapid-fire haphazard fashion like in a Michael Bay film where no shot lasts for more than thirty seconds. There is the feeling that Mann knows what an edit means and that they are not intrusive but rather allow the scene to flow organically.<br />The scene between Bergman and Wigand in the Japanese restaurant is the centerpiece of the film; much in the same way that the Lecktor/Graham conversation in Manhunter and the Hanna/McCauley restaurant scene in Heat are important because they all represent the meeting of the driving forces of their respective films. The characters meet, verbally spar with each other, convey, either implicitly or explicitly, their worldview and most important sort things out between each other. The dialogue in this scene really crackles and pops with intensity.<br />The DVD is a bit of a disappointment. While the transfer is top notch and the audio is fantastic, the lack of extras is a missed opportunity to be sure. This film deserves the deluxe Criterion Collection treatment. Mann has been revisiting some of his films lately, with a new edition of Manhunter with an audio commentary and new 2-DVD special editions of Heat and Ali on the horizon.

B0000033P2|2.0|This is what somebody should have told these guys before they released Trilogy. But who cares when everybody is crazy about symphonic-ish rock? They would buy the album anyway, right?<br />This album contains many long songs. And I mean, long, like in loooooong. Even better, like in &quot;artificially stretched out&quot;. It's not a matter of today's listeners having a short span attention as many dinosaur rock lovers would make you believe. It's just, the ideas on this album might reasonably cover five or six minutes of music. Everything else is filler -no matter how many Moog sounds you put into it.
B00004YM0D|5.0|I picked up this soundtrack almost immediately after I saw this movie in theater. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever purchased.<br />This one has a lot of great oldies on it from a lot of big artists. You've got &quot;Aint No Mountain High Enough&quot; from Marvin Gaye which is a great song. There's &quot;Up Around the Bend by CCR. You also have &quot;Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress by The Hollies. &quot;Spirit of the Sky&quot; is also here by Norman Greenbaum. To top it off you also have &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss him Goodbye&quot; by Steam to top off all the hits. It's a hit powered soundtrack that can please a big age gap.<br />I was a little disappointed with the Titans Score. I like the song in the movie but they didn't get right on the soundtrack. Thats the only knock I can put down on this soundtrack. Other than that it's perfect.<br />I love this soundtrack. My parents love this one a lot. It's one of the better ones I own and if you loved the movie you have to pick this up.
B00009Z574|1.0|...better use it to smash these guys' huge egos. What were they thinking? I guess Tormato is from 1978, a time when prog rock was all but dead. It was time to cut down on the ego trips and put together a bit of solid music. <br />But &quot;cut down on the ego trips&quot;? Sure, yeah! Try telling Jon Anderson to do so. This is one of the worst albums by Yes. Ok, I admit it, the newer ones are worse. And some of the really old ones are even much worse. I guess the problem here is, most of Yes' albums are terrible.
B000055Y0X|4.0|Still hysterical and meaningful...<br />This is not the stuff that Hollywood is made of anymore. Subversive and discontented. Pointed but funny. Well acted, uncompromising and completely focused on the end result.  <br />Sounds weird?<br />By today's standards it is weird. I also think it's virtually perfect. There are a whole bunch of people who will watch this and just scratch their heads. Coming away un-moved and un-concerned. That's okay because people watch really horrible sitcoms and use words like \\"brilliant\\"...<br />There's something for everybody <br />Dr. Strangelove is a really funny movie, perhaps requiring a few moments to \\"get the hang of\\" and time to acquire a taste for. I hope a few more people give it that chance. Peter Sellers as Lionel Mandrake is so funny I can hardly sit still when I watch him. He also nails the President character and without requiring a mention as Dr. Strangelove he's just so right on the money. <br />I'm a huge fan of this movie..
B0000033OZ|1.0|The first time I listened to the solo in Lucky Man, I thought &quot;this is a very interesting new instrument&quot;.<br />After I listened to the thing for a hundred times, I couldn't help noticing it was just a silly ballad after all. As for the other themes, well, these guys seemed to believe they were some sort of serious composers, right? (huh-huh-huh...)<br />I never got to listen to it a thousand times -I threw the darn vinyl album away and never cared to get the CD. Not much to miss.
6300215717|5.0|Roman holiday-a time of enjoyment derived from the suffering of others.<br />Well, that's a dictionary's definition, but I guarantee that suffering is the diametric opposite for anyone watching Audrey Hepburn's starring debut.  Ms. Hepburn stars as Princess Anne of some unnamed European kingdom.  Fed up with her heavily scheduled public relations agenda in the Eternal City, Anne goes into hysterics and flees the palace, but not before the doctor injects her with a powerful sedative.  She's rescued by Joe Bradley, a reporter with the American News Service, who takes her to his apartment and being a gentleman, does not take advantage of her in her drugged-out state.<br />It isn't long before he finds out who she is and after tailing her, &quot;bumps&quot; into her on Rome's Spanish Steps, where she's had a new haircut and enjoying an ice cream.  There was difficulty in shooting this scene due to the heckling of spectators.<br />Bradley enlists the aid of Irving Radovic, a photographer, promising to cut him in on an exclusive story he wants to make on the princess.  Some of the things he does to Irving to prevent their game from getting rumbled would only work in this kind of comedy.  Together, the princess, ostensibly incognito to her charges, gets the free day she wants.  Her half-lie that she's a schoolgirl playing hookey only makes her outing all the more fun.<br />The title concept holds true as Anne goes walkabout while causing her chaperones much alarm, to the extent of sending men-in-black after her.  Also, Anne's excursion takes place in the Eternal City after all.  But it's also one for Bradley, whose boss wants him to get an exclusive on the princess, and Bradley's initial exploitative objective eventually turns into a holiday he wants Anne to have.  Also, the phrase &quot;Roman holiday&quot; is derived from the gladiatorial contests the ancient Romans enjoyed, especially in the Colisseum, which ironically is where the half-insensate Anne mumbles as her place of residence to Bradley upon their first meeting.<br />There are also a few bits of slapstick involved.  One is the  Mouth of Truth scene, the relic sculpted on the Colisseum, a face with eyes and mouth.  Legend says that if a liar sticks his/her hand in there, it will be bitten off.  Something silly does happen, which I will not reveal.<br />This was nominated for ten Academy Awards (but not Best Actor!!!)  Surely Gregory Peck's solid, dependable, and ultimately romantically touched performance deserved a nomination at least?  Eddie Albert (Irving) was nominated for Best Supporting Actor (and lost).  It also lost Best Picture, but won for original screenplay and costume design.  Hmm, I seem to have forgotten one, but which one?  Hmm... All kidding aside, Audrey Hepburn won, beating out Deborah Kerr, Ava Gardner, and Leslie Caron for Best Actress.<br />And it took five years for it to reach production.  Writer John Dighton was actually blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo.  Co-writer Ian McClellan Hunter had to act as a front, taking credit for the Oscar-winning story for 40 years until a posthumous Oscar was given to Trumbo's widow.<br />Shot totally in Rome, this unforgettable movie marked Audrey Hepburn's road to stardom.  Her photogenic quality is well demonstrated with a fetching smile, that graceful figure, and of course a charming personality.

B000002J1S|2.0|At least among the die hard prog rock fans who read these reviews, probably yes. But that guy was really terrible... Phil Collins was -still is!- so much better, but how can one say so without attracting a legion of &quot;pop hit ballad haters&quot;...<br />Anyway, The Lamb is lots of effect, little or no substance. I can picture poor bald Phil sitting behind the drums -he's always been an awesome drummer- and thinking &quot;man, I wish we stopped playing these crummy pretentious thang and do some good music for once, even if it does not have fifty chord changes per minute...&quot;
B000066I6N|5.0|After seeing Robert and his band on an incredible &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; telecast, I picked this up. This guy really hasn't gotten all the respect due to him, even from myself in the past. The fact is that Plant was probably the most threatening frontman in the world as far as guys were concerned, a wicked unrepentant woman-stealer who could sing it as pretty or as hard as anyone. Daltrey you could see as your barroom buddy, Mick and Keith were getting clobbered for all our sins, and the Beatles were more pop than rock and no threat to anything, but Plant and Zeppelin were hard as nails.  When it comes to being a vital, vibrant solo artist, he's pretty much trumped them all put together.  This is a great album, and as much as many reviews emphasize the ballads, there is some scalding rock n roll here. &quot;Hey Joe&quot; is totally intense, and when the harmonica kicks in on &quot;Red Dress&quot; it's as heavy as the first time the levee broke. The band is dangerous, and the man in front of them has the taste, the leadership, and a voice that can still do it all.  A surprise and a delight. I thought Jack White had the best album of last year until I heard this and Jeff Beck's &quot;Jeff&quot;. The masters ain't masters for nothing. Lastly, &quot;Song To The Siren&quot; is one of the greatest recordings I have ever heard. And it FEELS like an album, there's no reason to skip anything here. The guy is on top of his game and if this was a new artist people would be doing headstands praising this. Right now if I could see any act in the world play live it would be this outfit. Anyway, to sum up, this disc will give you the chills when you're not rocking 'round the living room. Beautiful and edgier than a wildcat, often at the same time.
B0000033TE|1.0|I remember when I listened to this record for the first time in a record shop, a mature guy looked truly upset and said &quot;this is garbage!&quot; I was a silly prog rock teen then so I looked at him with contempt. What does this old geezer know, I thought.<br />Turns out the old geezer was sooooo right.<br />This album is terrible. Why listening to all that massive keyboard layers in Jerusalem, when any old church choir can do a more convincing, emotional version? Or why listening to Emerson's dubious synth experiments in Toccata, when any good piano player can do it so much better? (in case you don't know, Ginastera's work is originally for piano).<br />Many people felt really bad when the disco craze came and swept away most of the icons of dinosaur rock, like these guys. In retrospect, I guess the Bee Gees didn't look that bad in comparison.
0790733900|5.0|newman (old blue eyes) stars as cool hand luke jackson, a war hero, who gets himself in trouble with the law, and is repeatedly beaten both mentally and physically savagely by the main boss of the prison he is in. <br />the main boss hates luke for several reasons: everyone likes luke. he is the typical rebel , yet he has a certain aura around that people love. even the people working in the prison like luke.  the boss also hates luke, because he keeps escaping out of prison, which makes the prison's security and himself look bad.  the movie from beginning to end, is one of the entertaining and powerful movies by newman. throughout the movie, we see luke's exploits including his status as &quot;cool hand&quot; which basically says that he can do anything. there is no better scene that shows this that luke's bet that can he eat 50 eggs in one hour. this scene is terrific and humorous to watch, time and time again. george kennedy plays greg dragline, luke's best friend and prison inmante.  dragline's love of luke is evident through the whole movie. whenever, luke is mistreated dragline is there to try to pick up his spirits. whenever, luke is beaten severely for trying to escape the prison, dragline is one of the first friends that is there to pick him up and attend to him.  then of course, this oscar worthy film has the memorable tunes and lines that all audiences all familiar with: <br />&quot;what we got here is a familiar to communicate&quot; is paul newman, legendary and household line that critics and audiences remember. this line has also been used in over a hundred, movies and tv shows including comedies, crime drama movies and much more. the line is a piece of cult phenomena and america which symobolizes a bad situation. <br />paul newman was nominated for best actor for this film, but didn't win.  newman over his career has been nominated over 10 times for this aw ard: &quot;Cat On A Hot Tin Roof&quot; , &quot;Malice&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;, are several of the great movies that NewMan has been nominated for.  &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; stands as one of the American movies ever made. It represents the abusive and mistreatment that a couple of prisons have.  It also represents an intelligent and popular fellow who all through his life had one bad situation after another, yet like Greg points &quot;Ah Luke, always had that great smile.&quot;  Luke's character in a way is a reflection on individuals like himself, whose life have been filled with pain and aggravation yet people like these never give up. Taken from a novel by Donn Pearce and directed by Stuart Rosenberg this film  is a bonified classic.

The title track on Tarkus is really, really interesting -well-crafted, well-played, difficult to classify music.<br />The rest is a mix of leftover King Crimson ballads, Emerson's terrible jams and Palmer showing off everything you can do with a set of drums (not necessarily what a good musician would do). Oh, well.
B000069I3K|5.0|not many films survive the tests of time, it takes a special film to perservere through <BR>the years and still be regarded as one of the best film of all time (rebel without a cause). <BR>a typical film becomes just a fad, a film that is in , but after a couple of months, <BR>becomes regarded as a bad horrible (like the remake of dawn of the dead). however, <BR>e.t. is one of those special films that has proven itself to be just that special, regarded <BR>as being as one of the best of all time, not just in sci fi lingo but overall one of the best <BR>films ever. in 2002, it underwent a major rerealease in it's 20th anniversay edition, <BR>adding in deleted scenes, a change in the film (eliminating guns from scenes) <BR>and a special edition dvd commerating the release. <br />so what makes e.t. special? obviously scifi fans love aliens movies,all audiences do,but <BR>no the is another movie that deals with the idea of friendship and sacrifices between <BR>to completely different beings. e.t. who is stranded on earth, a violent planet that loves <BR>to disects alien species, and elliot the kind hearted human who takes in e.t. protects <BR>him from the outside world and develops a special bond with the alien. by the <BR>end of the film whatever misconceptions, audiences had about e.t. are are left by the curb, <BR>e.t. shows us that e.t. while being an alien feels and hurts just like earthlings do. unlike <BR>other aliens e.t. doesn't come to earth to conquer it, but to make new friends and get <br />help in reaching his homeworld (like alf from planet melmac). <br />well it took, a lot of work getting to the screen. model sets, a special effects team, <BR>a mulitmillion dollar budget and of course steven spielberg. what other director <BR>would have done e.t.? none probably, that's whats separates spielberg from <BR>other directors, often doing good movies that other stupid directors pass over and <BR>ultimately making fools of them by making great movies. <br />Themovie begins with E.T.'s spaceship landing on a forest with his friends. It seems <BR>the spaceship has made an unexpected stop to make repairs. However when a pair <BR>of government agents enter the scene, E.T. buddies leave him behind, leaving <BR>the helpless E.T. to fend for himself. Eventually E.T. is rescued by Elliot <BR>(Henry Thomas). However, he keeps his discovery of E.T. a secret from his family. <BR>Eventually Gertie (Drew Barrymore) and Michael (Robert MacNaughton) Elliot's <BR>brother and sister find out about E.T. but they too love E.T. and see he poses <BR>no threat even though he is an alien. Elliot's mother , Mary (Dee Wallace Stone) <BR>finds out about E.T. as well but it seems that the whole family loves E.T. However <BR>, the fun doesnt last because a couple of government agents and scientists <BR>kidnap both E.T. and Elliot. They then proceed to do scientific expirement and prepare <BR>to disect E.T. thus kiling him. Well E.T. isn't ready to die just yet, it seems he and <BR>Elliot now share a physical bond, whatever E.T. feels Elliot feels and vice versa. <br />Elliot with help from his brother and sister now prepare to escape from the government <BR>facility with E.T. and send E.T. to his own world. Elliot's other friends enter the <BR>picture and well in one memorable scenes where it looks like they all will be captured, <BR>E.T. unleashes one of his special powers , the ability to control fight, as scene <BR>in that famous bicycle flying scenes. <br />E.T. became one of the highest grossing films of all time, becoming a favorite for <BR>both kids and adults. <br />After the 2002 rerealease the marketing campaign for E.T came back, games, toys <BR>and books featuring the Extra Terrestial came back and did very well. <br />This is a must see classic especially if you haven't seen the movie for a long <BR>time. <br />Recommended.
B000002J1O|2.0|Well, the fact that so much of the early 70s prog rock music sucks sure doesn't help.<br />Man, this is bad music. &quot;Bad&quot;, like in overhyped, overplayed, overstated... everything is inflated about this album. And no, it is nowhere near classical music, no matter how many harpsichord and lute sounds you make. Thanks God (for Genesis as a group) Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett eventually left the band -but you had to wait until Duke to really see the results.
B00006879E|4.0|I bought this CD after hearing &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; &amp; &quot;This Love&quot; (like most people). The remainder of the album is great, too, but I would've preferred more songs like the aforementioned -- songs with a distinct, funky beat fused with melodic jazz rhythms. It's good, but I'm hoping their next release is packed with more exceptional songs.
B000002LGQ|4.0|20 years from now, Madonna will be remembered for... er, let me think. The Material Girl video? No way. The steel cone bras... nah. Her Evita dress, who was Evita again? The good thing is, some people will actually remember her for having crafted a pretty decent album, Like a Prayer.<br />Too bad she decided to change Patrick Leonard for that techno-synth guy Orbit. Or maybe Leonard got tired of working with her. In any case, Like a Prayer is her only real good album -well, True Blue is not too bad either.
B00002Z88D|4.0|the audio is clear and it bring you to the concert. It is one of the best cds I have heared and for the dumb asses that did not like it, well I don't care.
B00007KWHN|2.0|And they all love this album!<br />What do you get when you put together a bunch of guys with good technical music background, no talent as composers and a vague common interest on world peace, oriental wisdom and saving the whales?<br />You get exactly this, The Yes Album. If you add overinflated egos after a few years of succesful albums, what you get is Topographic Oceans. But by the time they did The Yes Album they were relatively unknown -and that is what saves the thing to a certain point.
B00009V7P8|5.0|If you enjoy good music...you'll enjoy this.  Damien Rice has a voice that will put you in a trance.  His amazing control over the acoustic guitar is uncanny.  The album is very well put together and not like anything I've ever heard...it's pretty great.
B00007LTIA|1.0|... who bought the album thinking it was the crowning achievement of prog rock. Let's face it, it contains a couple minutes of good music and a lot -and I mean A LOT- of ambientish-guitarish-synthish garbage. If you can stay awake through the whole darn thing, you should really cut on caffeine! Poor Mr. Wakeman, I can understand his frustration over this pitiful thing. &quot;Can we just cut the 15 minutes guitar solo a bit, Steve?&quot; &quot;Shut up and go back to your Minimoog, Rick!&quot;
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Lately a lot of folks have been trying to do stripped down, back to basics, blues based garage rock, with mixed results to say the least.  Somehow this little puppy smokes 'em ALL.  While the treble is tinny, somehow it burns, the drums keep coming fast and loose, and the vocals are truly possessed.  It has the brattyness of early Cramps or Violent Femmes, and the surreal snottiness of prime Ween, mixed with the body rockin potential of Andre Williams or John Spencer Blues explosion.  All that said, I STILL haven't done this weird little sucker justice...  JUST FREAKIN' BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!!!!!!
B000002J2F|5.0|So it's 1980, prog rock is not cool anymore, and everybody is trying to score a disco hit, or become a spiked-hair neo punk band, or do some of that Jamaican stuff (reggae, is it called?). You are Genesis, your star singer is long gone, and your not-so-star guitarist is gone too. What do you do?<br />A great album it seems.<br />I couldn't care less whether this album has &quot;commercial&quot; music in it. I do know it is good music -and that suffices for me. Whether it was recorded in ABBA's Swedish studios or not, well, duh. These three guys had talent, and once they realized they didn't need to play twenty minutes of ever-changing riffs to be good (yeah, this is for Tony Banks), they moved to a different -better- dimension.<br />This album is sooooo much better than any of the old 70's Genesis previous works. Gone is the need to impress, welcome are the steady rhythms, the bass pulse, and Phil Collins' natural sense to score big hits. Hold on a second, how come prog rock stars are allowed to make big bucks too? (and still many old dinosaurs think that way...)
B00005U122|5.0|Let me start by saying I have Pulse, Gilmour In Concert, Delicate Sound of Thunder and Live in Venice and none of these are even in the ballpark of In the Flesh Live. That is not to say the others aren't good dvd's but Roger Waters is far above the rest. He didn't have the light and lazer show that Pink Floyd still does but all that does is make him focus more on the music and he did. Waters was in peak form. Being from Austin I have seen Doyle Bramhall II and his dad many times but he was at his best that night as was Snowy White. I didn't miss Gilmour at all.<BR>After all it was Eric Clapton who called on Doyle to work with him and BB King as soon as he finished the In the Flesh tour. The sound is increadable the band very tight and a minimal of theatrics which were not needed. If I had it do to over the only Pink Floyd or Gilmour dvd I would have bought would have been Pulse. Owning In the Flesh makes the other offerings irrelevent. This is a must have dvd for any Pink fan and it clearly shows who was the creative force in the original band. To end on I will say I am a big David Gilmour fan and a better guitar player is hard to find but check out Doyle and Snowy on In the Flesh and you will see Roger never missed a beat from Gilmour not being there.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|'Master and commander' is one of those spectacular films that now comes along rarley. i think its a brilliant film and put it up with films such as the 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy because its amazing! the graphics are cool and the special effects rule. much better than 'Pirates Of The Caribbean'.(...)
B0001IN07Q|4.0|Michael has had a few cds out since his debut album, and this is definitely the best one since. Totally Buble, was something he didn't want released, and was only a dissappointing 20 minutes long. His Christmas album was annoying short. This is a bit longer and has a few new songs, but the live recording is done so badly. At one point of Mack the Knife the music stops entirely, then a second or two later you can hear Michael faintly start to sing. It gets loud and really soft at times. Dvd on the other hand is actually quite good. I liked the behind the scene moments and interviews, he's a very funny/corny and charming young man. Even though there are some dissappoints on this new cd/dvd I think it's worth it. I just love hearing him sing Nice 'n Easy, and of course every other song he sings. It truly is a magical experience.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is simply one of the best shows ever put on TV. The dialouge and character interaction is only matched on the first few seasons of The West Wing. FOX triumphed in hamstringing the show and not giving it any chance of working. The DVD set is great, all the episodes are in wide screen and it feels like watching movie after movie. The special features are great, especially Joss Whedon's comments during many of the episodes. A must own for anyone who is a fan of things that don't suck. Also, buy it to get pumped for the movie based on the show titled &quot;Serenity.&quot; The movie starts filming in June 2004 and should be out summer 2005.
B00005YW4H|4.0|This is a great album for relaxing. Norah Jones as a great voice and all the songs on this album is very mellow. My favourites are The Nearness of You and One Flight Down. If you're a fan of Michael Buble or Josh Groban, you may like Norah Jones as well. Norah Jones' jazz style is complementary to both Michael Buble and Josh Groban.
B00006V9A0|4.0|From a musical genius and his pioneering band comes this awesome &quot;hit bunch&quot;. I got this solely for their unreleased single because I own all of the other albums. This band stood out like beacon and shines rather brightly till today. Today we remember Kurt on his 10th Death Anniversary and I shall just headbang to the way I did in the 90's to the anthem which still &quot;....smells like teen spirit!&quot;<br />A definite addition to your Nirvana collection.<br />Rest In Peace Kurt. You are missed.
B000088E6D|5.0|I've been a Michael Buble fan for very nearly a year, and I think it's impossible to get tired of hearing his wonderful voice. He is such a fantastic singer. His singing style is very Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin-like, yet he has his own touch. He is even better live! This is a great cd. It's a MUST HAVE for your own cd collection. BUY IT NOW! You won't regret it!
0385507755|5.0|There is just something hypnotically compelling about reading about people with seemingly every advantage (good family, money, celebrity, success) throwing it all away as they figuratively jump out of the airplane without a parachute to chase after the beer they dropped. It's like watching a train wrecks and Kobe trials on television. You just can't look away. In the tradition of Rikki Lee Travolta's &quot;My Fractured Life&quot; and with that same hint of Ken Kesey's &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; is hyper addictive reading about the ugliness of addiction that we can enjoy in safety.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is a classic. Still, I'm finding it difficult to write a review that can express just how truly exceptional this album is for several reasons: first, I usually list stand-out tracks in my review. This simply can't be done with Nevermind, because quite frankly, every track is a masterpiece. Second, I'm not sure what exactly you'd call this record. Is it simply a rock record? Is it a pop record? Is it simply grunge, and nothing more? The fact is this album truly rocks, but there's nothing especially alienating about it, so it's also a pop record. And of course, this album has come to define grunge itself. In the end, it probably doesn't matter. If you haven't heard any of Nirvana's music, chances are you have been dead for some time. I'd get that checked out if I were you. Anyway, if you like anything you've heard by Nirvana even remotely, I can promise you that you'll love this entire album. And don't be fooled by the negative reviews. Even a classic album isn't for everyone (is there a single record in the entire world that is universally loved because I can't think of one). Fact is, this is one of the greatest albums ever made, and the only proof I can offer is that 14 years after it's release, it's still hugely popular. I still hear kids listening to Nirvana, and the band has never left my CD player for an extended period. This is the album of the 90's and thus far, nothing to come along in the 00's can dethrone it.
B0001611DI|4.0|&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is a great film no matter how you look it.  Good characters, and Goblin's music is awesome.  For those of you yet to see the remake, keep a sharp eye open for a pleasant little surprise of Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger.
B00008H2LB|1.0|First, let me just say that I normally don't review albums by bands I don't like. This is because these reviews are meant to help people in determining if an album is for them or not, and thus, the opinion of someone opposed to the band isn't going to be helpful. <br />Still, I just have to critisize this album. I'm sick of hearing the singles on the radio, and in people's CD players. This madness must be stopped!! Okay, I'll take a breath. This album sounds EXACTLY like Hybrid Theory. Sadly, it sounds even more like their first album than their remake of their first album did. I have to give this band credit for releasing the same songs over and over again with different names, and somehow selling records. You know there's no real talent when a band releases a remix record immediately following their debut and then creates an exact copy of said album and slaps a different name on it. <br />If you like Linkin Park, that's fine. Buy one of their albums. But please don't buy more than one, because one is all you need because there's no difference between the albums. By buying multiple versions of the same thing, you're only encouraging them to produce more of the exact same garbage. Demand more!<br />Oh, and by the way, yes I noticed that I repeated myself many times in this review. I basically said the same thing over and over again. I couldn't quite get away with blatantly repeating myself, I guess. Funny how it works for some people.
B000002LKF|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time, in part because it is one of a few albums that demands to be played as a complete set of music.  From start to end, the combination of the tunes, lyrics, pace of the cuts and flow of the songs create a mood unlike any other.  After repeated listenings over a twelve year period, I have never grown tired of album that is clearly more sophisticated than Graceland, its predicessor.  The sound quality is very good.  The album can be listened to explicitly, or turned on in the background.  With respect to the other reviewers, it's not &quot;like&quot; anything else.  It stands alone.
B000003TAR|4.0|This album is pretty much a five star album, but I'm giving it four because there are a couple of weak tracks.<br />When I first heard this album, I didn't really care for it that much. The songs (with a couple of exceptions) were not ones you could hear and immediately love like those on Nevermind. However, I gave this album more than one shot (because I think a lot of music gets better with repeat listens) and found that many of the songs really grew on me. Some have held up much better over the years than anything on Nevermind.<br />The album opens with &quot;Serve the Servants&quot; which is a pretty easy listen and an excellent track. It then moves on to &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot; which upon first listen, seemed awful. There's just something weird about Kurt Cobain's screaming in this track. It doesn't sound like anything else I've heard. Eventually, that became part of this track's charm. &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot; is the third track, and one of the album's bigger hits. It's easy to see why. One of the poppier tracks on the album, this track would have fit nicely with Nevermind. This is one of Nirvana's best singles. Over the years, I've grown tired of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; but still love this one. &quot;Rape Me&quot; is an anti-rape song, which everyone knows now, but at one point caused contraversy. Great song, the riff is a little too similar to the one in &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; though, but I think that was intentional. &quot;Frances Farmer Shall Have Her Revenge on Seattle&quot; is another excellent tune. I don't think it was a single, but it easily could have been. &quot;Dumb&quot; and &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; are both fine tracks, though not favorites. &quot;Milk It&quot; and &quot;Radio Friendly Unit Shifter&quot; are moreless filler, as is &quot;Very Ape.&quot; But the closing number, &quot;All Apologies&quot; is one of the finest songs you'll ever hear. Great lyrics by Cobain, powerful delivery. All in all is all we are. <br />An important album, one of the most important of the 90's, even if it ultimately never achieved quite the status of Nevemind.
B000063COX|5.0|Ahhh...a very familiar beginning to one of metal's most revered giants. Iron Maiden was, is and always will be absolutely legendary for many reasons and this album is a perfect reason why: because with the release of this lone, self-titled album, they were one of the select few bands who were to usher in the new era of rock music. They were the bridge. While Led Zepellin was ending due to the death of John Bonham, Black Sabbath was gonig through a roster change, Kiss was toying around with the sounds of disco and 70s rock was being shown the door, Iron Maiden came along with a sound that embraced both the sounds of the bands that influenced them such as Jethro Tull and Yes while adding the aggressiveness of punk and early heavy metal and the result was the phenom that is their self-titled debut. Blending a healthy mix of the sounds of Pink Floyd and Black Sabbath along with their own now-famous trademark style, Iron Maiden laid the foundation for an alter that would be worshipped at for years to come.<br />Much like Iron Maiden's entire 1980's catalog recordings, there isn't a whole lot of music that would ring a bell with your average rock radio afficienado but any loyal Maiden fan, the gems are many and to this day, still round out Maiden's live tracklist. Songs like &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and the absolute masterpiece &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; (which I contend to be one of the best heavy metal songs ever written) are some of the more familiar content that are often found in Maiden's live set but other classics are to be found within as well. &quot;Charlotte The Harlot&quot;, the pre-cursor to TNOTB track &quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot;, is one of my personal favorites along with the very melodic Floyd-esque &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot;. Other songs that have been hailed as metal mainstays amongst Maiden's minions would be &quot;Phantom Of The Opera&quot;, &quot;Running Free&quot; and &quot;Transylvania&quot;.<br />This album, for all intents and purposes, is the beginning of absolute greatness in music. While recent interviews with today's musicians finds the singer from Disturbed praising Iron Maiden as an influence and Kirk Hammett from Metallica (as if his opinion matters) claiming Iron Maiden to be no longer relevant, ask any Iron Maiden fan and it is near unanimous what the ultimate verdict will be. Iron Maiden are as legendary as Led Zepellin, Black Sabbath and The Beatles and this album was responsible for starting it all. Up the Irons, indeed.ing of absolute greatness in music.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|In truth- after watching the very first episode of this BIZARRE set up (Western Themed Sci-fi?!) you will be stunned- speachless even, at how great this series was. By the time I got to the 3rd disk I was enraged at how STUPID the network was that let this go.  Trust me- if you have never seen Firefly, even if you aren't a Sci-Fi fan (both of which qualify me to write this) you will LOVE this show. Every episode was like a mini-movie and the characters were beyond description. The stories are as well written as novels and the special effects were better than anything you see on TV today- but without a doubt, it's the characters.<br />Whereas most TV shows put cliche' characters in 'pounded-to-death' situations, these guys played these roles as if they were the first EVER to pull it off. The 'rouge pilot on the run' the 'cute girl mechanic' the 'out for himself soldier'- all these cliche's are done just PERFECTLY!! You will watch these all too short 14 episodes over and over and over again. It's worth twice the asking price and you'd still love to pay for it once you traveled aboard the Firefly.
0790729725|5.0|Scorsese knocks one out of the park with Goodfellas.  A true story of gangster Henry Hill and his wild ride with the Mafia.  Stellar performances by Deniro, Liotta, Brocca,  and last but not least Joe Pesci.  Pesci is incredible as gangster Tommy Devito and won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.<br />  Truly one of the greatest gangster movies of all time....its not to be missed.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The Wachowski brothers deliver a third straight knockout punch with this big-budget tech thriller. What can they possibly do to top this? A clue might be offered by Vernor Vinge, who invented the concept of cyberspace in his short story True Names. On the back cover of the new tech thriller NANO by John Robert Marlow, Vinge says: &quot;Could make a spectacular movie. Wachowski brothers, watch out!&quot; Rumor is they may do this book next...
B00003CXPD|3.0|do what you love, that's the movie.  have known it for 15 years.  been there, done that.  please show me something new.
B00009V7RF|4.0|A feel good hip hop album that sounds good? To attempt to do this is heresy to many so called fans of hip hop. Breaking the stereotype that hip hop has to be overly concerned with either being a drug dealer or a &quot;underground&quot; rapper who spits about growing up with drug dealers, BEP prove that you dont have to keep to this formula to be considered good. The beats are great and the lyrics are fun (reminiscent of de la soul's 3ft high) and not obsessed with &quot;war stories&quot; like much of todays popular hip hop artist. I must admit I hate &quot;Latin Girls&quot; (not personally). It's suppose to be a shout out to latinas but it sounds more like a conditioned mind for those of you who know what I'm talking about. The only really dissappointing moment. I love latin girls too (NY is full of boriquas) but I would never just shout them out in an album. They should have given the big up to the other Queens, African American girls, who are some of their biggest fans. Anyway, outside of this anti-brownskin lady by Blackstar track, I thought the album was refreshingly good. Alot of people say it's weak but thats only the ones conditioned to believe that hip hop must be obsessed with the streets in order to be &quot;real&quot;. Break through. Elephunk will phunk you up.
B000089CJI|5.0|postal service has a unique sound. They are nice to just sit around and chill too. They have a sound similar to emo/soothing techno. Over that past few months since i first heard them they have become one of my all time favorite bands. I would recomend them to anybody.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I begrudgingly accept this as a superior cut. The mixes are outstanding. The digital remastering was done properly. I have no problem with the modified track listing. I suppose some listeners who have imprinted the original into their DNA will recoil. The discography, graphics and title are truly absurd, but that's not what it's really about. <br />The 'new' sunshine organ break on 'The Long and Winding Road' is glorious. I could at last hear the electric piano texture on 'I Dig a Pony'. This version of 'Across the Universe' is really, really good. Astounding. The full length version of 'Dig It' would have been interesting I suppose, but unnecessary. <br />The much disliked bonus disc can be thrown away, but I hear it as a humorous document. A bonus disc of practice takes from the film, like the wah-wah version of 'Don't Let Me Down' etc.. would have been a better idea for fanatics, who compose the market for this release. Someone here suggested that the photo of the band on the stairs from 1969 would have made a decent cover, and I would agree.
B0000A02U2|1.0|About a dozen reviewers were able to be honest with themselves and say this movie was not funny at all. Like a David Lynch movie, or Sun Tzu's Art Of War, it must be one of those things you have to pretend that you &quot;get&quot; so you can be cool. I dunno, maybe its just dated. Just because someone says its a classic doesnt mean you are compelled to laugh, though.
B00005JMSE|2.0|(...)The dialogue was stupid and the ending was just so overused that I wanted to throw something at the screen. But, overall, the movie was just boring. They tried really really hard. The special effects were top-notch, the cast was generally good (although their talents weren't used very well), and they at least tried to have a underlying moral message at the end. But the plot wasn't, well, INTERESTING enough.<br />There's some action, a love story, and the average joe will probably be entertained enough to spend the $8-10. The violence isn't too bad for younger kids, and most teenagers will probably get a kick out of the action sequences. Adults might appreciate some of the humor (though it is used sparingly and not always with success). Just don't expect X-Men or Spiderman.
6304341849|5.0|This is an exceptional film, the production quality was great and the acting was outstanding. It was romantic, dark, passionate and eye opening. The story is about two men who find that they are in love with each other at a time that such things are not done.( Makes you thankful for the progress we have made in learning to accept diversity.) One accepts his love and the other fights it. As time passed they change and the twist at the end inspires hope and sadness at the same time. This is an emotional film and you will be drawn in, you will feel the story and be moved by it. Without question this is a great addition to your collection and a sound investment.
B00006879E|5.0|Okay, okay, I admit it. I'm not amazingly hard to please when it comes to my music collection. As long as it's not rap (i.e. i understand what's being said), and the beat or lyrics are relatively catchy, I'm a happy girl. But when my friend bought me Songs About Jane for my birthday, I was blown away! I instantly fell in love with this band and their funky style. This cd rarely leaves my stereo. I'm especially enamored with &quot;She will be Loved,&quot; &quot;This Love,&quot; &quot;Must Get Out,&quot; &quot;Tangled,&quot; and &quot;Shiver.&quot; This is a must buy for anyone who's a fan of Matchbox 20, Jason Mraz, or John Mayer. I really highly recommend checking out Maroon 5 , and some of their old records when they were known as Kara's Flowers.
B000127LW2|5.0|Okay, why did I bother to buy Season One of Star Trek Voyager.  I loved the first Star Trek and Next Generation.  Unfortunately I live in the country and only got a Fox signal on good summer days so I only ever saw a handful of Voyager episodes.  They were all self-contained and well done.<br />So I bought this to see if I'd been missing anything.  I was!  The first season introduced the premise and the characters and I got that tingle that you only get from watching a really good Star Trek series.  Story lines were great and were as good as any from Next Generation.  I'm seeing more episodes now from this box than I ever got to see when it was on the air and believe me it's held up well.<br />Will I be buying subsequent releases?  You bet your ass!
B00012FXB8|4.0|Like many out there I saw the third in the series as an interesting but flawed work.  Rest assured, with this special edition we get the film that should've been released a decade ago.  Wow!  This film is amazing and quite beutiful.  It's very much a Fincher film, but also very un-American.  This film is elegiac, morose, down-beat, and melancholic.  Also, it deals with morality, mortality, and redemption and/vs. sacrifice.  So no wonder it didn't do well with American audiences!  Of course Europeans and Asians having seen wars decimate their populations not too long ago (WWI, WWII, Korean War, Vietnam, etc.) could understand the tone and appreciate the beauty.  This film isn't so much about the Alien as much as it's about people facing the end of their existences (the alien is sort of a metaphor for God I think).  Its got more in common (tone and theme wise) to Tarkovsky's 'THE SACRIFICE' than it does to any of the other alien films.  At any rate, get this version, see the film as it was meant to be seen (sans compromises), and appreciate it for the great film it is!<br />(BTW, I'm giving it 4 stars not 5 because the alien effects are slightly dated...but other than that, it's about perfect!)
B0001BKAEE|5.0|The story of the Matrix trilogy is a wondrous one; in fact the most wondrous of all stories as it is the story of human enlightenment. It is the mythic story of the traditions - east and west. It's a map of a territory, the ultimate territory, the territory of Self. The Matrix trilogy, like all myths, is a story that carries its message wrapped in a metaphor. And like all mythic metaphors, the Matrix trilogy can be unpackaged at many levels, with the deeper levels re-presenting the same message with progressive sophistication and meaning. As with all art, that sophistication and meaning can only be appreciated and interpreted in the light of the context (cognitive, emotional, and spiritual) that the viewer brings to the viewing. One aspect of all great mythic traditions is that while the story remains a constant, the context of the one who hears the story is always growing, and consequently the meaning of the message expands with each telling of the tale. One definitely needs to see the Matrix movies many times to truly tune into what is being communicated. In any event, it seems clear that just about everybody brought sufficient contextual awareness to their viewing of the first Matrix to appreciate the story at multiple levels. Beyond the intensity of the sci-fi surface story, everybody, looking from the perspective of virtually any of the spiritual or philosophical traditions, resonated with the story line ideas suggesting that the world as we commonly perceive it, is - in certain important ways - an illusion; therefore - wake up! <BR>Unfortunately, Reloaded and Revolutions have not (thus far) faired as well; but this is only because much of the general public (and almost all of the professional reviewers) didn't look deep enough into the rabbit hole. The fact that the surface sci-fi story in Reloaded/Revolutions seems burdened for some viewers must be considered a failing of sorts for these movies because the very best mythic stories work for everyone, at leaston the surface, even on the first pass. Clearly, Reloaded / Revolutions has not worked for everyone, at least not on the surface, and not on the first pass. But these movies do work, and work marvelously if we make the effort and take the time to look below the surface, and keep looking until we see some reflection of what it is that the Wachowski brothers are intending to convey. But they won't tell us - not outright, and for a very good reason. To truly get the Matrix message, you have to see it for yourself. Remember, the Brothers made Bound to prove they could make a movie, and then made the Matrix to gain the leverage to tell the rest of their tale in Reloaded / Revolutions. Does anyone really think that the minds that produced the Matrix could scheme and create for three years and come up with a meaningless message in their sequel? To find the treasure buried in these movies, we need to keep looking. But I have come to the conclusion that the secret of the treasure is hidden in plain view. For those who bring a sufficiently rich awareness of one or more of the religious or philosophical traditions to their viewing, or for those who are willing to just think very deeply about the metaphor as it is presented, Reloaded/ Revolutions will, I can assure you, reveal itself as a satisfying and enlightening conclusion to the spiritual adventure that captured our imagination in the original Matrix.
B00005AR3G|4.0|I am puzzled by the many 5 star glowing reviews this movie received here at amazon.  257 reviews at Yahoo give it a B+ which feels about right.  Its good, but great??  There is a reason this movie wasn't all that successful at the box office.  Its funny at points, and teaches a good lesson for kids.  But its not as funny as classics like Aladin, Toy Story (either) or Monsters Inc to name a few.  And it has only one song, which is fairly forgettable although well done.  Nor does it have gorgeous visuals like the Lion King.  And the movie starts a bit slow -- it doesn't really start to shine until the Emperor gets turned into a Lama, which is almost a 1/2 hour in (may be off by a bit). While the movie has some charm, it doesn't excell in this area the way say, Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc. does.  None of which takes away from the fact that this is a feel good flick worth a watch with kids of any age.  No one's parents die and there are no innappropriate aspects for young kids. <br />This *is* a movie adults can enjoy, but I don't have any real desire to watch it again. Much of the humour is physical humour.  More polished then the physical humour in the cartoons we grew up with, but it didn't make me laugh.  At the same time, the movie did have a certain charm, and I wouldn't be unhappy if my daughter wants to put it on.  <br />I can easily see kids enjoying the movie much more then I did.  My daughter didn't appeciate it, but she is only 2 and is very picky.<br />Bottom line:  rent or tape before buying.
B0000DZTIL|4.0|This film is noteworthy because it is just so 80s and they just don't make them like this any more. I thought the time-space warp idea was used very effectively for a totally off the wall experience. I suppose you may have to have a pretty objective sense of humor to enjoy this film, however, don't judge it too harshly.
B000099T2L|1.0|Sorry Beyonce.  I found this CD very immature, and that is suprising coming from a girl like Beyonce.
B0000025T6|5.0|I always preferred when artists go acoustic, and record a low-quality album. Albums like Nebraska capture an artist at their most intimate. This was Bruce Springsteen's stark, low-key acoustic record. It was very dreary, as it was beautiful. His tales of suffering and being on the wrong side of the law was profound and you can feel it in his howl and his singing. He already had the reputation of being a high-energy, bombastic satdium act but Nebraska captured him in a whole new light. It was more reserved than Born to Run, and it had more personality than many of his albums. Songs like &quot;Atlantic City,&quot; &quot;State Trooper,&quot; and &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot; send chills down my spine, whereas other songs like &quot;Nebraska,&quot; &quot;My Father's House&quot; and &quot;Used Cars&quot; express Springsteen in a more vulnerable, yet very striking voice, particularly Nebraska's tale of a serial killer. Even non-fans of The Boss can appreciate this album for its sense of intimacy and depth. Springsteen would never be this bare after this album, although certain subsequent works do show his profound side (particularly Tunnel of Love and the Rising).
0553582445|5.0|i picked this book up recently on recommendation -- i believe it says in one of these reviews that this is a good starting point for robin hobb... but it's not, really.  <br />now don't get me wrong, the book is fantastic!  hobb's main character, fitz, is a brooding, scarred, untrusting anti-hero who will somehow charm the socks off of you, as will his capering counterpart, the fool.  her prose is elegant but straightforward, and her plot is imaginative but realistic.  i've read too many boring, derivative fantasy novels, which always irritate me because it's fantasy -- you can write about anything in the entire universe!  and yet so many writers seem determined to emulate some sort of tired old formula.  reading this book, however, will remind you of how amazing a well-written fantasy can be.<br />my complaint, and my warning to new readers, is this: don't start here, no matter what the amazon reviews say.  this series, &quot;the tawny man&quot;, is the sequel to another series, &quot;the farseer&quot;.  not realizing this, i started with this book, and it took me a while to get into it.  the first few chapters mainly deal with old friends meeting after 15 years apart, and talking about other people they know.  it's a bit like being at a really fun party where you don't know anyone -- you're having a good time, but you have no idea what anyone's talking about, so you just stand in a corner clutching your drink and waiting for someone to include you.  so start with &quot;assassin's apprentice&quot;, not with this book.<br />of course, read this one after you finish that series -- it's truly worth it.
B000002LEM|5.0|make NO mistake, this is a stellar rock effort. while there are some fillers here, its worth the price alone for feels so good, cabo wabo, and afu, you can almost see the white sands and sunny beaches in eddies sound on this particular album. highly listenable and enjoyable, and an overall good feeling album. its not as earth shaking as some of thier previous efforts, but then this album doesn't really set out to be. and keeping things in perspective, even a less than earth shattering van halen album such as this is still far and away more creative and enjoyable an album than most other rock band's crowning efforts. five star rating. (and for those who haven't quite figured out the meaning in the title, as there seems to be a few of you here who haven't including daniel durchholz' editorial review,shame on you, try looking at some of diamond dave's albums around the same time frame.) ;)
0385504209|3.0|Yes, that is the fantastic premise of The DaVinci Code.  Dan Brown very cleverly mingles fact with fiction to create a highly suspenseful thriller about a super secret society dedicated to protecting an explosive revelation about Jesus and his relationship with Mary Magdalene.  But the incredible fascination over whether the premise of this work of fiction is true is very disturbing.  It's just a story, folks.  In the same way that the Left Behind series is nothing but a highly dubious fictionalized &quot;prediction&quot; of the Apocalypse, the DaVinci Code is just a fun read when your brain is tired.  But don't make anything more of it than that.  Please.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Perhaps it is unfair to simply label Jet as a garage rock band. After all, this album holds a lot more variety than say, The White Stripes' Elephant does, or either of the The Strokes' albums. But unlike the Stripes, who manage to make great blues based rock and roll despite having a trained monkey on drums, Jet just sounds like 15 bad cover bands rolled all into one gigantic crappy supergroup. <br />Are You Gonna Be My Girl is the song that is currently garnering radio airplay, not to mention all sorts of critical acclaim. Call me crazy, but I liked this song better when it was called Lust For Life and Iggy Pop was singing it. Is this what is passing as &quot;quality rock&quot; right now? There's nothing better out there than this? Or are people just that eager to eat whatever radio craps out as &quot;the next big thing?&quot; Cause I'll tell you, Are You Gonna Be My Girl is only the beginning of the suckage and unoriginality to be found on this disc. <br />The only thing that is bearable on this entire album is Rollover D.J., which while as derivative as the rest of the album, at least has a big fun chorus attached to it, and some nice jangly guitar rhythms. Alas, other than this, its all downhill.
0385504209|1.0|As an English teacher, people always want to tell me what they've been reading as of late. Many, MANY people offered up that &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is sheer brilliance, and could not be put down.  Several, in fact, testified that they haven't read a book cover-to-cover in decades, until this novel entered their lives.  Is that something to brag about?<br />This novel was written for somebody who does not enjoy reading anything with substance. It is the literary equivalent of a poorly written action TV show.  Hence, it keeps the attention of preteens and dullards, while ignoring character development.  All three of the 'major' characters in this novel are simply named different things.  They all act basically the same, and nowhere does the protagonist Robert Langdon say or do anything befitting a 'renowned Harvard symbologist.&quot;<br />This novel is just such claptrap. It's depressing, because there was a time that Americans could follow something that had a little depth to it.  Should I be glad that Americans are reading at all?  To tell the truth, not if it's this filth.  A poorly told story cannot be compensated because it is flashy or has shocking ideas about religion.<br />It's true that I could not put this book down...for at least the two hours it took to read.  How can a 500 page book take so little time to read unless it has absolutely no serious content.  Stick it in the children's literature section. Just don't tell most adults that they have the equivalent intelligences of American children fifty years ago.
B000000LZV|5.0|s p i e l ---<br />this is IT.  when i'm hunting for art, books, music, etc, i'm always searching for something that speaks to me, something with heart soul &amp; life ---<br />this is one of those rare works that i always come back to - i burned out my cassette version years ago (you won't get this on the cd or album: on the tape the revving car engine is synchronized so that when you hear it, you can flip the tape and there's another - right before my favorite - A Political Song For Michael Jackson To Sing.) They cover Van Halen &amp; Steely Dan - these guys could cover any song and make it their own. They also introduced me to Raymond Pettibon's work - his drawings on the liner notes for this and other minutemen albums are amazing. <br />This album still blows me away - hilarious fierce ridiculous intelligent beautiful ALIVE - thank you Minutemen !!!
B0001KL5DA|5.0|This is one of the smartest shows on television, and Season 2 is no exception.  Much of the action is paced slower than Seasons 1 and 3, but it's still an incredible season that focuses on Nate's secret illness, the relationship between David and Keith, and Brenda's...um...new hobbies.  I don't understand why it took over 2 years for Season 2 to be released, but I'm glad it's finally coming out, and I hope Season 3 won't be far behind.  (I wish the cover of the Season 2 DVD set was a bit more unique, though...I loved the corpse/lipstick image used for Season 1, and I think they could have come up with something a bit more creative instead of just slapping the standard logo on there, but oh well.)
B000001F3C|5.0|I was 18 when this album came out and I can still remember seeing the video for New Year's Day when it hit MTV (back when they showed mostly videos... imagine that!). The video was as stripped down and raw as the music and this album stands as a reminder of our political climate at the time. I was just entering college and U2 couldn't have come along at a better time. While most of the country was conforming to the Reagan 80's and conservatism, it's albums like this that assured me that I was not going to be a follower. Can you imagine an album today that had such a powerful political stance? The current administration would condemn it as a threat to our western civilization and I'm sure the musicians would be labled as being terrorists sympathizers. It's too bad that no one has the balls to tell it like it is anymore in mainstream music. Maybe that's why most of it sucks.  <br />U2 is supposedly coming out with a stripped down new album this year that prominantly features The Edge's raw guitar sound . Let's just hope Bono found the inspiration to write a few edgy lyrics to go along with it. Then again, Bono is so focused on eventually taking Kofi Annan's job I doubt he'll destroy his future politcal ambitions through politcally charged rock lyrics. Oh how I miss great rock musicians before they became so rich and famous... VBG
B0000DD7NL|5.0|You have got talent sista!! i love alicia keys!! her songs are not upbeat, they are wonderful!! i love this cd, and i hope you pick it. Songs In A Minor is another great cd from alicia. plz check it out. and think about buying it, you won't regret it! she produces, and sings, and writes her own songs, do you know how hard that is to do?? this 23 yr old, is not only beautiful, but has a wonderful voice, and spirit. thank you!
B00008ADPF|5.0|This group has made some excellent music. The one track that stands out is Someday.<br />So many garbage reviews from obvious biased haters who want to force their music opinions on one another. Watch out for those punk, heavy metal fans who hate any other genre especially when it comes to rock music.
B00018D44U|5.0|This is my second review of Norah's great Follow up cd &quot; Feels Like Home&quot;.  I had not intended to write a second review of the same cd. What prompted me to do so was reading all the ill contrived one star reviews posted by people who lack any real appreciation for the better things in life.. In rightful defense of this cd and the deserved reputation it had garnished I wish to mock all evident trifles from those who have no musical taste, namely one star reviewers. It's clear to me that these above-mentioned folks either do not understand good music or have been brought up and seduced by junk pop culture and it's music. Not only are these one star reviews quite poor but they offer no valid reason or intelligible cause for such disdain of one Norah Jones.  Not verbatum ofcourse as I don't have the time nor inclination to read anymore one star reviews but here it the common approach to such reviews. Oh, her music puts me to sleep. How can people like her? Her music is so boring and she has no talent.   Ofcourse little is said as to why they do not like her. They do not cite or go into at least modest detail as to the reason but rather digress into such generalities that leave me suspect as to whether or not they actually purchased and fully listened to this cd.. One reviewer, who posted high marks for this cd, made a very good point. He/she said that it is almost political and those who do not like her are trying their best to make sure she &quot; remains uncool&quot; to the masses who fall victim to pop music. I tend to think this is a very good point and one that prompts these one star reviews.  For those of you who enjoy blue-grass, country, jazz, and the blues I have no doubt this cd will appeal to you and that even if some songs are not to your liking others songs will be. Trust me, Norah is cool!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is undoubtebly one of my favorite albums ever, thats what to say about it. Incredible medley of excellent guitar work, kick-ass vocals and the incredible turntable work of Mr.Hahn. I've seen these guys in concert 5 times, and must of bought every piece of Linkin Park merchandise ever marketed, but Meteora beat them all! (well the concerts were pretty hardcore too) In comparison to Hybrid Theory there are some similarities but its like comparing vanilla to chocolate. You go to the score get some vanilla, its damn good. But you wanna try a broader range of the awesome thing that is ice cream. So you try chocolate. Vanilla=Hybrid Theory Chocolate=Meteora<br />Pick this up as soon as possible! Its simply brilliant.<br />The best songs are undoubtebly these.<br />Faint - Literally my favorite song ever. Pulse pounding guitar and epic scope.<br />Somewhere I Belong- Transendent mixing and some nice lyrics, really catchy.<br />Dont Stay - Really really, intense rock. Rather like one step closer where the guitarwork steals the show with pure intensity.<br />All the other songs are great too! Go ahead, its the best album of 2003.
0671027387|5.0|I first read The Da Vinci Code by this author, and was impressed by the extent of his research, although obviously he derived much of his data from Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln. Possibly he also depended upon the research done by Umberto Eco, who wrote The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum, all three of which I have reviewed for Amazon..<br /><br />In any case, whoever was responsible, the research effort was intimidating. And so it is here. It is not uncommon for various authors to use ideas from others to derive their plots. What impresses me is the story they write around their plots. Dan Brown is an impressive storyteller. This book is a zinger!<br />He throws in much in the way of science from divergent disciplines, from oceanography, glaciology, paleontology, astronomy, and vulcanology to name only a few. There are also references to UFOlogy and military technology, including a ton of intelligence methodology and equipment--much new to me (and everyone else outisde the military.) For example: The fabled Aurora jet fighter, and Improved Munitions (IM) weapons, which use ammunition manufactured on the spot from elements of the environment, i.e.: ice bullets from snow. And a flying radio controlled communications device the size of a mosquito that sends televised images back to the operator in real time.<br />The author assures us that all technologies described in the book actually exist, as well as the agencies: the Delta Force, the NRO, and the Space Frontier Foundation, just as did the organizations in The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />This story's protagonist is Rachel Sexton, who writes daily intelligence briefs (gists) for the President of the United States for a living, as an employee of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), an intelligence community function.<br />Sexton's senator father is the leading opposituion candidate for the presidency. His daughter bears hostility toward him because of his past unfaithfulness to her late mother, and his self-centered political ambitions. He has a propensity for attacking NASA, and has made a political football of its failures and cost overruns. His attacks have helped him in the polls, and hurt the President's standing, so when it is announced that a NASA satellite has discovered a large meteorite imbedded in the ice near the arctic circle, and it develops that the rock has apparent fossils of exoskeletal life forms imbedded in it, it is very dood news for NASA and the President.<br /><br />But there are glitches. All is not kosher on the Western Front.<br />This is a complicated plot, but it unfolds easily and is an easy read. With over 550 pages, the book will keep you entertained for a couple of days, anyway, depending of course upon your reading speed and time available to you for recreational reading.<br /><br />Although the plot is convoluted, and the identity of the head \\"bad guy\\" is kept secret until near the end, I enjoyed the book very much. I look forward to the next book by this author.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br /><br />and other booksse of his past unfaithfulness to her late mother, and his self-centered political ambitions.

6305718954|2.0|I thought I would see a very interesting movie which I thought would bring me more in that religious belief and history of stigmata.......but in fact it seemed the story of the movie was short and came back over and over (i.e. The girl goes to her job as a hairdresser, after that she receives the &quot;marks of the crucifiction&quot; then the priest goes to her apartement and wipe her forehead with a wet towel.......than she return to her hairdressing, get stigmata, appartement, wiping forehead...) all that with some differing events, but it seemed all the same and was boring.  The special effects were very well done but we weren't enough in an atmosphere of fear----&gt; angles of camera differing from normal movies could have been used there. <br />One possession scene was captivationg but the others weren't as much, which is why I give it only 2 stars.
6302054982|4.0|This is a more-or-less run-of-the-mill tough guys film directed by the master of the genre, Martin Scorsese.  One thing sets it apart from the other gangbanger films: it is based on fact--the life of Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta), a half Irish, half Sicilian punk from New York City who associated himself with the local mob at an early age.<br /><br />From a run-of-the-mill street punk, Hill graduates into bigger scores, and eventually into dealing drugs.  To save his neck he turns government witness, through the Witness Protection program, and burns everyone who has ever known or been associated with him. The feds get him placed in Seattle with his wife and kids, but once a punk, always a punk.  He falls back into his old patterns, and his wife divorces him and he again gets entangled with the law.<br /><br />All pretty predictable.<br /><br />The big boys that he ratted on end up doing time, of course, and so everthing is made acceptable, except... Somehow, we end up with the feeling that justice has not really been done.  He should have been locked up as well.  At least, that's my reaction.<br /><br />The film is of course well done.  But, I thought the filthy language was overdone and gratuitous.  I think a good film could be made, and still get the idea across, using language more acceptable to a general audience.  You wouldn't want to view this one in company with your mother (or any other person you respected.)  That's too bad.<br /><br />We've come a long way since Gable cussed mildly in Gone With the Wind, and everyone gasped in dismay.  Are we better off now, that nothing is left unsaid anymore?<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books
B00005QG9J|2.0|This album was the one that made Incubus drop off my radar. They where one of my favorite bands up till then. Make Yourself was an enjoyable, catchy album, but it was a harbringer of things to come. Songs like Drive and I Miss You made me worry of Incubus's destiny as a top 40 band. I gave Morning View a chance, but it simply didn't click and I ended up selling it.<br />To be fair, however, there is some good stuff on this album. Circles and Blood on the Ground are catchy rockers, and I particularly like the chilled-out intro to Just A Phase. The eventual song isn't too bad either. Some parts really convey the mellow seaside feeling the band was going for. It's just that there are plenty of the &quot;experiments&quot; Incubus so often speak of that simply do not work. Mexico, for example, is a dull acoustic ballad that could have been something more. And for a band that occasionally sites Pink Floyd as an influence, why write a boring single with the same name as one of that band's best songs?<br />The band is in full form. Mike Enziger is a very respectable guitarist who definitely has progressed....I guess. It's just lately that since he's traded his trademark PRS for a more Garage Rock-ish Fender Jazzmaster for A Crow Left of the Murder he seems to have lost some flair that was so prevalent in the awesome early years. I think the main problem is Brandon Boyd. His vocals have finally gotten to the point of irritating and self indulgent, and this is a guy who I felt was one of the better singers out there at the time. His lyric writings are occasionally witty, but very often silly, dumb and fluffy. Recently, he's taken a poor attempt at political commentary, and overall comes off as sort of a pretentious male diva. I missed when he was like the pot-smoking hippy kid from up the street who you could have deep conversations with.<br />Overall, I think this band has gone down. Incubus have compromised too much of their integrity and musical creativity to be where theyare now. This album wasn't terrible, but not good enough for Incubus's previous standards. I think they'll be well off with the new audience they've gained, but it came at a pretty heavy price.
B000060K4O|5.0|This is one of the greatest,funniest and most successful comedy motion pictures in movie history!! The actors,actresses and the special effects are super remarkable!! I,ve been a huge fan of the movie and cartoon when I was just a kid. I really miss the toys and cartoons but the movie brings it back just like a memory. You,ll enjoy this huge,major movie. It,s absoulutly super terrific!!
B000002UA0|3.0|There are always those shocker debut albums. You know, the ones by bands you like that you pick up without having prior knowledge that they had a different lineup and a completely different sound. Bands that come to mind are Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac, who where a straight ahead all-male British blues band; Iron Maiden, who where much more punk prior to being heavy metal band; Genesis, who where a total prog rock band before becoming a showcase for silly Phil Collins ballads. And then there's Pink Floyd, the premier psychedelic band. With mad scientist/songwriter/acid enthusiast Syd Barret at the helm, this is a very different band than the one who would write Another Brick in the Wall and Brain Damage. <br />Barret is a very creative guitarist, utilizing dissonance and sonic tectures that you generally didn't often hear even the experimental 60's. He's a unique songwriter, but he's ummm....weird. This sounds ironic because I love tons of bizarre left of center musicians, but Mr. Barret often makes even Frank Zappa himself look like Jackson Browne is in his oddball ways. <br />I find David Gilmore's minimalism and more free-flowing style to be more to my liking, though I don't dispute Syd's contributions. Apparently, he dissappeared off the face of the earth all together. Shame, but I prefer the later Floyd works.
B00008H2LB|4.0|it gets u bored after the 500 times heard. The songs are real good though. I like Figure 09. and Numb but the rest are also awesome. I do reccomend this Cd but you msut be sure that you wont hear it 500 times on the first day.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|The Beatles 1 sounds like a great album in theory -- 27 #1 of the greatest rock band of all time. <br />The album is great for people who haven't listened to any of the songs recorded by The Beatles; this was my first album.<br />The songs on the album include the 27 songs that went to #1 on the charts.<br />The songs are great, but most of them were remastered poorly, namely &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;. You'd be better off listening to it on The Red Album (1962-1966) or Please Please Me.<br />It's disappointing to see nothing from Rubber Soul on here, but what can you do?<br />The album lists the 27 songs in the order of their release. Here is a short review of all the songs on the album:<br />1. Love Me Do - 2:19 - 5/5 : Great song, however the quality is poor. What can you expect, the song was recorded in 1962. Very catchy.<BR>2. From Me To You - 1:49 - 4/5 : Another great song by The Beatles. Recorded in 1963. Quality is semi-poor.<BR>3. She Loves You - 2:18 - 5/5 : The well known song that introduced the &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; into the Beatles. An excellent catchy song. You will find yourself singing this song to yourself on random occasions. Recorded in 1963.<BR>4. I Want To Hold Your Hand - 2:24 - 4/5 : This is an excellent song, however, one point is deducted for such a horrible remastering job. There is no excuse for making the song sound worse than the original. Recorded in 1963.<BR>5. Can't Buy Me Love - 2:15 - 5/5 : An excellent song. This song first appeared on the Hard Day's Night Album in 1964. Very good.<BR>6. A Hard Day's Night - 2:28 - 5/5 : A great song as well. Very catchy, appeared in the first featured film of the Beatles, appropriately named &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;. Recorded in 1964.<BR>7. I Feel Fine - 2:20 - 5/5 : In my opinion, one of the best songs on the album. Very catchy! Recorded in 1964.<BR>8. Eight Day's A Week - 2:43 - 5/5 : Another great song, also very catchy. First appeared on the Beatles For Sale album. Recorded in 1964.<BR>9. Ticket To Ride - 3:03 - 5/5 : One of the best songs on the &quot;Help!&quot; album in my opinion. Should be listened to right away. Recorded in 1965. <BR>10. Help! - 2:16 - 4/5 : A good song on the Help! album. Get's old quick. Recorded in 1965.<BR>11. Yesterday - 2:04 - 5/5 : An brilliant song on the &quot;Help!&quot; album. I highly recommend listening to it. Recorded in 1965. <BR>12. Day Tripper - 2:37 - 5/5 : Also, a very catchy song. Not really sure where it first appeared. Available on the Red Album. Recorded in 1965.<BR>13. We Can Work It Out - 2:10 - 5/5 : A great song. Not sure where it first appeared on. Also available on The Red Album. Recorded in 1965. <BR>14. Paperback Writer - 2:25 - 3/5 : I don't really like this song. It's odd. Not sure where it appeared on first. On the Red Album. Recorded in 1966.<BR>15. Yellow Submarine - 2:40 - 4/5 : An odd song by Ringo. First appeared on Revolver, then later on the Yellow Submarine album. Recorded in 1966. <BR>16. Eleanor Rigby - 2:11 - 5/5 - Excellent song, one of the best on Revolver. Recorded in 1966.<BR>17. Penny Lane - 3:00 - 5/5 Great song, appeared on the ground breaking Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band. Recorded in 1966-1967. <BR>18. All You Need Is Love - 3:57 - 3/5 : Never listened to it. Never sounded appealing. Recorded in 1967, on Magical Mystery Tour.<BR>19. Hello, Goodbye - 3:24 - 5/5 : A great song, very catchy. First appeared on Magical Mystery Tour, recorded in 1967. <BR>20. Lady Madonna - 2:17 - 5/5 : A very catchy song; short, but sweet. Not sure where this appeared on, but you can also find it on The Blue Album (1967-1970). Recorded in 1968.<BR>21. Hey Jude - 7:11 - 5/5 : Can be considered one of the best of the Beatles. The first three minutes are genious, while the other four is just &quot;na, na, na na na na&quot;. Great song, recorded in 1968.<BR>22. Get Back - 3:09 - 5/5: Great, catchy song. Appeared on the album &quot;Let It Be&quot;, one of their not-so-great albums. Recorded in early 1969.<BR>23. The Ballad of John and Yoko - 2:58 - 4/5 : Tells the story of the marriage of John and Yoko. Recorded in 1969, released as a single.<BR>24. Something - 2:59 - 5/5 : If I could, I'd give it a 10 out of 5. Amazing ballad that appeared on the brilliant Abbey Road. Excellent song. Recorded in 1969.<BR>25. Come Together - 4:16 - 5/5: A great song that appeared on Abbey Road. Makes no sense at all. Recorded in 1969.<BR>26. Let It Be - 3:50 - 4/5 : I don't really like this song too much. Recorded in 1969-1970. On the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album.<BR>27. The Long And Winding Road: 3:40 - 3/5 : Not a good way to end the album. A little tedious. Much better on the &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; album.<br />Well, there was my review. Hopefully, you'll enjoy this album.<br />- Scott Cohen
B000060P79|4.0|Ok so its their first album. They really couldve done better, of course there are great songs like Perfect, Grow Up, My Alien, Addicted and Im Just A Kid but the rest really could be better. I think thr guys will do great on the next time cuz theyve proved theyve got what it takes.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|I really can't add anything more than the hundreds of people who've submitted reviews before me, but for the record, this was one scary film.  It's also the film that gave us Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi.<br /><br />I remember seeing this on video back in 1985 with a group of about twenty people.  I remember hearing screams and yells of surprise from both guys and girls in the group.  I was fifteen at the time and there are images in this film that still give me the creeps.<br /><br />The thing to keep in mind while watching this is that it was made on a shoe string budget back in the early 80's.  So sure, the special effects don't hold a candle to what can be done today, but for the time, it worked.  And the make-up -- the voices and those white eyes -- always scared the bejeezus out of me.  There's still lots of shock value left in this film for many more generations.  To me, this truly is a classic Horror film that if often duplicated, but never surpassed.<br /><br />Join us...
B000089RVX|4.0|Awesome but the songs can sometimes desesperate you as some of m are too slow. Buy It
0345440900|5.0|I have reccommended this book to all my new mom friends. This book saved me and my baby from insanity. I have a &quot;Touchy&quot; baby who was not easy the first 3 months, but after following Tracy's techniques my son has been and continues to be an excellent sleeper. All advice in this book was uselful from breastfeeding to taking care of the caregiver, or MOM. This was my bible and I have heard nothing but praise about it from each person who I have been able to pass it on to. <br />Use it as a guide. I had this and many books, but this one helped me the most. Everyone is different and every baby is different. Trust in your instinct and this book will give you the knowledge to go along with that.
B00009V7RF|4.0|Its just that im not a big rap/hip-hop lover but im atracted to the choruses. Anxiety rulz and Where is the love is really true
B0000CEB4V|5.0|It is hard to add anything to what has been said.  This is one of the best concert films ever.  For any George Harrison fan, Beatles fan or music fan, this is a real treat.<br />The only complaint I had was with some of the editing during the guitar work.  The camera focus was on Clapton, but it was Andy Fairweather Low, Marc Mann or Albert Lee playing the solo.  Maybe a &quot;guitar player's cut&quot; will be available one day.<br />Hard to watch the first time with dry eyes, and each successive viewing brings out more and more of the subtle emotion and love these wonderful people had for their friend George.<br />Enjoy!
0192833588|5.0|Although it is not the first novel she ever wrote, the writing reflects much of her time. A charming read that will certainly pull at your emotions.
B000002KKS|3.0|This was my first Black Sabbath release, many moons ago, on (ack!) eight-track tape, so I decided to purchase it again on CD.<br />It's just as good as I remember, way back when, but the quality of the sound is also just as good as I remember.  (On tape)<br />I'm sorry I didn't spend the extra couple of bucks and get the re-mastered version.
B00008S2VH|4.0|This is a solid album. Madonna's releases probably often suffer from comparison to her previous efforts that turned into megahits, so let's step back and try to judge this in the here and now on its own merit. Most of the compositions are in minor key, which gives this album a sometimes wistful and sad tone. The songs \\"Hollywood,\\" \\"Love Profusion,\\" and \\"Easy Ride\\" are beautiful; and \\"American Life,\\" \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" & \\"Die Another Day\\" are very catchy and addictive. I enjoy listening to the lyrics and appreciate that she is apparently continually trying to open herself up and grow and express herself. Her voice has grown by leaps and bounds ever since \\"Evita,\\" and I love her guitar playing. I also like the electronica that has been part of her songs since \\"Ray of Light.\\" The only thing I don't like on this album: the rap sequences in \\"American Life\\" and \\"Mother and Father.\\" They just don't seem to belong and sound a bit silly. Overall this is a great CD.
B000002UTO|3.0|This album has four rather silly pop singles on it, taking up almost all of side one(I have it on tape). Too Late Marlene is a lovely song though, too bad it wasn't on side two so I could avoid side one all together. Side two on the other hand is really good, full of rich and beautifull pieces of music, emotional, thoughtfull and meaningfull. I would recommend the album for those.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Well, so much was said as to how similar Room on Fire was to Is This It that I just had to buy it. After all Is This It has become an all time favorite of mine so I said to my self \\"you can't have too much of a good thing, right?\\" Maybe I just expected too much similarity. Sure there are similarities between the two but I wouldn't say to the extent that people are saying. It's kinda hard to explain, no pun intended; Is This It just seemed so chill-out. Room just didn't quite have that chill element if you know what I mean. I don't think it is as good either. Don't misunderstand; I think it is a great cd. It's just that Is This It is so hard to beat in my opinion with so many strong songs (pretty much the whole cd). Room has some strong songs but not the whole cd. 1-3 and maybe 7 are strong while most of the others are good songs but lacking something (like coherence maybe) that is so present in what I call the strong songs. I even found one or two songs to be mediocre which is unfortunate (tracks 8 and 9). I do recommend this cd though. Like I said the first 3 or 4 songs are excellent and most of the others are good too. Where most cds today at best have 1 or 2 \\"good\\" songs on them you just can't go wrong with the Strokes, arguably the best new band out there.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|It's obvious that Clapton is having fun on this album. With only one or two exceptions (&quot;They're Red Hot&quot; and &quot;Come On in My Kitchen&quot; come to mind) these songs seem to fit Clapton like comfortable old shoes. <br />Portnoy's harmonica play is great; he fills in very nicely and subtly. The entire backup band is excellent.<br />Some of Clapton's blues songs and albums can be overproduced and overly polished. I think this album was done very well. I think it's a very good tribute to one of Clapton's idols.
0671027344|5.0|When i started the perks of being a wallflower, i was reading it on a recommendation from a friend who loved it. well, my friend was so right.  The perks of being a wallflower is not only funny but touching at the same moment.  It carefully details a boy's life in his freshman year of high school, being a pariah and not having any friends his own age.  Even though i couldn't personally identify with all of his pain and suffering, the exquisite writing on the part of the author made all of that seem real.  I'm not a very fast reader unless i really love a book, and i finished this book in less than a week.  From the moment i picked it up, i could not put it down.  Also, the letter format made it very easy to read and be able to put down and pick up again.  For impatient readers who aren't able to stand long chapters and uneventful books, look no further.  There is so much happening yet so many profound letters too.  I would recommend this for all ages of readers.  Being a freshman in high school, i loved it.  I didn't have to read it for school, just for fun, and i thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is truly one of the best, non-corny coming-of-age novels that there are.
B0001XALT6|5.0|This DVD is great.  The director's cut is not just the original movie re-packaged.  Atleast twenty scenes have been re-edited with new footage.  I loved it!  The DVD also has some great extras.  Great job Miramax!
B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead's album debut is a brilliant album that combines dark breakbeats, and Beth Gibbons haunting vocals. Beginning with the excellent &quot;Mysterons,&quot; DUMMY hits gold with &quot;Sour Times&quot;. The album has a very unique atmosphere, the relationship between the music and Gibbons' vocals which go from one emotional extreme to another, makes for an endearing listen. The production is top notch. One of the best albums from the 90s.
B000002H72|5.0|I've listened to this album on and off for several years and it still moves me. The creativity is unmatched. You won't hear this style of music anywhere else because its one of a kind. If you like your drinks strong and your music stronger, then try this. You won't be disappointed.
B000003TSP|5.0|After an album like DUMMY, it appears it would be difficult to follow up such a great album. It took the group three years to come up with this second album, and it was worth the wait. Released in the fall of 1997, this album still gets quite a bit of airplay in my CD player. As a whole I think this album is a lot more darker than DUMMY. The music is mystical and dark, with Beth Gibbons emoted vocals, very layered. What's even more impressive about this album is the songwriting, which is stronger than on DUMMY. This isn't an album that sinks in right away, but with repeated listenings more is revealed in the intricate production. There are so many layers. Overall, it gets better with each listen, and overall a very unique and rewarding musical experience.
B000000WA4|5.0|I am a huge Pumpkins fan and out of all of their 6 studio releases, Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness is their best album. Amazingly, this album was recorded in 5 months and the sound doesn't show it. This album has amazing sound and this is one of the Pumpkins best accomplishments. Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness has some of the bands most meaningful and from-the-heart-songs. This double-album contains: <BR>Dawn to Dusk(disc #1) <BR>1. Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness(instrumental) <br />2. Tonight, Tonight <BR>3. Jellybelly <BR>4. Zero <BR>5. Here is No Why <BR>6. Bullet With Butterfly Wings(despite all my rage) <BR>7. To Forgive <BR>8. F**k You(an ode to no one) <BR>9. Love <BR>10. Cupid de Locke <BR>11. Galapogos <BR>12. Muzzle <BR>13. Porecelina Of The Vast Oceans <BR>14. Take me down <BR>Twilight to Starlight(disc #2) <BR>1. Where Boys Fear To Tread <BR>2. Bodies <BR>3. Thirty-Three <BR>4. In The Arms of Sleep <BR>5. 1979 <BR>6. Tales of A Scorched Earth <BR>7. Thru The Eyes of Ruby <br />8. Stumbleine <BR>9. X.Y.U. <br />10. We Only Come Out At Night <BR>11. Beautiful <BR>12. Lily(my one and only) <BR>13. By Starlight <BR>14. Farewell and Goodnight <br />  This is an album you can listen to over and over again and everytime you listen to it, it means something new to you. The front cover art and the art in the booklets is wonderful. If you're a Pumpkin fan, and you don't own this, you should buy it. I also reccomend this to anyone who wants to get into the Smashing Pumpkins. I garuntee you'll enjoy it.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown tells an incredible story that cleverly intertwines fact and fiction in a novel that keeps you spellbound.
0385504209|2.0|I'm not normally into paperback thrillers, but thought I'd give this particular book a go since I'm a bit of a (make that \\"lot of a\\") conspiracy/Fortean/Knights-Templars-are-the-Masons nut.<br />As an introduction to said conspiracy theories surrounding Da Vinci, Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and the Templars, it's a quick read, though the author takes liberties with the original theories themselves (although if you don't believe any of the theories in the first place, this is hardly criticism).<br />As a thriller, it's just dull. The lead characters spend their time running/driving from one place to another, with their enemies in hot pursuit (think Penelope Pitstop and the Hooded Claw). The characters are immemorable, and just mouthpieces for expositionary lumps of the above theories. The enemies come across as comical rather than forbidding, which they should be; it seems strange that a conspiracy that has some of the leading scientists and thinkers in world history at its heart only has a bunch of losers to oppose it (actually, there's not even enough of them to quantify as a \\"bunch\\").<br />(...)
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The Matrix Revolutions, much like The Matrix Reloaded, is a victim of the hype machine that powered it.  These sequels were built up until, coupled with the legacy of the original, there was no way these movies could meet everyone's expectations.<br />Despite what the naysayers will tell you, The Matrix Revolutions is an excellent movie; lightyears beyond most other films in its genre.<br />The plot is much more intelligent and interesting than your standard sci-fi / action flick.  There are several layers to the conflict that the predecessors of this movie have built up.  The action is first-rate; whether it is a gun-fight on a ceiling, a massive assault on an underground city, or the climactic battle between Smith and Neo in the rain, Revolutions attempts to one-up its sequels in any way possible.<br />Many complain that not enough was wrapped up or that not enough questions were answered.  To quote the original Matrix, the answers are there, but the movie can only show you the door - you're the one that has to walk through it.  The Matrix trilogy has never been about giving answers - it is about posing questions and making you answer them for yourself.  You know, actually THINKING a little - a quality that is most unlike the vast majority of action movies.  Obviously, not everyone will like this - some people want to sit back and zone out when watching a movie.<br />The Matrix movies have received far more flak than they deserve; ripping on the sequels has become, for many, a 'cool' thing to do.  I would contend that, when given a chance with an open mind, these movies stand as one of the best trilogies of all time along with Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.
0385504209|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it in a weekend. It was like an Indiana Jones movie in that it's this wild adventure on a quest for sacred things. Don't get tripped up by the history. A lot of negative reviews are saying the author got it wrong. Well, this is a work of fiction, based on some historical facts and events. It says quite clearly at the beginning of the book what is fact -- the religious groups and the architecture. Don't get wrapped up in fact vs. fiction, just enjoy a fun, interesting story that might actually make you go, &quot;hm...?&quot; at the end.
6302759110|5.0|Gary Oldman turned in yet another outstanding performance as Dracula.  Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, Anthony Hopkins, and the rest of the cast were perfect in their respective roles to make this one of the best Dracula films ever.<br />Unfortunately, the movie does not stick to Bram Stoker's novel.  As I read the novel, I expected it to be somewhere along the lines of Francis Ford Coppola's movie and nothing could be further from the truth.  In Stoker's novel, Dracula was not a Christian warrior, nor was there an Elisabeta.  Most of all, Mina had absolutely no attraction to the Count whatsoever.  In fact she took the lead in destroying Dracula.<br />BUT despite this I do love this movie for the visual effects and the way the story unfolds - it sweeps you off your feet and makes you want to watch it many times.

0385504209|1.0|Fun reading, addictive fiction (though the prose and style leave much to be desired), if it were not for Brown's claim that all facts, rituals, etc are &quot;accurate&quot;. Oh my! Umberto Eco has done way better in entertaining the reader while being historically accurate at the same time. Brown smuggles crackpot history for facts, along the worse Hollywood style. So be it... I do not recommed this book to anyone interested in learning rather than being entertained.
B00006CXSS|4.0|This is one of the best series about WWII that I have seen.  Just the story, the visuals, the acting, excellent!  I watched in one sitting practically, it was that riveting.<br />It's too bad that these American &quot;patriots&quot;, who without European help would not even have a country to be a &quot;patriot&quot; of have to go and spoil everything.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is simply brilliant.  A must-have for any serious minded musician.<br />It's clear, here, what genuine talent, hard work and love of your craft can produce.  It's also wonderful seeing the band grow over their 11 years at the top.<br />Mezmerizing and utterly magical.  Buy it, I urge you!
B0000C9JFO|3.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and although I enjoyed pretty much the whole thing, my favorite parts were the ones with the english brother (played by Kevin Bishop).  That's what made me want to to buy this movie (as opposed to just renting it).  I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that the DVD version cut out some of these funny parts.  There were 3 scenes that were really funny - all of them were shortened on the DVD version (did Steven Spielberg edit this?)<br />If you could care less about the parts with Wendy's brother (Kevin Bishop), by all means get this movie.  If you like these parts, then I would NOT Recommend buying this DVD(rent it instead).
B00006RINF|4.0|I recently bought the newest effort of Lacuna Coil, and Comalies is an amazing records. In fact they are my top three favorite bands at the moment.However, I am a bigger fan of Evanescence, which I bought first. There is no need to bash Ev. So big deal they are not as metal as LC? Evanescence is still a popular and talented rock band, and Amy Lee has an amazing voice as well. I think one can find some similarities between both bands. I think people can like both bands and appreciate all their music.
B000002H33|5.0|This album will kill all of the damn posers out there, because it is too heavy for them, well so what. overall, this Metallica's best and heaviest album along with Ride The Lightning. So if you dont have it, go get it, or youre a poser.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Thank God Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are all dead or Lucas would have them rewriting the gospels with ridiculous special effects.  Why can't I have the Star Wars I grew up with?  And why couldn't Lucas at least do what Spielberg did with ET and include BOTH versions in the box? Oh wait, that's next Christmas' multimillion dollar release for George so he can make still more money on the only successful thing he ever created. (Except maybe American Graffiti). I will wait until the Classic Star Wars is released on DVD - meanwhile I am keeping my tapes and my VCR. I wouldn't touch this version with a 10 foot light saber.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|This is a great movie. But, nevertheless compared to Reloaded, this movie is a little tame when it comes to the action sequences. But, then again, it's the continuing storyline that we're insterested in here. The Wachowski Brothers has done it again with their groundbreaking effect. And this time, they've up the ante with the Super Burly Brawl sequence, very impressive. Although the storyline is there, it wasn't arranged in order. In fact, it was thrown all over the movie in bits and pieces, left there for the poor audience to wreck his/her brains out. So is the plot. By all means, this movie is great when partnered and watched with the first two Matrix movies, but when taken apart, this movie doesn't look great as a standalone sci-fi action movie. That's where it falls short. Another part is when Neo decided, at the last minute, to sacrifice his life to Smith, for the sake of Zion, the grand finale seems to lack the \\"boom\\" effect. If you're a true Matrix fan, like me, you should put the flaws aside and you'll enjoy the ride. Also, on a lighter note, the two latter movies should've done better without the so-called \\"bedroom scenes\\" or the sexuality parts, which was really unnecessary. We know, Neo and Trinity are meant to be together, but they don't have to put it so \\"elaborately\\". There's where the movie becomes \\"diluted\\" to a certain point. If you ask me, I'd say that I still love the first movie, The Matrix, a no-nonsense sci-fi action movie and in my humble opinion, the first is always the best no matter which way you watch it. That's why I only gave 4 stars. But, on a whole, The Matrix Revolutions is somewhat a great movie. Just my two cents worth!
B000092ZYX|1.0|Just like every other group out there trying to make money off of the heated political issues of today, Radiohead attempts to capitalize off an evergrowing trend.  Radiohead needs to find a new niche because this one has been taken by groups that can do it way better like NOFX
B00006LLOG|5.0|This is a great recording by a very interesting artist...  definitely one of the best lyric writers in rock and roll.  I've listened to all of his official solo albums as well as every official Velvet Underground album.  This is probably the best one to start out with if you are just getting into Lou Reed.  Lou Reed is not often easy to take, but I would say that Transformer is his most accessible solo recording.  If you liked Walk on the Wild Side, you will most likely enjoy the rest of this disc.  All of the tunes fit together nicely.  Bowie's production, although a bit muddy, definitely makes Reed more palatable.  Bowie's background vocals are fabulous.  I've never been crazy about Mick Ronson's guitar playing (it's technically good and immediately recognizable, but seems too dated), however the keyboards, horns and bass are extraordinarily timeless.  I first heard this recording almost twenty years ago, and I still find some of the lyrics just stunning!  My favorites are Andy's Chest and Satellite of Love.  If you are just starting out listening to Lou Reed with this disc, I would recommend Coney Island Baby, then New Sensations or possibly New York next.  All the Velvet Underground albums are masterpieces.  Enjoy.
0571081789|5.0|Read it through in less than a few days and could not, would not put it down.  The Bell Jar allowed me to see into the depth of the character's feelings and mind.  Well written and wonderfully deep.  Her gift of talent to the reader haunts.
0783225792|5.0|Martin Scorcese, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, you can't go wrong.  This is one of my all time favorite movies for 3 simple reasons. 1) Robert DeNiro is my favorite actor 2)Martin Scorsese is my favorite Director 3) and I LOVE gangster movies.  Everybody who has seen this movie knows how good it is so I dont have to say much.  But if you havent seen this movie you need to buy it.  I say buy it and not rent it simply because your guaranteed to love it.  I even got my girlfriend to watch it. (only because she made me watch Dirty Dancing) and she thought it was a good movie.  So just give it a chance and it wont disappoint.
B000002UDB|5.0|I only listen to a few songs on every album cause i'm really picky when it comes to music. This album along with sgt. pepper's are the beatle's best albums, each having 4 songs i really like. this album's songs: Penny Lane, Hello goodbye, All you need is love, and I am the Walrus.
B0000CAQ26|1.0|I suppose it's best to be up-front here: I've never particularly paid much attention to Pink before, or her music. Sure, she's got a great voice (although it's grown to irritate me now), and her debut was kinda fun. (And man, I loved Most Girls and Hell Wit Ya) And while I didn't find M!ssundaztood to be the masterpiece everyone else regarded it as, I thought it was pretty nice all the same.<br />But then... well, something happened. In-between all this, Pink's attitude turned cocky, and she seemed to be trying to convince everyone (including, it seems, herself) that she was some sort of bad, cool rebel chick who didn't give a crap about the who, what, when, where, how, and why of any or everything.<br />Unfortunately, the rebel-chick-in-training rears her head all over and album that should've been good.<br />The music's decent for the most part - if you're into energetic pop-rock (like I am), then if you ignore the lyrics (in which Pink tries to shove her new attitude into our faces), then you'll be in paradise. Possibly.<br />Unfortunately for me, the songs on Try This either drag on far too long (Trouble, Catch Me While I'm Sleeping), or are too loud and screechy, and the lyrics are often too eye-rolling (Humble Neighborhoods, in which Pink declares \\"We're bad people and we do bad things\\") or hypocritical (the amusing Try Too Hard - in which Pink chastises someone for trying too hard to be percieved as different and special - never mind that Pink seems to have befallen the same unfortunate fate - and the crass, just-plain-dumb hidden track, Hooker, which finds Pink calling someone... well, a hooker, although I'm pretty sure Pink won't be the demurity poster child anytime soon)<br />There IS one bright spot through all the muck and suck, however, and - surprise surprise - it's a dance track (God Is A DJ) which is just plain fun if you ignore the, once again, \\"I'm-a-bad-chick\\" attempts on here (\\"cigarette smile,\\" \\"daddy, I hate you,\\" \\"lover, hey, [Fornication Under Consent of King] you\\")<br />I tried to like it. But, in the end, it just failed to grab me. Plus, Pink's attitude does nothing to help my opinion of the album itself, so there's another strike against her. Hopefully, though, soon she'll just stop trying so hard to come across as cool and bad and just be herself. (And let THAT speak for her - subtly, though, not bash it into our heads with the lyrics like on here)<br />(Although I'm glad to see others are enjoying it, at least)
B000002UAU|5.0|this and magical mystery tour are the beatles' best albums. songs i really like on this album: getting better, with a little help from my friends, lucy in the sky with diamonds, when i'm 64
0385510438|3.0|I was disappointed in this latest book.  I was exited to hear it was taking place in Canton &amp; the story sounded great but somewhere along the line the book just didn't prove to be what it could have been.  Where is the John Grisham of &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; or The Painted House?&quot;  It was still a good read just because John Grisham wrote it.
B00005JMSE|4.0|I watched this movie only a few days ago, and I've got to say, it was definitely one of the better comic-to-movie adaptations.<br />However, while it 'was' good, and fun, it definitely left me with the feeling that it could have been better.  Unfortunately, I'm not certain just 'how' it could have been improved.<br />Anyway, this is definitely a good fun-filled movie to see.
B000000H66|5.0|Amazing death metal record. My favourite Death album!<BR>What more can I say? Buy it if you appreciate fabulously played music with thought-provoking lyrics.
B000068FUS|5.0|I'll stand behind the title above. DBT are proud of their Southern heritage but at the same time very realistic about the shortcomings of Southern life. Hence their songs have in the past been about everything from incest to glue sniffing. Intelligent lyrics and keen insight are crucial aspects of DBTs songs.<br />In Southern Rock Opera they push the envelope in an odd way. They record a two cd song-cycle that is basically about life in the seventies and the end of Lynyrd Skynyrd. It could have been a disaster or a pigeon-holed curiousity. Instead it may be one of the best rock albums of the last twenty years.<br />There are great songs here such as &quot;Ronnie and Neil&quot; and &quot;Dead Drunk and Naked&quot;. Truth be told there really aren't any throwaways in the bunch. But the real stand outs in my mind are the near spoken word &quot;Days of Graduation&quot; and &quot;The Three Great Alabama Icons&quot;. I don't think anyone who went to high school in any small town or lived in the seventies and knew who Wallace was can listen to this and not feel the impact.<br />Highly recommended.
B00006879E|1.0|I have listened to one or two of the songs after hearing about how great this band is and everything else about them. In truth, I do not believe I have ever heard worse music, probably in my entire life. The beat, lyrics, the rhythm, the lead singer's voice... If you were driving in a car and heard this song on the radio, you would be best advised to turn to a different station. If you can't do that, turn to your left and drive straight off the bridge. I can honestly say I would rather be deaf than listen to this music. It is this bad. DO NOT BUY THIS CD! IF YOU ACCIDENTLY RECIEVE A COPY, DISPOSE OF IT IMMEDIATELY!
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|While I've had Orphaned Land's first album, Sahara (and quite liked it), I didn't really know what to expect when I got this album. But, since I bought it at a friends recomendation, I thought it also would be quite good. Man, was I wrong! IT'S AMAZING! There is nothing, and I mean nothing, wrong with this album. So diverse and powerful. Absolutely breath-taking. <BR>It begins with &quot;Birth of the Three&quot;, and right at the get-go you can tell how great this album is. Very good song, that changes alot throughout it. Begins with almost narrative singing and headbanging riffs, but then goes on into beautiful singing by Kobi. He also showcases his great death-growl, which can't be more fitting to the verses he sings. There is also a part that the singing goes into an arabic yodeling thingy, and I just can't help myself but sing along. Great song<BR>The second song is &quot;Ocean Land&quot;, and this a definite favorite among fans, myself included. After a cool little intro, the song begins with heavy riffs and singing, but again changes into beautiful singing. I particularly  like the vocal line near the end of &quot;Here are we, servants three, flesh and blood&quot;. Also very worthy of a sing-along. Also, Matti the guitarist, shows his skills with a very cool solo.<BR>The next song is &quot;The Kiss Of Babylon&quot;, and this begins with one of the heaviest parts of the album, and then, as usual, goes into beautiful singing, and so more yodeling that goes with the excellant riffs, and this time its even better than the first time! It ends with only female vocals,singing in Yemen, and while I usually can't stand this stuff, on this album it just adds to the atmosphere. <BR>The next track &quot;A'salk&quot; continues the solo singing and also has some very nice classic guitar stuff in the background. While I like this part and find it a nice break, many will probably skip this track.<BR>Next comes one of the highlights of the album, &quot;Halo Dies&quot;, and this is probably the heaviest song on the album, though probably not at first. It begins with a Hebrew sentence spoken by Kobi, and then the melodic guitars, and shortly after come the melodic singing. By the middle, it all changes and the aggresiveness comes in. This part is very death-metally and very cool and worthy of headbanging and moshing. Also used in this heavy part, is some sort of unusual sound affect that I don't know whats its called, but is used very well to seperate the verses (I can't explain it better than that - when you hear it you'll understand). After all this heaviness, enters very beautiful work by the band music wise, and they create a wonderfu melodic feeling by the end of this song. This song is a perfect example of how Orphaned Land managed to mix harshness and aggressiveness with lovely melodies that make you want to cry. Just magic!<BR>Next song &quot;A Call To Awake&quot; continues the story with a great main riff throughout. Near the end of it, there are some very cool vocal plays throughout the last verses (again, if you hear, you'll understand). This track end with a very Dream Theater-esque feel, and fans of this band will feel right at home.<BR>&quot;Building the Ark&quot; is a laid back track, that for the most part is in Latin, except the last verse. Nice break.<BR>&quot;Nora El Nora&quot; is originally some kind of Hebrew folk song, I think, and this track is a very good adaptation to it. Never thought I would headbang and sing along to something like this.<BR>&quot;The Calm Before The Flood&quot; is just what the title says... a calming instrumental. Sort of gives us a breather before the finale.<BR>The last two tracks &quot;Mabool/The Storm Still Rages Inside&quot; go hand in hand and are definately the highlight of the album, in my opinion. Mabool has the best singing (and lyrics) of the album, and some of the best music of it too. The Storm Still... is a just the most beatiful song I've heard in a long time. Wow. I just love this song so much. Yosi really displays his talents on this one with amazing solo's. I can't think of such and end to an album as good as this (even though techincally this isn't the last track), aside from Iced Earth's &quot;Question Of Heaven&quot;. Absolutely breathtaking.<BR>The last track &quot;Rainbow&quot;, is another instrumental, on a classic guitar. Very nice and ends the album with a smile.<br />Now, on to the concept. Very original idea. It tells of the three sons of seven - while seven represents God and each son one of the religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism). They have a task to warn the world of the flood that will come if they don't change their ways. Sort of a modern day Noah. Once you know the idea, it's very easy to follow along the concept with the lyrics. Speaking of which, this album uses 5 languages: English, Hebrew, Yemen, Latin and Gibberish (a language that the band made up). If you are not fluent in these languages, don't worry. Each has a translation into English in the booklet.<BR>All in all, the best album I've heard in a long time, and will probably stay that way.<br />The second disc on the limited edition is almost half an hour of an unplugged show, where the band showcase their older songs. Again, very good and this album alone is worth it, let alone the other Masterpiece. The album has beautiful re-enditions of their songs, highlight being &quot;The Beloved's Cry, when the audience sings. <br />A MUST ALBUM FOR  EVERYONE!!!
B00011RPB0|5.0|After I saw this movie, I sat in my bed and thought about it for an hour and then came online to read anything I could about it.  I've never seen a movie that touched me on such a personal level and I've never even been to Tokyo.  Lost in Translation is like a subtle perfume, it's not a story as much a feeling that makes you tingle every time you watch (or smell) it.  Whenever I feel down about anything, I watch it and it lifts my spirits.  There's no other movie like this- it changed the way I look at life and film. Best movie if the whole wide world.
B000089RVR|5.0|I have to say this one is better than her first, and I love that one.  This is one of the rare CDs that I can listen to just about all of the tracks and sing along.  Each song is a bit different, but catchy.  It's great!  I highly recommend this one.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|One of the better Beatles greatest hits records because there are only four songs from Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour combined.  Most of the rest are from their Beatlemania period which was their strongest period.
B00005RY7X|4.0|If it's not obvious, &quot;Andrew W.K.'s&quot; plan here is to party, and man does he. This is pretty much a 35 minute beer commercial. Every song is basically loud, fun, and mostly yelling. But as simple as it sounds, there's actually some great songs here. The 3 &quot;Party&quot; songs are highlights, and my favorite by far is &quot;She Is Beautiful&quot;. It's almost impossible not to get out the air-guitar for that one. Though this resembles some punk and hair metal, it's really it's own thing. It all rock's just as much as the album cover does.
B00018D44U|1.0|When i heard she got 8 grammies, I got her first CD that very day and played it. I had hardly been through half of it before I fell asleep and slept like I've never slept before. Her lyrics are very boring. Her voice is the worst (it is melodious but it doesn't catch your attention. I'd rather listen to Britney) Why on earth did this female get 8 grammies? In my opinion she deserves half a grammy. Just the base of it probably. <BR>I borrowed my friend's 'Feels like home' just to see whether she's improved. I saw no difference at all and I hope she doesn't get a grammy this time. <BR>What's more, when I borrowed my friend's copy, she took my copy of 'In the zone' by Britney Spears. And now she wants to exchange them. HEAVEN FORBID!!!
156224003X|5.0|Since chapter one, I got a surprise. I read the first chapter and went out to think about what I had just read. I realized my life was pretty much like Werner's. And just as his life had changed, my life should change too. I always had the urge to take courses on music and read more and more books on technique and some other technical aspects of music. And what I'd always get were 'new toys' for playing, but as I didn't learn how to play with them, I'd be frustrated. Reading Effortless Mastery helped me gain the courage to look within myself and I happened to undertand why I'd felt like that all this time. This is an amazing book for musicians! I couldn't play one more note on my keyboard until I really discovered the secret for mastery. And now I know what it is. If you want to get the idea, READ ON!
B000068QY7|5.0|After creating the masterpiece that was \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory,\\" Oasis seemed forever doomed to release albums that only, at best, hinted at their greatness. For casual fans this was annoying; for die-hards it must have been crushing. But Oasis finally broke the spell and released an album that isn't as great as \\"Glory\\" but comes close enough. Initially a lot of attention was given to the song \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\". The song functions as a nice little song to slow-dance to at your high school prom, but is actually one of the weaker tracks on the album (which is still impressive). \\"Songbird\\"--a Liam-penned track--is far more impressive in its beautiful simplicity. Another stand-out track is \\"The Hindu Times\\" which uses an Eastern guitar riff throughout (Eastern influences appear all over the album). That song is a lot of fun to drive to, and it should've had an awesome video to accompany it (the real one is lame). The album still has its flaws--it's too hit-heavy in the front, there's no real sense of all the songs making up a bigger whole, etc--but it's still easily their best post-\\"Glory\\" album yet. If you like Oasis even remotely you should definitely get this album.
B000063WDH|5.0|hi all i want to say i like the black keys the 1st time i heard them was on punk-0-rama 8 which is a good cd also so anyways the black keys were on that cd and ever since then ive been wanting to hear more and more of there music its a mix of classical rock thing and blues and kinda the whole hendix thing the black keys were inspierd by led zephlin sooo thats all i have to say oh yeah i like white stripes there a good band too
B000002UW1|4.0|This was my first &quot;R.E.M.&quot; album, which makes sense since it was the first of theirs to reach the ears of the masses. &quot;Out Of Time&quot; was actually when they really became huge, but this one got the name out. The big songs here are &quot;The One I Love&quot; and &quot;It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot;, but &quot;Finest Worksong&quot; was a minor hit too. However I enjoy &quot;Exhuming McCarthy&quot;, &quot;Fireplace&quot;, and others just as much. Their next album &quot;Green&quot; is also very good, and if you want a sampling of their early years, including this album, check out &quot;Eponymous&quot;.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Ok, maybe all the songs aren't very great but all of them are pretty enjoayable and some tracks are very enjoyable. <BR>Britney's voice, however, is the major drawback of the songs. But she does sound kind of sexy instead of being melodious which is a different approach to music. It isn't bad and is in fact very mature and listenable. And I'd say the lyrics aren't very extraordinary being a songwriter myself. But they're good enough and the tunes and beats add to the making of some quality pop/rnb style music. <BR>Apart from dance numbers, there are also a couple of decent ballads one of them being an extraordinary ballad (Everytime). To a hardcore pop music fan, there might not be any fillers in the CD. Not being one myself, I found 2 or 3 songs not very likeable. But then again there is hardly any CD where I like all the songs. This is more mature than her previous CDs and highly not recommended for below music fans aged below 13.
0684857820|5.0|The author deals with the story of her own rape in an honest forthright manner.  The reader will feel as though he is alongside Ms. Sebold as she recounts events of her childhood and young adulthood.  I found myself cringing for her as she related the reactions of friends and family to the news of her rape.  It was disconcerting to see how being the victim of rape led to circumstances in which the victim continues to be victimized.  My daughter just started college and I gave her the book to read. While I don't want her to live her whole life looking over her shoulder, I think this book provides a graphic, long-term look at how events can unfold in an innocent person's life.
B000002C25|2.0|Oasis achieved phenomenal success with the release of their 1995 album &quot;(What's the Story) Morning Glory,&quot; but then followed the unfortunate trend of having their next album suffer. Still, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; has its moments. The best song on here is obviously &quot;All Around the World&quot;. It's long, pretentious, and has a stunning music video to go along with it; it's reminiscent of the Guns N' Roses' song &quot;November Rain&quot;. The album also houses &quot;The Girl in the Dirty Shirt,&quot; which is the nasaliest of any song Liam's sung before or since. The rest of the album is mostly just OK, making this a major disappointment given the brilliance of their last album. Oasis completists will want this album; everybody else would be wise to just buy &quot;All Around the World&quot; as a single and leave it at that.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I liked that GL restored and cleaned up the classic trilogy. What I HATED was the added Jabba... COME ON!!!! that looked incredibly FAKE and horrible, I liked that overlarge, slimy, fat and evil Jabba of ROTJ... that CGI Jabba was an INSULT to the original crimelord. What was wrong about Han frying Greedo?? The  alien was giving two choices to Han: to turn him to Jabba to collect the reward  or give him money to forget he saw him. (...)<br /> It´s annoying that George doesn´t want to please his fans with the one thing we´ve been asking for YEARS... having BOTH versions in the DVD. I mean Steve Spielberg did that with E.T. <br /> I´m buying it  because I want to have those movies on DVD, but I buy them under protest .
B00006V9A0|4.0|Some people might say it was when \\"Soundgarden\\" broke up, but I think the end of grunge happened 10 years ago today, the day \\"Kurt Cobain\\" died. I know not everone worships these guys, but nobody can deny the greatness of this band, and the influence they had on a generation. They were the \\"Sex Pistols\\" of the 90's, and exposed a new way of rocking to the masses. This collection isn't perfect, but what's here is all excellent music. Obviously it includes \\"About A Girl\\", \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", and the infamous \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", but it also has the previously unreleased track \\"You Know You're Right\\". If you're a newcomer to the band, or don't have their 3 original albums, this is a good place to start. Thanks \\"Kurt\\".
B000007489|5.0|The benchmark for a quality crossover album the suicidal boys did it right on this one.  Rocky George and Mike Clark aren't even on this album, back then it was Grant Estes handling guitar duties and with Louie Mayorga on Bass and Amery Smith on drums, a great band. <BR>This is teenage ainxte and suicidal tendencies put into the form of hardcore punk/metal crossover with Mike Muir screaming his feelings over the blistering paced riffs.  Great lyrics, great tunes, a bit short, but what punk rock wasn't back then?  28 minutes or so of this is still 10 times better than 5 hours of Nupunk or Numetal.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence is a remarkable story of brutal racism and the courage of three children.  Until as recently as 1970, Australia's harsh policy toward its aboriginal people allowed for the forcible capture of half-white children and their relocation in concentration-camp-like centers, for the purpose of training them to be domestic servants in white society.  This film tells the true story of three such girls who escaped from the center in 1932, and walked 1500 miles back to their family.  Their only marker, across the desolate desert and bush, was the world's longest fence, the \\"rabbit-proof fence,\\" which eventually led them home.<br /><br />This story of Australia's misguided attempt to help the aborigines \\"in spite of themselves\\" has an excellent script and direction.  The children, all non-actors, are wonderfully convincing and sympathetic.  Kenneth Branagh has a small role as the government official who tries to recapture the girls.  He is a by-the-books, no-nonsense man who believes he is really helping the people whose lives he decimates.  David Gulpilil plays the aboriginal tracker who relentlessly follows the girls, and his villainous character was truly frightening.  The sweeping photography of the arid outback shows just how tremendous the girls' accomplishment was.  Rabbit-Proof Fence is a very sad but important story and I heartily recommend it.
