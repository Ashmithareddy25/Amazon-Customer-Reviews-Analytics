B000FCKPHG|3.0|Sorry, but Dweck's concept of mindsets is poorly displayed in this volume.  The evidence is constantly reiterated.  We got it the first time, and the second and third. It is also subjective and superficial.  The first chapter which explicates the theory is probably worth the purchase, though barely. I had hoped for more.
034580404X|5.0|This is a great series. However I would of liked to have read a little more detail!  Over all an awesome series, I hope they continue the series!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I enjoyed Hunger Games as it had great action and great story line. The drama of protecting a younger sister was played out. The violance was a bit much. The forces between the government sponcering this and the citizens be forced into service to fulfill a watching crowd reminded me of the gladiators in roman days of the past.
0553801473|5.0|book arived in good amount of time, and in good condition, is a little smaller though then like the verison at target and maybe other retailers not sure why but to me i dont mind that. great job by shippment. and for the book if you are on book five then obviously you already know how amazing this series is its a must. and i dont understand why people dont like the fourth and five book to me just as amazing as the first one, think only reason why doesnt get alot of respect is because the 3rd book in series is my favorite book ever so people probably expected that much excitement in next too but i still love the series and hope book 6 is out soon
B007712XAU|5.0|This is an excellent and intelligent series about life in England after the sinking of the Titanic.  The acting is great, the scenery and costumes are stunning, and the story lines are engaging.  We are hooked at our house, so much  so that when there are slim pickins on network TV, we usually watch DA again.<br /><br />We sent this set of the first two seasons to friends who live in British Columbia, as a thank you for staying with them on vacation this summer.  They raved about it, as well.
0385742886|4.0|SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't read the three books in James Dashner's Maze Runner series, please do so before you read this review, which may very well give away plot points.<br /><br />The story of Mark's struggle to survive begins 13 years before Thomas wakes up in a big box. Sun flares have nearly destroyed the Earth. The tale begins with Mark waking and shivering in the early dawn of his encampment in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina. He does not yet know that this is a day that will change everything. He simply muses on the fact that being chilled is a sensation he hasn't felt in a very long time. His gruff ex-soldier friend Alec snores on the other cot in their shared hut. Mark was once intimidated by Alec, but has fought to survive alongside the older man for more than a year. In that time, they've formed a comfortable bond, which Mark demonstrates by tossing a shoe at him. Alec treats Mark with the usual tolerant good humor, which begins Mark's day in a pleasant manner. He's determined to add to his great mood by finding Trina, the love of his life.<br /><br />Mark discovers Trina reading one of those old-fashioned paper books up by the stream. On his way to find her, he had passed some of the other survivors in their group. All of them, including himself, appear starved and filthy. Yet they are fortunate. They support each other, hunting for game and scavenging food in the ruins. Mark notices that all around him the forest shows promising signs of recovery. New trees are sprouting. Burnt old ones are starting to show green once again. They have survived the most horrific natural disaster ever --- but maybe life for the forest and for humans is once again on the upswing.<br /><br />However, Mark soon discovers that their struggle to survive has only just begun when a Berg, a flying machine, rumbles through the sky above their heads. People on board the Berg begin shooting everyone with virus-laden darts; the afflicted will be terribly contagious with a disease that causes many sufferers to go insane. The first disaster was one nature wrought; this one appears to be brought on the Earth by humans. But why?<br /><br />In a series of flashbacks, we discover that Mark was with Trina when the original disaster occurred. They are riding the subtrans that bullets through underground tunnels below New York City when the subway train loses power. After they leave the train, finding their way via emergency lights in the darkness, they climb to the station platform where they discover a nightmare of naked, burned bodies. They find themselves in a desperate life-or-death situation, cornered by dangerous men, before they meet Alec, who informs them of the sun flare situation and immediately establishes himself as their leader.<br /><br />Now, after the mysterious shooters with their virus-laden darts have felled much of their survivor encampment, Mark and the others must discover how to stop this latest danger. Their journey will be treacherous and sometimes heart-breaking. It will often seem impossible for an ordinary teen like Mark to meet these challenges, but he has no choice.<br /><br />Avid adventure and post-apocalyptic thriller fans will devour THE KILL ORDER with pleasure, enjoying the nearly constant adrenaline rush of Mark conquering one challenge after another at a breathless pace. Many readers of theMaze Runner trilogy will also embrace this book, which describes in further detail the happenings in the world before Thomas awakens in his mysterious box in THE MAZE RUNNER. Some may be a bit disappointed not to learn more about Thomas' life and may be puzzled by dots that are not quite connected (but appear to be hinted at) between this story and the series books, which may make them wonder if a sequel to this prequel (if that makes any sense) is in the works. Fingers crossed!<br /><br />Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
B002Z58GQS|4.0|Works great cant wait to back up some music. I love the fact that the USB is retractable it makes it harder to lost the USB.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|After reading GGS, everything about ancient history makes sense and most of the pieces fall into place. The main point is well made: races have no place in the unequal development of societies. I only wish to have found more about what happened in Africa before the migrations to EuroAsia took place and what prompted them. Is there anyway we shall ever know? Also, I wish the role of religions in ancient societies, in particular how some religions fulfilled a necessary role to put some kind of order and introduce \\"moral values\\". How were religions born? But then, this would certainly deserve another book in itself.<br />I actually started with a borrowed printed copy, but found out my handling through the days was damaging the book and I might not be able to finish it before having to return it. So the kindle copy was perfect. Can't go without my kindle! :)
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This is a good to a very good movie. This is a movie that I would definitely recommend to friends.
0307010856|5.0|I read this book as a kid and now reading the book with my children is so much fun.  A true classic book that interacts with it's reader.
B006H5120E|4.0|I am a Titanic fanatic, I'll admit.  I used to run a fansite (one of the longest running ones in fact) and I still help a friend run one of the only remaining fan sites Back to Titanic.  I have props.  I had a couple of the dresses made as costumes.  I may have gone a bit overboard but I loved this movie and I still do.  One of the highlights for me as a fan was seeing the movie in 3D on Valentine's Day at the screening.  So needless to say, I was so excited for this Blu Ray.  However, I was disappointed in some regards.<br /><br />The Movie:<br /><br />The movie itself looks amazing.  I am glad I own it just for this.  It has been completely remastered and looks fantastic in 2D, I don't have a 3D tv but am eagerly anticipating watching this at a friends house in 3D to compare the difference.  The quality is beyond amazing and I can't imagine anyone finding it lacking.  It actually almost looks better than it did in the theater.<br /><br />The Extras:<br /><br />This is where it all falls apart!!  In 2005 the Collectors Edition came out and it was awesome.  There was so many extras and goodies!  Commentaries, Behind the Scenes and more.  Much of this is included in the Blu Ray and the sad part is that not much more IS.  There are two new documentaries and that's IT for \\"new\\" goodies that I could find.  The Titanic Facebook page was touting a Kate Winslet screen test that was supposed to be on the disc but I couldn't find it for love or money.  When seeing that, I hoped that perhaps the Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio screen test was also included on the disc but no such luck.  The two \\"new\\" documentaries are good - but if you're a Titanic fan only one is truly new as \\"Titanic: The Final Word\\" was aired this past April on television.  If you missed it, it's a great thing to see but it's not technically new.  The documentary on the film is worth a watch and does have new snippets here and there of behind the scene footage I'd not seen before and some new interviews that were interesting to see.  I liked seeing the coverage from the very beginnings of the movie all the way through the premiere of the 3D release.  However I just feel that things fall flat when it comes to the extras.  I was hoping for more behind the scene stuff like the screen test they teased us with on the Facebook page and am sad that other than ONE documentary, nothing is new and there's quite a few things from the Collectors Edition that didn't make its way over to the Blu Ray.  What would have been even better would have been an option to add in scenes that were deleted but no such luck.<br /><br />They are saying this is the final word in Titanic and I'm honestly a tad disappointed with this final package.  A 5 star for the movie itself and the quality of the blu ray and 3 stars for the extras.that were interesting to see.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was interesting, but when will these young writers realize that using the pre-pubescent f-bomb ad nauseum does not necessarily lend credibility and maturity to a story?
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It's a pretty cool app. I use it frequently.  It is also always accurate so you don't t have to worry about it miscalculating.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|As usual, Dr. Seuss is a movie the whole family will enjoy and it includes a great message of Earth conservation. There are some funny parts and a few catchy songs.
0316153834|4.0|The book was like new and Michael Connelly has become my favorite author. Harry Bosch is the best of all fiction characters.

B007OAAK0O|3.0|I lived right across the street from where the concert was taking place at the time.  I lived at 225 CPW(82 and Central Park West)  I was going to go to the concert the first night yet I saw the weather report and decided not to go.  I am glad, as it could of been dangerous.  I do not think  there were 800,000 people in attendance, that sounds like propaganda to me.<br /><br />I recall the day was extremely hot and humid and storms were predicted.  Within 1/2 hour of Diana taking the stage the rains came. She eventually had to stop as there was risk of lighting.  Also, the rain was horrendous.<br /><br />The second night came and people were entering the park from 81st and CPW I decided to listen from the street; which turned out to be a good thing.  After the concert ended gangs of people went into groups of \\"wolf packs\\" and began attacking people and trying to enter the buildings on Central Park West.  It was very dangerous and frightening.  I put quotes around wolf packs as that is what the press called the groups.  You can go back to the papers to check if you want to read what happened after the show.<br /><br />Then Diana was supposed to build a kids playground by the entrance of the park at 81st and CPW.  This went back and forth for years until she finally ponied up the money to make good on her commitment.<br /><br />I used to love Diana Ross, yet I find that her voice, which was pleasant and entertaining has lost its luster and she is a shadow of what she once was.  I bought this DVD, as it was an in the moment performance and she did give it her all.  I also applaud her for \\"the show must go on\\" mentality yet Diana Ross has not produced anything of note in almost a generation and has been relegated to being the entertainment at Universal theme park in Orlando this Summer.<br /><br />I hope she changes her hairdo, as she has had the same look since 1979.  Diana, needs to reinvent herself to ignite some excitement into her career.  I grew up loving The Supremes and was a huge fan until 1980.  I saw her in concert many times and was mesmerized.  Yet, after the \\"Diana\\" album, she seemed to stagnate and has not grown as an artist or actress.  I supported all her films and found the only one to be of worth was: \\"Lady Sings The Blues.\\"<br /><br />I recently saw her on the Actors Studio, which perplexed me, as she has only made 3 films.  None the less, they did have her on and she must of been excited as she had many of her Family members in attendance.  Due to the lack of film work they had to fill the hour with a mini concert for half the hour.  This was not a good night for Diana, as her voice was thin and flat.<br /><br />I think if she starts singing better material, changes her hair and sings more ballad type songs she will come back?<br /><br />No concert in Central Park, will ever compete with Barbra Streisand's: \\"A Happening in Central Park.\\"  That was in the Sheaps Meadow section of the Park.  Barbra, was and is  a true artist belting out every song with pure emotion and masterful interperative skill.  Her set was amazing and she was totally in the moment.  She actually performed for 3 hours yet the concert was truncated down to an hour for the television special and the Album.  Now you can go to youtube and see many of the songs she did that do not appear on the television special and album.  Streisand was the first artist to do a free concert in the park and hers is the definitive one to watch.<br /><br />I do [[ASIN:B000GW8RZM Barbra Streisand - A Happening in Central Park]][[ASIN:B000B9PW7G Barbra Streisand - The Television Specials]] like watching this show as I do admire Diana's tenacity to continue and I remember it like it was yesterday.  I hope she can recharge her career and start doing albums again and getting better venues to play in.  I suggest she  change the hair immediately and things will start to improve.  She really needs to go back to wearing her hair pulled back in the bun as she did before this look.  She is not 35 anymore, it looks ridiculous on her, plus it is been over 30 years since she has changed her look.  She needs to surround herself with people who can guide her, as Berry Gordy once did.<br /><br />Enjoy, the show it is the last great thing Diana Ross did as an artist and with any tenacity.<br />Samuel Freedman/Jeffrey Freedman
B000FCKGPC|1.0|I very much enjoyed the first three books in this series but this one was quite boring.  A Feast for Crows spends too much time on previously minor characters (Asha and the other Greyjoys and the sisters of a dead prince)and I had to ask myself multiple times \\"Why am I supposed to care about these people?\\".  Nothing much happens and I found the book extremely tedious and very disappointing.  Not worth the time to read it!  I hope that the next book is better.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Edited: August 2015  This is customer review number 456.  Most of the previous reviews describe past DVD (& VHS) releases of the film which are of no relevance to the Blu-ray version.  This review is about the Blu-ray version.  Some of the information given here has been taken from comments made by others about my review posted at Amazon UK.  If you buy &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; from Amazon US (All Regions) the language options are English, French (dubbed) and Japanese (dubbed) plus English, Dutch and Arabic subtitles.  If you buy from Amazon UK (Region B/2) the language options are English and Spanish (dubbed) plus English, Spanish and Hindi subtitles.  I purchased &#34;Lawrence von Arabien&#34; from Amazon.deutschland for 11.76 Euros (exc. 19% MwSt).  This Blu-ray has the original English soundtrack and complete dubbing in both German and Italian plus subtitles in English, German, Italian, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and Turkish.  A 2-disc &#34;Collector's Edition&#34; DVD was issued in 2001 with English, German and Spanish audio options (plus subtitles in 19 languages) but the German dubbing was incomplete – reverting to English in places – since the audio was taken from an earlier German release which had been greatly edited.  If the visual information provided by Amazon is enlarged it can be seen that there are four discs clearly labelled as follows: &#34;Disc 1 Feature Film&#34;, &#34;Disc 2 Special Features&#34;, &#34;Disc 3 Special Features&#34;, and &#34;Soundtrack CD&#34;.  The source for the &#34;Soundtrack CD&#34; remains unreported.  An Amazon UK review for the Tadlow Music re-recording (ASIN: B003YCM0HM) at Amazon UK tells us how &#34;the original music cues, the actual magnetic tracks that Maurice Jarre had recorded the music for LAWRENCE on, [were] thrown into the garbage.  The only way to preserve the music during the 1988 restoration by Robert Harris was by using ... the Music and Effects tracks, which somehow survived. ... the effects and music are already mixed so there is not much that can be done during a restoration remix ... Any other music would have to come from the M&E and would be full of effects but no dialogue. ...&#34;.  Another reviewer assures us that the CD included in the box set isn’t that of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra's re-recording since &#34;Sony made no effort to license out this disc and instead [used] masters that were of much lower quality for the soundtrack disc.&#34;  There are now two issues of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra's re-recording of &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; conducted by Nic Raine:  Firstly, there's ASIN B003YCM0HM – issued 21 September 2010 – by Tadlow Music which has two discs: CD 1 – &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; and CD 2 – &#34;The Music of Maurice Jarre&#34;.  Secondly, there's ASIN B008DL447S – issued 14 August 2012 – by Silva America which has just one disc with &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34;.  Those wanting to know where the film's locational shots were taken might like to refer to &#34;The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations&#34; (ISBN 1840232072) by Tony Reeves. Seville – with some over-the-top 1929 pseudo-Moorish buildings – was used to represent WWI Cairo.  I have suggested to Amazon that the Blu-ray version of &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; ought to have its own listing instead of the reviews being listed along with the other versions.  Amazon has replied as follows:  &#34;We link different editions, bindings, formats or color variations of a product in our system to make it easier for customers to find the version they're looking for.  Our intention is to provide all the relevant review information we possibly can, regardless of the version.

B0035JRVBO|5.0|A great American story with masterful acting and a hard edge at times.  I loved the role of Lt. Dan!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Good movie,lots of suspaense, but it is Liam Neeson who made this movie worthwhile. He is such a superb actor.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a total disappiontment. All the hype and publicity I just knew for sure I wouldn't be able to put this book down!! NOT! BORING!<br />I'm really disappionted that I used my Amazon gift card for such a crappy purchase. I'm glad that I only bought the one instead of the whole trilogy! I would of been trying to get a refund! Sorry E.L. I don't know who you know but I guess it worked to get you noticed. Better luck next time on keeping the readers interest!!
B0079J28NW|5.0|Yes I was very happy with the dvd. I enjoyed the movie brought back good memories.And the extras were very nice.I am so glad amazon has these classic dvd's and wil look to see what else they have to offer.
B008239FVC|1.0|We learned the hard way that the Lifeproof case is NOT waterproof.  Our 16 year old daughter wanted this case for her (two week old) iphone so that she could take pictures and videos underwater (as advertised).  She used it only twice in the pool.  The second time she used it, it leaked and now her 2 week old phone doesn't work.  The Cellular Service provider, Apple nor Lifeproof will uphold the warrenty due to water damage. They won't even offer a refund for the case.  Lifeproof wants to issue us a new case, what a joke! We purchased the product through our cellular phone service provider, not Amazon.  I would NOT recomend this product to anyone who wants to use it underwater!
0307341550|4.0|Sharp Objects is an awesome short novel of disfunction the desire of youth to fit in. Camille Preaker is a reporter who is sent to investigate the deaths and disappearances of two young girls in the small town she grew up in. To do so Camille must go home to her mother, stepsister and stepfather and the ghost of another sister who died young. Camille is also a cutter. A young woman who cuts words into her body for each traumatic event in her life. A diary of time cut into her skin.<br />Sharp Objects is a fast moving drama with a nice tidy mystery layered in the disfunction and cruelty of small town affluent culture. Camille weaves her way through the townspeople and her own family with the tired disdain of one who had thought she had gotten away.<br />Gillian Flynn shows a wonderful ability to make you care about characters who can't seem to care for themselves.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have an email account with yahoo & wanted it on my Kindle so I can stay in touch when I'm not on the actual desk top or laptop. I don't feel that I should have had to install it specifically through amazon, but I could never get my emails unless I did.
B0083GOPSG|3.0|Way too short...it's an interesting story but really not to depth needed for this type of concept.  I'd consider it decent short entertainment but otherwise...there are other better choices.
0802473156|5.0|This book drove home such important concepts for me.  It helped me put into words the frustration I have been having with a \\"dying\\" relationship and facilitated moving through and out of it with caring, love, and acceptance.  Now onto to one where we BOTH will practice these simple, clear, and oh so valuable tools.  Thank you!!
B008B11R1Q|4.0|The XX returns with their signature low-fi, hauntingly romantic music. Switching between female and male vocal leads, so much emotion is carried with thoughtful repetition and harmonies. Each note seems purposefully placed, drum beats come in and out so you never get too comfortable with the beat. The rhythm is consistent even without drums though, so the music never strays too far from the listener's comfort zone. This music creates a haunting, nearly spiritual atmosphere up there with the best post-rock bands, like Sigur Ros and The National, while remaining sharp and brief around 3 minutes per song.<br /><br />Best of all, the album works equally well as a cohesive whole or as a series of singles, making it appropriate for nearly all forms of listening.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. It enables me to pin endlessly when I should be productive...just like the real site. Everything is the same + an added feature of returning to where you were before you pinned something.
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|If your a Sci-Fi fan this was rather enjoyable.  It's a fun ride through a beautiful world.  Yes, the story is light but definite worthy of the time to get away for a bit of good escapee entertainment!

B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is the first book I have read from Kate Morton.  I stumbled across her on this site a few days ago.  I'm glad I decided to purchase for my Kindle.  The story is well written, and makes reference to books I also enjoyed as a child (Secret Garden and Famous Five's Five go to Smugglers Top)<br /><br />What had peaked my interest was one of the reviewers comparing it to The Secret Garden. Personally I don't agree with the comparison.  I absolutely enjoyed the way the author switched from past to present, describing the characters and the scenes vividly.  I admit, I found it diffucult to put down for just a minute, even when my Kindle needed charging.  I eventually figured out the main plot before I got to the end, and I finished reading the entire novel in three days!!!!! Can't wait to read the other novels!!!!
B0000E5NPZ|3.0|Bonjour Tristresse, 1958 film<br /><br />The movie begins with a view of Paris. \\"This is the best day of my life!\\" Cecile goes for a drive in a British sports car [displaying her wealth].There is a soiree, dancing to live music. \\"What a waste of time.\\" A song tells of sadness. She remembers last year on the Riviera. [The film changes to color.] She and her father Raymond wake up. Elsa has sunburn. There is small talk. \\"Jewels or furs?\\" Cecile meets a young man, a law student. He is serious and from Paris. Crickets say the same thing over and over. [Just like some people?] Anne will visit, she was a friend of Cecile's mother. We see people dancing at a club. [Note their manners.] Do clothing styles make a woman look younger? Anne hears news that upsets her! \\"Occupied territory?\\" Anne talks to Elsa. Do explanations create complications?<br /><br />Anne stayed, the maids liked her. Everyone was nice to each other. They dance at a nightclub. [This pads out the film.] Raymond kisses Anne. In the morning they water-ski. Elsa taks about playing craps at the casino. She does, and wins a lot of money. Luck? They talk to a rich man from South America. Raymond wants Anne. \\"How long would it last?\\" \\"Be reasonable.\\" Elsa's luck changed. Vanilla ice cream to cure a hangover? Is it a good idea for Anne to marry Raymond? \\"That makes me so happy.\\" Anne finds Cecile and Philip together, she sends him away. New management? Shouldn't Cecile study for her exams? Yes, says Raymond. Spoiled, willful, and lazy? Will Cecile plot against Anne? Elsa tells of her love for Raymond. Philip wants to marry Cecile. But they must get rid of Anne. Did Cecile lie about studying? She goes to meet Philip. Later she smokes a cigarette. Anne plans changes for Raymond.<br /><br />Should you drop people if you don't like them? [Probably yes.] You hear the small talk at the table. Cecile talks to Raymond about Anne. Elsa tells Cecile her plan is working. Will Cecile visit the Lombards? No. Where will Anne go? She finds Elsa and Raymond together and hears their talk! Angry, Anne drives away. Raymond is remorseful, then gets a telephone call. There was another accident! Anne's car went off the road at a curve, there were seven earlier accidents that summer. She never heard from Philip again. Elsa left for South America. Raymond is up to his old tricks again. Cecile is alone again with her memories. \\"Hello sadness.\\"<br /><br />But we know that at that age things will change again. This novel by Francoise Sagan was a best seller in the 1950s. Was it shockingly scandalous for that era? Or a warning about a too-close relationship between a father and his daughter? Is a womanizer ever a good marriage match? This movie tells about life for a certain strata of society. Is it a warning about the idle rich? [Maybe they all should have gone on the \\"Jerry\\" show to discuss their relationships and warn the viewers.]
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Absolutely fantastic game!  Makes you think and work really hard to get the best score possible.  Very creative and fun to play.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just started watching Downton Abbey this year. I had to catch up and it was a pleasure doing so. In fact, I was addicted. When I was all caught up I was bummed out. I cannot wait for the series to begin again in January. It is well done, great cast of characters and love the story line.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I love Ms. Morton's work!  The story was told from the point of view of an elderly woman who led an interesting life that began at Riverton.  The residents of Riverton were portrayed as secretive, intriguing, and so fascinating!  The story captured my attention and I found it difficult to put it down.  I could not wait to find out what was going to happen next in the \\"present day\\" life of the woman telling the story and of course the shocking events that occurred at Riverton.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This it is a fun puzzle game. Some levels are hard and some are too easy.its a nice mix of both. When ever I am bored this fills my time.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love all of the Twilight movies, but this one is by far my favorite. I love that Bella and Edward get married, and love the whole honeymoon part. It's super romantic!

B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I don't get why people go to movies anymore nothing is good enough for them. Every review is the same oh K.S.'s avting was and it was that of you all were such great judges of tallent Hollywood would be knocking your door down instead of looking how you can rip a movie apart and sound so uptight that a snob would be scare of. Man dose a non critic have to try to be Sickle or Egbert sorry if I speed your names wrong. Come on don't write a review that will turn all off give your options but don't trash people that your yourself couldn't do better then. Every day people need to remember that not everyone is as critical as you. Where others saw light acting (I won't rag on someone just to make myself fell superior when I can not do better myself) from Kristen Stewart I saw a young actress take another step into hopefully becomeing a next gen Sandra Bullock I am not putting her there yet, but I she like everyone has to have time to grow. I saw a enjoyable movie that brings to the big screen a version or snow white that it sounds like not many people knew about, I'm not a child anymore so I don't want the snow white we all grew up on. Kristen Stewart did a nice job I thought of bring snow white out of the kiddies section and up to a more adult level is her acting prefect no but who's is? I took the movie differently then most I saw all the actor's feeding off each other and also helpping weaker sceane stronger, there was chemistry between Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth and also the other billing Charlize Thereon did a great nod as the evil Queen and the shot with the two main actresses was also very good?, all in all don't think I found anyone unlikeable nor did I not not enjoy this movie. The FX shots were top of the line I wounded if maken the movie a non 3D outing hurt it? I was happy there was no odd tint to the movie or no over done music. You can start to see connection to the snow white we all know. But I'm just not willing to tell people not to see somethingthey may en joy. I go by one rule was I entertained or was I not? I would say yes. Then the next was it worth what I payed to see it? Again I say yes and with this I give the only input I can honestly give or say. I was interested in seeing it,  so I saw it should you that is up to you if you saw the Tv spots or coming attractions and you think you want to see it then yes watch it, if not then don't. If you want to know if I was entertained? Yes I was I enjoyed this move and all the actor's & actresses,  if you want to know if you should see it yes if you are interested in yes give it a shot but remember now one twisted your arm to see it so don't take you dislike of a movie turn in a bash-a-thon. Try going to a movie just to be entertained not so you can show everyone hot you can tear apart other people's work,  you wouldn't want someone to do it your work that you do.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Quick read about a man that starts out to mail a letter to a friend from his past.  A friend/co-worker who is dying of cancer and he never had an opportunity to properly say good-bye.  He receives a letter with her devastating news and goes to mail a reply, but doesn't stop at the mail-box, just keeps on walking. He walks with his boat shoes on his feet and no supplies.<br /><br />The story is about the people he meets, and the thoughts that envelop him as he walks.  Thoughts about his past relationships.  As he travels he evolves into a man that is quite different from the one that started the journey.<br /><br />There is also the story of the wife, Maureen, and their relationship.  He left her behind with no explanation when he just keeps going past the mailbox.  He does telephone her and keeps in touch, but she does not understand the rationale for the mission.  She too evolves as Harold is walking.  So in the end when the reunite at the end of Harold's journey, they have grown together again.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Like some other reviewers I wasn't sure if I would like this album.  As soon as I listened I was hooked.  The homage to Neil Young is evident and nostalgically wonderful.  I hear licks within other songs paying tribute to everyone from BB King to the Beatles. John and I hail from the same East Coast hometown, went to the same high school even.  Believe me, our town is not a hotbed of soul, country or the blues. Somehow, somewhere John absorbed a multitude of influences and nuances that defy our rather homogenous town. Rock on Homeboy,  you do us proud.

0525953728|5.0|Mark Owen's inside look at the Navy Seals and the mission that brought down Osama Bin Laden is a must read for every American. If you read this book with an open mind with no expectations, it will not disappoint.<br /><br />From his early days of training to his final mission, this book details the hard life of a Navy Seal and what it takes to be the best. His presentation is humble yet honest. I did not feel this book was political in any way and being just an ordinary citizen, did not notice any information that would violate national security and this view has been upheld by other military personel that have read this book.<br /><br />I also saw his interview on 60 minutes and felt he gave credit to the other members of his unit which includes the pilots and the CIA. Did not sense any ego from this man. He just gave his views and honest feelings.<br /><br />Some other reviewers are comparing this book to other books of similiar content. I didn't know this was a competition. This may not have been what some of these reviewers were looking for, but for me, I was just interested in what really happened on this mission that brought down the world's most famous terrorist.<br /><br />Wishing Mark Owen and all of the Navy Seals the best and thank you for your service and keeping America safe.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best of all three books. I read this one in one night. I couldn't put it down for wanting to know what was going to happen next.... I'm going to reread this one before the movie comes out next year...
B004X4QW42|5.0|Excellent movie on Wing Chun. Excellent story and fighting scenes. The ending was surprising and very fulfilling. Five star a must.
B008F1NICI|5.0|Rock music that combines emotion, angst, pain and romance. Songs covering the subjectivity of that which cannot be seen but what the heart really feels. Does it get any better ?. And can anyone do it better ?.<br /><br />Combine all this with atmospherics, some incredible guitar touches, strings, a choir and a sympathetic rhythm section. Listen even close and you will also hear that wonderful rumble of hammond organ on a couple of tracks. The result, a truly remarkable album which is, at times, quite beautiful, stunning and breathtaking. Not only that. It is also leaves the listener totally drained.<br /><br />With this record Bruce appears to have captured the very best elements of Tightly Unwound and Someone Here Is Missing which, themselves were both extremely good albums, and combined them with the essence and the spirit of the pre K-Scope albums. Yet, at the same time, the music is certainly not to be viewed as a step back into the past. It is as if both worlds have collided and this masterpiece has been created.<br /><br />'All the Wars' is a deeply meaningful album and despite the occasional full on musical assault to the senses both the music and lyrics are actually quite delicate and incredibly heartfelt and sensitive. In a strange and perverse kind of way it does seem to come across as an act of penance. It is not a concept album as such but rather an album that should be listened to as a whole.<br /><br />The art form Bruce has created and adopted here is, to me at least, a totally unique strand of rock music. By that I am trying to say that it has not gone into a world of it's own. It is not anthemic and neither are their any displays of needless virtuoso. The subject matter is, I think, very different to what you would expect from a rock album. These are day to day emotions as experienced by anyone in a similar situation. The creator does not live in a far away bubble. Like ours, his feet are still planted firmly on the ground. Maybe more so.<br /><br />The songs are the results of internal wrestling and personal battles. The juggling of family and work life over a creative energy that is bursting to get out. They pour out love and are, at times, almost apologetic for this never ending conflict. They seek forgiveness for the continual frustration. Bruce, I think, is now renowned for having few lyrics to his songs yet at the same time those lyrics seem to say so much.<br /><br />The power and intensity of this album sucks the listener in and seduces them into seemingly being a part of it all. Together the songs ebb and flow, peak and dip and ultimately build into a huge crescendo. The addition of real strings are, at times, almost beatlesque and, along with the production, I think even the great George Martin would be purring with satisfaction at the results given here.<br /><br />I have always view The Pineapple Thief music as a similar effect to that you would get from a journey through a tunnel. You enter from a position of light and as you travel along to the darkest part your mind is toyed with. You see the light at the end of the tunnel. And finally the daylight hits you and you come out of it feeling all the more cleansed and refreshed for the experience. As a listener you seem to get dragged into the guilt and angst and, at times, the music becomes incidental.<br /><br />I must admit that when the reports began to filter in during the recording of the album, I was thinking that the subtleties would be lost on an average listener such as myself. Would I appreciate the benefits of recording in a proper studio in Lincolnshire vs the attic at home. But the power and grandeur really is there for all to hear. This whole album, the whole concept, the music and the lyrics really is quite something else.<br /><br />But as much as I enjoy his rock style I equally enjoy Bruce's acoustic leanings. So, as with a great deal of albums, I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall at the embryonic stages of these songs. And, guess what, you get a flavour of those early strummings by way of an additional bonus acoustic disc.<br /><br />To produce something of this magnitude requires a telepathic understanding of what the final goal is and the way it is to be achieved. So credit must be given to the whole band.<br /><br />He describes it as the definitive TPT album. But, for me, to be able to create something of this quality is a minor miracle given the circumstances and constraints that Bruce writes and records under. This was a hugely anticipated release and delivers on every angle.<br /><br />I absolutely adore this album. Bruce has now set his own bar to an incredibly high level. It certainly left me wondering just how this record can ever be matched. But at the same time I wouldn't bet against him doing it.<br /><br />In short, just allow yourself to absorb this album rather than quickly dismiss it because it does not fit a particular sub category of your favourite genre of music.
0142413860|2.0|I bought with book with the idea that it was going to help my children with reading like the books we had as kids. I loved this book as a kid!  So to my dismay, they don't have a \\"beep\\" sound to signal the kids to turn the page.  This lead to major frustration with my son who is learning to read but wanted to at least keep up with the story.  He was listening but was on the wrong page and said he didn't like the book b/c he was \\"getting lost\\".  Too bad the removed the page turning notification, b/c I would have given it 5 stars!  Just buy the book and read it aloud yourself b/c by the time they can read themselves they arent going to want someone else to read it!

B005DI66N4|5.0|In 1941 the author, a young Polish soldier, was captured by the Soviet Red Army and sent to a forced labor camp in the Russian Far East, some 300 miles from the Arctic Circle.  He covered the last 1000 miles to the camp on foot--in winter.  Then, in one of the few successful attempts ever recorded from the northern camps, he and a few teammates escaped.  They made their way south across Russia, Mongolia and the Gobi Desert, across Tibet and over the Himalays, to freedom in India--more than 2000 miles away, all on foot.  Then they rejoined the Free Polish Forces to fight on against Nazi Germany.  Such physical, mental and spiritual endurance has rarely, if ever, been surpassed.  The account is written in simple understated prose and is only 241 pages in length.  Recommended for adults and college and secondary school students.
B0006GANN2|3.0|The French Connection (William Friedkin, 1971, 104')<br /><br />American dramatic thriller. Stars Gene Hackman, Fernando Rey and Roy Scheider. Adapted and fictionalized by Ernest Tidyman from  non-fiction book by Robin Moore. Tells the story of New York Police Department detectives \\"Popeye\\" Doyle and Buddy \\"Cloudy\\" Russo, whose real-life counterparts were Narcotics Detectives Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso. Egan and Grosso also appear in the film, but as characters other than themselves.<br /><br />The film revolves around the smuggling of narcotics between Marseilles and New York City. In Marseilles a policeman is staking out Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), a heroin smuggler. The policeman is killed by Pierre Nicoli, Charnier's henchman (Marcel Bozzuffi). In New York, detectives James \\"Popeye\\" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy \\"Cloudy\\" Russo (Roy Scheider) are conducting an undercover stakeout in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.<br /><br />Charnier soon \\"makes\\" Doyle and realizes he has been observed since his arrival in New York. Nicoli offers to kill Doyle; Charnier objects - killing one policeman will not amount to anything, he argues, but Nicoli says they will be in France well before they can be detained. Nicoli botches the killing of Doyle and ends up hijacking an elevated train.<br /><br />In one of the greatest car chase sequences in movie history, Popeye grabs a civilian's car (a 1971 Pontiac LeMans) and frantically chases that elevated train. The scene was filmed in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn roughly running under the BMT West End Line (currently the D train, then the B train) which runs on an elevated track in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the 62nd Street station after the train crashed into another train up ahead. Popeye finally catches up with and manages to shoot Nicole.<br /><br />It was the first R-rated movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture since the introduction of the MPAA film rating system. It also won Academy Awards for Best Actor (Gene Hackman), Best Director, Best Film Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Ernest Tidyman). Best Cinematography and Best Sound. Tidyman also received a Golden Globe Award, a Writers Guild of America Award and an Edgar Award for his screenplay.<br /><br />Title cards before the closing credits note that Joel Weinstock and Angie Boca got away without prison time while Lou Boca got a reduced sentence and Devereaux served four years. Charnier was never caught. Both Doyle and Russo were transferred out of the narcotics division. Just as if anybody really cared.<br /><br />Despite all the praise and prizes heaped on it, nothing is as right as the film's accounts: from a budget of $m2 to box office revenue of $m52! Not too bad for mostly kiddy stuff - acting, driving and otherwise. R-rating would hardly still be needed today; all looks quite tame.<br /><br />156us The French Connection (William Friedkin, 1971, 104') - 12/9/2012Gene Hackman), Best Director, Best Film Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Ernest Tidyman).

B000FC0SIM|5.0|This is the book on writing you always wished for. It's not a bunch of fluffy, \\"You can do it, just do it!\\" drivel, but real pragmatic techniques that Stephen King uses to craft a story. King explains so vividly, it's almost as if you're looking over his shoulder as he bangs away on his keyboard. The first part of the book is about his early life up until the publishing of \\"Carrie\\" which gives you a glimpse of the circumstances that built the author. Highly recommended read for all writers, or those who wanna be.

B006PTL1QM|2.0|This film has great production value under the helm of veteran producer Jeremy Thomas.  However after sitting through the whole film, I was not impressed by this \\"dangerous method\\" suggested by Freud to Jung for treating a Russian woman played by Keira Knightly who \\"suffered a bit\\" under the dirctorial hands of David Cronenburg.  Poor choice, she is no Russian, if you ask me.  Viggo Mortensen although not a bit resembles Freud, gave a very impressive performance while the headliner  Michael Fassbinder(a good actor in many recent films) walks through the film seeming  a bit lost.  Under directed by Cronenburg?  A cold and unfulfilling film.

B003SWNRU2|5.0|Blood Of The Nations is the twelfth studio album by the legendary German Metal band Accept, and their first since reforming and hiring Mark Tornillo, formerly of TT Quick, on lead vocals.<br /><br />Despite it being the band's twelfth record, it has all the energy and power of a brand new band's debut and would serve as a fine introduction to the legendary band for any new fan and could either inspire you to check out the back catalogue, or along with its follow-up record `Stalingrad,' serve as half of an absolutely perfect discography from the theoretical new band. Additionally, for existing fans it has proven to be a damned fine comeback album, getting a lot of rave reviews and positive fan reaction.<br /><br />Stylistically speaking there really isn't any better way to describe the material other than as true Heavy Metal, plain and simple. Even if it does risk making you sound a bit like a music snob. Its that part of the Metal spectrum that forms the basis for the early types of Power, Thrash and Progressive Metal without actually leaning especially heavily into the defining characteristics that separate each subgenre from plain old Metal itself, although at the same time occasionally its more powerful, thrashier and even a little proggier than some of the early albums in each of those respective genres before they found their niche.<br /><br />Regardless of the style however, it is just a remarkably well written and enjoyable Metal album that has a satisfying production job, courtesy of Andy Sneap, as well as a lot of virtuosic displays of musicianship and great vocals all around that can recall Lemmy at one moment, Halford at another and then former Accept singer Udo the next moment.<br /><br />Crunchy riffs, impressive solos and memorable vocal patterns are what this album is all about, and it delivers them in enough permutations of speed, softness, fun and seriousness to both keep the listener engaged and leave them satisfied at the album's conclusion.  It has a both a fairly instant appeal as well as definitely being a `grower' of a record that rewards repeat listening relatively well, and I highly recommend checking it out.as a both a fairly instant appeal as well as definitely being a `grower' of a record that rewards repeat listening relatively well, and I highly recommend checking it out.
B006H5120E|1.0|I received this product on Monday and went to watch it, at least part one, last night. Put it in the player and it got past the start screen and then went supposedly to the menu and locked my player up. Only way out was to shut the player down and turn it back on to get the disk out. Tried the second disk and it worked once but never again. Tried a different 3D movie in my player to make sure my player was still working and it worked flawlessly. I also connected my player to the internet and checked for software updates for which there were none. Also, the one time the second disk did work I started the movie to watch it and it had the worst ghosting I had ever seen on my system for a 3D movie.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone.
B0087DFIYA|3.0|The director of this film was Mel's assistant director on \\"Apocalypco\\".  Mel acted in his directorial debut indicates Mel's loyalty to his crew.  This is a well-directed crime (does pay) film with a large unfamilar-looking but impressive Mexican cast and boasts one of the nastiest prison commune ever put on a film.  Mel as usual gave everything he has to his film and always a joy and exciting watching him act.  This film has a problem.  It could be the script.  Even with a \\"happy\\" ending, it doesn't give the viewer a sense of fulfillment after almost 2 hrs of car chase, blood, drugs and gritty life in a Mexican prison.  Don't stop Mel, we look forward to your next one!
B00005JPD0|4.0|Deja Vu(released Nov/06)stars Denzel Washington as  ATF agent Doug Carlin,Val Kilmer as FBI agent Paul Pryzwarra and James Caviezel as Carroll Oerstadt,the bomber.This is a taut thriller set in today but with an intriguing futuristic twist,guaranteed to keep you enthralled from beginning to end.<br />The setting is New Orleans and the place there is the Algiers Ferry dock.The ferry is loaded with armed forces personnel out in celebration and shortly after it leaves the dock,there is a huge explosion,condemning over 500 souls to their doom.Enter agent Carlin who is there investigating the carnage.He is an agent who is extremely on the ball and attention to detail is his fort&eacute;.<br />During his probing a woman's body is found washed up on a nearby shore.It is first assumed it is just another body from the explosion,but its`placement on shore in conjunction to the boats demise is impossible as it would have to have floated there against the tide.Not only that but the ends of the fingers of one hand have been removed.Carlin attends the autopsy to find out the body was evidently placed there before the explosion and had nothing to do with the ferry blast;or did it?<br />Enter FBI man Pryzwarra who entreats Carlin to join in their investigation.He takes Carlin to some office where a group of folks are looking at seemingly real time four day old footage of the ferry,from any angle they choose and with sound.He is first told this is just new satellite techno stuff,but the explanation doesn't sit well with him.He goes along only so far until they are looking at the woman whose body was found,and who they have since identified,but is now alive,being,supposedly,four days before.The woman comments that she thinks she's being watched.Carlin pulls out a laser pen and points it into the picture,and the woman sees it.Carlin realizes what he is seeing is more than what they're telling him.It is finally revealed that this is top secret technology government researchers stumbled upon previously,and are now using for the first time here.<br />With Carlin fully in the picture,as it were,he is now able to identify the bomber,arrest him and learn what his steps were before and leading up the actual event.The team also sends Carlin a message into the past to help him stop the bombing before it happened,but it doesn't reach him and instead his partner gets it,and gets himself killed following the lead.Carlin then asks for himself to be sent back in time.Although never done with a human before he takes a terrible risk.He travels back to the day of the bombing but at a hospital,where he is revived as his heart stopped,as it was feared would happen.Once out of the hospital he saves the woman and together they tackle the problem at hand;stopping the bomber.They arrive at the ferry dock and the woman disobeys Carlin's pleadings to stay behind.She gets captured and tied to the steering wheel of the truck with explosives in it,but between her and Carlin they take the bomber down.They drive the truck off the ferry but only the women escapes and Carlin gets killed in the explosion.<br />In the aftermath the woman is told by authorities to sit tight while an agent is coming to interrogate her about the explosion.The agent comes and the movie fades to black.<br />The movie,produced in conjunction with Jerry Bruckheimer,is well crafted and ably directed by Tony Scott.The film is in an off colour sepia-like tone which enhances the movies feel throughout.Washington has got game as has the entire cast.I always like movies that start out going in one direction but branch off and head in another,and this is one of them.The original Predator,where a group of army types is on a rescue mission and are later fighting for their lives against of all things,an alien,is just one example.This movie starts off as a \\"routine\\" investigation of a terrorist act in New Orleans,then suddenly vaults into the realm of Sci Fi with the use of secret government controlled time travel.And thanks to the great direction and editing,and attention to detail,the film works on alot of different levels.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:35:1.It's clear and crisp and includes commentary,a featurette,and deleted and extended scenes.<br />All in all a highly recommended bit of filmmaking by the late Tony Scott(I never thought I would be saying that about a director whose works I really admired),who passed much too soon.This film will have you on the edge of your seats from start to finish.thanks to the great direction and editing,and attention to detail,the film works on alot of different levels.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:35:1.It's

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle does an excellent job of bringing the reader into the SEAL life and the training that goes with it,  Like Carlos Hathcock before him, Kyle had learned to shoot as a youngster and the U.S. military has always relied on men from hunting backgrounds for its elite units.  With The Brady Bunch and other anti-gun nuts like Mayor Bloomberg running around and trying to disarm Americans, one wonders if that tradition will endure.<br /><br />To his credit, Kyle injects some genuine humor into what is, at its root, a grim subject, he strikes a good balance and including his wife's take on events was a nice touch.<br /><br />Excellent read!

Many business books draw on the author's experiences at only one or two companies but this one is based on much broader experiences.

B003Y3ZHUS|5.0|Picture Quality really was quite a treat, I didn't realize how rough around the edge's the DVD transfer actually was until I viewed the Blu-Ray. If you already own the film and are debating whether you should upgrade or not, I would definitely upgrade as you won't be disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best of the three books. Kept me at the edge of my seat, this book gets pretty intense. Would buy again and again!

B000FCKGPC|5.0|All 5 books are awesome, maybe complicated at some parts but great. Im tho more of Tolkien fan but i like this too, as long its fantasy. Anyway i recommend purchase to all who didn't read Martins yet, maybe its a little heavier at the beginning but the reading gets fun and enjoyable. I bought the book at Amazon Kindle and its 5 stars of 5. Im from Slovenia (Europe) and had no problems with the purchase.

B008B1VYP0|5.0|One of the better Maroon 5 albums.Like alot of their music,but the wife thinks this album rocks. Hopefully the next release will be as good.
034580404X|5.0|I thought the books were very interesting.  The first edition was a little over the top, the second was better and the thrid was the best.
B008OHV5HS|5.0|I was saddened by the death of Mac and wasn't sure if Damian would live up to their new material. I was wrong. Damien delivers a great performance on this record and the band delivers musically as they always do. While not as heavy as Dead Reckoning it still has a lot of great moments and is worthy of being part of the mighty threshold catalog. Welcome Back Guys!
B008M34INW|4.0|I like Gibson so I may be biased a little, but I enjoyed \\"Get the Gringo\\". Plenty of \\"action\\" which I always expect from his stuff. His helping a mother and child was good, the ending reminded me a little of \\"Payback\\", another of my favorites by Mel.<br />All in all, a good, action show.
B00000J0O2|5.0|The HP3906A ink cartridge I ordered was reasonably-priced, shipped promptly, and arrived quickly.  As advertised, it was in its original retail packaging and was exactly as ordered. I especially liked the free UPS return label for recycling the old cartridge.

B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was so hard for me to read. I love to read! I would read a book a day if I had time for it - this book is one that I wanted to put down and never pick up again. I forced myself to finish it since I was reading it for a book club, but I won't have a rave review at our next meeting....sorry, just not my style.
B005D0RDIE|1.0|I ordered this dvd as a gift. The receiver of the gift just now tried to play it, and there is no sound. It's too late to return the item, so it was a waste.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love the cover. It looks like it might be a little cheap and flimsy, but it has held up great. I have had mine almost a month and still love it. I wondered how it would stay put, but it snaps in and holds tight. Would recommend to anyone. I also like the black band that you can slip your hand in to hold onto it while you read. The bendable stand also works really well, you can use in almost anywhere but it works best on a hard surface.

0307887448|5.0|A great book that sucks the reader in from the first few pages. Love the references to the 80s, and the storyline is great.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This films deserves more than a 3 star average rating. I thought there must have been something wrong with the Blu-Ray, but it's just a bunch of people offended by Malick's challenging style. I don't know what you people were expecting. He's been making these kinds of films since day one. That's like assaulting the Amazon listing of Will Farrell's latest low-brow movie because you felt shocked and offended that it was a low-brow comedy. What the hell else did you expect? Did people seriously go into the Tree of Life expecting a Ron Howard Oscar-bait flick? When the phrase \\"from the director of The Thin Red Line\\" pops up everywhere, that should tell you all you need to know. Good lord.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Highly recommend this.  Many versions and nice features-and who can beat the price?!  Easy to use.  I like the extra devotional features as well.

B007SGM084|2.0|I see this set as one work divided three ways to make the most money. The parts struggle to stand alone. Granted this book goes into great detail (several times) describing how BDSM works, there are better choices out there.  It slams home the idea that this lifestyle can only be enjoyed by people that are \\"damaged.\\" The sex scenes are only okay and not as many as I would normally pay $30 for.  I both read and heard mixed reviews but for my money I definately feel cheated. If you enjoy steamy cannot put down because of the electric arc coming off the pages - don't bother with this one. Maybe if you need to see the rules several times and are interested in ... nope not even then.

0525953728|4.0|Mark Owen of the US Naval Special Warfare Development Group (SEAL Team Six) has written the first book about the killing of Osama Bin Laden by one who participated in the operation.  Actually, the book is mostly about his career as a SEAL and the final chapters deal with the Bin Laden operation.  Those chapters follow his first hand telling of prior such actions.  Further, there has been much talk in the press about \\"secrets\\" being revealed perhaps.  Yet, in the forward, Owen clearly states that he had a military lawyer vet everything in the book and nothing is reveal that isn't in the public domain or press.  The book, however, is a good addition to this genre.  Readers come away with a better picture of what SEALs do and their contributions to the nation's defense.  It has exciting passages and insights into how the members of SEAL Team Six prepared for the encounter with Bin Laden are instructive.  If you have an interest in reading the first book out - buy it and turn some pages.  If you are expecting a lot of secret information about US operations, you might be disappointed.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|This is a great album.  Compared to his former 60s counterparts he is miles ahead.  He doens't have the edge he had when he was 25 but who does?  The music is still miles ahead of people half his age.  And the great thing is, he has not given up.  Unlike the Rolling Stones, he doesn't just do what he does for the money.  He is more like Jeff Beck.  They still like music.  Dylan is having a ball on this album, with his uncanny ability to turn a phrase.<br /><br />But, this is not a good place to jump into the pool.  If you have never heard Dylan before go out and get Blood on the Tracks - that is always my recommendation for a good first album.  That will ease you in to Bob's music.  Hopefully we can get a new generation of Dylan fans - like about high school age.  But this album will please every Dylan fan.
0385344333|1.0|I have enjoyed the Reacher series quite a bit and have read them all more than once.  But I was very disappointed in this one.  The plot is convoluted, un-necessarily obscure and ploddingly slow.  Lots of time in cars.  Endless commentary on the virtues of the Ford Crown Vic.  And no action until the very end.  The author must know that an effort like this one is going to be characterized either as just written for the money or as proof that he has run out of inspiration.  Also, why would anyone persist in using the diminutive Tom Cruise in the movie role when fans almost universally reject him as having anything to do with the Reacher character?
B0061PEAUY|5.0|My expectations for older detective fiction series tend not to be especially high because there is only so much character development and so many ways a story can be told. Relationships between recurring characters stagnate, promising characters are never seen again, and the plots stop being interesting.<br /><br />This has not happened in the Temperance Brennan series. Tempe's relationships show organic change and tension; her professional life seems realistic; and Kathy Reichs knows how to move beyond the gee-whiz technology and dodgy science to show common sense and critical thinking. And, finally, Reichs gives a sense of place so that the reader feels like the place is a character, and that is especially true in this novel.<br /><br />It's really easy to start \\"phoning it in\\" but Reichs hasn't done that, and it shows

B008B0QH5S|1.0|I have been a fan of the PSB for many many years, since the very first time I heard West End Girls.  They have certainly had their ups and downs during their long career and like any musical act, some albums have been great while others have simply been mediocre.  But, they have never recorded what I would actually call a bad album.  Until Now.  To describe Elysium as bad, is simply not enough.  This is the most boring, uninspired, meandering album I have ever heard.  It took me four attempts to listen to it from start to finish. I'm not kidding when I say I fell asleep during the first two attempts, and that during the third, I was so disappointed in it, I simply shut it off.  There is not one song on this album that stays with you, or gets inside your head.  The boys came to LA to work with producer Andrew Dawson, best known for his work with Kanye West.  My first instinct was to place the blame for this debacle on his shoulders, but the PSB's are far too of an established act to allow a producer to steer them down a path they do not want to follow.  Clearly, this is the album they wanted to make, which just makes the end result that much more frustrating.  Knowing that they are capable of producing such engaging, upbeat, fun and interesting music, I just cannot fathom how they thought anyone would enjoy this rhythmless schlock.  Hopefully they choose not  to tour for this record, as these songs would be incredibly boring live, and maybe they will get around to their next album faster if they stay off the road.  I remain a fan, and I am all for artistic growth and expression, but for now boys, this is one fan who will be sticking with \\"Your Old Stuff\\".

0345803485|1.0|Copied review from another site:<br /><br />\\"The story of convicted child rapist Jerry Sandusky is well known.  So too is the 50 Shades of Grey phenomena, a book that has become so popular among women that some are referring to it as \\"Mommy Porn\\" for the masses.  That description is actually a lot more disturbing than a lot of folks are currently realizing.<br />Yes, 50 Shades is pornography. Like most pornography, the storyline is weak, the characters one-dimensional, while the sex itself graphic, detailed, but formulaic.  The underlying theme to 50 Shades is something far more sinister and appalling though than your mere run-of-the-mill porn.  It is pedophilia.  It is child porn.  Kiddie porn.<br />Now I know after saying that, many female fans of 50 Shades, many of them mothers, will naturally put up a defense against that kind of description.  These women, being mothers, are naturally wired to protect kids.  People like Jerry Sandusky are viewed with hatred, revulsion, and disgust.  Rightfully so.  What mother would want to condone anything having to do with the sexual abuse of children?  Of innocents?<br />But that is exactly what 50 Shades of Grey is really about.  It is a story of a girl being sexually molested, over and over again, by a male figure with all the power, all the control.  It is the classic abuse scenario.  And mothers are, in some cases, quite literally getting off on it, which takes the disgust of this phenomena to a whole other frightening level.<br />So having put that out there, and I hope I haven't lost any of you just yet.  I owe you an explanation after having made that kind of accusation about a book some of you may be reading right now.  I'll start with a bit of background first.<br />My professional experience centers around nearly 20 years with Child Protective Services.  Over that time, I've seen situations that do, literally, keep me up at night.  The amount of abuse that is going on in our society, that sexualization of our kids...well basically, what you hear about, what is reported in the news, that is only a small sample of just how large of a problem and the disgusting acts that are going on every day.  Kids are being raped.  Kids are being abused.  Every single day.  Over and over and over again.<br />I didn't seek out 50 Shades of Grey.  It was brought to my attention by a longtime friend who is also a clinical psychologist at a university.  She's a bit older than me.  She grew up in the counter culture era and did her fair share of experimentation of all kinds.  So she's hardly a prude.  What she today though is a mother and grandmother.  And she's smart.  One of the things that fascinates her is this age of cultural phenomena.  How due to technology things now spread so quickly throughout society and become the next big thing at an increasingly rapid pace.  She says sometimes this phenomena is pretty much harmless, and other times it can be very damaging to kids and or adults who begin to emulate something out of a need to belong to the \\"next big thing\\".<br />Her reaction to 50 Shades of Grey though was much more aggressively negative than anything I could recall her talking about before.  It came up because I mentioned it to her offhand.  I had seen a couple mentions of it on the news and knowing her interest in cultural trends, asked her about it.  She stopped talking, looked right at me, and said the book was about pedophilia.  And it was her who then connected it to the Sandusky tragedy where so many young boys had been sexually abused. Sandusky committed his acts of crime under the cover of actually helping youth.  That is how he gained access.  My friend said 50 Shades was basically the same exact thing.  Its cover was a story of a young woman engaging is a very graphic sexual relationship with a somewhat older man.<br />The problem for her, and it was a BIG PROBLEM, was that the narrator in the story, was in fact, an underage girl.  My friend indicated, based on the use of language in the narration, that this girl was likely no more than 12 or 13 years of age.  I made mention that the girl in the story was actually getting ready to graduate college.  My friend, a woman with years of experience as a clinical psychologist, whose expertise I had personally witnessed a number of times over the years, shook her head and told me that she would not be able to convince me by simply talking about it.  She said I should read the book myself, but do so with the eyes of somebody whose job it had been for many years to try and protect children.  As someone who has seen over and over the signs of abuse, and the damages of abuse.  Because there are always warning signs.  I know that.  How many times have I heard people horrified in saying \\"I can't believe I didn't see that\\"  \\"How couldn't I have known?\\"  Or even worse, \\"I knew something wasn't right but I didn't want to believe they were capable of doing something like that.\\"<br />I'll try and summarize my friend's words at this point as best I can.<br />\\"Sexual predators are cons.  They almost always have a cover.  It's that cover which allows them access.  50 Shades of Grey is a con.  It now has access to millions of readers.  It is a story about abuse from beginning to end.  And it's not just the abuse of a man and a woman - it's the abuse of a man and a girl.<br />When you read it, look for the signs.  They are all there.<br />The female character has no sexual experience.  None.  She is given the age of 21, but that age is itself a cover.  Her true emotional age is much-much younger.  She has never even masturbated.  She has never even experienced an orgasm.  That alone is one of the greatest attractions to the pedophile.  That is the psychology of that kind of act.  You get off on taking purity.<br />But move from the fact the girl has no sexual experience whatsoever.  Now pay attention to her narrative dialogue.  Really listen to how she talks.  Again, she's not talking like a young woman, she'stalking like a girl.  She talks about cartwheels, and skipping, over and over again it is the language and the imagery of a girl.<br />After that this girl has her innocence taken from her.  The abuser, the older man, makes her think its her choice.  Again, you and I both know that is one of the primary tools of the pedophile.  They create an environment where the child feels it's their idea.  It's what they want. But what happens after that innocence is taken away?  Then the abuser becomes more openly abusive. Controlling.  In this story he tells the little girl how to speak.  What to wear.  What to eat.  He is Daddy and she is daughter.  When you read it read it like a mother who is also a woman who is experienced with the real life tragedy of abuse.<br />And there is many more themes about that abuse in this book.  There is spanking and the use of Baby oil.  Why baby oil?  Think about it.  The girl wears pigtails.  She complains that he is treating her like a child.  He says she acts like a child.  There is even a scene where the abuser creates a situation to take her innocence from her again.  He rips out her tampon and engages in forceful sex yet again.  Her hymen is ripped, and the bloody remnants of it are again symbolized in an act of pedophile rape.\\"<br />She went on to say there are women now defending the book, and she understands that, but it concerns her.  A great deal, because she is absolutely convinced the book is purposely advocating the raping of a child and attempting to normalize that atrocity.<br />So, I left that conversation thinking maybe my friend was exaggerating.  I had a hard time believing something so popular could actually have such a sinister and revolting theme, and while I respected her expertise and experience, thought this time she had to be seeing something that just wasn't there.<br />I got the book, I sat down, and I read it.<br />The first thing that struck me was how poor the writing was.  It wasn't just bad.  It was horrible.  But horrible writing is no crime, (thank goodness or I would have been put away a long time ago) and it doesn't make the content of the story evil.  But in my reading of it, just like my friend said, the theme of child abuse, of pedophilia, was right there in plain sight.  I remember being told a long time ago that sometimes the best way to hide something is in plain sight.  That is what 50 Shades of Grey is really doing.<br />The main character had no sexual experience.  None.  She was an innocent.  She was a kid who had just had her first drink of alcohol.  No way that was an accident by the author.  That author had to have purposely made her, despite her given age of 21, by any other measure, a little girl.  At that point, it struck me as odd.  In my business, we call that a warning signal. A sign we may have a problem.<br />From there, just like my friend had warned, it got worse.  Much worse.  And she was right, her telling me about it did not have the impact of me reading it myself with eyes open.  She had given me the signs to look for, and as I turned the pages, those signs confirmed it over and over again.<br />The narration, which is the voice of the girl talking to the reader, was the voice of a little girl.  It's unmistakable.  There is very little emotional maturity and absolutely no sexual maturity.  She is seduced by this man in the very same way a pedophile seduces a child.  The male character is Gerry Sandusky.  He makes a show of his money, his power, the things he can buy for her, but while this is going on, we are reading the thoughts of a child.  We are reading the seduction of a little girl by a pedophile.  She is almost completely powerless.  She is naïve even for a teenager, and certainly much much more naïve than a college student.  She is incapable of even making the most simple of every day decisions and must be told what to do by her abuser, who in turn though spends a lot of time and effort convincing this child this is really whatshe wants.  I've seen this before.  Too often.  Too many times.  And it always leaves me sickened.<br />We are reading child pornography.  Remove the false age of the girl, which has no basis in reality, and what we are actually reading is the abuse of a little girl.<br />The main character is described in pigtails, given words like \\"Holy Cow\\"  \\"down there\\", \\"jeez\\"  \\"double crap\\" she can't operate a computer (but is supposedly a college graduate), describes skipping and doing cartwheels, repeatedly says she is made to feel like a child, has her imaginary friend (inner goddess) feels shame, is spanked and slathered in BABY OIL, told what to say, what to eat, what to do, until finally and sadly so predictably, is physically beaten.  (But she returns to him soon after, which is again, a very common theme of abuse, including pedophilia)<br />And beyond all of this evidence there is the fact that the male character is himself a product of sexual abuse at the hands of a pedophile.  The girl whose thoughts we listen in on as she is being abused, recognizes this aspect of the male abuser, but apparently, is too naïve or unwilling to realize she has continued this cycle of abuse herself. (Which again reinforces the idea that she is actually herself just a child)  There is no way the author did this by accident.  She puts out the theme of pedophilia openly, therefore hiding it in plain sight.<br />People who have had to deal with the real world of sexual abuse of children will understand this perhaps more easily than others.  How the pedophile is so often themselves victims of earlier abuse.  They enter society, they become fathers or mothers, but so often they too become abusive.  They seek out dominance, control, and the taking of innocence just as it was taken from them.  Those who were once abused, become the abuser.  It is the sad sick and tragic cycle of pedophilia.<br />With 50 Shades of Grey this abnormal condition is trying to be normalized.  Thanks to the insightof my friend, and my own experience,  I know it for what it truly is - a story of the sexual abuse of child, wrapped in the cliché cover story of a mysterious and troubled wealthy man.  That is another thing my clinical psychologist friend pointed out later.  Take away the aspect of money, and the character of the abuser becomes much less attractive and therefore it would have been much more difficult to pull of the deception.  Are women actually that shallow?  Yes, we can be.<br />But women, the vast majority of us, are not people who knowingly condone the sexual abuse of children.  We do not condone in any way, the horror that is pedophilia.<br />Sadly though, that is exactly what is happening with the popularity of 50 Shades of Grey.  It's a pedophilia con.<br />It is one of the most horrible and sickening acts against the most powerless of our society, hiding in plain sight.<br />Maybe my friend put it best when we talked all of this over.  50 Shades of Grey didn't excite her.  She didn't find it interesting, sexy, or romantic.<br />50 Shades of Grey made her weep.  It made her sick.  It made her think of the abuses of all of those kids by a demented, warped monster like Jerry Sandusky, who, just like the pedophilia of 50 Shades of Grey, was hiding in plain sight.\\"
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I must say I really enjoyed this box set and how it was configured. Although the discs are stacked on one ane another, none of them had scratches or can actually get scratches. Unless ur careless. i watched the whole series and didnt have to go thru 11 boxes to watch them. The handy episode sheet came in handy too. I highly recommend this product to all u Bundy fans.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was just plain entertaining.  I've watched it several times and will probably watch many more times.<br />Great characters, story line cute.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game.  :-)  Very fun and very addicting.  I just love it. I have no problems with it at all. There are a few pop up ads, but they are easily and quickly dismissable. Time vampire.  It 's a free app.  No complaints here.
B0046ECFRM|2.0|Well written sweet story (at least I thought so at the start). Superb prose. Exceptional dialogue and character creation--the characters' sense of humour was so witty and natual. But the stakes weren't very high ... what WERE Anna's stakes?<br /><br />Anna is an example of a \\"Spunky Kid\\" personality type done perfectly and loveably (to start with). In the beginning I smiled while reading her thoughts and conversations, but she wasn't striving for anything. I didn't like not knowing her goal. It had to be something other than getting the guy at school, right? I mean, she liked the guy back home. At least there was no insta love here.<br /><br />I wrote the following periodically whilst reading the book. It contains ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />20% Nothing the author has told in narrative so far comes across as forced or fake--the writer's invisible. Such a rare talent! But the main conflict seems already to be miscommunication on the hero's side, which I can only put up with for a couple chapters before needing something fresh. The supposed conflict of Meredith also liking St. Clair (hero) seems to ALSO be one that could be cleared up with a quick, honest chat (my most hated form of conflict to read, but the easiest to plot).<br /><br />Even so, I'm thinking, \\"I am going to rate this 5 stars. Wow, I finally found a five star book!\\" I love all the interactions, especially the ones between the hero and heroine. Their personalities mesh so naturally. BUT I'm confused as to why St. Clair is leading Anna on when he has a girlfriend. I'm trusting this is going somewhere plausible.<br /><br />30% Plot has been dragging. Miscommunication still in use, annoying me. I REALLY need something to happen--a twist or an event that sets something different in motion. A different conflict please!<br /><br />Okay, a character just got some disturbing news, but it doesn't change the plot or give Anna a strong desire for something, even if it IS a guy.<br /><br />45% I'm DREADING that the kiss described in the title will only come nearing the end. That MOST of the plot is going to be this \\"when will they kiss/get together?\\" wrung out to the bitter end. Which--I'm sorry to say--is encouraging me to start skimming. I need more from the story than witty and fun conversations between friends, and outings with a guy she thinks she might like, while they both hide their true feelings.<br /><br />50% I'm lecturing myself to keep reading. I don't care how it'll end--I can speculate that well enough, and thinking I'm only half way to the ending is ... Well, reading the two MCs hold back their feelings in every. single. scene. together is torturous enough up to this point. And not the good kind of torture. I'm at the \\"enough already!\\" stage. WHY IS HE STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND WHEN HE'S SO TURNED ON AND JEALOUS AROUND ANNA? Is he a weak coward?<br /><br />70% It's not going anywhere but circles, and I'm so disheartened because it had started so great and the writing is good.<br /><br />75% This author does excellent arguments between the love interests. So real! I felt every word from both of them. He FINALLY made me understand why he'd stayed with his girlfriend while crushing hard on Anna (still wrong), but I can understand why Anna was still hurt by it. They needed this. NOW they can move on and forward. At bloody last! Now he can break up with Ellie, the poor thing. I'd hate to be her with him as a BF. BRILLIANTLY done scene!<br /><br />77% The opposite of brilliant. I want to screaaaaaaaaaam with frustration. Nothing. Has. Changed.<br /><br />79% Seriously? I can see the author conveniently throwing things between these two. Not in an \\"oh, no,\\" way (caring), but more like, \\"someone slap them!\\".

This time they just HAD to talk instead. Why? I have no freaking clue! They act like a couple and flirt constantly but won't kiss, even though they want to. Obviously it's because that's the ONLY plot device the author knows to keep readers reading.<br /><br />84% NO! One word: CONTRIVED! The author is a good writer, but a terrible storyteller/plotter. THAT is the new problem? Cliche much? So weak and annoying. Also, the kiss has been dangled and teased for so long, and my feelings have lessoned so much for Anna and him (HE'S a tease), that I felt nothing when they finally kissed. I also thought the kiss would have been written well--the book's title has the word KISS in it--but it was very...basic. Bland, even. Okay, maybe I've read too many good kissing scenes in fanfiction, but shouldn't \\"real\\" authors write them better?<br /><br />87% I think I hate Anna. I hate people who are hot, cold, hot, cold. The TEMPER on the girl! Her fun personality has deteriorated into a melodramatic, emo bitch! I would not want her as a friend. Man, and her double standards.  And I can't believe the plot has turned into \\"the alpha bitches are against the heroine.\\" I don't care if she is upset.<br /><br />90% Sigh. Fist-fight over heroine.

Wasn't sure what size to expect when I ordered it, I didn't read the fine print, but this is just the right size for a little one that can start to hold things.  Has the noisy tissue inside the wings, an attached rattle, can be attached to a crib, car seat, etc.  Very nice colors and seems to be me made of high quality material.  I bought this for my not yet born baby girl, it was too cute to pass up....this being the year of the dragon.  She won't get to play with it for some time, but having had other kids, I can safely bet this will be a favorite.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|This is only the 3rd album I have heard from The Man Dylan! It's been about a month since that first day I pushed pay on HIS forever favorite album of mine- \\" Bringing it all Back HOme\\"!!! That will forever be my favorite album of his because it was the first! 2nd was \\"Shot of Love\\" and I absolutely love it! 3rd that I have heard is \\"Tempest\\" !!!! I am really trying to pace myself with his music. It's such a deep well. It's like trying to take a drink of a fire hydrant!!!!!!<br /><br />I think my husband is a little freaked out by my new found love of BOB the DYLAN! I can't help it!  I love his sense of Humor, sarcasm and \\"cheeky\\" tone! It's fantastic. If you are down--Bob will bring you up.....but there is so much more to this MAN---So many people wonder how Bob Dylan COULD be so cool and collective but Bold. It's God iN HIM. Religion never changed Bob Dylan but Bob Dylan changed Religion and the way the world viewed it. He has never hidden his true feelings and relationship with Jesus Christ and even if you are not a believer you can't help but recognize that SOMETHING about HIM is \\"different\\" ........in the BEST of ways.....It has caused all of us that Love him to go on our own journey to find our purpose and TRUE peace. His writing and structure of every song is so genuinely honest that you begin to see how truly \\" un honest \\" other musician's mostly are. He is NOT afraid to be vulnerable before ALL.

0446547646|4.0|If you ever had a first love that got away, this is the book. It was a real page turner. It brought out a range of emotions, including tears. I really enjoyed this book. I read reviews where people said it was predictable. Maybe so at times, but I say it is a true romantic story. He wrote it with other characters involved in the story, and left us to fill in the details of their lovemaking. He tells a story, not just focusing on jumping in and out of bed. I found this very refreshing. I've read 2 more books by him since this read. I've found an author who actually tells a story.<br /><br />At first I thought I knew how the ending would be, but boy was I wrong. A funeral brings two high school lovers back together, but only for a short time. An old man's last wishes, a bar fight, car accident, and a one in a million chance of getting a transplant will keep you reading this book untill the very end.<br /><br />I'm not a big romance novel fan, but I tend to find myself enjoying Nicholas Sparks books anyway. I love how his stories are really well developed and thought-provoking, rather than just revolving around the physical aspects of love as many other romance novels do. \\"The Best of Me\\" had to be one of Nicholas Sparks' best novels yet. Yes, the basic theme is one that's been done over and over again - two high school sweethearts having to let go because real life interferes, and then running into each other again years later. But this story is so much more than that. You find yourself really sympathizing with the characters and understanding how difficult their situations are. Nicholas Sparks captures and holds your attention until the very end in this book, and this story is one that I'm sure will stick with me for a long time.<br /><br />The Best of Me follows the struggles of Amanda as she must decide between her imperfect family and her first love, Dawson. Her decision is heart-wrenching, and the events that ensue will inevitably bring tears to your eyes. Amanda discovers what really matters in life, and Dawson is able to truly give the best of himself to Amanda in a shocking manner.<br /><br />In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, The Best of Me is simultaneously heart-warming, melancholy, and suspenseful. How Dawson gives life to Amanda is sure to change your view on what is important to you.discovers what really matters in life, and Dawson is able to truly give the best of himself to Amanda in a shocking manner.<br /><br />In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, The Best of Me is simultaneously heart-warming, melancholy, and suspenseful.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|I really shouldn't like this flick.  Near gratuitous violence and a playoff from hell.  Still the violence is shielded in Hitchcockian manner and the premise tantalizing- that and great acting. Would we watch a literal death playoff on world TV if we could?  More to the point would we watch an American Idol - Ultimate Fighting amalgam if we could?  Sadly, I think we already know that answer.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Book three of the trilogy is much the same as the first two. Grey is still as overprotective and suffocating as ever, and Ana can, at times, be quite annoying. However, there are moments (and I am not talking about the sex scenes) that were fun to read. If you read and enjoyed the first one, go ahead and read the second. Same thing with the third. All in all, this is a \\"popcorn\\" book, one that helps you easily pass the time without any deep brain stimulation.
B008ER9QLK|4.0|It's interesting that the first 11 reviews gave this either 5 stars or 1 star. I was going to side with the 5 star people. I saw this in the flesh at the Met and I thought it was fantastic. My only concern was, would you get the same scope of the production on a screen rather than in person. I bought the blu ray on day one, and then had my first misgivings.<br /><br />I saw Das Rheingold twice: once in its first run in 2011, and again in the full cycle in 2012. The two things I found distracting in 2011 were both fixed by the time the full cycle was staged: the excessive creaks of the machine, and the Gods making their entrances by sliding down the set in a most un-Godlike manner. But on picking up this set I see that Das Rheingold is an early recording, 2010 even, and I skipped through to see that, yes, the Gods come sliding in!<br /><br />(From other reviews I understand that early versions of the funeral pyre in Gotterdammerung were a bit feeble, but were much better in the full cycle. I haven't got that far in this set yet...)<br /><br />So why not 1 star? For one thing, I thought this was a fantastic experience, musically and visually. I thought the set and its use were spectacular. Perhaps the critics (and I've only really seen Anthony Tomassini of the NY Times and Alex Ross of the New Yorker) and some of the other reviewers here have seen so many Rings that they need something to shock them rather than something to revel in? For me, this was only my second Ring (the first, which I saw on DVD only, was the Kupfer/Billy version). Both were fairly traditional, but I would rate this higher on most counts. (Graham Clark as Mime gets an extra point in the Kupfer/Billy version). For me, I find there is more than enough material for reflection in the music and words without needing some clever staging. There may come a time when I'm ready for Wild West, Corporate or Hydroelectric Rings, but I'm not there yet. In the meantime I will bask in this, and maybe nip to thekitchen for a moment just before anyone is due to slide in.<br /><br />Postscript: I just wanted to add that Jay Hunter Morris is the best Siegfried I've seen! Not only can he sing the part, but he is totally believable to watch as well. All other Siegfrieds I've seen look like middle-aged men trying to look like headstrong teenagers.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|I've been looking forward to seeing 'Love Never Dies' for years. I finally got the chance to see it because of this DVD. I was not very amused with this Australian production. The Phantom's (Ben Lewis) voice is sometimes weaker than preferred, and Christine's (Anna O'Byrne) voice is often shriekingly annoying. However, the young son Gustave's (Jack Lyall) voice is surprisingly beautiful and it stands out. I also didn't find the sets that impressive. After watching it, I felt the songs were overall weak - far below the bar set by the original 'The Phantom of the Opera'. The great big song at the end, 'Love Never Dies', sounded like it should be a happy ballad, but O'Byrne just made me feel sad. Overall, I was quite disappointed. Later, I scoured the internet for other versions of the songs. I discovered that Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess starred in the very first showings of the musical in London in 2010. There are a few bits from that performance available on YouTube. The most of a song you can find is the opening song by the Phantom, \\"'Til I Hear You Sing\\", and it is so much more moving when sung by Karimloo than when sung by Lewis.<br /><br />As for the story, this too is a little weak. At the end of POTO, Christine goes with Raoul instead of the Phantom, and the Phantom professes his love for Christine. In POTO, Raoul comes off as a real prince-charming-type. In 'Love Never Dies', which takes place ten years later, Raoul has become a gambling drunk. He's put his family in debt and apparently makes demands on Christine to sing wherever he chooses. She has become a world-famous singer, and he knows he can milk it. In short, Raoul has become the villain. They travel to Coney Island after they receive an invitation to sing at Phantasma, a Coney Island amusement park. They have no idea the Phantom is behind the invite. This soon changes, and the story becomes if Christine will choose Raoul or the Phantom. I think the story would have been much better if new characters were introduced. The only new character is the young boy, Gustave. Other than that, the cast is the Phantom, Christine, Raoul, Meg Giry, and Madame Giry. There are a few silly cirus-types who have a few lines, but they don't come into the plot. The story just really needed to be more fleshed-out. It felt very basic.

B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger Games is one of the greatest movies of all times; sure, it can be seen as action oriented and thrilling but that would be missing the bigger picture. Like Avatar Hunger Games goes deeper into how humans can be deprived of all humanity by decadence. One might enjoy the brilliance of the settings e.g. the capitol city, the costumes, and the special effects, however, without also allowing the movie to touch the viewer on a personal level, without making them think about the fight for survival and empathy the point would be missed. Watching the movie without thinking of how it reflects human history in so many ways would be disrespectful.

B005LAII0I|3.0|This movie takes a new spin on the tale of Snow White and is a sweet little flick. It boasts a pleasant fairy tale feel from start to finish, and is garnished with wonderful scenery and costume design that add well to maintaing the atmosphere. Lily Collins is impressively perfect in the main role, shining as a sweet and endearing title character and looking just plain adorable. Julia Roberts as the evil queen does an okay job, but isn't really given much to do other than look irritated for most of the film. The dwarfs were fun and provided little quips that gave them a little more edge than what we've seen in previous adaptations. While I enjoyed it enough (mostly because I was enchanted by Lily Collins), it is also a little forgettable because the story just doesn't quite get where it needs to go and everything feels a bit vague and distant. Still, I would watch it again if it popped up on TV, and I especially think younger age groups will be drawn to this movie. It's worth a watch; just don't expect it to blow your mind.

0525953728|3.0|The book is a 5 star the 3 stars is because of Amazon read below.<br /><br />First about the book. I am sick and tired of the cry babies who say he did wrong by telling all. If he did wrong and the Defense Department wants to charge him they better have Obama right beside him!! Obama was the first one to tell all so what is differance between him and Obama? Does the President get a free get out of jail because he is the president and he can do what ever he wants or do they want to charge him because his and Obama's stories are not the same? I spent 24 years in the military and had to sign the same letter about anything I did. But I feel that if the president and everyone else is running around talking about it then it is no longer a secret and it is fair game.<br /><br />Here is why I give the book 3 Stars:<br /><br />This is the third time in the last two weeks I have had problems with an Amazon order. First one was this book I pre-ordered the book and the Amazon website said I would get the book on the day it released (4 Sept) next day I get an email from Amazon saying the book wouldn't be released till the 6th. I Check on Amazon on the 4th and there are over 50 reviews from people who have got the book and are reading it!! When I did get the book on the 6th it was put loose in a box with several other items and one is a heavy metal item that was packed on top of the book. The book dust jack was damaged due to the metal piece rubbing on it during shipping, so I had to send it back and get an exchange. The exchange was not much better shape than the other book. It was attached to a piece of cardboard that had the corners cut off and was wrapped in shrinkwrap. The corners of the book were damaged due to the shrinking of the shrinkwrap on the corners. The book was to be a birthday gift for my father, so not to have to go through the trouble of printing a return label then having to tape the box up plus using my gas to drive across town to drop it of for return shipping I kept the exchange and went and bought dad a new one at Barns and Noble.<br /><br />Yesterday I got another item from Amazon a coal hod (bucket) and shovel the items were not packed right again, the shipping box was too tall and was not long or wide enough for the item with only one piece of paper stuck on top of the bucket to protect it. It arrive with the finished of the bucket having big chips and scratches all over the outside and inside and the dust was so deep on the inside you could write your name, which I did and am returning it today.<br /><br />If Amazon keeps sending damaged items I will not be doing business with them any more!!! I am tired of having a problem and calling to talk to someone and getting a call center in India where the people can barely speak english and have no idea what you are trying to tell them. You have to explain yourself four or five times and they still do not get it right or screw it up on the return. You do a exchange and then get a hold of Amazon via email or phone and the person in India who handles the support center sets up another retrurn then you have to call and have them cancel the second one or you will be chared for the return also. Wating to see how this latest return gets screw up because I did an exchange and then sent ann email about the poor packing and the person in India set up another return.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was surprisingly pleased with Office Pro (OP). It delivered on what it said it could do. I am able to read, edit and save my MS Word, Excel and Powerpoint files. It is easy to operate, very intuitive user interface.  I recommend the application to anyone who needs to modify their MS Documents. Oh by the way, the PDF support is excellent.

B004WPYNY8|3.0|This is not where I would point people as a starting place for the usually brilliant Symphony X.<br /><br />They have greatly abandoned(starting loosely on the previous album, Paradise Lost) those elements which had made them unbeatable as a progressive metal band; most notably, melody.  Just still barely alive are those proggier touches; but I fear that they have(or possibly because of their new record label)all but dropped the superlative style of the past to cater to the bombastic modern metal crowd of youth and shorter attention spans.
B001NI24OI|5.0|A great movie that gets to the heart of what high school football is about. It stirs the heart and gets you involved with its characters.
B008QDCZ3S|2.0|... it's just a copy of the old (and very weird) Sony SACD surround mix. The drums are spread out in stereo; everything else is coming out of the center channel; I didn't notice anything from the rear, and there are absolutely no low frequencies in the mix at all. They must have misunderstood bass-management when they produced this early 5.1 master (the same bass problem exists on the old Sony SACD of \\"Kind Of Blue\\"). I have to repeat - there are NO low frequencies anywhere in the mix. The acoustic bass, in the center channel, sounds like a ukelele with thick strings.<br /><br />To add to the agony, the piano is in mono in the center channel along with the tinny bass.<br /><br />For clarity, let me say that I have about 300 SACDs and (with a few exceptions) they all sound gorgeous in surround. I also know how to set up both my SACD player and my receiver to decode these discs correctly.<br /><br />To their credit, the company does mention the origin of the multichannel layer on their website way down at the bottom of the lengthy description (unfortunately, I neglected to read it). They say they included the old Sony surround mix for historical purposes. They should have let it die a lonely death instead of extending its agony with life support via rerelease.<br /><br />The stereo mix sounds fine, and if that's what you're buying this for (as many of you are), you'll be pleased, hence the generous 2 stars. But if you're buying it for the multichannel experience (which is why I buy SACDs), you'll be really, really ticked off and your wallet will be thinner.<br /><br />My god, I wish I could have gotten my money back....
B008XG1X18|3.0|This app worked fine on my kindle fire at first, but it wasn't long before issues started - long delays in loading,  unexpected closings, pins that won't load properly,  and so on. So while I love the Pinterest website,  the app...not so much.
B005LAIGLE|3.0|Chris Farraday (Mark Walhberg) thought he'd left his smuggling days behind him, but when his kid brother-in-law screws up a smuggling gig for a drug dealer (Giovanni Ribisi), Chris realizes he has to head back into the world he knows so well to save his wife's (Kate Beckinsale) drowning brother, but it's not all as simple as it seems.<br /><br />`Contraband' doesn't disappoint while it lasts, but it's also forgettable after the credits roll and probably serves better as a rental for a night-in. Director Baltasar Kormakur knows how to keep up the tension throughout the film and throwing twist after unexpected twist at us while getting Chris and his crew deeper under water until, mid-way through, they're so in the crap you'll wonder how the heck they'll get themselves out - which felt a lot more like out of bad guy slip-ups and luck by the way -  right down to the double-crossings and shock discoveries. The action, while hardly `an action junkie's playground' (LA Times), is kept very grounded and real and is in keeping with the grittier edge of the film, and it works, I didn't find anything here that was over-the-top or ridiculous.<br /><br />I didn't watch commentary track but I did sit through `Reality Factor: The Stunts and Action of Contraband', basically a short documentary about how Kormakur wanted to keep the action and stunts real and a walk-through on shooting some of the action scenes in the movie, mildly interesting, but also pretty unremarkable stuff.
B007IX00ZC|5.0|Open the parcel right after I received it, and wasn't satisfied by carton cd-pack I saw.<br />1st song was known as the one from official website of the DSO - band. After that all album was too complicated for me! In fact (IMHO) this 3rd album is not the 3rd... it is Totally Different from all I could expect from Diablo Swing Orchestra. After 1st listening I thought that I mistaken with bought it. Re-listened \\"The Butcher's Ballroom\\" and second one - \\"Sing Along Songs For The Damned And Delirious\\" for few times during a week...<br />Two days ago took Pandora's Piñata and charged it to cd-drive-slot of my car sound system. It played for 3 cycles without rest.<br />Drive Guitar, Hard Drums, Annlouice Lögdlund Gorgeous Vocal, Cello, And \\"Aurora\\" track which are made as classical Opera of early 20 century style!<br />What I can tell in final - This 3rd album \\"Pandora's Piñata\\" is a giant leap from previous two albums of Diablo Swing Orchestra and I'm very disappointed that I couldn't attend their concert yet!<br />It's my favorite album for now! CD pack material has no sense... Song texts in the booklet - that has!<br /><br />Listen in high quality sound system only! & Loud volume!<br /><br />My thanks to<br />Diablo Swing Orchestra!
B0000033RY|4.0|I picked this one up just poking through a used shop over the labor day weekend along with some fine delta & chi-town blues to go. I remember having the 1st with \\"Parchman Farm\\" & Restrictions (their last with McCarty) back in the day. I may have traded these slabs of heavy rock boogie for other equally appealing slabs o wax but either way they got lent out & never retrived. I slid the disc in & smiled as the band tore through \\"Evil\\" by the Wolf. This tune just about sums it up. These guys were extreemly tight, muscular & over the top hard rocking boogie. As good as it got. Cactus stood up to anyone I can think of at the time. I am talking about stuff like ZEP, Beck-Ola, Cream & Detroit legends the MC5. Cactus sound was propelled by the hard hammering bass of Tim Bogert & the thunderous double bass attack of Carmine Appice (ex Vanilla Fudge). The frontal assault was carried out by ex Detroit Wheels gunslinger Jim McCarty & ex Amboy Dukes frontman Rusty Day, 2 mototr city rock veterans. The true underdog in all this metal madness is clearly McCarty. His guitar work is on par with his peers at home & across the pond. Day provides the screech & blues wailin' harp & easily bests his stint with the Dukes. The LP \\"Cactology\\" was mastered by Rhino & it does sound good & that coming from someone who had the vinyl (I wish I still had em!). This band was basically hard edged boogie blues, Rock & Roll & proto metal. Why didnt they go the miracle mile? While this band could literally lay waste their competition on stage, they were not what I would call song writting aces. That was not their forte although they did very good covers & wrote very decent if not derivitive originals. They did play the college circuit here in MA & I know someone who saw 'em & was just killed by them live. Alas, I was only in Jr High or so. If you are a fan of high octane blues rock that the late 60s early 70s had to offer pick this up or there is also a 2 cd set that is also an anthology but OOP. Or,find the vinyl of the 1st 3 lp's cause they dont make legends like Cactus anymore.

It's a shame bc the game looks pretty awesome, but in the end, is a complete waste of time, effort &amp; money. Don't even bother with this one until the dev knows how to fix it. Very disappointing.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Okay, so I am just starting this book after reading the 1st one (which is WAY BETTER than the movie). I am only just in the beginning but I have noticed that the author brings up things from the first book in this book, that we already know. We know how Katness got her name (from the first book) we know how mockingjays came about (from the frist book) so why repeat what we already know!? I don't think people are going to start on the 2nd book of a 3 book trilogy so no need to repeat what has already been said. And for the avid reader, you remember everything from the first book so again, no need to repeat it, but she does. I am hoping that it does not continue throughout the book.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|I guess I'm just jumping on the bandwagon and loving this book like everyone else has done, but it really is that simple.  Blake Crouche's 'Pines' is one of the best-crafted thrillers to appear in a long time.  He handles his suspense well and knows just what he has to do to keep the readers turning (or 'clicking' if they're reading on a Kindle, like me).  -- Plot-wise, all the novice needs to know is that a federal agent, Ethan Burke, has entered a small, bucolic Idaho town in search of two missing agents.  The town seems to conspire against him in the most innocent of ways.  Then, it's not so innocent.  Then, it just becomes thrilling and bizarre and the book itself becomes 'unputdownable.'  I tore through this book in two days and even had a dream (nightmare) about it last night ... and I finished the book weeks ago.  --  The very best thing Blake Crouch does in 'Pines' is not let the reader down.  Too often, readers are delighted at plot twists and turns in books, wondering how the author will wrap it all up, and then are let down by the ending.  Not so with Crouch.  The twists keep coming until all the solutions you thought you had fall by the wayside to hitchhike their way back to town.  What ends the book is a reveal that is both surprising and rewarding.  It seems a cliche to say a book is like 'a ride', but that's exactly what 'Pines' is, a ride.  A very satisfying one at that.  Now, I'm going to wait in line for the next ride Blake Crouch has to offer.
B008BM9L72|1.0|This book is so badly written that is astounds me it was published. The characters are shallow and unrealistic and have absolutely nothing of any interest to say.

B008L1PYQU|3.0|Before I could even read, I knew what the words \\"KISS - Destroyer\\" looked like. As a small child, I learned to recognize those words on the spine of the record, as it was my favorite album at the time. I would look through my father's 600-700 record collection when I woke up every morning, carefully scanning them all for those little words. By the time my dad woke up I would have the record out on the coffee table waiting to be played. I'm sure he was utterly sick of hearing the album every day from 1976 through about 1978.<br /><br />That being said, I have a deep love for the music contained therein, & I was excited to hear this newly remastered with bonus track version so I ordered it immediately. The record just showed up, & what do you know? The same 9 tracks as I'm used to hearing are the only tracks listed. I'm at work, so I don't have a turntable near to test it, but unless the back of the record is incorrect, then track 10 (Sweet Pain w_Original Guitar Solo) is conspicuously missing.<br /><br />I have heard the CD, so I know that it is included in that version. Not sure why the need to leave it out of the vinyl, especially when I see it listed on the Amazon description.<br /><br />As for the remaster itself, I can hear marginal improvements, but not the major overhaul I expected. Ezrin did a good job at separating the tracks a bit more than before, but unless you just need an excuse to pick up this version (ie: don't already own any version of the album) or you are just a big fan of alternate cover art (it is pretty sweet I must admit), then I'd skip this one, especially if you are buying the vinyl expecting a bonus track that isn't there.<br /><br />-----------------<br />EDIT:<br />Thanks 24 voltsdc for confirming that the track is in fact present (just not listed on the tracklist on the back of the cover itself).

0385344333|5.0|The action in this newest in the Jack Reacher series begins with a body discovered in what is apparently an abandoned pumping station in rural Nebraska, an eyewitness able to give only scant details of the two men he saw with the victim, and who drove away in a bright red car afterwards.  Very shortly thereafter, in addition to the local police, representatives of several governmental agencies designated by groups of letters such as CIA and FBI descend on the area.  An alert is quickly put in place on all highways along the area interstates for the two men.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is variously described here as ex-military, specifically a former major in the Criminal Investigation Division of the Military Police, now unemployed and essentially homeless, self-described, most pertinently here, as \\"just a guy, hitching rides.\\"  On the same mid-winter night, he has been standing at the side of an on-ramp for over an hour when he is given a ride in a car with two men and a woman inside, his ultimate destination being Virginia.  That destination and his present appearance, the main feature of which is a badly broken nose, are the aftermath of events at the end of the last book in the series; an imposing figure overall, the broken nose is probably the main reason why it took so long for him to be offered a ride.<br /><br />Initially the points of view alternate between Reacher and Julia Sorenson, the FBI Special Agent first called to the crime scene, a very capable 25-year Bureau veteran out of the Omaha field office.  Eventually their paths cross, and they work together to get to the bottom of what turns out to be anything but your average murder.<br /><br />The book is everything one can expect in a Lee Child/Jack Reacher novel, including terrific plotting and characterizations, and especially Reacher himself, who, when asked by one of the men in the car that picked him up, \\"You don't like to be pushed around, do you, Mr. Reacher?\\" responds \\"I don't know.  I've never been pushed around.  If it ever happens, you'll be the first to find out whether I like it or not.\\"  He demonstrates once again his vast knowledge of relatively arcane trivia, such as the population and area codes of almost any spot in the United States.  It's great to have him back, and the novel, one I swiftly devoured, is highly recommended.

B003D5FDEC|4.0|Great album as Joe is one of the best guitarists. You really have to have an appreciation for what he does and how he does it. That said, this is not for the faint of heart.

B000SEGUDE|4.0|I've put off reviewing this book for some months because after reading it, I needed some time to process what the heck I had just read.<br /><br />The book is brilliant! The author is so obviously talented and the way the story is woven is unlike anything I've ever read before (this is my first David Mitchell novel). I was extremely impressed with the versatility of the author - he writes in six completely distinct voices - and the worlds and plots he creates. I can only compare my reaction at the end of the book to the way I felt after watching the movie Memento. I had to go back through my memory, trying to piece things together, questioning my own recollections, trying to see the big picture. The book is a bit of a mind-bender, makes you think about the way the world is heading and the meaning of life. Profound and philosophical stuff.<br /><br />Having said that, the book is also difficult and tedious. Some voices (there are six) are easier to read than others. I had the most difficulty with Adam Ewing (voyager) and Zachry (tribesman) because of the language and length of those parts. There were many times I got bogged down by a scene and would have to set the book aside, take a break. I wondered if the author could have been more succinct in parts, or if there was any editing done to pare the plot down. Still, I persisted reading and in the end, I was rewarded with a rich, emotional tale (or set of tales).<br /><br />This is not a novel I would read again because of the length and intensity of the story. (With my kindle I feel that there is so much to read and so little time). However, I hope to see the movie and will definitely remember this reading experience as one which has made a huge impression on me.

I'm not a huge fan of audio or ebooks, mainly because I think it takes a lot more effort to learn and be interactive with your product. However, after listening to the CDs, I felt pretty good about them. Everything was clearly layed out, and the speaker didn't put me to sleep. Overall, the content was fantastic as well!

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I read some reviews before I decided to buy A Dance with Dragons. A lot of people commented that it wasn't George R.R. Martin's best, but I personally loved it. There are parts that include excessive traveling...but seriously so did Lord of the Rings and it was still amazing. A Dance with Dragons is definitely necessary for slowly building up to the climax, and knowing Martin, it certainly does take an entire book to do this. Trust me you will regret not reading A Dance with Dragons once The Winds of Winter comes out.

0790731894|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that this film is the best action-thriller I've ever seen! As a pre 9-11 film it really hits the mark as to what really could happen. Everything in the movie was believable. Indeed, the basic premise from the plot may have been studied by Bin Laden himself and simply modified, I'm sad to say. This is a film that was realistic even at the time as a smaller plane had been used as a suicide weapon on the White House in 1994.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />The plot centers around Dr. David Grant, a senior advisor to Army Intelligence and the Pentegon on terrorism (Yes, Terrorists Were Taken Very Seriously Pre 9-11) is asked to accompany Lt. Colonel Austin Travis on his mission to take back a 747 that has been hijacked by terrorists attempting to free Abu Jaffa from US custody. Using a highly modified F-117, the crack team of commandos manages to board the plane. Unfortunately something goes wrong with the umbilical link and the F-117 disentegrates, killing Lt. Travis and one of his men. The pilot manages to eject from the plane but whether he is rescued or not is not mentioned in the movie. Now aboard the plane the remaining commandos must make due with their situation. Cappy is seriously injured and the others are shaken up as well, but they perservere.<br /><br />The terrorist leader is Nagi Hassan. He plans to detonate a nerve toxin over at Dulles Airport that would make 9-11 (At The Time Five Years Away) look like a pop gun. \\"You can forget Washington; there's enough nerve agent here to wipe out half the eastern seaboard!\\" Grant (Russell) said with poignant shock.<br /><br />Washington releases Abu Jaffa from custody but Hassan continues towards his suicide mission and will not be disuaded by his mentor and superior. When F-14s intercept the 747, Hassan executes a US Senator to make his point clear. Fortunately by splicing into the tail lights the commandos are able to flash Morse code to the F-14 pilots and they are able to gainextra time. While this is going on, Cappy, the bomb disposal specialist, and engineer Dennis Cahill work on defusing the bomb.<br /><br />Grant, a former Naval Academy man improvises and goes up top to take out the sleeper man so that the bomb cannot be detonated remotely. With the help of a plucky flight attendant played by the beautiful Halle Berry, the two engage he whom they assume to be the sleeper. Unfortunately the \\"sleeper\\" is only an innocent diamond smuggler (About To Lose His Load). But Grant locks eyes on the true sleeper terrorist and manages to assault the individual. Conterminously the commandos drop down from the ceiling and shoot four terrorists. A Federal Air Marshall joins in the fray and manages to shoot and wound Nagi Hassan, thus saving Grant's life. Unfortunately the Marshall is seriously wounded by another terrorist.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Cahill and Cappy have managed to interdict the bomb device while the plane is retaken but Hassan slays the pilots which forces David Grant to take the contols of the plane. With help from Jean, the flight attendant, Grant manages to and bring the Boeing 747 down in a forced landing.<br /><br />With the disaster averted, and everyone licking their wounds, they all realize how lucky they were to dodge a major bullet. The movie ends with Grant driving off with Jean in an FBI car.<br /><br />I remember seeing this movie when it came out in the theaters at the time. I loved it then and I love it now. Indeed, I'm surprised by how much I'd forgotten from the movie in more than 15 years' time since I last saw it. Halle Berry was incredible! This is the role that put her on the map as far as American audiences. Russell, playing the intellectual of the group, who manages to hold everyone together when Lt. Travis is killed is exemplary. This movie is one of his best all time. Now let's get to Seagal, who surprised us all when his character was killed. I can honestly say I was shocked when I saw that Seagal died! I wasexpecting an Under Siege (1992 Version) situation! I assumed he would board the plane and slaughter all of the terrorists. And you know what? That's what would have happened had he and his entire crew boarded intact. But the brilliance of the script forces us to accept the situation of: \\"What if the main hero was killed in a mishap before actually encountering the bad guys?\\" That had never and has never been duplicated before and it worked so well. All through their preparation and planning in the back of our minds we wonder how Steven Seagal's character would have dealt with the situation. This movie is not a true action film, but more like a suspense-thriller. No matter, it succeeds on all counts. Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed. Although I don't own the Blu-ray, so I can't speak for the supposed cuts they have made on it. I can say that the movie I saw again on DVD last night appeared to be completely intact and unedited from what I originally saw in theatres in 1996. The movie holds its own well today mainly because of the events we find ourselves surrounded with and the realism of the world we live in and, of course, because of the horrible events of September 11, 2001. I'm proud to be the 91st person to review this movie.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B003ZJJFKE|3.0|Joe is Joe and always good, the band is tight and plays well together. The addition of the keyboard usually provides a lighter sound and there are portions of overuse. But this is an enjoyable CD for Joe fans, the ususal stuff. Still awaiting a really breakout screamer from Joe to go the next level.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|*1)There is an area of land that was once called North America.  That area now consists of the CAPITOL ruling area, PANEM, with 12 outlying Districts.  The Districts are kept segregated, given numbers, not names, and can't talk to each other - no unity for ease of hard-line control. *2)To further control and prove subservience Each District is forced to provide One Girl, and One Boy, ages 12 - 18, to fight each other until death, with one to survive, in the televised Annual Hunger Games.  The persons are selected by lottery and are called TRIBUTES. The Games are \\"Hunger\\", as the winning Tribute's District will receive extra food rations for one year. *3)KATNISS is a 16 year old girl that lives in the 12th District - the poorest, which was previously known as Appalachia.  Her father was a coal miner and Game Hunter and taught her to Bow Hunt before he was killed in an explosion. She has been the provider for her widowed mother and young sister since the age of 12.  *4)At the District 12 Annual Festival for Tribute selection Lottery, Kitniss' 12 year old sister, PRIM, is drawn to represent them as the Female Tribute, and a 16 year old Male, Peta, is drawn.  KATNISS pulls PRIM aside and shouts \\"I will go in her place\\".  The Committee accepts KATNISS as their Female Tribute, and immediately throughout the Capitol and Districts KATNISS becomes a Heroine & Celebrity.  *5)Tributes from all Districts are transported by Train to Capitol for rules, weapons, & fitness training before the Games.  In transit KATNISS realizes she knows PETA.  He had given her family burnt bread when she was 12 - it kept them from starving.  She also remembers they will be adversaries and will have to kill each other.  She remembers her strengths - she is stringy lean, strong, and knows how to be a predator. She must survive for her family.  *6)This is just the start of this GREAT story, and it has many more exciting subtleties, characters, and events, and is Highly Recommend by BANDITO.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I honestly had skipped over this book so many times because of the reviews. So many were saying the book glorified abuse and that was not something I cared to read about. But then one of my friends on Goodreads said to give it a chance. So I downloaded a sample read. I still wasn't completely convinced after reading the sample but figured I started it so I might as well as finish it.<br /><br />I am glad I did!<br /><br />This book was good. I honestly am confused by the reviewers that were so against it. I do not think it glorifies abuse as Travis never once hits Abby. Sure he has a short fuse but that angry is directed at others. And no he is not going to be winning any boyfriend of the year awards. But it is the books that have the bad boys in them that usually draw us in anyway.<br /><br />So if you like me and on the fence because of reviews you have read I say give this book a chance. It truly will surprise you.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love my kindle fire, and I love pinterest, but this app needs work. Literally every other time I open this app it has to force close. When it works, it works great though.
B00932HEX2|2.0|The whole premise of this series is nearly beyond imagination.<br /><br />A US marine that helps kill one of his buddies in Iraq?  Seriously, between the implausible story and Danes as a CIA agent, the whole thing is unbelievable.<br /><br />Probably nobody is watching.
B008LZHA3G|3.0|I enjoy the evolution of Dylan's work. At this point his role in my life is more religion than preference. With that said, I wavered between two and three stars for Tempest. Lyrically, it's pretty solid. Musically - ah, that's a different tale. While Dylan has always used his blues and folk influences to great effect, here they dominate to the detriment of the whole. (Even worse, it's a Chicago Blues obsession and I'm a Delta fan.) On a 3 - 4 minute side the repetitive beats can work. Tempest finds Dylan is stretching them out 7 + minutes with little variation. As a result Tempest quickly becomes a monotonous slog where the lyrics are lost to the numbing effect of the backing track. (Is there such a thing as Steampunk House Music? Dylan may have just invented it.) At it's heart, Tempest is tedious. It's a shame. I'd like to hear the vocal lifted onto a fresher base, something more interesting for the listener. After failing to love Tempest on the headphones or with the speakers I tried Tempest out in the car and ended up turning it off. Between the repetitive beats and the demanding track length I can tell Tempest is getting shelved next to David Bowie's Tin Machine albums. I take those out once every few years just to see if I appreciate them yet. So far the answer has always been no. Plenty of the faithful disagree with me. So too will it be for The Tempest.
0300169787|5.0|I have to say that ts is SURELY t best thing Ive ver bought! Its so amazing, beautiful and the deliever was fast. I was really excited when I had it on my hands! And, well, the pictures are jus SHOCKING. I mean, I just LOVEd IT.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|I'm a big fan of Dead Can Dance, but I know their albums can be kind of hit or miss depending on what you like best about their music.  This album is a lot less gimmicky than some of their other work, and just a straightforward, beautiful work of art.  The lyrics are less pretentious than they have been in the past, and while the album has a definite unifying feel to it, the songs are distinctive and stand out from one another.  It's somewhat dark, but not brooding.  It sets an atmosphere, but it's not just background music.  Honestly, I'd consider it one of their best albums.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really like the book, it was interesting reading.  If you like 50 shades of Gray you will like this book too (without the Trilogy).
0385344333|4.0|Enjoyed reading Lee Child's new Jack Reacher novel, A Wanted Man, and I'm reminded of David Baldacci's thriller Zero Day, which featured a protagonist who was clearly a Jack Reacher clone named John Puller. Can't help but notice there's a not-too-bright deputy in A Wanted Man named Puller. I'm sure it's just a coincidence....
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Some commentators have already pointed out that `The Tempest' was the final play Shakespeare wrote before his demise, and that by choosing the title `Tempest' for this album - his 35th in a 50-year recording career - His Bobness might, at age 71, be sending a discrete message to his global audience that he is planning to hang up his guitar for the last time.<br /><br />More likely, the album's title holds no such cryptic meaning and Bob has no imminent retirement plans. `Tempest' employs a patchwork of musical styles broadly continuing the groove which characterize Dylan's previous four albums from `Time out of Mind' to `Together through Life' - his 21st century work and some of his very best, sometimes referred to as his \\"social security renaissance\\". The chosen musical forms often hark back to pre-rock-and-roll, jazz and rockabilly rhythms endowing them with a timeless folk-quality as though they might have been created anytime in the past 80 years and are difficult to date - kicking off with `Duquesne Whistle' on which Bob manages to sound like Louis Armstrong singing a number in the 1930s, over a thumping double-bass dominated rhythm.<br /><br />Whilst lacking the deep personal poignancy found in such abundance on `Time out of Mind', `Tempest' is a dark album with serious themes. Bob continues on top form lyrically, and his singing voice is, if anything, slightly improved and on more melodic form than on recent recordings. His singing on `Scarlet Town' is particularly melodic as he croons out dark and menacing lyrics in a subdued minor-key.<br /><br />The title track is a 14-minute epic of narrative story-telling with a dark, brooding theme musing on the Titanic shipwreck in 1912. Dylan delivers a 45-verse centenary tribute to those 1,500 lost lives over a subdued accordion and fiddle in a traditional sea-shanty style. It's laconic and poetic, and seeps into your soul only on the third or fourth listening.<br /><br />The backing band (six musicians are credited but only five feature in the photo with Bob) are perfect for Dylan's timeless 21st century style, and ensure that while you listen to the lyrics, your feet will often be tappin' and your hips a-twistin'.<br /><br />The package of the basic release is a pretty thin offering, with simple jewel case and single four-page insert with no song lyrics, the dominant colours black and deep maroon with red lettering; perfect packaging for future `deluxe' upgrades?<br /><br />Let's hope this is not Bob's swan song, but there's life in the old dog yet. As he sings on `Early Roman Kings':<br /><br />\\"I ain't dead yet<br />My bell still rings;<br />I keep my fingers crossed<br />Like the early Roman kings\\"<br /><br />We keep our fingers crossed for you, Bob. Long may ye survive and thrive.but only five feature in the photo with Bob) are perfect for Dylan's timeless 21st century style, and ensure that while you listen to the lyrics, your feet will often be tappin' and your hips a-twistin'.<br /><br />The package of the basic release is a pretty thin offering, with simple jewel case and single four-page insert with no song lyrics, the dominant colours black and deep maroon with red lettering; perfect packaging for future `deluxe' upgrades?<br /><br />Let's hope this is not Bob's swan song, but there's life in the old dog yet.

B000056HE9|5.0|This movie is just a sweet, feel-good movie.  Loretta Young has such expressive eyes you can feel her sadness and love and joy just by looking at them.  I do enjoy the Preacher's Wife which is an updated version, but this picture of a simpler time is really wonderful.  The trailer is a must watch, so funny.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is not for someone who wants to play for long periods of time or constantly. It is more of a time killer in short increments. I am addicted after only a couple days but the time limits keep me from overplaying. Overall I enjoy the game a lot. It helps to go online and read a full synopsis of the game so that you make less mistakes in the beginning because without that info it can get a little frustrating figuring out the rules in your own.
B001CEE1WG|4.0|I thought the movie was a 6 out of 10 for two reasons:  A little too lengthy with some lulls and the Joker was not as he was in the comic.  White makeup in this one instead of his face being bleached by acid?  The interpretations by Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson were far better than Ledger's.<br /><br />Good cinematography and an excellent soundtrack with some serious emphasis on LFE made this an easy add for the home theater.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like it a lot! despite that it crashes a lot i still enjoy the app. i can take my new addiction with me where ever  i go
B008VBYN80|4.0|its a very fun game just needs more ways of getting energy but all and all its a very good game I like it
0307341550|5.0|If you want an easy read and a great story then this is the book. Gillian Flynn's Sharp Objects was intense, suspensful and heartbreaking all at the same time. Read it in one day while vacationing! This is a book you will pass on!
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I ordered the deluxe version on September 6 from Santiago, Chile, and when I got back home on September 11, I found that the parcel had already been delivered. Thanks for that, Amazon!<br />It's been less than 24 hours that I've had Testament's new album in my hands, and I've already listened to it six times. I can't put it down! Yet another impeccable delivery from the mighty Testament. I had the chance to catch them live with Anthrax in April 2012 when they played the Metalfest in Santiago. I had seen them many times before in the U.S. and Europe, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear them play so tight after so many years of touring. Dark Roots of Earth reminds me of that recent show. The band sounds like a well-oiled machine, and their individual talents shine brightly. Undoubtedly, Greg and Alex's return to the band is a key factor that has helped the band come full circle. Chuck and Eric are always reliable and make-up 50% of the recognizable Testament sound. Greg's bass lines are imaginative, well recorded, and provide a fullness that few bands have these days. Gene Hoglan is his usual genius in this album. Following in the steps of a long line of amazing drummers who have manned the skins in the band over the years (including Gene himself), I hope this time he'll stick around. Testament is the best complement to his talent and style as he is for the band's abundance of musicality. Last but not least, Alex demonstrates once again why he is by far the best guitarist of the genre, and he adds by himself the remaining 50% of the Testament sound. As a whole, the band sounds like both an old-school and a fresh band filled with creativity and effortless musicianship. Every song in the album could be a single, yet not one of them is radio-oriented. Testament has managed to retain their take-no-prisoners attitude regarding their music without compromising or following trends (take a hint, Metallica!). The deluxe version is awesome; I highly recommend it. Money wellspent!
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are wonderful! There is a lot of very explicit sex but once you accept that, the storyline is wonderful. The author has very vivid descriptions of the characters, they are so real. These books brought out all of the emotions, I laughed, cried and got angry. I couldn't put them down once I started them. I read the first book in paperback, finished it and immediately ordered the trilogy for my Kindle so I could continue and have it to read again. Absolutely a great read!!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet its good I likes it ninjas dude an zombies killing eachother kill kill kill kill. everything lol its a good time consumer
0439023521|5.0|I lucked out.  I worked at a bookstore that had galleys (Advanced Reader Copies) of this book and I grabbed one because a co-worker in the Children's Department spoke so highly of it.  Then it sat on my desk for a year and half collecting dust, until one day, needing something to read, I finally picked it up and within 20 pages began mentally kicking myself for going so long with out reading it!<br />Collin's descriptions of this future dystopian nightmare are so vivid that when the characters actually get to eat, you feel just as gratified as they must be.  Survival takes on a whole new meaning in this series.  I think this is why I loved it so much.  In our age of instant gratification and communication, feeling so removed from my life and being inserted into Katniss' was a treat, despite her dire circumstances.<br />What would we do if we had to hunt for our food in order to not starve to death?<br />To live everyday in fear of a fascist government that could obliterate our existence at any moment?  To have to literally fight to the death to save our own life?<br />The characters are fantastic.  I have heard from others that Katniss came across as un-nuanced and boring.  I completely disagree.  Is she supposed to be giggly and cheerful living in this hell?  Surviving another day and feeding her family is the only thing on this young woman's mind, and I felt that with her every step of the way.  I was on the edge of my proverbial seat every second of this book, and over-joyed when I discovered it was a trilogy.  This is YA fiction, but like Harry Potter, it has mass appeal.  A definite must read.  Just be sure to give yourself a little time because you won't be able to put it down or rest until you find out how it all ends . . .
B0076L9W9Q|3.0|Very disappointed by this album, there are a few decent songs... but some of these are throw aways.. In your room is horible.... I am beutiful with you was written for only teannage girls (seems to be the theme on this one) Nothing is close to Familiar Taste of Poison.<br /><br />Even the easy to listen to rockers are simply and seem to be the ones that were rejected from the last album.<br /><br />I would have loved a full blown version of \\"Rose in December\\" instead of 3 of the ones that did make it.<br /><br />WIth that in mind, Skipp this one and play their last one.... Even the EP's were better
0525953728|2.0|I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because they guy paid his dues and he was an accomplished DEVGRU SEAL & special forces operator...right up until the point he wrote this book/axe to grind. He doesn't give away secrets, tactics or violate OPSEC as far as I can see and it is an interesting easy read from the first hand vantage point. Even though he at times is really humble, at others he is overly full of himself. There are no real big bombshells here and him stating the need to \\"set the record straight\\" is not that big of a deal...a few minor details that are different from the official story. Lots of hype and some cheap shots at the Commander in Chief. He claims on 60 minutes that this is not a political book but the last paragraph is a lame translucent swipe at the President. Lost all credibility for me at that point, not to mention he broke serious codes that Tier 1 Operators take very seriously. Burned his brotherhood for the most part and sold out for a paycheck because he was shown the door at DEV. I am sure there is back-story to all of this but you won't find it here. Shame.
B004LROUNG|4.0|It's been awhile since I last read or listened to a Grisham novel.  I was pleasantly suprised by the tongue-in-cheek approach to lawyers and their methods for practicing law.  From the legal secretary to the office mascot (a dog) he deals with a wildly disparate cast of characters.  Even the attempted arsonist comes across as amusing.  All-in-all, not the most compelling or griping novel I've recently read, but one certainly worth the time...a \\"vacation\\" book, for sure.
B008602KQI|5.0|Im of an older crowd and really get impressed at how they can make movies like this. The story of this movie goes well,and keeps the audience on edge and involved .
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Read to be encouraged as a person. I was amazed at his grasp of acknowledging the \\"Evil\\" that so easily came to  entrap him. He was able to do this because his relationship with a Holy God. In his humanness he was going to loose but in Christ & with his wife as his accountability partner he stood well armed to fight both the spiritual battles of evil & physical.
B000IDEORY|4.0|Seen this movie many years ago and wanted it in my library. Building a library for my Grandchildren to enjoy and feel this is one of the classic's that belong to those in the future. Thank you Amazon for being a go to place for most all my need's.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books are awesome. First time reading this author.<br />I found each of these books very hard to put down.<br />Nothing got down except reading til the very end.<br />Keeps you on the edge of your seat !!!!!!
B006T5FDLG|1.0|Yes they are getting older and should embrace it. There is nothing wrong with slowing down. They are trying too hard. I did like everything up to Newstead departure(I wasnt stuck in the pre video/burton days), then couple of songs on st. anger, DM(LULU I didnt even bother-not wasting anymore time/money). Heard a couple of the songs on BM-garbage. Guys, its OK, getting older is not a terrible thing, you dont have to try and recreate the whiplash days to be relevent, move on. Maybe hang out with Newstead some more.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I can't express in words how much I loved this book but I guess I'll try...after reading 50 shades and Bared to you and not being able to wait for the next installment I went crazy. I found Beautiful Disaster and could not put the book down. I finished the book in a day and was so upset when I did because it was over :( After searching all over the internet for books similar to this that can help me I came across some amazing news. There is going to be a second book to BD called Walking Disaster which releases in April of next year! Ahhhh I loved this book I can't say it enough, you NEED to buy it!!!!
B00122MY90|5.0|Love this, Michael Buble never disappoints. Good quality sound, I listen to this on my Kindle. I highly reccommend this album.

B008Z9YGEE|1.0|Don't waste your time watching this 'B' movie. Could not have been worse. The story (yes I know it was a book) was rushed and therefore leaves you wanting more depth.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|After installing this cooler to replace the factory cooler on my AMD Phenom II X6 1100T, my temps dropped over 10 degrees C. Installation was pretty simple. I added an additional 120mm fan to the cooler and was pleased that the mounting bracket for a second fan is provided in this kit. This cooler is an extremely good value considering how well it works. It will work as good as if not better than cpu coolers costing 4 times as much. I can't get over how inexpensive it is. The only negative I could see is the size. It is huge! Plenty of room in my mid-atx sized case but anything smaller, it might be tight. Installation note: I used the highly rated Arctic Silver 5 thermal paste even though this cooler does come with it's own paste and, after you mount the cooler there is some twist between the cooler base and cpu but that's normal. Just line it up straight and leave it.
0307474259|5.0|There's not much I can say about this remarkable book that hasn't been said by other reviewers. I would only add that Mr Taubes' clarity and dispassionate style are wonderfully refreshing, in contrast to much of what I see, hear and read these days in the realm of alleged non-fiction. The book is worth reading just for that.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Ken Follett is one of the greatest writers of our time.  \\"Eye of the Needle\\" is one of those books you can't  put down and don't want to end.
0582411599|3.0|I love the book! Why did you change the teacher to a monkey? Please send me the original big book with the teacher in it! Ugh!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I love this headset but it does have one problem.  If you look up reviews on this product you'll likely see that the wireless cuts in and out frequently. From what I can tell, there was a defect in a batch of these headsets.  When I called in after the basic trouble shooting was done and the product identification numbers were given to customer service, they immediately send me a new headset.<br />This new headset is far better but still suffers from the dropped connection from time to time but not nearly as bad as the initial headset.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|First of all, lets get one thing straight. I am not an avid fiction reader, specifically i enjoy books about new (and old) archeological and scientific discoveries/theories, or more simply, smart books. But every now and then ill find a piece of fiction that fits my criteria, that is it has to be controversial and/or my Baptist Christian family members have to consider it to be from hell itself. This book fit them both. I picked it up at Walmart and started reading it and couldn't put it down the whole rest of the day, and of course when i was done i felt horrible. I tried to convince myself that i should finish Aristotle but i couldn't find it in myself. I didn't read ANY smart books until i was done with the whole series. I LOVED the characters and the post-apocalyptic setting. This book WILL be on the classics list the next century.
0452289963|5.0|I honestly believe this book should be read by the whole world..its so interesting I couldn't stop reading it.He keeps it simple and is not speaking in codes he just tells us how he perceives things.
B007RTUPTS|3.0|A few good tunes on this album but not a standout.  Fans will appreciate it more.  Excellent packaging and sound.
0307951529|5.0|This book was inspirational.  It's easy to read and has great ideas for starting your own business. The stories were so detailed, you could easily follow the examples given.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|I saw this movie once and instantly fell in love with its story and characters!  I knew it was one I had to add to my collection.  The plot - like the heroine - is quirky and sweet with just the right amount of comedy. The English subtitles don't take away at all from the narration - or the lovely voice of the narrator.  The only negative - it makes me desperate to live in Paris!
0525953728|5.0|I just finished Mark Owen's book \\"No Easy Day\\", an insider's perspective on two very public American Special Operations missions -- the Maersk Alabama recovery and the raid on the Usama bin Laden compound in Pakistan. It also contains details on a mission to rescue the only American known to be held captive in the war in Afghanistan. Aside from this third mission, the book is very close to Chuck Pfarrer's book \\"[[ASIN:1250014719 SEAL Target Geronimo: The Inside Story of the Mission to Kill Osama bin Laden]]\\". The primary difference is that Pfarrer's book is an outsider's perspective looking in.<br /><br />I loved the fact this was an unpolished non-commissioned officer's perspective on the war. There is no political correctness. It is blunt, in-your-face, tell you the truth writing. And I loved it, but some people may be incredibly surprised by how pedestrian the details can be. The guy comes back from a mission and he goes to Taco Bell. Coming back from deployments becomes incredibly mundane. I came back from a deployment and my first stop was Five Guys for a burger...<br /><br />Pfarrer's book covers areas of the mission planning such as the setup of the mission planning and the flight to and from the forward refueling site.  Owen's book offers far more details on what happened inside the compound, and completely contradicts Pfarrer's book in some areas. Owens' book should be considered far more authoritative, because he claims to have first-hand knowledge of the event.<br /><br />The same logic also applies to the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, who was captured by Somali pirates in March 2011. Owen claims to have been part of the team that was there during the rescue. Pfarrer's book offers an outsider's perspective of this event too.<br /><br />Owen's book is a great read. I loved it and finished it in about three days.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I am usually very skeptical of books to movies, however I enjoyed this adaptation of the book to the movie. There are some details that were missed that I'm curious how they will make it up. Also there were some minor details that would have been easy to replicate that they skipped. Overall, a fantastic movie. Well done and an enjoyable watch.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I absolutely loved this documentary! It really showed who Bob was as a man, father, husband, and humanitarian.  I have even more respect for how he lived his life after seeing this.
B005HEWJ2G|4.0|pretty good show, not the best but I've seen worse STNG episodes and I'm a big STNG fan.  If you haven't seen it than you'll probably like it.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Both of these actors are very lovable and were born to play in this movie opposite each other. I don't think I would miss either's movies on purpose but I had to own this one so that I could watch it a couple of times a year.Thanks for having this for me Amazon.
B005HEWEN0|5.0|I like voyager, not as much as STNG. I really liked this episode, it was very 'human.' Neelix and the other characters are very believable.  Good story too, \\"maybe you need to stop hating your self first\\"

0307592731|3.0|Wild  - From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail by Cheryl Strayed is not one of my normal reads. I picked it up because it was on Oprah's Book Club and it had been a while since I read one of her book club selections. I found this book so very sad at least in the beginning when the author wrote about the loss of her mother. It was then that her life spiraled into a lot of bad decisions. This brought about her last name Strayed. She changed it when she divorced. I was so amazed that she wanted to hike the Pacific Crest Trail enough to sell what she had and go for it. She was broken on the inside and not experienced at the hiking thing. I was conflicted about Sheryl's story because I watched her hurt her husband and move on seemingly so easily yet so hurting. I was amazed at how  she was so trusting of people , it was nothing for her to hitch hike , go to people's homes that she did not know ,even a man  who gave her natural grown opium she took it. I cringed for her safety.  I was amazed at how quick she ran into having sex with men.  I have to say I was glad that she had time; time to heal all along the way. I was glad that she was able to find her mom's memories in reading the book authors he mom had read, and in the flowers she passed along the way in the trail. I was amazed at the people she met along the way along the way on her trip from her start in the Mojave Desert in the California to Ashley Oregon. This author wrote very candidly about her life. This book is full of adventure along the trail.  This book is about finding one's self and even forgiving oneself. I give this book three my three star rating it is good but I did have a hard time getting this book read.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Alot has already been said about this book, so I'll be brief.  I found it not only an enjoyable read, but incredibly thought provoking.  There are more than a few lessons to take with you from this book.  Oh, and it's a really fast read.  So don't spend alot of time analyzing, trust your thin-slice judgement, and pick this one up!
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a really juicy romance novel. I really enjoyed reading it. I recommend it highly to any one questioning to buy it.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|Great movie The Mechanic! The price was right, too. The plot is somewhat different than the original, but I liked it just as much.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin has out done himself again. This book was so good I could not put it down, which is a problem when you're reading instead of working on school projects. Don't let that dissuade you from reading this book however. It's well worth the time and the price. 5 stars.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I absolutely loved this book...until I read the ending. The first part was an averaged paced read where she set up the plot, then the second part is a total page turner because the author reveals a huge plot twist. Then you get to the third part where the main characters completely unravel into despicable and unbelievable people who aren't exactly like the characters you've gotten to know throughout the novel. The last chapter is the worst. It's like the author was like: \\"I'm tired of writing, so I'll just write a paragraph to end it.\\" I was extremely disappointed by the ending and it was a waste of the hours I spent engrossed in the book. If she was confused as to how to end it, I could have given her ideas and suggestions on ways the \\"perfect\\" main character could have made a mistake or her husband could have avenged the wrongs done to him...Could have easily been a 5 star book if she had chosen to end it...
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I bought the purple case cover, I love the shade. Funtional, and feels sturdy, I'd be okay with it in a backpack or purse. I use the elastic to hold back the front flap, and I often set it up to watch movies, the case allows for both options very well. I love that the speakers aren't blocked by clips. I'd say I'm gentle to fair on how often I use it, and how rough I am. For example, I prefer Body Gloves for my phones. If I used my Fire daily, or went out with it a lot, I think I'd go with something stronger. But for me, for the price, I can't say anything against this case, it suits all my needs.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Well written, imaginative, good adventure.  In writing about rabbits you soon see the author bringing out the parallel to humans.  Writers are always comparing people to wolves or lions or other predatory mammals.  As Adams points out in this adventure tale, we are much more like rabbits.  Brave rabbits, but still rabbits.  Which, when you consider how ill equipped we are by Nature to defend ourselves (except with our minds), the rabbit comparison is much more apt.<br /><br />Adams does a good job and I can see why this book is becoming a classic.<br />  GvG

B0061PEAUY|3.0|Although the book has it's moments and the twist and turns towards the end may surprise you, Kathy Reichs has written better books than this one. Some of the descriptions (p.e. about finding diamonts) are very long and rather boring. I also missed a certain tension bow that made her earlier books real page turners.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|I'm in the middle of book 2. The story is great. Get the kindle version as long as you don't mind occasional missing text. So far in about 8 places:  I cant tell, since it's between screens, how much is skipped--not so much to lose the sense but enough to pull you out of the text. If I didn't want the larger font, I'd try to return it. Dumb. This shouldn't be a problem.

B0025KVLUG|5.0|\\"Only A Northern Song\\", Hey Bulldog\\", \\"All Together Now\\", and \\"It's All Too Much\\" are the new Beatles songs on this soundtrack album.  \\"Hey Bulldog\\" is a ferocious Lennon tune featuring McCartney's manic, high-register bass playing.  \\"It's All Too Much\\" is Harrison's contribution to English psychedelia, with the requisite North of England brass band notes.  It could have been the closing song on Sgt. Pepper if \\"A Day In The Life\\" was not available (blasphemy!).  \\"Bulldog\\" and \\"Too Much\\" also helped to spawn the career of the Beatles-echoing Klaatu.  But the real pleasure of Yellow Submarine, found when I flipped over the vinyl album more than forty years ago, is George Martin's music for the film.  Martin borrows from J. S. Bach (\\"Air On The G String\\"), and G. Harrison (\\"Within You Without You\\"), among others.  His best track is the opener \\"Pepperland\\", a wistful piece with a hint of melancholy that invites the listener into the land of cartoon make-believe.  I was anxious to hear this instrumental music remastered, especially after listening to Martin's own redo of this music on his albums.  When the \\"new\\" Yellow Submarine soundtrack was released in 1999 without Martin's contribution, I feared it would be lost forever.
B0071WQ7WU|3.0|If I keep reading about how these guys are growing as artists...I'm going to start expecting it. Love Shinedown but this wasnt one of my favorite cds. This cd didnt make me want to play it over and over again. Their other cds have had that effect. That being said, its an average cd nothing to lose sleep or $10 over. Borrow cd from your Shinedown friend and see where u stand before purchasing.
0517543052|2.0|I was really fascinated and pulled in to this book when I was younger, and in fact organized my whole life around it for a year or two. I think there's a lot of wisdom there but it's mixed with a lot of spiritual materialism - constant judging and measuring about how \\"high\\" he and other people / gurus are - that I ended up picking up myself from reading. It had me constantly wondering how \\"far along the path\\" I was, how I stacked up spiritually compared to others, etc. A lot of bullshit I think, that polluted my thinking for a long time.<br /><br />I have trouble believing the miracle stories also - if these miracle-manifesting gurus are so ubiquitous in India, as Autobiography of a Yogi and other books would suggest, wouldn't we have had one scientist over the last 100 years investigate and back the stories up experimentally? Wouldn't a guru freely give a demonstration in some controlled environment if these kinds of powers were real and it inspired faith in millions of people and set them on the spiritual path? In the age of cell phone video, wouldn't we have a plethora of hard-to-deny miracles online? Instead the only documented things I find are debunking of these types of psychics and miracle workers, showing how levitation tricks, blowing fire, \\"conjuring\\" things, mind reading etc. work.<br /><br />Not sure what to make of Ram Dass's tales in that regard - perhaps he was in an impressionable state and got taken in by guru parlor tricks and charisma - or perhaps he can rationalize making up such stories for the faith they inspire in people to start them on the spiritual path. I don't know.<br /><br />A reviewer in this section who gave a one-star rating mentioned that he met Ram Dass's boarding school teacher from his teenage years, who said that at the time Ram Dass was gay and felt forced to hide it, and was ostracized by his fellow classmates, perhaps for the same reason. Ram Dass admitted much later in life his bisexuality with a preference for men. That reviewer's amateur interpretation actually makes some sense to me - \\"a teen with a secret, lonely and shunned, seeks mass approval later in life, and a solution for stifling his own inner demons\\".<br /><br />For as honest and personal as Ram Dass seems to be I find it surprising he makes no mention of his sexuality in his books. It would seem he was editing and filtering himself, maybe out of a desire for public approval, which could provide a motivation beind throwing in a few miracle stories too. Obviously it took the world by storm when he did.<br /><br />Anyway it all leaves me a little confused. There's no question this book is powerful and profound in many ways, but when I look back on my own experience trying to live by it I don't know if it made me wiser or screwed me up. Maybe a bit of both.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Very interesting band, that continues to maintain a sound and style their own. Im not buying into the bs about having growth on every cd but I like their sound. I will say: I enjoy their music. Been a fan for a few years, saw em in concert...their a band that really is amazing live.
B0055SWM08|5.0|but i was going to anyway. ok. so i bought quell b/c i was running out of levels in quell reflect, even after replaying each one till i could do it perfectly. i was worried about what i'd do when i ran out of quell. and i still am. this (original) version is equally awesome, albeit somewhat easier than quell reflect. but i love it... it's soothing and it makes me feel like a smarty-pants because unlike in the sequel i am able to perfect a lot of the levels on my first try. and the others, i do them over and over till i get them in the minimum number of moves. trying to save up my hints for when i really nedd them. i think finishing this game will make me more prepared than ever to take on quell reflect. but soo  i'll be done with both. i can only hope for a new incarnation of quell to be released. what i will do between quells, i have no idea.
B00511ONPG|5.0|Dave Kerpen is an expert in the field of social media and word of mouth marketing.  He is not someone sitting on the outside and looking in telling you how it should be done.  He is actually in the trenches, doing this kind of work every day.  He uses examples from his own business, Likeable Media, to illustrate his points.<br /><br />This book is about social media strategies and uses examples from many of the major social sites.  This book is not going to teach you how to use each of the social media sites, but it will give you a bit of an overview of each of the major players.  What Mr. Kerpen is trying to do in this book is teach you how to  use social media to build relationships and be likeable.  The book starts off by talking about how to define your target audience and moves into how to communicate with them.  While you are communicating with your friends/fans/followers, common situations come up that may give people pause.  Mr. Kerpen does a great job of addressing these issues such as comments (both good and bad), questions, and authenticity.  He then wraps things up by talking about  incorporating social media into the whole customer experience.  In a way, the titles of the last two chapters do a good job of summing up the book. Consistently Deliver Excitement, Surprise, and Delight ﻿and Don't Sell! Just Make It Easy and Compelling for Customers to Buy.﻿<br /><br />This book was a quick and easy read.  This doesn't mean it doesn't have depth though.  It is so interesting and enjoyable, it would not be surprising for someone to sit down and crank it out in an afternoon.  The information is fresh, yet it is also timeless.  If in 15 years Facebook and Twitter have been replaced by something else, this book will still be able to be used as a road map to getting and keeping fans.  In addition to being relevant information, the book was also enjoyable to read.  The examples were interesting because I knew that each one was taken right from Mr. Kerpen's actual business experience.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that this book is a must read for anyone in social media.  Everyone from rookies to veterans will find something of value in this book.  I give it a solid 5 star rating!

B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I actually really enjoyed this movie. I was, like most people (I think) worried that Bella Swan would show up biting her lip and ruin the movie but...honestly, it's was like a different actress was cast. Kristen Stewart was actually very enjoyable to watch. She's grown as an actress which is nice, good for her. Now, Charlize Theron was simply the best. So creepy and crazy; she really made the film. I don't need to go on about her talent, everyone should just know by now ;o)<br />The acting was good. The colors and filming were great and the story was pretty solid. I liked the bonus features which I found entertaining and informative so yeah, I recommend this Blu ray package.

(i.e. \\"John The Revelator\\").<br /><br />Also, the female voices fits great.<br /><br />Don't expect freak show excess!<br />Enjoy.
0205632645|5.0|I received [[ASIN:0205632645 The Elements of Style: 50th Anniversary Edition]] from a very close friend a few years back, and she was someone who understood my love for this book that goes back to my college days in the 1970s. Someone once asked me how I was able to hold a 3.9 average in college back in the post-Vietnam era when as a veteran I was in school and working full time. My answer then is as it is now: \\"Strunk and White.\\"<br /><br />But if my friend reads this, I hope that she will accept my apology that I rarely open the cover of this book, yet it's one of my most treasured. It's the accepted 4th edition, and now a collectable in this hardbound version. These days I use a well worn paperback edition, [[ASIN:020530902X The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition]], which is still accessed at least a few times a week. I just heep this one on a special bookshelf with my most treasured books, and still glance at it when using the paperback.<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews, both pro and con, posted here on both of the above editions, and I am not as erudite as some of the other reviewers, nor am I an authority. As far as these editions go, Time Magazine listed Strunk & White's 'The Elements of Style' as \\"one of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923\\" in their August 30, 2011 issue. But my concern is that there are many editions of \\"The Elements of Style\\" listed here on Amazon, both in paper and Kindle editions, yet few of them are what the reader may assume are the real ones.<br /><br />For example, this [[ASIN:B006E905JM THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE - The Original Edition (Annotated)]] may not be the edition that you're looking for. It's one of a number of versions of the original title \\"The Elements of Style\\" written by Cornell University English professor William Strunk, Jr., who wrote it 1918. But this is not the version that is also known as \\"Strunk & White.\\" The product description is incorrect.<br /><br />There are other Kindle reissues of the 1918 edition, most notably [[ASIN:B0058I7TFI THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE (UPDATED 2011 EDITION) The All-Time Bestselling Book on Writing English Newly Edited (Special 2011 Edition) The Elements of Style OVER 10 MILLION COPIES SOLD! [Revised]]], which notes that it is newly revised and edited by Chris Hong, who is listed in the electronic flyleaf as a former editor at Harvard University, and bears a © 2011 The Elements of Style Press notation. This particular edition does have a slightly better layout on the Kindle, and the table of contents is well hyperlinked, but no mention is made of original author William Strunk, Jr., except for his name on the flyleaf.<br /><br />Among the other Kindle editions are [[ASIN:B003GSLX5Y The Elements of Style (Original Edition)]], with the quill on it's cover is basic, and it costs under a dollar. But if you're going for basic, the [[ASIN:B005IT0V8O The Elements of Style]] edition with its generic cover is a no-cost freebie. And there are other Kindle editions if you search.<br /><br />The problem with these 1918 editions is that the writing style is dated. Original author Strunk had died in 1946, and in 1959, the publishers commissioned writer and author E. B. White, well known for his [[ASIN:0061124958 Charlotte's Web]], that classic for children, to revise the 41-year-old text. This was was fitting as Strunk had been one of White's professors at Cornell. White's rework of the book was extremely well received, and further editions of the work followed in 1972, 1979, and 1999. White's expansion and modernization of Strunk's original became informally known as Strunk & White. As to whether it's considered a valid part of a writer's bookshelf, more than ten million copies of the three editions of Strunk & White have been sold.<br /><br />The history of this writing manual can be found in Mark Garvey's [[ASIN:B003STCKZ8 Stylized: A Slightly Obsessive History of Strunk & White's The Elements of Style]], which was published in 2009, an excellent book in its own right.<br /><br />So if you're looking for the real Strunk & White, [[ASIN:0205313426 The Elements of Style (4th Edition)]], by William Strunk, Jr. and E. B. White, is one you want, and it's only available in paper editions, except for the rare [[ASIN:0205632645 The Elements of Style: 50th Anniversary Edition]], which is now a collectable. Otherwise, you may enjoy one of the Kindle editions listed here, but think of them more as an interesting background than as contemporary writing style references.<br /><br />9/11/2012n 2009, an excellent book in its own right.<br /><br />So if you're looking for the real Strunk & White, [[ASIN:0205313426 The Elements of Style (4th Edition)]], by William Strunk, Jr. and E.

B00007KWHP|4.0|I love this album.  I'm not a professional reviewer of music but I can tell you that if my kids like the music it seems like it's destined to be a classic.  They have an uncanny sense of taste when it comes to music.  This one was already a classic when they latched onto it.  There's at least one song on here that my son recognized from the Wii game \\"Rock Band III\\" and also from the movie \\"School of Rock\\" which is one of our family favorites.  He asks me to play this CD over and over in the car for him.  Kid has good taste.
0345803485|1.0|This is such a whiney piece of ### I don't know where to start.  Too much angst. I'm a mom.  I observe angst all day.  Why would I want to read about it?  You could cut out 2/3 of this book and not notice.  At least it wouldn't be as long. This is almost vanilla.  No heat but a lot of smoke. I'm sure this is because it was written while stoned. The sex is juvenile.  You wonder if this girl just came out of a convent except that nuns are more worldly about sex.  It's only good for unintentional laughs- and not too many of those. I couldn't care about the main characters. There is no plot.  It's just rambling about art, music, fancy clothes, why am I so stupid? he is so hot! he's so rich! MY Friends are rich? OMG did I just do that? She is the Urquel of romantic heroines.<br /><br />Women are not getting enough if this is popular.  It's like getting excited over a damp wash cloth.<br /><br />There are better stories like this out there. For instance \\"Dominated by a Billionaire\\"- series.[[ASIN:B007VA2HEY Anything He Wants (Dominated By The Billionaire)]]  It's a lot more plausible, steamier, and not nearly as whiney.  If you really like the BDSM stuff look into the 'Brie' series by Red Pheonix-.  It's a more explicit and deals with a series of partners a young woman has on in her training to be a sub.

B000002KCC|5.0|I have been listening to Neil Young for over 38 years and this album is crucial to his work. If you want cheery, polished, gift wrapped music for the family don't buy this album. This album like most of Neil's early work is raw in your face reality of the time! To those who commented he was probably drunk...ya your point? He was probably loaded on many different kinds of things for most of his albums. What were you doing in the 70's and 80's?<br /><br />To make my point, I personally have lost several friends and even family members to legal or illegal drugs and alcohol. I am pretty sure anyone who was part of \\"The Scene\\" in the 70's and 80's can relate to the music Mr Young put down in this \\"from the gut\\" raw album. It brings me joy and sorrow every time I listen to it as did those times. There are lots of great artists that do similar work like Tom Petty and Mick Jagger that are still alive. There are a lot more like Mamma Cass and Jimmy Hendrix that arn't. Neil Youngs Tonights The Night album didn't just relay his feelings of the time in a couple songs though. No because what makes Neil so special and famous is his ability to sing real down to earth songs that honestly depict the times as they were and are. For just him or just me? Well i think his huge following for so many years says it all.<br /><br />I don't like the percentage of newer stuff compared to the first 20 years but hey do you perform as good today as you did 20 years ago? And I have changed as well. My music taste has expanded to other types and as a computer engineer I simply don't have the time to devote to it. But with Neil Young, Mick Jaggar, Crosby Stills & Nash and a few others I can go back and reflect or here new material and feel part of something again. Seems most people I see or hear on video (other) these days are afraid to stand up to the system , government...well \\"The Man\\". These guys all did it and many times at the cost of their freedom or personal lives.<br /><br />I thank the Lord for the privilege of being part of the most radically changing and diversified time in America. I also thank the Lord for people like Neil Young who arn't afraid to say what they are feeling inside because it isn't popular or fun. Thats what true \\"Rock N Roll\\" was meant to be I think as it was born out of folk and blues. Sometimes I have to listen to his work many times before I appreciate what it's saying now days but it still remains raw with no gift wrapping! Keep it coming Neil we appreciate your honesty thru all your hard work and sacrifice!

One of the best books I read on the subject of being happy, and WHY it's so important! Please read, you deserve it, because your life matters! @TimmyKC
B004ZNANZA|2.0|Why they couldn't put the entire Wall on one cd (it is 2012!) and then put the live versions on the other two cds?  No one is going to listen to these demos more than once.  The other 2 Experience editions are worthwhile, but again, why not some live material on the earlier albums?  Live material from some old tv specials could have been backed on More or Meddle - just as one example.  I've been listening to Pink Floyd since the 1st album, which we had to buy as an Import when it first came out, so I'm an old-time fan.  I'd give the Wall 5 stars in general but not this.  The one good thing I can say is you can buy all the basic 2011 remasters at a decent price.

0312962118|5.0|Have just recently started reading Glenn Meade's books (have his latest \\"Romanov\\" on reserve at library when it comes in)  and ordered this one via interlibrary loan from my library.  Was not sure that this far distant from the Stalin era that I would find this one enjoyable, but was I wrong!  Held interest from the start and as with his other books he blends facts with fiction in a way that brings the events he is discussing to life.  Just don't start this one when you are ready to turn in for the night....unless you want a sleepless night from reading late.
B008220CFG|3.0|As a horror fan I was really excited to see this movie as it was compared to \\"The Exorcist\\", and although that movie is tame by today's standards it scared the **** out of me when I saw it. So I figured with today's special effects this should be great. And to top it all off, the movie starts by saying it was based on a true story. Well, it had it's moments, but it took almost three quarters of the movie to find out what was possessing the young girl (who was great, by the way) and even then, the effects were really nothing to write home about. There was a good twist at the end - which possibly leaves an opening for a sequel, because with a little research I found that this may not have been based on a true story at all. The movie was ok, I'm glad I saw it, but the next time I'll do a little bit more research before I believe that any movie is as good as \\"The Exorcist\\".

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  It was poorly written, with no imagination and horrible character development.  The sex scenes were just plain awkward.  And, no, I'm not referring to the bdsm aspect of it.<br />How many times can one person \\"gasp\\" or \\"peek up\\" at someone?  Did the authors vocabulary run low?  Did she not have access to a thesaurus to even try and think of an alternative saying besides \\"my heart was in my mouth\\"?  On a side note here, isn't that expression really \\" my heart was in my throat\\"?  I am amazed that this is a best seller.<br />Maybe they can get Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson to play in this one too.  They wouldn't have to change much....

B0087YMWMU|4.0|I don't understand why so many people rank movies that are obviously made to be \\"bad\\" movies with 1's or 2's.  Call a spade a spade.  Look at the poster work on this movie.  look at the title.  THe fact that it has Christopher Lloyd in it is just brilliant.  I purchased (and enjoyed) how stupid this movie was.  Check out Piranha DD with another movie (similar poster): [[ASIN:B008I744XQ Roadside Massacre]]... Posters are very similar.  Just like Piranha DD, Roadside Massacre is exactly what you expect it to be (and it was terrific too).  I'm a huge fan of cult cinema, I'm always looking for that next amazing gem of a discovery.

030758836X|3.0|The first half of this book is psychologically brilliant: men will learn a lot about straight male psychology from Flynn's male lead, particularly the tie between needing to be liked and engaging in continuous low-grade cruelty. There's lots of good stuff about the sadism of kindly, self-centered parents and about the nation's emotional life  that seems to be led via TV.  Hopefully middle Americans are NOT as completely manipulable by canned emotional pitches as are the ones in this book.  But the last third is written as though that same empty media had taken over Flynn herself.  The lead characters become stereotyped and ridiculous, shedding their previous depth and plausibility  Did Flynn start writing with the Hollywood option that this book later received? Are we really supposed to line up for another turn of the femme fatale screw? What happened? I was so disappointed.
B003A3K3JW|5.0|The Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela play Stravinsky's masterpiece with all the hormone-laden fury and intensity that the score deserves. This is probably the most orgiastic music ever composed and it needs a comparable interpretation and performance. Dudamel and his band of superb musicians supremely rise to the occasion. After all, who better to play this music than a bunch of energetic and horny young musicians?! I've heard 'Le Sacre' live and on recording countless times and I can state without any reservation that this is not just the best CD version available, it is the best performance and interpretation of \\"Le Sacre\\" I have ever heard. A definite MUST-OWN for every music lover. The wonderful Revueltas piece is icing on the cake - even if it were just \\"Le Sacre\\", this CD would be an essential purchase. Brilliant music-making and an exhausting and cathartic experience. (Put this CD on LOUD when your friends complain about classical music being \\"too boring\\"!!)
0756913675|5.0|I really love this book and bought it again as a gift for a friend. Unfortunately, the cover was different than what was listed; I was hoping it was going to be the original with the trees but instead featured the movie poster. Other than that, still very happy!

B004NSUXHU|4.0|CHRISTMAS AT DOWNTON ABBEY is the movie-length 2011 finale for Season Two of the series.  For some reason it is sold separately from the Season 2 set in the UK but is included in the American PBS DVD/Blu-ray releases.<br /><br />The year is 1919, and the inhabitants of Downton Abbey are celebrating the first Christmas of peacetime, but the trial of Bates (Brendan Coyle) for the murder of his wife casts a shadow over the otherwise-bright festivities.  The Crawleys rally around Anna (Joanne Froggatt) but the outcome doesn't look promising.  Thomas (Rob James-Collier), back to being a regular old footman, once again wants Bates' job as Robert's (Hugh Bonneville) valet, but he is still regarded as untrustworthy for such an intimate position.<br /><br />Downstairs, Daisy (Sophie McShera) is still racked with guilt over her \\"sham wedding\\" to William and the frequent visits of William's lonely father.  She is also becoming increasingly frustrated with the limitations of her job and ponders leaving Downton to become a fully-fledged cook.<br /><br />Upstairs, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) is rapidly discovering what an absolute jackass Sir Richard Carlisle (Iain Glen) really is, during Downton's traditional Christmas activities, where he is by turns snobbish, jealous and outright rude towards members of the Crawley family.  Since Richard could potentially destroy Mary's reputation within a heartbeat, will she decide to marry him or risk it all for another chance with Matthew (Dan Stevens)?<br /><br />With the absence of Lady Sybil (now married and living in Ireland with Branson), there's room for another upstairs plot, which is taken by Robert's sister Lady Rosamund Painswick (Samantha Bond) - who is considering getting married once more, but whose suitor (Nigel Havers) seems to be more taken with her considerable fortune (and ladies' maid, played by Sharon Small).<br /><br />This special movie-length DOWNTON ABBEY episode features all the cast favourites (including the peerless Dame Maggie Smith dishing out more withering observations as Dowager Countess Violet) and most importantly sets the scene for Season Three, which, as of this review's writing, is about to start airing on ITV in the United Kingdom.ess Dame Maggie Smith dishing out more withering observations as Dowager Countess Violet) and most importantly sets the scene for Season Three, which, as of this review's writing, is about to start airing on ITV in the United Kingdom.

1476712042|5.0|I am not a big reader.  Quite frankly, until Fifty Shades, I had only read 1 book for pleasure since college (11 years).  I went through Fifty Shades quickly, straight to Bared to You and then on to Beautiful Disaster.  Beautiful Disaster totally consumed me.  I found myself crying, heart racing and physically restraining myself from flipping to the end to ensure everything turned out ok.<br /><br />Travis captured my heart.  I could feel his desire, his need and his heart-break.  In my heart I was yelling at Abby (restrained from yelling aloud due to sleeping children!) and couldn't take myself away from the book until I was done in the early hours of the morning, having started it after putting the children to bed.<br /><br />I've never had a book consume me in this way.  I've even bought the audio book so that I can now listen to it while on a long roadtrip by myself so that I can 're-read' it.  My husband thinks I'm nuts.<br /><br />Needless to say, my heart races even thinking about reading Walking Disaster.  I CAN'T WAIT!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I hats games that force you to have neighbors or friends or pay $ to advance.  I like this game but this is a huge negative.  I don't want to bug my friends to play a silly game! Also, it doesn't allow you to have all of your winnings. Won 50 energy but was only given a few of them because apparently I was almost maxed out for that level. That's not right. You should be able to get as much energy as you've earned. Also, it's near impossible to get all your tasks done when you are only given ONE new energy every 3 minutes. I have to have the game open ALL day to do anything. Who has time for that?
0525953728|5.0|I have read a lot of fictional books about Seals.  This was way better for the historical context, AND THE FACT IT WAS ALL TRUE.  Chills ran down my spine and my eyes filled with tears of gratitude of the fallen soldiers listed at the back of the book.  I almost skipped them, then I thought to myself, how can I read every word of this 300 page book, then not read the names of the fallen?  I read every name and tried hard to pronounce the name as correctly and as reverently as I could.  It had a real impact on me.  I am glad he included that and I am glad I didn't just set the book on my nightstand.  Thanks to all the Armed Forces out there.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Many detailed reviews about the wonders of this backpack have been written, so I'll be brief.<br /><br />-SO MANY POCKETS AND POUCHES!!! If you're a little obsessive-compulsive, you will really love having a place for everything and then some.<br />-Large and spacious. I could easily fit several textbooks into the middle compartment (the one with the padded fold-down bottom flap.)<br />-Thickly padded laptop compartment<br />-Material is sturdy<br />-Straps and back are heavily padded for comfort<br />-Faux-leather bottom provides extra stability and waterproof protection<br />-Stylish and attractive--lots of great detailing (e.g., zipper pulls)<br /><br />I wish the bag had a front carabiner clip and individual slots for pens/pencils, but you can't have everything. Even without these features, this is clearly a top-of-the-line backpack. With the quality construction, I expect the pack to last me for several years.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|\\"Pines\\" is a taught, psychological thriller that feels, to me, like a mix between a spooky, small-town similar to David Lynch's \\"Twin Peaks\\" or \\"The Midwich Cuckoos\\", and the white-knuckled action of Alistair MacLean. In fact, now that I have finished, I could place it alongside H.G. Well's \\"Island of Doctor Moreau\\"  as a book of action, ideas and world-building that makes you think both inside and outside the action.<br /><br />Couch's style is amazing. His prose is jagged, and perfectly captures the action. Heavy on verbs, often omitting adverbs, his style says one thing. \\"Watch the action.\\" And, because of the clarity of his vision, you do focus.<br /><br />I don't want to include any spoilers, but from 30,000 feet, this book says a lot about the \\"warrior\\" ethic. Warriors kill, but they are fighting to protect that which is dear to them: their families and civilizations. Saying anything else would spoil the reading.<br /><br />So I'll keep my yap shut, And just say this: \\"Enjoy.\\"

i don't know. i don't even know how i once made a living as a writer because i can never come up with words when i'm forced out of my retarded, self-absorbed preverbal reveries. but \\"weather,\\" oy. after loving her work so long this work makes me reconsider falling in love with a woman again for that kind of cellular depth, but i don't know if i'd make it back this time. her love songs, and me'shell also has loved everybody, i think, \\"how did she do it all? pay the bills and be so available and naked, and have the stamina to keep showing back up as more of herself?\\" i don't know. but the song \\"feeling for the wall\\" has you bypass condescendingly patting her on the head to slithering all over her in some kind of \\"it'll be okay\\" thing that love is always about when it's best and you get to forget the expanse of the universe, etcetera etcetera.<br /><br />(hey, we ALL end up slithering all over Me'Shell at some point or another if you're really listening)<br /><br />but then you realize SHE'S really slithering all over YOU with her work, and that's why her work is a subscription to a love affair that's no safer because it's aural or emotional.<br /><br />and then you also realize this is WHY she has so many heart-tearing and expansive love songs: because people play with her and think they're up for the intensity but it's like staring too long at the sun.<br /><br />see, THEY can't even pay the bills, do their art, and have the love affair with Me'Shell.<br /><br />she's a SUPERHERO. she swaggers in the kind of emotional nudity that leaves others gelatinous.<br />plus she makes pretty out ofit all. that abyss thang. yeah.<br /><br />i got this whole album (or whatever they're called these new fangled days. i feel like i come from wax cylinders now that i've quit living so digitally and returned to a much more analogue life) anyhow, i got this when it first came out, but i have to set aside time in my life to commit to listening to it and letting every molecule in my being inhale it. she's intense, even for me and i'm used to people running out on me in bed. yup. middle of everything and all.<br /><br />this is the sad tragedy of her and all who're so intense and alive in this world. they see and live between the atoms. they don't want the callouses everyone else wants so they can be charming at a party once in awhile.<br /><br />(i can't do it. i'm at level one where i'm still having tantrums and they're worse now that i'm 45 and see the reality of behaving like dead people)<br /><br />anyhow,<br /><br />yeah, me'shell's work is like a subscription to the earth. the ground. but a subscription yourself as well as others: you're not alone. and you smile. and you're in that \\"bhuddistian\\" here-and-now thing and forget to be immortal, because only then are you connected and truly immortal anyway, right?<br /><br />words all contradict themselves, that's why me'shell's daring to even dance with them.<br /><br />i'm the kind of artist who doesn't understand it when others here say prior works were lacking but this is IT because she's not that kind of \\"hitter.\\" she's operating on a whole other level than some easy listening work. her work is like the sweat of all she's endured, a carbon dated sample of the history of slavery and being a dark woman in a world that calls that \\"evil\\" in a million different ways and black people are still burning their hair straight and blonde and i'm giving 5 stars for the relief that she's still killer. her entire OUEVRE if you will. i always get afraid because i don't know where she'll take me next because her works are like sermons. you can't pull apart a sermon, a scream!<br /><br />and when i listen to her works in their entireties (for she's still an old-fashioned \\"album artist\\"), it feels like all the music that we grew up with never went away. the fight and the groove's still there in her. it didn't get washed away by that corporate sponsorship our \\"revolutions\\" have been recently based on.<br /><br />i'm not a person who thinks \\"accessibility\\" equals \\"success.\\" oh, lort no. in fact i didn't find out about her until long after her initial stints in the light of popular culture. i discovered her when she choked up on a live radio show about the intense love of her daughter and the intensity of life. the british interviewer couldn't take the emotions and cut to \\"commercial.\\"<br /><br />i laughed and thought, \\"poor Me'Shell. what else have you done that makes everyone cut to commercial?\\"<br /><br />and ever since, i check her out when i'm not too tormented/blissed out in my own work, and love that she's always True. and fighting. for that i don't feel alone and useless in my own struggles to honor the fights and lessons that come down from my ancestors, through my parents, and now for to me to honor for all those who come after me like a mother. i didn't have my own biological children, but i'm at that part of an artist's life when i realize we all belong to each other already.<br /><br />--erika lopez<br /><br />(former writer and i don't know what next because i'm already art now but music and dancing are how i pray these days)

1455502758|5.0|This short collection of writings done by Christopher Hitchens detailing his experience with cancer, dying and mortality reminds me in no little way of a 21st century Montaigne. While I was expecting Hitchens stoic materialism to jump off the page, I was also surprised by his gentleness. This is a man who loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved to think, to write and to speak. Is there any greater testament to a life well-lived than to read or listen to a man's final words and walk away from that experience made better by his spirit and his strength? If \\"death is\\", to re-use Bellow's phrase, \\"the dark backing a mirror needs before it can give off a reflection,\\" then Hitch's life and words were that same mirror's silver.

0547569653|5.0|An interesting read for ultra runners and those thinking of getting into ultra races.  Scott Jurek is one of the legends of ultrarunning and his book is educational and a fun read.  The book in part focuses on his success by eating a Vegan diet, complete with starter recipes for those wanting to incorporate more Vegan meals into their plan.  One thing noticeably lacking is much nutritional science behind why eating Vegan is superior to Vegetarian or a healthy Omnivorous diet.  Nonetheless, well worth the price and am looking forward to more by Jurek!
B000MQPKVG|5.0|Well I just watched one of the most impressive movies in the history of film. Stanley Kubrick's quietly glorious & ironically realistic 1975 masterpiece BARRY LYNDON. Starring Ryan O'Neal as a lowly-bred Irish lad, whose impudence dares him to attempt sequestering himself into a higher station among the Peerage of England. Can you even begin to imagine such a thing? I wouldn't dream of spoiling this rich period piece which renders all other powder puff costume dramas obsolete. Filmed with a sophisticated lens Kubrick got from NASA, this film features the lowest F-stop in film history, for you photographers out there. It is mostly filmed in natural light, rendering sweeping shots which resemble a renaissance painting. Yet possibly the greatest thing about BARRY LYNDON is the fact that all the actors transcend their craft and present thoroughly realistic characters. I am beginning to suspect that is one of Kubrick's key strengths, his ability to somehow coerce actors into wholly transforming into their characters, lock, stock, and smoking barrel. If you've avoided seeing BARRY LYNDON on the assumption it is just another awful powder wig yawn fest, think again. This is Stanley Kubrick at his very best.

B008Y2IU12|3.0|At the end of an epic movie like this, I should be smiling wide enough to split my cheeks. I wasn't.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is beautiful and poisonous as the queen. Chris Hemsworth is strong and rugged and handsome as the huntsman, although he was a little light on the emotion. The photography was lush and wonderful and perfect for a story like this. The lack is Kristin Stewart.<br /><br />Kristin Stewart is pretty, but she should never wear her hair slicked back from her face. It makes her look like she has jug ears. That aside, her acting is limited and she made me feel nothing for her. Her wonder was pitiful, her anger forced, her rousing speech pretty lame in delivery, and otherwise, she was just . . . lacking. What this movie needed was a Snow White that would do justice to the rest of the cast and the photography. Kristin Stewart just doesn't have it. I should have been cheering the end of the Queen. Instead, I felt more oh, well, that's over. It was all right. Lukewarm is not what I want from an epic movie and one of my favorite fairy tales.

0307744434|2.0|Beautiful magical descriptions of setting and character. Weak plot and disappointing ending. All of a sudden the book just kind of ended (I won't spoil it - but the ending was quick, and didn't have much to do with the nature of the characters.) Plot is usually character driven - in this case I found them to be unrelated. Not thoroughly satisfying. No ah-hah moment.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games seems to be a sort of metaphor for our times;  the way we celebrate  youth who are sacrificed in wars, the way the world views war, the deprivation, the pursuit of wealth, political propaganda and the revolutions which arise as a result.  No wonder the book is so wildly popular.
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|This is another great album from the CRB. It is nice to have studio versions of Appaloosa and Someday Past the Sunset, both of which were included on previous Black Crowes/Chris & Rich Robinson live albums. Having seen CRB a few times live, the song from their shows that always stuck out was Vibration and the Light Suite. The album version fails to disappoint as it is the highlight of the album. Overall, I feel that Big Moon Ritual is a stronger album altogether, The Magic Door is a different feel and great companion to the vibe that CRB delivers.
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is an amazing story teller, alternating each chapter with characters and unpredictable plots that made it hard to put this book down.  I was excited to read a second book about the Clifton Chronicles and continue where \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" left off.  An exciting historical and fictional combination that has broaden my knowledge and sparked my interest in books about the pre and post WWII days both in England and America.  I can't wait to read more of this author's books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The last book is awesome! I don't write reviews because I am not good at but I loved this one. Parts of it made me sad but I think it ended the way it should have. Spoiler alert I just wish he would have picked Gale.

B0009P66TK|5.0|I have a number of good watches, but saw this on a friend's wrist and liked it immediately. It was hard to find one because they sell like crazy, but eventually found one on Amazon. It's now my everyday beater watch that I don't worry about scratching, mashing or wrecking; the hands are nicely visible at night, and if it dies I'm only out a hundred bucks. I would have preferred the white face but only the black was available.<br /><br />The face is well-organized and legible, and just about the right size. This is a big watch. The left-handed controls are nice for a change - I'm not a leftie but sometimes the controls dig into my wrist if I'm being really active. My only gripe about the watch is that the band is incredibly stiff, causing it to ride on the low side of my wrist. It's also difficult to remove in a hurry, such as going through airport security. This will probably work out over time since I wear it around the clock, in the water a lot, and in the shower, and I'm hoping that in a few months the leather will soften up.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Go over to the amazon.co.uk to see a few reviews of the new blu ray which was released this week in the UK.  All very positive.If you cannot wait to get it, and I wouldn't blame you, it is region free so you can order it from there and it will play in a North American player.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Our book club met last night and had a lengthy and fabulous review of Gone Girl. We all thoroughly enjoyed the book and in particular that the story was told from two narratives of Nick and Amy,the main characters. The book has many twists and turns that keeps you surprised and intrigued up to the very end. The book plays with your mind and some members felt as they were being duped.<br />A good example, of the author providing suspense, is when Nick is staying with his sister,Go, and suspicion of his involvement of his missing wife is rising. There is a knock on the front door and someone is asking to come in.<br />It leaves the reader anxious to know who is on the other side of the door, but the chapter ends there. The reader must read a chapter of Amy's Diary before finding out who is knocking on the door.<br /><br />Most of the members did not like the ending and felt they were left hanging. The ending made cause for the members to wonder if there will be a sequel.<br /><br />The twists and turns were very clever. The club felt that Amy was devious, manipulative and crazy and  Nick had his set of character flaws but in the end they deserved each other.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Last evening, there was lots of discussion on this book so we will give it 5 stars.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's been a while since having my daily devotional, even longer since attending church, but this app is getting me back on track.<br /><br />You will quickly appreciate the remarkable convenience of receiving a daily passage of scripture, displayed on schedule.<br /><br />It's nice when at work, having a rough day then all of a sudden my phone will play that familiar notification and I will spend a couple of minutes being reminded of my loving Savior and what is truly important.<br /><br />Besides the passages, this app offers a ridiculous number of devotionals and schedules to help you read through the whole Bible or your testament of choice. I highly recommend the New Testament, there a few good things in there ;-)<br /><br />Not to mention they offer any and every version of the Bible imaginable so you will be comfortable reading it whether you prefer NIV, KJV or any one of the myriad of other options available.<br /><br />Do yourself a HUGE favor by grabbing this wonderful app and notice how even after a few days the degree to which it helps to keep you on track and closer to Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it, wonderful, intriging, keeps you interested; has a wonderful story to it.  One of the best books I've read in years.
B003EVFHYG|4.0|Overall this soundtrack is definitely worth owning.  Several of the songs are downright amazing (Test Drive, Forbidden Friendship). Even the less flashy tracks are musical enough that you can sit through the whole thing without feeling like some tracks are meant strictly to match activities in the movie and therefore are sort of lacklustre.  I was interested in buying the whole thing based on the \\"menu screen\\" music on the DVD and would put this on par with the Avatar soundtrack.
B000WCDI64|5.0|I love Amy and consider this concert one of her best. You see her talent, enjoy the music, enjoy her silliness and there is a lot more about her life, family, etc. This is a must have!

B007GCY8FS|1.0|Like many other reviewers I had pre-ordered and eagerly anticipated the latest 'Jack Reacher' installment.  The best I can say is that it is disappointing, the worst - awful.  Lee Child lost his game or let someone else ghost write.<br /><br />Reacher is in Nebraska looking to get to Virginia.  So he does what he always does - he sticks out his thumb.  He gets picked up by two men and a woman, all dressed alike.  The journey begins... and the journey is boring, I felt like the proverbial child, 'are we there yet?'  Too much straight Midwestern road, not enough plot.<br /><br />Child has always written Reacher as a cerebral man but the 'one step ahead of the bad guys' thinking becomes too convenient - he can't always be right.  The bad guys are cliches and the good guys are one dimensional.  The book ends abruptly without a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />It must be difficult to continually write a series about a man without home or hearth and no connection to anyone.  Maybe Child is out of ideas - he should have skipped this one.
0345803485|2.0|I am struggling to get past book one. Honestly, the only time I think of reading it is when I'm bored at work. It's poorly written, has grammatical and punctuation errors, and the author writes like she has very little imagination. There are several parts of the book that probably could have been better if the author had elaborated a bit more. The story line is not that bad, but this is probably the worst book I've ever read because of the author's writing style and word choices. I'm gonna keep reading only because I'm interested in how the story ends. If you want to read this book to pass time, go for it... but don't buy it, borrow it like I did and save your hard-earned money. It's not worth the hype!!!
B002BEJ3BK|5.0|listen to the album start to finish that's the only way to do it!!! It is one of the best rap albums I have ever heard
B008MG1E4A|5.0|By that I mean no easy book to write.  Lots of controversy before it came out with good reason.<br />I got a good picture of how it went down and some good history on past SEAL missions.  I don't feel any secrets were let out.  He didn't talk about the modified Black Hawk.<br />I saw the book's author on 60 Minutes right after it was released.  He seemed like a decent person, willing to die for his country. When asked how his teammates felt about it he said they all support him.  I find that hard to believe since all SEALs take an oath not reveal any details of any of the missions they went on. I believe in the oath, just like when we took the oath to defend and protect against all enemies...<br /><br />I understand he was giving most of the money to charities.<br />I would have told it after a few in a bar maybe, but out in public as a book for the world to read?  If I'd heard it in a bar I probably wouldn't remember as much.<br /><br />He was in the Black Hawk that crashed and still managed to give UBL a tap. Good read as only someone on the mission could tell it.<br /><br />PS Diagrams at the back of the Kindle are too small to make out.
B00005KAQP|5.0|Sister Act is absolutely hilarious; I couldn't stop laughing! Not only is there an abundance of very funny humor, the plot keeps moving along and that held my attention really well. The musical score with that magical touch of Marc Shaiman greatly enhances the film; I also liked the choreography and the cinematography. The acting was very convincing, too!<br /><br />When the film starts, we meet the lead singer of a going-nowhere-fast group singing at The Nevada Club in Reno, Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg). Unfortunately for Deloris, her troubles don't end there. She is romantically mixed up with mobster Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel), who won't leave his wife for Deloris despite all his promises to do so. Deloris gets a purple mink coat from Vince; but when it turns out to be his wife's coat; Deloris is angry and she wants to return the coat to Vince at once. But just as Deloris arrives at Vince's office upstairs at the club, she witnesses a hit by Joey (Robert Miranda) and Willy (Richard Portnow), two of Vince's \\"assistants.\\" Vince now knows Deloris has to be killed too so she will never be able to testify against him in court--and therefore he will escape prison.<br /><br />Deloris goes to the cops in the nick of time; Lt. Eddie Souther (Bill Nunn) places her in a type of witness protection program where Eddie thinks Vince and his gang will never look for her--in a San Francisco convent where the nuns are never allowed out because of the extremely strict rules set by The Mother Superior (Maggie Smith). Deloris must also assume the name of Sister Mary Clarence so the other nuns won't know she's really a lounge singer hiding from danger until she can testify and go free again. Eddie hopes to get Deloris out in a month or two tops so she can testify against Vince and then be a free woman once again; but of course Deloris hates every minute of it and right from the start she clashes big time with The Mother Superior.<br /><br />How everything plays out is the focus of the remainder of the film; suffice it to say that things do take a turn for the better when The Mother Superior assigns Deloris to the choir; she really molds them into a fantastic choir at that! There's plenty of action and even some suspense, too.<br /><br />Look for performances by Kathy Najimy as Sister Mary Patrick; Wendy Makkena as Sister Mary Robert; Mary Wickes as Sister Mary Lazarus; Joseph Maher as Bishop O'Hara and Guy Boyd as Detective Tate. Isis Carmen Jones has a brief cameo as a very young Deloris in Catholic School many years prior to all the action.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a making of featurette and two music videos.<br /><br />Sister Act is a great choice for people who love classic comedy; this film is as funny today as it was when it was originally released! In addition, fans of the actors in this movie would do well to get this for their collections.ocus of the remainder of the film; suffice it to say that things do take a turn for the better when The Mother Superior assigns Deloris to the choir; she really molds them into a fantastic choir at that!

030758836X|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best thrillers/suspense novels I have ever read.  It has two of the most interesting and chilling characters ever created.  The book plays with your mind with twists that you will never see coming.  It is an absolutely \\"amazing\\" read (and I use the word \\"amazing\\" as a special word of praise to Gillian Flynn - you'll see what I mean if you read the book!).  BTW, some reviewers thought the ending was disappointing; however, I think it ended the only way it could, and it was stunning.  Kudos Ms. Flynn!

B0091ICDHU|4.0|This book was well written and although it was pitched at a young adult audience, it covered an issue that was fascinating from other perspectives. To hear the story through the voice of two youngsters (an 18 and 21 year old) didn't detract from its tight and compelling plot.

1451629192|5.0|I felt like I was there. Jaycee was a child who never got to grow up and develop normally. She had to face numerable horrors and yet survived them. I couldn't help but appreciate her child-like naivety as she wrote about the cats and having children while she was still a child. I think this book is a great example of how a victim of stockholm syndrome creates a reality where what they are dealing with isn't so bad. I cringed when Jaycee told of finally being allowed to leave - to go get her nails done - and yet it doesn't occur to her that Philip may be abusing their children. It also doesn't occur to her to leave.<br /><br />I felt just as confused by Nancy as Jaycee does. What a strange woman. Philip's predatory and criminal ways seem predictable, as horrific as they are. But Nancy remains a mystery.

B0084A9CA2|5.0|I read Siddhartha during College and it was in a Western Civilization Course. At the time I too was looking for something to help me as I grew into Manhood. The book always stayed with me as I went from one stage to another. I just recently re-read the story and once again I could relate to the stages of Siddhartha but with a more mature and older concept. This Amazon purchase was quick and easy and it was still a great read.

B000002KCC|1.0|He really captured the abysmal feelings of bereavement that caused him and the band to remain so drunk, so drugged that they couldn't play in time, or sing on pitch or give any evidence that they cared. Fine for them; work it out however you have to. But why a listener should have to pay for such indulgence is beyond me. Young is not afraid to record mistakes nor to release them. But music fans shouldn't have to pay for them unless they are the most ardent collectors or Young fans.

0061122416|3.0|The Alchemist may not be a perfect book, but it is a decent fable that all readers can relate to at some level. However, it also suffers from its fair share of issues, which often harm the story and disengage readers.<br /><br />First of all, when reading this book, one must approach it not as a fantasy, or any old fictional book. The Alchemist is purely a fable, a story of magic, improbability, spiritual elements, morals, beliefs, and happy endings. It is a fairly short novel, but Coelho effectively transfers basic, yet important morals like \\"never give up on your dreams\\" in the space it is allotted. Mainly, this is done through the protagonist, an (approximately) eighteen year old boy named Santiago who strives in his journey to accomplish his dreams, while also making several mistakes along the way. Coelho uses this familiar character to draw the reader in, and explain many morals through mistakes he had made, or experiences he had, eventually building up to the happy ending that we all knew was going to arrive. Coelho also does this through religious inclusion, quoting the Koran, bringing up Christianity, all done to add another point of familiarity to the story. All of these methods tie together to make a wonderful fable, a large world of improbability, wonder, and possibly even spiritual intrigue, even in the simplest of areas, that may make you stop and think for a moment, whether or not you agree with them.<br /><br />However, the positive aspects mostly end there. By continually bringing up morals and various spiritual beliefs through an overly-simplified writing style (most likely due to losses in translation), many readers may feel pushed away, like Coelho is purposely (and obviously) lecturing them. The book's basic and general morals also make for a thin plot, with many overly predictable events, and characters that may seem relatable in some aspects, but are largely flat and simplified in others. Many of Santiago's decisions are simply unplanned and uninformed, but they are done for the sake of the advancement of morals and plot, and seem strange an unrealistic by modern standards.<br /><br />In conclusion, Coelho's story isn't perfect. No story is. It suffers from many common ailments of simpler fables, such as simplistic and predictable plots based around general morals. It is still a fairly short read however, and accomplishes the requirements of a fable nicely. I would definitely recommend this book to others, but more as a quick read that may offer simple, yet influential and relatable ideas.
0385344333|1.0|It's with a heavy  heart that I have to write this review.  Before we start, as you can tell from my name, Reacher Creature, that I'm a huge fan of Lee Child and Jack Reacher. I had this day circled on the calendar, and pre-ordered it.  I just can't believe that Lee Child wrote this clunker. Okay, let's just get this over with.  This is a horrible book.<br /><br />Reacher is hitchhiking and he only wanted to get to Virginia. He gets a ride, but then soon realizes that things aren't what they seem. Reacher was only picked up as a decoy to help get people through a couple of police check points. As always, Reacher is nobody's pawn, and wants to get to the bottom of things, and make the bad guys pay with the justice only Reacher can dish out.<br /><br />There are so many things wrong with this clunker:<br /><br />1) Things are repetitive. Here is an example. Reacher makes a 9-1-1 call. The 9-1-1 goes through a \\"chain of command\\" four or five times, and we get to hear the call each time. Then when the right person gets the call, we hear it again, then the person goes through it sentence by sentence and analyzes each line.  It's painful to read over and over and over.  Another character had a conversation with Reacher, and plays it over and over, line by line, picking it apart, word by word.  It's brutal.<br /><br />2) So many long and pointless scenes That are drawn out. As the reader, we're treated to an entire chapter of the following: a) Someone looking for a car.  b) Someone walking up a driveway. Mind you, those aren't in the same chapter, *each* of them is a long and tedious chapter.  It is so pointless, boring, and a waste of time.<br /><br />3)Too much time in the car.  Reacher and his travel mates spend way, way, way to much time in the car. It's tedious and boring.<br /><br />4) There's no movement of the plot.  The plot is one major flatline. When we read, we expect the plot to move at an even pace, and all of the scenes have to build up on each other, like a flight of stairs. That doesn't happen.  This is a very long and a very boring read.<br /><br />5) The characters. The characters are flat, including Reacher. Honestly, all of the characters are boring and interchangeable. They have no substance or quality to them.<br /><br />6). Reacher threatens a child. This is horrible! Never would I even think Reacher would threaten a child.<br /><br />I think that one of two things happened with this book. 1) Lee Child never wrote this. If someone told me that he turned over notes and chapter outlines, like James Patterson does, then I'd believe them. 2) If Lee Child did write this, then he didn't give his best effort, and he's  a sell out. He's just interested in making money, and not making a good quality story, like he has in the past. If this is the case, then it's a slap in the face to the fans.<br /><br />I have heard that Lee was giving some thoughts on how and when he would end the series. If he's even thinking that way, then it's time to end it.  I didn't like The Affair, and gave him a pass on it. However, I can't this time around.  If he's thinking about ending this series, then he needs to do it now, before it's too late, and it already might be to late.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I'll  never buy another Lee Child book again. I'll get them at at the library, but never again will I spend my money on the books, I've been burned twice.  As the saying goes, \\"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.\\" Indeed, shame on me. It's a mistake I won't be making again.<br /><br />Honestly, this book is a waste of time. If you have to get it, then get it at the library. It honestly kills me to say that about a Reacher book.flight of stairs. That doesn't happen.

Gloria Swanson nailed this role to a \\"T\\" as an old, yet once famous, movie star who is a legend in her own mind while intending on making her grand come-back on the big screen. It is in black and white which makes it even more weird and dark yet classic. Carol Burnett did a skit based on the ending of this movie that was hysterical.  It's a very interesting plot based around her \\"house-guest\\"...whom she allows to stay at her house which quickly becomes a mutual understanding relationship.  The movie is based on the narrative of the \\"house-guest\\" and keeps you guessing to the end.  I wont say anymore...other than..I love this movie!
0894803123|1.0|My granddaughter received a wonderful Kitchen Aid ice cream maker for her birthday.  I ordered the Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream recipe book to go with the ice cream maker.  I prepared the recipe for chocolate ice cream.  We froze the ice cream maker bowl, poured in the chilled batter and it did not turn into ice cream.  We thought we might have to return the ice cream maker.  I suggested using a recipe in the Kitchen Aid booklet that came with the ice cream maker.  Bingo.  Delicious ice cream.  We'll give the Ben and Jerry's book another try, and hope that the problem is with the one recipe and all the others make wonderful Ben and Jerry's-like ice cream.

B008XG1X18|5.0|wonderful website. it has opened up a whole new world of great ideas for me along with a ton of new knowledge. thank you!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Great Music but don't waste your money on the \\"Limited Edition\\" All you get for the extra $7.00<br />is a cheesy booklet.Not even glossy photos.<br />Buy the basic CD. If you like Dylan you will like it.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My husband had this on his kindle fire and suggested it to me. I got it and really like it. For a free game it is pretty good. It reminds of old Atari games which I like.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Package came as promised and ahead of schedule.  Great series.  Every episode is better than the last and each keeps you glued to your seats.  Its a mix between the grittyness of HBO's The Wire and NBC's Law and Order, SVU.  Great show.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I chose this scanner after reading the reviews on Amazon. It works exceptionally well. I have used it for both scanning slides and negatives and have had no problems whatsoever. I have been satisified with the quality of the pictures. For me it has been an affordable way to save all of my old family pictures in digital media. I would highly recommend this product. The quality of the scanned pictures is better than I anticipated. Just keep in mind that the quality of the pictures you get depends on the quality of the slides you are scanning. This is not a high-end editing device. All in all the scanner does everything it is advertised to do.
B001PP9ALY|5.0|Angelina is again the best!I loved this movie it kept me interested all the way through. She is an awesome actress and I love all her movies
B0013O123Q|4.0|Definitely a movie to watch at least twice to catch all the plot details. I don't want to give away too much to anyone who hasn't seen this yet, but the first half is the most disturbing part. I hadn't seen it before, but knew about the most controversial scene. And it is indeed a hard watch-probably more so if you're not aware of what's going to happen. The way the film is structured, you know the scene is coming next, but you're still not prepared for a very brutal depiction of what happens. The end is a bit confusing as far as the overall timeline. I disagree with the Wikipedia entry, and think the final two scenes happen after the rest of the movie, but that's just my unproven opinion. The camera work is a bit disorienting at times, especially in the other violent scene, but it adds to an overall unforgettable experience. Highly recommended.
B000059QYB|5.0|Awe, Billy Idol, one of my favorite singers from the 80's. All the greats are in this CD and I enjoy his sounds.
0345803493|5.0|This book continues the story of fifty shades. I read the first because my wife had heard about it on the television and wondered about it. They are not my usual reading material, however, after the first one I was hooked on how the story would continue and end. This is a very well written book and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good read. I am now almost through with the third book and it has been just as good as the first two books.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Interesting to read it from a kids point of view. ending was a bit dragged out, but enjoyed it nonetheless.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|clever and simple controls make this instantly easy to play but very hard to master.  plays perfectly on my Xoom and responds very quickly.  I don't know why some people are complaining that it is impossible to get past a certain point.  I have gotten consistently higher scores and am now up to 4500+.  I also don't think it needs a &quot;save&quot; feature as that would miss the challenge of the game.  well done!
B005LAIGW8|2.0|I know the first movie was not well liked,but i enjoyed it.After watching this movie i liked it even more.This movie is a mess.Nicholas Cage is even more over the top than usual.The Ghost Rider cgi makes him look like hes smoldering,not on fire.Theres cutscenes when the Rider uses his powers and the background is black that look horrible.Check it out at your own risk YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!

B003Y5H5EW|4.0|As far as the quality,the disc and case were in good condition.The only physical problem was the case was a little warped.The movie is my favorite of the franchise.The original is a close 2nd to this one.Its filled with action and the story isnt complicated,its just a fun movie to watch.Must see if your a fan of the franchise.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Works great, love the different versions offered definitely worth having a pocket version handy at a moments notice, great app
B008LZHA3G|5.0|There's a saying in (some circles of) Nashville: \\"There's only Dylan\\"<br />BD has done it again ....(cigar in hand,indeed!) ...the whole album is slow sweet smoke from an aged, seasoned, quality crop. And it is an album of great worth. Dylan speaks his heart - but it is not mindless - Dylan is and has always been an honest commentator. A lot of his imagery comes from the Bible). He writes about \\"Soon After Midnight\\", love, about the world, about the past and how to pay for it, about what's coming, about the \\"Narrow Way\\" and about \\"Long and Wasted Years\\"...to hear musical prowess and cool licks you go somewhere else, but if you're looking for substance, there's only Dylan.
030758836X|4.0|Like other reviewers here - I loved every moment until the end. I thought the writing was excellent - the plot twists, character development, everything was five star - but the ending left me wanting/needing something more...or different. I'm not sure how I would have wanted it to end, but I wasn't happy with what was there. I am however interested in reading some of the author's other work. I really like her writing and narrative style.
B008602KQI|2.0|Movie did not reach expectation based on novel. Lead actors were ok, but plot wasn't well established.  Character interaction was weak.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great. It is always ready to help me out on a bad day. They have put a lot of good stuff into this with the plans, versions and the search ability. I really enjoy this app and the verse of the day widget. Thanks.
B003MX6QPU|4.0|This is probably one of the better romantic comedies i've seen in a while..oh but wait is it a romantic comedy!?! Watch and you will see why i ask. If you love or Like Deschanel I think u can agree with me, this is one of her best films.  Other good performances  Joseph Levitt was amazing in his role.  The sky is the limit for Joseph Gordon-Levitt he will continue to get better roles and i think he will become a box office success!
B006H5120E|5.0|Watching this film on my 120\\" 3D projection home theater was faaarrr better than the experience I had when I originally saw the film in theaters years ago. The detail and depth was just amazing. The subtle sound design and overall spectacle was wonderful.<br /><br />It's a film I'm going put on to show off to friends who stop over from now on.<br /><br />The one oddity is that the 3D version of the film is broken up into two discs and when the first one ends, the screen goes black and my machine locks up. I had to unplug my player and put it back in to get the disc out.<br /><br />I've yet to go through the hours of extras and commentaries, but my money was well spent with the film alone. Thank you.
B008MEM24S|5.0|love it! amazing game. so addicting and fun...totally worth the. 99 cents! Easy enough controls that my three year old can play the early levels and challenging enough that ive spent some time being stumped on other levels.<br /><br />Update: So excited to see an update with Dr D. but.....I keep getting an error that wont let me purchase this!! Amazon please fix this error!!!!
0061684384|5.0|I bought this book because I love Kat and her artwork. I wanted inspiration and ideas for my next tattoo. This book gives you her inspiration behind her own tattoos and others she's tattooed. It has a ton of pictures of her own tattoos and people she has tattooed. You won't be disappointed with this.
0345803485|1.0|So, my lovely wife, who thinks I can write (I can't!) thought I should read 50 Shades so I could see what is popular and perhaps move my writing more in that direction.  Fortunately for my ego, she had not actually read this festering pile before I obtained it.  Let me say that one of the reasons that she thought I should read this is that I do occasionally try my pen at some erotica, which she finds interesting, but not feminine enough (true).  I say to underscore that I am not shocked or scared away by the prurient content that allegedly exists in this book.<br /><br />I could repeat much of what the real (that is to say, one-star) reviewers have already pointed out, the lack of characters, the lack of plot, the lack of grammar, lack of anything remotely believable, lack of a spellchecker, lack of an editor, lack of checking even Google maps, oh and the complete lack of erotic writing.<br /><br />Don't believe me on that last one?  At one point Ana compares her orgasm to the spin cycle of a washing machine.  OMG, that's hot!  Jeez.  Which we Americans generally spell with a \\"g.\\"  Not that American writers use that word in print very often.  I would venture to guess that the word \\"jeez\\" shows up more in this book than all published American writing for the past 50 years.  But I digress.<br /><br />For an actual review, you can't do any better than to quote Dorothy Parker, \\"Tonstant Weader fwowed up.\\"<br /><br />The only bright spot is that I got this from the library, so at least I didn't directly pay for it.  To paraphrase Paul Simon, \\"There must be at least 50 ways to delete this from my kindle.\\"  And I am going to use all of them -- immediately!
0143119680|3.0|I started this book, thinking that it sounded fun & exciting.  On page 348, I told my husband that I still wasn't sure what it was all about and I hadn't really found any sustainable excitement.  There had been some excitement, but only for a couple of pages, then the book went back to being monotonous.  There were just so many details and descriptions of everything that it was taking forever to read. For the first time, I actually contemplated not finishing a book that I had started. However, a couple of chapters after that, things finally started to pick up and the book finally became the page turner I was hoping for. I think that there is such great potential for this book, but it really gets weighed down in all the 'needless to the plot' descriptions & historical references.  Sometimes, historical references can create some intrigue & relatability, ie Davinci Code.  But these references are just more of the muck. Unfortunately, I read the reviews for the next book in the series, and a reviewer indicated that the first twenty chapters were the same....I'm going to really have to motivate myself to read the whole trilogy.
0547564651|5.0|My husband is a public school teacher.  Every few years the district adopts some new \\"program\\" that is supposed to boost student learning and improve test scores.  What my husband has seen over the years is a constant dumbing down of the curriculum - and no better student performance.  In fact, performamce is sliding.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Do kids need more hours at school?  Year-round school?  Better technology?  Earlier introduction to reading?<br /><br />This author answers all of these questions and more with the most up-to-date research and a resounding NO.  Who succeeds in school and goes on to live a productive adult life?  Kids with grit, curiosity, determination, whose earliest years were a time of safety and attachment to mom.<br /><br />You'd think this was some fundamentalist Christian book but it is not.  This is a secular book about secular schools and research by secular social scientists.<br /><br />The author does not create a \\"how to\\" for helping failing kids and failing schools.  He simply discusses what works and what does not.<br /><br />Eye-opening, important book.  I would highly recommend this book to school district officials, school board members, teachers, administrators, and most of all PARENTS.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I got this product about 2 days before the estimated arrival date and it goes without saying that i was pretty excited about playing with this marvelous toy. First off the UV pen nib fits better than the black ink nib so i keep the UV on it at all times. Secondly its not as loud as i would have liked it to be, so if there is any background noise chances are you can barely hear it. Thirdly its a bit light and doesnt feel very durable but its just a minor offset to everything else this thing can do. Overall I would say this is a great product and I strongly recommend it for any whovian.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Looks good.  I dislike most sound effects so I turned sound off.  Plays smoothly.  I wish for some kind of narrative in which the strategy is explained.  Ciould not figure how to castle.  Overall very satsfied
B008NA3I30|3.0|You may like it or just hate it. Whatever your reaction to \\"Take This Waltz\\" may be, you will admit one thing: three-time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams's great acting skills. It seems she has been doing \\"serious\\" movies these days - remember she was in a comedy \\"Dick\\"? - and \\"Take This Waltz\\" is no exception, a romantic story with serious themes including boredom in marriage and life. That's fine with me, but as to Sarah Polley's sophomore effort as director, I think something is not right with the film. Or, in short, I was not convinced.<br /><br />Michelle Williams is Margot, a happily married woman writing for travel brochures. Her husband is Lou (Seth Rogen) writing a book about chicken recipes. While travelling abroad, Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby), an aspiring young artist, who happens to be living across the street. Now you know the rest of the story.<br /><br />Michelle Williams's emotional acting, in itself impeccable, is somewhat at odds with Sarah Polley's direction that tends to be too smart. Some of the dialogues and scenes are self-conscious of their importance, attempting so hard to serve as a metaphor or a clue as to what is going on in and around the characters, such as Margot's remarks about being \\"afraid of plane connections\\" or Daniel's muscular body when driving a rickshaw. In one scene the camera keeps going around two characters in a room, symbolizing the lapse of time (and perhaps their inability to move on). Some people would find these things thoughtful and intelligent. I think they are just pretentious.<br /><br />I see the point the director is trying to make, but in spite of (or perhaps because of) the stunning performances from Michelle Williams (the opening sequence alone is enough to prove her talent), the film looks artificial and unnatural. The film is often very emotional, to be sure, but the emotions come from her superb acting.<br /><br />Some films are called a \\"character study.\\" \\"Take This Waltz\\" is a study of emotion, andas such it is fascinating, perfectly capturing various phases of love. Strip away the veneer of emotions, however, and what you get is an oft-told story centering on one-dimensional characters set in implausible situations.

B005IQZB14|4.0|An extremely readable and inspiring book.  I found it to be a page turner.  No, I have no desire to hike the Pacific Crest Trial, but I found the authors journey fascinating.  We could all push ourselves a little more to take on an adventure or task that we thought we could not accomplish and find out more about ourselves in the process.

078324228X|4.0|Rubin Carter (Denzel Washington) was on the rise in life. He was the top ranked middle weight fighter in the world and considered to be on his way to the next champ. His fighting style leads him to earn the nickname Hurricane. The film opens in 1963 as Rubin fights Emile Griffith, the welterweight champion of the world, and Rubin wins in the first round.<br /><br />Rubin is convicted for a three times life sentence for a triple murder where the victims were shot to death. Rubin wasn't even in the club the night of the murders but he and a friend were stopped as the police were looking for two Negroes in a white car. They are taken to the local hospital. A dying man only half conscious was asked if he could identify Rubin and his friend. Rubin knows the police and one of them hates Rubin and wants to pin the charges on him...<br /><br />This is based on a true story about a man who claimed to be innocent. Worse yet it was the testimony of one of the murder suspects that put him into jail. Rubin had a reputation of being a trouble maker even when he was young. He was arrested as a child for stabbing a man who was trying to molest a friend and trying to throw Rubin down into the falls. His record followed him throughout his life. He was sentenced to a boy's home until he was 21 years old.<br /><br />Denzel Washington does a great job in this movie portraying Rubin Carter. It is a story of a possibly innocent man who served 20 years in prison while in the peak of his life and boxing career. It is a good movie and it is one you should watch. The movie is great but the story is twisted from the truth and the real life facts don't match the movie's twist in the truth of the real facts about Rubin Carter. Watch the movie for entertainment but if you want to be informed look into the history of Rubin Carter. Was he guilty, nobody knows but Rubin?<br /><br />Denzel Washington deserved an Oscar for his role in the movie and he makes it worth viewing. I recommend it to you.
B0094U0RJQ|1.0|I am a big Bob Dylan fan, but Mr. Dylan is living off his name and a great career.  He can't sing anymore.  His voice is beyond being shot.  He was one of the greatest writers of all time. Blood on the Tracks and Desire are priceless releases.<br /><br />Thanks for the great music Bob, but that was years and years ago.
6305657947|5.0|Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) spends his time at the museum staring at paintings at lunch. He is a wealthy businessman who has everything and life is just a repetitive bore. To jazz up his life he puts his intellect to crime and plans to steal a painting worth over $100 million dollars.<br /><br />This is a modern day big heist story where the crime is covered up by another crime. A beautiful and brilliant insurance investigator, Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), is helping to investigate the crime and she begins to suspect Crown....<br /><br />This is a good movie with a solid story line and a good cast. This film is a first class movie with an intelligent script and Pierce plays a bored rich man perfectly. It's a crime story that turns into a love story. I believe it is a very good movie, worth watching and I recommend it to you.

B005LAJ212|4.0|Thanks to ABC Studios, \\"Revenge: The Complete First Season\\" is now out in a five-disc DVD set. All 22 episodes are here for those who missed the show in its initial run. However, make sure you don't start watching it before blocking off a solid 16 hours to get through it all. You won't be able to tear your eyes off the screen once it starts.<br /><br />Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) returns to the Hamptons after spending several years in juvenile detention. As soon as she arrives, Emily sets out on a mission to exact sweet revenge on those who tore her family apart. She'll stop at nothing to expose the people who framed her father for a crime he didn't commit. Her biggest target is the powerfully rich queen of the Hamptons, Victoria Grayson (Madeleine Stowe) and her husband (Henry Czerny).<br /><br />\\"Revenge\\" is one of those shows you watch and when it's over groan and wish it could be two longer. I can never get enough of it. Just when you think you have something figured out writers go and change all the rules of the game again.<br /><br />The best way to describe the show is as \\"The Punisher\\" meets \\"La Femme Nikita.\\" Emily Thorne isn't a government agent, but she's just as resourceful and ingenious. After the first episode, you find yourself wiping the sweat off your forehead in relief that you'll never have a chance to cross her. She wants retribution for the death of her father. Anyone who was involved is going to suffer horribly.<br /><br />Each of the five discs contains bonus material. They include commentary for the pilot episode by creator Mike Kelley and actor Emily VanCamp, featurettes such as \\"Nolan Ross Exposed,\\" \\"Roadmap to 'Revenge,'\\" \\"At Home in the Hamptons,\\" and \\"Haute Hamptons: Femme Fatale Fashion.\\" There are also bloopers and many deleted scenes. Music videos for Christina Perri's \\"Distance\\" and Angus and Julia Stone's \\"For You\\" are featured as well.<br /><br />\\"Revenge: The Complete First Season\\" is only available in a regular DVD format now. I'm not entirely sure why ABC Studios went this way with \\"Revenge\\" but put out \\"Once Upon a Time\\" in both Blu-ray and DVD. I would think both shows would have enough demand to merit a high-definition transfer and release. If you haven't seen \\"Revenge\\" yet, here's your chance to get caught up before a new season starts.'m not entirely sure why ABC Studios went this way with \\"Revenge\\" but put out \\"Once Upon a Time\\" in both Blu-ray and DVD.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This is a great movie in my opinion. The actress does a wonderful job especially when trying to exude strength and a sense of calm, but having fear.
0385737955|5.0|This was a great read, definitely recommend. It started off a bit slow and the characters use alot of slang that came off as awkward for me at first, but you'll get used to it quickly. One thing I noticed about this book was there werent really any characters that i was annoyed with; usually theres at least one person who i wish would just shut up and die, happy to say this wasnt the case lol. The book picks up the pace early on and once the action starts its hard to put down. Lots suspense as the boys try to figure a way out of the glades, and this sort of reminded me of the hunger games arena in the respect that the characters knew they were being watched by the \\"creaters\\" and they were controlling the environment. The books ends with a cliffhanger that I didn't see coming, don't forget to read the epilogue!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Just purchased this book on my Kindle Saturday 9/8/12 finished it in three days. Very fast reading. At first I was a little disappointed how a SEAL who is sworn to secrecy could leak out information regarding classified info.But after reading Mark Owens book I'm ok with what he wrote this professional did not identify anyone and was very cautious too put out sensitive material. Funny how our GOVT can leak out info they feel they need to to get officials like Obama re-elected but a guy that puts his life on the line for the freedom we are provided is frowned upon. That is a joke and I'm glad this hero decided to tell his side of this story and I believe a man who puts his body in harms way over a coward like the president who couldn't even hold his end of the bargain of inviting the SEALS back to the White House for a beer. Shame on you Mr.President. When the Govt can follow the same rules our military people have to follow then I'll hold people like the SEALS to standards they must up hold as hired professionals to defend our freedom. 90 % of Mark Owens book had already been leaked out before this hit the newsstands. So stop criticizing a true american hero and hold politicians responsible for using soldiers blood shed on the battle field as chess pawns in a very risky game of gaining political capital to strengthen their resumes and re-election campaigns.
0385344333|4.0|To paraphrase Brendan Behan, \\"critics are like the eunuchs in a harem, they know how it's done but they are unequiped to do it themselves.\\" Don't give too much weight to the opinions of the reviews here, read the book and decide for yourself. I thought it delivered on everything I have come to expect from a Jack Reacher story.<br /><br />Speaking of expectations, every serious fan of these books should be offended by the casting of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher in Christopher McQuarrie's upcoming attempt to tell the story of \\"One Shot\\". Surely an actor of greater physical and intellectual stature could have been found to portray this iconic character. The incestuous relationship between Cruse and  McQuarrie threatens the investment in movie rights to Child's books. I hope Child got the money up front and can disassociate himself completely from the perversion of his story by \\"Hollywood\\".

(I'm waving my fist while saying that)<br />The album does perhaps  have a more laid back, striped down, roots feel to it compared to \\"Big Moon..\\" & makes for a extremely enjoyable listen.<br /> It is amazing how much Robinson's song writing & musicianship has evolved over these two albums & would be fascinating if he could reproduce it when back with the Crowes.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I am now enjoying this app; it took awhile to get it to work (not app problem, but G-Mail problem).  I update schedules on  the Kindle File, and my schedule is automatically updated on my phone.
1416511946|5.0|And probably never will be, but I think I just fell in love with Nikki Sixx! I just finished reading the Heroin Diaries, and I could easily turn back to the first page and start again. Two thumbs WAY up...
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I found it very difficult to connect to the lead characters. The other characters were entertaining and likable.  In all fairness I have never been a fan of over protectiveness in animals or people.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game, i was waiting for it on android for a long time, and finally it's here. It has all latest features as iOS version (gadgets) unlike some other games that have android version updated not so often. It misses maybe couple of grafic effects, but that doesn't spoiled my joy of finally seeing this game on android.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It's a fun little addictive game that helps pass the time. It's very challenging at some parts but not too much that my 8 and 7 year old can't play it.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I would recommend this movie and/or seller to anyone.  It was in perfect condition upon arrival and arrived on time. We watched the movie and it was wonderful. A must see for all ages!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|After seeing Phantom live, I didn't have high expectations for a recorded version.  I was wrong!  It was fabulous! It was just as engaging as watching it live.  The cast was wonderful and seeing Andrew Lloyd Weber and the original Phantom and Christine was delightful!
B005IKZ60G|5.0|Great music done in David Guettas unique and personal style, I enjoy every tune on this disc and reccomend it to anyone who likes dancce music.
B00198X0VS|5.0|The sound is loud, the quality is good. What else do you need from the movie! :-) Oh! The price is good too. I am satisfied.
B005C9YZKU|5.0|Everything looked great at first until I got deeper into the package. The plastic cube that the globe comes in says Blu-ray on it. The back of it where the description is says 1080p Blu-ray. When I opened the globe to check out the disks I was surprised to see the DVD logo. Every sleeve and disk was for the DVD version but was in the Blu-ray packaging. I'm sure this is just a mix up but upsets me all the same. I was very excited to get this and now will have to wait until Amazon sends a replacement. I'm sure the actual Blu-ray version is 5 stars but I felt that I should warn people to double check this just in case they are giving it for a gift. This is the only mix up I have had with Amazon in several years. I hope this is only a one time thing.<br /><br />EDIT: It is a couple of days later and I have the correct product. Amazon was excellent through the entire process. These look great on my 47 inch Vizio. Changed to 5 stars.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Though I'm about a three-star reviewer on the book, I have to give a five star for the CD.  I've always loved classical music that inspires and moves the soul. Since E.L. used this music as inspiration while writing the story, as well as mentioning the pieces in the book, I totally understand the influence music can play on an author during creation.  Even if you don't like the book, you'll probably enjoy the CD.  The musical choices are very moving and relaxing.  I've been listening to it for hours, and I'm not tired of it at all.  Nice choices, E.L. James. You mean to please.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can finally use pinterest on my kindle!! I'm really happy with this app.. and of course I spend hours using it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game. myself n my daughter but wish the games didn't cost so much to unlock another. if the cost to unlock other games was cheaper id have no issues with this game at all. its fun n my children love it too!
1612183956|3.0|I'll keep this short because so many other reviewers appear to have blown a drain plug over this book. (Are you guys practicing up to be Greg Iles?)<br />I can't imagine WHERE all that verbosity in all of those (equally unimaginable) five-star reviews came from.  I refuse to believe so many people are actually completely starved for reading material?<br />The big deal in this book is supposedly the heart-stopping surprise ending.  Well, it SHOULD be a surprise; you get not a single hint or clue to make you feel like you could unravel this mystery.  It felt as though the ending from an entirely different book was stuck on here in a quick cut & paste maneuver.  And the shenanigans that went before that bolt from left field were not easy to swallow either.<br />Did the waylayed victims ALL have to get hit by a Mack truck?  Come on!?!?!  I know they had an underground garage just chockablock full of vehicles of all descriptions but... get real!<br />And... a populace that can be roused from domestic torpor to murderous frenzy and shrieking lunacy by a single conference call?  It was like they had Papa John's Zombie Apocalypse on speed dial for quick delivery.<br />And why do you leave a brutally murdered Secret Service agent handcuffed to a bed in an abandoned house for someone to find?  More to the point, why do you even handcuff him to the bed at all given the demonstrated fast and effective killing techniques of your sociopathic mob violence?<br />I'll just stay away from the marauding, drooling, naked mountain lion wannabe clan. That was just goofy.<br />I said I'd keep this short, so that's it for the overblown, meandering, less than plausible storyline.  What about the writing? Oy!!!<br />First observation: take all that blather about Stephen King and Dean Koontz and X FIles and Twin Peaks and Twilight Zone and Hitchcock... and FORGET IT. A couple of the qualities that infuse the writings of King and Koontz and the visual storytelling of Hitchcock are timing and moderation.  They know/knew how to \\"build\\" a story, structure it, overlay it with imagery and suspense, detail and secrecy, pacing and tension. And all of those mentioned television efforts borrowed generously from that inventory. But of course it was a master craftsman who brought quality writing to fantasy TV.  Rod Serling was FIRST a wordsmith and THEN a pop culture vender. No such progression here. Beyond the five per cent of this book that is totally off the wall and a slap to the reader's blind side, the rest is equal parts predictable and impossible and is populated with cardboard cutout characters whose actions are unmotivated by the story and whose dialogue is unstimulated by rational thought. This book is one long chase scene that could have been over in ten minutes if even a single character hadn't been an overblown stereotype.<br />If you've read some others of my reviews, you know the disdain I hold for critics who compare one author to other, successful writers.  That hasn't changed.  I do it here only to refute the comparisons drawn by other reviews of this book.  Blake Crouch is no Stephen King.  He's not Dean Koonts.  He isn't even close.  There's much more to storytelling than simply telling a story.oderation.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. it keeps me entertained for hours. some games are simple and others require a little more brain power. I definitely recommend this app.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The sound track is relaxing and the puzzles are genuinely challenging. I got this as the free app off the day so the price was right. It's a great time waster.
B002ZHKZCO|1.0|I just received my copy today and it is missing it's 100th anniversary cover?  What's up with that?  If I just wanted the regular disk I would have ordered it (at the time it was cheaper than the 100th anniversary edition).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Truely heplful with devotions! There are plenty of amazingly easy devotion plans to choose from. I definitely give this app five stars!
B0088X7YU0|5.0|I will start by saying I have been a Heinlein fan for many years. I read the book and have seen all the Starship Trooper movies; as well as, the Roughnecks animated series. Overall, I rate this as a better than stand alone movie than the second and third live action movies.  This animated movie is not connected to the Roughneck series as I first thought. The movie picks up in the distant future after the first movie. I am not sure if the Writers even took in account of the second and third movie, which I don't blame them since they were not very good.<br />The story of a rescue team entering at space station to rescue Troopers as the bugs takes over. This is when you get to meet all of the new characters. Some of the Characters get a small back-story but most do not. Later, this combined team must recover a ship and discover why it was seemly abandoned. That is when the Bugs attack.<br />The CGI is better than of the Roughnecks, most likely due to emerging technology. The script is well written and the characters are unique. There are a lot of Characters to get straight in your head, but there are plenty of choices to become your favorite. There is also the return of some of your favorite characters from the original movie.<br />As a fan of Sci-Fi and Animation, this movie is one of my top favorites. It is defiantly not made for young kids, due to language and nudity in several scenes. The DVD has plenty of extras and defiantly worth the money.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I was iffy on whether to get this or not. I'm curious about it, who wouldn't be who was here for 9/11. I started reading though, and found myself bored. I just don't like the author's writing style. I skimmed through and tried to look at the pics, but their too hard to see on my phone, which is what I have my kindle on. I think it would be nice to have a copy of the paperback, to skim through, see how the operation happened, but its definitely not worth 12.99 on my kindle. No way. I wouldn't have a problem at 4 or 5, but 13 is just too much for what this is. Others will probably love it, but it was just bleh for me.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I knew this Series from MTV back in the 90's. It is a great series. The only disadvantage is that is they still working with the DVD Region Code. Why? This Series is from the 90's!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow.  Okay I'm a Christian and almost have never read anything but Christian fiction in the last 23 years. I could not put this book down.  I started it last night and finished it 24 hours later.  It was a cross between Survivor, Big Brother, 1984 (hated that book) and who knows what else.  This is not for faint hearted people for several reasons.  If you have a fear of fire or bees, don't read this. I found this story compelling and cannot understand the one 3 star rating that I did read.  What did you expect this girl to act like, living the life she lived?  How can any person exhibit any emotion when they are more than set in a survival mode?  I haven't seen the movie and I'm axious to see how well they stay in tune with the book. The setting was real, the emotions gribbing and I could easily picture the characters in the book.  Really good storyline and setting.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I ended up seeing this based on my niece's recommendation. She had gone to see it with her grandfather when it was out in theaters, and she loved it. Honestly, I was a little hesitant about this movie because I remember not being fond of the Dr. Seuss book when I was a kid. However, I'm glad I rented this movie. It was very cute and enjoyable. Definitely a great family movie!
B004G600A4|5.0|Loved the movie.  It was very uplifting and fun.  Would recommend it to anyone, old or young.  Movie arrived in great shape, even though it had been used.
1574241451|4.0|This book is pretty informative with lots of historical information about the guitar's history and development, variants, and users.  Too bad it isn't printed on glossy paper like the L5 book by the same author.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Hi Mike,<br /><br />About 5 weeks ago I bought the Shredded Chef and Bigger Leaner Stronger.  I've been working out for about 10 years with some progress here and there and just wanted to thank you for your perspective, which has allowed me to see some pretty great results in a short amount of time.  Since adopting your approach to training and nutrition, my strength has gone up, my strength between sets has remained consistent, and my overall energy levels have improved.  Specific changes I've made include: eating properly before lifting, warming-up using your recommended rep scheme, fewer exercises and sets per muscle group, and providing my body with the right nutrients after my workouts.  I've put on about 7 pounds in just 4 weeks without much noticeable gain in fat.  The only supplements I take are protein powder and a multi-vitamin, but with the progress I've made so far I'm not looking to add anything else.  Again, I'm not a newcomer to weight training by any means, so I'm pretty pleased with the results I've had so far in using your program.  I owe you a sincere 'thanks', because I was tired and frustrated with years without noticeable progress.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This was a hard book to put down.  It was a heartbreaking and a nail biting read.  I highly recommend. I just can't seem to get enough of Kathy Reich and her Bones series.  Love the TV series as well.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|sorry I was going to try this until I saw the list of permissions. talk about data mining. no thank you.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was a light read and kept me lauhging the entire time. Its a book that you can put down if you have to but you most likely won't want to. I would definitley be willing to read it again. If you're a fan of SNL 30 Rock or any other movie/show Tina Fey is in you will enjoy this book.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is one of my favorite books of all time, have probably read it a couple dozen times.<br /><br />Not only is this a great story that has a pace that keeps you engaged through the entire story, but the storyline also has so many themes twined together that just about anyone will find a way to relate to the characters. Ender is both a heroic and tragic character, a brilliant child bound for greatness, but at the same time a pawn of the adults who control his life (and even is birth itself).<br /><br />In many ways this book is a treatise on the belief that the end justifies the means. I would highly recommend this book as a subject for any book club who wants to have a lively discussion, even for those who do not like Sci-fi books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a very explicit book, but was done with taste. It had a great story about people from opposite ends of the social and economic plane. I was rooting for both of the lead players. Hoping true love could find common ground with each changing to form a permanent, more \\"normal\\" relationship.<br />I am anxious to read the next in the series and will continue to hope for a \\"Happy Ending\\".
B008XG1X18|1.0|you cant log in!!!!  issue needs to be resolved for kindle fire users.  last review had the same issue and its now September
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun. You do not have to buy game currency in louder to attain higher levels. strait forward and enjoyable.
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|Dylan delivers a home run with Tempest - appropriate given his penchant for playing in baseball fields these past few years.  Definitely 5 stars. I don't have time to write a full review at the moment, but I just want to take a moment to write that if you are THINKING about this purchase you really should go for it.  Great new songs, great lyrics, great atmosphere.  Why is Dylan still here?  Why is he still relevant?  Why go for another big payout (in his own words)?  This is a driven artist.  Like Picasso, Pablo Casals, Miles Davis... Dylan will be making his art until the day he dies.<br /><br />I'm not giving a track by track analysis, others have done already done a great job of that.  Scarlet Town is my favorite track.  It's like standing next to a beach fire on a cold windy night.  A very Tom Waits sort of thing.  I hate to make that comparison but it's the only one I can come up with to describe it.  Banjo played in a way I've not heard elsewhere.  It's a busy sound, like someone methodically trying to find their way through the dark while a violin laments.<br /><br />And since I'm out here anyway.  Dylan and his band are on tour right now and I saw him in Indianapolis a couple of weeks back.  Lay your dollars down and go.  This band is extremely hot, very polished.  I'm 57 and have been attending rock and jazz concerts since I was 14.  This is definitely one of the top three shows I've seen in my lifetime.  Go!<br /><br />\\"If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday\\"
B008GXHOFW|4.0|looks better when you turn brightness down a bit but really needs an up grade! overall good game but it could be great!
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Boardwalk Empire was most interesting and engaging.  It taught me a lot about the Depression Era and the Prohibition Era and the Women's Right to Vote! Music was fantastic and played many songs and dancing I remembered from the 1930's.
0394818237|5.0|Richard Scarry's books, especially this one were the absolute favorites of my son (and me) when he was growing up.  Nearly every night before going to bed we read something and most times it was this Scarry book.  I miss having my son plead, \\"Dad, Dad, let's read the \\"How People Do Book.\\"  These books and the original Winnie the Pooh books were major influences in my son learning to really read anything by the time he was three years old.  I thank Richard Scarry and A. A. Milne with instilling a life long love of books and reading in my son.  They must have had something to do with him becoming a Professor of Geology and Astronomy in the Bay Area.  Great book.  Too bad you can only buy the abridged version now.
0817439390|4.0|As a bit of a beginner in the world of photography I found this book a fantastic resource.  From technical \\"how to\\" to artistic insight this book is wonderful.  It's a bit \\"disjoint\\" at times, reading as though the author is talking to you rather than having composed everything ahead of time - but its insights are invaluable as an \\"old-timer\\" passing down wisdom to us youngin's.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|My husband bought me this for my kindle. Well I kind of asked him to. And buying books 1 and 2 is a big waste of my money and reading the books especially book 2 is a waste of my time. Poorly written. Anastasia Steele, very annoying and DUMB !!! He loves me... Boohoo... Yeah right. Christian loves only one thing and it's his \\"you know what\\"... I do not like stories with weak female character. I don't think I would want to continue reading the rest of book 2. Please tell me everything will change towards the end and Anastasia will wake up and realize how weak minded she is. Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey \\"Psycho's\\". This is by far the worst book I've ever read. It's very disappointing.....:(
B004SBQGHS|5.0|a awesome game with pigs and wood and bricks and ice and birds that crash a ton of stuff like everything I said.
0062206281|4.0|Nothing can match the complexity and sinister suspense of The Shadow of the Wind, but The Prisoner of Heaven is a worthy follow-up to that story. I liked this one better than The Angel's Game, which I found somewhat confusing and overwrought.<br /><br />Fermin Romero de Torres was my favorite character in The Shadow of the Wind(TSOTW), so I was delighted to discover that he takes center stage in this story. Remember in TSOTW when the boy Daniel meets Fermin, a pitiful, starving wraith in rags, prowling the streets of Barcelona? The Prisoner of Heaven takes us back to the years after the Spanish Civil War, where we learn how Fermin came to be that wretch Daniel found.<br /><br />Daniel Sempere is all grown up now, married, and the father of a little boy. One day a creepy stranger enters Sempere and Son bookshop and leaves a cryptic note for Fermin. Daniel is both curious and worried for Fermin's safety, so Fermin begins to tell him the story of his years as a prisoner in Montjuic Castle.<br /><br />If you loved Fermin and his salacious one-liners, you're in for a treat. You'll also love the way Zafon ties in characters and events from both TSOTW and The Angel's Game. We revisit Beatriz, Bernarda, David Martin, and the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. We even get to learn a little more about Daniel Sempere's mother, Isabella, who died when Daniel was small.<br /><br />I loved the sweet and subtle way the book ends. Loved it. It's a perfect completion of the circle begun with the opening of The Shadow of the Wind. Zafon brings us back to where our journey began, while leaving the door open for further adventures.
B007I1QUYE|4.0|Spiderman I, II, and III, were very entertaining and kept the grandkids entertained.  The entire family enjoyed the films, popcorn and drinks.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|As far as product: the Amazon video player, it played well, with only a couple of fuzzy scenes.<br />As far as the movie itself: there were a number of laugh out loud moments, a couple of very touching moments that brought a tear or two. The conversations between characters didn't seem pushed or contrived. The one thing that this movie had too much of and was not needed, was the foul language. The dialog and the intertwining lives of the characters was enough to carry the movie. The over use of foul language actually detracted from the film. Some movies are so poorly written that it seems the bad words are used as filler, to make it more funny or shocking in order to make up for or disguise a terrible film. It was just not needed in this one. Too bad.
1609611543|5.0|I purchased this book after hearing Bill O'Reilly talk about it and saying really great things about the book.<br /><br />The book is for my husband who reads it when he can.  So far, for the little he has read, he says it is GREAT!<br /><br />Once he is through with it, I plan on reading it myself.<br /><br />I think it is a book that everyone should read and if Bill O'Reilly says it is a must read and a great book that changed his life.....that is all I needed to hear as well as my husband.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I had to buy a replacement because  the outside covering of the cable fell off and caused damage to what ever was next to it. .<br />This cable is not  Kindle quality.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is such a cute movie to sit and watch.  The idea of switching your homes for a period of time and how it could change your life.  This movie will make you laugh an cry so you know it has to be good!
B004KKYX9K|5.0|Jodi Piccoult writes brilliantly. \\"Sing You Home\\", along with all of her other titles are wonderfully realistic, heat-warming stories about real life issues. I would recommend her books highly.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I found this book to be very entertaining.  I enjoyed the new mythology it presented.  A lovely way to pass some time without being too taxing.

B0015I2P0Y|5.0|This is the best cd I've purchased in a long time. It is gorgeous beyond words lyrically and musically. The song \\"One Day Like This\\" is worth the price of the cd alone.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have a Kindle but I can't always carry it with me.  I was really excited to see the kindle app on my phone.  I love that the color of the page and size of the font can be changed at will, and that I can lock the screen so I don't have to be annoyed by the screen flip flopping on me.  I can get my archived items easily and remove them as well.  The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't sync up with my kindle.  If I switch back and forth (which I often do) I have to figure out where I left off.  Otherwise it is fantastic!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer has been read more than two times by myself.  I love this book!  When a person reads this book it takes them back to the \\"old South\\" and the adventurous times that boys had when they were young.  I read this to my son when he was younger and he loved it.  He wanted to be able to do the things that Tom Sawyer was involved in - but I told him that was not able to because of the modern times we were in.  Even today, at the age of 68, I wouldn't mind reading this book again.
1476712042|5.0|i loved beautiful disaster! it has everything that you are looking for in a book. the main character are amazing! i love Travis. everyone should read this book!!!!!

B008KEQMDC|4.0|\\"I just wanted the glow. The one that they promise you on the cover of those magazines. Well, I'm calling it - pregnancy sucks. Making a human being is really hard. I have no control over my body or my emotions.\\" This is a movie based off the famous book and deals with five different couples and how they handle pregnancy ranging from problems trying to adopt to having a sickeningly easy time giving birth. This is yet another movie dealing with many different couples and relationship problems but this is one of the better ones. I have said before that I am not really a fan of this type of genre but I really enjoyed this movie and laughed throughout. It may be because I have a kid and went through the whole pregnancy thing with my wife but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I am also really shocked at my favorite movies of the last few weeks. I have really enjoyed \\"Think Like A Man\\" and \\"Five-Year Engagement\\" and once again I think this \\"chick-flick\\" is the best movie of the week. I am not sure what that says about me but there are some really funny parts in this and if you are a woman do not be afraid about bringing this home to your man, he may throw a fit at first but the comedy (and Cameron Diaz's opening dance scene) will keep him watching and he will also enjoy it. I know I did...the dance was amazing though. Overall, a surprisingly funny movie that really won me over and I thought that was great. I (again surprisingly) give this an A.
B000058983|4.0|I bought this because Danny Brown said it was his favorite album of all time and I wanted to see what it was like. Flower child music but it's cool
B008PE9GSA|4.0|I think this album has better songs than any album since Antenna, but not enough to make it worth a 9-year wait.  But still a good effort and I'm enjoying listening to it.  I will also say that the two bonus Best Buy songs are worth getting.
B00164CM46|4.0|I put people onto this movie all the time. I wish Guy Ritchie would make more stuff like this and Lock Stock
031620157X|3.0|The Land of Stories is a fun read filled with familiar fairy tale characters, but with a twist. I picked this book up from the library because I enjoy almost anything Little Brown publishes for middle readers and I am a fan of Glee. I liked reading this book- but it is definitely not a favorite, or one I feel I NEED to read to my kids someday.<br /><br />Chris Colfer has a fun premise, two twins who recently lost their father literally fall into the fairy tale world they grew up hearing about. I liked the twins, who are very opposite, and I liked some of the spin-offs found on familiar fairy tales like Goldie Locks the outlaw, and sleeping beauty, the queen who is still trying to put her kingdom back together.<br /><br />The reason for the lower rating is mainly because of the plot. While interesting, it isn't very complex at all. Alex and Conner need to gather rare objects to complete the wishing spell in order to return home. It's supposed to be a dangerous mission most fail, but it just seemed too easy to me. This may make it better for younger kids (like 7 or 8) but very flat for older audiences. The kids run into trouble, but before the tension has a chance to build, or before they fail and have to try another solution, for the most part everything just works out on the first try every time.<br /><br />There are some good themes in here, like dealing with loneliness, happily ever after isn't all it seems, and strong family bonds... but there are also some tricky ones too. One main theme is that villains are products of their environment, which makes sense, but certainly doesn't excuse bad behavior (which the author sort of does.) There is also a part where one twin cheats on a test for another in order to be a loving sister, but that hardly seems like something we want our kids doing. (I know, I am being way particular here, I just think because of the simplicity of writing along with the amusing but tension-free plot make this a younger book- some of the main points- like the world is not black and white are tougher to hit home with this same age group. So, I am glad I read it, I think Colfer will grow in his writing and shows promise, but it doesn't quite live up to the potential.points- like the world is not black and white are tougher to hit home with this same age group.

B0000009SY|5.0|In 1979, Frank Zappa did something he'd never done in his career, and also something few recording artists EVER had done, at all: He released five albums. It's a feat he would duplicate in 1981 and 1984, but this first time out was very, very impressive, given the consistent high quality of the recordings -- and the fact that two of the releases were double albums, making for SEVEN vinyl discs from FZ that year.<br /><br />He started in January with \\"Sleep Dirt.\\" Actually, this was one of the albums released without his permission. The whole story involves a twisted tale about his battle with his record company and his desire to release a four-LP set called \\"L&auml;ther.\\" Most of the material on \\"Dirt\\" was supposed to be part of the \\"L&auml;ther\\" project, but \\"Dirt\\" was a great album in its own right, featuring among other great cuts the instrumental warhorse, \\"The Ocean Is the Ultimate Solution.\\" Next up, in March, was \\"Sheik Yerbouti,\\" a two-disc set that managed to offend a lot of people, with songs such as \\"Jewish Princess\\" and \\"Bobby Brown Goes Down.\\" In May, FZ released \\"Orchestral Favorites,\\" which consisted of five instrumental songs, some of them quite long, especially the 13-minutes-plus \\"Bogus Pomp.\\"<br /><br />And then, in September and November respectively, came \\"Joe's Garage Act I\\" and the double-disc \\"Joe's Garage Acts II and III\\" -- altogether, three albums of instrumental and vocal material. \\"Joe's Garage\\" was a concept album, but not nearly as exalted or elevated as, say, The Who's \\"Tommy.\\" Instead, \\"Joe's Garage\\" was a raucous, wild set of songs existing as part of a pretty simple plot device: In the future, music itself is outlawed, and the \\"Central Scrutinizer\\" watches over all -- enforcing, in fact, laws that haven't even been passed yet! Definitely a figure straight out of George Orwell's \\"1984.\\"<br /><br />There were the usual, offensive Zappa blasts, such as \\"Crew Slut\\" and \\"Catholic Girls\\" and \\"Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?\\" But with the music itself, Zappa had hit a high point; across these three discs, the listener would hear doo-wop, blues rock, funk, and on and on, as Zappa effortlessly blended musical styles to support his twisted rock opera.<br /><br />FZ also scored one of the greatest songs of his career, the instrumental \\"Watermelon in Eastern Hay,\\" which listeners over the years -- including Zappa's son, Dweezil -- would declare as the best guitar solo Frank Zappa ever recorded. Certainly, it was emotionally effective, coming near the conclusion of the work, at which point Joe, exhausted from fighting the Scrutinizer and all he represents, imagines one final, impossibly beautiful, incredibly sad, amazingly poignant guitar solo. Even compared with all the great guitar solos he'd recorded previously -- the ones on \\"Rat Tomago,\\" \\"The Torture Never Stops\\" etc. -- \\"Watermelon in Eastern Hay\\" was Frank Zappa's masterpiece.<br /><br />Zappa in those days, though, wasn't just committed to making great music and offensive jokes. He was fighting people who would censor music and, he believed, help destroy freedom itself. He had heard about such goings-on in Iran, for example, which, during the Iranian Revolution of 1979, actually outlawed rock music. And by the mid-1980s, he would be fighting would-be censors in his own country, including the Parents' Music Resource Center. Eventually, he would testify before Congress about the perils of censorship.<br /><br />\\"Joe's Garage\\" stands up today as both a serious protest of such efforts and an outrageous, obnoxious, \\"in your face\\" to anyone who would dare try to muzzle people like Frank Zappa. It's also an incredibly listenable album. It didn't hurt that Zappa's collaborators included some of the best musicians in the business at the time, including keyboardists Peter Wolf and Tommy Mars and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta.

B008M34INW|3.0|This is an enjoyable time waster. Nice to see Mel Gibson trying to get past his troubles. Lacked the gratuitous nudity you expect from an R-rated movie but that is a small quibble.
0525953728|5.0|This book was so interesting to me that I couldn't resist reading it. Once I started reading, I hard trouble putting it down. Not only does it clear up the discrepancies and guesswork of the media reports about the Bin Laden raid, it paints a clear picture of the mission and almost makes you feel like you were there witnessing it. The book also gives you a peek into the lives of people who do those types of things for a living. It's hard to imagine that for some people, a normal day at the office includes kicking in doors, killing bad guys, and putting youe life on the line for a greater cause.

0345803485|1.0|I heard about 50 Shades of Grey awhile ago and well..<br />I heard only bad things. And I thought I need to check it out if people really think it is that bad. I thought maybe they were exaggerating.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they were not. I bought it in a local bookstore for ten bucks and started reading right away. Turned out the only thing I can do about it, is laughing.<br />That's the only thing. It's hilarious. No really.<br />You cannot connect to the characters in any way and you just loose the plot at some point. It's constantly repeating itself and Anas \\"inner goddess\\" is just ANNOYING. Reads like a 5th grader writes. I have the believe James never had sex before. Or never actually did the research on BDSM.<br />Isn't it supposed to be somehow exciting? I swear it's not.<br />I believe James had a second 50 Shades open next to the file she was originally working on and always copied that damn hard limits and soft limits lists in whenever they were talking about it.<br />It is in no way erotic or thrilling and it won't certainly possess you. Dear god no.<br />It will stay with you forever though.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey lays in my bathroom now and I read it whenever I am on toilet. I swear that's where these books belong.<br />Don't bother buy the other books.<br />It ain't worth it.<br />How did this kick off Hunger Games and Harry Potter!?<br />What is wrong with you 5starers?<br />I really wish I could summon Katniss and Harry to give that damn Ana a good kick.<br /><br />Amazon, please invent -Stars. I really wanna give this book a -5.

B007704PRU|5.0|**MAY CONTAIN SOME SORT OF SPOILERS**<br /><br />I loved this novel. It was quite simply amazing and the part at the end was a major cliffhanger leaving me wanting more!!! Its full of suspense, action and romance and the characters actually have their own, distinct personalities not like some stories Ive read before.<br /><br />The author has done an awesome job at writing both the first and second novel in this series, I'm not quite sure which one I like more. Although I must admit I'm on Team Alex :p<br /><br />Anyway, to sum the novel up, I really liked it because it refers to the present and the past, it shows how Lena grows stronger as the book progresses and I do like it how she isn't as cautious in the second novel as she was in the first. Also, the cliffhanger at the end is great because it leaves everyone waiting desperately for the next novel in the series. :)

B00447L4JG|5.0|Like many others, we have made this movie into a tradition. After the Halloween trick or treating is done, we settle down and watch TNBC. It creates a great transition between the two holidays.<br /><br />I think this is one of Danny Elfman's best movies. The Halloweentown songs are suitably creepy, but 'What's this?' has a very Christmassy feel of excitement. I love the use of color, too; appropriately gloomy for the Halloweentown sequences, but bright and cheerful for Christmastown. The story is original and the characters are memorable. There's a lot of humor, as you might expect, but some of the scenes might be frightening for younger children, so use some discretion as to what age you feel they can watch it without being too scared.<br /><br />A fun movie which repays watching over and over; there's always something new to see.

B0069UV0LS|4.0|Because of my work schedule, I sometimes have to watch a movie in two installments. I intended that to be the case here, but, I simply could not turn it off.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Joseph is an angry drunk on public aid. After a particularly bad bout with the bottle he finds himself hiding out in a used goods shop run by a very religious woman. She offers to pray for him. He'll have nothing to do with it, but after some while the two begin to trust one another and a relationship evolves.<br /><br />When I saw the description of this I thought I knew what was going to happen and didn't think I'd enjoy it. But it was directed by Paddy Considine who is a veteran actor so I thought I'd give it a go. I couldn't have been more wrong on the content. This is not like \\"The African Queen\\" where a good woman shows a wayward man the right path. This gal, Hannah, is in a horrible circumstance herself and is on her way to chucking religion down the sewer. She might be the one who needs a new path. These feel like real people in real life. It's not neat and things aren't wrapped up pretty in the end. But both people are on their way to making peace with themselves and each other when it's over.<br /><br />This is Considine's first feature film as director and he shows a deft hand. I never thought the camera was in the wrong spot and he coaxes great performances from the two leads. The music and all other production values were on par with the content. The one problem I had was that the British accents were so thick at times I simply could not catch all the dialogue. As a result I'm not entirely certain what point was being made. That those who are religious and those who are not have to find some way to meet in the middle? That's about the best I can come up with. But this is about as good a drama as I've ever seen and there are a couple of surprises that will give you pause. This is a definite watch if you're into this sort of thing.

B0079NQZLE|4.0|I heard this film served as the basis for THE HUNGER GAMES, so I was curious to see yet another Asian film that inspired American films (like THE DEPARTED based on INFERNAL AFFAIRS).  The premise of this Japanese film is pretty much the same as the American reincarnation.  A group of kids are sent to compete for their lives under the whip hand of their former teacher (ably played by Beat Takeshi, the actor who recently was Zatoichi, the blind swordsman).  Over forty of the kids are supposed to be cut down to a single survivor, but two \\"ringers\\" are thrown into the mix, two who had gone through a similar experience in the past and are more than capable of taking care of themselves and killing others.  A long and bloody sequence of elimination then takes place, while some of the kids find love among themselves and possible salvation.<br /><br />Human interest in certain characters comes and goes as they are featured and then dispatched.  Some characters evoke sympathy, others evoke loathing.  The conclusion is not all that neat and tidy, as if anything like this plot could ever be. Asian films resist proverbial Hollywood endings. Still, it is fascinating to watch if only to see how over forty kids would be whittled down.  I was reminded of that old Agatha Christie novel upon which several movies were based -- AND THEN THERE WERE NONE or TEN LITTLE INDIANS.  The drama consisted of seeing how people were going to get knocked off, who was going to leave the screen, who was going to survive (if any), and how the movie would end.  Overall, I regard this as a superior genre film for action oriented viewers; it's violent and bloody, yes, but nothing like the SAW movies wallowing in horror and gore.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt is one of the \\"Must have\\" cds of the 90s... and I have it. Now i´m going for the full discography and for the 90s classics!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|No one can deny that these film makers put their money on the screen. The CGI effects were eye-popping and many of the on-location physical sets were amazing, such as the scene when they first contact the alien vessel at sea. The stunt work was also impressive. As so many others have noted, please leave your brain at the door and simply enjoy it for what it is. That said, I did admire the writers for coming up with a refreshing take on the Aliens. In so may other films they are portrayed as slimy, insect-like monstrosities but these aliens are somewhat human-like and they exhibited qualities that defy the norm, such as their rescue mission to retrieve one of their crew members captured by the humans. Also, they were not mindlessly violent, such as the when the scientist encounters one is the communications shed - it lets him leave unharmed? I didn't see that coming. I also liked the fact that the film makers found a role for some disabled and retired veterans. Very cool. On the special features there a short clip of the woman who trained Rihanna to shoot weapons and move like a professional warrior, no disrespect to Rihanna but I was kind of wondering why they just didn't cast her.

0525953728|5.0|First, I do not understand what all the HOO-RAH is all about concerning the fact that this book was written.<br /><br />There (to me, at least) is nothing that is given away, or etc., that could be of a national interest issue. And, we are getting the story and details about the Mission from a first-hand source instead of the news-media.<br /><br />To me the Real \\"Bad Piece\\" in all this is the fact that the news-media chose to reveal \\"Owen's\\" real name when he purposely published this book under the pseudonym to, I am sure, protect his and his family's safety, etc. To me that element was truly wrong-doing on the part of the media. Once again, Shame on Them.<br /><br />Truly, this book is a Really Great Read, from page one right through to the end where \\"Owen\\" states that proceeds are going to the families of these lost SEALS...I personally think that is admirable, and certainly a correct place to direct some of the money generated by this book. Further, the first half of the book is \\"back story\\" telling of the development and training of a SEAL, and it is fascinating reading to be shared all this wonderful background. It certainly adds to the knowledge of these Brave Men who daily put their very lives on the line for those of us here at Home so that we may be Safe and Sound.<br /><br />At about the halfway point of the book, the attention shifts to the Bin Laden story itself, and I found the whole thing just mesmerizing to read through, moment-by-moment, as the SEALS themselves experienced it. The details that \\"Owen\\" shares with us are not elaborately expanded from what we gathered from the News Networks at the time, yet enough is revealed to clarify everything for us.<br /><br />I Highly recommend that you read this really wonderful book about these Brave Men and their work that daily makes our world a better place to be, mission by mission. This is True Heroism, Selfless Giving and Doing in the Face of Near Certain Death or Injury, etc.<br /><br />Thank You, EACH and EVERY ONE of you BRAVE MEN.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Of the accumulated reviews of this new Bob Dylan album its difficult to find one that has not referenced that \\"Tempest\\" shares its name with Shakespeare's final play. With the great man into his 70's is the master musician leaving yet another tell tale sign? Let us exhort that this is not the case for on this form you can only plead that long may he run. Whatever Dylan's intentions the title is accurately appropriate since \\" Tempest\\" is a dark and often stormy affair notably containing a 14 minute and 45 verses long title song dedicated to the sinking of the Titanic where Dylan throws in some of his most vivid images, torrid tales and pale sorrow not least a Captain who \\"In the dark illumination, he remembered bygone years/He read the Book of Revelation, filled his cup with tears\\". It is wordplay of the highest order and actually names check Leonard DiCaprio to bring it all up to date.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"Duqunese Whistle\\" sounding like a track from a honky tonk jukebox until Dylan's voice kicks in and commences an excellent railroad song which skips along at a fair old pace as the stations pass by. The lovely country lament \\"Soon after midnight\\" follows, so effortless and yet so right. The mood changes quickly for the near eight minute long \\"Narrow Way\\" a barbed electric guitar piece which rocks hard enough to performed in garages across the US. Dylan's last proper studio album was \\"Together through life\\" in 2009 (let us forget his yuletide abomination in that same year) and that suffered from serious sagging in the mid section (a problem for all men of a certain age). \\"Tempest\\" is closer to \\"Modern times\\" in this respect since every song fits and it's a solid set not least the excellent trilogy of songs from four to six. This comprises Dylan at his most reflective in the superb \\"Long and Wasted Years\\" where the master lyricist concludes that \\"we cried on that cold and frosty morn/we cried because our souls were torn so much for tears/so much for these long and wasted years\\". He is at his snarling best in the belligerent \\"Pay in blood\\" where his excellent road band provide great support. He also appears to tip a nod to Gillian Welch in \\"Scarlet town\\" which appears a distant cousin of the song on \\"The Harrow and Harvest\\". It's a great Dylan performance with that old gravelly voice sounding as vital as ever and strong to boot. Next up Muddy Waters \\"Mannish Boy\\" provides the backdrop to \\"Early Roman Kings\\" with a great David Hidalgo cantina-blues accordion providing the necessary earthy accompaniment. Dylan has always specialised in songs where vengeance is the unifying theme and \\"Tin Angel\\" couldn't be further removed from the Joni Mitchell love song of the same name sounding more like a Nick Cave murder ballad with its gory bloodshot finale. Having mentioned the albums huge \\"Titanic\\" narrative leaves us finally to touch on \\"Roll on John\\" a seven minute tribute to John Lennon starting with his assassination, referencing the Quarrymen, Hamburg and various sources of Beatles legend not least part of the lyric of \\"A day in the life\\". At this point it is this reviewers least favourite song on \\"Tempest\\" since if it wasn't composed by any one other than Dylan it could sound somewhat gauche and overtly sentimental. It is certainly does not match Paul Simon's \\"The Late great Johnny Ace\\" but it's a tender recognition of an old friend and proves that Dylan can be sweet hearted and nostalgic when needed.<br /><br />This is Dylan's 35th studio album and stands as a firm equal to \\"Modern Times\\" as his best album of the 21st century. We have no right to expect albums this good after all this time and the fact that he continues to confound, puzzle and challenge should be cause for rejoicing. 2012 looks like being the year of the veteran with great albums by Dr John, Paul Buchanan, Bill Fay and Leonard Cohen. And yet amongst all this excellence \\"Tempest\\" confirms Dylan's rightful pole position as the greatest storyteller in rock historyck history
0525953728|5.0|Disregard any reviews that cite politics or security issues as the basis for not liking this book. I could not put this book down and finished it in three days. It's an excellent look into the type of men who carry out the most challenging missions our country has to accomplish. The story of how this all went down is one that needed to be told. If the Allies had been successful at taking out Hitler, wouldn't the people of the world have a right to know how it went down?

B003NHRGSQ|5.0|This book was amazing--VERY well-written. The description on the back of the book was awesome:<br />&#34;Their eyes, human eyes in wolf skulls, remind me of water: the clear blue of water reflecing in the spring sky, the brown of a brook churning with rainfall, the green of the lake in summer a the algae begins to bloom, the gray of a snow-choked river. It used to be only Sam's yellow  eyes that watched me from between the rain-soaked branches, but now, I feel the weight of the entire pack's gaze. The weight of things unknown, things unsaid.&#34;<br />It was really good book. I'd recomend it to anyone looking for a good Twilight-type series (as I like to say, this series is like the werewolf version of Twilight). Can't wait to read  Forever!!! :D

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Let me understand; was Charlize Theron jealous because Kristen Stewart is better looking than her? In what universe? Totally absurd but still a good movie worth watching for the special effects and the incredible performance of Charlize Theron.<br /><br />This is a free adaptation of the well know Snow White story, with several bad actors. The evil queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) saves the movie. Great presence and great acting as always. She definitely took over the movie. Although I knew the end of the movie (...who doesn't) I was rooting for the mean queen. I was really sad at the end when she died and she became old. Even then she was better looking than Snow White. Kristen Stewart is not believable in her role (she is not good actrice anyway), and the Huntsman has an Irish/Scottish accent that is annoying. We really don't believe anytime during the two hours that Hemsworth is this solid guy that will save Stewart in the dark forest and will protect her from all the mean spirits. The kissing scene where Snow White stands up and walk after eating the apple is so poorly done that is laughable. There is another character in the movie, an old friend of Snow White that we don't know exactly what he does and why he is there.<br /><br />In order to make the movie better they should first try to find somebody who is a better actor that Stewart. Second there is a huge disadvantage to compare ANY woman to Charlize Theron (even the older version of the queen towards the end of the movie). They should have definitely find somebody else representing the mean ugly queen who is not as good looking as Charlize Theron. The only time that the words ugly and Charlize Theron can be used in the same sentence is the film \\"Monster\\". She definitely deserved the oscar with that performance.<br /><br />I definitely liked the movie (4 stars) and the special effects are just awesome. The scene with Stewart and the troll in the forest while funny and not believable because of Stewart's acting, is really well acted by the troll. They also succeeded to put the head of some really good actors on the body of dwarfs (like Bob Hoskins). The special effects are unbelievable!ng, is really well acted by the troll. They also succeeded to put the head of some really good actors on the body of dwarfs (like Bob Hoskins). The special effects are unbelievable!
B000GRUMPU|5.0|I'm a fan of this movie, and when it came out I bought it in fullscreen edition. Because the fullscreen edition did not have as many special features, I ordered the widescreen edition to get the listed special features:<br />(\\"Poseidon: A Ship on a Soundstage\\" documentary on the complexities of making a modern adventure movie<br />\\"A Shipmate's Diary\\" - a film school intern's experiences on the set<br />\\"Poseidon: Upside Down\\" featurette on the set design<br />Rogue Waves documentary, originally made for The History Channel<br />Theatrical trailer)<br /><br />However, this DVD only came with the first special feature, which was also on the fullscreen edition! Disappointing!

B007N31ZYC|5.0|I love this movie and the entire cast!  Classic DeNiro and Pesci!  The fact that this is based off of actual events makes it even more enjoyable.  I love stories of Vegas in its hayday.  Compelling story, little long, and a movie I can watch over and over again.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Overall if you're looking for a movie to kill time with some decent fighting action this overall isn't a bad one to check out sadly though while you have Snow White on the title of the movie the pathetic actress to star in that role was so sadly deficient in acting ability or skills you couldn't help but wish she just stayed contracted to play her emotionless character in the Twilight series.  Out of the cast the ones who gave the best emotional portrayal of their characters would be the evil queen and the huntsman if they gave much less screen time to the talentless Stewart I would have been much happier but since Stewart is riding the coattails of the Twilight success(Thanks to teenage girls) we're forced to hear her awful emotionless dialogue throughout the movie as well lack of any emotion on her stoic face throughout the movie think a female version of Keanu Reeves.  If you can look past Stewart's lack of acting ability and talents the movie is actually good but sadly you're stuck having to deal with Stewart to much in the movie and for myself that took a lot of the enjoyment out of the movie.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I purchased Wheat Belly for my Kindle after hearingTV host Bill O'Reilly sing its praises.  This book is really well written with lots of good information. Just about everyone will find at least one chapter aimed directly at them. Many illnesses are discussed with specific details on how wheat effects that disease. I definitely give it a thumbs-up.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like doing the puzzles, but I downloaded several puzzle packs and can only find a few of them, where did the rest go. If  I could see and play all the puzzles I got, I would give it five stars.

1400096936|5.0|I have lived in many of the cities in which this book unfolds, also in Guadalajara,Jalisco, I am fluent in Spanish, so I understand many of the slang phrases and customs of the people. This is an excellent portrial of the lives of citizens on both sides of the border in dealing with the drug culture and the narcotraficantes.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is a great continue of Book I. The relationship of the opposite gender is so appealing. The respect that Mr. Grey and Ann have for each other is fantastic.  Most relationships are complicated. It on to Book 3. Freedom for everyone.
0385334206|5.0|I feel like Vonnegut's writing style is very polarizing.  People either love or hate it.  It might be offensive to some, while others find it hilarious.  I think it happens to be brilliant satire with nothing held back.  I'm not one to balk at profanity or think \\"OMG! He actually drew that in a book?\\", but if you are, don't read it.  It's brilliant, straight-from-the-head-to-the-paper type of writing that's funny while pointedly satirical.<br /><br />It's a quick and enjoyable read.  If you're looking for something a little different to read, pick this up!  If you like it, be sure to check out Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse-Five, and Bluebeard as well.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|I'm a big fan of \\"Robin Hood and the Prince of Thieves\\", so I was excited to see a different telling of this story.  This version is much longer and slower than the other one.  However, I believe it's a far more realistic portrayal than the 90s version.  As always, Crowe shines as the dark and moody warrior he is somewhat typecast as since Gladiator, in stark contrast to Costner's noble, nothing-bad-can-happen-to-me, I-don't-have-an-English-accent character.<br /><br />In short, if you want something that is a more accurate portrayal of the legend and time period and don't mind some slow spots, then check this out.
0143034901|4.0|\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" hooked me from the very first moment.  The entire first chapter, \\"The Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\" could have been a short story on its own.  I was blown away by how hooked on this book I got, just by that first chapter. Not to mention, how jealous I was that the actual Cemetery of Forgotten Books is a place I would never be able to visit!<br /><br />Daniel is a boy who is introduced to a book\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Julian Carax when taken on a visit to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books by his father.<br /><br />\\"Perhaps the bewitching atmosphere of the place had got the better of me, but I felt sure that The Shadow of the Wind had been waiting for me there for years, probably since before I was born,\\" Daniel said (p. 7).<br /><br />How truly right Daniel was.  This book catapulted him into a mystery surrounding this book that was filled with friendship, deceit, lies, love, lust, family, brutal attacks, and death.<br /><br />Who was burning Julian Carax's novels?<br /><br />Why were people suddenly following Daniel on the street?<br /><br />What is the story behind Fumero, the corrupt police officer who is suddenly after Daniel?<br /><br />Is Julian Carax dead or alive, in Paris or Barcelona?<br /><br />Will Daniel survive the solving of this mystery or will he be a casualty in the process?<br /><br />One character says, \\"Never before have I felt trapped, seduced, and caught up in a story. . . the way I did with that book\\" (p. 27).  That is exactly how I felt about \\"The Shadow of the Wind,\\" completely caught up in the intrigue.<br /><br />This book is not a quick, light read.  I recommend this book to those who love to read, and will take the time to think about and remember the details surrounding this mystery.  This book is well worth the time put into it!<br /><br />Oh, and one of the best parts of the book is the walking tour guide provided by the author at the end of the novel.  Anyone up for a trip to Barcelona?<br /><br />Thank you to my fabulous London friend Susannah for recommending this read!<br /><br />I think it's rare to be sucked into a book right at the beginning, like I was with \\"The Shadow of the Wind.\\"<br /><br />What have you read that was love at first chapter?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca (LoveAtFirstBook book blogger)to my fabulous London friend Susannah for recommending this read!<br /><br />I think it's rare to be sucked into a book right at the beginning, like I was with \\"The Shadow of the Wind.\\"<br /><br />What have you read that was love at first chapter?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca (LoveAtFirstBook book blogger)
0061765236|5.0|An absolute page turner! I was rooting for Chris the whole way through. I have also seen comments from people saying that the book didn't give them enough in the end. In real life you don't always find out why people want to harm themselves. I think it was better to keep us guessing. 5 Stars!!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Not very interesting as I had hoped it would be. Not a fun game for anyone under 68 years old .
B00514HDNW|5.0|This seminal work is singlehandedly responsible for kicking off the modern zombie craze in my opinion. The book is dark, taught and gut-wrenching. It was originally published in the 1950s, and I can't begin to imagine what all those happy `Father Knows Best' readers made of it at the time. And remember, this was way before the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War.<br /><br />Though the actual monsters were in fact vampires, their penchant for coming out at night and ripping their victims to pieces is very much in the zombie vein. For me, what's most interesting is the author's ability to spend the majority of the book with Robert Neville alone as he battles not only these nocturnal demons but the ghosts of his dead family and his own heartbreaking loneliness.<br /><br />For anyone out there who appreciates zombie literature, I highly recommend this book. You will not be disappointed.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I loaned my copy of Season 2 to a friend who does not want to give it up...so being a good friend, I ordered another copy for myself.  This will be one of those programs you watch year after year - PBS is such a gift to us all. Looking forward to Season 3!
B0087YYHZU|5.0|One of my very favorite movies of all time!  It has great music, great acting, and a lot of laughs.  I enjoyed the added commentary about the making of the movie.  I definitely recommend this movie on Blu-ray.  Gene Kelly was the master, both in dancing and choreography.  He and Debbie Reynolds were perfect together in all their numbers.  Donald O'Connor doing \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" is worth the price of the movie in itself.  Even if it was \\"before your time,\\" this is a classic and should be seen by everyone.  You won't regret it!
B004SH40BQ|4.0|I bought this transmitter for my iPod Classic 160Gb which lives in a switcheasy crystal case. I wanted it to send tunes to both my Plantronics bluetooth headphones, and the Logitech wireless speaker adapter that I use for music in my office.<br /><br />First of all, it arrived in 1 day. Thanks, Amazon Prime!<br /><br />Appearance:<br />Looks like it's supposed to be there. Sticks out 7/16\\" from the case.<br /><br />Operation:<br />As described, it's super-simple...put your receiver into finding mode and plug the Kokkia transmitter into your iPod. They find each other, and in about 10 seconds, it's transmitting. When I power down my iPod, the transmitter powers down as well. Beyond that, there's nothing left to think about. It linked up to both of my receivers flawlessly.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Works great so far!<br /><br />Cons:<br />The only negative I've discovered is that the volume buttons on my headphones do not directly control the volume on the iPod the way they do when linked to my iPhone which has bluetooth built in. They operate as two separate volumes...one on the iPod, and one on the headphones, and the sum can be modified by either. I usually send the iPod volume out at a fairly loud level and then use the headphone volume to control what I hear.<br /><br />I'm sure it will affect battery life. Time will tell. The convenience is worth it.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|If you are a romantic at heart, then this is the book for you. The book is about two people who fall in love but because of circumstances they have decisions to make, a life to live and other people to consider. What's more important in life the love of your life or the life you are living for other people?  Forget the movie, the casting was horrible, no chemistry, the script veered from the story line of the book, so for me you absolutely must read the book. I really enjoyed it and I'm sure you will too.<br /><br />Short review from me:<br />If you've ever stood on the beach, looking over the ocean and had your mind wander back to a past love this is the book for you !

So thank you Amazon for stocking up. Shipping was great. I only wish customs wouldn't pick out all the amazon packages to tax. In the Netherlands taxes/duties are very high. But I'm glad all the same. Great bluray, must have!<br /><br />Eugene
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|This book written Susan Kiernan-Lewis is the first I've read of her books.  A Mystery takes place in Atlanta and in France.  She has her details down, she writes many phrases in French, a little annoying since I don't speak or read French, she gives you little hints of what they say, still....I had the mystery figured out too early, kept hoping I was wrong. I didn't appreciate the love interest, seemed superficial and proved so in the end, a little unsatisfying.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I'm 13 years old, and I watched this movie with my parents and friends. At first my mom wasn't interested at all, but then as the story kept going her eyes were completely glued to the screen after ten minutes. If you're under 13, as long as you're not afraid of fake blood, kissing, and a few violent scenes that don't have blood spraying everywhere, then this is the right movie for the whole family to enjoy! So grab some popcorn, jump on the couch, turn off the lights and start watching!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This show will suck you in and grab your attention from a whole other time period but you won't even care because the human drama is on Parr with the best I have ever seen. Even my 11& 16 year olds  fell in love with the show.you will not be disappointed.
B008OHV5HS|5.0|Be warned.. when you start playing this CD, hang on. Threshold is back, and boy, do they mean business. Damian Wilson, their first lead singer, is back as well and sounding stronger than ever. I've been an ardent fan of these guys for many years now, and each release just keeps getting better.<br />They are the truest example of a progressive band: they adapt to an ever-changing musical climate, but still retain their magical formula of melody, power and intelligent song writing. If you're looking for an album of pretentious playing and noodling, then pick up the latest Dream Theater albums. Threshold see their music as craft, not flash. They believe in the music they play and the lyrics they write, and it shows. Any filler on this wonderful album? No.. each song stands on its own and demands your total attention when you listen.. if you've never heard them before, give them a try. They make many of the bands in this genre look ordinary and unexceptional..my choice for album of the year.

B004LP3AYI|4.0|4.5 stars. This book was much different than the first for me. In the first book, I was struggling to feel Richard's inner struggle with his new role as Seeker and hero. However in this book, I felt his conflict much more intensely which I liked. In the first book, Richard was a little to nieve for me but in this book I felt he was more mature and had grown as a character.<br /><br />When I picked this book up, I didn't expect it to be as long as it was (900+). The first book was roughly 500 pages so this was a huge jump in length but I thought it was appropriate because a lot happens in this book. The length didn't bother me but it did take me a while to get through.<br /><br />Overall this book had a decidedly darker feel to it. It was more about self acceptance and then of course the character conflicts and their inner struggles were interesting and complex. A enjoyable read for sure!<br /><br />See my full review here: [...]

0345803485|1.0|I am so disappointed that no major media outlets are acknowledging the fact that this book is a bomb. And by that I mean a real stinker. E L James will be on Katie Couric on Monday!? Are there no writers and producers in television and media that have studied writing or literature at a university level? I think the joke's on us. The author researched low-level teen speak by riding the tube and thought the North American market would accept it without question or insult to the intelligence. The characters are so obviously British, but that is the least of my concerns. Improbable and ridiculous storyline aside, I have enjoyed better writing quality in Harlequin novels. Not that I've read one since I was sixteen. The reading level and seemingly target audience are teens, which in itself is highly disturbing. Frankly it's insulting how dumb the author thinks we are! Sadly, the sales figures back her up. E L James cannot possibly be as unintelligent (although possibly inexperienced) as her writing would suggest. This was a calculated dumbing-down and frankly I'm offended. In fact, I'm impressed just how cunning she is. Her plan worked and she's laughing all the way to the bank. Shame on us for voting with our dollars. I wish I could break out the mind eraser and unread the book. I couldn't finish book one and wish I had those hours of my life back. I should have had a colonoscopy.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Although I have been hooked on this series of books since the first book, I think this has been my favorite so far.  The nature of each character is revealed in some unexpected ways and the action moves the story forward so rapidly that I could not put the book down.  I could not wait to get to the next chapter concerning my favorites to see what happens to them.  These books are long, so if you haven't bought a battery for your Kindle for awhile, be sure to have an extra handy as you won't want to wait.
B000002C2E|5.0|There are a few weak spots on this album  - I don't love \\"Highlands\\", and considering it takes up a huge chunk of space you think that would be fatal, but it's not.Lanois' production gives the album an otherworldly feel - it comes out of your speakers (or headphones) from the first few notes of \\"Love Sick\\". It gets even eerier on \\"Dirt Road Blues\\", which sounds like it's channeled through an am radio of a '62 Nash Rambler at 4 in the morning.\\"Standing in the Doorway\\" shows an older man's take on the futility of love - instead of the anger of \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", there's just defeat and resignation. \\"Million Miles\\" and \\"'Til I fell in Love with you\\" & \\"Can't Wait\\" are the minor works on the album, but still good. \\"Tryin' To Get To Heaven\\" is a minor masterpiece - hell, maybe a major one. It's the flipside of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" - instead of \\"when you ain't got nuthin/You got Nuthin' to Lose\\", the sentiment is now \\"When you think that you've lost everything, You find out you can always lose a little more\\". You then move onto the other major works of the album \\"It's Not Dark Yet\\", another rumination on mortality, and then Dylan's creepiest and scariest song \\"Cold Irons Bound\\" - any song that starts out \\"I'm Beginning to Hear Voices/And There's no one Around\\" is bound to terrify, and it does. \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" is Dylan's simple june/spoon/moon love song, the kind of song he can write before breakfast, and it becomes a #1 hit (and it did, for others). \\"Highlands\\" goes on forever, and theres' the great Neil Young namecheck - but it doesn't capitvate me the way it does for others.<br /><br />One more note on the production - it's one of Bob's most cohesive albums, in both sound and subject matter, so it should be taken as a whole, not it bites. People often say that dylan plays it too close, or makes fun of his audience, but he bares it all on here - it's as honest an album as you'll ever hear.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Let's take a moment to re-imagine the classic fairy tale, Snow White, as something other than the whimsical version we all know. The story remains much the same-- A noble King and Queen give birth to a lovely daughter (Snow White). Shortly thereafter the Queen dies, and in all his grief, our King takes on a beautiful new bride. Little does the King know this will be his undoing, for his new wife, Ravenna, is an evil, man-hating sorceress. Soon the King is dead, Snow White is imprisoned and our quiet kingdom plunged into darkness and despair. With a little bit of \\"Mirror, mirror on the wall\\" action, Ravenna learns just how much her and Snow White's fates are intertwined. Snow will bring about Ravenna's destruction or she'll bring her total immortality. Naturally, you can guess which option Ravenna prefers. But in this version of the tale, Snow isn't as helpless as her Disney counterpart. She manages to escape her cell and goes on the run through the big, bad forest. Ravenna is mad, like steaming mad, so she enlists the dashing (but drunk) Huntsman to capture our much revered, Snow. During their epic journey, both the Huntsman and Snow White discover the grandeur of the destiny they're bound to fulfill and learn just how much they need one another.<br /><br />In a world full of reboots, it's hard to keep a fresh perspective but Rupert Sanders somehow managed to pull it off in Snow White and the Huntsman. He's turned this familiar tale into a medieval epic adventure and made our seemingly docile heroine a total warrior. He has a distinctive and original directing style and its quick-cut nature works with the story he's decided to tell. I like what Sanders has done here and it works given the darker nature of the source material. The original Grimm story was not a happy one--it was dark and foreboding and, well, grim. I like that he wasn't afraid to take it to a darker place and he did so without losing the magic and whimsy of Disney's version. There are still dwarves and magic mirrors and poisoned apples and they all fit naturally in their own way. Without a doubt, this is the type of movie you want to watch in a movie theatre. But stunning as the cinematography is, the film does have its weaknesses.<br /><br />I guess my main beef is the fact that the character development is somewhat lacking. We're given interesting back-story on Ravenna and Snow and the Huntsman and not nearly enough time to take it all in. It's enough to want to know more but not enough to satisfy. This causes the story to feel somewhat rushed and underdeveloped. It's like we're given the Sparknotes version of the story, not the whole thing. One of the movie's stronger elements was the great cast. What more could you want out of a movie featuring the likes of Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth and Kristen Stewart? Okay, majority of the cast is strong--I admit, I'm not a big fan of Stewart. I feel like she plays the same wide-eyed, mumbling girl in every movie she's in. She barely registers any kind of emotion and when she does, it's virtually indistinguishable from any other emotion. For example, there's a moment when she turns from a panic-stricken princess into a strong soldier, but it was laughable. No offense Kristen, but I just don't get the cut of your jib, if you know what I'm saying.<br /><br />Theron as the Queen Ravenna, on the other hand, she made that movie. Every time she came on screen, I just couldn't tear my eyes away. Not only was she absolutely stunning, she was utterly terrifying. I feared for the lives of everyone she came into contact with. She brought evil to a whole new level and it was frightening. Then there's Hemsworth who is certainly talented enough but his character was overshadowed by the phenomenal performances of Theron and the bumbling of Stewart. I don't think he was given enough of a chance to shine on his own. And the chemistry between him and Stewart felt too forced, I just wasn't buying their love story. Where the main castwas lacking in chemistry, the supporting cast certainly succeeded. With the talents of Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost and Sam Spruell it's hard to go wrong. They own the screen and some of the movie's better moments are thanks to them. Despite its set-backs, I think Sanders has crafted a beautiful and strong retelling of Snow White. Overall, I think the Grimm brothers would be proud.<br /><br />Food for Thought: As Sanders' debut film, Snow White and the Huntsman is quite strong. It's full of action, adventure, drama with even a touch of comedy--all the things you want in a summer blockbuster. In the same vane as the original Grimm fairy tale, we see Snow White in a darker light which makes the heroine's arc that much more powerful. Well, at least it would if you actually cared for the heroine but this was one movie where I was rooting for the villain instead. A visually impressive film, it's one that's worth the money despite Stewart's relatively bland performance as Snow.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/5 starswas lacking in chemistry, the supporting cast certainly succeeded.

This book takes you through the details of creation, revision, editiing and publishing a book on Amazon.  It also provides significant insight into the presentation and marketing side of your publication.  There are many writers out there that have \\"how-to books\\", short story collections and novels that could take advantage of this opportunity.  It's an exciting possibility for writers that can't get thru the \\"transom\\" and need an outlet for their creativity.  Thank you Amazon.

B004VSTP4Y|3.0|**There are spoilers in this review**  Maybe about a year ago I read Shiver and loved it. A couple weeks ago I saw the last two books on the shelf in the library and thought I'd check those out too. I enjoyed Linger, and honestly it reminded me of how much I love the author's language and style. Naturally, I picked up Forever with equal enthusiasm, and was disappointed of how much the author's style could *not* make up for how bad this story is.  I'll tell you about the story. It's slow. Sloooow. Despite Isabel presenting the gang with a promise of imminent disaster if they didn't take action soon right from the get-go, the issue was barely acknowledged. It was like &#34;Hang on, can I call you back in a while?&#34; and after pages and pages of toiling with teen angsty feelings, it's &#34;okay, now what were we talking about? Oh yeah, the complete and total inhalation of the pack. Well I--Oh wait, I've got to go back to sulking for awhile. Call you later!&#34; And so on and so forth. I got so bored I had to skim over pages just to get to a mildly engaging section. That's the best I can describe the &#34;thrilling&#34; parts. Mildly engaging. Every time the date of the wolf hunt was bumped up a notch, I thought surely they'll do something *now*? Nope.   I think we're over the halfway point before they start going from a crawl to a walk, and even then it's a stagnant pace. Then out of NOWHERE a sweet angel of mercy, who probably got so sick of watching these idiot kids do nothing about their problem, decided to bless them with a new piece of land to put their pack in.  At that point it was just like &#34;0-kay kiddies. I've done the hard part for you. Can you PLEASE just meet us halfway now?&#34; Sure, they got around to it...eventually, procrastinating in the typical teenage fashion right up until they had no choice. Then a brief, mildly-engaging scene ensures, in which parts of the pack die and Isabel summons enough courage to run her car through the pack to spur them on and stop her maniacal father from the hunt. Then we have a very mundane ending.  Surprisingly, the scenes that could have been the most interesting were cut out, such as the implied argument between Isabel and her father after the hunt, or Cole's interactions with Shelby while he sets up traps in the woods. Even MORE surprisingly, Cole's scientific genius brain doesn't actually live up to it's hype built up from Linger. The only thing he manages to conclude is that Sam really IS cured, solely because he was in wolf form at the time of injection. How that's supposed to make a difference is beyond me, but hey, they get to live happily ever after, so who cares?  If you ask me, reading Shiver alone will be the best thing you can do. Forget about this being a trilogy and just be content with the first story. The second one is good, but not as great, and it'll just make you want to read the third, so forget about it.
0525953728|1.0|What can I say?  People swallow this without thinking.  This book is a work of fiction, and the hype about it, including the alleged \\"disclosure of secrets,\\" is fantasy.  Osama bin Laden, an acknowledged CIA \\"asset\\" who met with National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski (search the web for the photo), was a sick man dying of renal failure months before the events attributed to him on 9/11/2001.  He expired late that year.  The tale of the \\"neutralization\\" of Osama by Navy SEALs is pure Orwell.  This book is a demonstration the Ministry of Truth is our terrible reality.
B001S86J1C|2.0|The movie I received (Ferris Bueller's Day Off Bluray) had a cut all the way through the front case label and all the way down the case.  Seems like it was cut through with a box cutter.  Also, the item I received is not the same as what is pictured on the website.  The web picture shows a much more elaborate packaging whereas what I received was cheaply made.  Just a standard flimsy Blu-ray box with with no insert or extra sleeve.
B008XGML5U|3.0|this is not the next sabbath cd not by far tony's iommi cd was just about that greats cd he had done in 20 years but this is a mixed bag of tracks tony must of thought highly of and ian had sung on but not the best of the bunch but still hoistoricly musical cd.this cd seams to cover many more fascets of their musical career then two cds should it's a rollercoaster of ups and downs that i personally felt was too much at times.this should have been looked at more closely and put together better as a soundscape not a jumble of songs as it comes across as.someone must have felt tony may not make it threw his therapy for cancer so them should push this out,not very good for what should or could have been a career ending cd/legacy ender maybe but i don't think so the new sabbath will come someday hopfully expanded to a double cd set/or a triple 2 cds and a live disc(that would sell alot).anyway this maybe an must have for some but or me it like sabbath 83-97 easy to forget most of the songs on this but some are here so they will get to the major league music listeners because they were rare tracks and hard to find,use your own descretion wither to buy this or not?I actually feel bad not giving tony a 5 star but it's not!
B00821OX98|4.0|I stream this through a PS3 using Amazon's VOD app. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because I paid for HD but I'm pretty sure we're only seeing the SD version. This may be more in part due to the internet speeds I get from my ISP, which are not great, and not so much Amazon's fault. The show is great though, a roommate got me hooked while he watched season two, so had to see season one!
B000002KYK|5.0|After seeing this in the theaters at its original release, I loved not only the movie but the music as well.  This \\"Orchestral Adaptation Of Music Composed For The Motion Picture By Vangelis\\" was the only thing out there and I loved it immediately and love it to this day. I never missed an official soundtrack because this was all I knew. When the \\"Official\\" soundtrack was finally released I was initially disappointed because some of my favorite songs from the first album had been changed, some had been left off, and others that I had never heard were on it, along with the annoying dialog excerpts from the movie. By now, though, I have come to love them both pretty equally and it kind of depends on what kind of mood I'm in that dictatess which I want to listen to.  In this day and age of ipods set to shuffle and 'complete' albums not really being produced anymore, this is one (as well as the 'official' one)that you have to listen to correctly, from beginning to end.  It evokes the movie in your head, unlike many soundtrack albums.  If you are a fan, there is no excuse for not owning both.
1401322786|5.0|I've never written a review before, but am compelled to write this one.  Albom is one of my favorite authors and with this book he has created yet another classic.  \\"The Timekeeper\\" is a fable easily read in one sitting.  Type-A personality readers will connect with Victor Delamonte, a man who believes he can control his destiny, even in death.  Any reader who has parented a teenager will connect with the other main character, Sarah Lemon, a girl the antithesis of Victor who believes she has no control over her destiny.  Any reader who has struggled with illness, depression or death will know the theme to be all too painfully true:<br />\\"There is a reason God limits our days.\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"To make each one precious.\\" (p. 206)<br />Any one who recognizes the inherent truth in this statement will love this book.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Amazon solicited this review of Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins.<br />As of September 13, 2012, I have read the first two books and am about 1/3 of the way into the third book, \\"Mockingjay\\".<br />Pay attention to that character development, Mockingjay, throughout the series.  It can't be a spoiler to tell you that the young woman Katniss survives the first two books.  She is the main character and hero afterall.  She also is the strong, independent, feminist leader coming of age. She possesses innate skills and understanding to overcome political corruption, and oppressive tyranny.  Is she an Ayn Rand hero?  I think she presents a call to action that only youth can answer.<br /><br />It took me less than three days to read each of the first two books.  You may have time to read each book straight through.  Quick reads, but outstanding creative writing, I think.
0800141849|5.0|I'm not sure why I love this movie when I feel like watching a fiction romance. I rarely watch fiction but this one I never get tired of. It's unique and enjoyable. Maybe a little far-fetched but that's what most fiction is. Well made with super acting. The only thing that bothers me is there is a little swearing and, even worse, God's name is used in those swear words. I'm at the point where I may have to pass it along because of it. Other than that, it is delightful.

B00447G2PM|3.0|I enjoyed the 3D scenery and action shots, especially the clear water and coral reefs. However, I was really annoyed and tired quickly of the narrated script that droned on and on about global warning, species extinction, and other conservationist activism. It's a shame that demos of 3D DVDs must kowtow to this type of propaganda.<br /><br />Update: Although IMAX documentaries present strikingly realistic demos of the 3D video format, their commentary drones on and on pushing the conservationist political agenda; it's way, way overdone. Therefore, especially after reading other reviews of IMAX 3D products I have not yet purchased, I will not buy any more of them.
0525953728|5.0|i bought the book because i saw it on the news and thought it would be interusting to read and see if what the news said was true, but anyway thats not the subject. this auther is very interusting in the way he words things, he's not afrade to cuss so if that offends you dont buy this book. id really like to meet this guy because he is VERY funny. but one thing that he did that i thought wasnt very wise was how much info he released about his personal life, now with that said he says in the begning that he changed the names, exact times, and dates of the places and people but still you can tell some of the info true by the way he says and words things. i bet if someone really wanted to find this guy they could, heck i think i even could  given enfough time. point is i dont read a lot of books and i got the book less than 4 days ago and im already on the 8th chapter and ill probably be on the 10th or 11th by the end of the day its really that good. SO BUY IT!

B00021HBGS|5.0|I bought these tub stickers for my kids to make bathing more fun. Well, I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old. I put both of them in the tub and they play with these for a long time! The smallest one even throws a tantrum when I pull him out of the water. They enjoy themselves a lot with these. They even \\"paste\\" these on their bodies and play with them. The only drawback I see is that my toddler bit on them and they do loose their shape becuase of their foamy shape. However, I do understand they are not for biting and I am careful of taking them away from his mouth!<br />Other than that, it is fun to watch them play and enjoy this toy so much!<br />Would definetely buy another kind of \\"tub stickers\\" for them to play, maybe animls or others...<br />Also, don't expect these to stick to the tub like glue, they do slip... but this is what also makes it fun, right?
B0054LJGWS|4.0|I REALLY enjoyed this book, right up to the last 50 pages or so. Maybe I was expecting too much though this story is about the Apocalypse so I don't think that it is wrong to expect a BIG finish.<br /><br />The story unfolds with the often dry-witted humor you would expect from these great authors. As we find out early on even Satan worshipers aren't always good with details, Demons don't play well with each other and that humans blame the Devil for things that are actually thought up by humans, while missing actual demon caused phenomena such as dropped calls.<br /><br />Without giving away any (really) significant plot details (and that's really hard for me to accept), I expected more from the conclusion. We have the Anti-christ, the armies of Heaven, the hordes of Hell, the riders of the Apocalypse, the Metatron, Beelzebub, a witch, witch hunters, computer viruses, and an assortment of other characters (not to mention an apparently upset Satan) that should lend themselves to all sorts of chaos, and all we get are a few philosophical asides, a crossed sword or two, a \\"semi-circular hand movement\\" and with that the Apocalypse is averted. I was hoping for something more, and I don't think that's unreasonable considering the possibilities.<br /><br />Despite the weak ending I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. The balance of the novel is great reading.<br /><br />This book is actually quite old, having been written before Pratchett and Gaiman were famous but not published until their relative fame was enough to convince publishers to give it a go. Perhaps a re-write of the ending today would lead to something more formidable.<br /><br />One other point of concern. I read this book on an iPad using the Kindle app. Many of the funniest bits are contained within the 'Notes'. Clicking on the Notes link within the main story was easy enough. Unfortunately I had a devil of a time clicking back from the Notes to the main story. It often took several attempts and had me thinking that this was intentionally frustrating, ala one of the Devil's tricks designed to make us angry and mean to each other.e thinking that this was intentionally frustrating, ala one of the Devil's tricks designed to make us angry and mean to each other.

B009329ZF2|1.0|Perhaps that \\"p\\" at the end should be replaced by a rhyming letter.<br /><br />My excuse for watching is that (a) I knew nothing about it, and (b) that my countryman, the usually excellent Mr. Neeson, was in it. One makes these little mistakes in life... I can only conclude that Mr. Neeson is down to his last zillion.<br /><br />The good points; brilliant CGI.<br /><br />The bad points; absolutely everything else. It features a woman singer (Piranha? Something like that) who, thankfully, doesn't sing, although that might well have been an improvement on the stilted, cringeworthy dialogue and complete lack of acting in this gargantuan turkey. The entire enterprise is as far-fetched as the proverbial bucket of sugar from China and I struggle to recollect anything I've ever seen that is so totally implausible and disbelief suspension-defying. And of course it comes loaded with rah-rah sentiment and heart-on-sleeve moments for our gallant boys in uniform. However, if you enjoy cringing in embarrassment at the cinematic equivalent of spherical equine waste product, you will be in seventh heaven.

B0001NBMBC|2.0|i like some songs from VOL 3, like duality...in fact, i think this the best album from Slipknot...it´s way more polished than the first 2, but that´s better for a band like slipknot because while the songs sound the same, you can hear some clean vocals from Corey Taylor. and the guitars actually bring one or two melodies....as on ALL slipknot stuff, it´s really hard to argue with the whole album, because all the songs are way similar with NO variation....well, slipknot is really not so good...if you want NU METAL, try korn, coal chamber and deftones....
0743297334|5.0|I was almost unable to sleep before I got this book in the mail after reading the fictionalized account of Hemingway and his first wife in Paris during the  time he wrote this acclaimed novel.<br /><br />This time when I read this entertaining book by one of my favorite authors, I looked for other things.  What I took away was how very strong simple words, chosen carefully, can more strongly make the point.<br /><br />Because books have always been such a big part of my life, maybe I do believe everything I read but it is hard to read A Paris Wife and then read The Sun Also Rises and not hear Hemingway's voice and soul in both and believe that is the way it really happened.  And you cannot help but have a lot of sympathy for Hedley and any woman with whom he was involved.  Amazing that such a complicated person can write in such a clear way, never using adjectives to say what the noun portrays.
B008XG1X18|1.0|the app works maybe 10% of the time on my kindle fire and otherwise just doesn't open at all. no good.
0747593779|5.0|Because I had enjoyed The Kiterunner so much, of course I had to read \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" and purchased it as soon as I found out it was available.  I was not expecting it to be so splendid.  Why?  Well, a man was writing the book, seen through the eyes of two women, plus the man was from that culture and I had not seen a lot to make me think men from that culture even stopped to consider the women and their feelings.  Just amazing and very touching.  This book tugs at you in much the same way as \\"Kiterunner.\\"<br /><br />The second reason I was not expecting too much is that my experience has been that many authors lose something after their first success.  Take for instance, John Grisham.  While I have read everything he has written, nothing has been as good, in my opinion, as \\"The Firm.\\"<br /><br />Not so with this book.  I think it surpasses \\"Kiterunner\\" but that may be because I am a female.<br /><br />As one reviewer put it, \\"Little did I realize how far and how deep I would travel with this novel. A brilliantly written piece that leaves me in awe of the written word. The story and insufferable details are not for the faint of heart. At times I did the equivalent of squinting my eyes at watching a horror and I skimmed as I read, not because I didn't want to read but because I was afraid to feel too much of the very real pain presented before me. Yes, I was a coward. Nonetheless, the characters and their tale were not and they were impossible to leave once you stood by their lives for a mere moment.\\" I could never say it better.<br /><br />I would love to see Husseini take this a step further and write about modern Afghanistan.  Is life any less terrifying now? Are women treated any better?  And the different people, do they treat each other any better now?  Do they still stone people to death with little reason?<br /><br />This book should be read by anyone who wants to better understand Afghanistan and its people, the atrocities people must live with and the style and grace of these people with so little and so much hardship.  How little it takes to make them happy.  And how easy it is for many of them to forgive the unforgiveable.<br /><br />This is not a book to read if you are depressed and looking for something to lift your spirits.  This book lifts your awareness.<br /><br />As with all my books, I have a policy of \\"pass it on.\\" I give them to anyone who promises to give it to someone else.  This is one book I wish I had kept.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|It is gripping. An adult film, not for little ones.  The two main characters play off each other well.  The Joker is more life like and less comic book than the one as Jack Nicholson played it.  Both were great, but played entirely from a different point of view.  Bat Man was also more real world with technology at his disposal to do things mere mortals could not.  Overall very good entertainment.  I will not spoil the ending!
B00422LESO|5.0|Like the books and movies this novel takes its cue from, it builds up the romance in such a proper way. Stolen glances, witty conversations...all leading up to that final kiss. You know the one, at the end of pride and prejudice where Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy finally (FINALLY!!!) kiss? The kiss that has your heart in your throat and your stomach in your toes?<br /><br />Well this book succeeds in recreating that emotion, that longing for a character to find true love, while making you laugh at the same time. Love it, and will be checking out more from this author in the future.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love this game. new awards kinda sucked since I beat the whole game already. but I love to try to get better times.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|In preparing myself for Bob Dylan's new album Tempest, I decided to re-run all his albums from Good As I've Been To You thru the present.  Among other reasons, it helped display a consistency of standard throughout, a development into the present and a way to tune my hearing towards how Bob's voice is gradually aging.  He's meticulous in how he chooses to use his voice as an instrument, well weathered and a bit rough hewn, a cross in approach between Howlin' Wolf, Pee Wee Russell's clarinet style and a midnight movie that takes place amid the cigar smoke and cognac of a leather backed lounge in black satin.  Setting the placemat, we move forward:<br /><br />First off, it is well commented how much death and carnage is displayed on this album.  It starts off somewhat lighthearted and overtured in a quiet bit of western swing and then..WHAM!  Into the dark undertones of Duquesne Whistle and the train is on one heckuva ride.  A David Lynch style of a train tribute blues as backed up by the video...and we're off on a journey that takes us into dark corners of Scarlet Town, the atmosphere after Midnight, a bad romance that would leave Gaga quaking in her boots, nattily dressed Roman Kings that could be vampiric, mafioso, a combination thereof or just working for the Union.  The country has an icon burning, a lover's trio is cut up and entombed....and Desolation Row becomes a quaint country lane.  I have to admit that the title track of Titanic Tempestuation left me feeling lighthearted and feeling I was in an Irish pub where the Guinness pints were flowing freely and Gordon Lightfoot was off taking notes in a shade of humility.  I enjoyed the scenescape thoroughly at the underlying overlying but not necessarily outright lying metaphors and the script they were playing from at work.  That's part of the key....the song is almost like Bob Dylan's production of how he'd want a movie of the story to go...and why not?  Everyone else including James Cameron has done so, so whynot Bob?  As far as I know, he's the only major music artist to tackle the ship's story on its centennial.<br /><br />The closer and elegaic tribute to John Lennon was heartfelt and not maudlin and has brought a knot to my throat on each listen thus far.  It is Bob at his most vulnerable and personal side, which isn't something a lot of people know what to do with.  It is in keeping with the rest of the album and I vehemently disagree with all those who say the last two tracks kill the album.  Sometimes things take 32 years to process, sometimes a 100,...sometimes 11 or various cominations within.  Go figure Bob would take it upon himself on the 100th Anniversary of the fated White Star Liner to include his own particularly unique take on the saga and release the collection of songs on the 11th anniversary of another horrific day in our current timeline.<br /><br />Scarlet Town sounds like a well hewn folk song....amazing.  Tin Angel too....the story is horrifying in a way and it is almost a relief when Bob with a smile in his voice starts to regale the tale of the Titanic.....as I said, think Irish pub.  There's a lot in this that is midnight music...to be sure.  Roll On John could be playing over the closing credits to this CD, or being done at a dimly lit piano with a smoky haze.  It all fits and regarding the length of the song Tempest...if Cameron can do a 3 hour story on the Titanic, a 15 minute song is right on par with it all, metaphorically and otherwise.  Great album and well played overall.  Kudos to the keyboard work by Bob on either piano or organ on the bulk of the album.<br /><br />One last comment...I found it interesting that Bob in interviews mentioned his original impetus to do a religious album...and that does surface...not obviously, but thoroughly throughout too....and on almost every song, even if some of it is the darker aspect of spirituality and consequences therein.  Lots of layers, but it is Dylan, so....you get more to chew on with eachpass...and that's what makes it fun.  :)<br /><br />An amazing if dark toned odyssey....and I wish Bob many more years, many more albums and the enjoyment of the gift of his time to us....and kudos on the great band he's been honing as well.  Bravo!
0385344333|1.0|the once great reacher may have reached the bottom. this is a very bad read. reacher is a chatty fellow on a much too long car ride in the middle of nowhere. the middle of nowhere is where lee child wants our hero to be. just another bad book in a long string of them.
B008W12UQG|3.0|I kind of bought this reluctantly based off of the reviews... But all in all this is one of my favorites from Kiss and I think the remastering sounds great. The only really noticeable flaw that hits me every time is on the intro to Flaming Youth, which sounds like a hiccup??? Other than that sounds great cranked up in the car! The extra guitar solo on Sweet Pain is really nothing to get excited about either ;)

1572816295|5.0|I can actually read these cards. I know everybody experiences the cards differently. But I have several decks that I've been collecting for 25 years, Including the RWS deck. But no deck I have speaks to me like this deck.<br /><br />The figures are very expressive, and while it follows closely the RWS ideas, it doesn't contain the mystical symbols of the RWS beyond the most obvious.<br /><br />Still, I am able to weave a story with this deck that I've always struggled with in the past.<br /><br />I am very excited that it's clicking for me, finally, and this deck has everything to do with it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely love the series! I've read them twice already! It one of the books that once you start reading you just can't place it down.  EL James did a remarkable job with this series
B008YRVW0I|2.0|Thought I would love fishdom, as I enjoy playing it on my pc, but the figures are so small that I can barely see them.  I am old and tired and do not like having to work at playing games, so I was disappointed with fishdom.

B003C5FMEE|5.0|If you enjoy music where people actually play instruments and sing without auto-tune, then boy do I have an album for you. This one is amazing. Backatown is a great song but I have the most fun listening to Hurricane Season, Something Beautiful is unexpected but is heartfelt and shows the range they have.<br /><br />I don't usually write reviews, but felt I had to on this one, and I have great taste, so if you get this album and don't like it then you know your taste is lacking. Get back in the gym and work on your taste.
0425263908|1.0|Been there, read that! Just finished the Fifty Shades trilogy and now I feel like I'm reading a cheap purse knock-off. Granted, I have a few mild criticisms for Fifty, but at least it had some fun music and literature references to accompany all the sex.  This book doesn't seem to have anything going for it other than imitation being a sincere form of flattery.  In all fairness, I should check to see who published first, but it really  doesn't matter because I'm one-quarter way through and done.  Hmm, I just noticed even the covers are similar!
0385738773|4.0|I thought that The Death Cure was a very nice conclusion to the trilogy. The ending was a little far-fetched, but it seemed almost plausible that there was an emergency back-up plan in case WICKED's plot to fix overpopulation backfired and killed everyone.<br /><br />I felt bad for Tom for pretty much the entire novel. He can never catch a break, and I'm pretty sure every bad thing that could happen to a person happened to him.<br /><br />Although all of the characters were pretty well developed from the first two novels, I think Minho and Tom have continued to grow. And characters like Brenda and Jorge who were introduced in The Scorch Trials were also given more depth and had more of an active role. Who would have guessed that they were agents of WICKED? Well, probably everyone but me, but that's besides the point. Everything is WICKED's fault and doing. They're worse than Big Brother.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely give this book a 4/5. I would, and have, recommend this series to any fans of dystopian YA novels, and I'm actually looking forward to the prequel coming out within the next year or so. I'm also pretty sure these books would make an epic movie series.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I have to admit I was hesitant about buying this trilogy after hearing that it was about kinky sex.  WelL that was an understatement in my very limited knowledge of such things but I wanted to see what the hype was all about and went the whole hog and bought the 3 books at once.  Yes at first it was  bit daunting but I as I always do with books and movies I always try to figure out out ahead of time what the ending will be so I just had to keep reading and I could not put it down once I realised there was a story there - a romance born from a very strange beginning but a romance it was and I did fairly well  predicting the ending but it didn't stop me from wanting more.  I simply did not want it to end and was disappointed when it did although there was probably nowhere left to go. I have read some of the other reviews and I think some were rather harsh but everybody expects something different from a book. LOVED IT.
0312641893|5.0|I apologize in advance for any and all spoilers.<br /><br />First and foremost, this book exceeded all of my expectations. And that's really saying something, because I had super high expectations for Cinder. Amazon definitely didn't fail me in recommending this novel.<br /><br />I really don't have the words to describe how absolutely wonderful this novel was. The plot, although loosely centered around the Cinderella fairy tale, has so many other twists and turns that Cinder becomes so much more than just another Cinderella. Other than Cinder being a cyborg, Meyer also introduces a ruthless queen from a nation based on the moon, a devastating worldwide plague, a handsome prince who has to cope with the loss of his father while taking on the role of Emperor, and a missing moon princess who everyone believes to have been killed years before.<br /><br />Seriously hardcore.<br /><br />Oh, and of course Cinder has the crazy step-mother and step-sister who hate her. And the one step-sister who loves her is killed by the plague. And her only friend, Iko the android, gets sold for parts. And even though the prince falls in love with her, she can't be with him because 1) he doesn't know she's Cyborg and 2) even if he could get over the whole cyborg thing, she's also Lunar. And since the Lunars can mind-control people, he feels he can't trust her once he finds out what she really is. Or, at least 2/3 of what she really is. Because not only is she Lunar, but she also happens to be the missing Lunar princess.<br /><br />The only real gripe I had was that it was pretty obvious from the first 75-100 pages that Cinder was the missing princess. But really, I think that all the hints at that just make it even better. The reader realizes before Cinder does who she really is, and everything she does and realizes just makes the reader more restless for her to find out her real past. Which she doesn't until like the last 5 pages.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the rest of The Lunar Chronicles to be published, and I really hope Marissa Meyer writes many more books. I'll read all of them. As soon as they come out. I give this a 5/5, and would definitely call it one of my favorite books ever. It's definitely the best YA book I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Go buy Cinder. Now. And then read it.icles to be published, and I really hope Marissa Meyer writes many more books. I'll read all of them. As soon as they come out. I give this a 5/5, and would definitely call it one of my favorite books ever. It's definitely the best YA book I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Go buy Cinder. Now. And then read it.
0307742539|5.0|The book arrived just fine, and while I've only just started reading this third book and am only some 100+ pages into the Millenium Trilogy, it's proving to be just as exciting as the first two books and the Swedish extended version of the movie with English subtitles.<br /><br />I highly recommend this third book (and the first two books and the Swedish extended version of the movies).<br /><br />It's too bad Steig Larsson didn't live to see what a success his books have become.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I honestly made no idea what this movie was going to be like going in, I just saw a bunch of hot guys taking their shirts off (and as shallow as I am it was good enough for me). I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it had a good plot, amazing comedic performances from Channing and Mathew, not to mention hot guys taking their shirts off! This was a pleasant surprise for me and this movie made my summer!
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Some of the songs are amazing and I listen over and over. Then there are also songs that I skip everytime. Though all around I love Lana del ray and this album.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|As a 90s kids I missed a lot of the shows I grew up with as a kid, but having one of my favorite shows on DVD brings me a blast from the past. I know that the original music was cut, but you don't really know what's missing unless you look for it. Regardless, it was an awesome set with the complete series plus the movies and it was a purchase I was glad I made!
B000GIWRIY|5.0|I've been a Tull fan since \\"Benefit\\" days and followed them through thick and thin. When their recording output increased in the 90's, I was overjoyed. But when \\"Roots to Branches\\" first came out, I'll admit to be being unimpressed with their past couple releases. I probably played this CD only a few times before sticking it at the end of my JT CD collection. I'll admit that I only listened to it in the car and never in its entirety at home. Recently, I was in the mood for some Tull and picked this out, knowing that I hadn't paid much attention to it. What a mistake I'd made! This is classic Tull, not something that sounds like an Ian Anderson solo project (not that there's anything wrong with that). The flute work is abundant and some of the best IA had done since the \\"Songs from the Wood\\" and \\"Heavy Horses\\" era. His lyrics are generally among the most melancholy in the Tull catalogue but wonderfully considered and with the sharp wit of IA at his best. The rest of the band is energetic, cohesive, and interested in what they're playing.<br /><br />Although they would go on to record one more studio CD, the fun but not especially challenging \\"j-tull.com,\\" this penultimate effort deserves a place among Tull's best. I urge you to reconsider this CD. It is just a joy to listen.
B005LAII94|3.0|I was majorly disappointed in this film, mostly because I read the novel and came into this with BIG expectations. Unfortunately my expectations weren't met and what I got was a huge flop of a film. Stone cut out a lot of key story sequences and good dialogue, and took away a lot of the action and a lot of characters. The only thing that translated from story to screen (which made the film a little more tolerable) was Chon and Ben. I loved Kitsch and Johnson in these roles and their bromance translate well to me...unfortunately the rest of it didn't
B0086449YA|5.0|I wish Amazon would delete reviews that have nothing to do with the music. This isn't the place to rant about Amazon's selling policies/mistakes.<br /><br />I like most everything Mark Knopfler has done but this is one of the best albums he has released...period.<br /><br />Few artists create double albums that couldn't be stripped down to make a superior single one. This is one of the rare exceptions. Repeated listening proves every song a keeper. Just beautiful...do yourself a favour and buy it.
B005LAII3A|4.0|I honestly can't say that I'm disappointed because I really didn't have any expectations of this film going in. They set this up as the poor man's Inception only with a lot less plot and a lot more ass kicking. The plot was slightly above average and became a little redundant at one point but Len Wiseman's slick style seem to pick up the slack a bit.
B001E780W8|2.0|I like Slipknot & Stone Sour and I don't mind if the sounds overlap and blend. This album just doesn't deliver, anything. It has a few ok singles on it, but the rest seems like white noise. I bought & downloaded this album right before I went to lift and just did not get a pump off of it.<br /><br />Pros: Snuff & Psychosocial (but you knew that)<br /><br />Cons: Rest of album
B005LAIIPS|3.0|There's no question that this isn't nearly as sleek as the original Bourne movies which optimized on minimum plot and maximum ass kicking. Legacy tries to follow suit but suffers from a mix of over-reaching, failed execution, and a convoluted plot. Jeremy Renner is without a doubt sexy as hell but even he couldn't carry this sub par installment. I thought that this was going to be a kind of domino effect/fall out of what happened with Jason Bourne, unfortunately it felt like two different stories being told at the same time and neither one of them is very good. Nothing is really gained from the events of this movie so it felt like a total and complete waste of time. I know they're setting up for a new franchise but that ending was possibly one of the worst endings I've ever seen.
0345803493|5.0|This trilogy is amazing. You become so attachted to the characters. The books are nothing like I expected them to be at all. I recomend it to any adult woman who loves romance, lust, and adventure.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I'll be the first to admit I'm not the biggest fan of Seth McFarlene, but this movie completely changed all of that. It was full of dirty joke, potty humor, and a little bit of childhood imagination. That mixed with the comedic performances from Mark Wahlburg and Mila Kunis made this movie a complete stand out that had me rolling on the floor laughing.
B00026WU4G|4.0|Because this CD came out after 3 overtly Christian, bible-thumpin' releases in a row, many former fans avoided \\"Infidels\\" with understandable fear, & critics gave it a wary thumbs up. It is actually, with \\"Oh Mercy\\", Dylan's strongest '80's work (not counting the tour w/ Tom Petty & Heartbreakers on VHS/DVD).<br /><br />\\"Jokerman\\" is a flat-out masterpiece that rates amongst his best songs. \\"Sweetheart\\" has excellent lyrics & vocal phrasing beneath the seeming banal title. \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" may or may not have a daft message, but it rocks like the Stones at their best (thanks Mick Taylor). \\"License to Kill\\" has an elegant melody & mood. Then there are 2 weak songs to skip, followed by the mystical \\"I & I\\" which may be profound or gibberish, but sounds great with Knopfler on guitar. \\"Don't Fall Apart on Me\\" has a classic Dylan descending chord change and an impassioned vocal.<br /><br />Yes, the snare drum sounds weird, but it is the '80's. Most '60's legends sounded horrible in the '80's. McCartney, Winwood, Clapton, The Stones after \\"Tattoo You\\" did disastrous work that only sounds worse in retrospect. And yes, Dylan was unaware by this point what his best work/songs were, so \\"Infidels\\" & \\"Oh Mercy\\" could have been stronger or longer w/ left-off songs. Still, how many modern songwriters can go from romantic to political to spiritual to personal in one song? Probably only Dylan at his best.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Not bad for a movie that was inspired solely by a board game, the trick is to take the movie for what it is and not expect some grand master movie. The movie is kind of what would happen if Riggins (Kitsch's character on Friday Night Light) spiraled out of Texas, joined the navy and saved the world. Decent plot, hit and miss dialogue but I didn't regret paying to see the movie. The one thing I wished they had left out was when they were actually playing Battleship in the movie. That paradox only works in Inception...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have all my notes available on my computer, laptop, phone, etc  and they all stay in sync. I create shopping lists and then they are on my phone waiting the next time I go shopping.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't get past Kristen Stewart's awful acting and the substandard plot. Chris Hensworth manages to carry a good deal of the movie but he couldn't carry a crazy script and an unlikeable leading lady. It was visually stunning but the rest fell short in execution. This movie bit off more than it could chew and suffered greatly for it.
B003Y1TC56|5.0|I just finished my first listen through of \\"The Reckoning\\" and I am now left sitting in a gentler place. Don't get me wrong, these guys can rock and roll. But, still, I am left in awe of the raw emotion radiating out from this album. The vocals steal the show in every track. A few times throughout the album he will really belt out or get creative with his vocalizations. I found some of these \\"vocal displays\\" to be praise-worthy and others not to be.<br /><br />I am going to be making a point to see them live next year. Now, I have to go listen through their other albums. It was that good!
B00866H7SS|4.0|I found this book refreshing from 50 Shades of Grey (even thought I did read all three) in that I enjoyed the slow build-up to the development leading characters and the leading lady is no damsel in distress here! Thank goodness! Gideon Cross could a force to be reckoned with. Their love scenes were hot and steamy and the ending of the book left me hanging with bated breath for the next! Why do authors do this! I just don't know! Well written! Next one is on pre-order! October can't come  fast enough!
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Mark has done it again, a wonderfully accurate depiction of computer espionage all wrapped up into one of the best books of the year.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The quell series is a work of art.  The backgrounds are beautiful,  the music is peaceful,  and the game play is relaxing in early levels and challenging in later ones. 5 stars for both Quell and Quell Reflect.
B00846REIS|4.0|I only have about 50% of this novel done ,but I do like it. It's interesting and erotic. Not as intriguing as Mr Gray in the novel 50 Shades of Gray, but never the less I have a hard time putting it down. Although I have not finish the book I would recommend it as a good read!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|technique, a la wallace & grommit and/or rudolph the red nosed reindeer.  There is a slow quality, simple and well appreciated by me.  It is almost a lost art to produce a movie warm, sweet but not diabetic. Adult and child can enjoy.  Not everything has to be a punch in the face, remember, tickling with a feather can produce laughs too.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|the game just never ends at all. wave after wave you get more stuff to spend or us to your likingness.
B002AFX52S|3.0|The film is what it is and other reviewers have done an excellent job in reviewing why this story is worth telling. I bought the blu-ray version hoping that it would give new life to the 1980 film, which I saw in the theater when it was originally released. But blu-ray cannot make the print more than the print. The graininess is played up by blu-ray enough that it is distracting. The print that Criterion worked from shows its limitations.<br /><br />No need to get the blu-ray, if HD quality is the goal. Given the quality of the film print, the DVD transfer is sufficient.<br /><br />I wish it were otherwise.

B0061PEAUY|4.0|As usual Kathy Reichs writes a very good mystery novel full of other informative information.  I've read all her books.
034580404X|5.0|After hearing the comments about the graphic sexual content of this book, I was curious about it but unsure how it would measure up to some of the other books I have read in this genre.  A friend encouraged me to give them a try and I jumped in for what I thought would be a quick and easy read.  The first book introduces the reader to the two main characters and uses some very detailed scenes to paint the picture of the world they live in.  It was extremely entertaining seeing the back and forth interactions between the innocent Anastasia and the worldly Christian.  By the end of the first book I found myself hoping for a fairytale ending for the two of them.<br /><br />Books two and three brings the reader into the depths of the world of Christian Grey.  There is a wonderful exploration into his background and the changes he goes through in his quest to find his way with Anastasia.  It was interesting that the sexual content took a backseat to the emotional journey that the characters went through from book to book.  The introduction of past lovers and the dramas that unfold as a result of their arrival helps move the story forward and offers a totally different view of Christian.<br /><br />I found the most pleasure in the story of the two lovers and the slow revelation of what had influenced Christian's views on love and sex.  A total surprise was at the end of the third book when the reader is shown what the first meeting with Anastasia looked like from his view.  That small taste of what he was thinking from the first, really made me want to read more of what he was thinking along the way.<br /><br />All in all, the story is a good one if the sexual content does not bother you. If you are looking for well written bondage or slave based sexual reading, \\"The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy\\" by A. N. Roquelaure (Anne Rice) is a much more erotic choice.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved every minute I spent reading all 3 of these books!! It is so much more than a book about sex. The story itself... Its dramatic, funny, heart racing and heart stopping! I will definitely read again.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have always loved Jack Reacher books. I could hardly wait for the latest one. I ordered it before it was released. What a great big dud. I didn't even finished it. What a waste of money.
B0085Z3B2Q|2.0|I had expected a lot from this movie based on the trailer. While the graphics were great the delivery was not. It would have been better if they spent more time on the story and dialogue and less on the cheesy songs that filled the entire movie. Even my 9 year old twin nephews couldn't handle it. The saving grace was the message it was trying to get across was a good one.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|Just had to write after reading another poster saying not so kind things about this magificent restoration Universal has done on this great classic. We must realize this film was released in 1950 and will not look as good as today's big digitally filmed movies. Home video has given us many formats to view this film. And that's what this blu ray looks like: film. Grain and all. I love that Universal avoids Digital Noise Reduction (or very little use) to remove film grain and detail from their classics for blu ray. These movies should look like film and NOT video. With the little grain in tact and the awesome detail in this 1080p picture. Don't believe it when reviewers say this looks like DVD upconverted. This blu ray blows away the DVD and any other medium this film has seen over the years. I am glad that Universal released this on blu ray and not just DVD. This classic compliments Universal's 100th Anniversary. Would love to see them release more older classics like this and restoring them to the brilliance as HARVEY. This is one detailed picture! We must look past the film grain and enjoy the beauty of this transfer.<br />I just felt I needed to defend this great looking blu ray before the picky viewers pick apart the problems with this transfer. Nothing here to complain about! Except they don't make great clean comedies like this anymore.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I absolutely love playing this for hours on end, and unlike other games which require farming, this one isn't that much of a grind.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the game decided to randomly remove one of the gadgets I purchased. It even says I purchased in the history, but in the store I need to repurchase to use it... Finish this could be fixed.
B005CFWM22|5.0|It took me a little while to decide whether to purchase these sandals or not, but now I am so glad I got them. I have a few foot problems to deal with, and oftentimes end up with misgivings after buying and wearing even some expensive \\"comfort\\" shoes.<br />I have worn these sandals all day, without any resulting aches or pains or fatigue - they are that comfortable!!  The design is perfect, the fit gives the illusion of almost going barefoot with the light straps and bouncy sole, and the Khaki/Espresso color goes with just about anything I wear - definitely works for me!<br />It certainly is one of the best purchases I have made at Amazon.com.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have a 2009 Nissan Murano with factory iPod integration.  I also use Otterbox cases on all devices.  Music plays perfectly from the Apple devices, but the devices do not charge, and I have to remove the Otterbox case to allow the Nissan plug to fit .<br /><br />This charge converter/adapter fixed both of my problems! I spent a little more than I wanted to on this adapter, but the hassle it saved and functionality it provides makes it well worth every penny.
B008ETOSYI|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie on my iPad, I enjoy everything  I get from AmaOn.  They are very fair in price.  I shop on Amazon  every chance I get.

1439127700|5.0|This is a very readable book book.From Truman's reaching out to Hoover,to Nixon's still doing unlawful things after his presidency.I would say to anyone who enjoys modern American history,read this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Its about time!! Love it &amp; addicted to it!! So glad they finally made an app for the Kindle users. This is pretty much the only app I use &amp; love daily!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought the plot of this book was very interesting but felt it was a little dragged out and didn't care for the ending.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I like the puzzles and feel that they are challenging enough but I'm on one now that's driving me nuts and I'm  almost out of time. (you get an allotted amount of time to finish 7-8 puzzles in a chapter) From what the reviews say Ill have to do all of the puzzles over in that chapter if I run out of time.  Not happy about that but otherwise this game is fun and challenging and works great on my Kindle Fire.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|I love the TV series. That said, it took me a minute to change the characters in my head, but once that was done, I though it was a lively plot and a fun read.

0439023521|2.0|Let me just state that I'm not saying that the book or the writing style was bad but... Battle Royale came out before and it was much better, more tightly plotted and it left me feeling what this book was unable to make me feel which was sad and angry.<br />In this case I completely blame Katniss for this little hicup.<br />Katniss as a the main character was dull, cold, prickly, not engaging... I kept scratching my head going 'why does Peeta or even Gale like her?'. I kept wondering why her? Why this girl who by her own admition was only made to stand out by Peeta and the help of her stylist the one that ignited rebelion? As a main character Katniss just lacked that something that made you want to root for her or even become attached to her. I mean in the beginning you never find out why people from district 12 were attached to her... she hunted? Definately not because of her warm and inviting personality because she didn't have one.<br />Then there was Katniss' undue angst over her non-existant love life. I mean she's killing people or running for her life and she's wondering 'Peeta or Gale?' or feeling guilty because of her developing feelings for Peeta because of her friendship with Gale because Gale has feelings for her that she doesn't share... Right, because when I'm killing people or watching other people be butcher I'm going to have moments where I feel all conflicted about who in my so cliche love triangle I should choose. It made me want to hurl. Why does every book that comes out now have to have a love triangle in the first place? Come on the concept that a person could be so very indecisive as to not 'know' which person they have feelings for is just annoying. Then add to the fact that the two mem (why is it always men by the way? I find the concept sexist that pretty much all the love triangles out there consist of the male characters waiting with baited breath going 'pick me!'.)are just hoping against hope that the women will turn their fickle affection toward them... again barf.<br />I have to say that there was also the characters self absorption, everything from the first book to the last was about oh you guessed it Katniss. She never looks beyond herself and what she's lost and her own pain.<br />It's been a while since I've disliked a main character this much.<br />On the whole the plot wasn't bad just something I've read before, the world the writer created was interesting but nothing out of the ordinary.<br />On the whole this book was just that so ordinary it was unremarkable.
1612183956|5.0|Our narrative begins with a man regaining consciousness near the river. He has no idea who he is, or where he is. His conscious being tells him he is hurting, his eye is virtually closed and he has acute pain on his side and back. With every step he tries to take he finds excruciating pain. Next when he finds himself back in the infirmary, he finally recalls more detail of whom he is and why he is where he is. He is Ethan Burke, and he works for the secret service and he is searching for some missing co-workers. He finds the town he is in `a little off', where the inhabitants are less than normal and as events begins to transpire and disentangle he comes to the realisation that he must escape from town of Wayward Pines and do so quickly.<br /><br />From the first time we meet Ethan, on the page, the pace is fast with no real let up. The narrative gives little `breathing space' for Ethan as he is constantly on move. The mantra here is move or die. The plot gives nothing away and there seems to be little the reader can piece together, in advance to give any hint of a possible outcome, until of course author wants you to know what's happening. The end was, not predictable but rather surprising and all in all it tied all the plot themes together nicely.<br /><br />A very good read, which is well written with a heavy `dollop' of thriller/suspense, non-stop action and a not too healthy serving of blood spilled with chaos and carnage served on the side. Anyone for apple pie?

B001GCUO5M|1.0|Once you see the ending of this film, there is absolutely no reason to watch it again.  The dumbest plot since \\"Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis.\\"  A complete let-down.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good book, can't wait to read book two!! Hopefully in book two we get to know Christian better, he's so mysterious. But maybe that is what makes him so yummy!!!
0446547646|1.0|The best part of this book was the paper it is printed on. For those who value their reading time, take a pass.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Have to admit I had second thoughts about watching this series.  But my daughter raved about it.  Now I'm hooked on it.  I really enjoy the dry English humor and I think the acting is superb.  The wardrobe and customs of the time bring you back to a wonderful time in history.  Maggie Smith is a hoot and wonderful actress as usual.  Looking forward to the next series!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love this app, after 1 day I was completely addicted! it had anything and everything you are looking for!
B003L77GG0|5.0|It's been a long ride... and Clark has finally earned his tights, boots and cape! The world is ready for Superman, and Clark is ready for the huge undertaking this represents. We got to grow with young Kal-El, we went hand in hand through ten years of trials and new abilities... and finally he has come unto himself: A gorgeous reporter witha nerdy hairstyle and thick Buddy Holly glasses, a mild stutter... and oodles of charisma to go with it all. We enjoy the image of a mature superhero in his late twenties, at peace and in love... and fighting the greatest evil in the universe as a final rite of passage. Clark is no longer the Blur... he is the Man of Steel!<br />This season has some awsome drama, unexpected turns, memories of the past, high school flashbacks, two weddings, love, sex, villains and heroes... and the very anticipated return of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) to consolidate himself as superman's greatest adversary in the future. And of course.... flying.<br />Made ME fly. A great way to end an epic series!
030758836X|5.0|I purchased this book based on a really nice review in our local paper. Sitting in a coffee shop one day with this book, a woman walked up to me and was anxious to learn how I liked it, saying that she has read every Gillian Flynn book, and thought this one was her absolute best work. While it took me a while (maybe 40 pages) to get into the book, once there I couldn't put it down. I told my husband that he needed to read it (not really his \\"type\\" of book - I worried that he might think of it as chick lit) he had the same reaction. \\"These are scary people!\\" he commented. If you are looking for a real page turner that might have you glancing at your spouse in a different way, this is it!
B008TMOIEK|5.0|I love this album! I spent so much time searching for all the songs and now they're all here in one album. The description about the music choice featured in the booklet was also very interesting and gave insight as to why classical music was featured in Fifty Shades. Overall, it shows that EL James is a well rounded author to be able to give context to her books, i.e. music and literature references.

0345803485|2.0|I am not much into BDSM reads, I really just decided to read this book because of the media buzz about it and wanted to see if it was any good myself. Also, to see if there was really any story line behind it rather than just sex. Barely. The main character jumped back and forth about what she is exactly. She barely kept a hold on her own personality, and I'm being generous when I say barely. A lot of the thoughts Ana had were just ridiculous and out of character. She really didn't even know who she was. Honestly, the only characters I liked out of the book were Kate, Eliot, and Jose. They actually seemed the same character throughout the whole book. That could be because the book wasn't written in third person. Ana just annoyed me to death. I couldn't stand her. She didn't have a backbone, she relied too much on Christian and what he thought. Christian had his moments of being okay and then back to being the dick I kind of hoped got into some sort of burglary and got shot just so the book would be over. I read half of the book and by then I was really annoyed with it and didn't continue for another two months. I just wanted to finish it hoping it would be better or just so I would know how it ends at the very least. The book was really deprived of character development. Instead of having that, it just had Ana jumping back and forth barely having her own opinions, and when she actually did stand up to him I was glad, but surprised because based on her dependence on him I never would have thought she would ever speak her mind. She is basically like nine different people throughout the book. The sex scenes were actually annoying so I skipped through basically all of them. A large reason the sex scenes were just unbearable is because I had to hear about her retarded inner goddess. I thought I was going to kill myself before ever finishing the book! If the book was actually decent, it would have lost like 30 points due to that annoying  recurring childish inner voice. Reading about her inner goddess and her subconscious I wanted to take a power drill to my eyes! I expected more out of this book; especially because of its popularity, but really, it was just a waste of my time.

B005HEU1Q2|5.0|The last 3 minutes of this episode could be a whole other episode in itself. Most of the episode moves through the crew's actions and though processes slowly and patiently, and then (after the conflict is resolved) springs this sort of mind-blowing aside at the end. Will probably watch this episode a few more times without getting tired of it!

030758836X|4.0|Lies.<br /><br />What are the lies we tell ourselves? What are the lies we tell others? Which ones are we aware of, and which ones don't we know about until it's too late?<br /><br />This book kept me at the edge of my seat-and it's rare that I can't figure out the drift of a story pretty early on. The story twists and turns in ways that are sometimes expected, and sometimes not at all.<br /><br />Any reader of mysteries, thrillers or even general fiction will find her interest piqued.<br /><br />Nick is married to beautiful and wealthy Amy, heir to a series of childhood books named after her. After they both lose their New York jobs, they move to Nick's childhood town along the Mississippi river. And the day of their 5th anniversary, Amy disappears.<br /><br />Where is she? Is she still even alive? As the police's suspicion falls more and more on Nick, and the evidence starts piling against him, he needs to prove that he is innocent. But how do you prove the unprovable?<br /><br />\\"I could feel her girl-brain buzzing, turning Amy's disappearance into a frothy, scandalous romance, ignoring any reality that didn't suit the narrative.\\"<br /><br />Gone Girl is a story of broken love, and the lies that keep it together despite the anger, the resentment and the desire for vengeance. It's a story of the consequences of financial and emotional dependence and manipulation. It tells us a (rather bleak) tale of the lengths some people are willing to go to get revenge, and of what people are willing to accept in order to maintain appearances. Because in this book, appearances are everything. Can someonebe a killer simply because he looks like one? Is there anything beyond the plastic surface we present to the media, the idealized version of ourselves we present to others?<br /><br />In other words, are we ever anything more than skin-deep?<br /><br />\\"You'd literally lie, cheat, and steal -- hell, kill -- to convince people that you are a good guy,\\" Go once said. ... I lost my appetite because it was so completely true and I'd never realized it, and even as she was saying it, I thought: I will never forget this, this is one of those moments that will be lodged in my brain forever.\\"<br /><br />It's interesting that both main characters are writers-they know how to play with words and how to use them to their advantage. In this book, words are slimy and slippery. The foundation of language that we have been taught to trust can lead you astray or even collapse right under your feet. They built their life through words, and when these words no longer serve them, their whole life falls apart. And they try to rebuilt it through words, again, but the building is only a shadow of its original, a mere façade that hides the emptiness inside.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn wrote a rare masterful novel, one that went, I think, far beyond the simple thriller story. It was not only entertaining, but also deep and thoughtful. There's no easy way out of the book, and it will leave you shaking and reflecting for a while... is the person you love really who he or she says she is? Are you the person you think you are?appetite because it was so completely true and I'd never realized it, and even as she was saying it, I thought: I will never forget this, this is one of those moments that will be lodged in my brain forever.\\"<br /><br />It's interesting that both main characters are writers-they know how to play with words and how to use them to their advantage.

B008LZHA3G|3.0|Dylan's way with words continues to astound: remarkably vivid storytelling, compelling imagery, and multifaceted prose. However, for those of us who remember Dylan delivering exciting music that propelled his words, this package lacks that facet. At the risk of sounding snide, this collection reminds me of old '50's Beat poetry set to music, with the poet pontificating on top of ordinary jazzy (or in this case, rootsy) vamps. Don't get me wrong, if you're a fan, this is good stuff, but i can't help but miss when the music contained on a Dylan album wasn't just a facade for Bob to hang his lyrics on. His band is capable of delivering earth-shaking and goose-bump making music, but on \\"Tempest\\" they're constrainted to making aural-mood-wallpaper. Am I asking too much? I don't think so. Go back and listen to \\"Desire\\" when Bob's band challenged him, effectively saying, \\"Yeah, you're Bob Dylan. So what? Can you keep up when we rock?\\" Yeah, I know, he's a god, and everybody better step back and genuflect. but c'mon, it's still rock 'n' roll. Bob. At least give somebody a guitar solo on yer damn record.!!!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I finally realize why I keep going back to Sony headphones. Price, quality and unbelievable sound. I am so satisfied with this choice. They sound absolutly fantastic. I can leave them on my head for hours and they never feel uncomfortable. Only drawback I can find is the cord. It is way too heavy for the headphones. Sony went a little bit overboard with quality in the cord. Prior to these I owned a set of Bose over the ear noise canceling headphones, and I have to say that those were great. No complaints except for the price. And even though these are not noise canceling, they have every bit the quality as Bose at 1/3 the price. Highly recomended.

Unfortunately for me i hate and i mean hate not finishing a book especially when I've spent over $4 for it. It was like problem after problem it felt never ending. IN my opinion this book is not worth a series ..sorry it isn't, it should have ended here not every story is made to be a series :-( uhhhhh i feel drained and i feel a headache coming on! I have nothing against sylvia day though :-/

B00364K6YW|5.0|The Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice is my all time favorite.  It carries the humor and tone of Austen's book, and even though it doesn't cover every scene in her novel, I believe even JA would approve.  I cannot even tell you how many times I have watched it.  I read the book 4 times.  I never tire of its lighthearted satirization of period manners and romance.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Anyone who thought 2009's uneven \\"Together Through Life\\" showed signs that rock's poetic mastermind was losing his edge as he neared 70 can rest easy now with the release of \\"Tempest,\\" his best work since 2001.<br /><br />The 10 songs on \\"Tempest\\" boast fascinating lyrics, intricate, well played arrangements and a Dylan who, at 71, is at the peak of his interpretive powers, even with his voice undergoing signs of decay. As with \\"Modern Times,\\" most of the songs are dark, with little levity throughout. The opening \\"Duquesne Whistle,\\" with a jumpy swing arrangement taken right out of 1933, and the gorgeous closing John Lennon tribute \\"Roll On, John,\\" offer something close to relief, and even the former track contains images of lowdown women and fear that the titular whistle is \\"gonna tear my world apart.\\" The album's very best songs, \\"Pay in Blood\\" and \\"Tin Angel,\\" are also its darkest. \\"Pay in Blood\\" boasts one of his finest musical accompaniments in years, and the lyrics, which paint Bob as an executioner \\"sworn to uphold the laws of God,\\" are loaded with delicious dark humor. \\"Tin Angel,\\" a nearly 10 minute tale of lust, revenge and murder, is simply astonishing, an accomplishment worthy of the same ranks as \\"Blind Willie McTell,\\" \\"Mississippi,\\" and similarly lauded works from Bob's post-1975 career. \\"Long and Wasted Years\\" is spoke-sung in a manner many compare to 1987's classic \\"Brownsville Girl,\\" and is a bittersweet, endearing ballad, as is \\"Soon After Midnight,\\" which begins tenderly enough but gets progressiveley more vicious, with Dylan vowing to \\"drag his corpse through the mud\\" in regards to a competitor for his heart's object of affection. \\"Narrow Day\\" is a down and dirty shuffle sung with grit, and \\"Scarlet Town\\" is bone chilling with its sparse arrangements and images of despair. \\"Early Roman Kings\\" is a \\"Together Through Life\\" sounding blues shuffle taken from the Muddy Waters handbook, but the lyrics elevate enough, including the biting \\"I ain't afraid to make love to a bitch or a hag.\\"<br /><br />Much anticipation has been given tot he album's nearly 14 minute title track, a blow by blow account of the night the Titanic sank, and it happily is a success; while certainly not an original subject matter or as good an epic as \\"Desolation Row\\" or \\"Visions of Johanna,\\" it's a charming, lilting tribute to the famous event, and Bob draws much sympathy for the characters he envisions on their doomed voyage.<br /><br />\\"Tempest\\" is an essential entry into the Dylan catalog, proof that in his twilight years, he still has a lot to say about the state of our being and where we're headed.d to make love to a bitch or a hag.\\"<br /><br />Much anticipation has been given tot he album's nearly 14 minute title track, a blow by blow account of the night the Titanic sank, and it happily is a success; while certainly not an original subject matter or as good an epic as \\"Desolation Row\\" or \\"Visions of Johanna,\\" it's a charming, lilting tribute to the famous event, and Bob draws much sympathy for the characters he envisions on their doomed voyage.<br /><br />\\"Tempest\\" is an essential entry into the Dylan catalog, proof that in his twilight years, he still has a lot to say about the state of our being and where we're headed.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I can not believe this movie got such poor reviews. the characters were enjoyable the scenery was outstanding!! And now that science is proving that there is ancient city ruins and pyramids on mars makes it more fun..WONDERFUL STORY...can not wait to read the book
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|I just finished watching the first season of PLL and I am hooked! The show follows four high school girls who are being haunted by a mysterious person, \\"A.\\" A year before the show starts, their best friend Alison disappeared suddenly and is presumed dead. Though the girls drift apart the following summer, they are reunited when they start receiving threatening texts and messages from \\"A.\\" He or she seems to know every secret about Alison and the girls, though it's unclear what \\"A\\" wants. While they deal with that central mystery, the girls also struggle with family and relationship issues. My only caveat was that though the girls seem pretty intelligent, sometimes they behave in really idiotic ways when the threat of \\"A\\" is nearby. For example, they don't lock their doors or tell the police when they're being threatened. That seemed a little unrealistic to me. But I am looking forward to watching the second season to see if they reveal who the mysterious \\"A\\" is!

B004W2UBYW|4.0|While excellently written and research, this was a slow read for me. Maybe it's because the author does too good a job; Steve Jobs is just so unpleasant some times that I didn't always want to spend time in his world. But ultimately worth the read.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|This is a very fun game.  It gets more challenging and keeps you interested.  Classical music is very pleasant too.
0393338398|5.0|The movie made of this book was excellent, and the book is even better. You wouldn't think reading about statistics could be interesting, but that's Michael Lewis' genius as a narrator. Highly recommend.
0375704027|3.0|Norwegian Wood tells the story of Toru Watanabe, a college student living in Tokyo in the late 1960s. The story basically centres on Watanabe's feelings for Naoko, his dead friend's girlfriend, and his long wait while Naoko recovers from a serious mental illness. While he's waiting for her, Watanabe meets Midori, a fellow college student struggling with her issues of childhood neglect and the death of her mother.<br /><br />I finished this book two days ago and I'm still having trouble deciding whether or not I liked it. I certainly enjoyed some elements of it. I enjoyed the writing style, I found it easy to read and the prose was beautiful in places. The characters were generally well developed (with the exception of Kizuki and Noako), but I couldn't say that I liked or enjoyed reading about all of them. In fact it was some of the characters that really brought the book down for me. I thought that Reiko was great, and the sections in the health-retreat made for great reading. Storm Trooper made me laugh; I could easily imagine having a roommate like him! Watanabe had many redeemable qualities and he made a good narrator. However, on the other hand I couldn't stand Midori or Nagasawa. Midori claimed to have issues with both of her parents, but I found her complaints (my parents didn't love me enough to take me to a department store) and her use of the silent treatment to punish Watanabe for failing to notice her new haircut irritating. Nagasawa was simply an unlikable person frequently cheating on his girlfriend with a series of one-night stands.<br /><br />All-in-all the book was ok. The themes of suicide and depression were dark but there were certainly messages of hope and love throughout.<br /><br />I've read several of Murakami's other books and this was probably the one that I liked least (except for South of the Border, West of the Sun), I missed the magical realism of his other works.<br /><br />3.5 Stars

B005PTQPU0|2.0|When seeing a new KB CD was available I jumped at the chance to hear one of my favs from a bygone age. I am sorry to say she has been too long away from the studio. Her musical ideas were silly and previously brilliant soundscapes are now a characature of former albums. Hope she thinks about it more in the future.

B000IJ79UW|5.0|Superman: The Movie is a classic. It has perfect casting in Christopher Reeve as Superman. It was directed with great integrity by Richard Donner. But it also has a great story. What Superman: The Movie manages to do is something that few superhero or comic book films have done since its debut in 1978. Superman: The Movie encapsulated every aspect of the character of Superman and his universe from the 40 years that he had existed at that time. The basic origin of Superman, his heritage and his battle of strength and wit against his arch-foe Lex Luthor are all explored here as well as his relationships with his supporting cast. Superman: The Movie gives the viewer an unadulterated, pure and romantic look at what has become one of America's greatest fictional characters and what is now the most recognizable character next to Mickey Mouse. Superman: The Movie is a masterpiece and should be owned by everyone.<br /><br />There are three other discs in this collection that are very much worth the purchase price. Several behind the scenes documentaries give insight into the production as well as public perception of the character of Superman at the time the film was made. 5 out of 5 stars. Buy this now!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm about 2/3rds of the way through this book...struggling to finish, so far there just is NO story - just sex.  So, if you just want to read about sex, I guess this is the book for you.  But I'll keep reading, hoping it gets better.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.The drive thu scene is pricless! The casting for this movie was on point and the actors gave excellent proformances.I would rent agian.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game is fun. Basically your farm/town building game like on fb. But that is its flaw. I'm not looking for another #*@#ing game that I have to wait for energy to fricken play! If it weren't for that and the fact that (like the fb games) the best stuff costs real money it would hands down be a five star! I mean come on... there has to be a way to make a game like this single player that is &quot;play when you want&quot; so to speak!!! 2 1/2 stars.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After much debate on even buying this book because of the reviews I had read...I am very glad I did. I must admit it is very redundant with the sexual scenes, but if you can get past that and keep moving forward, the story line is there, and very good. Hope the movie will follow the book closely, if so it will be well worth watching!!!!! My opinion, buy the 1st book form your own opinion and go from there, you won't be sorry...
B00002MZ2T|5.0|A beautiful and sometimes haunting selection of vocals. The range and scope of their abilities is amazing. I enjoyed every song on this CD. The CD arrived sooner than I expected and in perfect condition.
B008M34INW|2.0|Gibson. I really like PayBack and read somewhere this was similar or something like that. Well yes and no. Wanted to like it, really did but it was \\"tired\\" and just did not hold my interest. Guess it takes more than just Gibson being Gibson. I do not recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When you start reading this book, it is hard to take breaks. I dont want to put it down once I start reading! this book is a amazing!!! I didn't think I was going to honestly like it, then I was told I should read it they told me a little about it I went ugh ok... And very glad I took there advise, I fell in love with the book, plan on getting the rest of the series!!

B004IJY4L0|5.0|I stumbled across Pendulum after hearing one of their songs in a Halo montage believe it or not!  I listened to Immersion over and over the last few days, and I am completely blown away by the variety, originality and quality on this album.  Immersion ranges from heavy electronic D&B in Salt in the Wounds, The Island 1&2, to Heavy Metal with Self vs. Self, and some VERY melodic tunes, with just some COOL chill beats in Watercolour, Crush, and The Fountain.  I can't get enough of this album, great focus music for me at work, working out or whatever you're up to.  Highly recommended if you're into electronic music!  5*****
0062068423|5.0|I wasn't quite sure about this book in the beginning.  I think I'm getting tired of burned out drunk detectives, but this one surprised me.  Flipping back and forth between the present and the past we learn about a dark spot in Norway's history and what can push a man over the edge.  It was a little confusing at first trying to figure out how things tied together but as you get further along it really takes off.  I really started to like Harry by the end of this book and look forward to the next one. He was flawed but he wasn't broken, and he learns how to play the political game very quickly.  I also like that there were strings left hanging for Harry to pick up in the next novel.  It wasn't all neatly wrapped up in the end but you also weren't left with a cliff hanger, it was just a path untraveled.
B007VYQ6DS|4.0|When watching CHIMPANZEE, it is impossible not to wonder, \\"How did they do that?\\" How on earth could the photographers gotten so close to these chimpanzees to get such an incredibly intimate portrait of their lives. It is beyong amazing and is stunning in every sense of the word. We see the rainforest habitat of the chimps and there are so many gorgeous views of the landscape and the animals and plants that inhabit the forest. Remarkable time lapse photography shows plants growing and blossoming. Incredible. Our story follows infant Oscar being raised by his loving mother Isha. Their scenes together are moving and heartwarming. Human parents could do well to learn about bonding and family love. Isha nurtures and protects Oscar and teaches him the ways of survival.<br />It's not any easy life out in the world, but Oscar and Isha's group is led by wise old Freddie. Unfortunately, resources are limited in the forest and a bigger and stronger band of chimps led by Scar is a constant threat. There is no peace and harmony in the rain forest for all the chimpanzees.<br />DisneyNature makes a fantastic attempt to get up and close to the chimps and to understand their day to day lives. The photography is rich in color and simply breathtaking. This is a perfect movie for the entire family. Maybe it could be upsetting for very little children but the movie is done so well. Nature's occasional violence is kept off screen but there is no doubt of what has just happened. There is an amazing tragedy throughout the film. All hope seems to be lost when a most amazing and surprising thing happened. You have to watch the film to find out. It is truly inspiring.<br />A couple of things have kept me from giving CHIMPANZEE the full 5 stars. Tim Allen narrates the film and I don't think he was the right choice. There are often jokes about Oscar's cute antics. Sure, it makes the film fun but what is the film--a documentary or a scripted story put together with whatever footage was filmed?<br />I had a feeling the filmmakers created a story once they saw what film they had. Maybe the idea was just to appeal to the whole family and to make the movie less serious, but I just don't think comedic actor Tim Allen was right for the role of narrator. Another problem for me was the music. There were a couple of songs that reminded me of 1930's music. I would have expected African traditional music yet the filmmakers went a different route.<br />It has to be pointed out that this film is stunning in its beauty. I can't believe the photographers could have gotten such intimate access to the chimpanzees without disturbing them. Animals lovers can't miss this one.

B008R9N7CO|1.0|Sacha Baron Cohen is an amazingly talented actor and comedian but it seems like he hasn't been able to follow up his quirky BORAT film with something equally creative.<br />Cohen doesn't seem to care who he offends and much of his humor in DICTATOR is over the top in a vulgar and annoying manner. I understand that Cohen is trying to make a point and is making fun of dictators and discontent in the world but to this extreme? He is an equal opportunity insulter. Everyone is fair game. His character General Aladeen is dictator of the fictional Republic of Wadiya. A map of eastern Africa is shown and it looks like Wadiya borders Sudan right about where Eritea is. Aladeen (pronounced like Aladdin in Arabic) seems to be head of an Arabic country (his accent, the \\"language\\" he speaks has some Arabic words and so on) but he says at some point, \\"I am not Arab.\\"  Cohen just seems to be out to offend everyone without at least making it seem its wrong.<br />I like Cohen so I wanted to see the film. I knew to be prepared for awkward moments that were lacking in sensitivity. Lots of references to Osama Bin Laden. It was his double that was killed which is a running joke about Aladeen's doubles.<br />The music brought a few laughs..famous songs like 9 to 5 and EVERYBODY HURTS were played in movie in the Wadiyan language whatever that is! I couldn't tell if the words were made up or if there was an actual language used.<br />Final word is Sacha Baron Cohen is funny and creative. He could have done so much better than THE DICTATOR.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book series!  I have finished all three and can't wait to read again.  I would recommend to others.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl started off as a good read and keep me interested enough not to fall asleep and wanting to read just one more chapter.  I was, however, disappointed with the ending - rather non-climatic for the attention it is receiving.  I was expecting more and was a little disappointed - kind of like some of Stephen King's books in the past 10 years - great start, great characters but not so great endings.  I think it will make a better movie than a book.

0385344333|4.0|For Jack Reacher, the car that finally stopped that Nebraska night meant that Reacher was finally going to be able to move along on his quest to see a woman in Virginia. Wintertime in Nebraska does not mean warm weather. Reacher was glad to get out of the cold. Especially as it had already been a long day and his busted nose was still bothering him pretty good.<br /><br />When he climbed into the backseat of the car next to the woman it didn't take long for him to realize something was off about the group. All three were dressed identically in black pants and blue denim shirts. What they say they are doing and what they are doing are clearly two different things. The men identify themselves as Alan King and Don McQueen. They do the majority of the talking while the woman, Karen Delfuenso, keeps her mouth shut.<br /><br />The guys continue to talk too much and start making minor slipups. Things that might not be obvious to others, but errors the former Army Military Policeman notices. Before long, Reacher figures out that nearly everything they have said is a lie. What he has yet to figure out is what they do, the role of the woman, and why the group keeps hitting police roadblocks set up on the interstate.<br /><br />The latest in the series finds Reacher in the middle of a mess that moves across Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas. Stuck in the center of the country he isn't going further towards his goal of getting to Virginia if things don't get cleared up. Worse yet, as a suspect or a material witness depending on which person from what agency is talking, he might just vanish by way of the Patriot Act if some have their way.<br /><br />Another good one in the series this novel features a more analytical and distant Reacher than the last several books. This is depicted through the use of internal monologue as well as in his dialogue with others. The wide distance between him and others is always there as is his often stated main goal of getting to Virginia.<br /><br />Shifting in point of view from Reacher to many other characters involved in this drama, the focus is building suspense. Since readers know beforehand that Reacher won't die, otherwise the series would end, it becomes obvious that others will die. They do and in two cases it is rather disappointing that things were resolved in that way.<br /><br />Ultimately, A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel is another good one in the series. Relying on his intellect and his physical abilities/skills along with a little help from temporary companions, Reacher achieves a sort of justice. He again manages to survive events only a little worse for wear. After all, he has a woman waiting on him in Virginia.<br /><br />ARC provided by Shelf Awareness in exchange for my objective review.<br /><br />Kevin R.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm not very prone to reading this genre of novels. However I wanted to read it because my son recommended it to me. So I bought a paperback version in spanish. I started reading right away and couldn't stop until the end a couple of days later. I knew then that I wouldn't wait until my regular bookstore had books Two and Three of the series available, so I bought the three books of the series at once from the Kindle Store. They are pretty inexpensive, a very nice and entertaining reading. In all, I'm happy I read them.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Even though Christian was what I would call oversexed and totally obsessed, If more couples read it there would not be as many problems in the bedroom.  Sometimes I counted up to five times a day that he demanded sex!  Are there really people out there like this?  This book definitely turns you on and keeps you turning the page.  Many times I had to MAKE myself put the book down by 2 a.m.!  And, naturally, as soon as I was finished reading the first one, I had to immediately have the next in the series!

I like the ability to choose the amount of pieces and whether or not I want the to be able to rotate.

140120841X|4.0|I made the mistake of watching the film before reading the book. Because the ending was in the back of my mind the whole time I started the book, I felt that maybe the story would lose some of its appeal. While I think that maybe it did, the book itself was able to carry the weight of itself and the film, and still deliver a surprising story that only Moore himself could muster.<br /><br />What initially struck me first was the artwork. I'm not a big fan of watercolor, but the style eventually grew on me, and I realized it fit the dark and \\"splashy\\" tone of the story. The only other style that may have worked was pure black and white (to exaggerate the heavy shadow tones), but as it stands works just fine.<br /><br />Also, reading from beginning to end, I felt that the narrative and dialogue grew much richer and more elaborate over the panels. I admit I was slightly distracted from my ambiance during the initial panels, and I would effortlessly blame this on my attention level, but I read the book all in the same atmosphere; therefore, I can reason that V for Vendetta does indeed become better the more you read it. And in case you've already watched the movie: it's a movie. Obviously it had to condense much to fit the 2-hour limit, and I've never come across an instance where the film was better than the book (if there is, please let me know). The construction of the story here is far more detailed and expansive than initially realized. Only when you get to the end do you become familiar with the scope of V's vision.<br /><br />Which brings me to my conclusion. I would rate this a perfect 5, but the only thing that keeps me at no higher than 4-1/2 is that I felt the story didn't do that great a job and making V the hero as would've believed. The people seem to suddenly mark V as an icon without showing us how. The film, I felt, did a better job at this, showing V give the reigns of London to its people, but I thought the only way this was portrayed in the book was through the explosions (which lasted only a panel or two).<br /><br />Still, it's a great read.hrough the explosions (which lasted only a panel or two).<br /><br />Still, it's a great read.
0792839730|4.0|Outstanding war movie dealing with an Allied defeat (compare with \\"They Were Expendable) featuring fine cast, story and production values. Perhaps overlong but it is a truly sweeping story. My problem with this particular disk is the washed out color reproduction.  Although it seems an MGM product, it has the look of a bootleg. What a pity.

B003O6R2DK|5.0|Full disclosure; I'm a Twin Peaks fan. I'd be extremely interested in the opinion of anyone who hasn't watched the show, but this review is coming from someone who has watched the entire series twice through. I've since come to discover that 'twice' is an extremely low number of views for serious fans.<br /><br />This soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Badalamenti is in top form, and there's not a single track on here which disappoints. I'll go track-by-track, because this album demands nothing less than your full attention.<br /><br />1)  Twin Peaks Theme - From the opening guitar, you're instantly brought to the minds-eye vistas of scenic Twin Peaks- Douglas Firs, mountains, a mill, and... just a slight undertone of darkness.<br />2)  Laura Palmer's Theme - Now, the true depths of the album are introduced. The minimal piano in the background only underscores the feelings of apprehension, suspicion, and paranoia... with just a hint of lightness popping up around 1:04... only to be brought back into the shadows at 1:56.<br />3)  Audrey's Dance - Evocative of an old Private I movie... or a derelict Old-South speak easy... or a small-town strip club reeking of Parliaments and cheap whiskey.  This track paints a definite picture- your experiences in life will determine the color palette.<br />4)  The Nightingale - Julee Cruise lends her voice to several tracks on this and other Twin Peaks works, and she is nothing short of amazing. Reminiscent of Tracey Thorn, Beth Orton, and many other haunting songstresses, hers is a voice that any true trip-hop fan will instantly melt over. Myself included. This track will make you want to close your eyes, sit next to a window, and feel the cold winter air on the other side.<br />5)  Freshly Squeezed - Similar in feel to 'Audrey's Dance', this one would fit perfectly in a smoky old jazz club. Basil Heyden Manhattan, if you please.<br />6)  The Bookhouse Boys - God, that intro sax just cuts right through you. The brushed drums, the haphazard hi-hats, it all comes together in a haze of pure mystery.<br />7)  Into The Night - This track will have you on your knees. Cruise devastates- this is easily my favorite song of hers. The song would feel equally at home on the next Massive Attack album- the yearning, the loss, the anxiety, the redemption.<br />8)  Night Life in Twin Peaks - Do yourself a favor and TURN ON THE LIGHTS before playing this song. If you listen to this song in the dark, you'll become convinced that a serial killer is in the room with you. And I'm not saying that there isn't one there, but this song will definitely scratch your nerves.<br />9)  Dance of the Dream Man - Whereas Audrey's Dance made you want to indulge your inner pole-dancer, this one will have you feeling Rat-Pack-ready. Jazzy and urban, haunting and upbeat, this one will have you ironing out a nice shirt and trying to figure out how to exactly to 'put on the Ritz'.<br />10)  Love Theme from Twin Peaks - Opens with even more throbbing anxiety than Laura Palmer's Theme, the highs get a little higher and the lows get a little lower. A deep one.<br />11)  Falling - Oh, Julee Cruise. Julee, Julee Cruise. This soundtrack could serve as the perfect gateway drug to your wondrousness, and if people discovered you only through this album, then that wouldn't be a terrible thing. This is the perfect song to wrap up the album. 'Nuff said.<br /><br />This album is extremely cohesive. The instrumentals are perfectly balanced by Cruise, and both categories of song are represented perfectly. A great album for late-night listening, road trips, nostalgia, and dark wistful days.phazard hi-hats, it all comes together in a haze of pure mystery.<br />7)  Into The Night - This track will have you on your knees. Cruise devastates- this is easily my favorite song of hers. The song would feel equally at home on the next Massive Attack album- the yearning, the loss, the anxiety, the redemption.<br />8)  Night Life in Twin Peaks - Do yourself a favor and TURN ON THE LIGHTS before playing this song. If you listen to this song in the dark, you'll become convinced that a serial killer is in the room with you. And I'm not saying that there isn't one there, but this song will definitely scratch your nerves.<br />9)  Dance of the Dream Man - Whereas Audrey's Dance made you want to indulge your inner pole-dancer, this one will have you feeling Rat-Pack-ready. Jazzy and urban, haunting and upbeat, this one will have you ironing out a nice shirt and trying to figure out how to exactly to 'put on the Ritz'.<br />10)  Love Theme from Twin Peaks - Opens with even more throbbing anxiety than Laura Palmer's Theme, the highs get a little higher and the lows get a little lower. A deep one.<br />11)  Falling - Oh, Julee Cruise. Julee, Julee Cruise.

0525953728|5.0|I read a significant amount of books of this genre: Tom Clancy, Vince Flynn, Ben Coes, Brad Thor, Lee Childs, etc.  \\"No Easy Day\\" is written well enough to complete in this arena. However, what made it a 5-Star for me was the fact that it wasn't the result of someone's imagination. I'm a Vietnam Vet so, perhaps the military connection has special meaning for me.  But regardless your life's path, as an American and victim of the events wrought by Osama Bib Laden and his crew of the criminally insane, to be taken on a literary journey to his compound to witness his final moments and his death at the hands of true American heroes was as thrilling a read as I have ever enjoyed.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|This was purchased as an inexpensive replacement for a larger Behringer mixer that, after several years use, blew its internal power supply. I really didn't want to open up the old one and diagnose the problem, so a little better that 60 bucks, and I had a new mixer. I use it primarily to record commercial copy on my computer at home and then email the mp3 files to my radio station. Occasionally, my wife also needs to record some piano music for her church choir, so, two mic inputs are enough. The headphone output actually powers small computer speakers quite adaquately.

B0013D8LOU|3.0|What a cast.  Johnny Depp along with some of the finest actors from the Harry Potter films:  Helena Bonham Carter, who is as wickedly amoral in Sweeney Todd as she was portraying Bellatrix LeStrange; Alan Rickman delivering his lines with that incredible timing I first became truly aware of in the Potter films, but showing a different dimension to his talents I truly enjoyed.  I have gained more and more respect for Rickman's talents as I have begun to explore his filmography.  Timothy Spall ... I apologize for seeing him as a \\"toss-off\\" in the Potter films; again, as I explore, I see what a talent this man has for the roles that no one but Timothy Spall could pull off so convincingly.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd is over the top.  The music is incredible, the story line is engrossing, and Stephen Sondheim is at the top of his form in this English Opera.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the compete bloodbath, squirting of blood everywhere, gallons of blood, was way beyond anything required for me to get the idea.  The director indulged in an orgy of bloodletting where a river would have been more than enough.  The bloodletting goes beyond anything needed to make the point and into some bizarre sexual release.<br /><br />I hope to see a better interpretation of this opera some day.  I would love to see the very same stars; Rickman, Carter, Spall and Depp, with a better director.  Throwing blood all over the place only entertains me so far, and then it is as if that is all you know how to do.  Go direct \\"Carrie.\\"
B008XG1X18|4.0|Maybe I'm not quite there with knowing how to run it, but I wish you could edit. hoards with it. That's my only complaint, but it's a big one for me. Find a way to fix that and I'll change it to five stars.

0345803485|1.0|I had many \\"friends\\" recommend this book. Do they know me at all?This book has strong parallels to Twilight. I would pick twilight over this book any day though! The writing style is awful and that's not even taking into account the plot. Everyone in \\"Ana's\\" eyes is either more attractive than her or they aren't worth noticing. And she hangs onto her virginity to lose it to this guy she barely knows after two weeks?! to sum  it up in one word, AWFUL.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Is fun to play and and also very addictive, but it is not a mindless game. You do exercise those gray cells. Its easy to learn and play, and the difficulty increases progressively. The graphics are simple and works well. I love playing it!

What happened?<br /><br />I remember my friend drove up in his car and had just bought this the day of its release.<br /><br />I was in dismay.  I was like this is like ACDC.  Oh no!<br /><br />It was like the moment when Motley Crue followed up Shout at the Devil with Theater of Pain only they didnt start dressing like girls.<br /><br />That very moment was the end of Metallica for me.  They bought into their own hype and did what their label or producer told them to.

B005Z271Y6|1.0|I love the songs, but profanity is something that I can do without.  I have never owned a DVD/Blu-ray that had so many f-words.  Do not watch this Blu-ray with your kids.
034580404X|5.0|The book shares experiences that most of us have never even heard of.  Throughout the trilogy is a warm, engaging and dangerous love.  Twist and turns that keep you wanting more.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Way too much in common with twilight. Not well written at all. It is like they took the twilight characters and tried to make the story human, adult and sexy and it was an epic fail. I read all three just to see if it got any better and had nothing else to read and i wish i hadn't wasted the time.
B007HO392S|3.0|First let me just say that I love Carrie Underwood. I am a huge fan and always will be. She has an amazing voice and a great personality. I absolutely loved her previous albums so I felt certain that I would love Blown Away without listening to the songs first. I loved to purchase CDs without listening to the songs. It reminds me of the old days. :)<br /><br />But once I listened to the whole album once, I was not pleased. There seemed to be no consistency between the tracks. I remembered that one of the reviewers said the more you listen to the album the better it gets. So far, I've listened to this about 5 times through and each time I'm always wishing for something better. I keep skipping tracks to get to the 2 or 3 songs I do like. I purchased Blown Away with Chris Young's Neon album and Chris Young's is far better.<br /><br />Conclusion: Carrie Underwood was a lot more experimental with Blown Away. I can barely call it country music. I miss her songs like \\"Jesus Take the Wheel,\\" \\"Wasted,\\" \\"All-American Girl,\\" etc..

B007RTAR64|3.0|Most Barbie dolls that are supposed to look like celebrities instead of generic Barbies still end up looking like \\"Barbie.\\"  This one actually looks like the Katniss character.  The clothing and accessories are wonderfully detailed, though I worry about the durability.  It's definitely not designed to be played with, definitely a collectible doll.  That said, that is exactly what my daughter wanted it for and she's thrilled with it!
B000M341QE|4.0|One of the best mobb/cop flicks with 3 heavy hitters leading the way.  The disc was new as advertised.  And I received it timely.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|We were introduced to Christian Grey in the first book. Here is an incredibly handsome, rich, talented, dashing, bright, charming, take charge, successful, sexy, impressively potent, substantially well hung guy who, as it turns out, has a considerably dark, fragile, kinky side. The dark aspect of his character is a result of childhood traumas: underneath the smooth exterior he is a hurt little boy who needs tender loving care from a good woman to cope.  What's not for a girl to like!? The routinely orgasmic 21 year old  heroine , blessed or cursed with hair trigger arousability, is not only a lover, but also an earth mother wise beyond her years. Will she be able to help him? Will she contimue to love him? Can they possibly live happily ever after? Will he grow tired of her independent nature? Will he hurt her? Will someone else hurt him or her? It's all fun for a while, with occasional interesting characters and plot twists, but the second book drags a little in comparison with the first, and the situations start to feel a bit repetitive. Despite that, if you enjoyed the first book, you will probably enjoy this one as well.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was the most entertaining of the three grey books.  Brings the story full circle and definitely didn't leave me hanging, just wanting more.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book has me wanting book #2 and I'm only halfway through it. Ryan, has written a long book! I like long books. The characters are mean, greedy, rich, poor, hungry and a few have hidden talents. You will feel like part of the group. I think we all have a bit of the \\"blood song\\" in us.

B006CDCWDM|5.0|In these weeks of being denied watching Rafa's great talent on the tennis courts, the next best thing has been to read his personal accounts of his Wimbledon and US Open wins in the book \\"Rafa\\". They are gripping, on the edge of your seat and pure Rafael Nadal. In addition the reader is treated to a lovely story of his life, family and team. The only downer was some repetitious information, but the overall book is a wonderful read!

0312243022|1.0|I read this book on a transatlantic plane trip when it was newly published in paperback.  I had paid over $10 for the book and since it caught my eye in the airport terminal, and it was fairly lengthy, I thought it would last me the entire trip.  What a waste of money! What a waste of eyesight! I had nothing else to read with me and it was a long trip so I soldiered on in reading it, off and on, when I would pick it up again after putting it down in annoyance. I did not read all of it -- as other reviewers have said, the purple prose was too purple and I skipped large sections, all the while becoming more and more annoyed that the book's plot had no point to it.  I was so annoyed and bored by the stupid, pretentious writer's MFA school floating point of view and the non-plot that I left it in the seat pocket to offend someone else.  I do not think I read all of it.  Since I do recall the \\"twist\\"  at the end, I think I must have skipped ahead to see what plot device the author chose to use.  I avoided the movie version because of my negative experience with the book.  Read a few pages in the bookstore and if you think you can stand an entire book of this stuff, go ahead and buy it, but be prepared to be bored.  I think there was supposed to be some kind of existential core to the book, but it was so convoluted and boring that such a core was not something I felt inclined to think about.  This book marked a definite development in my maturity as a reader.  This was the first book I had ever begun that was so annoying that I did not force myself to finish straight through to the end.
B002WMIFY2|4.0|Simple and easy to buy, and it worked like a charm. Amazon makes it easy to watch a video here and now. I enjoyed it and would buy again.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This isn't a bad film but I don't understand the extreme hype around it - it's The Running Man and Battle Royale mixed together with a bit of TV quality teenage romance thrown in. I enjoyed the movie (and it's been a bad, bad year for film) but it's not a great story by any means.<br /><br />Credibility is the major problem in the film. Given the extreme set up of having teenagers fight each other to the death, the movie did little to justify why this ever happened. Supposedly, the candidates are fighting for food in their districts but this is far from clear - everyone looks pretty well fed for the most part. There's not enough back story to allow the audience to understand the desperation that presumably drives this futuristic society. Similarly, our hero, Katniss, volunteers as a substitute for her sister without ever establishing her sudden need to face almost certain death - why did she do it?<br /><br />While the acting is solid, there's nothing compelling about any of the characters. The love story reads like bad teenage fiction where a life-or-death friendship literally blossoms out of nowhere. Considering the gravity of the situation they are in, the romance is like a tacked-on subplot that starts to take over the film. Predictably, the games of the reality show change to allow the star-crossed lovers to win together (if they can survive, which is pretty much a given).<br /><br />As the games start, teenagers wonder into the woods and one after another meet their grisly endings. There isn't anything particularly clever about the way this happens and some of the sequences are pretty weak. Here's one example - Katniss escapes a murderous group by climbing a tree and one of her pursuers fires an arrow, once, to get her. Rather than shooting off more arrows, they bizarrely decide to sleep at the bottom of the tree. She drops a nest of LSD bees to kill everyone - she then gets stung and passes out for days perfectly safely despite being 100 feet from everyone who wants to kill her. And this is how most of the sequences evolve in a \\"and then\\" type of plotting that doesn't make much sense or create any tension.<br /><br />Whereas Battle Royale shows the sudden transition of the players having to literally fight for their lives, Katniss sort of bumps along the ride with plenty of help from sympathetic players and flying jars of ointment. You never really feel she's in much danger so it's hard to get involved with the film. And the violence is toned down so much that it's easy to forget that almost everyone on the screen is going to die - they should have skipped the PG-13 rating, though maybe that's 95% of the intended audience.<br /><br />From a production standpoint, with the exception of the great design of the futuristic metropolis, the set looks like it was stolen from practically any show on the SyFy channel. It's hard to see where the $78 million went. Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks' wardrobe pushes the envelope a little too far and borders on the ridiculous, trumping even the The Fifth Element for distracting the audience and adding nothing to the story. I was waiting for Derek Zoolander to make a cameo.<br /><br />So overall I was disappointed. I was sucked into the sheer hype around this film's release and found that it delivers a reasonable way to waste a couple of hours but hardly anything to justify two more sequels.o wants to kill her.

B007V2UGPE|1.0|I purchased this game on a whim.  The character designs are fairly well conceived and the game play though simplistic (forward and retreat) is addictive.  However, as other reviewers have commented, this game design has aspects left to be desired.  For instance, after getting to level 20, the icon selection for power-ups began to become dysfunctional.  Furthermore, after working to get to level 21, the game, for some reason unknown to me, reset itself causing me to lose all of my hard earned characters, experience and upgrades!  Until this game is fixed by the game designers, I would play with caution.  However, if you consider level 21 to be the end of the game, then this game is great!
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|Since Amazon clumps all the various formats (VHS, DVD, 3D/Blu-ray) into this one review section, I don't want to berate the movie because the Lion King is a 5 star movie.<br /><br />Actually, I would give the 3D/Blu-ray version only 3 stars because the 3D rendition is sub-par. If you own a 3D TV capable of converting 2D to 3D, you will get as good result from the original DVD version as this (3D) movie accomplishes. Granted, the original production of this movie did not anticipate a 3D version making it subject to limitations of 2D to 3D scene layering. I was just not really impressed with the 3D version. I'm just as happy(er) with the original DVD version.<br /><br />Anyway, The Lion King is a really good movie worth owning in any format. I recommend the original DVD movie version or the basic blu-ray version.
B0001CNRS4|5.0|This movie played and looked excellent :) I would recommend it to anyone. It was in great condition and played with no problem
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am rarely captivated by a book.  This one was excellent.  I could not wait to finish reading it.  Highly recommend it.
B001RUXW48|5.0|This movie is one of the best of its kind! A must see. Dicaprio at his very best. You will not want to take your eyes off the screen.
B002YOJBYG|5.0|I really enjoyed this version of Il Trovatore. Although the production is old (1978)and the video format is too narrow the recording is quite good. The singers and direction are first quality although the acting of Capuccilli is too stiff.<br />I recommend it.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|well this game is fun but gets very boring in the same scenery. and even after I finished all the missions finally you are still in the same environment and start all over with missions. boring

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Thirty years ago I read everything Stephen King wrote. In the ensuing years I lost interest in his writing and stopped reading his books. I am not sure why I bought 11/22/63, but I am sure glad I did. I found the book riveting. I won't describe any of the plot as it is just too fun to experience first hand. Suffice it to say that it has my unqualified recommendation.
B001Q4Z5Z4|5.0|A great mindless action movie with very little plot, a few unexpected twists and a feel good ending.  If you like bang bang shoot em ups, this will not disappoint.

0439023491|3.0|Everything that was likable about Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games is tossed aside until the final 25% or so of in this second book of the trilogy.<br /><br />Then it's back to the arena.<br /><br />Sure in the first book we got the Katniss who was torn between two cute boys and the Katniss that was tomboying it up and not wanting to be at the formal party or wear fancy dresses but this book was all that.<br /><br />Then it's back to the arena.<br /><br />Peeta is a fine boy who can talk a good game but Gale is a man that is complimentary to Katniss. We get lots of moon eyed Peeta throughout this version while Gale is shoved to the side.<br /><br />Then it's back to the arena.<br /><br />The Hunger Games was about sacrifice. It's a powerful part of story telling. Casablanca wouldn't have been a tenth of the film it is if Rick had gotten on that plane with Elsa at the end. It was the sacrifice that made it powerful. In the first novel the ultimate sacrifice was a bit short-circuited but I thought in a fair way. This time, not so much.<br /><br />And as far a going back to the arena. Yeah, get out of it. Die Hard II wasn't about another building, was it?
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Amazing how the author can maintain several different story lines simultaneously. Totally hooked. Made the mistake of taking my kindle to work, didn't get a damn thing accomplished all week! And I still have 4 more to finish!

1439199388|3.0|The author is not the first to write about this subject, the book is far too long, and it adds nothing new. The 'good news' is that it illuminates an important topic.<br /><br />The clear message is that good hygiene is not always good, and has become a factor in rising rates of asthma, arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, M.S., and diabetes. Thus, allergic and autoimmune conditions are more frequent in rich than poor nations, even those with genetically identical populations. National incidence rates vary by factor as high as 20.<br /><br />The findings clearly suggest the potential for treating some illnesses with 'good' bacteria.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|A good story with some unseen twists.  Blake Crouch has become one of my favorite newly discovered authors.  I highly recommend 'Pines' and 'Run' from him.

I read this book in Afghanistan and it had me on the edge of my bunk for hours. I couldn't put it down! I recommend it to any avid fantasy reader.
1609611543|1.0|I bought this book not for the \\"diet\\" aspect, but for the history of wheat and the research that Dr. Davis supposedly did.  What I found were many flaws in citations/studies.  So I coughed up the $3.99 to send this back to Amazon to get some kind of refund.<br /><br />Dr. Davis should not have marketed this as a weight loss book.  Eliminating wheat is only one component in leading a healthier food lifestyle.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this one. I suggest reading Mark Sisson's Primal Blueprint before this.
0345803485|3.0|I read all three of these books in 5 days - quick and easy to read with an interesting subject matter that intrigued me. Book #2 was my favorite.I found myself wanting to know more about WHY Christian was the way he was... which is why I kept reading (mostly!). I was however, disappointed with the simplicity of the writing. The characters were underdeveloped and the author displayed a limited vocabulary and her descriptions because repetitive- I was getting bored about half way through the 2nd book. I could tell this author used the \\"Twilight Template\\". Overall, not a bad series... just not great.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild is a terrific story that inspires women of all ages to go beyond their prescribed limitations!  The author demonstrates how nature can challenge us to find our own answers to life's experiences of loss and sadness.  How wonderful to know that their are young women who have the ability and courage to express their feelings and experiences way beyond the shallow role models that are presented to us on TV.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Memorable. Engaging. Brutal. I read through these books quickly. I enjoyed the writing style and the depth of the characters. I felt bad for Peeta but I was on team Gale for sure!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Just curious if the DVD has the adoption joke (Loki killing the 80 people because he was adopted)in the DVD version or if they took that out?<br /><br />As much as I absolutely loved the movie, I can not buy the DVD if Disney choose to leave this line in the movie.
0061969664|3.0|I am a big fan of Cornwell but this latest book worries me. Uhtred is becoming...gasp...boring. There is nothing in this book that readers of the Saxon Chronicles haven't been over before. The battles are all short and frankly boring. The best fight was toward the beginning of the book when Uhtred was defending a bridge. I found the insights into Uhtred's strategy insightful and these were entertaining, especially when he set a trap for the Danish army. However, the climatic battle was a total letdown. It seems all the villians in the book were hastily drawn so they could be dropped together for Uhtred to kill in one place then be rescued from death though you knew he wasn't going to die. After six Saxon Chronicles and the three books of the Arthurian trilogy we get it already about christianity. The endless jabs and run downs about the church are becoming overkill and are no longer interesting. It is boring that every priest and bishop that shouts at Uhtred and calls him a heretic is incompetant and bad for Wessex while the ones that drink and like women or are doddering old men like Uhtred. There are no compelling christian clergy in the series at this point, all of them are little more than directly from one dimensional central casting.<br /><br />It feel a bit sad when Uhtred recalls his deeds like when he killed Ubba by the sea or I remember him defending the causeway against Danes in the marsh because those were thrilling tales. Now I find myself not really caring what Uhtred is doing against this nameless Jarl or that boring warlord. Can we press fast forward to get to the battle for Bebbenburg already? This book spans about 3 or 4 years of time and half of it is spent waiting for Alfred to die. It seems to me the book would have been better served if it had started out with Alfred dying and the events of this book taking up the first half then moving forward with the plot. Uhtred apparantly receives vast estates and wealth here but does nothing to advance his cause for Bebbenburg. In fact when he is poor at the start of this book he has 53 men, but when he becomes what seems to be the second most powerful lord in Mercia he has only 143? Toward the end of the book we are given Uhtred's age as 45. That surely has to be well into old age for the dark ages (Alfred died at 50), you would think Uhtred would feel some urgency for retaking Bebbenburg.<br /><br />Cornwell states in the historical notes that is it a shame the history of England seems like it begins in 1066 and I find it admirable that he is writing this history of Saxon of England but perhaps it is time to wrap up this series. Edward, the new king rules for another 22 years. Are we really going to be fighting petty Danish warlords with a 55 year old Uhtred for the next 3 books? I will continue reading Cornwell because he writes the best historical fiction out there but this series needs an infusion of new blood.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My wife and I have watched this movie twice now, and each of us has found it to be one of the best movies we have ever seen!  I, for one, am so tired of seeing men portrayed in the media as selfish, philandering, abusive, heartless womanizing brutes.  This movie shows that there are indeed virtues in manhood and those men who have really grown up understand what it is to be a man reach for and strive to meet those expectations imposed on them by their better nature.  The movie is very well acted, heartfelt, and best of all for me, very inspirational.  And, though I am a man of faith, I appreciate that the religious aspect of this film was not overdone and/or preachy in any way.
1612183956|2.0|(SPOILER ALERT!) This novel began with promise. It hooked my attention and I was at once intrigued as to what had happened to Ethan. However, the novel soon became a victim of a repetitive storyline: chase after chase after chase; Ethan's numerous escapes; his re-capture; bouts of unconsciousness; acts of physical aggression on his personage that should have incapacitated him for weeks and not hours as inferred; and reminiscences of an (unnecessarily gory) account of his torture in Iraq - all contributed to make the guts of this novel uninspiring to read. I very nearly ceased reading the novel altogether. In fact, I put it aside for several days and read something more engrossing. However, I came back to it - if only to discover the ending. I wish I hadn't, for the ending turned out to be more chases but in a different setting. The jump to another millennia didn't come as a huge surprise to me. I was almost expecting it. However, Pilcher's rationale for setting up Wayward Pines was flawed: a peaceful community where they could go about their lives normally? Then why the pack mentality and Beverley's gruesome death? I was left dissatisfied with the ending.<br />As far as Blake Crouch's writing style is concerned. I am not American and I found the persistent non-use of pronouns at the start of sentences irritating. Grammatically, it did not read well. It may have been an attempt at making the narrative fast paced, however, there are more effective ways to do this. Also, he assumes that non-American readers know the meaning of all the abbreviations used in the story. Some I found in my Kindle's dictionary, others...well, I am still none the wiser. If he hopes to sell his novels to a wider audience, he should bear this in mind.
1423124111|5.0|Poster Art of the Disney Parks is obviously a labor of love on the part of the authors. Not only do we get to see lots of great Disney posters created over the years for the Disney theme parks world-wide, but the thoughtfully written commentary puts the poster art into perspective with the Disney Parks' history. The authors also explain how the posters help shape the visitors' total theme park experience. Tony Baxter's introduction is also excellent, particularly when he writes about how the art of a great poster differs from an illustration. I also appreciated the comments from some of the current designers about the creative decisions that went into creating their posters as well as some of the original concept art.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|Item received as advertised and on time. This should be a must for all ancient Roman movie collectors. Great story.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|An American icon like the Wright Brothers. a fantastic read for the young and old. Steve Jobs was an ordinary man with an extraordinary vision.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I saw this movie in the theatre. When I watched the DVD I purchased through amazon a critical scene was cut from the DVD version<br />. It was disappointing.
B005K17RU0|3.0|The app lacks the design and information of the original website. But more baffling is even windows phone app of accuweather is better then this.
B00122V6OE|5.0|This album has always struck me as a significant climb in musical maturity for the Canadian trio, and now with the re-issue, it comes across in even higher clarity, each intricate note captured perfectly here (at least in my humble opinion--snob audiophiles, take a hike!). Why can't the current digital recordings sound this great? Newer, more recent Rush albums, while artistically incredible, don't sound half as good as this in terms of sound engineering.<br /><br />As for the songlist, there's not a bad one to be heard on this album. Each is a spectacular display of supreme musicianship, no thrown-together filler material here. For those older music fans who have never really experienced Rush and want to give them a shot, this is the album I'd recommend you start with.<br /><br />Just crank it up on a good sound system, sit back with a nice glass of wine, and let it carry you away--The more you listen, the more you'll be amazed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Excellent read, enjoyable and it is very relatable to real life events that we all have to deal with and work through.

0525953728|5.0|A well written account from a SEAL who was there. Many thanks for clarifying the facts as many of us wondered what really happened from hearing all the BS from the news. Awesome job from a fellow Navy vet!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Works great on my Droid Bionic. Fun way to pass the time. Most levels not to hard to pass you just have to take your time and think it through.
B001AUKUSG|5.0|Album from 1965 by the great otis redding includes the classic hit RESPECT (later done by aretha franklin) and a copy of the rolling stone song SATISFACTION.Also a couple of songs written by Sam Cooke change gonna come and shake, this is a must have in any music lovers collection.Otis Redding has soul and we are all lucky to have the pleasure to hear it on this classic album.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use and fun! I am so glad Pinterest has an Android app now! I have yet to find a downside.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|I cannot stop listening to Kid Rock's \\"Born Free\\" CD over and over and over again! The musical journey he takes me on each time I listen moves me and grows me as his outstanding musical artistry crosses and mixes genres which really can't be described; one must hear and feel this CD to truly appreciate Kid Rock's heart and soul. You can give it a listen at his website before you decide to buy. I saved up to do so, and it's worth every penny, over and over and over again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Was having a rough evening, so I turned on the kindle. Low and behold there was a reminder to spend five minutes in the Bible every day.  I love this app.  I'm on a mission from God.
B008602KQI|5.0|I hope that the other two movies will follow the books as well as the first one did...<br />The first movie was Great!!
B001L62REY|5.0|top of the line video, a must see i have been very happy with the whole amazon experience.am always looking for new products movies etc. amazon suggests to me
B008602KQI|4.0|Watched the movie three times but I didn't read the book so I can't draw any comparisons there.  The plot is a bit disturbing but not overly graphic. Probably not a movie for those who can't deal with a somewhat depressing theme.  When the movie's over, it makes you glad you don't live in that world.  Very good movie!
B004RJMUJO|2.0|I love the this game but for some reason it said I don't own the game anymore so I have to buy it again but I'm not spending anymore money or time if they are gonna do this to me
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very easy game play. Some instructions could be a little clearer.  For example, better explanation of how the garage works would be nice.
B004XZR63M|4.0|This book provides a service many other books do not when it comes to personal finances; and that is to give you a very simple concept of how to understand where your money goes and what it does for you. The author many times uses the phrase \\"make your money work for you,\\" and while this book does not give you exact strategies for making this happen (he provides examples of how he personally uses his funds, mainly in real estate; don't confuse this with a strategy, as he warns numerous times), he gives a simple set of rules to help you analyze and think about what your money is doing and how to utilize it best.<br /><br />I recommend this to a person looking who wants to probe learning about their personal finances. I would not recommend this book to someone looking for the nuts and bolts parts of investing, such as types of investing or strategies, you will leave this book with nothing you came looking for.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Wonderful instrumentation as well as lyrics that stimulate the mind about world subjects such as Love and belief in things.Perfect album for dining or wanting to kick some tunes at home.To be honest I didn't know anything about Robert but now this album has made me a fan.
