3836538725|2.0|Make no mistake - the book quality is good, and the images are nothing short of amazing. Sebastiao Salgado is one of the finest living photographers, and his work is enough to prompt other photographers to feel both inspired and deeply envious. However, this book has one fatal flaw:<br /><br />Every single large image is presented as a 2 page spread, with a page division running right down the middle! This is nothing short of sacrilegious! When one purchases a book featuring the work of a great artist, one does NOT want distractions from, or defacement of, that work. This could easily have been avoided by producing the book in horizontal (landscape) format instead of the vertical (portrait) format the publisher chose... and for me, it utterly ruins my enjoyment of Salgado's incomparable work.

B0083Z6AH6|5.0|It's funny that &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; is Jane Austen's most well-known book when &#34;Persuasion&#34; is clearly superior in plot and character development. Don't get me wrong--&#34;P&P&#34; is a phenomenal novel, but &#34;Persuasion&#34; (with its Cinderella motifs) will pull at your heartstrings much more than her classic &#34;P&P.&#34;

B00ENXBUR2|1.0|Movie itself is great.  The one star is for packaging.  The stand that came with the movie was broken.  The front little tab came was loose in the tin case.  In addition, I do not really see how the tiny stand would hold the case anyway.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Overall, I greatly enjoyed this novel.  I gave it a 4 rating because of the somewhat slow beginning/set up of characters; thereafter it was a &#34;can't put down&#34; read.  Early in the novel I thought it was a &#34;chick read&#34;, but that definitely changed as the story progressed.<br />I would definitely recommend and I will definitely look into other books written by this author.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|As a true consumer reviewer I always like to start my reviews with this caveat, I review based on what the manufacturer says the product can do.  I then compare that to what users feel the product should do and provide a Pro's which explains areas that the product goes above and beyond with their functionalities and Con's where I (my personal feeling) recommend areas I believe the product should improve in.  Star's are taken away from the product when it fails to deliver what the manufacturer said the product could do.<br /><br />The Chromecast viewer is a great viewer display technology.  It definitely makes TV watching easy, economical and practical.  Big different that consumers should be aware of, this is not a Roku or an Apple TV competitor.  Their are no channels with this system.  The system is probably the most advanced viewer in the industry right now.  The system literally works as a displayer where you can display videos and items from your mobile device assuming that the application is Chromecast compatible.  This part really takes away from the product since not all apps (and for good reason) are Chromecast compatible.  That being said you can also view all computer related items on Windows or Mac.  As the product specifies it requires chrome to do so.  So the compatibility is really around any system that can load chrome.  You can not use window media player per say to view movies or any third party application.  IT MUST have a chrome plugin that uses chrome to view.  For my purpose, HBOGO, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and online viewing it works amazing.  Same applies for the phone, i only have apps that are compatible with Chromecast so no issues there.  But i am sure in this community of users that have different needs that maybe an impact somewhere down the line, but for 35 bucks amazing product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-  Easy to setup.  Not difficult at all but it does require a degree of understanding of your TV an knowing your wifipassword.<br />-  Delay is pretty amazing, from computer to Chromecast only about a 1 second delay.  Beats the pants off of Netgear's products and Windows 8 screen display technology<br />-  Audio quality is great, its an HDMI adapter so make sure you have HDMI on your TV<br />-  The software needed to run is simple to use.  One click of a button and its up and running.<br />-  Small and non intrusive.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  Google needs to add better user instructions on setup.  I know they have a guide but it would be nice on screen<br />-  A win 32 agent or a .dmg app would be nice.  I understand its more to maintain but for this type of technology it would be nice to be able to see local machine videos and movies.  Case and point workout dVD's would be great to prodcast through Chromecast

I have no way to contact Amazon by phone to rectify this....Any suggestions????

1594204217|3.0|There's a war happening in America.  Beachheads have been established in Berkeley.  Park Slope streets run red with mistrust, neighbors eying one another and asking themselves `Are you one of THEM?'  Partisans choose their banners:  Gluten-Free for All Mankind, Viva the Vegans!, or We-Only-Eat-Kale-Grown-by-an-Authentic-Native-American-Named-Chief-Bloodhorse.  COOKED is another manifesto (holy book?) in our twenty-first century food wars.<br /><br />Michael Pollan is a supremely talented food writer.  Very few people in America can write a thirty page bread making scene with the kind of tension that Pollan brings to it.  That isn't sarcasm.  It's actually engaging.  You want to see if he can successfully make bread at home.  That's the best part of this book - Pollan makes the reader excited about cooking, and cooking as purely as one can with natural, unadulterated ingredients.  After a long session with COOKED, you'll find yourself moseying over to Williams-Sonoma and imagining a more ambitious culinary life.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is a 450 page book that could have been reduced to five mid-size articles in The New Yorker.  The structure is broken down into sections corresponding to the Classical elements - Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.  Such a simple plan proves inadequate for the meandering, convoluted theses jammed into the pages.  Expect long, ponderous forays into the chemistry of cheese, the chemistry of fermentation, the chemistry of bread.<br /><br />He does a serviceable job of elucidating his gustatory Weltanschauung: processed/store-bought food=bad and local/organic/home-cooked/pseudo-paleo consumption=good.  It's impossible not to see his point and agree with it (at least partially).<br /><br />But here's the problem:  when you talk about how and what people should eat, you're talking about class and money.  Tell a family of six in Arkansas, helmed by overworked parents, that they need to drop the KFC and prepare some bouillabaisse, and you'll probably be the one who ends up in the cauldron.  Cooking requires time, money, and serenity - all things that flow abundantly in our coastal enclaves, but are scarce in the rest of the world.  We are a fat nation because we eat a lot of food - that it's processed and store-bought is not the main problem.  Pollan sees his at-home cooking solution as a national panacea, yet he only obliquely touches on the fundamental issues fueling our ever-expanding middle.<br /><br />This book will speak to the Whole Foodies and the Organic Diehards.  It's a beautiful vision, one that certainly influenced me personally, but it rings of the idealistic hobbyist not the true peacemaker who seeks a realistic end to a deadly, mounting scourge.robably be the one who ends up in the cauldron.

B002M9WW30|5.0|Great movies, my dad had them all on VHS so it's very nice to see them all in high definition cinematic quality. Picture quality is great, menus aren't ridiculous its simple. Great buy
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Because the ones I ordered for the DVD's are movies I saw on TV and I wanted to have DVD's of them without the commercials and also to keep so that I can see them over and over again.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Compelling story. I could not put this down. From start to finish, this book's character development is rich and deep. I feel like Victoria is someone who actually has her own shop and I can easily see Elizabeth's vineyard. I loved this story.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Fun and challenging game that is well worth the price.  I spent far too many hours playing this game.  Buy and enjoy.
B00E8S2JZ4|3.0|Going into The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I knew that it was a tale originally written for children, but the Lord of The Rings trilogy was so well done, that I fully expected the first Hobbit movie to be just as masterful. It was a pretty good film, however it didn't have the luster that Lord of The Rings had. The trilogy was magical, it's the reason people go to the movies, but the Hobbit, seemed to be playing off the fame of the Lord of The Rings and at times was directionless. For those who don't know the story, it starts to tell the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his original journey with Gandalf. In the Lord of The Rings, they go on this impossible journey in order to save Middle Earth, but here, the journey is about saving the dwarfs gold from a dragon. It really doesn't have the intensity or the urgency require to make a film like this work. Nothing had changed for over two hundred years, but all of a sudden, now is the time to stop the dragon, why? The film was not bad, but it doesn't come off as this great adventure and that could have something to do with the childish elements. This is a PG-13 film with fighting and beheadings, yet it's also a film with singing dwarfs, drunk gnomes, and a wizard with Alzheimer who is covered in bird s***. I feel these things really hurt the film. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and finally seemed to be showing his age. McKellen is tired and slow in this film, Gandalf is not the same great warrior. Finally, this film is different because we know it's a prequel. Even if you didn't read the book, you know who lives and who dies, taking a major play away from the screenwriters. Overall the Hobbit is somewhat entertaining, but it's not The Lord of The Rings. It's directionless at times, lacks the urgency needed for an epic, and has a cast that really doesn't excite. I was hoping for a lot, but all I got was a little. The only thing I can do now is try and forget about it as I wait for the next film with anticipation.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|this game is cool it is so so so very very cool indeed i like it a lot i will play it some more

B00CHS31DG|4.0|This is a fun app. Creepy as h#ll.<br /><br />We've played with it on a number of occasions, and it does say some things that are eerie. I do not really believe in paranormal stuff,and I have to admit that these guys have made an app that will occasionally make me question this mindset due to the accuracy of the words it captures.<br /><br />I'd recommend it for anyone that wants a fun little app to run in the background, and occasionally check to feel a little creeped out.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The Master of legal intrigue does it again!  How many things can go wrong for a case, but still be saved by the Street Lawyer and his teammates seeking fairness?  Masterfully written Mr Grisham.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|After a few predictable stories, John Grisham has come back with one that took me to the end of the book with a surprise.  The characters were familiar, and yet they all were a little out of their comfort zones.  The re-introduction of Lucian Wilbanks and his part kept things interesting.  This was true John Grisham writing.  Once you started reading you wanted to keep going to see what came next because it wasn't easy to figure out.  I do hope there is more of this to come.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great Drama comes from great writing, great plot, and great acting.  &#34;The Good Wife&#34; has all of these required features in great abundance.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|As with every new Preston Child offering I closeted myself in order to read it to the end in private. But about half way through (just about mid-Sherlock Holmes story) I knew I had to set it aside and SAVOUR the rest, so I could make the most of this particular reading experience and TRY to figure out what was happening next. So I just read a few pages a day and let the prose sort of roll around inside my head a bit. And while I did identify the bad guy pretty quickly, it was a total pleasure letting the authors reveal the truth of the plot layer by layer. As the title of the review states, this was a rich story that entertained and intrigued. I highly recommend it to all. Oh and by the way... does anyone else out there think Benedict Cumberbatch would be a PERFECT Pendergast in a movie version?
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Entire family loved it.  wished I purchased the movie instead of renting it.  I hope there is a squeal to this movie.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book has all the elements that make an enjoyable read. It is smart, perceptive, thoughtful and tender, without being sappy.
B001OI6YJI|2.0|This movie is pretty horrible. I love Kirk Douglas and I love this brand of oold fashioned sci fi but this just doesn't work... first the robot - the design is so terrible - so visually off - that it dtracts completely from any possible menace. Farah Fawcett topless for two seconds can't make up for the convoluted plot and terrible special fx.
0393072231|5.0|this book explains to the layperson much of what went on in 2008. And it gives good snapshots of some of the heroes involved...
B00BEF1AEK|2.0|The game itself is halfway clever, so it gets two stars, but there is no way to actually exit the game without force closing it. That is an instant uninstall and will be avoiding this dev in the future.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The mouse is solid and the buttons have discreet response.  I use my mouse wheel a lot and I can hear it squeek a bit when I'm scrolling up very quickly, but I'll hold conclusion on that.  I do like the fact that you can change sensitivity on the fly with a button click.<br /><br />I've had multiple Microsoft mice whose mouse wheels become unresponsive or gummy feeling (probably due to the rubber band around the wheel itself.  And this mouse doesn't look like it will suffer the same fate.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a very good compromise of price and functionality.  Most other gaming mice are 50%-100% or more in price.

B001CDWFPC|3.0|Let it be known that I use this as my everyday bible.  The only issues that I have is that you can see bias in some of the commentary. See Acts 2:38 commentary and the author affiliation.  I wish there had been better peer review by others before printing.  Some verses clearly talking about baptism just dismiss the idea that the verse is even referring to the act.<br /><br />Again, I love the information and organization of this bible but just know you might encounter this.

B008EEZ64Y|4.0|The drawings fit the theme perfectly—washed out grey—but they are few and far between, and the edition has some light typos. I don't understand why eBooks are still exempt from proper proofing and copy editing; especially one as iconic as The Giver.<br /><br />I'm still waiting to get an eBook that has digital heft: the psychological equivalent of a well-produced hardcopy.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It is a great book, and it is clearly a follow up to A Time to Kill. I felt that the end was a bit too contrived so that all of the loose ends tied up for a happy ending. While a good novel does just that , it seemed a bit contrived.

006202406X|4.0|I just finished Allegiant and came to Amazon expecting to find glowing reviews, and am shocked that so many people hate it.  I read Divergent as a school librarian, curious to see what it was all about, and liked it but didn't love it. I thought the writing was a little stilted, the many characters confused me, and the atmosphere was relentlessly bleak. Insurgent didn't change my opinion of the series; still liked, but didn't love.  Somehow Allegiant brought it all together for me, and I loved this book. Ms. Roth's writing has matured and become focused, and I love where the story went and how the world opened up, both literally and atmospherically. Their world is still a small one; baby steps for us, but expanding quickly for those characters, and I was impressed by her restraint in not over-describing the mind-blowing changes they go through.  I can see that other readers may find the writing style to be underwhelming or dull, but as a journalist I appreciate a &#34;just the facts&#34; approach so that I can fill in my own details and create a reading experience for myself.<br /><br />As for the unexpected major character's death, I was shocked and sad, but it worked for me.  This reminds me of the varied reactions of readers to Mockingjay; you either loved it or you hated it.  Sudden senseless death was part of their world.  The idea that she may have been immune to the death serum was more of a stretch for me than that she could possibly skate through all danger with no consequences. The world that Roth created throughout the trilogy should have left no doubt that change could not come without sacrifice.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Another great album from Fall Out Boy. The tracks on this album are killer! I can't get enough of this album. Out of all of their albums I'd rank this 3rd all time. Several years after their debut and they're still bringing the hits.

For those hesitating to watch this movie, go out and get it and be prepared to be captivated.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I was sure of the plot very early on but still enjoyed the entire book. Not as well spun as most of grisham's books that I've read.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Actually watched when first released with mostly glowing ratings. I realize factors other than the movie itself can influence the viewing enjoyment. Since INDEPENDANT DAY is one of my all-time favs. I decided to wait and watch again. It was as horrific the second time. Of course I never expected the story to be realistic. But, it's the character's response to basically every single event which makes this movie nothing other than silly and utterly stupid. Since there are so many scenes from which I can chose, I will limit it to a couple. Apparently, Channing Tatum is &#34;faster than a speeding bullet&#34; saving the president's son while running/shielding him against several terrorist shooting automatic weapons point blank in a single room. Bruce Willis may have pulled off similar feats, but he at least suffered a wound or two. This is my all-time worst movie scene of any movie.  Two cabinet members & the president each know one of  three codes for releasing nukes. Most know this is the terrorist's demand.  The female (forgive me if I have her title wrong) sec. of defense is kicking, screaming and fighting &#34;torture&#34; to the brink of death as the president gives the okey-dokey  to negotiate w/ terrorists. Her first statement after certain death is &#34;how's my hair?&#34; Come on! I have never degraded another viewer's review. I just can't understand why anyone would give this 5 stars unless they're a teenage boy. I'm not insulting anyone who loved this movie. I just can't understand. I'm sure many hated various movies I loved. This movie certainly was not for me. And, I honestly tried twice to enjoy.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A good Grisham book. A very slow start but ends as really fast-moving and exciting. Paradoxically, the social issues presented at the beginning finish on a bland note. A good read, but could have been great. Read &#34;The Help,&#34;  Mr. Grisham, and you'll see what I mean.
B00EVN2D3O|5.0|Great magic movie.  Love the cast and characters.  Love the extras also.  Very exciting and funny, exactly what I love!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great game that is fun to play as well as cheap on your wallet. love this game. you must buy this game.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|Love John Cusack...this movie was exciting...the effects were kind of crazy.  Overall, I liked it!  Loved the arcs and the alternate ending.
B00DJYJPLO|4.0|not particularly fond of shouting marital differences.. earlier ones were more tender.. tho' this did have many moments.. certainly worth at least 4 1/2  stars...
B003P2WO5E|3.0|First 800 pages are a giant, boring, world-building prologue.  The end is awesome.  The series will probably be awesome, too, since the world-building is all out of the way.  Badly planned book, though.  Would have been way more interesting if the story had progressed more and the world-building had been woven in.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Pleasantly surprise. I've only used it to downloaded videos to mp3 format, but love it. No glitches, no problems. Easier and faster than the program I use on my desktop. Thanks! Very nice job!
B000MR9D5E|4.0|it was exactly what i wanted and i would recommend it to any one wanting to expand their knowledge of planet earth
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it, love it, love it!!  Can't wait for the new season!<br />Like a good book, you wish it would never end!!
B002UZXJA6|4.0|it was exactly what i wanted and i would recommend it to any one wanting to listen to celtic women singing
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|I think this is a great game worth the price with more hero's and new towers it's a must buy game.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This is a fun tale of mystery and history. It as a fun read. Lots of people complained about buying it on the Kindle, because it includes pictures. I did not find it to be a problem like others did.
B002N14GPE|4.0|Excellent suspense film with intriguing plot twists. It basically takes a somewhat improbable series of events and helps the watcher to suspend their disbelief.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I love Modern Family! This is a fun family comedy. Keeps me laughing but also tends to make me cry. It is true to life and over the top. A great show.
B000GWE44U|5.0|A classic that deserves to be watched over and over again. While many people don't care for Jack Nicholson's performance, he embodied the character as I visualized it when I read the book.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Educating and illuminating, this book keep me surprised. I really enjoyed this book, it is hard to remember that it is a true story. Unbelievable.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was so looking forward to reading this and was disappointed with the disjointed storyline and ending. I get it, not everyone gets a happy ending, but it doesn't keep me from wanting one. The whole thing was a mess and completely unsatisfying.
0743454537|5.0|An amazing tale of how one family struggles to survive with a terminally ill child. Very heartwarming and heart wrenching at the same time,
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A wonderful end to the trilogy.  It was moving and such a strong story.  The characters are so identifiable and so visual.
144471032X|5.0|Very easy and well explained book, with good recipes!  I enjoyed reading! Doing the diet and losing weight and also my husband
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book, this series, I love it all. I recommend this book to everyone. I 're-read the book before the movie came out so that I could compare. This book is my favorite of the trilogy. All I can say is SIMPLY AMAZING!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Masterful.  As a storyteller, there is none better than Bryson.  The book excels on many levels.  It is page turning history. It is vastly entertaining biography.  It is beautifully written with wit, style and humor.  It is a work that exemplifies insight and scholarship. I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />K. McMeans
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun to play so far. Easy to learn and appropriate for all ages.  Much better then the one I played on Facebook.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Love this movie and Denzel!  Perfect evening movie to sit and take it all in.  Watch it.  Great movie.  You'll see.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love the characters, the action and the story line.  It really makes you think about what you would do if put into the same situation.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Came in greatThis movie came with another item. Great packaging. Protected. Great movie and I always like liam neeson movies.  So action packed  Very well protected.
B001OGTQRC|3.0|As an album by Testament, I love this. Great riffs and songs that stick in your head. But this mixing of it? What monkey is responsible for this? You could take a cassette version, run it through an average DAW and do better. Volume levels are not consistent from one song to the next. A redo would do this fine album better justice.
030789701X|4.0|It is a HUGE book.  So many tips on how to play and where all the tricks are.  If you play a lot,get the book
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I enjoyed this series.  It was entertaining and the costumes were excellent.  The Characters could be more developed but it was something to watch while I wait for the new season of Downton Abbey
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This is a beautifully written and very thought provoking book.<br />I cried lots of tears but couldn't put it down.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I've never watched a Denzel movie that I didn't like, and this one was no let down.  Denzel always brings it.  Great movie, give it a watch.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|Love their sound. Like every song on the album and just keep listening to it on repeat. Kangaroo Court is the best and just wants me to get up and dance. Thank you, Capital Cities, for your fresh fun sound and unique layers.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is lots of fun and very challenging on some levels.  Now I understand why so many people like it so much!
B00BU18U82|4.0|very good app you have to buy some tractors and bigger plows with real money but over all a very good app
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Got boring really quick. I had deleted it the same day as I downloaded it. I would not download it again.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Its not often that I write reviews. But this movie blew me away. It shows some real stuff that humans can go through. It touches on addiction, tragedy, trauma, honesty and love. I laughed, I cried, I was scared and even mad. Denzel nailed this one. A must see!
B007ZB06OW|5.0|Because the price was right and it was something I was looking for I had a model when I was younger
0393061310|5.0|Amazing book that explains the rise of western civilization as we see it today. Accounts for domestication of plants and animals and why one continent got a kick-start compared to another. The middle east has huge advantages over Europe or the Americas as the confluence of variety in animals and in cultures. Many things were tried and some succeeded. It explains a lot without talking about insanities like racial supremacy or manifest destiny.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I really liked this game it's very addicting and I don't like that many games and don't get addicted to a bunch of games I really enjoyed how they put dinosaurs in the game so you can learn about the dinosaur and there names! If your looking for an awesome.and addicting game this it!! Thanks-jillian Aubrey
B00BU1DG1S|5.0|Mind altering confusion in the very best way.<br />Delicate hints of the Culture, a scattered, fragmented, multiplicity, driving a dark totalitarian future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put it down. Even when I wasn't reading I was thinking about this book. A great story about courage and survival. Katniss is truly a girl on fire. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to read something different that is suspenseful and unpredictable. I'm am now going to read the next in the series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book! It is such a heart stopper, you don't know what happens next, truly amazing! Highly recommended
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|One of the greatest games ever. I like this game because it is so detailed and very artistic. This game is very fun to have and you will not regret buying it.
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|I wish I hadn't read this one. Sparks is a good writer, but the ending leaves you with a sense of hopelessness, and the last paragraph is just strange. As others have described, once I suspected where Sparks was going with the ending, I had to skip ahead to see if he would really damage the characters like that. It's as if the first 90% is a book filled with hope, long-lost love, and a little melancholy -- then the last 10% becomes this violent depressing mess. You're expected to feel for characters that were barely mentioned before the end of the book, and to say you don't get closure is an understatement.<br /><br />Part of the issue is the summary/back cover of the book doesn't really match the genre or tone of the story. It's as if this was marketed as a heartwarming romance, when it's actually veering a little too much into violence and the paranormal.<br /><br />Just my opinion, but if you're looking for an uplifting book filled with hope, this is not it!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was very good and a fast read.  I can't think of one book this man wrote that I didn't like.
B005K17RU0|1.0|It is a shame you have code in your app that allows these nuisance adds to run. And to remove them you have to but the version where adds are disabled
B007URVZJ6|5.0|A great helping hand to learning more about setting up and preparing my book for Kindle format. Thanks for putting this together!
B009AY04A8|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is very fun. Lots of different characters. Great for training your eyes to see things you wouldn't normally notice.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|It's been awhile since I've played a game that held my attention the entire time.  This game has it all.  It does have some hidden object scenes, but they are pretty good.  If you want to play a game that keeps your attention, has a great story line and some really nice music....this is the game for you.  You won't be disappointed.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I haven't listened to Stryper in years. However their latest release is going to be playing for quite a while. Im loving the fact that in our music today metal has lost its way, its become dark, ugly, with no talent to showcase unless you just want to show how fast you can drum and run your fingers up and down the frets. And as far as good vocals go , forget it everyone wants to yell and scream and sing like their choking to death. It has been the older bands that continue to make a comeback and show how its suppose to be done. 80's style.<br /><br />  Stryper has done this with No More Hell To Pay....this is a great album and exemplifies what a good metal album should sound like today. Even if your not Christian , youll get a nod for buying this baby cause its got all the goods!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Super fun grate game I can play all day I just wish the energy didn't run out it could be better
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|My daughter love this. I think there should be more to it tho. Like side games or fun little puzzles
B002FQOI0A|5.0|OMG, this is such a good book. I'm eleven years old, and this book is just fantastic!! To is my favorite book after the hunger games!!!!!! When my younger sister is older, I'll tell her to read this book! Fantastic
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is ABSOLUTELY entertaining and fun but I highly recommend you proceed with caution because it's highly addictive......I can't stop playing..LOL!!!!!
B002RI9M2U|3.0|This book is not the best book I've read, but it's not bad. To me, it's confusing to know what part is the kid is talking and what part is the tape record playing. I think that could have been I bit more clear, the idea is great though. A lot of emotion contains this book, sort of an over exaggerated time of high school. Over all, the book is nice, but not in my top favorites.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game. So addicting. Sometimes frustrating when it takes 20 days to pass a level, but who wants a quickie !!!<br />.
0380715430|5.0|A wonderful book. Bill Bryson's humor and style of writing always guarantee a wonderful read, but this was a particularly enjoyable book. If you're a stickler about pronunciation (as I was), this book may knock you off your high horse. It's fascinating how fluid the English language is--and to learn how it got that way. Highly recommended.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Heartfelt story, it's the unthinkable....unimaginable. Leaves you thinking about it for days, asking why.  Truly makes you appreciate the small things in life.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great story, acting and lots of surprises. Looking forward to watching season 2. It is the best series I've watched.
1476727651|5.0|The question is how many more books is Stephen King going to come up with. It was worth the buy.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Would have been higher, but it should be entitled &#34;Alcoholism&#34; -- I feel the &#34;Flight&#34; part was actually a detail to the real theme of the story.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|You will not find a better movie/ Comic book company than Marvel. Robert was amazing. You will not find a better movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great improvements on this app.  Love it. Easy to use and to navigate. Kudos to the Weather Channel for doing a great job.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|This BAD concert is the best concert ever. End of debate. Watch it and you will not be disappointed. Get ready for experiencing the most inspiring things you have ever seen or heard.<br /><br />Michael Jackson is the greatest ever. Words can't describe.
B003G4W49C|4.0|The author sets up the book and works on character development from the beginning.  Good book.  However the end seemed like a poorly thought out cliffhanger.  I enjoyed reading it but would not read it again like other classics.
B00DT99BX6|4.0|Not just a romance, Pawn of Innocence is a thriller. Young Camile desperately yearns to escape the tight security cocoon in which she lives. Years before, her wealthy father's business ventures created deadly enemies, who are bent on revenge, stalking Camile wherever she goes. Against the secuded reality of her life, Camile chases the elusive dream for a normal life, bringing danger closer.<br /><br />Chameleon has crafted an excellent page turner that you will not want to miss.  (This review pertains to the revised version.)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for bringing Candy Crush to Kindle! I have been waiting a while for it to come to Kindle. I love it.
B009PLO2RW|4.0|Inspired by a true story of Danièle Delpeuch, who was a personal chef for French president François Mitterrand for two years, French comedy drama “Les saveurs du Palais” (aka “Haute Cuisine”) shows us how cooking can change your life in an unexpected way. The film suffers from heavy-handed narrative structure, and is reticent about several aspects of her job, but the star Catherine Frot almost single-handedly carries the film, as the heroine whose personality and professionalism is the greatest asset of the film.<br /><br />Catherine Frot (“Chaos” “A Page Turner”) is Hortense Laborie, a chef working at the French base at the Crozet Islands. Her one-year contract is about to end, and she will be leaving the sub-Antarctic islands. This alone is already impressive, but her career is much more extraordinary, as back in France Hortense was working at the Élysée Palace, cooking all the meals for the President (Jean d'Ormesson) and his guests.<br /><br />The film goes back and forth between two narrative threads, one set in Paris and the other in the Crozet Islands, but I don’t see the point of telling her great story in this way. Director Christian Vincent (“The Discreet” “The Separation”) has carefully removed political things from the story, and the president (played by writer Jean d'Ormesson) looks more like a schoolteacher than a politician. The medical condition of Mitterrand, who had a cancer, is only vaguely suggested.<br /><br />“Les saveurs du Palais” is still an enjoyable film with effective supports from Hippolyte Girardot and Arthur Dupont. The film is as light as a soufflé, and fun to watch.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Incredibly complex plot and characters galore. I had to make notes when I began reading so that I could keep all of the characters straight. Once I became familiar with everyone, the reading became easier. I enjoyed the challenge. I came to know and care about each character: loving some and hating others. That's what a great author does. Put these characters into intense situations, and you have a winning combination. The story is tight; everything fits perfectly. My hat is off to the author and all those involved in publishing this book.<br />The one drawback that I need to mention is that I spoke with someone who has read all of the other books in the series. She told me not to waste my time reading the rest because it's been 5 years or so since the last in the series was published. Really? Step it up, Mr. Martin and publishing team. You risk losing your readers.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|An excellent read. An interesting story woven over time with justice delivered .... As it should be. I highly recommend this book.
B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|Love this movie and am happy with the different formats.  Am happy with the great story line and all the comedy in it. Great movie for both adults and kids.
B004Z4LZ7E|5.0|Very concise book related to the movie concept art, enough information to the fans and understandable English for the non anglo speakers like me. At least in my personal case the book fulfill my expectations, thanks.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I have absolutely loved this series!! It is my favorite series of all! The action, the romance, the mystery....I am so sad it's over but can't help but *sigh* smile at the ending:) and I don't think you could ever find a character quite as dreamy as Aidan:) *sighs again, and smiles bigger*
159463176X|4.0|Wonderfully drawn characters and intriguing storyline. Enlightening view inside a very different culture. Liked how the book followed certain characters over an extended number of years.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Not to many movies like this scares me but this did the job. So make sure you are not alone when you watch it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Like this version without linking Facebook to it. I hate depending on others to advance on to the next level.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So far I am well pleased. I like that I can read off line with the bible version of my choice. Not all, but the majority of them are available for of line reading. All that is required is that you create an account with YouVersion and more features is available to you. Very simple to use. I like the daily scripture and chapter reading posted when you open the app. No Bible dictionaries, but that wasn't too disappointing to me. My main focus was to find a Bible that is easy to use anywhere with the flexibility of quick switching Bible versions. It takes time to find the right one to fit your needs, but this one is for me. I'm so glad I don't have to look no farther.  Try it out! It will only cost you a little of your time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this book! It was a book that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole book !
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was grateful to have found this book. I felt like I was staring into a beautiful painting for 16 hours and seeing new things about it every minute. I loved the zigzaging timelime...organized chaos...utopia! I recommend this book to anyone that is a dreamer.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|my freinds told me this was a great game I disagree. this game is extremley over rated boring and genarly quite dumb. my cousin is over obsessed with this and it Makes me HATE him this is possibly the worst game ever?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great saga. We enjoyed season 1,2, & 3.  Looking forward to Season 4.  The acting was believable and scenery so real.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I can see how many were dissapointed with the ending. Some like their stories tidied up and and fully concluded. For me, this ending said the plot line's insanity would continue however you would like to imagine, and that's fully plausible.  As the book brings us through the highly dysfunctional relationship between Amy and Nick I found myself investing my emotions in the characters' daily dealings. Their parties and relationship details were hauntingly familiar. Even Nick's sister, Go, had a familiar comfortableness as if I knew her, knew her mannerisms. Investing your emotions in the characters of a novel, pulling for them, hissing them, is a sign of a well written work one would think. By the end though I found this to be a good novel. I would recommend it to anyone and follow up with a \\"I really enjoyed it.\\" I fully do not agree with many 1 star reviews here.<br /><br />I'm not one to dole out the five star ratings for everything under the sun. The Sound and the Fury is a five star book, Crime and Punishment is a five star book. Gone Girl gets three from me as a book I enjoyed.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|If they say it l would believe it.  I love the clear and concise way the information is laid out and presented.  Definitely an A+ APP.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Once again Khaled Hosseini doesn't disappoint.  I couldn't put the book down and wished each person's story could go on a bit more.
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|I am so bummed this is the third and &#34;final&#34; book!! I want more!!! As promised it's filled with action and meaning. It is so fun to imagine myself in their world, which is honestly really easy to do, great writing , great story line, wonderful message. I just can't say enough good things, I really enjoyed the book and it was worth the wait! I'm keeping my fingers crossed for more!!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|wouldn't mind the glue credits being a little more forthcoming but this game is great! replayability is through the roof.
B000244EMO|5.0|This is one of if not my favorite movies.<br />I owned it on DVD anddecided to upgrade and get this edition.<br /><br />Ths is an action filled movie with a hint of sci-fi in it. Arnold is at his best in this feature. And the picture quality is really good as well.<br /><br />Bottom line...this is a buy.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|For the non-technical - HDMI puts the HD in your HDTV.  Great price, Great Value. Great Quality.  The Sony DVP-500H needs this item so order them both.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I like Yahoo but i do not like the ads that pop up in the inbox. I wish it would show how many spam emails like it shows for other folders.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Very uplifting true story of a lady with Autism who was able to use her special talents to make her way and improve the world. Claire Danes was superb as Temple Grandin. It also showed what a difference a devoted and loving parent can make in a child's life with special needs.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|Even though the head cleaner was a bit pricy, it did the job that I bought it for.  I guess this is what happens when products go off of the market, the price is jacked up!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game play is similar to Fishdom so I little trouble getting started.  I am not too far along, but I sense a winner.
B008JFUQZ2|3.0|This is an odd film; extremely well made, superb special effects, good cast, good action and acting but......Here is why I only gave<br />it three stars.  The plot seems strange; the humans build monster size robots to fight monsters from beneath the  ocean.  Unlike<br />Godzilla, Rodan and the like, the monsters are mortal and can be killed.  Why not just develop super weapons to blow the  things<br />apart?  This film reminded me of the Japanese monster films laced in with the Transformer movies.  Even Hong Kong gets mushed<br />up Tokyo-like in the movie; well done but I think a bit of plagerism.  Still,  enjoyed the film because of the effects and action though<br />again I find the story overly fancyfull.  Warner Bros with Legendary Pics made the movie.  I wonder if they are setting the stage for<br />a reported new Godzilla movie supposedly in  the wings?  Only the shadow knows.  Enjoy!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|It seems that Ivan is taking over where Miles Vorkosigan has left off. Another intrigue with many threads to unravel!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Desktop streaming isn't working as well as it could.  I have audio problems while using it but anything out of chrome works like a champ.
B00APACSJG|5.0|Classic Miles!<br />He's in an unfamiliar situation, then he ends up running the show! I've been waiting for a while for this book!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|It is funny it is awesome  fun for me and my kids to read we laugh out loud  It is a good book
B008602KQI|3.0|computer messed up and did not get to see the last hour so can not give it a true rating
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Her story is miraculous.  I was impressed with the multicultural and religious beliefs she had to incorporate into her life..many contradicting the other.<br />I wish I could have the clarity in my life as she was given in her Nde.  She tries to make to make it clear that we just to need to love ourselves and let the thoughts and experiences of this life pass through...not losing sight that we just need to love ourselves and everything else will take care of itself.  I want to get that simplicity imbedded in me.  I need to let go of my negative thoughts, past, and self judgments...they seem to have a hold on me.  I hope in going into the quiet space each day and asking for help in just really loving myself....I will work into this divine tapestry she describes.  I do believe that our thoughts transcend our wellness.  I also believe that cancer is a western disease and for all the reasons she wrote.  Namaste
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was one of those books that you hate to put down.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to k ow what will happen next.  I must admit that  I have read most if not all of John Grisham's books but think this is among the best of them.  You would not go wrong by getting this book.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|this stupid thing is stupid. it doesn't give you a good amount of time. in fact it shouldn't even give you a time should just let you play as long as you want.  STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID.
B004QHK986|5.0|CD+DVD(live in Madrid) combo. Plus MP3 versions of the DVD Tracks (that is, if you don't have the knowledge to extract the audio from the DVD and make it pure FLAC or any lossless format you wish) you won't go wrong with this one, especially if you get it for under $15. You get the original &#34;A thousand Suns&#34; and a DVD region 0 (playable anywhere you are) with the show. I think I don't need to say anything else, I'm too much of a LP fan to keep it unbiased hehe.
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|Felt the book was trying to be too tidy. Became predictable as the story was being steered and all loose ends tied up. Knew how everything would end at the half way point and there was no usual flare for drama or exciting twist.
B009O36EO0|5.0|First heard Loreen's songs from a compilation of european hits, remixed. After lots of compilations featuring Loreen, never getting disappointed by her songs, I decided to find out about her and her career. What a shocking surprise, to say the least. Then I went for her CD, a hard thing to find in the US for a reasonable price, if you ask. All I could find was european stores, or american stores charging a premium for the import, then, there was Amazon and I bought it here, from another seller though, the price difference was to big :(<br /><br />Straight to the CD, well, my first impression was &#34;Could be better&#34;, but it happened because I was used to listening to her remixes. then the original songs always seems &#34;lacking&#34; something. But in this case, they don't. On another day I was calm and decided to listen to it again. THAT was &#34;the moment reality struck me&#34;. After that I started to appreciate the original songs a lot more, started to understand her work and the way she made this CD. Given by the tracks on this CD, I can tell she meant to show us that she can perform well on every rhythm, there's some upbeat songs, like &#34;If she's the one&#34;, &#34;euphoria&#34;, and some songs that are better enjoyed if you're alone, or relaxed, like &#34;heal&#34;. Wish Loreen had more exposition outside Europe though.
B000AMJC2K|3.0|The vertical adjustment is difficult, it requires supporting the monitor and depressing a release button at the first elbow joint behind the monitor the button is extremely hard to push in, and it actually required padded channel lock pliers. If not for that issue I would have given it 5 stars.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Minutes to Midnight is a very good album, but it's not the &#34;old&#34; LP from Meteora and Hybrid Theory anymore. And I think that the fans made too much of a fuss for the explicit lyrics. There is a light version of the album, but it isn't the same thing, not only because of the censorship applied but because it's not the way the artist meant to express his song, &#34;it wasn't written like that&#34;.<br /><br />Anyway, From all the songs in the album, the one I didn't like a lot was &#34;Valentine's Day&#34; (coming from a single guy it may seem like a grudge though) because I simply couldn't understand the true meaning of the lyrics. Oh well... one day I shall understand it, or not.<br /><br />Aside from this particular song, the others, for me, are either good or epic. What I've Done is an example of that.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're a fan of Linkin Park and their constant changes, AND if you find this CD for $5 with AutoRIp included (like I did), why not add it to your collection?
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Poor Ending....<br />I was disappointed. Too many loose ends not tied together<br />The first 2 books were so much better!
B00D4E9BDQ|5.0|I enjoyed every track on the record.  It was a great buy.  If you are not sure if you want to buy it you can listen to alot of their music from their soundcloud page.  You will also be able to hear their new and upcoming stuff.
B00EP22QKG|5.0|Great new CD by Joan & The Blackhearts; catchy, driving rock, you'll be singing in your car.  I hope it gets the radio play it deserves.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|What a wonderful movie!  This is the princess movie I would have loved as a kid.  She doesn't have to be super girly or be saved by a man.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Great movie. Humour is fantastic in this and it's good enough to hold most adults attention as well as children. 3d version is great, though not as visually stunning as &#34;Legend of the Guardian&#34; which still holds one of the highest places (in MY opinion) for graphical amazing-ness out of the animated movies. Though, the art and colour used is phenomenal in this. Good stuff for the whole family!
1419705849|5.0|Kids love this book and the series. One student got his book stolen so I purchased this book as a present. He was so happy. Recommend for all students of all ages.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Couldn't vote 1 star because it kicked me out.<br />Skip it if you are concerned about 1984. They want too much personal information to download it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy crush saga,liked this game,lovely bright colours,this game can be very addictive in a good way,great for young ones in a good way.
B000003N7F|5.0|A classic and an essential album for any Jazz Enthusiast's collection. John was a man on a spiritual mission and way ahead of his time in terms of creative innovation in music. This album is an American treasure and a gift to be enjoyed for generation long after we're gone.
B0068RHSCW|5.0|Dream House was one of the best Movies that I've watched in years. It's the kind of movie that you can't figure out, that's the best kind. The actors were all amazing....I couldn't help but weep many times for this man. Please enjoy....
B0055SWM08|5.0|a very good mind theory game. I would recommend this game and the method of progressing in the game can be mind boggling  and it is worth it at the end
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Outstanding program that I find essential for working with Word docs. If your using an Android tablet and need to work with Word, PowerPoint or PDFs, I would urge you to have a look at D2G.
0765325950|5.0|A fantastic end to the series. So many waited for so long, and I, at least, was among the satisfied.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson, while his &#34;voice&#34; was clearly distinguishable at moments, did a masterful job weaving whatever fragments and notes he had into an end that left tears in my eyes.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love it! This is a really fun game, my 3 year old grand daughter loves it! She plays it all by herself I just help with the reading and quests....
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is such a great game but on my kindle it lags plz fix and when is the update coming ?
B00BATKPBE|4.0|Richard Dawkins is a fascinating character who recounts the events of his childhood, family and career in this interesting memoir. I've been a Dawkins lover for many years, completely charmed by his witty prose, unorthodox ideas and impatience with everything irrational, so I suppose I was expecting his memoir to be outrageously witty, unorthodox and impatient. It's a good memoir, but not a great one. He shortchanges his personal relationships and we hear very little about his marriages and home life and a good deal about his colleagues and work life. Not that it's not interesting. It is! If I had expected less, I might have given this book more stars. Nonetheless, it is well worth your time to read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game we enjoyed trying to complete one level before going to sleep each night and are looking forward to more levels.
B0091X74II|3.0|The visuals are amazing but the script is horrible. The cast was terrific but they had very little to work with.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I was surprised. This is one of the best novels I've read in a while. Not only was it entertaining but it was very informative. I learned a lot about flowers.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|What a great prequel to Wizard of Oz. James Franco is a legend in his own time. Visuals were outstanding.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Loved this movie, great acting, very funny. The part at the airport was great. 5 star movie. must see. great actions.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|worth watching over and over again. Celtic woman have become my favorite group and I plan on watching it everywhere. I play it on my laptop
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game.  I loved it .  Where is enigmatic 2.  I'm ready to play.  I will be waiting to hear that the new game is out.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My youngest grandson requested this game.  He do not go a day without playing spider-man..  Some days that Is all that he play.  It is a great game.  TRY IT.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, I play everyday & all night. Very addictive but fun game for any age. So join in.
1905236042|5.0|Fantastic item to purchase for a parent, teacher, club/activity group, etc.!<br />I purchased these for use & development of my masters thesis research with my special education students (research on mindfulness practice as increasing autonomy for students with special needs).<br /><br />I tested these cards out prior to use with my students and had a ball!<br />I ended up randomly pulling out cards to create a 'surprise' routine for myself, and found it really expanded my yoga abilities and practice. As an adult you can make it challenging, despite the fact that it is intended for younger ages!<br /><br />When aimed at using with children - multiple ages and abilities ok! - students/children can pull random cards to create a fun routine as well.  Cards allow for single person, paired or small group, game-style 'work', play, etc.<br />COMPLETELY WORTH THE PURCHASE if you are interested in yoga, kinesthetic learning, and even 'meditative focus' curriculums!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Luv this book. Told my son about it& he read it on his kindle & the book. Last week at school his teacher played the movie in class.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've always felt that &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; was Grisham's best novel.  I've read a few of his later ones and although interesting, they've seemed &#34;formulaec&#34; (spelling?).  In Sycamore Row, Grisham goes back to the Mississippi lawyer who tried the case in  A Time To Kill and although Sycamore Row is not a sequel, there are helpful allusions to that first novel.<br /><br />Still Sycamore Row stands very much on it's own and I found myself reading it and thinking about it constantly.  It's true that I'm also a lawyer and handle a lot of estate planning and  administration cases so I found it particularly interesting to me.  I was troubled by some &#34;ex parte&#34; communications with the judge but maybe that's just done there in Mississippi.  I don't think it's done here in Richmond but who knows, maybe it is, and I'm just not in the loop.  Also,  I, as a lawyer, would have loved to learn how the big time lawyers could have saved the decedent so much in estate taxes when he died unmarried (and unwilling to do anything before death) and all but maybe I'm just not aware of some of the tricks for single, very wealthy testators.<br /><br />Back to Sycamore Row, I found it extremely interesting, heart warming and exciting--well written and very much true to reality.

B00DIFARQ6|3.0|This game is cool but it sucks that you only get two missions!! You have to pay for the rest. Didn't buy the whole thing but 99 cents didn't hurt.
B009NNMB70|5.0|I took my granddaughter and her friend to see this movie and I became a fan after watching it. This DVD will be under the Christmas tree for her along with other 1D things. She will be so happy.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this app its really coolly and I was going to buy it before our trip for thanksgiving for my cousins when we get their but I want it to be a secret I don't know though if they want to play on my Kindle fire I will let them play this game because it is really awesome!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an excellent game and better than the one on facebook.  Very easy to install and play.  I would recommend it to all.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|I have every album KT has ever done, including live and limited releases. She can do no wrong. This one has nothing that grabs me like Black Horse did - but I love nonetheless!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I liked the game on FB, but this one is much  better. Good graphics, o my mi us I can do d is that most is expensive and the storage problem is little issue<br />.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Lorde will be with us for some time to come. Neither her voice nor her lyrics seem to be from such a young artist. I cannot wait to hear what else she brings us.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am not a gamer per se, but I find this is a great way to 're-start&quot; my brain, it is the perfect few minutes break I need during the day.<br />I find when a take a break and play Candy Crush I am more mentally alert and can focus more completely on the task at hand.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I liked the writers laid back style and plot twists that brought the pieces together at the end in a fulfilling way. I did feel a little like it was built up more than was delivered as far as the theme and initial promise went but nevertheless and excellent story  and well worth the read.  Anyone who likes a well-told story would enjoy reading this book.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|knew program from school-UCSF. to get these so easily, & The variety, without searching around or having to endure long drawn out films, courses or documentaries, these are all The reasons. oh, & to be able to download them for offline use, which is convenient & saves battery life. very nice.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|LOVE this app. Clean, user-friendly, great organization. Super Kindle app. Never read blogs except through Feedly. Easy install. Fun to use!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's very addictive and fun I play head to head with other people who have temple run its a very fun way to play.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|The later books are better developed, but this is definitely the start of something worth following. Nice to see Harry when he still has a bit of innocence which he never quite loses. The Rey accurate alcoholic scenes are painful...
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is the best game ever I love it it is fun and keeps you busy working on killing people and infecting people it's not boring but some time it can be I would give this 5  stars out  of 5 that's my rating
B008JFUPFI|5.0|We all need a hero and there is only one. Superman is by far the hands down favorite and Henry Cavill pulls the character off nicely. Couple that with a decent storyline and todays special effects and it's powerful. He's not your father's Superman either, he plays the role much more seriously. All the former campiness has been removed. I look forward to more.
B00280LYIC|5.0|If you are interested in Greek mythology, you will absolutely love this book. I just learned about it and I love it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It is written with such poetic descriptions. The human condition of feelings, emotions, understandings is tangible. The Book Thief paints a picture of human survival under the dark conditions of Nazi Germany in a sensitive, humorous, and heartbreakingly sad way. Food for thought and discussion. You know it's an important book when you can't stop thinking about •
B00DGABUIC|5.0|It's my lucky toy :)<br /><br />I bring it to my presentation for luck.<br /><br />And I got an A+ for it.<br /><br />It's so cute and so real.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I decided to buy in on this idea while it's still cheap. Opened the box, plugged it in, and after 5 minutes of setup and a software update it was up and running. So far I've tested a lot of Netflix and it's running perfectly. Can't wait to see what Google does with this thing next...
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I just started playing this game n so far I Like this game I would recommend this to my friends
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book gave me a perspective of a what-if scenario in the future. Some fearful, and crazy events that was a definite page turner. I really enjoyed it!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Terrific story well told!<br /><br />I really hated it when I finished the book. The characters, the game, the '80's links - completely awesome.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. it is so awesome and cool.thank you poeple for this game.who ever made this game is smart.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|His earlier books are definitely better but if you are a fan of John Grisham you will enjoy this read. It has the typical lawyer plot and flow of his later books and Not nearly as much action as some of his first stories. I liked that it took place in the same county as A Time To Kill. There some references to that story but you don't have to reread the book to enjoy this story
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't want to play this game because I knew I was going to get addicted to it. Lol<br />Well, I'd do anything for my son, so when he asked me to play it to send him lives, I couldn't say no. Now I'm on it like crazy and like I said, is very addictive. Once you start, you won't stop. The thing that I like most about it, is that it has hundreds of levels. So that's a huge plus for me. Besides, who wants to be stuck playing the same crap over and over again?
B00FMF3R0I|5.0|These recordings just prove why The BEATLES are the best little band in the world, bar none. They have whit, they have talent that just won't quit. I believe  they were put on this earth to just make music. They please me every time I put one of their records on the platter. They don't have a bad song in their catalog. They are the standard. They are the BEST.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Great Movie, lots of fun and very interesting, makes baseball fun to learn about. I enjoyed the friction between the General Manager played by Brad Pit and the Scouts for the Oakland A's.
B000WMA6FA|5.0|The DVD arrived on time, was securely packaged and in perfect condition. The movie was fabulous! I had always wanted to see it, especially after reading the book for the second time after many years. It6 did not dissapoint. Truly a great classic film!
B008LFY6NI|2.0|This &#34;game&#34; is very limited. Although there is an adequate color selection, there is only one media utensil, a paint brush, with three sizes of strokes. Two most annoying things about it - there is no album app or reset button. You cannot save anything you created and if you want to make a new design you have to use the white color and the large brush stroke to &#34;erase&#34; what is on the screen.<br />I have had hours of drawing fun with other apps for the same price. This one is not worth the two bucks.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great packaging, great series, Best acting in years including movies. Maggy smith is astonishingly good.<br />Try it and you will not regret it.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is my favorite author. I love the Scarpetta series. Once I pick up her book I can't put it down until it's completed. She keeps you on the edge of your seat,through plot twists and turns.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|The best sitcom in years, Jim parson's Sheldon cooper is nothing short of brilliant.<br />Recommended to every sitcom love and geek/nerd
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Slow to start going, just got too cheesy for me at the end.  I almost stopped it mid-way through.  Wasted my money.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|When I first started playing this game I was upset because I figured it was another free game that you had to pay to get past levels. When I figured out you could play quests to move on there were no more complaints. Fun, challenging, and super addictive this game will not disappoint.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive, but so much fun.  It gets challenging the further you go.  Just when I think I am stuck on a level forever, I finally get it.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Good story and even better dialogue.  Tom Selleck does a great job of &#34;being&#34; Jesse Stone.<br />I have enjoyed all the Stone Cold movies.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nicely done and seems extremely accurate. I like the in-depth hourly report for the day. It suits my needs and I am sure anyone would like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very fun and exciting game that requires you to think and use your brain.  It is nice to have fun and exercise your brain at the same time. This is game that you don't want to stop playing.  You can get caught up in it very quickly.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|Good acting and delightful film.  LOVE is all consuming.  I hope that more people get to watch and enjoy this adorable film.
0316204366|3.0|This was an easy and entertaining read, but I'm left with no real takeaway. Gladwell is an excellent storyteller, but his attempt at a unifying theme fell flat for me. It's a collection of loosely related vignettes.  If you're looking for an enjoyable way to spend a few hours read it. If you're looking for something profound, look elsewhere.
B000PMFS2I|4.0|It is a fairly good movie, but recommend it for adults only,  Elizabeth Berkley the star does a good job of acting.  She is now perfoming in a TV Show &#34;Dancing with the Star&#34;  (on the ABC network)  she and her dancing partner are the only ones this season to aquire a perfect dance scoring of '10's twice.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|You must see this documentary on SeaWorld.  Seaworld exists to make a lot of money at the expense of suffering animals and safety for the trainers.  Tourists are duped into thinking the performing animals are happy serving as entertainers for humans.  SeaWorld is a place of dark tourism.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun, and it is so easy to use, and learn. I love training my horse. Her name is Beauty. Like I said, it's so fun.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It helped me understand the basic idea of spanish first, then  got really into lots of words! Im addicted to learning off of duolingo!
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|The music on this album is wonderful and the duets are beautiful to hear!  Love listening to all the songs!
B002XXNSF6|1.0|Boring movie. Weak content. Continuous rambling dialogue. I can't believe it is a trilogy. 2 more movies made in the same vane? Yikes.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I read the book when I was 11 years old while living in an orphanage down in Houston, TX, mostly because we had a book case full of Edgar Rice Burroughs books and this one happened to be there…probably one of my first introductions to science-fiction.  It was a flash from my past and I loved it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad this is finally on the Kindle! The app works well and is actually faster than both my Android and Facebook versions.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Can't wait for the movies.  Reviting storyline .  You can't put it down. The characters seem so real that they become friends.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is super fun....u can play for a couple minutes but end up wanting to do it for hours.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love it except the limited and expensive inventory space!<br />Just happy to see this game come out with a mobile version!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like it but it freezes often and logs me off. I don't know if its because of the high speed internet I use or what. Still its great if you have an older tv and want it to function similar to a smart tv.
B0034DGPEU|1.0|The MOST DEPRESSING BOOK from beginning to end.  I kept reading because I had such hope that it would have some sort of happy ending.  It doesn't.  Awful.
B006NYDV7Q|4.0|Having owned and wore out my vinyl version of Heavy Weather I know Palladium is cut off abruptly on the Box set version.<br />The Heavy Weather CD portion of this box set is a clone of the 1997 remaster which has the same problem.<br />Unforgivable in both instances.<br />If you want to hear the correct ending, you will need to purchase the 1990 Import CD (Best of Vol. 1)<br />The original 1997 remaster of Heavy Weather is not up to the quality of the later 2002 remasters of Mysterious Traveler, Tale Spinnin or Black Market. Tracks from the 1990 Import complilation CD (Best of Vol. 1) have better sound.<br />The box set Black Market CD is a clone of the 2002 remaster. 8:30 has improved sound over the 1994 version.<br />Although selected tracks on the other 3 CDs included in this box set use previous remastered version done for subsequent compilations, all tracks are now assembled here remastered.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Truly sucks that Mark died but that's life.<br />Overall, I'm a true fan and still loves reading about Bridget Jones.<br />Fielding's writing is unique and entertaining as always
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|As two months ago I have the Chromecast but still have not seen it work well because when I connect through my laptop which is a MAC does not work well as I drop the signal and even though I have it plugged in a Samsung Smart TV as much as you arrive are a couple of dashes of motioned someone could tell me how do I get him stronger the signal. thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game keeps you coming back and coming back and coming back again and again even when you think you are going to move on to something else  like read a book or go do some job you`like to finish..
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Started out slowly and rather disjointed to end up like some rehash of a bad video game. Waste of time. Special effects gone too far as with the insane fight sequences. Reeve's 1978 Superman will always be the best.
B00F4BJ4M0|5.0|The recordings on this double CD collection are The Beatles during the early part of their career as Beatlemania was just starting to explode in Great Britain and before the four lads took over the United States by storm. Best of all these are live recordings, not studio recordings, that occurred during performances The Beatles made while on the radio on the BBC, aka the British Broadcasting Company. By the time that The Beatles made their appearances on the BBC they were already collecting a fan base of wildly enthusiastic kids who were falling in love with the music as well as with John, Paul, George and Ringo. This is by far the best collection I feel of the early Beatles as they were still developing their style and sound of music. The majority of the songs on these two discs are their covers of songs written by other great rock and roll performers especially on disc 1 with songs written by Little Richard, Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry among others. Most of the songs on the second disc include songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney as they began to get serious in developing their writing skills and performing more of their own songs. Also on the second disc covers the Beatles period after their first successful visit of the U.S. and the release of their first movie &#34;A Hard Days Night&#34;. All together both CDs cover the period for the Beatles from 1962 to 1965. In addition to the music throughout the recordings are brief snippets of the lads talking with the different BBC hosts of the radio shows The Beatles appeared on. It gives good examples of the wit and humor the Beatles would come to be known for and the charm they had. For the serious fan of the Fab Four I highly recommend this album. It is a must to include in your Beatles library.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|OMG is this a terrible movie. I really embarrass myself sometimes with the crap I talk myself into renting. Save your time and money on this one.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Too much  action  that didn't  contribute to the story; not enough real story.  It deviated poorly; too much from the original Superman.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This dictionary works great with my Kindle Fire HD and without me doing anything to install except &#34;deliver&#34; it to it. Hasn't missed a word and definitions are complete.
B003R50FRI|2.0|Over this book. Meaning for me it was over written, over descriptive, over philosophical, over long, over done and, if with suspension of belief, hard to really imagine that the continual major events could happen continuously in one persons life.<br />Plus side. Has been researched and several chapters entertaining but not enough to redeem .<br />It had the feel of trying to hard.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I watched every episode of every season as quickly as I could find time.  I thought about the characters at odd moments in between.  Reminded me of watching soaps 45 years ago.
B003KK6GOQ|4.0|Loved this story.  Recommended by a friend and,was delighted (friends last few recommendations had been a average).  It made me laugh, cry and really engaged me.
B00007M5CO|5.0|Discovered this group of musicians four years ago and love them.  Have seen them live and as good live as they are on their albums.
0307474259|5.0|It's a very informative book.  I belong to a group that has been battling being overweight for years, plus we're trying to eat healthy.  We chose this book and read a chapter a week.  We've reached the middle and the author has been slowly but clearly showing us the reason we get fat.  Like I said, it's very informative and fairly easy to understand.
1451666179|1.0|I have been following the blog Hyperbole and a Half for years now and genuinely enjoyed the blog, even enough to reread older posts. I was extremely excited to read this book but honestly it just fell flat. A lot of the comics were repeats, which I expected some, but not as many as were littered throughout the book. I didn't crack a smile once at her newer comics and her humor is really my sense of style.<br /><br />I was not entertained in the least and getting through the book felt like a chore. I regret my purchase and actually bought about ten copies to put in holiday baskets for my friends. I will be returning those copies, I don't feel like this book is up to their standards.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I really enjoyed revisiting these characters.  I had guessed the reason for the will by liked all the twists to get there.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|Characters are sooo clicheed, unbelievable and stupid that you cant enjoy the movie.  Olympus has fallen is 10 times better.  Emmerick should just stick to blowing things up.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved the Forgotten Garden. Kate Morton is a real page turner, not only it this book but in her others also.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|Great story and cast.  When the critics say it's bad it's must be good.  Entertaining film nothing like MIB.  I enjoyed it.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I am a Jew, and enjoy reading stories of the WWII era.  I'm glad I read it, as it will open up in theatres this next week and I will go see it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I don't think I have read a book so well written which has helped me understand history, entertained me, and inspired me to be a better person all at the same time.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Another series that works for us Anglophiles but may not appeal to those people looking for more action packed entertainment.
B005FPT51K|2.0|Stopped functioning after four months.  Warranty support is so so.  They will replace unit once I pay to ship it back to them.  They emailed me a blank form to fill out.  I would have preferred they pay for shipping and the company filling in at least a portion of the form as I had given them all my data.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Awesome Movie and one of my all time favorite Christmas chick flicks. Has a good story line and definitely worth watching over and over.
0425263924|1.0|Disappointed. I can't break it down, it would take the length of the book to describe all that was wrong with it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Challenging. Really gotta control yaself from spending money to get pass certain levels. I like it...except waiting 30 min for another life
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|great fun but some levels are way to hard<br />then other levels are super easy. should be more even in skill.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I really enjoyed the story.  It showed the power and depth of a disease.  It also showed the ony cure and the cost if getting there. Denzel Washington was wonderful.  He showed the pilots love of flying.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I would request this book to my sister.  I think this book is a good book because I like books that are about things that could really happen in real life.
B00AXVHHTI|5.0|Can hardly wait for season 4 to be released next year. This series is getting better and maintains it's high production standards, when you though it could not surpass the quality of the previous episodes. It is rare for me to watch any series over many seasons. Downton Abby is the exception. Superb acting, dialogue and scenery, wrapped in high quality production and musical score. Thank you to Amazon Prime for free streaming!
B00GH4R95C|4.0|This latest effort to bring Superman back to the big screen wasn't so bad, it could have been better, but I enjoyed it anyway. Well worth the time spent watching it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The absolute best period piece of masterpiece theatre UK.  Setting, dialogue, casting and storyline never leave me wanting. The production is fantastic. I can't get enough of this series. Thank you Amazon for free streaming for Prime members! I am highly pleased.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love the characters and the challenges. The game keeps my son very entertained.<br />It's a great game for adults and children alike.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It works for me. I like the features and it is pretty accurate. Never have any issues. Thanks for offering it for free.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A well-done documentary about one of the most inspiring human beings I have ever learned about. Why can't politicians and capitalists be like him? The world would be a much, much better place.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Classic romance - clever, fun, sweet, sassy.  Even though the movie is subtitled, it is not a distraction. Have watched it more than once.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Rockin' Star Trek. Some of the traditional byplay between the characters is a little forced. But it is a worthy addition to the canon.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is by far one of the best shows out there! i actually ordered this for one of my fathers Christmas present. It plays well without any damages. This DVD came before time expected which was a plus and with no damages to the package or the actual DVD. I recommend this to anyone who wants to give a great present or to a zombie lover.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|Ignore the professional critics. If you love the book, you will love this adaptation. It is emotional and evocative of the era, the characters, and the love story. DiCaprio and Maguire are excellent, and the sound track, while modern in places, perfectly captures the tone and spirit of the times. The rapping, for example, seems totally in place. I will be watching this film again for a long time.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|It's a good game except it's constantly stealing coins and hearts , it has stolen more than 30 million from me and now they want me to spend over 20 million for certain new underwater buildings, so that they can steal that too forget that the only way I would do that is if it stopped stealing.
0316074314|5.0|Among the many remarkable (as in \\"worthy of comment\\") achievements of Eleanor Catton's superb novel (some of which will be discussed below), one is particularly interesting:  in a long and complex narrative involving the lives and a few deaths of a large cast of characters (only three of whom are women), by far the most sympathetic and engaging characters are also in some senses the most remote, alien, \\"different\\" others--two men from China and one a Maori of New Zealand.  The rest of the characters are all Caucasian, of European background, mostly young.  To varying degrees, they are speakers of English (or its dialects), and only one, Benjamin Lowenthal, is Jewish--indeed, an observant Jew--while the others are at least from Christian backgrounds.<br /><br /> The two Chinese men, Quee Long and Sook Yongshen, have, one might say, washed up in northwestern New Zealand, the first a goldsmith and prospector, the second, proprietor of an opium den that caters to the needs of men and women most of whom work in the gold fields of that part of New Zealand, hoping for a strike that would allow them to pay their way home, wherever that might be.  Neither man speaks English well nor hears it with any great comprehension, though Sook (contemptuously called \\"Johnny Sook\\" by the European citizens of Hokitika, a town existing entirely to cater to the needs of the prospectors, \\"Johnny\\" being the term of convenience that white men use to address all the Chinese workers they encounter, not unlike the \\"Boy\\" used by white men with African slaves in the South) has a better sense of the language than Quee, and that is significant to the plot.<br /><br /> The Maori man, Te RauTauwhare addressed as Ted, is, of course, indigenous (\\"native\\") to the land these people inhabit, and their government has designated certain parts of the land as belonging to the Maori (in practical terms, only so long as it is convenient for the white men to leave it so), and the Maori are most definitely \\"different\\"--Tauwhare's extensive body and facial tattoos are a permanent and striking reminder to everyone who encounters him of the great differences between his cultural and religious background (very little understood by the whites) and their own.  Tauwhare pursues, so far as possible, the ways and customs of his ancestral people, but is treated with more respect by the white men, perhaps because of his more or less protected status, perhaps because he is dignified and formidable, perhaps just because the need of the whites to condescend to or oppress those they choose to perceive as their inferiors (and to exploit through indenture rules little less owned than slaves) is satisfied by their treatment of the Chinese men among them.<br /><br /> These three men, I would suggest, are the most sympathetic and emotionally appealing characters (to somewhat different degrees) in this novel, and that strikes me as a major achievement by its author.  Her descriptions of them, including passages in which they speak their native languages with little translation provided, and including detailed and vivid descriptions of their feelings and the distinctive ways they perceive the world around them--notably different from the ways the whites perceive that same world--offer the reader insights and expanded perceptions not available through the eyes or minds of the more familiar white European characters.  Tauwhare, in particular, because of the religious traditions of the Maori people, with their ancient and profound sense of identification with the natural world that sustains them and that they protect and preserve, worshiping its sacred character, provides a window onto the world we might not otherwise have access to.  (I make no judgment about the accuracy of Eleanor Catton's portrayal of the Maori or Chinese worldviews--I believe she has taken trouble to reconstruct them based on both information and sympathetic understanding, but accuracy is not relevant to the point I am making--that these characters are successfully \\"other\\" and provide a major part of the pleasure of reading this novel.)<br /><br /> None of this is meant to say that the white characters are all unpleasant or evil, nor that there are none whom we might like or even identify with.  The first character we meet in detail--Walter Moody, is on the whole a very sympathetic character--a decent man who finds himself more or less invited to become part of an inquiry--or one might say a conspiracy--to uncover the answers to several interlocking mysteries that have roiled the town of Hokitika, including a mysterious death, the disappearance of a prominent citizen, the possible suicide attempt of a recently arrived prostitute, the calamitous outcome of a much-promoted \\"seance,\\" all having occurred along with the wreck of a barque that had arrived in port the same day as many of these events occurred.<br /><br /> It will not do to offer any details about these complicated interactions--a disappeared trunk perhaps lost at sea, a frightening apparition on board a foundering ship, possible forged documents, and so forth.  For that is another great achievement of this novel--the creation of a richly intertwined series of events, gradually revealed through the activities of a number of different characters, each of whom is introduced to the reader in detail, with careful analyses of his or her personality and outlook, moral and philosophical views, and when appropriate, revelations about past behavior that affect the reader's view of the person and his or her likely future behavior.  There is the prosperous hotel owner and pimp, a second hotel manager, the proprietor of a pharmacy who deals in opium (not illegal), men involved in various aspects of shipping industry (very important to this mining town on the New Zealand coast), the editor/publisher of the local newspaper, a banker, a magistrate, a politician engaged in an election campaign, various gold prospectors, the Governor of the Hokitika Gaol (an institution that would incorporate the functions of almshouse and asylum), and the clergyman destined to be the Chaplain of that Gaol. among others.<br /><br /> Three women--Lydia Greenway/Wells/Carver (a woman of various identities), Anna Wetherell, a young prostitute and opium addict, and Margaret Shepard, wife of George Shepard, the Governor of the Hokitika Asylum and Jail, a woman perceived by most to be pathologically shy--perhaps agoraphobic, though the term is not used.  Each of these women is (as we learn over many pages) admirable in various ways, whether for intelligence and determination, sensitivity and emotional commitment, loyalty, perhaps even love for others.  Each is also complex and imperfect in important ways.  And it is fair to say that though they are all white, European, they are also, in this environment, entirely \\"other\\" and so comparable in some ways to the Chinese and Maori men.<br /><br /> One aspect of the novel that requires acknowledgment is the pervasive role of astrology as a point of reference.  As I am not familiar, except in the most superficial way, with the arcana of this traditional \\"science,\\" I have to say that the many \\"charts\\" and references to the influences affecting the various characters are mostly closed to me. Of course, one knows about the Zodiac and its signs, and the general beliefs of this ancient worldview are familiar in many contexts, especially literary, but the<br />finer points of the differences of influence are not familiar to me.  As it happens, each of the twelve major divisions of this novel is introduced with an astrological chart \\"locating\\" twelve of the major characters for the period during which the action takes place, and we know that several of the characters, most prominently Tauwhare, take seriously the influence of the stars, or at least are willing to exploit belief in those influences.  The author's introductory \\"Note to the Reader\\" offers the suggestion that stubborn adherence toa known error is characteristic of \\"persons born during the Age of Pisces, an age of mirrors, tenacity, instinct, twinship, and hidden things.\\"  That description of the qualities of the Piscean age would also make a very nice summary of the qualities of this narrative, all of which make it so fascinating.<br /><br /> It is right to call The Luminaries a thriller, and I would suggest it is a thriller of a traditional kind.  If it had been published in weekly chapters in a periodical, like the novels of Charles Dickens or Wilkie Collins or many others of the late 19th century, its way of proceeding and its regular approach to what we would call cliffhangers would perfectly suit it to that genre.  While many might invoke the memory of Dickens as comparison for this novel, I think its intricacy and rapid movement make it more akin to Wilkie Collins's best work, The Moonstone, perhaps, or Woman in White, though it also has affinities with late Dickens, Mystery of Edwin Drood, especially.  I also am inclined to speculate that we might anticipate a sequel.  While certain parts of the plot are \\"solved\\" and the problems resolved, there are several characters and situations notably left hanging, with uncertain outcomes, and those would more than supply material for a following novel, if the author chooses.<br /><br /> Long works of prose fiction (\\"big books,\\" or maxi-novels) such as this can provide many different kinds of pleasure.  In this case, the fascinating characters, the exotic setting, the constant twists and turns of the plot, the uncertain identities and surprising revelations, all contribute to a narrative that pleases by confounding the reader, who is compelled, indeed propelled to keep on reading, even at the risk of missing pertinent details.  I found myself checking back to earlier chapters, preceding bits of dialogue or description, time and again, to assure myself that I was not entirely lost or wrong about developments.  This was not a fault or a failure of the narrative--it was one of its genuine rewards.  While this novel has important things to say about human relationships, it is not profound; we do not keep reading in hopes of the depth of a Dostoevsky, the refinement of a Henry James, the historical sweep of a Tolstoy; we are rather entertained and moved, and we feel satisfied.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app for all devices especially when you want to keep on top of all your apps and make your device run smoother.  :).
0321714113|5.0|I think, this book is the best C++ language book amongst the recent C++ books such as C++ programming language, C++ Primer Plus and this.<br />Because this has plentiful samples of code snippets so that if you read only or majorly the codes, you can get great inspiration of the programming. You may get to realize how expert the authors are of writing C++ codes.<br /><br />Thanks.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I can not find any of the words I want to and too me,that is like the the worst book Ever and I am a straight A in English and I ace other dictionaries so eat that!
B00E3QJ7FG|4.0|I like that new version, the texture of the picture is good for a old movie. it is so interesting to replay this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Possibly the best book I have ever read. Just amazing and was very hard to stop reading. I could read this over and over. I also can't wait until the movie in June!
B00EUUJ2M8|3.0|this new version of Jumper 3D was so light in the 3D effect, I was expecting more, it is fine in the Blu-ray 3D players, except in the 3D laptop FUJITSU. The motion picture was so shaken.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is an amazing book. I loved every second of reading it! Can't wait to start on the next one!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is awesome but it needs redstone like in the computer and the Xbox. Please put redstone in the game!
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|Nice pedometer and heart rate measures. Sleep evaluation is cool but not sure how to influence my light/deep periods. Autosync when near my phone is great. Used with HealthMate app and Withings scale and BP cuff gives a well-rounded analysis of my daily health. Inadvertently placed in washing machine with no adverse impact (let dry for 3 days without touching any buttons).
B0035HKWM6|4.0|Bright, colorful, music, dancing, singing, silly, pretty Cameron Diaz - all this and a dog with giant balls. What's not to like.
B00B2166BS|3.0|Well, it charges my Nexus 10 about 20% faster than the usb cord, but really not that much faster that I can justify spending $25 on it.  Maybe I'm a little bit more patient than some, but really....you probably don't need this.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Nobody does it better than Denzel. Gripping story of human struggle. Love this movie, it sucks me in every single time.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I have been using the Logitech G13 for a bit over a month now. Primarily, I use it with Adobe Lightroom, though I've done a bit of gaming with it as well. I had been using a Razer Nostromo (virtually identical to the Belkin n52te) for about a year before that. For my use, the G13 has some pros and cons compared to the Nostromo.<br /><br />Pro:<br />= More buttons than the Nostromo, and a more \\"arbitrary\\" layout. That is, the Nostromo's key layout is to me very much like a section of a QWERTY keyboard was transplanted into it. The G13, with more keys of varying size and shape, makes it easier for me to remember the layout of the keyboard shortcuts and to arrange them the way I want.<br />= Automatic profile switching. This feature, coupled with the ability to automatically change backlight color with profile, let me instantly know that the correct profile is activated for my application. The Nostromo doesn't switch automatically and has only one backlight color.<br />= Display. If I am still unsure of the activated profile, I can check it on the G13's built-in display and lock it to a given profile, if I want to. With the Nostromo, you have to check the combination of 3 status lights and make sure you haven't accidentally switched profiles. The G13 display can also be used to show other information. I usually set mine to show CPU/RAM use.<br /><br />Con:<br />= The joystick. For me, the G13's flat joystick doesn't work as well as the Nostromo's angled D-pad. The Nostromo D-pad is not only angled vertically to match the rotational axis of the thumb, it is rotated so that the up-down selection axis lines up to the long axis of the thumb itself. The G13 joystick up-down axis is aligned with the long axis of the G13 itself. Maybe it's because I used the Nostromo for so long, but with the G13 I continually find myself triggering the \\"upper left\\" direction when I mean to trigger the \\"left\\" direction.<br />= Palm support. For me, the G13 doesn't have as nice a hand positionand palm support overall as the Nostromo does. I have very large hands, and I'm sure this varies a lot between people. I'm not in any discomfort as a result of using the G13, but the hand position does not feel as natural as it does on the Nostromo.<br /><br />So far, the pros of the G13 are definitely outweighing the cons for me. For the limited gaming I do, it's fine, and if I can get the joystick issue sorted out, I'll be very happy with the G13 as a productivity enhancer for Adobe Lightroom.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I don't think the story could have ended any other way. I was in tears during the epilogue. I am truly sad that it is all over.
B0035F0MTG|5.0|I had the extreme pleasure of attending Yuja Wang's concert at Duke University last month. She capped an unbelievable (if unplanned) double-header; the previous evening we heard Andras Schiff perform Bach's Goldberg Variations at arch rival UNC. Schiff was traditional, thoughtful, probing, generous. Wang was at least as impressive in a completely different way. She is a visual treat as well as an astounding pianist, helped by the wonderful acoustics of the just-remodeled Baldwin Auditorium. I was there--I saw her, heard her, and I still have a hard time believing what I heard. How can such a petite young lady get such a big sound, have such dynamic range, and sound at times like there must be more than two hands at work? I played the Petrushka from this disc to a fellow music lover and she swore there must be technical trickery at work.<br /><br />Miss Wang left the stage briefly between numbers, returning each time after about a minute. One might think the suspense of the evening would be if she could play all the notes in the knuckle-busters, but for my wife and me the suspense was if she could navigate the walk back and forth to the piano in those 5 inch heels. Like Schiff she was generous with the encores, although instead of a complete Beethoven sonata, we heard, among others, Art Tatum!<br /><br />I'll leave it to the experts to dissect the performances on this disc. All I know is that it is wonderful and tremendously exciting, helped immensely by our visual images of that evening. I've snapped up every one of her discs and eagerly await more.
B00G5AVM3S|4.0|Rather then having all of the add-ons this is everything and it is awesome. A high quality effects editor for a great price.
0671646788|5.0|Great self-improvement book.  Lots of good suggestions to keep you motivated and positive.  Purchased several copies over the years as gifts for children, other family members and friends who I care about.  Get it!  Highlight passage and re-read it from time to time.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Very Entertaining and can actually follow the Movie. Sets the Characters up for the Avengers, which I watched 1st and now understand.
B008JFUR10|4.0|I loved this movie, it made me feel like a child again, the only reason why i give it only 4 stars, it's because the bluray disc freezes in a action scene, already tried it on my PS3 and my bluray player, and the same thing, I'll try it on my PS4 as soon as it arrives, The DVD copy works fine.<br />I guess the bluray manufacturers should get higher standards and revision controls.<br /><br />CHEERS
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good card game, goes fast, and can do the next deal quickly when cards run out. I would recommend this game.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|The work of a teen.... I am reading fantasy books, but this really the work of a school teen...<br />Come on! A poor shepherd gets to the city and in 1 day is adopted by the royal family... and the princess in same day is in love with him... Should have known better not to accept free items..<br />Not worth the time spent to read it.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This show is totally awesome! The acting and  story lines makes this a success! I especially love the characters personality.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a book that anyone interested in stories of perseverance, military action and bravery &#34;above and beyond&#34; must read. The fact that the author slips in his own flavour and opinions provides a genuine experience that is lacking in so many ghost written books. The author is plain-spoken, honest and confident…this is what our Special Forces guys are like and should never have to apologise to anyone for being. In the retelling of his training the author could easily overstate his performance, but he does not. In the retelling of his missions and his to survive, he could portray himself as perfect, but again he does not. This honest evaluation shows an integrity that is one of the core values of the military, but frequently gets lost in translation.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I've read the book, and this really has nothing to do with it. So if you can set aside that and just watch it like its a regular action packed zombie movie it's pretty good. It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00F1CRSKM|5.0|Arcade fire....Barely on my radar before...but this album changes that for sure. Deff a new direction for them. One thing they have proved is that they are staying relevant in a major way. I'm a HUGE fan of James Murphy and had no idea that he produced this album when I first heard, it and fell in love with, it.    I was actually riding in the back of a van when someone riding with us from Europe sitting up front put this on the car stereo. I though it was some euro electro-pop band that I'd never heard of before. I had to Shazam it twice just to make sure my app wasn't mistaken. Who would of guessed Arcade Fire could sound this good and different from their usual hipstery rock sound (which wasn't bad IMO...just not always my cup of tea).    Don't get me wrong...Arcade Fire is deff still there under it all. It's just now they have a really badass club, dance your face off, can't stop moving to it beat, pick me up sound. It's sound that got me hooked on LCD Soundsystem, Juan McLean, & S*** Robot. Kodos to James Murphy for reinventing the whee,l and Arcade Fire for being the vehicle to which that wheel is moving. I hope the good tunes keep on rolling.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is awsome. Get it its awsome sharks fish and more. It's so addicting I love this game I bet your love it.
B00F30S0Y0|2.0|I've liked Arcade Fire since Funeral. This release is difficult to describe. One thing to note is that it has a large electronic component, so much so that it does not sound like the same band to me. Being electronic isn't not necessarily a bad thing, but as a potential buyer, you should be aware that it is a significant departure from their previous work. I actually applaud bands for pushing their boundaries. There are some interesting moments here, but as a whole, I'm having a hard time following this one. That being said, some of the albums I disliked at first eventually became some of my favorites. Music that is very different from what you're used to, if it's really good, can end up changing you. To me, that is the sign of a really powerful work. I will keep listening and if it grows on me, I'll update the review accordingly. I will say that it is a little better than I thought the first few times I listened to it. But this one is work.
B000W8HC8I|2.0|Interesting story but poorly written.  When he talks of business topics it seems more credible but he goes into details on off topic subjects that are unnecessary and likely hyperbolic.  Warning: lots of sex and drug references that are graphic on nature (and frankly detract from the story because of the graphic nature).
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I didn't like this one nearly much as the first two in the series, but it still makes for fun reading
B005PK56TA|5.0|Simply put, it is able to captivate the viewer from the start and delivers great performances that makes the thrills even more intense.
B007G5H2HQ|4.0|A fun twist on the Shrek story.  My kids loved it.  I actually fell asleep while watching it [twice actually] but my kids kept waking me with belly laughter.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very well researched without being dry.  Mr Aslan states what many historians have already put forward but in an approachable and highly readable manner.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|How can you not love smashing buildings and pigs with birds.  Everyone loves this game.  But man I wish Amazon didn't require more words to give something a rating.  This is getting old!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Very good season, better than the first.  The writing and acting are so good you don't want an episode to end.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Different but fun the same.  Her voice is not typical of a singing sensation, but it is a good type of different.  I like to break up the  Christmas music monotony by adding a little &#34;seasoning&#34; with soundtracks like this.
0307352153|5.0|This is a great book.  Very helpful in understanding the quiet in myself and in my children.  I have a better understanding of how to make the most of the introvert side of myself and others.  Highly recommended.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I love that the writers found a way to continue to give us the story of the lives of these characters in their universe.  Star Trek should last forever!  After watching Fringe, I am so happy that JJ Abrams is working on this iconic series...wish Fringe would return like Star Trek!
B00139XSBA|4.0|Great storytelling. Beautifully written narrative. Wolfe does a great job framing up such an exciting time in history. Got me really interested in space and fighter planes.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The poetry.  The imagery.  Amazing story - one that those crazy, crap-for-brains neo-Nazis should be forced to read.  You know the ones:  they deny the Holocaust ever happened.  Actually, this book should be on every high school reading list so that war on any scale, but especially the scale of WWII, can never happen again.  I cannot wait to see the movie!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I admit it took me a while to get going on this novel. Once I started, I found it amazing on many levels! Landay did a nice job of foreshadowing, but not spoiling the end. The Barber family is a believable All-American family. I could feel their pain, joy, and love! I kept trying to predict the possible ending, and yet ended up surprised!
1616551607|5.0|This is probably the most beautiful book I've ever seen, and as a pretty intense Final Fantasy fan I highly recommend it to anyone from the biggest fan (like myself) to the newest of newcomers to the world of Final Fantasy. The book is featured prominently on my bookcase and I show it off to all of my friends whenever they come by. They're astounded at the book, as well as for the price I managed to get it for thanks to Amazon. ^-^ 10/5 any day of the year.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone said it was so addicting... I tried it out and i was like what's the big deal? I kept playing and now i can't stop. It's so fun.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game.  I would give it 5 stars if there were more/better instructions for the harder and very different levels.  Like the chocolate I had no idea what that was or how to play it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I lllllooooovvvvveeeee this game!Now I don't have to play on my friends apps.It is really fun to play with your friends.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|3 stars from a grown man who's already studied prehistory. Yeah. This movie was entertaining, got me through an enjoyable 1.5 hours. Had all the Holywood shtics. Problem, solution, etc. Love at the end. Yeah-super family. What's up with Mr. Cage? I saw his pyramid cemetery plot down in the city of New Orleans on a walking tour. They said he was in trouble for tax evasion---with all his preaching.
0525478817|5.0|To think that I was not going to read this book due to all the hype and it being a YA book.  Well am I glad that I did decide to purchase this book.  It took me a few weeks to actually read it, and when I did, I could not put it down.  I finished this little tear jerker in a day, it was just that powerful and slightly emotional of a book.  If you like a main character that is struggling to find something in life then I guaranty that this is the book for you, no matter what age you are, it'll bring you to tears.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Was resistant to watch this as McConaughey is soo up on himself. I get a little tired of the southern draw shtick. But hot bod, over-confident Matt is always good at selecting his scripts. (Loved &#34;Paperboy&#34;.) McConaughey keeps us mesmerized. I was hoping I wouldn't like this movie so I could give him a bad write-up. (No can do.)
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Awesome app.  Free ? Are you kidding me?  Fun for all ages. One of the best and most original apps I have seen.
B000HL09MG|5.0|This movie really scares me. I believe it can be real. Conspiracy theory stuff. This movie has secret &#34;weight&#34; to it.
0316055433|5.0|Simply extraordinary.  I am not much of a fiction reader - and I couldn't put it down.  I wouldn't be surprised to see her as Pulitzer finalist -- if not the winner.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|An amazing book by an amazing author.  The hardcover is a work of art. The story and writing are fantastic.
075640407X|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is a brilliant writer. His books are so eloquent it's like I'm reading poetry. I highly recommend this series.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|So much fun playing this game. I love all play first games. I can't wait for more games like this one to become available.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive.  I hate the levels that you get stuck on and have to wait on someone to help you. That's stupid.  But other than that it's a great way to veg out and it helps me fall asleep at night too.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Not the way I would have ended the trilogy, but a very good book nonetheless.  Enjoyed the trilogy very much.
B006LUCV4Q|5.0|LOVE her voice, music<br />Love the haunting melodies, the mellow flow of her music. Refreshing in a dream like way.
B00CO5AQ12|1.0|It does not behave as shown in video.  The sand will stick to your hands.  Just go to the beach and pick up some sand.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|I really tried to figure out where this book was going and read it to the end. But it left me feeling like I had wasted my time. I cannot recommend other than to say that Elizabeth Gilbert has great style but the story was greatly lacking.
B000002LEU|5.0|I got into Joy Division's music after seeing the biopic, Control, as well as 24 Hour Party People (both movies are very entertaining). I really enjoy the darker sound (such as Dead Souls). One can only wonder what could have been if Ian Curtis was still here.
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|Must read if you want to make a real change. It's a fast read and inspires you to start making changes immediately.
B007H9B6KA|5.0|I have been a fan since the 90's and very glad they are back. The sound is still the same, which is not a bad thing, it takes me back to some very good days.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it is ok jk i love it so much but my mom wont let me have the book hunger games and seen the firs movie its sooo good not wonderfull
B004V6MWFU|5.0|A very soothing, pleasant album. Definitely different than his work with Pearl Jam.  I also recommend the Oscar winning soundtrack for Into the Wild.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|Very Interesting!  the story moves quickly and keeps the viewer interested.<br />Lots of different story lines - can't wait to watch season 2
B00EZPCZ5O|4.0|I know their sound has changed a bit from when they first came on scene, but I do enjoy what AFI has evolved into. I also know this album has been given lower ratings than their previous works (Rolling Stone gave them (2 or) 3 stars and a pretty rough critique). This album is still worth purchasing. If you want a slightly different sound, I recommend the 2 albums by Blaqk Audio (consists of 2 members of AFI). I also really enjoy their sound.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I thinck it is Asimov cool grafecs days of fun no gliches so far it seams like the levals  never India it gos on and on and on
B002TLSSXO|4.0|Only wee complaint is the ladle tips because of the extra weight of it's size. Hence the 4 stars, not 5. Bought a set as a gift as we'll.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Extremely well written, it's like reading a novel.<br />The only thing I would have prefered are footnotes, instead of a full bibliography at the end.
B004GYY714|5.0|Extraordinary choice of radio stations through out the world, in various language, archived radio shows, absolutely amazing! One of the most enjoyable and useful apps on my Kindle!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|very fun. just like the game mario. same concept and levels are similiar to it.  I give it four stars!
1616550414|5.0|I loved this book, it's just perfect for a Leyend of Zelda fan. Everything inside is pure magic!<br />I spent hours reading and exploring its pages.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Cause i liked those movies and i loved them i want amazon put more movies that i can rent. Most of your good movies are for sale and not for rent. I like watching movies online and i liked amazon but why some of your movies are only for sale and not for rent?
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved the book. Nice flow, multiple surprises, some romance, more intrigue.  The ending was a bit disappointing in that it wrapped up the loose ends a bit too quickly, but I would highly recommend it!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I loved this book, excellent told story, loving each encounter with the couple, and their friends. I want my own Vampire Highlander yummmmmmmmm
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I am loving to watch on this best movie of Cirque Du Soleil to be improved. I wanted to give this DVD to my mother for Christmas.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this app it is the most addictive app I have played all day  I don't know what else to right
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am enjoying to play and figure out on this game while I am resting after my working. Great puzzles.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I love all the mini games! They are fun and enjoyable! You should like them too! The only thing that is bad is that you have too wait for points to buy things. But still a great game
B0053F042G|5.0|I liked this movie a lot.  I started watching in on my DVR at home and then it stopped working, but I only had half an hour left so I wanted to see the ending.  the movie is a bit repetitive, but if that does not bother you, I think it has a good plot.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|The game is fun itself but it said it would give me 100 coins and it didn't give me a single coin
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|I don't want to spoil it but I am done watching this show.  We loved the first two seasons and most of this one but I am no longer interested in it.  One selfish actor's actions have ruined his this show.  I feel bad for the producers of this show because I think a lot of people won't be watching anymore.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Cool game it so  tobygames plays it  cool I love it I play it until my battery dies I play this more than my other games
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Lot of twists and turns.  Very hard to put down.  I'll be buying the rest of the series very soon
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This was a great movie. Putting all childhood beliefs together fighting off evil was fantastic. And dealing with the question &#34;What is my purpose?
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I really enjoyed &#34;The Selection:&#34;  frothy but fun.  &#34;The Elite&#34; disappointed me, however, mainly because the characters all seemed to get less mature and make really stupid (and sometimes deadly) decisions.  I needed more character growth and less character regression.  I also got tired of America spending the whole book like, &#34;Oh, poor me, I have to choose between two perfect men!&#34;  I don't want to go into all the things I considered to be immature decisions, because that would spoil the book, but here are a few hints:  her final use of Gregory's diary, making out right after certain other traumatic events, and (okay, so this is little, but...) falling asleep in the woods when the rebels might still be loose.  Also, I have to wonder about all these rebel attacks.  Either palace security is completely inept, or they've got traitors in their midst.  Either way, THAT is what the characters should be worrying about.  Not these other things.<br /><br />Despite all these plot and character issues, it still kept me hooked, and one of the marks of a good book is that people get passionate about what the characters should or shouldn't do.
B00A2H9P98|4.0|great flick, I liked it, I liked it, but I liked Olympus has fallen more, it kind of made you wonder about being A tourist
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Loved it!  The first pages absolutely hooked me.  Great premise, great characters (okay, so Alex might be too perfect, but oh well).  Smooth, powerful writing.  Great tension, fear, delirious love, politics, scary possible future, tough ethical issues.  The ending is heart-thumping good.  Oliver adeptly wove her themes and symbols throughout the book to create a cohesive whole.  Extremely engaging.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|SUPERB, SUPERB, I loved this movie, like The amazing Spider man, I liked this so much that I hope there will be another one
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it. Fun on the kindle and works great. No problems at all. Works flawlessly. Even the grand kids like it. A good free app.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Beautiful application! Runs smoothly and the graphics are just as good as a computer. Really satisfied, not to mention its free!!
B007EC27QM|5.0|I bought this app before Amazon Kindle included its own calculator app with their tablets and find it superior, easier to use and accurate, more so than their own (which you cannot remove)<br />This is my calculator!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a the BEST-SELLING GAME IF You DON'T BELIEVE IT GO ONLINE<br />MY PARENTS Were ADDICTED To  this Game TRY THE DEMO It AWSOME
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game! Couldn't put it down. I just wished there was some hints or tips for when I got stuck. I had to look some up online to solve. Lol
0071831592|4.0|This book gives you some tips and ideas for making your next presentation engaging, unique and something your audience wont easily forget.
B001F7MSFW|4.0|well this actor (hellboy) does a good job of creating the great actors of before  like in the 50's and 60's and its got a lot of special effects and interesting weird  life forms . it is worth it to buy .
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|It's working  so good ... I like that and its really works d hell ya .. damn it is working ! Yes yes yes yes yes yes
1579128149|5.0|This book brings life to the subject so the information is easily retained. The pictures are amazing. All 3 of my children (ages 11-17) love this book.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love Real steel is awesome i have zeus,atom,twin cities,midas,noisy boy,gridlock and i want to get blacjac this is my own Real steel is awesome.....................................................
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is not my usual type of books.  The 4 book set was already on my Kindle when I bought it.  I thought I'd try it.  Loved it! Had to purchase #5 and am anxious for #6 to come out.  I don't want to have to wait to finish the series.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Her story is incredible and she tells it in a way that enables the reader to see into the daily life of families in Swat, Pakistan.  I enjoyed the chronology of events in Swat including the gradual rise of the Taliban and citizens increasing fear of them.  Her version of events validates what I have heard/read in US media reports especially the absolute and cruel methods the Taliban uses.  If you don't know Malala's story you may find the book unbelievable, if you do know her story this book will give you insight into the living conditions there.  Just as interesting to me is the glimpse she provides the reader into the trusting nature of the Pakistanis that &#34;all will be better eventually&#34; even as friends and relatives are murdered, schools are destroyed, businesses closed, etc.  Malala is nothing short of a miracle, both physically and spiritually.  You will love her story.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It is kind of like angry birds. It is a basic game but its simplicity makes fun. I would say it's worth the two dollars.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I enjoyed this book and learned much from reading it.  I was prepared for lots of controversy but found little.  The author uses historical fact throughout and draws comparisons to the secular reporting versus Biblical accounts which are supporting of some of the book's claims.  He also points out conflicting accounts of the same event when told by different writers of the Bible and gives hypotheses of how/why this may have happened.  I recommend this book to all who are curious about the historical time when Jesus walked the earth.  I was struck by the cruelty of man towards other men, of the complete oppression of women, and the heartless slaughter of animals otherwise known as sacrificial gifts.  Although I knew crucifixion was common in that era I had no idea of the frequency of its use and the flimsy evidence required for such a sentence.  To learn that the hillsides were full of crosses on any given day was startling to me.  So without giving away anymore, I will close by saying Zealot appears to be a well researched and enlightening book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love Hate this game. I wish there was more instructions for some of the levels. Although it is frustrating, it is very hard to put down!
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This book is so well written, really great character development and keeps your interest through out.  Really captured the personality of someone with Asperger's Syndrome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush crushes the competitors in this field.  It is competitive, challenging and it is great fun (except when you cant figure out how to win your current game) . Then it is exasperating!  Enjoy.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I made the mistake of thinking this was going to stream everything from my iPad to my TV.  I was hoping, for example, that I would be able to stream HBOGo.  So far it has not been useful at all.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Loved it! My new favorite superhero movie of all time with the character that started it all. Henry Cavill was phenomenal as Superman and I loved what they did with Jor El and Russell Crowe's performance was great as usual! No corny stuff, real kick butt and interesting Superman. Bring on more!
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Clever. Tom Cruise put in a good performance.  The plot is tight and the acting is good.  Happy to have purchased the disc.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|11/29/2014 An app update caused the volume to reduce so now the app is unusable. Support says an update to fix this is coming but no date when that will be released - save your money. I will update back to five stars when and if it gets fixed    Since purchasing this app I am sleeping much better. I use river and waterfall together which masks my upstairs neighbor's noise.
B000HF6XV8|4.0|The story is great but the quality of the picture was not good at all! It is one of my favorite movies.
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Love it!  This is my sceond copy, actually.  Wore the first one out. A must have for fans.  Love SRV !
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|My four year old great grandson loves this app.  It doesn't get boring for him as it does different things.  I would recommend this as a good learning tool about choices.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it! It's so much better than Temple Run. Buy it! I especially love the caves with train tracks and the ropes. It is one of the best games I have ever played! You should so buy it!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A wonderful book; pulls at the imagination. Great edition plus the occasional photo's throughout that better express the story are really good.
B00005V1WO|5.0|I've not watched this film in many years so I thought I'd give it another watch to see if it stands up and I'm pleased to say that it does. It's an unusual horror film that says more about the imagination and its ability to conjure terror, especially when helped by copious indulgence in opiates!<br /><br />The film tells the story of a night hosted by Lord Byron when he is visited by his friend the poet Shelley and his mistress (later to become Mary Shelley), from this party two classics of the horror genre are spawned Polidori's 'The Vampire' and Shelley's 'Frankenstein'. The party starts with a sceance to create a ghost built from all of their personal fears. Their creation then haunts them through a horror filled night.<br /><br />The characters are a joy to watch and are a mixed bunch, I always enjoy watching Gabriel Byrne in action and his ability to play dark characters works well with his portrayal of Lord Byron. The other charcters are fun as well, especially Shelley (although he does come across as a little overdramatic at times, but that does fit with the story and the role) and the Doctor is excellent as the weak link in the group.<br /><br />The two female characters are less impressive, but still do their jobs well. The horror in the film touches on the metaphysical as well as the psychological and even better does not rely on gore or shock to get the message across. There's a definite sense of dread as the film gets going.<br /><br />The one reall off note for me was the music, for some of the scenes (such as the barn) it's a little unimaginitive and seems at odds with style of the film. Still that's not a major issue and overall this is an excellent horror film.
159184617X|2.0|Ive would be better served making a series of documentaries on the design of each of the iconic Apple products. He could discuss the stages of design and how these are then turned into products. Especially interesting would be the design of tooling which he mentioned in one of the youtube videos.<br /><br />Jobs biography was an interesting read mainly because of what/who he was and how he thought.<br /><br />An Ive book should concentrate mainly on the details of the designs. In fact I would buy a coffee table book that covered all areas of the design of say, the macbook.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Intelligent, fast-paced, cool futuristic plot, tragic, amazing CG effects- fantastic cast (big names-big talent) , and Henry Cavill shirtless...  Nuff said ;)
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|My son really loves this game. He likes robots and loved the movie Real Steel - so this is the perfect little game for him.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This will be a Xmas gift for my husband, who has just started watching the series.  This will be great to catch him up on previous seasons.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Cute game but a little repetitive. My kids like it though - so that's why I am giving it five stars. I guess some games really focus on the kids. HA!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad this finally came out for the Kindle Fire. All my friends were playing it and raving how much fun it was. I'm totally addicted now.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I'm not going to go over this album song-by-song.  &#34;Soldiers&#34; is my favorite Stryper album and I haven't enjoyed one of their albums as much as this one since &#34;To Hell...&#34;.  Michael sounds great and the band is tight.  A really nice surprise to hear the boys hit one out of the park at this stage in their career.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I agree completely with the general consensus:  Great game!  I played on a second generation Kindle Fire, in the middle level of difficulty.  I only had a few minor issues.  One inventory item (the mug) was very balky and it took me a lot of tries to get it where it needed to go, to the point that I almost thought I was on the wrong track and gave up.  There were one or two other items that took a couple of tries to get them where they needed to be, but not to that extent.  The inventory was easy to figure out, and there were labels if you swiped across them.<br /><br />There were hidden object scenes, but not many.  Near the beginning of the game i encountered a cluster of them, but later on there didn't seem to be as many.  A few of them were harder than others, but in all cases the objects were available to be picked up right from the start, with no twists.  I don't like hidden objects, but these were less objectionable than most.<br /><br />The puzzles varied.  Some I liked, some I didn't.  A few were tedious enough that I lost interest and skipped them.  There was an instruction button that helped you to figure out what to do, if you needed it.<br /><br />The built-in hint feature was generally helpful.  The game was easy to navigate and while there was some backtracking, mostly you stayed in one general area at a time.  You did revisit previously covered areas, but it wasn't hard to decide when to do so.<br /><br />I'd like to see  more games like this one - maybe with even fewer (or no) hidden object scenes.  PS - If you are choosing whether to buy this or to buy Haunted Escape - Wrath of Victoria --- Buy this one!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Good but much  like his other books.  He seems to write about the same subject l guess it is just his style I  would have liked to have known if Jake and his family got there new home, not one of my favorites it was like he just got tired and ended the book
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|A masterpiece<br />Richard Flanagan has written beautifully before but this novel is surely destined tk rank with the very best Australian literature has to offer
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Again, can't wait to see the next season and the only sad part is, I'll have to wait longer to see season 4.  I've never watched a series, but after two friends said how good it was, I decided to watch Season 1 and now I'm hooked.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|Boring, boring, boring.  The story never gets going and I gave up after about 50 pages.  Choose this one if you have trouble sleeping at night.  Guaranteed to put you to sleep.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|But not the smoothest read. This book could have benefited from good editing. That being said, Mr Thiede has written an entertaining mystery.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  This is a true role model.  This is a man who we can all learn from.  This is about making a true impact, not just making an impression.  This is an inspiring and beautiful life story which makes me want to be a better person.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My favorite of the trilogy! Very engaging, filled with twists and turns that keep the pages turning! It's easy to read over and over.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|To the loyal Divergent fans: make your own ending. Avoid spoilers. This book is fine (not great, but fine) until the last bit. The ending is unfulfilling - it's not what you want to happen, but it's not written in a way that tugs at your emotions at all. It's unsatisfying and frustrating (and not in a good way).
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|my two favorote things in one I just wish they came.out with M<br />mario angry birds that will be awesome
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The interaction between this talented ensemble is fascinating and entertaining.  You never know what Harvey is going to do.  The smariness of Louis is just right...not to overdone...
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|this game is massing up my kindle! facebook is not working right, when i open the it said internal service failure now its unplayabie! this game needs a big update!
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Loved the book...loved the stories...loved the photographs! It's an amazing book that says as much of the subjects in the photographs as it does of the person behind the camera...trully unique, brave and inspiring!
B00000IZOR|1.0|My 1-1/2 y/o just hasn't seemed the least bit interested in playing with this toy from the first day she received it until now. I guess with all the push button phones and cell phones nowadays, she can't relate to the old rotary phones. (??)
B005K17RU0|2.0|I think I would like this IF I could figure out how to change the location. I added one when I was on vacation and can't change back. I can't see where to make one location the default either. I'm considering deleting and reinstalling where I'd have only one location.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Poorly written, porly developed plot.  I actually got tired of reading about them having sex, and I've been deployed to Afghanistan for the last 8 months.  I figured if all the women in America were going nuts over this book maybe it would be worth the read (know your enemy, lol) but it's just cheap smutt.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|PROS:<br /><br />+ Only takes 3 hours to charge, as opposed to Sony's 6 hours<br />+ A great low-cost alternative to the Sony PS3 headset<br />+ Clear sound receiving and sending<br />+ Comfortable fit, adjustable  ear hook and microphone placement<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- It's only fitted for the right ear<br />- You have to use the charge cable with this product, PS3 cords won't work<br />- Mute does not show on the PlayStation 3 screen<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Gioteck seems to have done their homework and improved on their previous EX-01 and EX-02 headsets. When I game online, I want to make sure that other players can hear me, I can hear them, and I can mute without too much hassle. The EX-03 meets each of my requirements.<br /><br />FIRST IMPRESSIONS:<br /><br />I was irritated by the small font in the instruction book, but that's a minor gripe.<br /><br />Pairing was a little cumbersome, I had to scan my headset to register it as a Bluetooth device, whereas my Sony PS3 headset was recognized by connecting it with a USB cable.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />I was happy to see it only took 3 hours to get a full charge on the EX-03 headset, my old Sony PS3 headset took 6 hours to fully charge.<br /><br />There were 3 earbuds included, and I used the smallest one. The earbud focused the sound inside my ear and was very soft, which was a vast improvement over my Sony PS3 earpiece.<br /><br />When I played Little Big Planet 1 and 2 and Splinter Cell: Blacklist, all the other players could hear me without any problems, and I could hear them loud and clear.<br /><br />The ear hook and microphone extension were easy to adjust to my comfort level, and even after a 2 hour stretch of gaming, this headset didn't cut into my ear or feel heavy with prolonged use. The volume up and down buttons were easy to use.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />The Gioteck EX-03 headset is only fitted for the right ear, so the lefties are out of luckon this one. It even says in the instruction manual \\"Unfortunately this is not possible.\\" Truth be told, I rarely use my left ear for headset usage, but The Sony PS3 headset gave me the option to switch if I wanted to.<br /><br />Don't throw away the box thinking you can use your Sony cables to charge this headset - you have to use the charging cable that comes with it, nothing else works.<br /><br />When I put my headset on mute, there wasn't any visual indication on my PS3 screen (which does show up for the Sony PS3 headset) - instead, I would hear two descending tones about 4 seconds apart. If I wanted to turn my mic back on, I had to press the power button and I'd hear two ascending tones to indicate it was back on.<br /><br />MY VERDICT:<br /><br />On the whole, this is a very crisp and clear headset and does exactly what I want...allows me to hear and be heard without any discomfort. If that's what you want from a gaming headset (and you don't want to spend the extra $ for a Sony PS3 headset), then this one will get the job done.<br /><br />Recommended.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Reading it was a very different experience than I expected, but very interesting. The book, to me, is less about the author's journey from journalist to memory champion, and less about learning specific memory techniques, than it is about thinking deeply, both scientifically and philosophically about human memory, education, intelligence, society, and history. Resist the urge to go to the end, but all the questions I had were answered in the last few pages of the book, and all the questions I didn't know I had were answered in the rest of it.

B0006AAS5G|5.0|This my 4th consecutive year of using this watch. I use this daily. I even sleep, exercise, take bath and do everything with this watch on. After 4 years of use I replaced batteries once. Time is quite accurate. I just had to adjust it for 3 min after a use of 4 years. The chrome is still good however it’s not like new anymore. I think it requires a gentle buffing from the machine. The buttons are all working good. No hint of rusting at all. The glass has little scratches on though. But as I mentioned I use it rough so it is expected. I bought it in 2010 for $80 in a wonderful packing. This resembles a lot with Rolex Daytona with costs around $14000. This is the best Invicta model I have seen so far and perhaps the most popular too. I will definitely now try their other model 9212 which has golden mix. I fully recommend this watch.
B002SSBD6W|2.0|“Eating Animals” is Jonathan Safran Foer’s entry into the crowded non-fiction food book market. To start, Foer explains the motivation for writing his book: the birth of his son, and the desire to explore and understand what his son should eat. He notes this story is not an appeal to vegetarianism, but a self-directed journey learning about meat. This family-focus is coupled with a portrait of Foer’s grandmother: a Holocaust survivor who promoted drinking pop and eating animals. He finishes the introduction noting, “While this book is the product of an enormous amount of research, and is as objective as any work of journalism can be – I used the most conservative statistics available… -- I think of it as a story. There’s plenty of data to be found, but it is often thin and malleable.” (Loc 200).    Let’s dig in.  The first chapter is captivating. I enjoyed the family aspect of the story; in browsing other food books, “The Botany of Desire” and parts of other Michael Pollan, authors omit the crucial role of family and family food culture in shaping an individual’s diet. In addition, Foer’s reason for becoming vegetarian eloquently explained my rationale, though I have a hard time formulating or admitting it:  “In high school I became vegetarian more times than I can now remember, most often as an effort to claim some identity in a world of people whose identities seemed to come effortlessly.” (Loc 94).  Foer is a creative writer, and showcases his skills early, leaning on alliteration and parallel construction. About his grandmother, “And so she never cared if I colored outside the lines, as long as I cut coupons along the dashes.” (Loc 33) Noting animals in media he writes, “Children’s books are constellated with rabbits and mice and bears and caterpillars, not to mention spiders, crickets, and alligators.” (Loc 270).  The ensuing thought exercise about eating dogs exhibits a perfect stand-alone polemic essay. I found myselfrepeating this exercise to friends and family: why don’t we eat dogs? Why do we spend money to keep dogs as pets? Moreover, the writing here is powerful, strong, and the authenticity of arguments for eating dogs relentless. In the book’s most memorable paragraph, Foer writes about his family dog, George:  “She… backs her flatulent ass into the least interested person in the room, digs up the freshly planted, scratches the newly bought, licks the about-to-be-served, and occasionally exacts revenge (for what?) by s***ting in the house.” (Loc 289).    Let’s continue digging in (spoilers ahead).  After the dog polemic, the story moves downhill. Next is an odd “dictionary” (Words / Meaning), which blends sarcastic definitions with serious, ironic anecdotes with historical statistics. Non-fiction books benefit from having a strong appendix or glossary, but this one feels like a flimsy rhetorical device to provide credibility. There is little consistency, and certain words seem irrelevant or superfluous.  “Desperation” recounts a funny anecdote about Foer’s grandmother buying flour, but the word appears only once in the remaining text (and the word used is “desperate”).  The entry for “Species Barrier” is two pages about Knut, a polar bear born at the Berlin zoo, and ends (pithily? humorously? sarcastically?) with: “This is the species barrier.” (Loc 1022).  The definition for “suffering” is particularly confusing. The end: “What is suffering? I’m not sure what it is, but I know that suffering is the name we give to the origin of all the sighs, screams, and groans – small and large, crude and multifaceted – that concern us. The word defines our gaze even more than what we are looking at.” (Loc 1045). Rather than attempt to give a moral or philosophical working definition of suffering, Foer says he doesn’t know what it means, and resorts to using wordy, overwrought emotional appeals.    The next chapter, titled “Hiding /Seeking” again utilizes confusing formatting. Each section in the chapter starts “I’m ...” The first is written by Foer, called “I’m Not the Kind of Person Who Finds Himself on a Stranger’s Farm in the Middle of the Night,” and it documents his excursion onto a turkey factory farm at night, with “C”, an animal activist guide.  During this section, it’s difficult to locate Foer’s role as writer and author. He says: “ – but what the hell have I gotten myself into? I am not a journalist, activist, veterinarian, lawyer, or philosopher – as, to my knowledge, have been the others who have made such a trip.” (Loc 1088). Yes, he’s just the lowly millionaire author of two New York Times Bestsellers, both with film adaptations. This comment starts the barrage of self-centered writing, and doesn’t fit with his statement that the book is “as objective as any work of journalism can be.”  Next, we hear from “C.” This section is called “I Am the Kind of Person Who Finds Herself on a Stranger’s Farm in the Middle of the Night.” The origin of the text is never explained: is it a letter or email correspondence, written by “C”? Is it Foer interviewing her? Is it Foer completely fictionalizing her life? Is it Foer piecing together bits of interviews and emails to create succinct, clear paragraphs written in “C’s” voice? The text is written in italics, while normal interviews are traditionally quoted elsewhere in the book. The next section, “I Am a Factory Farmer,” is similar. This style is later referenced as “the voice,” and is explained in the Notes section as: “This monologue is derived from the statements of more than one factory farmer interviewed for this book.” (Loc 2956, 4121).    The next chapter, “Influence / Speechlessness” starts of with a graphic symbol used too frequently by Foer. There are five pages of the words “Influence / Speechlessness” and nothing else. The reader gets to the end and learns: “On average, Americans eat the equivalent of 21,000 entire animals in a lifetime—one animal for every letter on the last five pages.” (Loc 1598).  Huh? It’s an interesting statistic – 21,000 animals eaten in a lifetime. But what’s the point of putting just that many letters on the last 5 pages? Again, it seems like a gimmick, a superficial trick to fill fast pages and keep the reader engaged.    The next chapter is called “Slices of Paradise/Pieces of S***.” The first half of the chapter paints a rosy, glowing picture of Paradise Locker Meats, in northwestern Missouri, and its owner Mario Fantasma. There’s description about the raising, killing, and shipping of pigs. The business is “…one of the last bastions of independent slaughtering in the Midwest and is a godsend for the local farming community.” (Loc 2011). There's another glossy, romantic picture of a farm, this time Paul Willis’s hog farm in Thortonville, Iowa. Mr. Willis reminisces about the olden days of farming, and being raised in the same house he lives in today.  The next section is fairly predictable: “Pieces of S***.” Here we go back into the factory farm for at least the third time in the book, with a focus this time on animal feces. We see more of Foer’s silly comparisons, coming this time in rapid fire.     On a fine levied on Smithfield, a large pork producer: “… but this is a pathetically small amount to a company that now grosses $12.6 million every ten hours.” (Loc 2386).   On Smithfield’s production: “Today, Smithfield is so large that is slaughters one of every four pigs sold commercially in the nation.” (Loc 2396).   On the contamination of a river from farm feces: “…thirteen million fish were literally poisoned by s*** – if set head to tail fin, these victims would stretch the length of the entire Pacific coast from Seattle to the Mexican border.” (Loc 2396-2406).   On the former Smithfield CEO’s worth and name: “Joseph Luter III’s stock in Smithfield was recently valued at $138 million. His last name is pronounced “looter.”” (Loc 2426)    Now we’re back to the central discussion on eating meat. Get ready for sentimentality:  “Changing what we eat and letting tastes fade from memory create a kind of cultural loss, a forgetting. But perhaps this kind of forgetfulness is worth accepting – even worth cultivating (forgetting, too, can be cultivated). To remember animals and my concern for their well-being, I may need to lose certain tastes and find other handles for the memories they once helped me carry.  Remembering and forgetting are part of the same mental process. To write down one detail of an event is to not write down another (unless you keep writing forever). To remember one thing is to let another slip from remembrance (unless you keep recalling forever). … So the question is not whether we forget but what, or whom, we forget – not whether our diets change, but how.”  I don’t eat meat. And I don’t understand one bit of those paragraphs. Foer is cultivating a forgetting by not eating meat? He’s finding “other handles” to hold on to his memories involving meat? What? Let me go back to that definition he wrote for bull….    Finally, we see another trip on the overwrought personal narrative road. He writes, “This is nontrivial, but it’s the main reason that I wouldn’t eat pigs from Paul Willis’s farm or chickens from Frank Reese’s – something that is hard to write knowing that Paul and Frank, now friends of mine, will read these words.” (Loc 2642).  This meta-biography, the writer going through so much suffering because his two “friends” will read these word, is nauseating.    “Eating Animals” tries to be a daring, muckraking piece of journalism, but comes off like a “New Yorker” article gone wrong. The engaging start, family history combined with economics of pets, is quickly lost with the book’s complex structuring and unclearvoices. It’s overly sentimental, with constant appeals to emotion, and gaudy in style, using rhetorical devices to count and explain. It's an attempt at non-fiction, but Jonathon Safran Foer’s talents are best left in the world of fiction.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|First of all, I did not buy this DVD through amazon, I watched it on my Xbox360 via streaming service.<br /><br />So here's the deal..<br /><br />Two scientist are wanting to help mankind through genetic manipulation, of course they work for an evil corporation that doesn't want any part of this, mainly because &#34;bad press&#34;... But also one of the scientist on the team has other motives, which you will get to see unfold. I guess you'd call it a plot twist.<br />The corp head (I assume) tell's them that their lab is going to be re-tooled, and set up to find these genes, out of these.. mutated silk worms, that they have created.<br /><br />Yadda Yadda.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a movie made in America. If anything can go bad, its going to go bad, because apparently in America we love bad news?.. so right their is the rest of your movie.<br /><br />It always amazes me, how technology and the awesome possibilities that exist... always get slathered over with crap and blood. I don't know what it is. I guess the directors who make these scifi movies, maybe its the investor that push on the stories? thinks that we don't want to see the awesome future that could possibly happen with all this tech..heck maybe they can't envision a better non cliche ending? Instead its &#34;bad bad bad ur creation gonna kill you&#34; or some such stuff. They're stuck in these &#34;Genres&#34;.. oh its scifi, and horror... couldn't possibly be scfi and horror, yet turns out to be awesome?<br /><br />If you see a new scifi movie come out of hollywood, 9 out of 10, you can just guess &#34;Hey this movie is going to end up in disaster and show us how horrible tech is&#34; and you'll be right. I've been watching scifi movies since I was a kid.. and I know their are a few movies that go a different direction but over all this cliche of &#34;tech and science is horrible and aliens are horrible and are going to kill you&#34;... is a long lasting trend. (Glad Firefly and StarTrek exist..)<br /><br />The movie over all has a pace that will keep you on your feet. Even if you have ADD... because things are just moving so quickly.. and the scenes jump about.  Watch it if you don't want to be bored. It's not gory.. or anything like that, the whole movie trys to keep you in &#34;Suspense&#34;t..)<br /><br />The movie over all has a pace that will keep you on your feet.

B006X415GK|1.0|After purchasing the Skelita and Robecca Steam dolls, I was impressed with their detail and beauty, so I decided to buy another one for my desk (I am an artist). I thought this doll was the way to go given the fact that she is gray scale (how unique, right?). The second I took her out of the box I was disappointed. Her hair is HARD AS A ROCK ... it's almost as if it were styled with glue. Parts of the lighter grey locks even have a yellow tinge (I'm guessing from whatever material they used to harden it). I suppose it's a good thing this doll comes with ZERO accessories (no purse, brush or diary), because her hair cannot be brushed or styled in any way. Her outfit is just meh, very cheap, plain and simple, and it lacks the detail so many other dolls have in their clothing. Finally, both of her thighs have awful seams running down the length with extra plastic, as if it overran the mold.<br /><br />Simply not good. She pales in comparison in every way to other dolls in this collection. Save your money.
B00G118LYY|1.0|So i downloaded this for my daughter when it was the free app of the day.  Tried playing it and the game would close every time the Toca load up screen started.  I uninstalled and tried reinstalling, but the app just disappeared from the Amazon app store.  It appears on the google play store but shows that i have to pay for it.  So was the game free app of the day or was it just a scam??
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally was pleased that this game is on kindle.  Love it, wish I can get off level 147 between on it way way to long.  Lol.  But truly enjoy this game.
B000OW8DW6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I'm not even sure how I originally came across this movie, but I was blown away when I first viewed it.  The movie is set in the not-too-distant future, but paints a very bleak image of how life is and how desperate conditions have gotten across the globe.  You definitely feel the desperation throughout the film.  The movie feels incredibly real throughout and doesn't seem to follow the typical &#34;hollywood&#34; script.  There are a lot of unexpected events that take place that leave you with your jaw dropped.  This isn't a feel good type of movie, but if you're into movies that deviate from the norm then I'd definitely recommend checking out this masterpiece by Cuaron.  This movie made me a fan of Cuaron and I'll likely watch anything that he puts out going forward just because his combination of cinematography and storytelling is pretty mesmerizing.
1935597760|5.0|It's hard to say what McKenna's greatest strength is; characterization, plot, or dialogue, but this author masterfully intertwines personal tragedy and a comedy of errors search for romance in a most original page turner, only to discover that sometimes what we dream of is right there in our own back yard.

B00ABO609A|4.0|Trying to find a movie for a rainy Saturday night, I happened upon &#34;Keep the Lights On&#34;. This is not the normal gay film festival film. The genre has 100s of movies, many not worth watching. This movie was entertaining and stimulating (in non-sexual way). The characters and story are well developed. The theme being addictions. Which gay men have many problems with addictions. So do many Americans, look at all the overweight people out there. While meant for all adult audiences, this movie could be educational for isolated parts of America. Emotionally and visually raw film in many ways. It depicts gay people as having all the problems of all Americans. Not disappointing, I wish I actually had seen this film when it came out.

B000YDOOUK|4.0|Runnin’ Wild, the debut album by Airbourne has more in common with AC/DC than just being from Australia.  The boys know how to rock.  Front man, Joel O’Keeffe (vocals and lead guitar)  seeming channels the high voltage energy from the late AC/DC vocalist, Bon Scott.  The vocals are not the only aspect that sounds like AC/CD.  If I were told this was the new AC/DC album prior to listening to it, I would have totally fallen for the hoax.  Airbourne also consists of Joel’s brother, Ryan on drums,  guitarist David Roads, and bassist Justin Street.<br /><br />The energy of Runnin’ Wild starts high, with their opening song, “Stand up for Rock ’n’ Roll”, and maintains throughout to the last song, “Let’s Ride”.  “Runnin’ Wild”, the title track and adrenaline inducer,  also appears on the Madden ’08 in-game soundtrack.<br /><br />My favorite tracks of this collection, “Diamond in the Rough”,  and “Too Much, Too Young, Too Fast” are both quite catchy and have become those songs I look forward to while listening to the CD.  And yes, I could easily just fast forward to these tracks, but I would rather listen to the rest of the CD.  It is very good.

I am thrilled that this special is going to give a treat to all of us who have stayed with the show over the years. Amazon is not saying if they will include special 3d glasses for this disc but maybe if we cross our fingers, this will be the case. I should also state you really should have a bag of jelly babies for this event.

B00BEXB18M|5.0|Here`s to another great album! I will have to admit that it took a few listens to get into and appreciate this album but it has a little bit of everything in it and it`s a departure from what they have put out in recent years. It`s good to see that they can still write stuff that is relevant and still sound really cool. Megadeth will always be one of those bands who you will either love or hate.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|excellent story telling I look forward to reading the whole series. It seems that the book ended way to soon.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Although it was well written, I found it extremely depressing, not a particularly enjoyable read.  The subject matter IS depressing, but the author might have interjected some lighter moments to balance the story more.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Perfect for Netflix and Youtube. Sometimes while casting a tab there's a delay between what's see on the laptop and what's on the tv, but the audio and video on tabs were in sync on the tv so that's good. Only negative thing is that it needs more apps and better support for desktop sharing. But at this price, it's a killer device and thus gets 5stars from me!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Plus:<br />Works as described, super easy to setup (even a cavemen can do it ;) ) .  Streams better than my BluRay player even on WiFi.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Still a new technology and not a lot of apps support it.
098478280X|5.0|Awesome book, has helped me develop my thinking and problem solving skills.

0316204366|4.0|One again, Gladwell delivers a thought-provoking, against-the-grain book, forcing readers to rethink perspectives they’ve always taken for granted. In this book, he addresses what fans of underdogs everywhere have always wanted to believe, but never could: that what seem to be clear disadvantages can in fact be huge advantages. In that respect, Gladwell gives readers a lot to think about, spanning examples in scale from huge, powerful governments fighting civilian insurgencies down to individual dyslexics fighting to overcome their disability and turn it into an advantage.<br /><br />As with his past books, though, his arguments—while always provocative—aren’t always fully convincing. Sometimes, it’s merely the result of overextending an idea beyond what’s entirely credible or logical. For example, after citing several clear cases where a small handful of dyslexics becomes huge successes *despite* their disability, he readily admits that a large percentage of them end up in prison or in other dire straits. Yet, he still goes so far as to question whether having a dyslexic child is bad at all, and even suggests people might not be all that wrong to wish it for their offspring!<br /><br />And sometimes, the lack of persuasiveness is the result of data that just doesn’t seem complete or bulletproof (at least not in the way he portrays it). For example, his entire section on Three Strikes laws takes a highly critical view of it, but doesn’t quite come across as convincing (and, in fact, his notes on that section at the back of the book introduces some more data which seem, in fact, to bolster the Three Strikes law in states other than California!). I left feeling very unconvinced about his argument (and was even somewhat confused by his choice of a counterargument to it—a story of a pacifist family that essentially did nothing in the face of a horrifying crime victimizing them).<br /><br />Again, though, despite the shortcomings and dissatisfaction with some of his arguments, they all still come across as thought-provoking and interesting, which always makes for a great book.
0143124544|5.0|Loved it but it really did strike nerve.  It's one of those books that you love for truth it shares but also makes you stop and think and consider the choices in your own life.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Really unusually for a second movie of a series, I thought that this was a much stronger story than the first one.  Watching Mike and Sulley act like jerks is a little painful after having gotten attached to them from Monsters Inc., but since the story is essentially how they get over it, make friends, and grow up a little, I think it's a worthwhile price to pay.<br /><br />Most situations and side-characters varied from amusing to hilarious, and you get to see a little more of how the monster world works.  There's still a bunch of excitement and action, but it seemed more character-driven and purposeful compared to the sometimes hapless running around of the first movie.<br /><br />If, like me, you think you know what to expect from standard college coming-of-age stories, dream-chasing stories, or even from a story that has to end up as the world you see in Monsters Inc... this movie will throw you at least three or four serious curveballs.  But each one just makes the movie better.

1476727651|5.0|I finished Doctor Sleep in basically a day. The first 150 pages was a lot of set up and introducing of a lot of characters. After that, the book exploded. Non-stop action and building tension. The ending was one of King's best book endings ever. I'm thankful his son, Owen, made sure the \\"bottom out\\" was not neglected. The main characters and secondary characters were so well drawn, I knew them. And I will miss them. I love the man Dan Torrence became in the story. And his past --the in-between years-- were what you might expect, and fear. The same goes for Abra. She was the \\"Danny.\\" She may follow in his footsteps ... she probably will. But hopefully she turns out to be a wonderful woman, the \\"Dan.\\" And maybe, just maybe, if we as fans are lucky enough, a woman King will one day visit in the future. I teared up a few times at the very end. I don't want to spoil the read for anyone, but was happy to see good ghosts. one in particular. even if fleeting. one disappointment ... Tony. Where was he the 2nd half of the book? Just forgotten? Well, I suppose he is off assisting another child with ... The Shining.
006202406X|1.0|I enjoyed the first 2 books and had been eagerly awaiting the last book in the set. I started reading it as soon as I downloaded it and what a GIANT disappointment. Its slow, depressing, wanders around with no real story line and the ending SUCKED!!!!!!!  SERIOUSLY????  Thats how you're ending it????  I feel like the author was trying to make this a great tragedy but it just turned into a disaster. It left me feeling empty, hollow and upset. I haven't been this let down by a series in a long time. :(
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Taut thriller that capitalizes on the previous &#34;The Lion&#34; by moving the strong personalities of the US anti-terrorist community overseas to a little-known Yemen.  Not only is it a thriller, but it imparts interesting background of Yemen and the terrorist philosophies.  Some may say that the treatment of Islam is politically incorrect, but DeMille refuses to compromise on his language. All in all, a wonderful read that keeps the reader involved continuously.  If there is anything wrong with the book, it may be that the ending was a bit abrupt, and somewhat predictable if you read &#34;The Lion&#34;.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|The second effort in the &#34;Before&#34; Trilogy provides a nice bridge between &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; and &#34;Before Midnight&#34;; both of which provide stronger story lines and efforts by the principle actors. I made it a goal to watch the &#34;Trilogy&#34; in their correct order and that made the entire series much more enjoyable - an approach that I would highly recommend to any movie viewer. Whereas, most sequels fail to hang together in series, these three nuggets provide just the correct steps, one-to-another. My wife and I also made it a goal to watch the series together which, in my mind, is the best way to immerse oneself into the story and to gain the most out of it. Well done, now on to the conclusion, &#34;Before Midnight&#34;.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|I complained to Amazon about very poor audio on a recent movie and Amazon responded to my complaint promptly suggesting perhaps a network connection problem.  Problem was in the cable connections between the Roku and the TV.<br /><br />Matilda is a good movie and we are looking forward to seeing it with our granddaughter on Broadway as the musical.  Still $13 for a movie out several years is a bit steep as was $7 for the non HD version.
B00G32OMF8|5.0|This is a couples movie without peer!<br /><br />If you have ever had a rocky patch in your married relationship, this movie does the best job of addressing so much of the baseline difference between men and women and their most important relationships. Delphi and Hawke are flawless in their takes on the characters in the piece and especially in their place in time. This story has a very difficult set of criteria to match when actors have to play the same characters over en extended period of time. The &#34;Trilogy&#34; visits the two characters in their 20's, 30's and 40's and the movies were made approximately 9 years apart and that is perfect because of the natural aging processes and the deeper maturation processes of the actors. The &#34;Midnight&#34; story conclusion does the best in dealing with those tricky conclusion situations of any movie I have watched. If there were a sixth star allowed, this would be the only relationship movie that I would have awarded such a coveted star.<br /><br />Well done all around and the ending will leave one wondering and lost in thought as to what the next steps would be as the human story continues.
B008JFUR10|3.0|The story is just a peg to hang action on. No depth whatsoever to any aspect of the story or characters. Very much a live action Saturday morning cartoon.  Which is not necessarily a slam, that may have been the intention. I liked it, but only barely would I call it worthwhile.  After the surprise depth of the story on Hellboy 2, I expected more from Del Toro.  The two main characters , one guy and one girl have an obvious love interest from the beginning, and they don't even kiss at the end. You can feel the mindset of the movie thinking &#34;EEwww, girls are yucky, go back to giant robots fighting monsters&#34; This could have been an awesome grown up spectacle movie if there were more than one dimension.
B00EQF0JJC|4.0|Not good for a first introduction to the play but if you are already familiar with the story it is easy to follow and a nice change of pace. All the actors seem to be having fun and despite some other reviews I think the short span of filming adds to the charm. It is not Kenneth Branagh but it's not trying to be. It does;however, come from the same kind of love of the play as many of Branagh's adaptations alogh with the intimate atmosphere of Whedon's readings of the play in his home.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Just like the title said.<br />This is the best game I have ever played on the Kindle Fire, or any touchscreen platform.
B003WUYR6I|4.0|Well-defined characters, good plot and a page-turner!  I Liked how he pulled all his key characters together in one book.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Better than Facebook's Farmville.<br />No friends necessary. highly entertaining and addictive.<br />I love the graphics.<br />It is highly addictive. I have recommended to my friends.
B008JFUN6E|2.0|The movie has a nice start: The makers a.k.a. the rich people have seperated themsevles from the takers a.k.a. the poor people on Elysium where they have great healthcare and enjoy the good life they deserve. But then a car-thief on parole, who can't accept that someone has a better life then himself and thinks everybody should have the same standard of living, regardless of his achievments ruins everything by socializing healthcare.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun game. Lots of quests that keep it interesting .The story line is pretty good too. Definitely a better hidden object game than most.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I purchased this book as soon as it came out. As always John Grisham did not disappoint. I have read every book John Grisham has written, with the exception of two or three. I found this book to be amazing. It is brilliantly written, a masterpiece. If you are a John Grisham fan, you will want to read this book. I highly recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just got this from Amazon this past Friday on my Kindle Fire.  I am new to the game.  All my friends have been telling me to play the game.  I can't wait to see my friends on Monday, and they will be so surprised!!!  I am on number 5, just beginning, and it seems like a lot of fun.  I like the way the game is set up - so colorful.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This reminds me of the puzzle games in the Nancy Drew computer games. I hope they come up with new levels.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I can't take the picture backwards. You need to be behind the camera unless of course you want to take a picture of yourself.
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|Well written, interesting, good study of the characters and excellent plot.<br />The story is well balanced between the generations and plausible!
B00D1DBO1C|5.0|Great basic calendar and planner, got it for tracking my personal schedule on my Kindle, does what I want... Not trying to do elaborate synch with other calendars, just keeping up with personal schedule and important family and friend events (birthdays, anniversaries, special occasions)
B008B1BL4E|5.0|The book is very informative and easy to understand. I loved the background explanations and interpretations. Some were unexpected and surprising interpretations.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love. This app it's great for practicing and playing piano and is good for playing with both hands. Great game.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Change the ending. There's no reason to kill the main character/hero. People need to be warned of how you end this series. I imagine you'll change it in the movies so why not satisfy your loyal readers?
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|wonderful idea to have it all together, chance to hear the older CDs I hadn't been able to locate;<br />the man is AMAZING, his talent is vast;  I never get tired of listening to him, he has so many styles.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|Love Pink Martini. We've heard them live and love having them in disc form around the house and in the car as well. Nice collection of a wide variety of styles and songs.....highly recommend this.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The novel is very entertaining.  My only problem is that I find it difficult to see so many characters from so many far flung places continually interacting with one another.  A bit of a stretch.
0930289234|5.0|This has got to be one of the best graphic novels ever written. There's a big epic cast, crazy story, all kinds of drama, and a blue superhero to boot. Alan Moore redefined comics with Watchmen. Who watches the Watchmen? I do.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app for horse lovers. Love the graphics, games and horses. Absolutely wonderful game! Everyone should have the ability to own it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|*Jumps up and down* Finally got my hands on these bad boys, and with Jamie playing Christian on screen I knew I had to read the series, because well I love Jamie and I didn't want to go into the theater blind and I like comparing books to the movies. Christian....oh boy at times he needs a good a** beating, other times I loved his protectiveness, &#34;well, you'd better drive carefully.&#34; His tone is stern, authoritative. Why should he care? &#34;Did you get everything you need?&#34; he adds.&#34; At times I kinda thought he was a woman on his rag and really bi-polar, and he just can't make up his mind about certain things. And there were a few parts that killed me emotionally where I really wanted to murder the boy, &#34;no, Anastasia. I don't do the girlfriend thing.&#34; And he's just odd at times, &#34;well, if you were mine, you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday. You didn't eat, you got drunk, you put yourself at risk.&#34; And like any other male he has to cherish his favorite part of his body, &#34;I want you to become well acquainted, on first name terms if you will, with my favorite and most cherished part of my body. I'm very attached to this.&#34; And Ana is a firecracker and I honestly don't understand why Christian has issues on her issues about spending money at least you know she ain't no gold-diggin' hoe! &#34;It's taking all my self-control not to eff you on the hood of this car right now, just to show you that you are mine, and if I wnat to buy you a effing car. I'll buy you a effing car,&#34; he growls. &#34;Now let's get you inside and naked.&#34; Sometimes I think they're relationship is all about sex I mean I know right? What a cray-cray thing to think. And the ending let's not start on that just thank the lord I have the next book in the series.
023076651X|5.0|This book was a fun read, very inspirational and just the push I needed (and wanted) to get out there and pursue my own business. In fact, I liked it so much, I gave my version to a friend and bought another for someone else thinking of starting their business. This is the perfect book for people on the edge.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well, Christian you still have issues, BUT I liked you a little more in this book especially where Ana's safety and well being were involved, &#34;I don't want your smart mouth now. Answer me.&#34; His eyes blaze.&#34; And he's still possessive, &#34;I bought them all, Anastasia. I don't want some stranger ogling you in the privacy of their home.&#34; And he doesn't like other men really around her so he always has to make a stand, &#34;well, no longer ex,&#34; Christian replies calmly. &#34;Come on, baby, time to go.&#34; And he really makes sure Ana is taking care of especially exercise wise, &#34;but I want you fit, baby, for what I have in mind. I'll need you to keep up.&#34; Ana still as saucy as ever if not more so, &#34;I want to get my hair cut, preferably somewhere where you haven't effed either the staff or the clientele.&#34; We see a more playful side of Christian in this installment and I really enjoyed seeing that, &#34;you look good,&#34; Christian purrs from the bed. &#34;You can call in sick, you know.&#34; And Ana she's getting to be a bossy little thing, it's really great to see her grow, &#34;you turned me on, big time. Now take me home and eff me.&#34; I'm ready for the third installment.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Firstly, The 5 stars are both for the series itself, and the product itself. If you've never seen The West Wing, you're missing out on one of the best ensemble dramas there is. Not to mention it's a great insight (however fictional) into how the presidential office runs, and contains episodes with incredible story lines and issues (gov't shutdown? Homosexuals in the Military? A dictator causing mass genocide? Islamic Fundamentalists?) that sometimes end with the office 'winning' and sometimes with them losing. Whether you're a liberal or Democrat (the party of the president in the series) or not, you can appreciate the struggle and conflict inherent in running the nation. Plus there is an incredible cast.<br /><br />Secondly, this product is incredible. Over the summer I managed to watch the entire series, and so I had started to buy the DVDs, starting with season 1. Since that's all I had, when the complete series came on sale at $75, I couldn't resist. There are seven seasons spread over forty five discs in all. You get the screenplay for the pilot episode, and an episode guide, and of course the discs for all seven seasons. There doesn't seem to be any extra special features than what are already on the previous release, so if you're buying this to replace the 7 seasons in other format, it's probably not worth the money. All of the discs are packaged into thin cardboard folders, one for each season, so that everything fits into the box. Faux-leather is wishing a little too much, but the box is a sturdy paper covered cardboard with a magnet closure and looks great.<br /><br />Now, onto the issues other reviewers have encountered.<br /><br />When I received the series, the first thing I did was open it and make sure I had all the discs and check for scratches. Once that was done, I spent a weekend playing all 45 discs. Tedious? Very, although I simply skipped through by chapter to make sure the audio and visual played, then continued on. But I surmised that all ofmy discs were playable, and only 3 out of the 45 had scratches. Yes the paper envelopes hold them closely, and scratches are pretty probably because of that, but a few small scratches aren't cause for alarm, and people forget you can fill scratches and it's generally still playable. If you take them out carefully, and make sure dust/sand don't get into the envelopes, I can't see this being a problem.<br />I've also read a few reviews about missing discs, blank discs, missing other things, and can only assume someone was buying them from a 3rd party seller who wasn't honest, but selling on the cheap. Always read those seller reviews! I bought directly through Amazon and the product came brand new, shrink-wrapped, with adequate padding and no damage whatsoever. Perhaps there was at one point someone who was selling these for a sham on Amazon, but Amazon itself is selling the real deal.<br /><br />And a bonus feature-the first few seasons of The West Wing were packaged on double sided discs originally when they were released, which causes playing problems (like my original season one). This set has everything on one-sided discs, and I haven't caught any lags, pixelated bits, or problems so far that I have on a few of my other season one discs (found after the return period ended). To me this is worth the set rather than the individuals.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd definitely buy this product from Amazon. I got it for $75 during the pre-black friday sale, so the price was perfect for the product and I'm very pleased.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|It was well done, but honestly it was a bit to depressing for me.  I was happier with her first book.
1451666179|5.0|Absolutely, fall out of your chair laughing with this book. If you're a fan of Brosh's blog, Hyperbole and a Half, you'll love it. There are a few posts taken from the blog and inserted into the book, but there is plenty of new stuff to love! The simple MS Paint technique she uses to illustrate stories that are in some cases unbelievable is great. My one complaint would be to make it all completely new material, but since the older things are good posts, it's great. There are quite a few dog chapters too, which I love!<br />Also, her two chapters of Adventures in Depression are incredible. A serious condition for many people that's made completely understandable. I've never had depression, but those two chapters helped me to understand this condition my friends have had a lot better than anything else I've seen.<br /><br />All in all, buy this book. If you like to laugh, and like crazy stories with unique drawings, you won't be disappointed.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I use this for my Hexbright flashlight. It fits it very well and the ability to rotate it I find a great idea. I can clip it on my belt and rotate it forward to see where I'm going hands free.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Quick good read for a plane ride. Or a weekend by the swimming pool. Reading the next two as well.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I had heard a lot about this game, so I was excited when it came available for the Kindle.  I generally like puzzle games, but I was disappointed.  #1: the music is not exciting or peppy. I turned it off, so the boring music would not make me feel more bored!  #2: whenever a new goal is shown, it is not well-explained, so I'd waste a heart or 2 before I'd figured it out what I was suppsed to do.  #3: you have a maximum of 5 hearts/lives.  Once you use those up, you have to wait for the timer or be connected to facebook to ask for more.  I don't use facebook, so that was not an option for me. #4: I didn't feel like there was a strategy to figure out to pass the level, like what I'd expect from a puzzle game.  Sometimes, it is just random luck.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Where to start....I guess it'll have to be the beginning because there definitely was no ending.  This book started slowly and I had a difficult time getting through the first few chapters. Somewhere in the middle things start to pick up and you follow along as both characters tell their side of this unbelievable story. The author gets you involved in the many twisted scenarios for the buildup to the end but the actual end felt like she just quit the book. It was as if she didn't know quite how to finish it so a period was placed at the end of the last sentence on the bottom of the last page. I was not impressed!
B009AMAGQM|1.0|I understand that movies cant fit in every last detail that is in a book but this movie was so far from the original story line that they might as well of not said it was based off of the book. Half of the major characters werent in the movie; I could understand leaving out a couple minor characters that didnt have much to do with the whole story line but when they got rid of Marion and Ethans aunts I was like, WTF they were essential to how and why certain things happened<br />. I went to see this in the theaters with my freind (who did n8t read the book) and see was lost at many point. I had to explain parts that happened in the book for the events in the movie to make sence.<br />The whole movie was just too discombobulated and the facts that they did decide to include were wrong. Macons choice of clothes, wrong-enterior of leahs house, wrong-libraian ( what the hell, if you include the library how hard is it really, to get someone to play marion?
B00571F26Y|4.0|Good information that makes sense! Especially for those of us over 55. I already put many of these principles into practice, but helped solidify my resolve!

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Its a great blessing to have this game, I would highly advise this game to anyone it is very profitable
0743270754|5.0|The movie &#34;Lincoln&#34;, supposedly partly based on this book, covered a very small part of it. It gave me a real feel for the times and what Lincoln had to go through to win the Civil War. I had not appreciated what a great man Seward was, who at first was a rival. Leaders must include people on their staff, or in this case cabinet, who are willing to criticize and offer alternative ideas. In Lincoln's case some of his cabinet worked against him in non-constructive ways. Politics has not changed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Found this game bout a year ago and started playing still love it even when I stop playing for a period of time I just fall in love w the challenge it gives.  Only thing I don't like is how your mind is faster than the moves lil and I hats that you have to wait so long if you don't pass the first time lil.  Still feel it's addictive but loads of fun!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very good, i saw a film from Play Store Movies. Fine vision.<br />fair price for this device. probably better than the competitors
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This third book was not as good as the other two it wasn't bad but I was able to put it down and go do other things the others I didn't put down til the end they were so interesting.

006202406X|2.0|Having two perspectives created a lot of redundancy. It was like Roth couldn't come up with enough of an outline. The worst part was how weak of a person she made Four into and how Trish at times was a know it all brat.  Still it was an okay read.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|can't wait for the movie....<br />I can only imagine who they will get to play as Christian, oh my he will need to be a hunk! what about the guy who played Thor?
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|It might be strange to talk about a great character when you are reading a book about a multiple AI but trust me that this book is well worth the money and the time.  It requires you to pay some attention but then you get caught up in the world building and actually care about the protagonist and the surrounding characters.  I will certainly read the next instalment of Breq/One Esk/Justice of Torens.<br /><br />As an aside, I've been reading sci fi since Andre Norton and I read Honor Harrington when Weber first brought her books out.  I know a good book when I read it.
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|Great to see David Tennant, The Tenth Doctor & Billie Piper Again! Seems like years since I have seen Rose Tyler!<br />But where is Christopher Eccleston? In July 2012, Christopher Eccleston spoke positively of his time on Doctor Who during a talk at the National Theatre. This led to speculation he was considering making a return appearance as the Ninth Doctor for the show's 50th anniversary in 2013. The current Doctor, Matt Smith, stated that he would love Eccleston to return but Eccleston declined for some reason after discussing with executive producer Steven Moffat to return to Doctor Who. And where is Captain Jack Harkness? (played by John Barrowman). We want both Christopher Eccleston and Captain Jack, Back! :(<br /><br />The cover photo shows the sideviews of both Matt Smith and David Tennant, the tenth doctor, with veteran star, John Hurt walking toward us from an explosion.<br /><br />Hoping they show a clip of all the actors who played Doctor Who and his companions for the last 50 years. I started watching as a kid on late-nite PBS Channel 9, and  Doctor Who Marathons, back in the day, early 70's, with The Third Doctor Jon Pertwee who played him from 1970-1974.<br /><br />\\"Doctor Who: Day of the Doctor<br /><br />\\"The Day of the Doctor\\" stars outgoing Doctor Matt Smith, predecessor David Tennant, the Tenth Doctor, Jenna Coleman, Billie Piper (Yay! Rose is Back) and John Hurt. The special marks the first time Tennant and Piper have appeared in the series since their farewells in 2010. According to BBC America, the special will be \\"a celebration for long-time fans and an opportunity for those new to the series to jump onboard.\\" But Clara Oswald the Doctor's new companion or Clara Oswin Oswald, otherwise known as the Impossible Girl as she keeps Popping up and coming back after death thru-out Time played by newcomer Jenna-Louise Coleman is my most favorite companion for Doctor Who as she's the only one who can out-talk Doctor Who. The new Clara was \\"more grounded and so far easier for the viewer to latch on to\\" than her two predecessors, both of which could have been harder to sustain as companions and she has the potential to be \\"a truly great companion\\", and that it was \\"refreshing to see a companion who isn't in total awe of the Doctor... and she's not afraid to take the lead when she needs to, actually saving the Doctor (not a helpless female). Moffat chose her for the role because she worked the best alongside Smith and could actually talk faster than him. Also Incarnations of herself are scattered throughout the Doctor's history, appearing to every known face of the Doctor and saving his life in numerous ways--for the most part unnoticed--and even ensuring that the First Doctor (William Hartnell) picks the right TARDIS on his home planet, prior to the events of the show's first episode.<br /><br />In a statement, Smith said: \\"The Day of the Doctor is nearly here! Hope you all enjoy. There's lots more coming your way, as the countdown to the 50th begins now.\\"<br />\\"The Thick of It\\" star \\"Peter Capaldi\\" will replace Smith in the titular role beginning with Season 8. On one of the 50th Anniversary poster it showed Doctor Who's wife, River Song played by Alex Kingston. Wonder if their will be an appearance?<br /><br />Veteran Star \\"John Hurt\\" has revealed that his role in the 50th anniversary episode of TV's Doctor Who was one of the `toughest' challenges of his career. The actor, who will play an earlier reincarnation of the Time Lord in The Day Of The Doctor said, \\"He had `given his life' over to the part so he could get to grips with the script's `quasi-scientific nonsense'.<br /><br />The 73-year-old star of the Alien, Elephant Man and the Harry Potter movies also dismissed a lot of modern television as `PAP' and said he was planning to cut back on his work commitments so he could spend more time indulging his passion for Painting. Hurt, who will star with Matt Smith and David Tennant in the episode, said: `It wasone of the toughest parts I have had to learn, as difficult as anything I have done. `There is a lot of quasi-scientific nonsense which doesn't stay in your head that easily and that meant entire weekends spent on solid learning. `I remember Matt said I'd have to give my life over to it because there is a lot of learning and very little time to shoot.' I thought he was kidding.<br />Hurt's unexpected debut as the \\"War Doctor\\" in the dying seconds of the last series caused a sensation when it was broadcast in May. Last week the BBC released an online mini-episode, which revealed that his character had regenerated from the Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann.<br /><br />\\"The Zygons\\" and \\"The Daleks\\" will also be featured in the special as the Enemies. It has been confirmed that \\"paintings\\" will be a plot point of the episode, and that the \\"Time War\\" will be explained. The Zygons  first appeared in the Fourth Doctor serial Terror of the Zygons, where it was revealed that centuries ago, the Zygon homeworld was destroyed in a stellar explosion. A craft escaped and somehow made it to Earth, where it then crashed into Loch Ness. When the Doctor encountered the Zygons, they were led by a warlord named Broton. Broton wished to conquer the world to allow a refugee fleet of Zygons to colonize Earth. The Zygons have shape-shifting abilities, allowing them to replicate the appearance of another being, but they must keep the subject alive in order to use its body print. This skill was vital in their concealment and in their scheme to seize power despite their small numbers. The Zygons were also accompanied by an armoured cyborg creature called the Skarasen, the lactic fluid of which was necessary for them to feed. The Skarasen became the Loch Ness Monster. Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant has stated that they are his favourite monsters from Doctor Who.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|It is rare that the third book in a series in better then the first.  But Veronica Roth excelled in Allegiant!<br /><br />It was difficult to read at first.  Alternating writing in first person from Tris and Four's perspective.  But once I got used to it, the story became enthralling.  She covered some very deep issues that caused me to think about things in my own life.  (a bit cryptic, but I do not want to spoil the story.).<br /><br />Just read it!

B003VBNN54|5.0|my wife and I love to watch this move because it's a great story. you have to watch it and you'll see
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|If you are looking for a predictable poorly written book with no depth, here it is. I wouldn't suggest this to a reader of any age.
B001HMSFFC|5.0|Instant video Sex and the City the Movie.  It was interesting and i am glad to have it streamed right to my laptop.
B009RH9HDS|3.0|The leather cover is of good quality, nice finish.  The swivel function works fine.  However, the case itself that holds the kindle in place is not dependable.  The kindle is not secured within the snap in case; it can fall out at any time (it snaps in and out at will, constantly checking the kindle to make sure it is in place).  This is not my ultimate cover, this will be replaced by something that actually holds the kindle securely.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|I liked the movie it was interesting. I use to watch the TV show and wanted to compare this to it.
0783226837|5.0|just a fun movie with a unique plot. The characters in the movie are fun and suit the film. They make the film a great experience.
B00EQF2EIG|5.0|One of my favorite plays + one of my favorite directors + some of my favorite actors = GOLD! I loved it!
B00A3K2PZA|1.0|If you like movies with no hero this is the movie for you. It is a poor movie in my opinion.<br /><br />With cult fans it could be a favorite but for people like myself it lacks depth.
B003B02PEU|5.0|John Grisham at his best. The characters jump out and come alive page after page. An excellent book, through and through.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|What can you say.? The amazing Jeff Beck  honoring Les Paul<br />Does not get better!!  Guitar  enthusiast  Must Have for your listening pleasure
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Having read all of his books, this one is at the upper end of his story telling. Again I was intrigued by the first paragraph, and captured by the end of the first page. As he does so well, the beginning starts at a row of seemingly unimportant sycamore trees, and the understanding of why...occurs at the end.<br />  Beautifully woven characters, plots, relationships, and dialogue bring this story to life. And again as in his past books, I hate to see the pages go by and the ending coming. Through his writing one gets to know the characters so well that I miss them not being part of more of my days when the book ends. Again, great job John.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|What an excellent book. I love it. It gives you a lot to think about and really question where you are right now and hoe you actually feel about it. This is my third book of John Green. I'm pretty excited about the next books I'll read .
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Be careful where you put things, you can't move them once they are placed. They sure push buying coins like most Zynga games.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another page turner with all the expected twists & turns! The subject matter is relevant for today what with all the nasty racist implications & gives that look into the past which is still alive today, unfortunately! John makes you 'see' his characters. Always wonder if they're drawn from real life knowledge?
B00486070K|4.0|Worked as advertised. However, it would have been a lot better if it had LEDs to indicate connectivity and power when a cable is plugged in.
B006PZBR8S|2.0|Was fairly entertaining, not Hugh Jackman's best.  A decent movie for the family.  Would not be interested in seeing aagain.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Classic! You haven't watched TV if you haven't seen Breaking Bad. This is arguably the best season of the series. The writing and the acting are in a league of their own.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|my best George Clooney movie, warm, funny, a subject that many of us unfortunately can relate to.  Would recommend this film to friends and family.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Was on back order for about a month but worth the wait. Would get 5 stars if there were more services available to cast to your television but for $35, you can't go wrong.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great alarm clock. I love the different wake up music you can choose, and I prefer the come on.... slow, bird chirping, water fall sound...It makes you do a couple of yawn stretches with a slow; Okay, it's a new day kind of get-out-of-bed day! Sure is better than those annoying beep beep beep, get-in-your-face alarms!
B000QUEHNK|4.0|Loved it! Recommended by a friend who is published in the Czech Republic.  It isn't typical American fare but truly enjoyable if you like something a step off center.  Well written and completely kept my interest!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to come to kindle fire for so long I'm so happy its finally here!
B004SOR4H6|2.0|Unlike Tweetcaster, Twitter can't Tweet photos from a Kindle. Sure you can do that from  PC, and maybe other devices, but if it can be done from a Kindle, I haven't figured it out. Otherwise, I like it. But because of the above, back to Tweetcaster
B008MM9630|4.0|There are some bugs (it restarts a lot) but other then that its a cute game. I also wish some items didn't cost so many gems
B001EC2IXK|5.0|The cinematography is amazing. Absolutely breathtaking. Sometimes when I watch a really old film, I can lose interest in the stories and characters unless I really focus, but not with this film. Every shot is like a beautifully composed photograph. Also, if you're a fan of Breaking Bad, then you should definitely watch this.
B000002X2B|3.0|there are several places on this disc which skip and bounce over the music. If I had known this in advance, I would not have made the purchase. Having listened to the record, 'blows against the empire', for many years, I really cannot play the disc in this condition.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|It has three levels of:  Easy, Medium and Hard.  And all are hard to accomplish.  I like a challenge and all levels have there own level of difficulty.  I REALLY like it.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I stopped reading Stephen King's novels when they became gory.  I always preferred his suspenseful novels, and stopped reading for a while when some of his novels were just &#34;gross.&#34;  However, after I read Doctor Sleep, I became addicted to Mr. King's work again!  I had purchased 11/22/63 a while ago, but wasn't overly interested because I thought it might be just another Oswald conspiracy story.  I could not have been more wrong.  I couldn't stop reading this book and lost several hours of sleep,  but it was worth it.  I'm in awe of a novelist who not only creates such interesting stories, but also manages to incorporate his research as well.  Stephen King is THE master story teller !
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Having played castleville on Facebook I can say I am happy to have the opportunity to play on my kindle fire.  I hope they have more games at some point.
1885167776|4.0|I got introduced to The ONE Thing through 12booksgroup.com, an interesting online book club that explores business books. They held an online webinar with co-author Jay Papasan that was a nice addition to the reading experience.<br /><br />At first, The ONE Thing felt like a one-note diatribe. It seemed repetitive, and I couldn't imagine how the authors could fill an entire book with such a simple message. However, the concept has resonated with me for a couple of weeks. Each time I look at my task list, each time I plan my calendar, I think about what One Thing would make the most difference to the rest of what I have to do -- or want to do. Now, I can't say that I am perfect at selecting that One Thing just yet. But I can say that the principle of attempting to do so has made a pretty profound difference in the way I approach my daily work life (and even my personal life).<br /><br />The book is also thoughtfully designed. It's not going to get into Graphis as an example of gorgeous work. But functionally, it's engaging and informative. The authors took great pains to make sure that what they wanted to communicate was communicated memorably. The book is full of hand-drawn charts and graphs, and passages are underlined in \\"pencil\\" in the same way a reader would. At first I thought this would be distracting, but you get used to it quickly and it does seem to enhance the reading experience.<br /><br />All in all, reading The ONE Thing was enlightening, enjoyable and, yes, even inspiring. I'd recommend it.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Book 2 of the series may start really slow but the further you get into it the better it gets. can't wait for the third.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was so awesome. Great story line good acting. You get the feeling that you are in that time period.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|phone didn't fit. very limited size wise. Had an s2 and couldn't use it. Had HTC 1 mini can't use it.
0061950726|5.0|Author did a very good job in describing a part of America's past that I didn't even know existed. I loved the unlikely friendship between Molly and Vivian. Shows us that the gap between age and generation doesn't have to be a barrier to a relationship.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Use it all the time. Cheap and works great! Amazing clarity and volume when watching youtube or Netflix. Highly recommended
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I am a very high ranked game taster and this tasted like the hobbit and the expendables it was truly Boris and I wish I chose take-out
B006RXSW5O|3.0|I believe this is a comedy but I don't find it very funny or very entertaining.  It doesn't seem to have a plot; just clerks in a store talking about nothing.
B008K8VDPU|2.0|This is disapointing at least on a small kindle.  The keys are too close together for it to work correctly.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|Love this product easy to put it and easy to take out very good as a regular cover. i have 2 toddlers and they love to play with my phone i thought that the cover was going to get dirty easier but not at all. and is easy to clean! i totally recommended
B009VA1FN6|5.0|My favourite Kate Morton book. Every chapter gave a few more clues to the mystery surrounding the murder of a stranger by a doting, fun-loving mother and a photograph that unexpectedly surfaced 40 years later. The plot twist at the end was a totally enjoyable surprise.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its so so so fun I love horses so this is a great app to have my sister especially loves it because she has a horse
B0031RS2HC|4.0|It kept me gripped and guessing. The writing style is a bit difficult to get along with sometimes but the story makes up for it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Would give 5 stars, keeps five year old entertained for many hours. Game is graphically very attractive and engaging. Great game!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|The title should be enough.This game is very addicting. It will become even more addicting.once they add global multiplayer. I can't wait.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Simple handy tool! One can start and play, very intuitive, start and use, nothing complex. I like the big graphics.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I totally enjoyed the book around chapter 5 after I made all of the connections of the people as it jumped a bit for me in the beginning.  The butterfly effect wa well written at the end as so many of us wonder &#34;what if&#34;.........
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Great simple tool for a tablet, yet it has the versatility of a simple note making feature. Just load the program, name the file, and you can make notes immediately.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive!  I don't know what it is about it but you always feel the need to get to the next level.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm 60 and it keeps my brain thinking, I love the challenge and I look forward to try and beat the game!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig plays a fabulous job of portraying James Bond. M, bless her heart will be missed. This could be a transitional film to the new era of James Bond.
B00C8S9VKM|1.0|Bryson in fine form with stories and observations that will be fresh, even to folks who think they know the period well.  He praises the pioneers who first touched this era, such as Frederick Lewis Allen and Mark Sullivan and he is fully up to the standard they set, with the benefit of scholarship over the decades.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am happy to finally have this game available from Amazon. It has been my favorote game for a long time. The graphics are good and I've not had lag problems from it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book and spent more hours than I should have finishing it today.  It's another winner for John Grisham.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|It really wants your money. You run out of energy in the game and you either have to wait 10 minutes or make an in app purchase. I would rather pay up front then have the constant request for my money during the game. Our freezes a lot too, and I have a new Kindle HD.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|I can't seem to figure out how this game works. Sometimes 3 cubes of the same color will fall off, but then sometimes it takes 4 or more cubes. I don't know how you win this game, which is frustrating. After the first day of having it, I quit playing. It makes no sense that I can figure out and I don't like games that I feel are impossible to win.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Great writing skills ,convoluted  story . Since I love NY it was nice to see it  so well described .
B009EEFTMC|3.0|This will kill a few minutes if you don't have anything else to do. The camera puzzle is more interesting than the rest and harder, which makes it more fun. The music is annoying. It's not a game you can spend hours on, but it's a good way to kill time in the doctor's office or someplace like that because the puzzle mode is really quick.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Great movie start to a magnificent movie trilogy. This movie is a great template for any movie that does an origin story. Swear to me that you love this movie!
B007V5XT1O|5.0|I DO LIKE HER SINGING:) I LIKE THE WORDS SHE CHOSE;) AND THIS MY OPINION AND THAT IS THAT:) THANK-YOU FOR ASKING
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Superman returns in high fashion. Now this movie does have its flaws but they are out weighted by the greatness that is Man of Steel. Not every superhero movie needs to have a joke every five minutes like Iron Man 3. Marvel are great for what they are but anytime you see a marvel movie trailer and it looks like its going to be serious its not. Marvel movies are now comedy action superhero movies which is fine if you advertise it as a comedy. I loved Man of Steel for not being campy and cartoony. I can't wait for the sequel.
B005KDWUG4|4.0|It wouldn't be fair to pick at any one thing. In fact, I think the sound recording was better than &#34;Live at Barcelona&#34;. But somehow this was not as satisfying as their other Blu-ray. I think the songs just weren't as catchy.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book was absolutely fascinating!  I could not put it down, nor could I put down the other four after it.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|You can tell it was shot natively in HD. Usually dimly lit halls or venues appear &#34;grainy&#34;, but I did not detect that on this production. The sound engineering was above average, but not the best. I'd give it 75/100.Technicalities aside, the performances were top notch and the set greater than any stage I've seen in real life.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Not working with older models more than 3 years old, I have to buy another new TV in order to use it.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|this game is off the chain.  The first level is the hardest no doubt. after that it really isn't that hard. just mostly time consuming. Way to prolonging.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|Simple and fun and easy to control.Great pick up and play game.Basketball is a exciting sport to watch  and is addictive.
B00G8P2B4E|5.0|Great Family movie for all ages. Pixar did a good job with this prequel, enjoyable to watch with the kids.
B004GYY714|3.0|...but then it stopped working on my Kindle Fire.  Any time I try to play a station, the app ceases to work and requires a force close.  It still works well on my Android, but it's still very disappointing!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Duolingo!<br />My duolingo italian course is great! I am taking private classes, and this is the best, very clear pronunciation and reinforcement of vocabulary and verbs.
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|Honestly I wasn't blown away by this album as much as I was with her previous work. After hearing &#34;Born This Way&#34;, I felt that I was listening to the future of pop. Its blend of genres worked well together and, despite the eclecticism, all came together to form a common theme. ARTPOP, while having such gems as &#34;Venus&#34;, &#34;Aura&#34;, &#34;Applause&#34;, &#34;Gypsy&#34;, &#34;Dope&#34;, and &#34;Do What U Want&#34;, lacked that sort of cohesion. It was heavily hyped and I felt that despite it being a fairly strong pop record, it did not as much live up to the standard of her previous work. When she said she was bringing &#34;high art&#34; to pop music, I was a little weary. (In my opinion, that distinction goes to Joni Mitchell.) Regardless, she delivers some of her best vocal performances yet and the songs certainly work well as club jams. While it is not my favorite Gaga album, I would recommend it for a listen. Its disjointed themes may well be what she was getting at, but its not something I took to that much. Certainly the singles from the record are worth a listen. I would say that casual fans should start with those first and then delve into the album afterward. Overall, the album fails to live up to the hype, but then again, judging by the promotion, I would've expected no less than a &#34;Pet Sounds&#34; or a &#34;Kind of Blue&#34;. This certainly isn't that, but it is still a strong record.
B00F880BWG|5.0|&#34;The Walking Dead&#34; is my favorite show and to be able to watch it without commecials isimply connot be described!
B008RJFRTK|5.0|This is a great map app to see , what else, a map. It doesn't tell you where you are, it won't find the nearest gas station or fast food restaurant, and it won't give you step by step directions.  You get a map that you can use in the car without the Internet. (Sorry, my Kindle would not let me use the two syllable term that rhymes for the network.) I have the Lite version on my iPad and I love using the Pro on my Kindle Fire.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|the ends were too neatly tied up in the last second spilling of the secrets that life holds.<br />I wish the author or the editor had cut the epilogue completely.
B00124LYHQ|3.0|I watch a loot of old movies for a reason - I like them, and have been watching since I was a little kid. This was done in the style of the time, which makes it hard to watch at times due to the overly dramatic performances that tend to drag on and on. Worth watching? Yes.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|...the usual plaudits- a classic western...strong story, strong acting, esp. Jason Robards & Henry Fonda...great cine...classic showdown...what's not to like?
1250038820|5.0|I enjoyed this fabulous visit with different forms of humanity and hear what is motivating them in New York City,
B00513HXE2|4.0|The book set up Episode 1 but was a long read. Read it if you want to know what happened right before Episode 1.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is so fun you should totally get it. When you get this app it's worth it .GET IT
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Well crafted story. The suspense and characters keep one involved and intrigued.  A little too much violence for me though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's so fun I can't even stop playing it I am always on my tablet  i can't keep my hands off so I gab  this app 5 stars
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|This was my favorite, by far.  Loved the way he entwined the past with present.  The ending had me shed a tear. The<br />descriptions of Colorado and the mining were spot on.  Really, really great read,worth losing sleep over to read!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really like this game they should put all Zynga games on kindle. Love games with a challenge best one yet.
B00D7OMNXS|4.0|Continuing in the tradition of IM and IM2 there was lots of action  and a dislikeable bad guy.  Overall this is a great action adventure and sure to win the hearts of Iron Man fans everywhere.  I deducted 1 star for 2 reasons, 1: not enough Pepper Potts and 2: the over the top blowing up of the multitude of remote controlled IM suits for IMHO an ante climatic finally.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The &#34;Good Wife&#34; is a good person.  In the law practice where she works she is ethical, smart and willing to go above and beyond to help clients she feels deserve her expertise.  She is rational even when she is angry.  Each time I finish an episode I am eager to begin the next one.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|This is my favorite disney movie of all time. I have always loved this story, she didn't just blindly accept what she was told. She decided to find out for herself.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|A awesome platform shooter that has kept me playing until the very end. This is truly one of the best free games in the app store. The only two things that are missing are more levels and multiplayer. If you have storage space, get this app now.
B005FHXB0O|4.0|This was a great story. I'm always looking for films that both my husband and I can watch together. It can't be too romancy for him. I can't handle the wild shoot-em-ups.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Great story of such suffering during such a terrible time.  I found it difficult to get past the style/format used but once I did, the story took hold of me.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|I was a bit worried ordering this set based on previous reviews of quality.  However, I decided to go for it and, if necessary, return it.  No need.  The discs are fine.  No problems whatsoever.  I ordered the BluRay, FYI...
B007OLYQ4E|3.0|This is not quite your Audrey Hepburn version, but a very different story. Having only seen the movie, I was expecting to read that story but instead, you get a darker side to Holly and understand her a little better.
B0081336FO|5.0|This show is incredibly well written. It is a modern take on a classic, and Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are great in their roles.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Want weather accurate and up to the minute at a moments notice? Here you go. Nice looking interface and easy to use.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This was not my favorite read. The story seems too unbelievable, that Amy could get away with all she did and the cops  in the story are so clueless. Not really a believable story, though there are suspenseful parts.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I dnt have it but people say it cool so....yeah I let u people kno though so seya guys later
0385366450|5.0|I like all of John Grisham's books - mainly because they are clean worded, interesting, set in the South, and he is just a great author. You can always depend on his books to read &#34;like a newspaper&#34; - straight to the point, suspenseful, and hard to put down.  We are proud of Mr. Grisham in the South and I hope his book will be like all of the others - a big best-seller!!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|*The review WILL contain spoilers for Beautiful Creatures*<br /><br />I adored Beautiful Creatures, ADORED it and it’s hands down one of my top ten that I read in 2013(I know, I’m really late to the Castor Chronicles bandwagon :P ) so I don’t know why it took me so long to pick up Beautiful Darkness afterwards but I made it one of my goals to finish this series by the end of 2013!<br /><br />Beautiful Darkness begins at Macon’s funeral. This was heart wrenching in its own sentiment because I adored Macon in Beautiful Creatures and it shattered me that he died. I thought he was such a strong, loved and loving character that I couldn’t even imagine how the story would progress without him. I wanted to skip directly over his funeral but I did read it and good thing because you are introduced, or well given a glimpse into the creepy, horrific Incubus’s.<br /><br />Ethan and Lena were weird to me in the second book. While I still loved them, I felt like they were different from the characters I fell totally in love with in book one. Lena is deeply depressed, and bordering on Dark, because of Macon’s death and Ethan is like a love-sick puppy trailing around after her. I got really tired, fast, of this back and forth so because of it the novel really dragged onwards for the first while. Link, is still definitely one of my favorite characters and he plays a very large part in the second installment as does Ridley. I gathered in Beautiful Creatures that the reader is supposed to dislike Ridley but I loved her immediately and that did not go away in Beautiful Darkness. We are also introduced to a new character, Liv, who is here from England interning with Marian at the library.<br /><br />Once the initial slowness and the back and forth dissolved, the plot was really exciting. We get to see a lot more of the Castor world in Beautiful Darkness so that thrilled me. There are so many important things that happen and important people that we meet in Beautiful Darkness that it’s incredibly tough to write this review because if I was even to hint at certain things, I think it would ruin the effect of the story.<br /><br />I was very happy with where the story was taken and while the slow start, as well as Ethan and Lena’s flaws, didn’t have me head over heels for Beautiful Darkness, I really did end up loving the book and I am eager to read Beautiful Chaos. If you read the first book, and enjoyed it, you absolutely need to pick up this second book in the series… there are things that will shock you!
B00821OX98|1.0|Frankly, I hate this series.  I find that it is insensitive and cruel, almost more from the human stand point then the alien.  Hubby loves it but I won't watch it on a dare. leave the room for that hour or so...  And It is NOT for kids...
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|Everybody should get this app. It's the best! You will be amazed at how fun it is. (From an 8 year old boy.)
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has a heavenly voice.  She is very calming to listen to.  I fell in love with her on her television debut.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|beautiful graphics, good music,  engaging game,  fun to play.  Just get  used to starting over from square one again and  again as it randomly crashes again and again.  Heartbreaking the first few times,  but that's. the new Disney.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great movie.  My son likes Thor and  Locki.  I was pleasantly surprised that it kept my attention and I enjoyed it as much as the kids.  It has funny moments throughout the movie.  Recommend
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark, kinda gritty, very good, quick read. I liked the suspense building up to the who dunnit. And I heard this will be made into a movie; interested in how that'll turn out.
B00062PN6I|5.0|Really comfortable, nicely priced, good sound quality and they don't seem to crush my skull as some other muff type headphones sometimes seem to do.
B002361MLA|5.0|If you have a chance to take a class on this book you need too.  This book has so much potential in changing your life.  Each sentence is powerful and chalk full of mind opening lessons.  This is not an easy read book and you need to be in the mindset to read it.  Take it one passage at a time and meditate.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Great movie, great message. I'm glad the adaptation of the book was so well done. My 4 1/2 year old found it entertaining.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I have been looking for this movie every where for the last year. I finally decided to purchase it from Amazon. I thought it was a excellent movie totally worth the money. Came sealed in excellent shape didn't have any problems with skipping excellent purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My grandkids picked this game, say it gives them a lot of different games to choose from, and i like that
1932907009|4.0|Quite a good and easy to read book on the craft. Although, I'm not sold that it's an all-purpose guide for every story. It certainly has points worth considering.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Great Game<br /> My grandkids picked this. they like the cartoon so they figured they would try the game and they love it
B000JIHP88|5.0|My baby loves this mobile.  Every night she falls asleep to it.  To be fair, she seems just as happy with the cheap wind up ones but if you have to listen to music thru the monitor until the baby falls asllep this one is far superior.  The automatic shut off lasts for a long time so there is no sneaking back in to turn it off or using the remote that comes with the mobile.  A big bonus since sneaking into the baby's room only works about half the time without waking her up.<br /><br />She has loved this since she was two months old and doesn't seem to ever get tired of it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My grandkids chose this game, they seem to like it, they play it  alot, say it is fun, fun, fun
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|Anyone who compares this movie to the matrix is misleading you.  This is not groundbreaking movie making as was the case with the matrix, it is simply a bad remake of 1984 with guns.<br /><br />*THIS REVIEW IS NOTHING BUT SPOILERS --- BEWARE*<br /><br />OK, where to start.  In the beginning the movie shows plenty of 'emotion' police around, picking people from the crowd at random, for acting suspiciously.  But for the rest of the movie as Bale runs around hyped up on emotion no one stops him or anything.<br /><br />When he finds and saves the dog, his priestly partner does not automatically turn him in but simply accepts his lame excuse about disease verification, or whatever.  Also, how does he take care of this dog in the highly controlled society, and how does his daughter have the dog under her table in class, without anyone raising an eyebrow.<br /><br />Somehow, in the end, it is revealed that Bale has been setup, because they needed someone to infiltrate the resistance.  How did they know he would be the perfect candidate, when in fact he showed himself to be anything but.  I mean, he just shot his partner of several years in the face.<br /><br />Which brings me to the next point.  How could Emily Watson ever begin to forgive Bale for shooting her lover in the face?  I mean, so he now has the capacity to feel and somehow this is enough for her to just forget about the part where he shot her lover, and in fact begins to have feelings for Bale?!?<br /><br />Overall this is just a very badly made remake of 1984.  There is nothing new brought to the story and the fighting is pretty ridiculous.  Somehow the clerics have developed a fighting technique that allows you to fire more accurately while avoiding the common firing angles, or something to that effect, however, it seems like the cleric just sort of gyrates in place while everyone misses and they don't.  Not very convincingly portrayed.<br /><br />I would avoid this movie unless you truly have nothing else towatch.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like to play solitare so this game is a little more challenging and lots of fun. I play it a lot
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Ok as the title says this was not my favorite book in the series by any means. I loved the development of characters throughout the book thou but at most times is seed a little boring throughout. I guess this was necessary to develop this portion of the series. I was disappointed to not see many of the more interesting characters here of the further development of some, like Arya. I am a huge fan of this series and am looking forward to reading the next book as soon as it finishes downloading.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|All i can say about this book is HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE IT INTO A MOVIE!!!! it will be short, noy much they could put on the screen.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Very cool game graphics are nice hope it has some end gAme stuff!!! It's free to play which is always nice
B00367XA1K|5.0|Wonderful, creative presentation of historical fiction with a behind-the-scenes look at the players at an important time in history. You can learn from this film while enjoying a stunning cinematic experience.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Finely tuned phrases. I read and reread the vivid imagry. I smiled. I cried. I marveled at the beautiful telling.
B000784WMW|5.0|This is a wonderful version of the novel Jane Eyre. I first saw it on PBS, and have watched  it twicw since. It is that good, You could make it an annual treat. Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clare are superb,  and also the rest of the cast in their parts. Many of the plots in this are copied in modern novels, and serials. Charlotte Bronte really created a classic. Most highly reccommended.
B000068FWC|5.0|Iconic album from a decade full of them! Every track almost a classic now and so many that are rarely palyed anymore!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Trying to get this device to work cost me many hours of frustration, aggravation, and left me feeling less than kindly disposed towards Google.  The whole experience was nothing like the enjoyable and entertaining experience that I had been led to expect.  I put a lot of time in with Google tech support  on the phone and by email, I called my ISP provider, and my modem manufacturer, all to no avail.  The device would work flawlessly, then drop out.  Much of the time my laptop (running the Chrome browser) couldn't find the device on my home network, even though my TV would be displaying the Chromecast screen saying that it was on my home wi-fi network and ready to cast.  The same thing happened with my wife's laptop and her Motorola Razr Maxx smartphone.  After many reboots of the device, my Chrome browser, my laptop, my modem, etc., the problem remained; the device would work when it felt like it.  As far as I'm concerned, Google support is a joke.  I talked and corresponded with numerous techs, all to no avail.  It is more than a little frustrating to have to explain the problem over and over each time, and being asked to repeat the same steps over again, all while looking at my TV displaying the Chromecast ready to cast screen.  I have to say that the only functional part of the whole process was the Amazon return and refund process.  The low price is not a bargain when it leads to this kind of experience.  I'm not sure I would ever buy one of these again, even if they iron out the problems I experienced.  I already have a wireless connection between my laptop and my TV that works every time; I just can't cast a movie and use my laptop for other things at the same time.  Based on my experience, I would say that Chromecast is not a bargain, and was not ready for prime time.
B000068FWC|5.0|A classic that I would recommend to anyone!  A great listen for any age; my son is now a big Supertramp fan.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|Love it!  Finished both 1 &amp; 2,  still enjoy going back and playing the games again. Wish app wouldn't' lock up so often. I would have given 5 stars, but for it freezing me out.  I'd try to go back to replay a game and had to close it and wait for various lengths of time before I could begin playing again!  But it is challenging, fun, and addictive!  I highly recommend both part 1 and 2!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|found plot dragged some ....my guess that in following historic story line we knew what was going to happen ..character story lines should have bee mor dominate
0525951113|4.0|This is an impressive debut novel from this Author which, surprisingly for a first novel, is very well written and brought to mind some of the works of Michael Crichton. Readers who dislike graphic violence and sex, however, should look elsewhere as there is quite a bit of both in this novel.<br /><br />My problem with writing this review is where to start with the comments on character development. This novel has a large number of important characters included but is about a few central ones. This led to the main characters coming across as rather two-dimensional and very little time was given to their depth and back stories. The characters in the book seem to appear randomly throughout its pages and, for me this led to a feeling of it being a rather impersonal book. With that said however, this is a book that is extremely fast paced and this, in itself, may have led to the lack of development of any of the characters; almost as if the Author did not want to take time out from the action to give their readers characters they could connect to.<br /><br />When I say it is a fast paced book, I mean it. There is no downtime within its pages, no places where the reader can stop to take a breath and relax before the next event takes place. Unfortunately this means that in some places the plot moves so fast that it has a tendency to lose some of the details, but I had a feeling whilst reading this that this was an intentional move on the part of the Author; after all how many people feel that our real lives move at this kind of pace sometimes. The Author does an incredible job of bringing to the reader’s attention, if they were not already aware of it the fact of how much or our daily lives; both personal, business related and in the global economy that actually relies and is dependent on computer technology. After all without this technology there would be no book reviews from myself, and in this area this book can be the jumping point for some very interesting discussions for any book club that chose to read it. The Author makes the reader think and question their reliance on things that could vanish in an instant. It is this material and the Authors attention to detail that makes this novel stand out from the rest in the techno-thriller genre in my opinion.<br /><br />As with all good beginning to a series of books, this one does not have a complete and tied up ending, but it does lead very nicely into the sequel which not only leaves the reader wanting more but, from a marketing point of view, can only be a good move on the part of the Author and their Publisher. I will definitely be reading the sequel as I am intrigued to see how the plot plays out.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to lovers of the sci-fi/techno-thriller genre, and also those who like to read books that are well worth the time.<br /><br />Originally reviewed on: [...]ns for any book club that chose to read it.

B00F35B8F8|5.0|Very good movie. Non stop action. Even people who are not Star Trek fans will like this movie. Rent it or buy it. You will love it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is important to know that the game is tied in with Facebook because I can advance using both methods -- computer and book.  Since this is the case, the game is more enjoyable and handy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the Game but we need more objects we can buy with tokens and not real money .. I AM HOOKED
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Terrible.  I gave it 2 stars because I sat through the whole movie except for about 15 minutes during the first hour when I fell asleep.<br />The worst movie I've seen in a long time.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|You should be able to make your own minion. Like pick the type of hair the number of eyes along with the type of costume. I should prefer it with the changes.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|It's entertaining, so what more do you want.  It really did not live up to its concept - it could have been much better
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|It is good to get weather when and as needed.  I like it so far and will use it as needed .
B00G722T22|3.0|This album is better than Avril's past two albums but her music and style just hasn't been the same since her My Happy Ending album. As a long time Avril fan I'm glad that this album sounds and feels more like her first two albums. This album doesn't deliver the &#34;wow&#34; factor that I was hoping it would but it's definitely an improvement and a must have for Avril Lavigne fans!
B000001GQP|5.0|11-17-2013.  Withoutdoubt, this is, artistically, THE number 1 &#34;Carmina Burana&#34; on disc, past and present.  Why, well justgive a listen,actually, severallistenings, because you won't be able to stop  afater justone.  Secondly, and much more importantly, thios DGG 1969 reading was personallysupervised by the composer himself.  We are toldOrff communicated every requirement to Jochum, even the mostminute detail and, naturally, in German.  A SIMPLE BUT VITAL FACTOR.  ABSOLUTELY NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS.  CLASSICAL MUSIC NIRVANNA!!  SONICALLY,THIS CD IS ANOTHER MATTER.  THE ACUSTICS ARE GOOD, YES, AND SOMETIMES VERY GOOD,BUT WITH COMPETITION FROM, FOR INSTANCE TELARC'S SACD AND ROBERT SHAW a chorus' dream conductor,the audio effect could overwhelm you'r reasoning and one might think his is the better interpretation.  Oh, it IS super, I own it and love it.  But, for substance, style and execution and GETTING ITRIGHT, how can you beat Jochum and Orff hand-in-hand?  You cannot.  So, before I go further, my #1 reason for mypraise is the combination of energy, thrust and excitement Johum and Orff have given us that is the most outstandinbg feature of this performance.This is an orchestral/choral exstraviganza, full throttle,no letting up and loaded with edge-of-you'r-seatsound and ideas, wave after stunning wave.  Can't ask for much more than that.  It is almost as if we were the outgunned Poles of 1939 being inundated by a musical Wehrmarcht.  ( I hope the analogy, tongue in cheek, isn't offensive to anyone, if so, I apologize.)<br />  The famous &#34;o Fortuna&#34; opening chorus is almost my least favorite track on this recording, there are so many other magnificent cuts, this one almost bores me.(L.O.L.)  I never thought I would say that, when I first heard it on , guess what, a Jochum LP I bought in downtown Chicago's Rose records store.  I still own the disc, as a memento to myyouth.

0670024856|3.0|I had such high hopes for this book after reading many positive review on Amazon. The book started out wonderfully...and I found myself turning page after page in anticipation. Unfortunately, it slowed down in the middle and became tedious to read. I did like the botanical references and the concept behind &#34;the signature of all things.&#34; The book picked up at the end, but all in all if I had it to do over I could have better spent my time reading something else.
B00127RAJY|5.0|VERY fast shipping , I have not yet got the chance to really do the program yet, I tried it one time and I can definitely say it kicked my butt!! But the next morning I felt really good and firmer just from doing a few minutes of it , I will be trying again soon and hopefully able to finish this time haha I will update when I have the chance. :-)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely love it.  Totally addicting because every time you complete one level, it is a challenge to see how long it takes to complete the next one.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I enjoyed the story. Did feel a bit like Brad was not the best for the part. He didn't seem believable in the role.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Love Kay and her family and this does not disappoint.  Great read for a fall weekend and if you love  serial killers that get their due u will enjoy this current version. Keep them coming Patricia!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really had trouble putting the books down! I enjoyed them very much. A very good read. I could only stop when I had to sleep!
B004811PMO|3.0|After not seeing Oklahoma in decades it strikes me now as flawed because of the ballet/pantomime section in the middle of the musical. The ballet is fine in its own right, but it should have been offered as a follow-on or separate film or simply have been far shorter..
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I'm single, but this is such a good resource for families and friends too! It definitely helps relationships to know how to love them. This is a must read!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Comfortable read  no slam bang excitement  so grateful for having simply a good book to read as opposed to so many that are contrived and difficult to follow plots and themes.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I got the set as a gift for my boyfriend who is in the military and he loves this series. The case it comes in is very nice and the discs played fine, no issues.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This was a very sad saga of what happens in war.  It was a bit too long, but haunted my dreams during the period that I was reading it!  I don't think I will see the movie!  I have had enough sadness!
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Seen it so many times.  Love it!  A great line up of actors with a great story line.  I highly recommend it for a good laugh.

1932100660|5.0|The work done in THE CHINA STUDY brings home the role and importance of nutrition in our lives.  Balance is required to be healthy and our bodies have preferred percentage levels for the ingestion of meats (particularly red meat) and the rest emphasizing plants foods, minus the current sugar/sweetener intake generated by the introduction and proliferation of sugar cane and sugar beet products as the industry developed in the industrialized world.  The resultant side studies by the authors showed the influence of heavy consumption of sugars on the development of noxious growths of tumors, cancerous and benign.  The adverse influence of various levels of dairy product intake also came to light when elimination studies were conducted.  Our so-called civilized world has created processed foods with heavy money interests pushing ingestion of food products that are actually irritating to the human digestion system.  Reading THE CHINA STUDY raises a person's awareness that we are now creating our health crises right from the time of birth, vaccinations of infants now being the worst and most damaging.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|So many questions and theories all tied up as the plot twists and turns. Characters come to life with the details of their personalities. Excellent book!
1401938906|5.0|Easy to read, this book states universal principles in understandable language.  To understand the principles/precepts under review, Pam Grout has devised experiments to challenge the concepts presented that then also test a person's ability to stay focused to the instructions, thereby practicing reprogramming the thoughts a person entertains and shifting the energy field regarding what is being attracted into one's life.  Any exercise of this nature is helpful and the author has simplified the approach to get down to the nitty-gritty of changing your own thinking to break away from destructive or limited ideas that trap you into your own self-made prison or restrictive world.  The quotes from various authors are helpful reminder mantras (one liner type) to stating principles in a condensed format.  Everyone can utilize the practice(s) advocated that ultimately will help to alter attitudes to positive references to make life experiences flow with the help of the quantum energy field that is impersonal but still the source of life energy and surrounds us constantly.
0399157573|2.0|I was hoping that the trend that started a while back would stop and that P. Cornwell would give us a Scarpetta novel closer to what the books were when the serie started. And by that, I mean a solid crime novel, well written and with good characters.<br />Halas! Like the previous few Scarpettas, everything seems lost in Kay inner turmoil. It is less and less a crime novel and more and more a succession of thoughts, feelings, misgivings. It feels poorly structured, very repetitive and leaves an impression of utter mushiness. If the goal is to open a window on Kay's mind, I'm sorry to say that what's going on there is not interesting enough to make it a good read. Besides, because that also the direction the latest Scarpetta books have taken, it gives a very strong impression of &#34;been there! done that&#34; and kills all feeling of newness and discovery. It just drowns the story.<br />Please, P. Cornwell, go back to a more distant approach, where the story and plot are central, rather than the endless<br />dance of Kay more and more neurotic mind.
B000QE9ERK|4.0|Great story! Love Johnny Depp in these types of roles. The characters were nicely developed. Downloading was easy too with Prime membership.
B008KNUKVI|4.0|I'm not a fan of most modern popular music (hence my 4 star instead of 5 star rating). But what Pentatonix does with these songs is truly amazing. The individual vocals as well as the harmonies of this outstanding acappella group are top notch. And the clarity allowed me to finally understand most of the words to the songs! I first saw and heard them on &#34;The Sing Off&#34; a few years ago; a competition that they easily won. If there's a better vocal group out there, I'm unaware of them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is good for all ages and all skill level. I really enjoy being able to play it on my kindle.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Besides \\"Close Encounters . . \\" this is one of the few major movies about alien contact that treats both sides as optimistic, friendly beings. Well acted, exciting, and showing the complexity of emotions among the world's peoples that would actually happen should alien life be discovered. Based on the novel by noted astronomer Carl Segan, the movie faithfully translates the book to film with just a few minor changes and many positive embellishments. Jodie Foster is excellent as the central character: a well respected and ambitious young astronomer who leads the team that ultimately deciphers the alien clues and finally makes 'contact' with them. The film is further helped by a strong supporting cast and a very well written script. A must-see for all who believe that there is life \\"out there\\".
B000XUBFE2|3.0|Kind of  slow start but got better. Good ending to the story, but was kind of weird for me and took a while to get used to narrative
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Denzel works wonders with a third rate script. This movie has some very uncomfortable scenes as the plane losses control and heads toward earth. The story is not as good as some of the wonderful elements.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love Jake Briggance as I read a Time To Kill when it 1st came out. Both books were awesome! I love the crazy cast of characters and the ending was great. Read this book in 1 day. Was just going to start a few pages and ended on the couch because I could not get enough or put it down even while I was trying to cook dinner that night
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Don't be confused by the mega blockbuster Hollywood film. This book is basically an anthology chronicling a zombie apocalypse and not a story following one main character.  That being said the book is still the greatest piece of zombie fiction ever created. I'm not even sure how the movie can say its loosely based on the book for they only resemble each other in name and the fact that they are about zombies. I personally believe the book would have made an AMAZING miniseries with each part of the anthology making up an episode or two. So watch the movie first if you want it won't matter but DO NOT MISS OUT READ THIS BOOK IT IS THE BEST ZOMBIE BOOK EVER!!!!  Trust me I've read hundreds of books in this genre.
0452295548|5.0|An amazing book by a doctor who lost use of half of her brain through a stroke and worked her way back to full function. Tremendous insight into the workings of the brain.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|I'd give it a 5 but I haven't finished watching it yet. Just as good as the first 2 movies. I wasn't a Robert Downey Jr fan until the first Iron Man movie. Now, I've enjoyed all of his movies since.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Before reading this book I had already been gluten free for five years and experienced relief from the illness it was causing. Then several months ago after much research, I decided to eliminate all sugars and starches from my diet as well, as I felt that while there was a big improvement from being GF, there was more I could do to feel even better. This book pretty much puts together all the things I have read and researched and found to be helpful in my life. It verified to me that I am on the right track. Because we have been taught for so many years that low-fat diets are the answer to our health issues it's very hard to overcome that thinking even when my body has never felt better. As I read this book I kept saying to myself, I can testify to that! I have more energy, and less body aches than ever before and so far I have lost 17 lbs. The acid reflux that I experienced most of my life being treated with the usual meds with no relief, finally disappeared once I turned to a ketogenic diet. It was an immediate result that I never expected even before I lost any weight in doing this diet. I feel like my body is at peace with itself which makes me feel that if it's doing wonders for my body it must be helping my brain. I am recommending this book to all my friends and family.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great follow up movie. If you're a Star Trek fan or like space fantasy, you'll love it. I'm over 40 and feel the these two most recent Star Trek films rank in the best movies of my lifetime. Great casting for the movie characters. Lots of space destruction and funny cast lines. To those who didn't like this movie or the previous film, remember, this is a re-invention of the franchise with new CGI and special effects. The plot of the last movie did a reset for the future films. Anything goes in sci-fi space adventure. Hey, I didn't tell you that the ghost hunting and big foot shows were stupid just because I don't believe in them.
B003G4W49C|4.0|good read, interesting plot.  First time I read a Card book. Too bad the movie wasn't as good as the book.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Wow paying $35.00 for this you would think it would be of a decent size.Omg when I open the box up to see what a tiny piece of crap toy I received I was so disappointed and I know my 8 year old will be too when he opens this Christmas Day.I don't even want to give him this smh,it's price should have been $15.00.Never again will I buy Legos unless I go to the store I. Person and see what I am getting.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief took me into a world that little has been written about, the poor families of war time Germany.  They do what they have to do just to exist even with an arm raising salute  to Hitler when necessary.  The written style is  different and took a while to get used to but with death as the narrator and the mind processing  of the  young foster child, I was captivated.  It is a touching book that reaches into your being.

B0087ZG7NO|3.0|This is the second in the series of the Jurassic Park movies.  The visual effects and the dinosaurs are life like.  The movie is a roller coaster ride and I rather enjoyed it, mostly to see more Jurassic Park stuff.  Julianne Moore and Jeff Goldblum do well with what they have to work with.  This is where the negative comes in.  And this is surrounding the screenplay which is formulaic and manipulative.  Whoever wrote this script basically created far fetched and outlandish things to happen simply to turn this into a big chase monster movie.  Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching this for the way it looked and the tone.  My only complaint is in the story.<br /><br />For example, the screenwriter has the Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughan character steal a baby Tyrannosaurus Rex who is hurt so they can nurse it back to health.  Well any bright person who knows about dinosaurs as these characters allegedly should have, would know that the mother is going to come looking for it and will be very angry.  And that's what happens.  An attack staged by the screenwriter simply to shoot it in a mobile home dangling from a cliff.  This goes on forever.  The other manipulation was in creating a daughter for Jeff Goldblum who sneaks on the boat that's taking him to the island where these dinosaurs are.  Of course once she's there, she's kicking herself for doing that since dinosaurs are chasing them.  You hardly feel much sympathy for her or the other two characters that stole the Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Of course there is a corporation on the island with them so that this main guy can bring a T-rex to the states.  Then the Godzilla part of the monster movie begins.<br /><br />The most shocking thing about this film is that this is a film directed by Steven Spielberg.  He's a genius film director, but it baffles me that he thought this wasn't the least bit contrived.  He wanted to make a monster movie instead of really getting to know these dinosaurs and that's where his focus was for this.  Monsters.  Chasing.  Death.  We know less about the dinosaurs by the end of the second movie and more about movie manipulation.  Regardless of all that, this movie is watchable and well done with what they all had to work with.  I just wish there was more focus on creating a realistic story.s for this.  Monsters.  Chasing.  Death.  We know less about the dinosaurs by the end of the second movie and more about movie manipulation.  Regardless of all that, this movie is watchable and well done with what they all had to work with.  I just wish there was more focus on creating a realistic story.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love the Kindle App for android, and it works great on my Galaxy S3 mini phone, but on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 it crashes everytime I try to turn the page on magazine subscriptions I have downloaded.

B006IMY5ZU|4.0|Well acted and sports/baseball too boot!  Great view of cost cutting by Oakland A's to make ends meet and still sty competitive.  Just a touch melodramatic with daughter.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Not bad. I'm glad that I waited a year to read it, after all the hype about the book has died down.  I kind of liked it.  It wasn't what I expected it to be. I liked all the different variation of things that were going on. There were several things that I liked; one of my favorites were the e-mails. The back and forth witty banter and the changing of the subject.  I laughed at every single one.  It will be interesting to see if she can turn this all around and make it into a decent movie.
B00FQMZ5M0|5.0|A very meaningful and powerful movie. Everyone should watch this it sends a good message to live by for all ages.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Loved the witty e-mail banter back and forth.  Ana is starting to become more confident about herself and starting to step out on her own a little. I wasn't sure if it was this book or the Freed book, but at some point she started to get on my nerves; I just wanted to tell her to &#34;suck it up and get over it! Christian started to get on my nerves as well.  Who buys a company that their girlfriend is working at?  Oh yea, A guy who has nothing else to do with his money *lol*....I would have liked to have learned a little more about his business, but maybe that will happen in the last book.....All in all, it was pretty good. I'm glad it wasn't straight sex all the way through and that it started to pick up with some action.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like playing it and I fussed at my family and friends about playing this game all of the time. I would recommend this game for everyone. you will not get bored playing it will keep you entertained for hours
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is a big story--like reading a modern Charles Dickens--that poses the big questions.  Beautifully written.  And if you are fortunate enough to see the original painting, it is even better.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|When so many couples are willing to throw in the towel so quickly, this book allows you to own what it is that you are seeking as well as show in  you how to discover what your spouse needs to be happy. Great read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|ADDICTING GAME. I have this game on my phone and my kindle fire and i cant stop playing this game. this game makes me feel like i have an actual horse.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Edgy, dark, surprising, fast paced, thrilling, and funny, Orphan Black is by far my favorite show,  so to make the pleasure of this DVD set last as long as possible  we forced ourselves to watch just one episode a week. The twists and turns of the plot are gripping and actress Tatiana Maslany as the clones is amazing, giving each character unique mannerisms and quirks. Can't wait for the second season.
1401938906|5.0|Very informative read....I learned a lot about the thinking process and how we can really use our minds to create our everyday realities. I enjoyed this book!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great buy. I use it to stream all kinds of stuff to the tv. It was easy to install and to use.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Nice way to kill some time. I like to hunt and this game lets me hunt at work its a great game
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Gameplay is smoother, it hasn't crashed, and overall is more fun.  It does encourage buying crowns to quicken things, but so far it hasn't felt necessary to progress.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome get it. It is very challenging,you actually have to think and try. Candy crush sugar crush
0486268659|5.0|Marvelous classic, and reading the original reminded me of why the repeated movies and TV versions keep reappearing, as does the Christmas Past ghost. My teen age son wants to read it, and I hope the &#34;Dickens&#34; bug takes hold, and he wants to read more of those timeless classics of the human condition.
B0099114WO|1.0|very depressing - cute house though - you can get decor ideas from film if nothing else.... I would have dressed her differently...How did they afford all those Cold Water Creek clothes?
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Scalzi is always good, in my opinion, and this was funny and dramatic. I didn't know I was waiting for a story like this until I saw the title, and read the description. It did not disappoint.
B006O6F932|5.0|Daughter so loves this playset. Folds up nicely for easy storage. She's had this for 9 months and it is still a go-to toy when friends are over.
B00GINENG0|4.0|Awesome game because it's free and cool and really adorable and great to kids and adults if your really interested how the game is looker at or something you know so yeah
B000WCDBKM|3.0|Strange movie, truthfully really not into these types of movies but watched anyway due to Johnny Depp. It was intriguing.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good read. Another one of Grisham's intricate plots and not too formulaic, as were the Pelican Brief and The Jury, IMHO.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I am very disappointed that the calendar isn't supported on my Kindle fire hd.  Also, the calendar doesn't work in the silk browser.
B002361MJC|5.0|No BS, no propaganda. Not only is this whole foods plant based diet the answer to good health it also helps solve global warming.
B0013ND30W|4.0|Great movie, great sound, but menu layout, missing content from previous 2003 release, and some weird restoration hiccups make this less than perfect. I'm not going to get into the greatness of the movie since everyone knows already. My problems I have with it begins with the menu layout of the Blu-ray/DVD. If you compare the layout with the 2003 release, the new menu system is terrible. For the Blu-ray versions, it starts off with an animated picture of the castle. The weather changes randomly, and has a small menu showing, I think, different weather statuses for different Disney theme parks around the world? There's nothing telling you what this is and getting to the menu is confusing since the only thing that lights up letting you know the cursor got to the weather menu is a tiny triangle at the bottom. It then opens up a world map and lets you click on a location of a theme park, but nothing changes for the castle, making this completely pointless (by the way, my BD player is always connected to the internet). The real menu on the screen, that is for watching the movie, is small and basically pointless since one of the options is to open up a bigger version of the menu, in a different screen, where you can set-up the movie's audio and subtitles. The new screen for the bigger menu is very boring with not a lot of thought put into it compared to the menus of the 2003 release. The text for the menus is very small, including descriptions for each option. Unfortunately, this is the same for the second Blu-ray disc that houses that extra content. For the extra content itself, I think most of the content of the 2003 release was put on this release, but I noticed for at least the art gallery section, some drawings and other pieces that were included in the 2003 release, were not put on this release for some reason.<br />Lastly, the restoration is great for the most part but there are some weird changes made from the 2003 restoration. One change is very obvious; it's the scene where Maleficent crashes the christening. There is a close up of her laughing, but oddly, she has white eyes instead of the deep yellow eyes she always has in every other scene. In the 2003 restoration, her eyes are yellow, just like you would expect. Another example is the scene King Stefan and King Hubert celebrating the Aurora's return. The page that enters to show the future castle plans has always worn light green clothes. This new restoration changed his clothes to a yellow, which is fine, but before the page is put to sleep by the fairies' spell, his clothes are back to light green (then put to a dark green along with everything else). A third example is when Aurora becomes hypnotized by Maleficent's spell. The light shines on her and the background is green,  but her lighting has a different color or shade, making it look odd compared to the background's lighting. This isn't present in the 2003 release. Lastly, the brightness of the characters' colors are too bright to the point that you can't see a difference in hue, especially for their clothes. This appears to of happened due to the increased brightness they put when restoring every scene. I've only found one audio hiccup, it's the scene where the fairies are secretly planning on how to protect the princess from the curse. When Flora finally comes up with her plan, she waves her wand, tapping a ruby below. In the 2003 release, there is a distinct tapping sound done, but in this new release, the tapping sound is gone! What happened to it? Very weird, but hopefully the next release will correct all these mess-ups so that we can see the film as originally intended.scene where Maleficent crashes the christening.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a extremely addictive and fun game to play. I can now play it on my Kindle Fire!!!!<br />f
B006LSZECO|3.0|I finally got around to reading this. I wanted to wait until the hype died down before I dug in, so all of my thoughts and opinions would be unbiased.<br /><br />I think this is a good, but not great book. It’s well written, the characters are well developed, the plot is good, but what really makes the book is the structure. The first half of the book is told in first person narrative, alternating between Nick Dunne, the main male character in present time, and his wife, Amy’s (the titular character) diary entries for the last seven years. Amy has gone missing on her fifth wedding anniversary and all the clues (a fake crime scene, Nick’s outstanding credit card bills, Amy’s life insurance being increased shortly before her disappearance, Amy’s diary entries showing her increasing fear of Nick, etc.) point to Nick, her useless husband, who has a mistress. He seems guilty for sure.<br /><br />That is, until we get to the halfway point and we meet the real Amy, who takes over the narration from her diary entries. It turns out that she…<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />...puts the crazy bitch in crazy bitch and planned her disappearance over a year in advance after she catches Nick cheating on her and realized that she was mad as hell and wasn’t going to take it anymore, and her idea of not taking it in anymore is setting her cheating husband up for murder. She plans to stay away until he gets caught, which will most likely happen, thanks to all the “evidence” she planted, and then actually kill herself as a coup de grace to Nick.<br /><br />Things change after she sees Nick, “contrite” (he’s now playing her like she played him when she set him up for murder - he figured it out thanks to some clues she left behind), during an interview over the way he’s treated her over the years, she gets jumped and robbed by two rednecks at the cabin she’s hiding out in, and has to lean on a former lover by the name of Desi for help, who turns out to beextremely possessive and controlling. He treats her much the same way Nick felt Amy treated him.<br /><br />Another dramatic twist comes when Amy ends up going back to Nick, after killing Desi and framing him for her disappearance. Nick and she engage in a cold war after she comes back, with Amy winning after she finally allows herself to become pregnant with Nick’s child and he feels compelled to stay with her in a loveless, toxic marriage for the sake of his son.<br /><br />If all of that sounds confusing, it’s nothing compared to the book, where nothing is what it seems. I have to say this book serves as a nice counterbalance to the Fifty Shades of Grey series that came out last year. Where Grey was a supposedly dark look at an S&M relationship, but only turned out to be poorly written fan fiction basic love story with a little S&M thrown in as a hook, Gone Girl actually depicts an S&M relationship, where Amy & Nick take turns being the sadist and masochist. Unlike Ana & Christian, both characters are interesting and fleshed out and could actually be real people.<br /><br />What keeps me from loving this book is that it didn’t stay with me after I read it. I was easily able to put it down after I was done and I think it was because I didn’t become attached to any of the characters, although I doubt I was supposed to. It was fun to read Amy’s hilarious and insightful, not to mention batshit crazy inner thoughts, though.<br /><br />On one final note, I don’t see why so many people are complaining about Ben Affleck playing Nick. He has the look (handsome fratboy douche) and his natural personality, in my opinion, is very close to Nick’s, so he won’t even have to act (and he can act. Watch him in Hollywoodland. He’s amazing there.)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Susan Collin's Catching fire is an amazing book for teenagers.

B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Preston and Child are the number one authors and story tellers.  The book was so fast paced, interesting, and wonderful, I couldn't put it down and was extremely disappointed when it ended.  It had a lot of twists and turns and I couldn't figure out who the villain was until the very end.  Their inclusion of &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; was wonderful.  I'm looking forward to more books from them and can hardly wait.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|I liked the movie. My thoughts is the only way you can really like the movie for what it is, is try not to compare this latest version to the earlyer versions of Superman so much. I think the more you dwell on it being different than the other Superman movies the more that your going to find fault in it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a cute game, especially for free! I didn't think it would be all that much, but I was pleasantly surprised. The graphics are actually really nice, not flat or 1 dimensional at all.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|The only thing that ever bothers me about Langford is his inability to believe; especially with everything he's experienced first hand. I wonder if he'll be just as dense in Inferno. We'll see!
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|its a great game but it's way to short, you guys should add more levels to make it longer, thx
B009LXEBD4|4.0|The song  collection was really outstanding, Bravo Kelly. The service and description was accurate. Highly recommend. The catalog was better than anticipated.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I got hooked on ASOIAF initially by watching Game of Thrones on HBO, and eventually got so hooked on the storyline that I started reading the books just to know what happens next, as I was too impatient to wait for the next season of the show. My only regret is that I wasn't introduced to these books sooner. It is a great story and will go down as one of the greatest ever written, in my opinion. The world that George R.R. Martin has created is so rich and detailed, you can get lost in these books. I've spent a lot of days at work exhausted because I was up late the night before saying &#34;just one more page,&#34; as I read these. This set on Kindle is a good way to start reading this series. All the maps are here, and it is nice to be able to bookmark the map page to go back and reference if you occasionally get confused about where something is taking place. If you are a fan of the show, you definitely owe it to yourself to start reading the books, and if you haven't seen the show yet, just go ahead and read the books. The show is great, but there's no comparison to being able to read the thoughts and descriptions of such complex and interesting characters.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|I love the game but every time I continue a level it has a commercial and the adds in the corner make it hard to see u shouldn't have to pay for add free if you make millions anyways the adds drive me bonkers get rid of them!
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Great game all around!! :) graphics are great and hints are very useful! Keep up the awesome work!! One of the best!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Picked this one up as a recommendation and sooo glad that I did. Amazing story that inspires and reaches into your very soul.
8866137634|3.0|I picked this up as an alternate to my forever reliance on small-size lined notepads. First off, I hate the cover with its debossed icons. A plain cover would suffice and after paying $20+, I don't see the need to promote the company too. Yes, I can take picture for the Evernote app and it gives me a premium subscription to it, but not sure its worth it over the cost of a basic notepad. I've only snapped two pages, so far. The jury's still out if I'll make the switch permanently.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game but I do not like that I have to wait for my friends to give me tickets and I am too cheap to pay
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is very mutch like gta but not as good graphics as the actual game also in gang star<br />Rio you can explore like in gta
B006IGZWB2|3.0|I have only been able to see half of the movie, it has had some buffering snag each time I try it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played and  I can't explain how happy I am to have found it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really enjoy the game can't hunt in real life but I can in this game so it gives me a chance.really very vey
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Amazing album, loved the overall concept and balance between seriousness and fun. Katy outdid herself in this one. By far one of the best pop albums of the year.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Beautiful visuals and an interesting story. We bought it to try out our new 3-D projector, which wasn't nearly as spectacular as the real theater experience, but that has little to do with the media. Did I mention the beautiful visuals?
B00F91SCXC|2.0|What a pathetic cliche of a movie. Not the quality you would expect from Brad Pit. Absolutely preposterous plot and boring screenplay.
0060853972|5.0|Great tale dreamed up and well-told by two master craftsmen. Sounds like mostly Pratchett, though it's been a long time since I read it (this was a lend-to-friends copy I ordered to replace the last one I lent). Lots of droll Briitish humor, so do be sure that's your cup of tea (with milk and sugar).
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Wow, a great movie. Very under rated by the &#34;experts&#34;.  Twists and turns at every corner. The cast is amazing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun to play.  I get so excited when I clear a level and move on to the next level.  I also like that it has a lot of levels to play.
B00BWQW73E|3.0|Overall, I liked this book and I was excited to read it. I felt myself wanting more details though, and I'm sure that the author's access to Amazon people was good but probably not great. That feels like the difference between a truly insightful book. He starts out the book talking about a &#34;narrative fallacy&#34; but I think he let some of the chapters devolve to the easy/pedestrian story about certain events. Again, I think access helps. Maybe the right time to write this book will be in another 10 years. Amazon feels like it's still just getting going.
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|I haven't had a chance to use this app.  So I do not think it is fair to rate it but I had to give it a couple stars in order to write something.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|OMG so bad. So many elements that have made the Superman story so enduring are missing. I am actually pissed off.
B000002U9L|5.0|Who can love the movie and not adore the soundtrack??? Some songs go beyond the movie (Chilly Down - As the World Falls Down) but they're all great.
B002M9FWQE|5.0|I have other Mika cds and this is my favorite. It's got great songs and words. I play it when I'm exercising or walking. Great happy music
B00GIZO674|5.0|Really like this game. Different than most time management games. I especially like the sound effects. The shunk sound is satisfying. The flick option enables your fingers to keep up with your brain's quick task stacking that these games require. No ads so far. Graphics good. Looks like a lot of levels to get through. Haven't seen the other playing modes yet but I appreciate that option being on the horizon for longevity and value.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|The songs were better in concert, the cd was flat or something. I heard their concert on TV so I know it's not an equipment issue - bad tv speakers, bad cell phone speakers. Still good songs.
B008EKOIN8|4.0|Book has some fabulous insights for any one who even slightly likes to cook but I felt the style of writing heavy handed and it just was too long.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Works well, build quality is OK, but the output level is much lower than all my other mics with a preamp built in.  Makes mixer adjustments a real pain.
B000L212HC|5.0|A great movie!  Two of my favorite actors and the movie is full of twists and turns that keeps you on your toes till the VERY end.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book will knock out just about any excuse you may have for not moving forward with your life.  The examples of failures help you to realize that one of the most important things is to just keep learning from your mistakes.
B004FHCH96|5.0|Truly a great movie!  I would highly recommend everyone to watch this at least once.  It is very well done.
B005DOKL3E|4.0|This was a gift for my wife's birthday to protect her Kindle Fire. I think I got more than my moneys worth.
B000I186FW|5.0|Truly a great movie!  I do not believe it did the best in reviews, but I highly recommend you checking it out at least once to judge for yourself!!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|One of the most interesting and well written books I have read. I recommend it highly. I have told all my friends about it.
B003HARV4S|5.0|A very good movie!  This is a classic for me and a must have for any true movie fan out there!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like it!!!!! I was so excited to see Amazon had added to the game apps! &quot;Addicting&quot; to say the least.
B00AEBB8BA|5.0|Such a great action movie!  This is a really good movie!  There are great actors and the story line was done very well!
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great movie! We really enjoyed the plot twists and the surprise ending. Great story, great characters, great dialogue. You don't need to have seen the first movie to enjoy this one, but I did enjoy seeing the characters as younger versions of themselves.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|As I advanced in the game, it became too much for my older pc's memory, so I stopped playing. I'd love to have something like this for Farmville too!
1451688091|5.0|Arrived in great condition and just in time to watch the &#34;Lincoln&#34; movie!  Fascinating life and times of Lincoln.  But he struggled with winning people over just as much as we see now, it is just that only the good accomplishments are remembered in history.
0307743721|5.0|The Dear Life Stories came on time and in great condition.  This is not always the case in AK.  Thank you.
B004132HZS|5.0|Got hooked on these and eagerly awaiting Season Three to hit the US!  A friend told me about this series and takes a bit of getting used to the characters but watch several episodes to see their characters unfold and you get attached to them.
B000005GWE|5.0|I love this album, it's a guitar players dream.  Everyone is in top form and a delight to listen to interact.  So break out your axe and join the party.  It doesn't get much better than this!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Fantastic game much better than the money version I would recommend this to both boxing and robot fans only change I would make is add a more customization
B000035P5E|1.0|This is possibly the worst transfer of an exciting spy/espionage thriller I have seen. Fancy transferring this 1.85:1 movie in a non anamorphic ratio. When enlarged to its proper size/ratio, the grain in this film looks more like mice running across the screen than the usual ant look. I have a PAL copy and if this is ever produced in a Blu-ray version, my DVD copy will be a great frizbee.<br />MGM, you are a disgrace to the profession.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|nifty way to quickly find your closest theatre and movies for a qick evening decision out or just to review available flicks
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|This is a great movie that educates you about captured killer whales and their behavior. It was directed very well. Everyone should watch it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy this game alot.  just challenging enough.  want more levels though.  hope update comes very soon.  not much else to say really.  okay then.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|In a Southern town, Clanton, MS, in the 1980s, still fighting its racist past, an old white man, facing a certain death from cancer, hangs himself.  The next day, a letter arrives in the office of a Jake Brigance, lawyer, who we last saw in the &#34;A Time for a Kill&#34;.  In the envelope, is a new will from the deceased man.  The will leaves none of his wealth to his kids, and most to his black caretaker.  So starts the story of a town soon to be ripped apart by an explosive trial as to who should inherit the wealth of a Seth Hubbard.<br /><br />Another of John Grisham's page turners, not in the sense that it's full of action, but the characters are rich.  The title of the book and the overall theme carries it to the end.  Some of it is predictable, but the last few chapters make sense out of the whole journey.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I am an OLD eagles fan and have been since the 70's.  It is good to know more about these talented guys.  I wouldn't/couldn't spend the money for tickets when they came to Memphis But I could buy this !!  And it will last longer and I can watch as many times as I like!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm thankful to have discovered the book long before the movie released. I found it by accident, really. Somewhere I read some horrible excerpts of a deviant man's political opinions and it was mentioned that he was a writer. So I chose the most popular book and read it.<br /><br />OSC may have some insane personal beliefs, but he can put such meaningful feeling and thought into fiction that I couldn't put it down. Each book after is good but this is the best.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin's characters are addictive.  They live in my reverie with those from Ondaatje's The English Patient as well rounded, conflicted, ironic personalities with whom I love to talk in the quiet times when driving long distances across the American midwest. They keep me company when ever boredom threatens and liven the atmosphere continuously.
0553284347|5.0|This book was amazing. I recommend it even if you don't think your parents did any wrong. This book is an eye-opener, and it helps adults understand why they have problems in their life, even when they've moved out and away from their parents. Highly recommended to EVERYONE.
1476727651|5.0|I've never been a huge reader of Stephen King novels, I have read a couple of his other books but I'm more into non-fiction, Philosophy & true crime. I found this such a great read, I could barely put it down. I finished it in a week. It's opened the door for me to now get into more of his older works. It's very descriptive and kept me interested the entire time. I highly recommend if this type of fiction is your thing or you are already a fan of his works or if you're looking for something new. This wasn't exactly gory or anything, it's weird & strange but overall just a very interesting story.
B005LAIISA|5.0|One of the best of this series! Granny is hilarious! My niece was so happy to find this in her stocking last Christmas and we loved watching it with her! Good for all ages!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I think when this was first written it would have been a little too sci fi for my tastes. Trying to wrap my head around the technology in the book that wasn't invented then, but now is. Or at least depicted on a regular basis in movies and media.  Thank goodness the internet came true and going into zero gravity became more frequent and shown or it might have been harder to get a good mental picture. Amazing what almost 30 years can do. Definitely hard to put down once you're in a few chapters. Am considering buying the next in the series in hopes that it will be as entertaining
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Perfect for the whole family! We loved this movie series! My niece was so happy to find it in her stocking!
B000002GXS|4.0|Love his lyrics.  New Coat of Paint is a favorite song.  I am going to purchase more of his music because of this cd.
076790592X|5.0|This is an excellent book! Life's lessons in the best form! I recommend this book to anyone. Absolutely would read again, and I need to do just that!
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|Movie was really good, my wife decided it only gets 4 stars because I failed to purchase the rental in HD.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Ms. Tartt has gifted her readers with a long-awaited 3rd novel that absorbs the attention and captures the imagination as thoroughly as any novel should.  The character of Boris, by itself, is worth meeting for its nuanced ambiguity and sheer fun.  This is a book to savor on a grey November day, or any other day.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|Fine, but not up to the original trilogy. It is OK, but do not have the magnetism and passion Matt Daemon and Franka Potente gave to the first movies
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I have a Samsung galaxy s3 mini and I downloaded this app not knowing that it wouldn't work, couldn't even open it but according to the reviews it seems to work on kindle.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|Brun Mars music is great; I love his voice and the music is perfect. I would have given it 5 star rating except for the graphic language. I knew it was r rated when buying it, but be careful when & where you play it. Still, I love Bruno and will continue to buy all of his albums.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Totally worth it. It kinda reminds me of subway surfers and temple run in one game! Maby that's why it's so fun.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I love the fact that this is a testimonial to his life put into music. Rod knows his audience and knows how to play to them.Yes, the words are printed so you can follow along and not misinterpret any of it.
006202406X|1.0|This was terrible.  I hate how weak she made her characters.  The plot is not believable, and the ending was the worst.  I loved the first two books.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This movie was the best movie I ever saw, and it is time to fight and time to run and run.<br /><br />(Written by my granddaughter.)
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I was disappointed in the end.  I think it could have been a great book if it had been edited more tightly.  This happens to may authors whose first books are much applauded.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very habit forming. You just can't put it down and walk away until you conquer that last level.....then you say...&#34;Just one more&#34;....which is never enough!

0767812387|5.0|One of the best romantic stories I've ever seen.  Watched it every evening for 2 weeks straight.  Will not tire of this movie for years.
B008MWBY6W|1.0|The construction is very poor.  After a short time the stitching began to unravel and the case is coming apart.  I was very impressed with the design and functionality when I got it, but unfortunately it is coming apart.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I read this book last year because i had read all of the harry potter books in 4th grade so i had run out of good fantasy books. I started reading it at a football game and I read it all in two days. I was frantic to find the Sea of Monsters becaue The lightning theif was sooo good! I must say, all of his books have sparked a love of Greek mythology. The way he makes the gods and goddess seem modern is just great. Cant wait much longer for Blood of Olympus!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|I do like the theory behind it, I even don't mind the light tone throughout the book, but some examples given are just a little bit insulting to me as a reader as they have little or no substance. Say for example, her friend hurts her ankle, she says to her ankle (not her exact words) to stop swelling and all of a sudden, just like that ankle settles down and she never even had to see a doctor about it.  I already know that what Pam tries to communicate throughout the book to be true as I've seen it all for myself over the years but sometimes she makes things sound too simplistic and silly.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham tells another tale that is gripping from the first sentence.  Courtroom drama and human frailty blended so perfectly.  The ending is unexpected and breathtaking.  Loved this book.  Another vintage Grisham success.
B002AOWXQ8|3.0|Mu husband likes this group. I got him this CD for Christmas. Guess he wants some more of this groups to listen to.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was very disappointed with book 3 of the divergent trilogy. I love book 1 and 2! The idea behind book 3 is good but the execution was terrible and the end kind of ruined the whole trilogy for me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Puzzler for sure. Sometimes tough to get to the next level but usually makes sense after you solve it. I have killed plenty of time trying to get through. Not terribly exciting but a good puzzler for sure.
0887431461|4.0|I love this work book. My son goes to Kindergarten and this book complements what he does there very nicely. He actually enjoys doing it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun! Levels get so hard as you move up. Easy for kids but challenging enough for adults.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I heard so much about this game, I was really looking forward to playing it. Don't get me wrong, it is fun---when you can play it. The limit of 5 lives is annoying. Much more annoying and, I feel devious, it the fact it keeps asking for you to BUY for real cash money more lives, bonus items, and even levels!!! I have since found many other match 3 games that DO NOT require payment and are really free to purchase. I would have happily paid for the app to play the game WITHOUT all the sneaky bids for money. As it is, I now only play this game a little.

His work helps the reader to understand what drives motivation in the 21st century, a critical factor for all organizations and individuals, especially those in positions of leadership.
B008JFUORW|1.0|Give me a break!!  If I hear the &#34;f&#34; word ONE MORE TIME I think I am going to croak!! Is that what they think makes a comedy these days??  Between this film and &#34;The Heat&#34;  I have had a lifetime full of foul language. And their point is.....????? If this is where comedies are headed I'm about ready to start watching reruns of &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; and &#34;Laugh In&#34;!!! Come on Hollywood, you can do better than this!

B00D8CSVLW|5.0|It was well written and edited and delivered a gripping, suspenseful story throughout. I great winter's night read. Highly recommended.
B00GINENG0|4.0|This game is awesome.<br />talking tom but your taking care of him. Trust me you should get this game cuz it's also free.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|First off I like superman stuff and I love big motion pictures like this which is why I am so baffled by this movie and the producers.  They act like to cut anything out was some sort of blasphemous act and should never be done.  By the time you get to the end of the introduction ( if you can call it that ), the movie wasted a whopping 30-40 minutes.  Now I am of the belief that an intro should be about 15 min. And then you get on with the movie, but 40 min.? Who decided to pick this editor?  So finally we get to then real start of the movie and it starts to drag on and on and on and on as though no one was paying attention to what the story line was.  Which btw what the hell was the story line anyway? THis movie took so long that my internet went out. And I was happy to be able to go to bed w/o having to finish it.  The question is, did my internet go out from the movie being so long, or was it due to the fact the movie IS so boring?  Unfortunately my internet will come back on and I'll have to watch the rest of it.  Can't wait! NOT!<br /><br />Edit:  So I finished watching the movie and it got even worse.  The plot is so weak it is nearly absent.  And all these people that say the graphics are great obviously love cartoons because the graphics were exactly that.  If movies are going to go to this extreme to make action scenes \\"realistic\\" then I guess overtime I will watch action/adventure movies less and less.  I was appalled at the fight scenes when they would turn into cartoons.  No thanks.  I hated this movie and wish I hadn't spent the $4.99 to rent it.  If I could give it zero stars I would.  What a waste of money.  To think I could have gotten a Big Mac instead.
B00FM8WGK2|3.0|Not as cute as hoped she would be.Her hair is just a pony tail it looked like more to me.Her pants also fit in an odd way.I do love Jinafire and her face is beautiful so all in all a good buy.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really love this game but come on Amazon update the game! My rating is staying four stars until they update the game.
B006X415GK|5.0|This is a special MH she is so different.I wish they would put out a few more black and white styles.Very retro.As cute ae original Torilei who is still crazy priced.I hope Mattel floods market and the crazy 40 tr old male Toralei sellers can keep theirs
B00BI489P0|1.0|I was very disappointed with the Kindle edition of this book. It cost $2 but there was nothing about it to warrant the price. Usually when public domain books cost money, it is because the compilers have put effort into making the edition very accessible and aesthetically pleasing. Not so with *The Complete Works of William Shakespeare*. The volume did not even have a table of contents! Since Shakespeare was a prolific author, this makes the book prohibitively difficult to navigate on the Kindle. The reason I bought this book was because I wanted to read *Henry V*, and I thought that I might as well purchase the Complete Works since I am likely to read many of Shakespeare's plays in time. This book is so difficult to navigate that I ended up downloading the free version of *Henry V* by itself to read! Don't make the mistake I did and purchase this edition. You will be better off downloading the various plays individually.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|She is super cute and so is her dust bunnie,we all own a few of them I think.Beautiful colors and her shoes are great .I even would like a second Twyla to wash and restyle her hair and change her clothes.A must have for the MH collector or any one you like a cute doll.
0670026557|5.0|Grant provides a lot of data to support his conclusions, which are both welcome and surprising, and I found his reasoning compelling as well.<br /><br />If you consider yourself at least something of an altruist, I think this book really provides a blueprint on how one can succeed in both life and business without getting burned out or discouraged. If your instinct is to help others succeed, this book will help you avoid being exploited by &#34;takers&#34; that would turn your efforts toward brotherhood into their personal profits. Contrary to some intuition, there are ways to achieve personal success (both financial and emotional) without having to check your empathy at the door, without having to demand a profit on every transaction, and in fact learning to do it &#34;right&#34; can increase the amount of help you can provide enormously.<br /><br />I was inspired by this book.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|GREAT GAME! It puts Candy Crush to shame. Great being able to play without having a certain amount of tries and then being told you have to purchase more swaps or having to wait until you can start again. Great graphics too. I highly recommend this game.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Large simple design graphics lets you know at a glance the percent of charge . There really isn't anything to do but load the app it does all the work  simple.
0399157573|5.0|Cornwell is a Master Storyteller. DUST is as good as it gets. The characters engaging, the plot riveting, this powerful and gripping novel will keep you glued to every page.<br />If you love a good crime novel, treat yourself to this book. DUST is truly one of Cornwell's best!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Although there are limited apps for the device, I've been very impressed by the easy set up and easy use of the device.  A great device idea to use with your laptop, tables, and phones.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was taken in by Liesel and felt compassion for her throughout the whole book. Normally I can't read books or watch  movies related to the holocaust, but this was slightly removed from the it. I have to say that reading a book with &#34;death&#34; as the narrator was very different. Liesel's relationships were emotional, and I'm a sucker for that kind of story. You had to wonder how this could have any kind of &#34;happy &#34; ending. I wont spoil it, but it was bittersweet.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I thought it was a good book; however it was hard to follow all the different sub plots. I didn't think the author finished explaining all of the sub plots.
B0064W67IM|5.0|I was relatively late in getting into this series but i am so glad i did.  Very nice series and look forward to the next 11 volumes.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Very challenging but easy.  Keeps you thinking.  I would recommend this game everyone<br />I don't have anything else to say about it
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game until about level 30. Then it wants you to pay for almost everything. Otherwise very  addicting and fun.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Creative and well written. The episodes I have watched have had interesting plots, with imaginative cocclusions. I recommend watching this series.
B0053TMP24|5.0|So kind of the same plot as the first.Honestly this one is way better.There is way more action in this. I love this book a lot.You find out more about this other camp. Your gonna love it. I couldn't stop reading it after the first page. Audio isn't that bad as everyone says .I just prefer the other narrator Jesse Bernstein.

B00ECR7KX2|4.0|It take me close to twenty minutes to start to enjoy &#34;Much Ado About Nothing.&#34;  At first, I was annoyed that it was black and white, that the play has been transplanted into modern-day Los Angeles, and that the characters were talking gibberish.<br /><br />But at the end of the day Joss Whedon's ironic humor, Amy Acker's portrayal of the witty and whimsical Beatrice, and the war of the sexes between Beatrice and Benedict won me over.  Any film adaptation of a Shakespeare play is difficult, especially his comedies -- and it's a tribute to Whedon's versatility and brilliance as a director that &#34;Much Ado about Nothing&#34; does in fact work as a film.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a favorite of mine and my sister and I love it it is like a great fairy came and went to work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ella is my name.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book gives you plenty to think about in your career and family choices. At times I was equally convicted and inspired. Great read for all women no matter their career choice.
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|Mud, an outlaw character comes out to be the \\"good guy\\" in the movie in which he misguides two teen age boys into activities that are devious, dishonest and against the law to achieve his end; in the end his earlier murder of a man who mistreats his fantacy lover he is hunted down by family and a gang of revenge bound men who close in on the home of one of the teen age boys, whom Mud visits in his escape from the law and those looking for him, when the gang of men open fire on a private residence, attempting to kill innocent people in order to kill Mud.  In the end, several people are shot dead, Mud escapes and makes his way out of the area, leaving everyone thinking that he was shot and killed.  In this movie, Mud fails to live up to the expectation of a moral character of an adult person, gets away with murder, and misdirects two teenage boys to disregard the moral conduct needed in a society of responsible people.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|Sure, it only plays some Gameloft games.  But these are the best games.  Pairs fast.  Had two 10 hour flights across half the globe and this console made the time go by quick.  Like having an xbox on board.  Console controls most functions with great response.<br /><br />Unfortunately I did not baby it traveling around and the fire button broke.  At the very reasonable price amazon offers this product it is a no brainier purchase.  I will baby the next one and maybe bring two for the next big trip.  Would give it a 5 star but the button did break.  However, it did go through a bunch of travel jostling.
1589795474|4.0|A good read, though it seemed to inspire me in the opposite direction. Though we need to save to spend, don't obsess on saving at the expense of missing your life. Begin with the end in mind to understand how much wealth you need to create - the, if you can afford it, buy the boat, buy the car, buy the cottage, but only if you can afford it. To model your wealth after reading this book, try @ [...] - it gives a good 360 on your own wealth creation. You may find a fortune!

1471304965|3.0|I got part way through this CD and I started thinking of all the stuff, good and bad, that I wanted to say on amazon about this novel on CD.  Then I realized that this was a heavily abridged if attractive multi-voice production, and my review wouldn't make much sense.  I'll save my extended review for an unabridged CD version, if such exists.  As it is, this is one really pricey selection for maybe 2 to 3 hours of listening.<br />Heavy spoiler alert going forward.  So what to say here?  I don't know how much this CD is going to make sense to somebody who hasn't read the book.  It's a nice reminder to those of us who read the actual, considerably lengthier novel 30+ years ago.  Part mystery novel about the author - what did he do to get his brain zapped so long ago - how did he recover from that - what happened to his family in the meantime?  Part story of father/son issues.  Part philosophical discussion (the part I like least).  On the one hand I'd like to say that this man's past sacrificed for his message to the rest of us.  But a larger part of me says this guy is bonkers regardless of the message.  Maybe both are right.  I find a lot of the philosophical stuff mumbo jumbo.  I find a lot else objectionable in the actual book, but it is memorable and thought-provoking just the same.  I had no trouble remembering specific incidents from this book which I read 1978-ish in confirming how abridged this CD was, which says something about something.  So at the minimum it's memorable.
B000FA675C|5.0|Edge of your seat reading with enough twists and turns to get your heat pounding. I read this book long before Tom Hanks became the professor. Dan Brown knows how to spin a tale of intrigue no matter how implausible the premise.
B003V4ASV8|5.0|this novel offered an excellent insight into a little known culture. well written. more pics could have been included of the subjects of the stories, however.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Good actors, well acted, not too dumb. My lady enjoyed it too. The final fight scene was the one bad part. It could have been totally left out.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|It was okay ... I purchased it because we own everything Star Trek and wanted to complete the set.  Perhaps with the passage if time I will not be so stuck on the &#34;old&#34; Star Trek and will view it in a different light.  It seemed more like a movie made from comic book heroes than Star Trek.
0385523394|3.0|The NetFlix series is infinitely better!  The characters are so riveting on the series, less so in the book.  Both my husband and I were disappointed in the book but love the series.
B007Q476KU|4.0|I liked it :) but for me it's not the most remarkable film in the world, it's not one that really cemented itself in my heart like some have, I'm not really sure why. I'm glad I rented it, but I don't know that it will make its way into my list of DVD must-haves. Also a warning to any &#34;softies&#34; or even kind-of softies - it may have cute horsies, but remember that this is a war movie. It may not be Saving Private Ryan, but it definitely gets pretty heavy, and has its fair share of brutal and tragic moments. Not a negative point to me, it's WAR after all, but just saying, be prepared for it. keep the tissues handy.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I loved this book and wanted it to never end. I especially loved the part that took place in Las Vegas. What an amazing time.  I also felt that by the end of the book, I started to think about art in a different way, as a part of life that stood above it and was timeless. I realized it  could play a part in my life, like the painting played in the life of Theo.<br /><br />The author is an exceptional talent. I also loved Freedom, by Jonathan Franzen in a similar way.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|That is easily the best Superman Movie ever!! Lots of action, and great story line. A lot of great actors in this one as well. Didnt care for the death at the end, but I could see why it happens that way.
098555780X|4.0|Nicely illustrated and easy to follow patterns. It's important to read through the glossary to get familiar with the terms and directions. And of course it takes practice with a little trial and error, but as you progress they get easier to follow and your ties begin to look more and more like those illustrated. Watching the youtube videos is helpful also, as your are learning.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|Clever writing and hilarious bungling kept me reading; however, never got over the death of Mark Darcy. After two novels of single Bridget, which we finally overcame at the end of novel no. two, was not ready to go back into the dating world with her. Despite being more than a decade older, Bridget has not matured. Novel could have been just as funny and socially insightful with Bridget struggling with (and deliciously failing at) the daily challenges of wife- and motherhood.

B008G12ERC|2.0|I thought that I'd really like this album but their songs all sort of merge together and sound the same.  I like 'Black Holes...' and 'Origin of Symmetry' a lot.  This not so much.  Took it off my iPhone.
B008JEJOAG|5.0|Nice grey color with lime green soles!  Great to throw on for walking dogs or working in the yard, etc.  Love my Crocs--ordered this pair to replace the last pair which finally started to wear out on the soles!  Get some!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is great fun and the game I enjoy playing just to pass the time when I have to wait on someone.
B00EI4V3X2|5.0|Works great for the PS4. I just wish that the cord between the headset and controller wasn't required. I suppose once Bluetooth is fully patched in for PS4 it will be even better! The quality is good overall though.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|the best CD made in years.Katy still has that youthful party sound but adds some flavor of maturity which makes this a benchmark album.I don't think I will ever want to see a Vegas style showcase act from Katy.but she will definitely continue to keep a fun and happy pop oriented style.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved it! very well written, surprising and life altering. I loved it. It is a simple story, but there is a lot to be learned.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I used this eye-opening movie to get across the repercussions of living in a fantasy to a chronic liar.  It was not the cure but it opened the door to self-examination and made them realize they are the only one living in that fantasy.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This calculator app is the most user friendly one I've ever tried.  It is easy and fast, and saves  calculations until you're ready to clear them so you can review them.  I recommend this to anyone who wants one on their phone.
1476727651|3.0|Mediocre, I've been a huge fan of king for almost twenty years. This story was mediocre at best and I think king knew that, that's why he decided to write it as a sequel to the shinning. Knowing it wouldn't hold its own.
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|I simply wasn't moved in the least by this reboot.  In fact, of all the reboots I think this was least deserving, primarily due to its overuse and abuse of ample amounts of CGI.  I was hoping they would attempt to explain how Superman manages to take flight.  How does he achieve propulsion?  I don't know, and obviously the filmmaker doesn't either.  The worst of the movie was the last thirty minutes that was replete with an abundance of CGI stunts that undermined any and all notions that any of the Kryptonians could die from anything other than old age.<br /><br />I think this movie would have been MUCH better served if it chose to reduce the reliance on CGI and water-down the stunts to be a little more realistic.  If not, how can one ever sympathize with Superman?  He obviously can't be scratched.  I know he's superhuman, but come on, there needs to be some vulnerability.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What a great story. It was difficult to put down . The characters were excellent, and the writing was amazing.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|The time-shift scenes make it seem you can predict what's going to happen...not so! I love the writing and acting, very compelling series.
0767811070|5.0|I love this movie. It just feels si real. Outstanding actors portraying a realistic scenes of how it would be. Akthough it nay not ve exact,i feel there is a lot of truth im this killer film. Very well written, and a must to see, and i am not a movie person
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was first introduced to this book by a friend of mine. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down, a true masterpiece!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fantastic! I always wanted to own a real horse but never could. This is the next best thing. Only wish I could actually BE there to care for it. If you LOVE horses, get this now. You won't be sorry.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Amazon Sucks, I could not watch the movie, it was all choppy then I could not even get to it it said it is not in my movies and yet they billed me, Very frustrating 1/2 hour trying to watch a movie.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Loved the main characters.  The art world was fascinating to me.  The friendship between the two guys was both endearing and sad.  Loved how the deception was dealt with. Good , good book
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game! Just downloaded this last night and am addicted already.. Great graphics and I love how they really incorporate the movie storyline. More importantly you can get ahead and really enjoy the game without having to spend money on in game purchases.
B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|Solomon Northup was a real person with a wife and children doing well as a talented musician living in New York in 1841. He is tricked into being kidnapped, and then is chained, beaten, broken down, re-named (now called \\"Platt\\"), transported and sold into slavery in Louisiana. Northrup is one of the very few people to have escaped this terrible plight and, eventually, return to his home and family.<br /><br />This story is primarily about those 12 years a slave from the book Northup later wrote detailing the transition from free man to slave, the shocking living conditions and treatment of slaves in the south, and his own ordeal in the hands of three slave owners within a system of institutionalized captivity and abuse. His account provides a rare and incredible historic insight. The film is gritty, raw, real and details exactly how slavery \\"worked\\" in this country, including the many lines of defense to prevent escape, the extreme measures to deny freedoms, the ways slaves survived and did not, and the ill effects on  the people committing or allowing such atrocities.<br /><br />Torture and violence are set against an often beautiful scenic background, a physical example of the many contrasts presented in this film. The characters are complex and many insights into that time in history are revealed as well as eternal truths about human nature, cruelty and kindness, survival and courage. In this beautifully shot, masterfully crafted film, the main actor Chiwetel Ejiofor makes you desperately feel each and every emotion Solomon experiences from a carefree stroll with his wife and children in New York all the way through his horrific ordeal until his reunion with his family 12 years later. Won't be surprised to see this one sweep the Academy awards and gain recognition as a best film of all times.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Loved it. I'd not studied this particular generation of Tudors and found it fascinating and well written. As with all Ms. Gregory's work, I would highly recommend it.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|awesome movie. better than the first one.  My son loved it and watched it multiple times over the 3 day rental period.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The crossfire series is my favorite ever. This is my 3rd read of all 3 books! Yes! I am that obsessed! Can't wait for the forging and fifth book. MUST READDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
B00E6D4HHO|4.0|I have to say for person that already has one is a liar (unless you are a Fox executive) because I work at the company that packages this product.  We have it setup to package 11-17-13 for the first run it will not include the \\"Days from future past but it will include a open slot I the last digi-pak for collectors to add it to the collection. The actual claw is a hard plastic the background supporting it is metal. It is a beautiful collectors edition. The discs are all special edition for the collection all new screen print and version that is only made for this set. I WANT ONE!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome<br />Amazing and shout bart Stupak to get out of the dead island survival of the dead island trailer for
B008NMT684|5.0|Love it my son plays with it all the time is good for learning and matching and helps with my son delays
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|This season is really, really good, full of surprises and intensity. I gave it the four stars because ofthe excellent story arch with Carol, the return and development of a certain villain, and a gigantic herd of undead that dwarfs anything I've seen in a zombie flick since Romero's opening sequence for Day of the Dead.<br /><br />However, it doesn't get 5 stars for the simple reason that TWD is starting to suffer from pacing issues with some of it's stories.  A mystery began at the opening of Episode 2 isn't resolved until after episode 7 and it's something that almost gets major characters killed before we even know how or why.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|I was looking for slot of weather apps and this one was the only good one. I'm glad I got it because it tells you the temperature and what the sky is going to be like and you don't have to have the app on, you just have to have your kindle on. Plus this app is FREE! Which is even better .
B006N0YWGY|5.0|this is a fun game, had it on android phone, switched back to i phone , glad i found it on here, love it
B00E3IZIM0|3.0|It's a great movie for the inner 9 year old. Action scenes are amazing and are a blast to sit back and watch. However, they try to through a love story into it and towards the end you're just questioning how anything makes sense.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Great sharpener and highly recommend it. It should bea standard item in everyones toolbox. Buy it you wont be sorry.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Sometimes it was difficult to know what character you were reading about because their name changes throughout the story.  Towards the end, it all fell together and the story was well worth the read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome. It is highly addictive and has very beautiful graphics. It is appropriate for most ages young or old
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so ecstatic that I can play this game on my kindle fire!!! Best app out their so addicted.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|This is so fun to play wish there were more missions other than that it is so fun to play
B000YGIIPO|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It is a children's book, but funny and interesting. Maurice is clever and funny. Well worth reading.
1400052181|4.0|VERY INFORMATIVE READING,I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.It MAKES A GOOD GIFT FOR PEOPLE WHO ENJOYS READING.
B00BAXFDLM|4.0|I had never heard of Ancillary Justice or Ann Leckie before about two weeks ago. If not for it being the November Sword & Laser pick, I may not have read it. I would have been missing out.<br /><br />This one was slow to grab me. The protagonist does not have one point of view but many. How you ask? Well it's a sentient ship made up of hundreds of mobile units referred to as Ancillaries. Just what is an ancillary exactly? It's not exactly clear at the start so, you'll have to read to find out.<br /><br />I'm not very well read in Sci-Fi, so I don't know if this concept of Ancillaries is new or derivative of previous works, but it felt very unique to me. It was hard to get accustomed to at first.<br /><br />The sudden swap of perspectives on the same scene can be quite jarring and confusing. As I'm only a solitary unit, and not a shared collective I don't think well that way.<br /><br />I don't recall if this is the time I've read a book with an artificial intelligence as the protagonist, but the fact that I can't certainly shows it's something unusual for me. I think Ms. Lackie does a good job with it. It certainly doesn't feel human to me, but that doesn't make it uninteresting.<br /><br />I don't tend to spend a lot of time thinking about the books I'm reading while I'm reading them. I've seen/read far to many Movies/TV/Books over the years that when I do, it can ruin the experience for me. I tend to just &#34;sit back and enjoy the ride&#34; as it were and saving the thinking for when I'm done. This one was hard to do that though. There was a lot going on, I couldn't help but wonder and theorize.<br /><br />My only real complaint about this one is it takes too long for you to know what exactly is going on. The story alternates chapters between past and present until meeting somewhere in the middle and you finally have things click into place. I can see this turning people away from the book and missing out.<br /><br />There are just too many books out there competing for everyone's attention and it's too easy to put down something that doesn't grab you right away. Overall though, I really enjoyed this one and will be waiting for the next book in the series to come out.
B00CATSONE|3.0|This book is not as much about Nikola Tesla as it is about the type of man he was.  Not what I expected.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|This was good and the recipient liked it as well.<br />Carla Bruni's Little Fr Songs got a good review in the Times was was terrible!!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|The sound effects are so cute and I love how many coasters there are! I would definitely recommend  this to anyone!!
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This wonderful and everyday whimsical perspectives of the imperfect in book form is perfection for enchanting the soul and swooning a romantics heart in oh so many profound and touching ways. If it sounds like I loved the reading of The Rosie Project, then I am absolutely guilty of feeling self indulgent and good about myself for pampering the arousal zones of my brain for around ten hours over a three day delightful period of sporadic, leisure reading with an uplifting pattern of good craziness in chapter after chapter of rapid fire oddities with life lessons galore in the bargain. It's the same kind of warm and touching oogles I got from reading Garth Steins, The Art of Racing in the Rain, minus logical and practical assumptions and conclusions. So here's an Amber (sort of...) Alert for the romantics of the world who want something different which is totally addictive and captivating contagious. For a heartwarming fix comparable to a delightful Australian tea party where this romance takes shape and location, rosie up your life a bit with this reading project. Life is to short not to squeeze in a look at love which has no practicalities or bounds. The kind that just happens and brings joy when you least expect it. Thanks, Beginner of the Beguine... After enjoying the author, Simsion,  take on Rosie, she sure made a splash like a Cole Porter song...
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Easy to play and keeps the game moving. The objectives give enough rewards so you don't have a lot of down time.
B00881VLCE|5.0|My granddaughter loves this app. It keeps her busy and HAPPY..I'm so glad she found it. Tis is really great.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. I personally love horses so automatically I liked this game. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! You get to interact with the horse, love it!!!!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This app is almost useless.  The radar feature rarely loads and if it finally does load there is no information visible.  This app was installed on a Kindle Fire 7 HD...  Goodbye Weather Channel...
B007EC27QM|5.0|Use it every day. Good looking and easy to use.  Many more features than the stock calculator. Great for mobile use, big fingers have no problems anymore .
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Enjoyed the character development and the unpredictable plot line.  Definitely looking forward to reading the next installment.  Good pacing and mix of action and human interaction.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John and Kate with a great supporting cast.  Great story, but a bit &#34;windy&#34; in some parts.  All in all, well worth a read.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I read this as part of a book club, and those of us who are more into hiking enjoyed it more than others. There is a fair amount of detailed hiking/backpacking information, and if that is of no interest to you, you may not be able to wade through it. The personal story of the author's attempts to 'find' herself during her 100 day solo trek on the Pacific Crest Trail has some moments that are very moving and insightful. But there isn't a big epiphany moment to tie it all together, so the ending is a bit of a letdown. Of course, this is real life, not a novel, so things don't always get tied into a neat bow, but the change in the author at the end of her hike isn't quite pronounced enough to make you feel like you've really been on a personal journey with her. That being said, because I am a hiker, and do like stories of personal transformation, I did enjoy this book and would recommend it to anyone with similar tastes.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Akin to a middle school essay written the night before it is due.  Actually just a come on to buy a full book.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|I was looking forward to spending some time with Bridget again, but unfortunately this book disappointed me. As is well known by now, the author made the difficult choice of having Bridget now widowed and a solo mom at 50 with 2 young children. That has limited comic appeal for me, and for many prospective readers of this book I expect. While the book begins with Bridget 4 years out from Mark's death, and ready to move on, because I was just learning of it, I felt like I spent the first half of the book in mourning myself! Bridget may have been ready to date again, but I wasn't ready for her too! So that was the big issue with this book for me.<br /><br />However, getting past that, there are some funny moments related to parenting and the new world of social-networked dating. So if you can get past the widowhood and single motherhood, and are ready for middle-aged dating jokes, you may enjoy this.
0670020745|2.0|I was very disappointed by this book.  I was not looking for information on cause and effect of strokes, there are better sources.  As a stroke victim myself I was interested in some insight from a doctor/ patient point of view.  Meandering into new age ramblings is where it went. Some may like it, it wasn't what I expected.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Nice closure to the series. Several unexpected twists and turns.  I shared the book with my teenage daughter and we had fun with it.
B00881VLCE|1.0|crashed regularly and had issues starting which was highly annoying. Also not very good at knowing which piece you were trying to pick up and move.
0132350882|4.0|Remember to keep things simple!  While some points seemed obvious, overall the book served its purpose in allowing our team to write better code.  One point that we adhere to without question:  Every method must do 1 thing well and only 1 thing.  No method should be the jack of all trades.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The tale was sophomoric and trite.  The writing style unpolished!  I was bored!  Nearly did not finish -  The author might benefit from reading &#34;The Story of O&#34; by Pauline Reage.
0140067477|5.0|No need for some of the &#34;heavier&#34; books out there!  The Tao of Pooh is a quick and simple read about eastern philosophy that anyone will be able to understand.  How do you view life?
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|I should note that I only made it 3/4 of the way through.<br /><br />Reasons why I don't love this:<br />(1) The plot is too silly.  It is based during WWII, but it isn't historically accurate.  I wish the writers either simply made the story pure fantasy or did a better job making it seem like this is something that possibly happened during WWII.<br />(2) I'm not a huge fan of Captain America.  The super hero concept seems to be based on the guy  everyone knows who goes to the gym a lot.<br /><br />It's not horrible I suppose.  I'm sure most kids like it.
B000FC12C8|4.0|It's amazing to see how topics that were covered in 1949 by Graham are still relevant today.  Very cut and dry, but a definite read that has earned a spot in my library of books.  A great reference for all!
B00BAXFECK|2.0|i have never written a review before but am an avid reader and enjoyed the secret history so had high hopes for this. i am so disappointed. the protagonist is unlikeable and shallow and the story is too. i did stick with it in the hope it would improve and i am a fast reader but it only deteriorated. do not waste precious relaxation time on this.
B006R4H5FG|4.0|A lot of good ideas for presenting.  Presentation Zen looks into preparing, designing, and delivery of the presentation.  While there appeared to be some redundancy, this book had some great points.  It's all about balance!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|PLAYED PLENTY OF GAMES ON NINTENDO, WII,PS,ETC.....  THIS GAME ONE OF THE BEST!  Plenty of variety.  Not impossible, but still work to master each board.  ENJOY!
B000VZMQD8|5.0|Even though Mariannne F sounds like she smokes the razor blades she gets in her apple on Halloween.  Her best song.INHO.
1451666179|5.0|9 pages in, I was laughing so hard I cried. I love that each section is color coded, so I can find my place really easily. The drawings and the stories are hilarious, and definitely worth the read! I love Allie Brosh's blog, and am so pleased that her book was equally good and hilarious. I feel like Allie and I could have been best friends, I feel like she's telling stories about me... and that's probably why it's so funny, because she's really easy to relate to, and really down to earth.<br /><br />If you want a fun book, something maybe to stick on the back of the toilet for some light reading... this book is fabulous! Also a great gift idea for someone with an awesome sense of humor.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I liked it all. I recommend it to everyone. You get to see a be brave at the end. She says no!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie, real action, all in one picture .  Clean streaming in HD without process issues.  Budget pricing making the purchase worth the cost.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Kindle has finally gotten on board with CCS!  I love playing it wherever I go and it runs smoothly.  Woo hop!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is great.  Loved the movie.  I love to watch when it is cold and snowing outside.  Great acting.  So happy I got it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|As the last book in the series everything must be resolved. Roth's ending is both shattering and unexpected. Something that all writers hope to achieve with there work. I found myself grieving for a character in a book as I would for a person I loved. Awesome book.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|After years of hearing stereo versions and bootlegs of mono recordings, these official mono discs are a revelation. Not every mono version is preferable to stereo, but plenty are. This is a must buy for fans.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|As with any series that is worthy of reading each book reveals more about its characters. You find yourself craving that information in an almost desperate way. Marten captures you with nonstop action and adventure. I only wish he can complete the story before I die.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I really should have read the description of the book before buying it. This is the worst perversion of science I have ever encountered. The experiments don't prove anything. The evidence for made up theories is of course anecdotal.<br />This sentence from the book pretty much sums it up: &#34;Likewise, if you're not getting the answers you want, that's not the field of potentiality's fault. It's you that's screwing up the principle.&#34;<br />If it didn't work, it's your fault.
006202406X|2.0|I am sitting here shaking my head. I have never seen a more outrageous build-up and a horrendous let-down in the publishing cycle of a book. It was like an ADD riddled spider that worked too hard to close the massive holes in its web that it fell off in exhaustion and got stomped on until it was a gooey mess. Really? REALLY? I waited for this!?!?!
