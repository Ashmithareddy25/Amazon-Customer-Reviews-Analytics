B0036S4C6G|5.0|I read a lot of books, at least one a week. I can't remember finishing a book and then immediately starting to read it again, but that is what I did with this book. And I enjoyed the 2nd read even more than the first. A very unique book, and certainly entertaining.

B000001FMX|5.0|The New York Dolls were truly ahead of their time. The band fused the best of American music with an outlandish image that was too dangerous for the American masses in 1973. This album is one of the best debuts ever recorded and is better than 99% of the albums recorded by the punk and glam metal bands that they influenced. David Johansen is charisma personified and the band's performances feel like that of a train running at breakneck speed threatening to fall off the tracks but never does. The first three tracks are all wicked rockers as \\"Personality Crisis\\" combines a fast pace with some tasty piano work and driving guitar lines while \\"Looking For A Kiss\\" and \\"Vietnamese Baby\\" are all attitude and catchy as sin. \\"Lonely Planet Boy\\" takes it down as Johansen's vocals are nearly a whisper and find a great balance with the acoustic guitars and `50s style R&B horns. From this point, it's all rock n' roll that bounces between swaggering riff rockers (\\"Jet Boy\\", \\"Private World\\"), tunes that recall the early days of rock albeit with a lot more guts (\\"Trash\\", \\"Pills\\", \\"Subway Train\\"), and a track dedicated to Frankenstein that is more ferocious than the monster ever was. This is also one of several great albums produced by Todd Rundgren who just let the band play, not reining them in at all. All told, this is a classic even if it didn't make the band superstars. Highly recommended.

B0058S0OMS|4.0|Universal missed just a bit on this release. Dont get me wrong, its a good one but it could have been great. The 30th anniversary title is a bit misleading. There is not a heavy amount of extras on the disc. The picture and sound transfer is touchy in spots. My wife and I both watched it togeather and noticed a lot of white pops on the negitave. Im not sure what sorce universal used for the transfer but it could have been better. Look its a catalog title I know, and this will probably be the only release for this movie on blu ray but universal could have took their time on this one. Now what the disc does include is the terror in the aisles feature movie that has only been realsed on vhs in the past. This is aside from the film, the real jem on the disc. Still for what its worth it is a good price and  slight upgrade from both the goodtimes and universal dvds. Dont miss out on picking up this one it might go out of print fast. I hope that universal takes more care with halloween 3 when it hits blu ray. Enjoy!

B0058UXHHK|5.0|I had the pleasure of meeting the author recently and had to read the book, as we both live in the same city. I was uncertain about the book before I purchased it, but was easily hooked within the first 10 pages. The story of Rose's adventures in just a couple weeks was exciting and mysterious...I couldn't put the book down. I found myself reading until the wee hours of the morning because I couldn't wait to see what Rose was going to get herself into next. I'm looking forward to reading more books from the author and would recommend this one to everyone! 10 stars!!!!!
B0018D4SHY|4.0|4.5 stars.  A classic.  A few weeks ago, the refrain \\"The Girl Can't Help It\\" popped in my head unbidden, and lingered.  I thought:  Why not find out its source?  With the Internet, Google, Amazon and Wikipedia, you can find information with little effort.  So, Little Richard.  Yeah, I kind of remember him.  When I sampled the songs on the website, most were familiar from my pre-adolescent days.  They are also rife with double entendre, a sophisticated form of wit that has been largely displaced by the contemporary single entendre.  Although I am far from expert in pop music history, I now classify Dick Clark (Rock Around the Clock), Little Richard, Buddy Holly and Jerry Lee Lewis as the forefathers of Rock.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game harkens back to the 2-d Final Fantasy games of yore.  Gameplay is reminiscent of FFV as you equip different \\"tablets\\" to learn skills and passive bonuses.  Combat is satisfying and I like how the battles are not random and can be avoided with some skill if you are trying to make it through an area.  Combat is your typical turn based affair.  Boss fights are challenging enough that you can't auto-attack through them. Dungeons are not overly grueling but are somewhat predictable as far as pacing goes since they are all about the same length.  Great game - if you enjoyed any classic RPG this will be hit with you.
0470449748|4.0|This book is full of questions... that's the point.  It is exactly what it purports to be and is GREAT practice.  I would combine this with the Manhattan set of strategy/problem guides and do the relevant questions after learning what the Manhattans teach.  This particular book doesn't go in as much depth with any of the stuff you need to learn for the GMAT, but has LOTS of questions.

B005DZMP00|4.0|If you're thinking about buying this and you don't already have the original Europe '72, stop what you're doing and go buy that.  That said, this is a great companion to that classic album. Sound quality is excellent (a previous reviewer said it was only OK, which I frankly just don't understand at all). Obviously the band is firing on all cylinders throughout this entire tour.  The tune selection is great - there's no repeats from the original. However, it is true that the packaging stinks (there basically is none of it).  Previous reviewers have said that Dark Star -> The Other One is the highlight -- which I understand, it's a great version -- but I actually got more thrills from some of the more inconspicuous tunes: Loser, Deal and Dire Wolf are all gems. And Greatest Story Ever Told was a minor revelation for me: I was so used to the mediocre 80's versions that I had completely wrote it off, but to hear it get the Europe '72 treatment opened up my ears again...
B0041JMT82|5.0|Buy this book. It is well organized, the patterns are beautifully photographed, and paired with well described instructions and very readable charts. This book delivers so much more than expected. The intro deals with flatness issues, problem solving, joining, color combinations.  The book touches on designing your own motifs, with the circular graphs for square, triangular, hexagonal, and pentagonal work in the appendix. A good book for people of all skill levels, from utter beginner to well experienced. If I could give it a six star rating, I would.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is a great film I enjoy watching it at least once a year. I suggest it as a family viewing as the fight scenes can be too violent for children.
B004BSFSTA|4.0|the first thing i noticed about these headphones is that they are quite small. not a bad thing but some of you may be thinking they are big headphones which they are not. the ear cushion has a nice feel, (dont think its leather though)  but if you plan on using these for extended periods of listening i wouldnt recommend them because your ears will be uncomfortable and start to hurt after about two hours of use. now the sound quality is good. everything is clear and these headphones can go really loud! also really like the cord because its tangle free. but before you buy these headphones take into account one thing, these headphones Are Not actually made by Marshall! they are made by a company called \\"zound industries\\"  Pros: great sound, nice look and feel, tangle free cord  Cons: hurt your ears after some time, not actually made by Marshall :(
B000P0J0AG|5.0|In Heat director Michael Mann gives us something quite extraordinary. This is a crime-film with a literate and articulate script which is character and plot driven. There's a fair amount of action, but Mann blends elements of film-noir and thriller into a subtle drama with many memorable moments and beautiful gritty cinematography.<br /><br />When professional thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) and his crew (Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, and Danny Trejo) hi-jack an armored car, their extra hand, Waingro (Kevin Gage), impulsively opens fire, elevating their crime from robbery to a triple homicide in broad daylight. The case is taken by veteran cop Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), a driven Los Angeles detective, with a failing marriage, who moves swiftly to piece together the minimal evidence and pursue the thieves.<br /><br />McCauley soon realizes that their murders in the armored car robbery have brought additional \\"heat\\" on them, complicating their next major score, a twelve million dollar bank heist. McCauley and his partners play a cat and mouse game with the police and decide to attempt the bank robbery in spite of the ongoing investigation of their activities.<br /><br />Most films of this type concentrate on fast paced action set-pieces, impressive car chases, and clever dialogue. Not that I'm opposed to such things, but, while Heat contains your recommended daily dose of violence, the director, keeps the relationships and people in clear focus. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue sharp, and everyone in the cast turns in strong realistic performances. Pacino, as the colorful and mercurial Hanna, and, De Niro, as the deadpan and ruthlessly efficient McCauley, in particular, are perfectly matched and play off each other well.<br /><br />I don't think a review of this film would be complete without mentioning Dante Spinotti's beautiful and effective cinematography or Elliot Goldenthal's infectious and understated score. This is one of my favorite movies.I could watch it over and over again.
B0058VW36U|5.0|They have really thought this one out.  Starts out easy and gets progressively more complex.  But still very playable without being frustrating (as I sometimes find Angry Birds).
B0055S348W|4.0|Love the app, but for some reason it stopped letting me print my Google spreadsheets. I can print a pdf file and contacts and everything else.

B004WOJ9E8|5.0|Symphony X; the Gods of Progressive Rock/Metal have returned.  This time around, we have been blessed with the arival of an album of truly epic proportions.  That album?  Iconoclast.  I will admit, upon first listen of this album, there was a part of me that didn't like it.  Then, I gave it another shot and truly listened.  This is not Paradise Lost 2, this is Iconoclast, the SX version o what will surely be the downfall of our human society.  So, without further ado, here is my track-by-track review of \\"Iconoclast.\\"  1. Iconoclast - This is how to begin an album.  That typical haunting and dark sound of Symphony X, that builds then punches you right in the face!  Everything on this track works.  The guitars, drums, bass, all very heavy; yet they don't drown out the vocals of Allen.  The harmonies are perfect here, and the break in the middle with the epic guitar solo with the choir, ah that's the trademark of these guys.  Very, very good beginning to wet our appetite for what is to come.  5/5  2. The End of Innocence - Not stopping for anything, track two starts hard, heavy, and again right in your face.  There is a bit more of the classical undertones here which gel so well with the solid guitar plying.  Allen's vocals here are incredible and truly show why h is one of the best in the world.  One of my favorite songs overall; just amazing.  5/5  3. Dehumanized - Here was a song that initially turned me off.  The track is very heavy and hard-hitting, but for me I couldn't initially get into how the vocals were arrainged throughout the song.  Upon listening more, I can see it works very well as Allen has more of the growl and deeper impact over the heavy layers of the guitars and bass.  Great song theme-wise as it really brings the listeners into full swing.  4.5/5  4. Bastards of the Machine - Again, this was a song I was initially turned off by.  The guitar work here is absolutely superb.  Gels very solid with the heavy and endless drums.  However, Allen's vocalstoo me just didn't mesh.  Upon further listening, I find it does work well however I still feel there is something a little off with this track.  As I listened, I feel it is simply the fact that there may be too much going on on this one track.  While heavy, and intense overall, there are elements that seem to get lost in the shuffle.  4/5  5. Heretic - Here is a song that is heavy all the way through, and everything seems to work in harmony with everything else.  Amazing guitars, heavy drums, and deep, dark, broading vocals.  What makes it so good is the small elements of the classical music underneath the heaviness.  Heretic is a solid rocker off the album.  4.5/5  6. Children of a Faceless God - This is a song that seems to have everything wrapped into one.  If you liked \\"Paradise Lost\\" if you liked \\"V\\" and if you liked \\"Divine Wings...\\" this song is one that wraps all of it together.  I LOVE the guitar work on this track.  Each member of the band seemed to have brought their A-game here; just an amazing track.  5/5  7. Electric Messiah - Again, hard hitting, in your face, and fast.  This seesm to be the song that sums up the theme of the album as a whole.  Very, very intense guitar work here; and Allen seems to pour every emotion into the vocal arraigment.  Very solid tune, fits extremely well.  4.5/5  8. Prometheus (I Am Alive) - I LOVE this track.  To me again, it seems to have every element that we fans have come to know and love about the band.  Heavy riffs, solid bass, and killer vocals.  This to me is a hidden gem on the album and really one that brings the theme into a close from the heavy and dark concept.  Amazing.  5/5  9. When All Is Lost - I won't lie, when I first heard this song, I didn't like it.  To me it just didn't fit with the rest of the album.  The rest of the album was so raw, dark, and heavy that this song just seemed very, very out of place.  Recently though, as I listen further I can see that it is really a song thst brings the album toa solid close.  With the rest of it being so heavy, Allen's vocals along with the piano are a sort of calm release.  Telling the listener that this journey is coming to a close, and to understand the dependence we all have on technology; which is too much.  A very solid tune that again shows us all that Allen can sing with the best of them.  4.5/5  There you have it, \\"Icooclast.\\"  For any and all fans of Symphony X this is a must have!
B001AW156U|2.0|When I got them, I really liked these. They gave the PS3 controller that feel it needed. However, less than a month after buying them, the one I had on my R2 broke. I glue it back together and switched them around. Then the other one broke about a week later. I guess its not a big deal since they are cheap,,But I didn't play that many games that heavily used the R2 button, so I don't know how well they could hold up from even a single heavy playing session

0393064476|3.0|The thesis and tone of The Swerve echo Jacob Burckhardt's now somewhat discredited 19th century characterization of the Italian Renaissance with its celebrations of life and beauty as a \\"return to paganism\\" (as though the Middle Ages didn't have its festivals and gai savoir). Burckhardt's book may be outdated as history but is nevertheless a masterpiece of Romantic historiography that repays rereading. Greenblatt is no Burckhardt, but it sounds like his book will also be valuable - even only insofar as it is successful in familiarizing contemporary readers with the role of characters like the colorful Poggio Bracciolini, Lorenzo Valla and their manuscript-hunting Humanist confreres, many of whom were employees, like Poggio himself, of the Papal court.  Greenblatt seriously overstates the role of Lucretius, whose influence, until the mid to late 18th century was arguably quite marginal. Peter Gay's The Enlightenment: The Rise of Modern Paganism, unfortunately not mentioned by Greenblatt, deals at length with the influence of Lucretius on French Enlightenment thinkers, many of whom really were \\"pagans\\", i.e., materialists and epicureans. The standard view, of course, is that a revival of Platonic idealism, not of \\"pagan\\" materialism, was responsible for the Renaissance preoccupation with beauty and harmony.  Poggio's fifteenth century discovery of the manuscript of Lucretius's De rerum natura was not commented on much by Renaissance humanists, who confined themselves to remarks about Lucretius's grammar and syntax. It was printed in 1511 with a commentary by Denys Lambin, who termed Lucretius's Epicurean ideas \\"fanciful, absurd, and opposed to Christianity\\" -- and Lambin's preface remained standard until the nineteenth century. Epicurus's unacceptable doctrine that pleasure was the highest good, writes Jill Kraye, \\"ensured the unpopularity of his philosophy\\". See Jill Kraye's  \\"Philologists and Philosophers\\" in the Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism [1996], p. 153-154.  If Renaissance Humanists such as Valla and Erasmus seemed to paradoxically endorse Epicureanism, it was in a Christianized and Platonized form in which love of God and life of virtue were seen as the highest pleasures. They certainly did not endorse Lucretius's materialism and they probably didn't even see the significance of his belief in atoms. Montaigne in his Essays, on the other hand, quotes Lucretius repeatedly, often without attribution, indicating that Lucretius's naturalism, if not his Epicureanism, was appealing to him.   In The Swerve, Greenblatt describes the fascinating 1989 identification of Montaigne's personal annotated copy of Lucretius. Greenblatt also cites Pietro Redondi's controversial portrayal of Gallileo as a closet materialist, while gliding hurriedly over the many objections that have been raised to Redondi's assertions. As a liberal and believer in science, myself, I fully sympathize with Greenblatt's predilections. He is a lively writer, but I think the public would have been better served by more balanced presentations, such as can be found, for example, in the writings of Anthony Grafton, who is especially good on humanism during transitional period between the Renaissance and the French Enlightenment. Grafton also traces the interrelationship of humanism and modern liberal ideas in a way that is attractive and convincing.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app does what it is supposed to do perfectly. It is completely customizable, which is what makes it so useful to me. I work 4 days a week, and I am able to set up an alarm that only goes off on those 4 days without having to disable the alarm on the 3 days I don't work. I set it to randomly select music from a particular album on my phone, and it starts very softly and gradually increases in volume. Another great feature is that you can set the alarm to sound even if the phone is set to vibrate, so you don't have to remember to turn the phone sound on before going to bed. You can have multiple alarms set up at the same time. When I first got this app, I didn't fully trust it, so I continued to set my regular alarm clock too. After a few weeks, this app has never crashed or failed to alarm, so now it is my only alarm clock in the morning. Highly recommended!

B005EHNMWM|5.0|The first time I listened to this was on headphones in the library, studying for finals.  I couldn't hold still, listening to the last minutes of the first track, \\"Art of Almost.\\"    Over the weekend, we put it on in the living room and it was the perfect soundtrack to the quiet, sunny fall days, just hanging around the house with our three little kids.  Now I'm listening to \\"One Sunday Morning,\\" really hearing the story, and that paired with the beautiful music is making me cry.  So I've read some reviews that say Wilco's music has no purpose or direction.  I disagree.  Its purpose is to be right there with you in your life, making you move, making you think.  Someday, years from now, when I hear this album, I'll remember exactly what my life was like this fall.  Wilco always does that for me.

In aworld where intellect must reign supreme pure emotion is asked to take a back seat again.  well not in this film. it is passionate, superb and enticing.a true gem hidden in the folds of humanity. some people could learn from this movie. it has a fascinating plot, awesome fight scenes and engaging storyline. all in all its a must see for both young audiences and above. let the detractors of this movie know this... get over it or get hit by a truck . Thank you and God Bless.
0385340990|5.0|This was an awesome book. I bought one for myself and one for my 80+ year old friend.  Her words of expression about the era in which it was written meant so much to me.  It is written in a very easy to read format. The book spoke of the bond between people brought about by the hardships in that community because of the war. It is an inspiring book of hope and survival and of caring about our neighbors..I strongly reccommend this book to any one interested in the WW 2 period.
B00000FC5H|5.0|A few years ago I bought this Greatest Hits by Earth, Wind,& Fire and I played  it till the groves were gone.  It was my favorite CD and I was so sad when it kept  skipping all over the place.  Well, I finally gave up and tossed it hoping that I  would find it again someday.  I was on Amazon and decided to check out and see if  I could find it to buy. I was so happy to find that very CD and I couldn't wait  til it arrived at my house.  I now can play this CD over and over again.  Thanks Amazon.  One Happy Granny!

B0055CJ8T2|4.0|I've always been a fan of Kelly since Destiny's Child and when she went solo. I think she's always had great singles, but never quite the full album to back it up. On Here I Am, she worked with some great producers and did some nice collaborations as well. I would've loved to see her do a nice ballad on the album though. I heard Commander sometime last year and still am not a big fan of it, but the rest of the album is pretty nice.  All in all the album is really good and I'm glad to see her get the recognition she deserves! It definitely is worth a listen.
1609611543|5.0|I have been frustrated as to why many of my annoying health symptoms never got significantly better, despite my healthy, sugar-free, lots of veggies, fruits, only whole wheat diet.  I have never lost any significant amount of weight except when I followed a Atkins-like diet.  I have been mostly wheat and bread free for about a month.  My annoying gastrointestinal symptoms have disappeared.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Let's Get Digital / B005DC68NI  I've read a couple of self-publishing guides so far and I have to say that this one is the best yet. The writing is clear, concise, and best of all doesn't seem to have a chip on the author's shoulder towards anyone or anything else. The advice is good, the layout is well-organized, and the price is right.  The book itself is cut into three sections. The first section covers a short history of publishing and some of the whys and wherefores of self-publishing. This is all well and good, but will be something of skimming material for anyone already convinced that self-publishing is the way to go. The second section covers the broad hows of self-publishing and there's a wealth of information here about the different online retailers and how this will affect non-US authors and readers. The third section is a series of interviews with successful indie authors, and the fourth section has a wealth of resources and cross-links worth checking out.   This book will definitely be a resource that I refer back to in the future. The strong organization makes it easy to drill down to a specific area and the sparse prose is perfect for a reference book. I highly recommend this resource for new and wanna-be indie authors.   ~ Ana Mardoll
B005LAZIRY|5.0|I don't care what Opeth fans think of the 'new' generation of the band making an album that resembles Porcupine Tree and King Crimson.  What's wrong with trying to imitate the best?  I personally think that Ghost Reveries will be the best album that Opeth ever does, being the last album by my favorite variation of the lineup.  However, Michael Ackerfeld produces this album and makes the next generation of the band, much like Xavier with the X-Men, a leaner, meaner, more variable expansion of the entire history of the Opeth sound, thus explaining the name of the album.  The fact that Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree, King Crimson) mixes it only makes it more special since he hasn't helped out with an Opeth production since Damnation/Deliverance.  His ears are an asset to any psychedelic/progressive band that is influenced by the 60's/70's.  As mentioned above in the title this album is better than the American progressive metal bands latest albums by Mastodon and Dream Theater.  I like all three bands but my tastes in new albums prefer this one over the other two.  I like Mastodon more proggy and Dream Theater more psychic/mean like Train of Thought.  With Opeth I haven't made a decision what I think they \\"should\\" make so this album is very refreshing coming from someone (me) who sings and plays guitar like Michael Ackerfeld.  Ghost Reveries is the best but this album is better that the direction of Damnation if you like that side of Opeth.

I would also reccomend getting the recipie book as it can get alittle hard to be creative without the inspiration.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have had the SwiftKey original keyboard since Amazon gave it out for free. Then I went to the windows 7 phone, and came back to android just because of this app and angry bids seasonal. I love the new keyboard that they just released! I would never trade any one for this keyboard even if the keyboard way the swipe. The swipe keyboard is the worst keyboard of all time. This keyboard learns you after a while.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Good premise although not entirely true it does provide a good representation of \\"what it would be like\\" to have complete use of your faculties. Good power play and visuals. If you look for it you can even find some good inspiration to get your things in order and try to \\"be your best\\".
1609611543|5.0|A very informative and thought-provoking book about a national health tragedy; a health situation that is so terribly and personally critical to so many people. The tie-in to \\"guns, germs and steel\\"  in the last chapter makes one really rethink the history of western civilization and the intrinsic role of wheat.  Anyone who is pre-diabetic should read this book.  I won't comment on the role of the FDA and the actual economic vice health reasons why the current government policies exist: there are many other fine books available for those who might be curious.  I certainly will never view wheat and gluten the same way again. Absolutely recommended.
B0055S348W|4.0|I had an initial problem with set up..<br /> but got it to work and it works well... it's closer to 4.5 stars than the 4 I gave it. It comes in handy.  I would say the $ is worth it but I did get it for free with the free paid app of the day.
B00466HN86|5.0|This is a great movie, a must see for fathers, sons, AND mothers and daughters!  I saw this with my husband, youngest son and daughter.  Now I need to send my other four sons and two daughters-in-law!  What an encouraging message in a world where men are so often made to feel irrelevant and unnecessary in the family!
B004IFYMWK|2.0|\\"Fair Game\\" is about a serious criminal event that occurred during the Cheney Administration.  It deserved a far better presentation; it needed less chaotic direction and a male star who didn't bull his way through the role. I hate to agree with those who dislike this film because it tells a politically disagreeable truth that they don't want known, but it just isn't very good.  The one star above the minimum is for Naomi Watts for showing up in front of the cameras.
031603441X|4.0|If you want to bend your mind, try watching Lixin Fan's amazing film documentary \\"Last Train Home\\" after you've read about half of Keith Richards \\"Life\\". The unlikely combo made me think of the contrast between the Morlocks and the Eloi (H.G. Welles)
B00466HN86|5.0|So much of what comes out in theaters is just an escape from every day life.  That's a shame because every day life is where we live and how we live there is what we are truly accountable for.  This is one of the rare and exceptional movies with a message that encourages you to look for an entrance back into every day life and to make it meaningful rather than to escape from it by making it seem more meaningless.  I wish there were more movies like this one that would encourage us that way.  But I am grateful that at least there is one.  If you are a man, especially if you are a father - do whatever it takes to see this movie.  Be challenged, be broken, be encouraged... be courageous.  And let's be honest.  Most of the time spent watching movies at the theater is just wasted.  You will not be wasting your time on this one.  In fact, I would say this is one of the few movies you can see where the time and money that you spend is actually an investment.    So what are you waiting for?  Get on the phone and call up some buddies and go and see this movie.  Today.
B0050PLT8W|3.0|I liked 3 or 4 songs. A lot more foul language was used than necessary. It is less commercial than their previous CD.

B0000640VO|4.0|If you're not sick of Audrey Tautou (early this Century, it seemed to me that she was the ONLY actress to come from France) you definitely have to watch this movie.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|...but that doesn't make it bad. I am a fan of many genres of music, including extreme metal, but Opeth has outgrown it. I respect the band's decision to make a different kind of art than what they were known for in the past. The people who give this a 1 star review must be strictly metal fans, not music or Opeth fans. They are probably the same people who hate Devin Townsend's work post-SYL. Open your mind and embrace one of the best active bands in the world. This is a beautiful, inspired, somber album. Respect it as such.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|It is always nice when you can take your favorite movie and expand it in such a way that the final product is even better than the original!

B000FAGGWQ|5.0|This disc features the excellent documentary \\"Empire of Dreams\\" which also appeared in a heavily edited and truncated form on American television in 2004 when the disc first appeared. Running at 2 hours and 30 minutes this is without a doubt the best of all the \\"Making of...\\" documentaries covering the production of the Original Trilogy.<br />Sold as part of a box set I have held onto this disc keenly aware that it was very unlikely that this disc would reappear when the series arrived on Blu-ray (time has proven me correct on this prediction).<br />Now this disc sits with the 3 theatrical release non-anamorphic DVDs (that appeared two years later as bonus materials to the individual releases)in a 4-disc Blu-ray case (with a custom cover) sitting alongside the Blu-ray series which I opted to begrudgingly purchase due to the presence of the 3 OT documentaries.<br />Incidentally this disc also features the 15 minute \\"The Birth of the Lightsaber\\" and the 19 minute \\"The Characters of Star Wars\\".<br />If you can find anyone willing the part with this DVD I would recommend purchasing it.
B0053B347M|3.0|These lights are pretty pointless unless you are sitting in a room that is pitch black. The lights need to be brighter to make any difference, not worth the money.<br /><br />UPDATE: After a long time I decided to use these under my desk to light my pull out keyboard. They work perfectly for this as they are only on when the computer is. Not the intended purpose but definitely useful.
B00466HN86|5.0|Awesome movie! I challenge every father and husband to see this movie so they can assume their roles and we can end this Fatherless society we have going on.  I didn't realize that there would be so much humor in the movie beside all the emotion in it as well.  The movie industry really needs to make more movies like this!!  More wholesome quality - family movies!!!!
0307272702|4.0|Extremely informative and logical. My takeaway from this? Conscious intake of starchy, high glycemic carbs is a very doable way to keep a handle on weight control. Listened to this on audio. The science was a bit hard to get through at times, but the lessons learned here worth the effort.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|It seems to take forever to get a new update. seems like the updates are taking longer and longer to come out. Otherwise love the game.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I don't normally write reviews but I found myself wanting to write this one,for some reason.  I guiess that I just wanted to clear the air about both the bad and good reviews on this book.  I can see why it got both bad and excellent reviews. I'll brake it down for those who are confussed and torn.<br /><br />1). This book was a romance novel about a good girl and a very bad boy.  The ones who use and abuse girls. Travis, (the character) bad-boy-hottie is attracted to Page and falls in love after denying their feelings for many chapters.  The story mostly consists of him trying to figure out how to enter into a relationship and maintain it, which is hard for someone who's never had one.<br /><br />2). Most of the book is of them trying to work it out.  Him behaving badly, her forgiving him. Him becoming very posessive and jealous and even crazy at times. And add to that a small twist of danger throwed in the mix.<br /><br />Overall opinion????  If your looking for a love story without much action and like the Alpha male types.....you'll love it.  If your like me and like a love story with lots of action and danger, its not for you. I love the alpha male types but felt that this one was a little over the top. In the end, it wasn't a bad book.  Though i wouldn't read it again, I was glad i got it. The author did a fairly good job of weaving the story together, especially for a self-published one.
0786891416|4.0|I'm a big fan of the TV show Castle and had been dying to read the Nikki Heat books supposedly written by Nathan Fillion's character. In Heat Wave, I found great writing, wonderful character chemistry and an unbeatable mystery. I also found my mind making constant connections to the show, which was both distracting and confusing at times.<br /><br />It's hard not to compare Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook to Kate Beckett and Richard Castle from the show. The book is written under the premise that Castle is the author and Beckett is his muse. All signs point to Castle writing a very biographic character in Jameson Rook - from the last name to hs quippy humor to the fact he's a writer (articles instead of novels) working with the police. Nikki is written like Castle's fantasy Beckett, she's just like Kate but willing to give into her attraction to the writer in her life. Having watched the TV show for years, the line often becomes blurred between the two.<br /><br />With a little reader effort, one can actively disassociate the show and the book allowing for a great reading experience. This would be a wonderful mystery even if it had no pop culture connection. It's reasonably fast paced and definitely keeps you guessing. Readers who don't watch the show may enjoy Heat Wave even more than fans, as they'll be able to fully immerse themselves into the plot and characters without preconceived ideas of how things are supposed to go.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Gary Cooper is at his very best in Sergeant York, one of his two performances that won an Oscar (the other being High Noon).  The eponymous Alvin York insisted Cooper be the one to play him.  It is enjoyably light-hearted in the first half as it deals with his mishaps and conversion to Christianity in the Tennessee backwoods, then shifts to a serious patriotic theme as he wrestles with balancing duty to God with duty to country.  The trench warfare scene is riveting and shows you the horror of war very effectively without getting inappropriately graphic.  The music of Max Steiner is also outstanding.  Included are special features about the movie and Gary Cooper which you should enjoy.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|I was looking forward to getting my kids an Ultimate Collection of Blu-Rays for the kids to watch over Christmas vacation. This collection is a rehash of the older DVDs. I'll be renting from Blockbuster instead. Maybe next year.
B005GSY23M|4.0|Ok so the title was to get anyone's attention who is looking for, in my opinion, the keystone song of the soundtrack.    It's Brian Eno's \\"An Ending (Ascent)\\" off the album Apollo:  [[ASIN:B0007GFFUW Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks]]  I would want to know that before I bought this album. This is a very solid soundtrack though.  I know - buy both albums and you'll be doubly happy!
B0056BU3I2|5.0|It's been a long time since the Jason Bourne Triology that I could be so fascinated by an action movie. The beautiful scenes of Rio, the ultra charming cast (all men and women look like catwalk models), the not too stupid storyline and most importantly the superb though much exaggerated car chases add up to the most entertaining of all 20+ movies I saw this year. Really looking forward to Fast 6 as hinted by the ending scene. In short, a must watch for all action movie fans!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is such a fun game! I was obsessed and played through until I beat everything in less than a week! Definitely worth 99 cents, if they keep updates and levels coming then it's definitely worth even more!   Easy to pick up and play, medium difficulty to master it, very polished graphics and smooth gameplay. This game is an A+
0385333846|4.0|I read this book as a teenager and liked it, but didn't quite get it.  I recently reread it and must say it is an excellent read. It's strength is as a humanistic war memoir that perfectly captures the horrors of war, it's really not a science fiction book in my opinion. I interpretted the whole subplot about being kidnapped by aliens as a delusional fantasy invented by the protagonist to deal with the repressed pain from his war experience when he was just a \\"baby\\" as Vonnegut's friends wife references in his intro. I have nothing against suspending disbelief when reading science fiction, but for this book, to me this is the most satisfying interpretation. It fits perfectly with Piligrim's dissastisfaction with his marriage- he's conveniently mated with a porn star by the aliens- and his obsession with Kilgore Trout- who just happened to have written a very similar story. To deal with horrific flashbacks, he invents utopian flash fowards where perception of time and space are altered- thus becoming unstuck in time. It is only in this new altered way of viewing time and death that the world could make sense to him.   That being said, enjoyed the book very much, I look forward to rediscovering more Vonnegut. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is Vonnegut is sometimes annoyingly clever, \\"and so it goes\\" ad nauseum for example, and the couple times in the book where he breaks down the fourth wall so to speak,  and pops into the narrative as himself for no apparent reason other than to be clever. Distracting from otherwise superb prose. Also his little doodles didn't add much at all.
0061537969|4.0|This book was great. It was emotional and touching and funny at the same time. I really enjoyed the narration by the dog. It was a nice easy read, not too long.
B005CKPQHA|5.0|I really feel season four is turning out even better than the third. The latter was just setting the stage for this next chapter. The only complaint I have is it seems this season has a lot more blatant product placement written into the script. From computer brands to snack chips it's sad seeing these little advertisements sneak into such a well thought out story.
0385534639|5.0|This was the best book i have read in a long time, and I read a lot of books! If you enjoyed books such as The Magicians, you will love this 10x more! I founf myself up until the early morning unable to put this book down. The story and magical and romantic and you find yourself really feeling the characters emotions. This is a must read.

1594744769|4.0|Author Ransom Riggs has come up with a clever way to attract interest and illustrate his new fantasy novel MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN.  He has taken some unusual \\"authentic, vintage found photographs\\" (many of which obviously employ trick photography) and crafted his novel around them.   The novel is told by Jacob a sixteen year old boy from a privileged background who has never really fit in with anyone but his eighty something grandfather.  Grandpa, A Polish Jewish WWII refugee, told him weird stories and showed him strange pictures of his youth spent partly at a children's home on a Welsh island. When Grandpa is killed in front of Jacob by what authorities deem a pack of wild dogs Jacob is determined to travel to the island and find out everything he can about the peculiar children's home and those that lived there.  He is aided by some cryptic clues left for him by his grandfather.  As is usual in these types of books the first three quarters of the book are the best as the ending portion tends to just fizzle out while leaving plenty of room for sequels.  Still this is a better than average teen book incorporating WWII themes with the trials of those who are different in a unique format.
B005DI65L2|5.0|I loved this book, and read it twice. I did not know all that much about dogs when I read this book, which might be why it was so fascinating for me, but really, it was incredibly informative and I really liked the author. You got such a strong sense of who she was and what an awesome person she is. I can't believe how many 1 star reviews there are. It doesn't seem warranted, but to each there own of course.
B005MP28B2|2.0|Well, this movie is very emotional, has some great meanings and teachings for everyone. But in the other hand, and my personal opinion, i fell like the movie tries so damn hard to make some points, i get simbolism, but it gets really annoying when is overcharged with it, for example what was the reason of the first 40 minutes of the movie?, it would be easily be done the exact same concept in 10.   Is a nice movie, but thats all for me, i wouldnt see it again. With great potencial, i fell like the movie was kill for its overproduction.
B004LROMSO|5.0|I just finished watching season one of \\"Camelot\\". I really enjoyed it especially Joseph Fiennes performance as Merlin. Jamie Campbell Bower was excellent in his role as Arthur. I loved the music and the beautiful scenery. I hope there is a second season. Truly enjoyed season one.
B0058VW36U|1.0|so I got this app free 2 or 3 days ago and today it uninstalled and said I I have to buy it even though the app was in my app drawer....sucks
0439023513|3.0|I don't know...this book kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I'm too faint-hearted for all this killing, but something just felt off somehow.   Its not that I want the storybook ending, but I think that for a story to be worth telling, it should be a story where some sort of transformation occurs. Why was this story told? What was so extraordinary about it? By the end our protagonist is beaten down to a point where she is unrecognizable.  A lot of people here are writing that this book gives us reality. But what is so great about real? What sets this story apart? Why was this story told instead of the other thousands of stories? How did anyone overcome anything?   Look, this world is depressing and horrible enough as it is. If you are going to go through the trouble of making up a story, tell us one where people are good, where they rise above something. Inspire us!    I lost sleep over these books, they were troubling. Mockingjay was rushed and unresolved. Suzanne told us about the bad in the world, but she didn't really tell us about the good.
B005MYEQ9U|4.0|Why not 5 stars for such luxuriously beautiful musical performance?<br />Indeed, the female singers almost scored perfect marks: Netrebko, Garanca and Elisabeth Kulman, all sung with flying colours, especially Kulman and Garanca, who displayed not only exceedingly good vocal timbres, but also tremendous portrayals. Anna Netrebko is better here than in MET's Lucia di Lammermoor, with perhaps the only reservation that hers isn't a true dramatic coloratura, and the last Scene is not as emotionally eruptive as it should be.<br />Garanca has a mesmerizing deep mezzo soprano with a vibrant top register that would easily put any top soprano to shame, and her duet wit Anna Netrebko is the high point of this performance, undoubtedly. Her coloratura technique is also rock solid. As Smeton,<br />Kulman's trouser role is also tremendously well sung and acted, almost the most vocally stunning performance of the evening, to many's real surprise. She sang with real limpid beauty, with a firm grasp of the bel canto style.<br />As for the male roles, I regret to say that they are less outstanding than the ladies.<br />First of all, I have a strong feeling that Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is severely miscast as Enrico VIII. He is neither regal nor powerful. His bass baritone is lyrical, but lacks the deep punch and squillo required of this role that previously was so well-portrayed by Cesare Siepi and other real basso. Visually, alas, the quasi-gypsie king hardly looked the part he was playing.<br />As for the 'lover', young tenor Francesco Melli's performance is highly variable. He has the goods, no doubt, but it does appear that he needs more experience and confidence to convince 'himself' that he IS the tenor for the big roles. As it is, his performance smacks tentativeness and though there are no lack of great moments, at many other instances his portrayal is not convincing enough.<br />Lastly, the sets and costumes are not historically informed, as Tudor women were not allowed to show off their hair as they do in this production.w off their hair as they do in this production.
0525423281|5.0|Wow. Absolutely amazing. Phenomenal. And now for the complete sentences. I was hooked from the start. I have to admit, I wasn't sure if this could be as good as Anna and the French Kiss, but it blew me out of the water. Lola was the most amazing character I have come across. She lives her life in costume, wearing wigs, clothes she makes, she's anything but conventional. And it makes the story. She marches to the beat of her own drum. And I applaud Stephanie Perkins for creating such a fantastic character.<br /><br />I would also like to applaud Stephanie Perkins for is the parents. Lola has two dads. And neither of them are flamboyant or girly. She created such a strong, supportive family for Lola. I really loved the scenes with her fathers. Even more, I loved Lola's love of her fathers. Very charming and heartwarming. Really.<br /><br />I'm going to admit, and it's probably the same consensus through most other readers, I didn't care for her hot rocker boyfriend. I didn't like the way he spoke about Lola's dads, the way he felt like he had to suffer them to be with Lola. Not a well respected guy in my book. Plus, I'm a sucker for the underdog. And Cricket had my full support. Plus, Cricket was all about Lola from the start. He wanted to know how she was, was concerned for her and would do anything for her. He was perfect.<br /><br />Another thing I loved? Anna and St. Clair were in this book. A lot! I loved to see them after the whole 'I like you but don't know how you feel about me' part of Anna and the French Kiss. Not that I didn't love the first. I did, but I was so glad to see them after, see how devoted they are to each other and to get that glimpse of them so happy together. Stephanie Perkins, I'm very grateful to get a chance to see more of Anna and St. Clair!<br /><br />This is a must read. This author is a must read. Stephanie Perkins has a talent for writing fantastic young adult romance and I hope to see many more from her. This is definitely going on my 'must reread' list along with the first book.t book.

0439023521|4.0|I waited a long time to purchase this book, but glad I did. The writer has a way, of taking mundane everyday things in life and making them interesting. The pace was a whirlwind, but I felt the story took to long to actually get to the arena. By the time she got off the train at the arena area, I felt the book could have moved forward at bit faster.I was most disappointed with the end. Not because of the end itself, but because, before I finished the book, I did a web search on the next books in the series and on that web-site the end to this book was given away. It did spoil the end for me since I already knew what was going to happen.
0821221841|5.0|Although an abridged version of the original, it remains a good book for the serious black and white photographer.  It is almost impossible (and very costly) to find the original book, therefore, this makes for a good substitute.  It was delivered on time.  Great buy.

After Brian gets news that makes him want to stop running the team decides to pull off one last heist.  I have never been a real big fan of the series.  They are good but have mostly been \\"I have car...I go fast.\\"  The fourth one was the best because it actually had a story to it.  Then I saw this one.  Far and away the best of the series so far.  For those that watched them for the racing I should warn you, there is only one scene in this one.  This one was more in the style of \\"Oceans 11\\" then a \\"Fast & Furious\\" movie.  I'm not sure if the sixth one they are making is needed, but like all movies lately they will make them until they make one too many...then the remakes start.  That reason aside this is a very fun and exciting heist movie very much worth watching.  Overall, I surprisingly liked it a lot and highly recommend this.  I give this a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch it again? - I think I would, I can't say that about the other four.<br /><br />*Also try - Fast & Furious 1-4 & Takers

B004EPZ08E|3.0|\\"Our lives would be a hell of a lot better if our bosses weren't alive.\\" Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis), and Dale (Day) all hate their bosses. All of them believe they have the worst boss ever and have sufficient evidence to back this up. When they reach their breaking point they start to plan on killing their bosses. When the wheels start rolling it isn't long until they fall off and things don't go as planned. This is a movie I had high hoped for. I think that Jason Bateman is one of the funniest people and the plot seemed like it would be awesome. While I did like this movie it was a little disappointing. The funniest parts in this one they began to do over and over and by the fifth time they did the joke it wasn't that funny anymore. I do think that the hype behind this one, as well as watching the \\"Change Up\\" before this one had a lot to do with my opinion though. All the actors are perfectly cast and there are laughs, but it's not a constant laugh-out-loud movie like I expected. I will close by saying something I never thought I would...Jennifer Aniston is the best part of this movie. Overall, I recommend this but lower your expectations. I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I might but just for Aniston.<br /><br />*Also try - Hall Pass & School For Scoundrels
B0057GYOA4|1.0|This remastered version is WAY over compressed... dynamics destroyed and you can hear it clearly on the drums. snare and kick became flat and when loud guitars takes over, the drums loses even more punch and gets buried under. as an album listening experience, I got tired after 3 songs.  Stick to the original.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|This series is extremely entertaining, but it's not for the feint of heart.  There is a lot of substance to the various subplots, but, be warned, when there's gore, there's plenty of it!  The Walking Dead is like Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead on steroids.  There's plenty here to enjoy, but keep a blanket handy for those who may need a quick escape.

B00005Y46O|4.0|It somehow has been quite hard for me to listen to, say, 15 Free songs in a row. Don't know why but there are not too many studio versions of their best songs that I really enjoy. Other songs usually just pass by and I barely notice them. However, most bands of the 70s were a sight to see (and hear) during their live shows. Turns out Free were exactly that way. I have to say that I keep returning to this album time after time and still find it great. Would recommend this instead of any other \\"regular\\" album. Most of the songs on this album sound different, more interesting and stronger than the original studio versions.
B001NHNG64|5.0|In the last three weeks I've read the third, first, and this the second Reacher novel in that sequence. As far as I'm concerned, Lee Child has mastered the ex-military thriller venue.  I'll probably read most them in the coming months because they are uniquely original and fast paced and hard to put down.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|I am glad I watched someone else's movie before I spent money on this lousy thing.  I will always be on my do not buy list.  Rose what's her name is not worth seeing in the movie.  It would have been better without her all together.  And she didn't hold a candle to Megan Fox.  I did like the FIRST TWO movies but this one is a total waste.  Boring from the word go other than some things about Kennedy and the early space program.  It would have been better as a cartoon.  If they come out with another one, I will not be spending any money on it.  This one was so boring during the middle of it I about fell asleep.  I would not waste the money on it, just borrow someone else's movie and save your money for a good movie.  Oh and I might give it a 2.5/10 but since this is on a 5 scale it only gets a 1 and I would have given the other 2 movies a 4/5.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Finally able to watch the entire series, plus the movie (which I never heard existed)! Once I finally get the chance to, at least. This box set is surely a find, and was surely a great deal for the price when it was a Gold Box deal. I must've been one of many people who ordered the box set, as it was nearly backordered when I placed mine. Worth the short wait, though!
B004ZNARH4|2.0|When I first heard DSOFTM was going to be re-released in box form I was through the roof in excitement. I thought, finally they're gonna open the vaults. Well, that didn't happen. To all those hard core PF fans out there I say: Save your money! Unless of course your missing a scarf and marbles to add to your collection. You have heard EVERYTHING that is presented here before. The one piece of music that is truly great is the live disk, which is simply terrific. I was hoping to see more. More unreleased tracks, more alternative mixes... just more damn it! I love the Floyd and will always be a fan, but this is a huge disappointment and doesn't offer much more than what you've already heard. Damn, this could have been great.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|This book was even better than the first.  I am in love with  Fifty( swoon).  He is right up there on my favorite list along with Barrons :<br /><br />I kept expecting the other shoe to drop throughout the entire book.  They had such wonderful happy times and I kept expecting dominant Fifty to return.  Their emails are so freaking funny I loved that back and fourth banter between them.  I'm relieved the second book was already out when I read the first one because the first ending was pure torture to think I had to wait for the other one.  We get a nice tidy ending this time that lets me be patient enough for the third book.  I love their confusing relationship and all her self-doubts because she is just so REAL.  Her inner goddess deserves a book all of her own because she is just so damn spunky!!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Purchased my 2nd pair of these headphones because the 1st ones were so awesome but I lost them. Order placed 9-28 headphones delivered 10-1! For about $12 total I can't imagine a better pair of headphones. I use mines mostly for running. My only complaint is while im running they tend to slip a little but to fix that I just  wear a headband over them to keep them snug or you can wear them under your hat. Great bass, good overall sound! Extremely lightweight. I won't be buying any other headphones besides these ever!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I LOVED my Kindle app on my ipad... until recently when Kindle removed the purchase button.  So I went to the Amazon app thinking I could purchase ebooks there.  However, there is currently no way to purchase e-materials there, either.  And on the ipad, the amazon site is very non user friendly.  So I have not been able to purchase anything since the \\"upgrade.\\"  Poor planning on Kindle/Amazons part.

1609611543|5.0|I ordered WHEAT BELLY because of an article I read in a woman's magazine.  It made so much sense that I ordered  the book right away, and it is working.  I am losing weight and I feel so much  better.  Amazon sent it to me overnight.  I wish I could share the information with more people.  There is vital health information in this book.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Let me just get this out of the way and say that I agree that most of the changes Lucas has made are unnecessary.  And I agree that he should make the original unedited version available.  But that's not what he's done.  That said, I prefer to judge things on their own merits, and I don't see that any of his changes have hurt the story or the characters.  Specifically I don't think Darth Vader saying \\"no\\" at the end of Return of the Jedi hurts his character in any way at all (it is not the sad \\"no\\" of a man who believes he has killed the love of his life, it is the defiant \\"no\\" of a man who has just realized that all the mistakes of his life have led to a moment where he is actually watching his own son being murdered).  Even with all the changes Lucas has made, I still love these movies from beginning of episode I to the end of episode VI.  The blu-ray quality is exactly what you'd expect.  The colors are bright, the details amazing.  In many scenes you can now see the actual texture of the cloth used in the costumes, even the very fine lines in the Imperial uniforms.  The only downside is that A New Hope was made on what was basically a shoe-string budget for sci-fi at the time, and there are a few details (like being able to see brush strokes in the paint, or flaws in the original models) that you don't really want to see, but those are easy to overlook.  The sound is also great, esp. if you have a surround system.  Long story short, these are still amazing stories of adventure and heroism that are certain to last a long time despite Lucas' changes to them.  As an artist myself I can completely understand that sometimes you have to \\"turn in\\" work that you're not completely satisfied with, and he is simply going back and trying to fix some of the details that he wasn't satisfied with the first time around.  The stories told in the Star Wars movies are so rich and inspiring and the characters so iconic that the movies have even been used as teaching aids for philosophy and religious studies around the world.  These stories still retain that power (even after the much debated changes) and I believe will continue to do so for generations.
B005HPA2XI|1.0|Attempts to revive the past never feel sincere, doesn't matter if you're trying to revive first wave punk or hippie culture. And while prog rock revivalism complete with noodly moog solos definitely beats rapping, breakdown-core and other commercial metal trends that have come and gone in the past couple decades, guys like Mastodon and Opeth still haven't taken the first step toward putting out something genuine and personal. This is pastiche. The adult swim kids who just got into metal will gobble it up and talk about \\"open-mindedness\\" and experimentalism, but their dads were listening to more adventurous music than this before they were born.<br /><br />So even though it's rather benign musically, as one of The Marketable Things right now, I feel it deserves at least one review here calling it out on its retro-ironic shallowness.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I was trying to become a singer or songwriter, but it was hard for me to write the music, i can make a melody in my mind when i'm writtingg something, i do have a certifict in the house for a packet of lyrics i sent to be copywriter, but i didn't make copies of the lyrics, and they say if you change the lyric you have to get it copywrited again, i just really don't have the money to live up to my dream, so i just keep it has a hobbie, my mother discurages me alot, i don't have much support about my dream. But, Danny Wood from new Kids On the Block told me in an e-mail that the the music business is 50/50 and i want my music and lyrics to be my own and not let anyone change what i write, it's very competive in it, and i can't play an instument very well. but i can hum things out like i did when i had study hall in school. I'm a little jelous of this singe Adele, Cause I'm Adele Thompson, I still like to write songs as a hobbie. and do karaokee. Why dose the world have to judge me on my disablity? Wel now i just listened to the song \\"someone like you\\" i just saw the video on TV, and now i like the singer Adele. she's pretty just like i am.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|I am a life long fan of Lenny Kravitz and I even got to meet him once. This Cd seems more like the classic Lenny that I love vs. his last two CDs which while good, don't capture his true ability like \\"Lenny\\" and \\"Are you Gonna Go My Way\\" do. The sound is great and the lyrics deep. If you are really into Lenny you're gonna like this one!
B001PPGAJY|5.0|I got this movie promptly and at a good price, this is one of my all time favorite movies so I was happy to get it
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I replaced my standard keyboard with SwiftKey X after developing a problem with standard keyboard. I find the key shape and size to be a little awkward, compared to the standard, which is why I didn't give five stars. Other than that personal preference, SwiftKey is excellent. The predictive texting system is the best I've ever used. Also it's nice to be able to enter numbers and symbols without switching key screens. Overall, I'm quite satisfied, and will be sticking with SwiftKey.
B000W10AEI|5.0|I received this movie promptly, and I got it at a great price.  That is a win win situation for me.
B00466HN86|5.0|Watched the movie 02 Oct 2011.<br />Every Father should see this movie. It makes points in ways no other movie has.<br />Very well worth taking the whole family as well.
B0035WTJFW|4.0|I recieved this movie promptly and I got it at a great price so I was pretty happy about that.  That is a win win
B00417HV14|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is excellent. This is already my most watched Bluray. But I was sorely disappointed the first time I watched it. The video is DVD quality at best and the 5.1 surround sound is substandard. The second time I watched, I increased the center channel volume seven clicks and the sound was better, but still not good. I have a very good sound system connected through HDMI and I was expecting the usual digital experience. I thought maybe I had a defective Bluray disc. The third time I watched, I switched to pcm stereo in the Bluray menu and the sound is acceptable. Joe's performance deserved better. If you drop back to stereo, after a while, you may be immersed in the performance and not be bothered much by the video and audio quality. Just enjoy the riffs, you'll barely notice it's stereo.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is fun, engaging, and fairly challenging. I like trying to out-score myself and definitely want more screens. Highly recommend for anyone wanting a good puzzler.
0307477479|2.0|This book was one of the oddest books I've ever read. I didn't understand the connections to the characters, WHY I was reading about them/their stories and didn't care about the activities they did. I wouldn't recommend this book to friends.
1904233023|5.0|Have you ever heard that? This book or that book changed my life? Well, Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card changed my life.   As a busy professional, I never seemed to have time to read fiction like the way I had devoured all Heinlein and Asimov in my school library growing up. Once I had children, it was nails in the coffin of reading as a pastime. All that changed when I picked up Ender's Game during a family Thanksgiving trip in 2006. I finished the book (made possible by cousins/aunts/uncles/grandparents available to entertain my children while my nose was stuck firmly in the spine...) and IMMEDIATELY began reading it again. I was entranced by OSC's story of children in battle school, one boy's struggle to do what's right, to figure out what's right, to know what's right, about families and big huge universe-ending issues. The story was at once small and intimate and huge and all-encompassing.   I *had* to figure out how he did it, so I read and re-read Ender's Game and I made a New Year's resolution. I was going to figure out how OSC did it, and I was going to write my own stories.   It's 2011 now and I have four stories for sale on the Kindle store and another dozen written, just waiting for my attention on my hard drive. If I hadn't read Ender's Game at that time in my life, I might not have done anything with my writing dreams (which, for the record, I didn't know I had until I got sucked into that book.)   So Ender's Game changed my life. Will it change yours?
030788743X|5.0|I had a great time reading Ready Player One.  Is it great literature?  Not really.  Is it for everyone?  Definitely not!  But if you were like me, spending all your allowance on video games in the arcade, or diving into role-playing games, or watching movies over and over until you knew every line... then you'll find something here to love.  This is a fast-paced, fantastic adventure, both online and in real life. Even if I'm not as hard-core as these characters, I know people who are.  Funny, shocking, and thoroughly entertaining, I recommend checking it out.    The only downside was that when I read it on an airplane, the kindly 70-something grandma asked me what it was about, and despite my best efforts I think she still believes I'm insane.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Could not figure out why it was Chickenfoot III as I couldn't ever remember a II.  Then I opened up the package and saw the 3D anaglyph's!  OUTSTANDING packaging.  Makes me want to buy one more just to archive.  I put the music on and I've been playing this CD over and over and over.  Great mix of rockers and even a ballad.  What surprised me was the raw sound of \\"three and a half letter\\" in which Sammy screams, \\"I NEED A JOB, I'M WILLING TO WORK, BUT I NEED A JOB!\\"  If that doesn't sum up this obamanation economy I don't know what does.  Loving \\"Different Devil\\" \\"Bigfoot\\" and \\"Dubai Blues.\\"  This is a very FUN CD in both sight and sound.  Buy it!
B000JQUGVI|5.0|I don't know if I can really add anything to a review of the book that hasn't already been said. It was a long, epic story involving a \\"Novel Without a Hero.\\" Although I'd really argue that Becky Sharp is the book's antihero, a woman of unlimited ambition who tries to climb her way up the ladder of society. The book is also over 800 pages, which makes it a long but eventually rewarding adventure.<br /><br />The Kindle version was fine, although it lacked a proper table of contents. I can't complain much about a free version of a book unless it was horrendously bad.
0061353248|5.0|This book is great. I read it first and liked it. I bought some other books about behavioral economics and when I read this book a second time I found it much more interesting. There had been many things that I did not understand the first time. I see how some people gave it a low review, if you don't get it, you don't get it. Dan Ariely is genius. I ended up looking at all his TED talks which are amazing too. Highly recommended.
0321701763|2.0|advanced user of ps from 1 or 2 thru cs3, got a little behind on the new stuff on cs4 and 5. this book almost never answers my questions. I usually find a lesson or description and then need to search online for the info I really need. Also a style thing - I like a reference book, don't tend to sit through tutorials. I find I usually get a tiny amount of new info amidst a ton of knowledge I already have. So, if you like doing lessons/tutorials and you're brand new to PS, then this book may work for you. But to me it seems like a more detailed basic manual.
B004RPKUTU|4.0|Coraline was very creepy.  And I loved it.  I can only imagine what a kid thinks as they read it.  I found it creepy and unsettling as an adult.<br /><br />When the movie first came out, I wanted to watch it very badly.  It's the type of movie that I love and I couldn't pass it up.  I got the chance to watch just a little of it (sadly, not all), but it was enough to make me want to read the children's book that it was based on.<br /><br />Coraline was a creepy read that I will definitely come back to in the future.  Maybe when I have children of my own, I will fill their Halloween nights with tales of the 'Other Mother', her eyes made of black buttons, skin the color of bone, alternate reality, and a talking black cat.  Oh...and a circus of mice.  I love it.
B004FQX59I|5.0|A must watch movie if your interested in what happened in Dallas when Kennedy was assinated. Garrison sure did his homework. So did the director of this film.
B004GCKRWY|3.0|I appreciate the risks that \\"Buried\\" took. Put your star in a box, self-lit with only a lighter, glow sticks, occasionally a flashlight and the screen of a phone. And stay there.   I think most movies would intercut the box-time with scenes from the search team, or the empty house of the family that star Ryan Reynolds keeps trying to call, or the ridiculously bureaucratic office that put the character in Iraq in the first place, but not this movie.  Reynolds is literally the face of this movie and he does a brilliant job. And I have to give a lot of credit to all the voice actors, including Robert Paterson and occasional \\"Glee\\" alum Stephen Tobolowsky, who manage to have just as much presence as Reynolds, despite being merely voices on the other end of the phone.  \\"Buried\\" also takes risks with the story, offering up several moments I would not have expected.  So I can appreciate what went into it. The acting is superb. The cinematography I think makes some odd choices that don't always work, but at the end it's still a movie filmed in a box, so I think there's some leeway on weird shots. The story is daring.  But there are also some downsides.    For all the heart and all the emotion and the gravity of the latter half the film, the first half actually strays into being kind of boring, and more than a little irritating to watch as buried Reynolds wave a lighter around his box -- especially when he's whipping it out to better see his cell phone, which, you know, is kind of bright all on its own.  I was streaming this, and in the first half, I nearly turned it off a few times but instead just opened a new window and did other things until the movie started to sound interesting again.  I mean, clearly it not only GOT interesting but got really good. I just don't think great movies should ever make me want to do other things out of boredom.  In short, this is a very dense movie for only being 95 minutes, and if that's your thing, you might enjoy it. But it's not a popcorn flick. If you just want something to watch while kicking back to relax on a Saturday afternoon, you probably want to look for something else.
0385534639|1.0|I feel like Erin Morgenstern kind of missed her calling. She'd make a fabulous art director. The circus she has imagined is going to look stunning on film. Let's just hope some gifted director will figure out how to bring life to her cardboard-like characters and tensionless plot.<br /><br />Granted, some readers are going to love her descriptions of the fantastical scenarios of said nocturnal circus. And if Morgenstern had either a good story or a talent for writing, she'd be solidly in 3- or 4-star territory with me. But she has neither of those things.<br /><br />First off: There is precious little in the way of story here, whether character-driven, plot-driven, or idea-driven. There is just nothing to these characters, likeable or unlikable. And the (alleged) plot! Those marketing blurbs that reference \\"a fierce competition,\\" \\"a game in which only one can be left standing,\\" and \\"the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will\\"--those are UNCONSCIONABLE LIES! Here's my proof: On a page that Kindle tells me is 54% of the way through the book, the central protagonists essentially agree that they have no conflict with one another: \\"Knowing that [Celia] thinks of the circus as an exhibition comes as a pleasant surprise, as [Marco] had stopped considering it antagonistic years ago.\\" I find this pretty insulting to the reader. You tell me there's really no conflict between two people who are supposed to be locked in a magical battle? And there hasn't been conflict for years? And the revelation itself is no more than a pleasant surprise?<br /><br />Oh, and that part about \\"only one can be left standing\\"? See, apparently the \\"duel\\" ends when one of the \\"combatants\\" dies. Which sounds exciting, except that they never actually battle. I might just as well claim that I, Amy Geneva, am locked in a magical duel with...I don't know, David Bowie. A duel that will end when one of us dies. And that claim will be every bit as true, AND just as meaningless, as the supposed battle described (endlessly, and tediously) in this book.<br /><br />Onward to my other major complaint, which is the astonishingly clunky writing. Gah! Yes, I said Gah! OK, so this is a first novel, and she's a young writer...still, I KNOW Doubleday had the budget for an editor, even after Morgenstern got her massive advance...and, in all seriousness, this is some brutally bad writing. No originality of usage, no fresh metaphors. If you're going to pack your book with flowery description, it should contribute to the plot, characterization, or themes. And the language itself ought to be beautiful. See, it's not enough to describe things as being sumptuous, intricate, and lovely if your prose is just...gross.<br /><br />Let's do a quick comparison of Junk Writing that Thinks It's Lovely and Lyrical (Sample A), vs. Junk Writing that Knows It's Junk and Is Therefore Funny (Sample B):<br /><br />Sample A<br />\\"She turns her head, Bailey catches her eye, and she smiles at him. Not in the way that one smiles at a random member of the audience when one is in the middle of performing circus tricks with unusually talented kittens but in the way that one smiles when one recognizes someone they have not seen in some time.\\"<br />--Erin Morgenstern, The Night Circus<br /><br />Sample B<br />\\"He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience, like a guy who went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it.\\"<br />--Attributed to Joseph Romm, winner of some kind of bad simile contest. (Or so sayeth the Interweb.)<br /><br />Do you see what I'm getting at here?<br /><br />I can overlook the occasional clumsy construction. It happens. But I found Morgenstern's prose almost nauseating, because I was constantly rewriting her sentences in my head while reading. How about some more examples, so you can share my pain? Let's examine the phrase \\"round spheres that resemble birdcages.\\" Cue gag reflex! Sorry, I wasn't aware that square spheres existed. Why not write \\"round cages\\"? Even \\"spherical cages\\" would be acceptable.<br /><br />Then there's \\"Normal chairs with legs and backs act as trapezes.\\" Um...in my world, normal chairs HAVE legs and backs. That said, exactly how are these normal chairs ACTING AS TRAPEZES? Has Morgenstern ever seen a trapeze? In my experience, they bear little resemblance to chairs. Now, this is a work of fantasy, and I am eager to believe in chairs that can act as trapezes. All I'm asking for is a little more detail. Unfortunately, those nine words are a paragraph unto themselves. There is absolutely no explanation of this hard-to-visualize occurrence. Disappointing.<br /><br />Here's another: \\"There is a considerable crowd outside when Herr Thiessen finally reaches the gates, and despite the crowd, he would have spotted his clock instantly, even without being informed of its placement.\\" I hope you understand why I feel this merits a \\"Gah!\\" because, frankly, I find it exhausting to untangle the mess of verb tense shift, spatial discontinuity, passive voice, and sheer wordiness plaguing this sentence.<br /><br />Here's a fun activity if you happen to be using an e-reader to slog through this book. Do a search on the phrase \\"for some time.\\" The list is both long and hilarious. With irritating vagueness, Morgenstern repeatedly forces her characters to stand in one place \\"for some time,\\" stare at one another \\"for some time,\\" or just sit silently \\"for some time.\\" Perhaps my standards are too high, but I like a book to contain some ideas or some action, if not both. In The Night Circus, a shocking number of sentences are being wasted on uninteresting non-action that lasts for indefinable periods of time. It's excruciatingly boring.<br /><br />So yeah. In the absence of compelling characters or a gripping plot, I found I was reading on just to see what egregious literary howler Morgenstern would commit next.<br /><br />I leave you with this revolting pile of words: \\"After dinner, the conversation continues over coffee and brandy in the parlor, until an hour most of the guests deem extremely late but Tsukiko points out that it is comparatively early for the circus girls.\\" (And yes, I typed that exactly as printed.)

0812550706|5.0|Although it has been several years since I read these books, I can still remember the emotion it evoked. I wish there were more series like this.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|I tried to see this in Australia but it wound up pretty quickly in the theatres providing virtually no opportunity to view it cinematically.. one of the downsides of living in a country still slavering over so-called British history and a bit limited when it comes to other history. Anyway, I found this disc to be excellent, I initially thought it was a travesty what happened but then found myself questioning that after a few days, suggesting that Mr Redford has hit the mark by sparking thought rather than laying down an opinion.  I love the American Revolution so look forward to some other things that the American Film company has in the works!!  Thoroughly recommended!!
0545265355|5.0|This is a great series. I can't wait for the movie release of the first book. If it's half as good as the book I will be happy.
B000UR9QGW|3.0|This movie was made like in the 90's..so I know, you really can make something shot not in high def and  transfer it to bluray and expect it to be in high def..it's not possible..I knew that! I just bought it in bluray disc because it's supposed to be anti scratch disc. And besides, I like funny horror film.
0345529057|5.0|Really enjoyed these books even though the last one was a little tedious. To many new characters and not very interesting at that.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|I gave it four - but that was a positive four.  My spouse hated it, but she hates Paranomal Activity one and two and \\"Blair\\" - all movies like that.  I don't mind them and the mock rammifications of this sort of \\"documentary gone wrong\\" style actually helps the storyline.  Nutshell - I just thought it was a very fun film, will re-watch often, and I was VERY impressed with the Troll designs on a smaller (I assume?)budget - I rented first, watched twice, and bought it for my home collection as it was a film I'll drop in now and again for some just plain good old entertainment.

B0051CSIKQ|5.0|First - loved it. Finally we have a film that is both well done, well (very) acted and filmed with an eye on the reality of what the world would be like in this type of global situation. I like vamp films of all types, but my heart is reserved for the old \\"Varney the Vampire\\" penny dreadfuls out of the long past or the old latin works of Father Summers (english translations  can be bought) of \\"The Vampire: His Kith and Kin\\" - back when they did not have Euro-speak, were not sensitive or sensual - they were animated dead creatures that had no interest in talking or writing diaries etc - just Deadly things that wanted your blood, any blood, adult or infant. Demons on two feet that you ran from or killed outright - not that you engaged in chat-rooms with.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Great unit.  Easy setup.  I would defiantly recommend these headphones...you can actually hear the small details you miss out on.  You can hear enemies coming.  This is worlds better than a bluetooth setup.  Only downside is the corded setup and the length of cord from the headset to the controller could be longer...there is a clip that you can attach it to your shirt.  Love that you can change game sound....chat sound...and all the other settings.
B0058RN85O|5.0|My review of Modern Family was totally non-biased as I have never watched this show before. Originally I had wanted to, but just never set aside time. I was very excited to review the Modern Family Complete Second Season. I was immediately drawn to this funny crazy cast of characters in the Modern Family series. Gloria (Sof&iacute;a Vergara), is a blast, and since she is Colombian on the show and I am Hispanic, my Latin blood can relate to many of what goes on with her on the show. Gloria is loud just as many Latin woman are and I could totally relate to her feelings when Jay (Ed O'Neill), her husband mocks her or makes fun of her accent. One of the funnier episodes has Gloria ordering those tiny cheeses that she calls baby cheeses. Unfortunately for her and Jay, when the order arrives it contained baby Jesus's instead of cheeses. Manny (Rico Rodriguez), the 11 year old son of Gloria, is a quirky little character who drinks many cups of espresso daily. Manny drinking espresso was something I did not find unusual, since Hispanics allow children to drink coffee, but my husband thought it to be insane. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), the grown son of Jay, lives with his partner Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) and their adopted Vietnamese daughter. The two men are total opposites. Mitchell is the sensitive one who stays home, and Cameron is the provider who always seems to get his way. One of my favorite episodes with Mitchell and Cameron is where Mitchell has found a new fashion, wearing bicycle shorts and Cameron does not have the heart to tell him how bad they look and that he should stop wearing them. My husband and I both roared throughout all the episodes! We now need to back track and watch season one, as we would love to see how these quirky characters all came to be. We are now hooked on Modern Family and are now permanent fans of this great series! I also loved watching all the extras on the disc, the deleted family interviews, extended and deleted scenes, the hilarious gag reel and the music video. I give this Modern Family Complete Season Blu-ray 3-Disc set 5 stars all the way.ious gag reel and the music video. I give this Modern Family Complete Season Blu-ray 3-Disc set 5 stars all the way.
0385737947|4.0|When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his first name. His memory is blank. But he's not alone. When the lift's doors open, Thomas finds himself surrounded by kids who welcome him to the Glade--a large, open expanse surrounded by stone walls.   Just like Thomas, the Gladers don't know why or how they got to the Glade. All they know is that every morning the stone doors to the maze that surrounds them have opened. Every night they've closed tight. And every 30 days a new boy has been delivered in the lift.   Thomas was expected. But the next day, a girl is sent up--the first girl to ever arrive in the Glade. And more surprising yet is the message she delivers.   Thomas might be more important than he could ever guess. If only he could unlock the dark secrets buried within his mind.     Blurb from Barnes and Nobel.com    4 out of 5 stars    (the extra picture came up when I googled the book, and it's the original cover)    This book was so scary! I didn't really expect all of the nightmarish stuff to be in a book about mazes, but it was there.    It took me awhile to get used to Thomas, and reading about him, because at first, I didn't really like him. But like I said, I got used to him. :)    The only thing that really bothered me in the beginning was that this book is told in third person. I don't read a lot of books like that, so it took me awhile to get used to hearing the story like that. After awhile, I didn't even notice it.    This book was way better than I thought it would be. I thought it would be really good, but the start didn't really give me high hopes. I don't really know what it was, but the first pages just didn't strike me as well as the rest of the book did.    For me, this book constantly had me thinking. I was always trying to solve the maze, find a way out, think of a new way the Gladers hadn't. I would also guess over and over on theories about why the Gladers were there and why. And over and over I was proven wrong, which just made me want to read more.    Top it all off with a brutally cliff hanger ending, and I already upset that I don't have the second one, and I finished this one an hour or so ago.    Can't wait!

0385738765|4.0|The Scorch Trials picks up where The Maze Runner left off. The Gladers have escaped the Maze, but now they face an even more treacherous challenge on the open roads of a devastated planet.  And WICKED has made sure to adjust the variables and stack the odds against them.  Can Thomas survive in such a violent world?     Blurb from Barnes and Nobel.com    4 out of 5    A wonderful continuation to a scary series! This book was one of those where you think somethings a lie, and then it's the truth, and then it's a lie again, over and over untill you don't know up from down, and then you've still got to keep going.    I wasn't quiet sure where the Gladers were going when The Maze Runner ended, and I didn't believe that I could be worse than the maze and everything else they faced.    It was worse.    This book was scary in the way that makes you want to throw up, and in the mental kind of scary, the scary that mess's up your head.    And of course, this book had about the worst cliff-hanger ever written.    Of course.    So, I will be eagerly and impatently waiting for the third one. :)    If you would like to read more of my reviews, please visit my website.  [...]

B002I0J5FG|4.0|All i can say is \\"WOW!\\" to this amazing collection. Theses games individually were an awesome experience by themselves, but now that they are together and better than ever with the enhanced digital imagery, it makes it all the more awesome! I'll start off with shadow of the colossus. If you thought that the visuals of this game on the ps2 before were great, then you'll be shocked to see them now on the ps3. Everything has gotten a lot more detailed and vivid. The graphical enhancement really does add to the overall experience of the game. For the game play, nothing much has really changed, everything is just as it was before, so there are no complaints about changes in the story or the game itself. As for the ICO, there is one qualm I had, and that was the water wheel. It seems that they've made some changes to this segment of the game which really frustrated me. Anyway, at the part where you have to jump on the water wheel and from there to the bar, it seems to be almost impossible for I have tried a countless amount of times. The rest of the game is fine and has a few tweaks from the original, but this really stood out to me in a bad way. Some things are better off untouched. Other than that, the game is just as fun as it was before. So that about sums up my review. Overall i thought this collection was great and well worth it and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great action/adventure gaming experience.<br /><br />Please leave a positive vote if you found this review helpful. Thanks

0385534639|5.0|When I was young I would listen with great anticipation to \\"Let's Pretend\\". I used  my imagination visually with \\"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\\", Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk\\".  Decades later I get to use my imagination again with this book. Each page had a  magical energy and I found myself only reading it at nightfall since that's when the circus appears.  I won't find one like this for a long time to come.
1594202710|5.0|Rarely have I turned the last page of a book and, without any conscious thought say, \\"phenomenal.\\"  That was my reaction to this broad and insightful text on China.  At 530 pages this book may look intimidating, but the writing is clear, captivating and compelling, and although it may take a few days to read, this is hardly a dense or unfriendly text.  Dr. Kissinger takes us through 40 years of US diplomatic history with China.  But this is not just about the history (fascinating as it is); understanding the background that led China to its current status is extremely useful as a going forward exercise.  I recommend this book without reservation to anyone who does or anticipates doing business with China, to anyone who wants to understand the pre-eminent diplomatic focus that faces the next generation or two of Americans, and to anyone who believes it is important to learn from history.   To that last point:  in his introductory chapter, \\"The Singularity of China,\\" Dr. Kissinger provides the cultural context with which to consider interactions with the Chinese.  In so doing, he also points out an important topic to keep in mind for American foreign relations:  when we think about interactions with other governments, we use chess as the metaphor.  \\"[chess] is about total victory.  The purpose of the game is checkmate, to put the opposing king into a position where he cannot move without being destroyed.\\"  In contrast, \\"China's most enduring game\\" is wei qi, approximately pronounced way chee.  \\"The wei qi player seeks relative advantage.  ... wei qi generates strategic flexibility.\\"  Dr. Kissinger relates this thinking to Sun Tzu's guidance on strategy:  \\"A successful commander waits before charging headlong into battle.  ... a doctrine less of territorial conquest than of psychological dominance...\\"  Independent of political view, consider this way of thinking in the context of the continued US presence in both Iraq and Afganistan; the classroom study question mightbe, how would a wei qi -oriented policy differ -- or would it?  Another topic that is quite current and relevant to American foreign policy today is the tension between America's belief it has the moral imperative to tell other nations (and thus cultures) how to run their sovereign nations, and China's irreducible commitment, born of its history of interaction with British and other colonial interests in the past couple of hundred years, to not be bullied by other nations.  As Dr. Kissinger paints it, an unfortunate event such as Tienamen Square (where in 1989 protesters were forcibly, i.e., violently removed, and more importantly, in full view of the cameras of the world press) is viewed by the Chinese government as only that:  an unfortunate event.  In the eyes of the US, it is viewed as a fundamental failure of human rights.   As a consequence, Americans tend to engage in social re-engineering diplomacy, trying to tie trade agreements to changes in China's internal structure.  China's view is to simply reject meddling in their domestic affairs as meddling, and to point out that the US doesn't have its own house in order with regard to human rights.   So if you were a Chinese government official, you'd observe the unprovoked US invasions of Iraq or Afghanistan (especially given that the weapons of mass destruction story was not accurate) and translate Congress' hard line oratory as a literal risk of war.  Consider Liu Mingfu's \\"China Dream:  the great power thinking and strategic positioning of China in the post-American age,\\" just briefly referenced by Dr Kissinger.  Colonel Liu (as I understand it) suggests that war can be avoided if the US can stifle its hegemonic aspirations.  One must rely on English language analysis of Liu's writing, see perhaps Cheng Li's \\"China in the Year 2020: three political scenarios,\\" at the Brookings Institute, or Christopher Hughes' \\"In Case You Missed It:  China dream,\\" in The China Beat.)  The point is, to China, appearances matter, and events as simple as President Obama meeting with the Dali Lama can be viewed as attempted interference with China's domestic policy.   To put this into context, imagine a group in the US, proposing that a part of the country secede from the Union.  How would President Lincoln have interpreted a cheerful meeting in Beijing between Jefferson Davis and the Chinese head of state?  Yes, I know:  the Dali Lama is the very image of pacifism, and recently retired from his role as the head of Tibet to focus entirely on his religious leadership role.  But to the Chinese government, the parallels may be considerable.  My only complaint about this book is that the epilogue seemed too brief and too imprecise:  Dr. Kissinger imagines a \\"Pacific community\\" (for example, see Lee Kwan Yew's writing on the toic) but doesn't clearly articulate the implications, including national self-interest values (to the US).    All in all though, a small complaint about an extraordinary work from one of the finest minds of American diplomacy in action.
0375850864|4.0|I am a college student taking a young adult literature class, and \\"When You Reach Me\\" was one of the books we were required to read. \\"When You Reach Me\\" is a book about a 12 year old girl named Miranda. Miranda is very mature for age; you will see this in the way she interacts with people, and the street smarts she has obtained from her mother. Her mother is a single parent raising her daughter in New York City. Miranda has a really good friend named Sal. Miranda and Sal's friendship drastically changes over a random incident. Which leads Miranda to new, and somewhat different friendships. The story takes a turn when she suddenly receives random notes. These notes scare her at first, but eventually she realizes the importance of them. How it all ends out is rather unexpected. This book will keep you guessing. I must say I really liked reading this book. It was a fun read, and made me think. I would recommend this book to anyone especially young adults. The book shows real life situations, that may be beneficial to a growing teen. If your looking for a fun mystery, then read this one.
B0055PMJMW|2.0|I won't further elaborate on what the other reviewers have already stated about this not being up to Connelley's standards, though I agree. I might have been able to overlook that, after all nobody can be at the top of their game all the time, and well Bosch is still Bosch and always worth the read.  However, I finished this book in under 30 minutes, not just one story...the book. These weren't short stories, they were barely longer than an average book description.  What was really bad was that 1/4 of the entire book is a preview for \\"The Drop\\".  I don't want to just read a couple of chapters of a book and then wait another two months to continue.

B00457WZEI|4.0|This is the book upon which the current theatrical production is based. A moving and warmly written story. Even though the use of first person narrative to tell the Horse's saga seems a bit contrived at first, the reader is quickly drawn into the action.<br /><br />Although a children's book, the author uses some advanced words and is very correct on the military terminology for the period. While not overly graphic, the descriptions of WW1 combat are stark and to the point. Cavalry was virtually useless during much of the war, and the author is very correct in noting that troopers dismounted to use their carbines in most actions. The fabled cavalry charges described here very quickly went out of vogue after the first few months of 1914!<br /><br />I would have liked if the author had placed our hero horse in a real British cavalry regiment like the 4th Dragoon Guards or 11th Hussars for example.  But this is just a minor point.  The author just wanted our horse to represent the plight of all such animals in the Great War of 1914-18.  He does just that.  Throughout history the horse has fought with nobility and power, yet without malice.  Quite in contrast to humans!<br /><br />All in all a great read for both Adults and Children. Kids who know nothing about WW1 (and that's most of them these days!) will get a good basic idea of what the conditions were like from reading this book. This is a story about the British Cavalry in WW1 which I find amazing that off B'way here in NYC has not changed over to make as Americans instead!  Nice that the Germans are not vilified, and that most characters are real people and not obvious good or bad types.  In its own way a nice  a companion to the classic \\"All Quiet on the Western front\\".  Recommended for all ages.

B003FVI2KQ|5.0|I'm in no way biased toward AMD since I had my share of both Intel and AMD chips over last 10 years and my main desktop runs on SB i5 2500k that overclocks effortlessly to 5.0 Ghz when needed (hardly:) just for benchmarking). Viewed on its own terms and especially price, this processor is a truly multitasking powerhouse and offers great bang for the buck, plus that X-factor of 6 cores in Win Task Manager - priceless:) However, its truly \\"killer\\" feature is a new lease of life for my aging MSI K9A2 Platinum MB and 4 GB Mushkin Black Series DDR2 that were once top of the line but were shelved for almost a year:) The update process was extremely simple - just a BIOS update with an old chip - drop in this one - off we go!  Moderate load temps never exceed 31-32 C in a rather cramped case with no fans, however my cooling solution is far better than stock (old but good Revoltec tower)/ Overclocking then - like all AMD black editions, overclocking is very straightforward: just up the multiplier to x18 and 3.6 Ghz is rock-solid on stock volts. Can go higher if I play a bit but feel no need since it already screams, just good to know that there is some headroom left.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the performance of this processor and considering that it saved me loads of money by being backwards-compatible with K9A2 and DDR2, extending their life-cycle for at least a year - well, 5 stars honestly earned.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|To all who trusted George RR Martin, let this be your warning.  This book doesn't finish the saga, you will seethe with disgust when the book draws to a close.  At the end of \\"Feast for Crows,\\"  Martin apologizes to the reader, claiming that there was simply too much story to complete the tome in a single volume.  He promised the conclusion in a year, he said the audience would not be put off.<br /> Five years later the new book comes to print, and is purchased by the thousands.  But the author lied, this story is not done, not a single issue is resolved, only many heroes and a few villains slain.<br /><br />This author deceives us all, and I warn you not to fall into his trap.  There is no end to this series, only more and more complex plots, more characters and more teases.  Martin expands upon minor characters only to apparently grow bored, many chapters in, and slaughters them capriciously.  While I grant that Martin has a great gift he abuses us, he has no intention of completing this story.  It is his cash cow, his career - he has no respect for the reader.<br /><br />I beg of you to NOT purchase this book.  Martin does not deserve your patronage, he is a liar, and believes the reader to be a fool.
0142419400|3.0|\\"Here is everything I know about France: Madeline and Am&eacute;lie and Moulin Rouge. The Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, although I have no idea what the function of either actually is. Napoleon, Marie Antoinette, and a lot of kings with the name Louis. I'm not sure what they did either, but I think it has something to do with the French Revolution, which has something to do with Bastille Day.\\"<br /><br />Thus begins Anna and the French Kiss; the witty tale of Anna, a rich little poor girl, whose daddy - an author with a formulaic plot that usually involves people falling in love, contracting a life-threatening diseases and dying - sends her to Paris for school, to impress his wealthy friends.<br /><br />Anna doesn't want to be shipped away to Paris during her senior year, so, in true teenage spirit,* she throws a tantrum; a rather useless one as the story opens up with Anna in Paris, knowing next to nothing about the place in which she has to spend an entire year. She is a girl of privilege, attending a prestigious school in a city that many people love, yet she doesn't try to learn anything useful about her new home, I found this slightly disturbing.<br /><br />The biggest thing Anna has going for her is her wit and her funny narrative, which makes her character endearing. I think, without these, she might have come off a bit abrasive.<br /><br />Through Anna, we are introduced to her new friends and love interest - &Eacute;tienne, who is suppose to be shorter than Anna, even though she mistakes him for a wall when she walks into him in the very beginning of the story. We are also introduced to the school, then slowly to Paris, when Anna is practically dragged from the dorms by &Eacute;tienne for a night around town.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins isn't very descriptive in Anna's exploration of Paris; and while it is primarily a love story, a little more description of Paris would have been perfect; after-all, it is the City of Love. We do, however, get to see a lot of &Eacute;tienne's hair, and eyes, and the things he says and the strange things he does.<br /><br />I found it a little ironic that Anna's story contained similar elements as her father's bestseller novels (which she hated). Anna and the French Kiss is a book for the hopeless romantic, unfortunately, I'm not a hopeless romantic, but if you are you'll definitely enjoy the witty prose.<br /><br />*generalization of coursend the strange things he does.

Rachel is a ordinary but smart lawyer who falls in love with her classmate Dex in law school.  Rachel was too scared to tell him how she felt. Darcy happens to be the complete opposite of Rachel.  Dex falls for Darcy and they get engaged.  Even though Rachel is  Darcy's maid of honor, she doesn't have the heart to tell Dex how she still feels about him.  When Darcy throws a surprise party for Rachel.  She gets a little drunk and finally blurts it out to Dex.  Little did she know he felt the same for her.  Dex and Rachel spends the night together.  They try to forget it  and get on with their life.  But Ethan one or Rachel's close friend tries to convince her that life is too short and go after the guy she truly loves.

B00466HN86|5.0|Once again, the Kendricks brothers have delivered and shown Hollywood that movies that speak of issues that matter can be made.  I laughed (one scene was totally hilarious), I cried at the multiple scenes of intense, heartfelt drama and heartache, and I kept wondering what was going to happen next with scenes of nonstop action and twists and turns that took you off guard.  This movie focuses on fathers and the impact they can have in the life of a child, I would strongly suggest it is also beneficial for teens; boys will see what should be expected of them when they become men and fathers, and girls will realize they deserve to be respected and they deserve to expect more of the boys they date.  For us ladies, it shows us how not to give up on the husbands and fathers who have not lived up to being a good role model in the family, and trust me, some of us can see ourselves in the failings as well.  And of course for fathers, it brings it right at you to challenge you to really look at yourself and the family life you are in charge of, are you just going through the motions to try to be a \\"good enough\\" Dad or do you want to be what you were called to be by God, the leader and the love your children deserve?  This movie so wonderfully shows that honor does indeed begin at home, and seeing this film will make you truly realize this.
0439796644|4.0|I bought this book not really knowing it was a children's book. It is a short read for an adult, but the story is very compelling and well-written. For an animal lover, it is a great read as the story is narrated by the farm horse, later war horse, and provides a unique perspective on family, war, national identity, and friendship. I was brought to tears more than once as it's a very moving story. I think my 13 year old niece will love it!
B0058WFO06|5.0|Grace For Drowning isn't an easy album to digest. It takes several intense listening sessions before one gets to the core. However, in my opinion it's the journey itself what makes this album such a treat. All the musical layers, different atmospheres and the lush arrangements serve one single purpose, namely to simply amaze its listeners. The pristine production by Wilson himself, does the rest.
B001EN1R2M|5.0|Love love love this album....have it on vinyl, cassette and cd. Best Crue ever! Come on and Dace and Live Wire are two of my favorites. Played it for my daughter who \\"knows everything about Nikki Sixx\\" and she had no idea who it was.

This third one, for me at least, comes very close to being as good or better than the first one.  I was very pleased and recommend it to anyone.  Hope you enjoy it!!

B004J4WKTW|2.0|I'm absolutely perplexed here... where has all the of the hype surrounding this book come from? I've never felt compelled to write a review for anything on Amazon before, and I may not again. But I have to add my input here because I feel completely confused by all the newspaper reviews and the media praise surrounding this book's release. I was dazzled by the excitement, so I bought this after obtaining a sample on my Kindle, and was convinced it would be an entertaining story based on that short passage. But as a few other reviewers mentioned, the story completely falters after those beginning chapters.  The author seems driven to the point of obsession with visual descriptions, which are extremely beautiful and sensory. I was entranced with some of the scenery, fragrances, sounds, and effects. The author should have extended these carefully rendered details to her characters, but instead she leaves the reader with a superficial impression of every single character in the book. As I continued to read, I hoped I might warm to any of the characters, but there is really nothing to care about.   ***Spoiler***  The two main characters, Celia and Marco, could have been stamped out of any number of different genres that feature a sodden romance. Their dialogue, connection, and passion are tepid and uninspired at best. They bleat at one another, first in a failed effort to establish some tension and distrust between the two, later in sudden, unaccountable declarations of love. The only qualities each are enraptured of in the other? Their \\"magical\\" abilities, skills, talents, or whatever you choose to call it.   Marco is sly and weak. He uses his first interest, Isobel, without offering more than a token apology. His employer, Chandresh, is also swept aside in Marco's quest to achieve his ends. Marco uses Chandresh for over a decade, living in his home, dolling out his money, etc. Finally the day comes when a now alcoholic Chandresh confronts his employee, and what does the valiant Marco do? Mess with Chandresh's mind (which has already taken a few reality hits) and hand him another bottle of liquor. I'm sorry but how am I supposed to hope for this man to actually have a happy ending with his love interest?   Not that his love interest is much better. Celia is a ragdoll, happy to take verbal abuse from her father, content to lie to anyone and everyone, and ready to be a pawn in the game she's thrown into. Poor, downtrodden Celia. Her finger hurts when she tries to break free from her commitment, so obviously she shouldn't pursue as many means of escape as possible. No, she should just start weaving her noose right now.   Mind you, neither of the two lovers take extreme measures to try and break away from their entrapment. They simply continue to make grand gestures within the confines of their environment. Both Celia and Marco allow most of their important choices to be made for them. Celia cries to her father to free her because she loves Marco, Marco cries to his caretaker to free him because he loves Celia. And that's it.   These are pretty characters who live in a remarkably pretty world with only an awkward attempt at mystery and drama to keep the story plowing along. The dialogue feels very immature despite the attempts to disguise it as intellectual and restrained. Many times I felt like it was plucked from a soap opera. There's no real fight to the death here. The opponents simply create homages to the other while driving themselves insane until one or the other decides to commit suicide apparently. Or unless one of them just caves, concedes, hands the other a \\"you're better than I am\\" badge? Mystical and romantic. Really.  The pace of the entire book flows sedately, never altering its rhythm. There's no climax or compulsive page-turning appeal. I held on as long as I did because I hate leaving a book unfinished, and also because I clung to the hope that a spectacular ending was waiting in the wings.   At the end, many of thecharacters tumble into their situations through no choice of their own, simply handed their future with a bright red bow and they all simply accept it. The circus has killed two people, driven a few mad, caused torment to a variety of characters, but it's pretty and mystical. There's no real repercussions for any of the characters who purposely cause death and torment. All of the circus's members are supporting players for Celia and Marco, entrapped by this alternate reality, yet those that are aware of it don't seem to truly mind. Even Isobel, someone who could reasonably be forgiven for striking out at either Marcus or Celia, cannot possibly do anything or hate anyone because Celia is \\"nice.\\" Marco and Celia TRULY love each other, so Isobel walks away with a \\"hey, Marco, be happy because you deserve it\\" attitude. The circus is \\"home\\" to its members, so they, too, are ok with staying within its world and serving Marco and Celia's love affair. And the reason behind this game is absolutely absurd and superficial as well. The manner in which Marco and Celia's story is concluded is truly awful. This has been done before, and much better.  Despite most of the flaws, this does have a light charm. Mainly in the aforementioned descriptive passages. But it feels like a decorative story at best. I can see how a movie could create some stunning visuals with this, but good luck with the characters.
0345472322|4.0|Overall, I thought the message was good. I've caught myself constantly re-assessing my mindset after reading the book. There are some sections that feel like I'm being sold something on an info-mercial. Overall, very good read.

B005D9MUWY|3.0|This keyboard has too many quirks. It stalls a lot, especially when I turn the phone to the side to use the larger key. It also goes into a weird dup  mode I could never understand, where it repeats the word I am trying to delete.  Very frustrating. Better than the stardard Android keyboard that came with the phone. The Thumb Keyboard 4 is a better choice.

B004P8JPS6|2.0|It appears Lee Childs now has an annual book contract, and he waited until the last minute to write The Affair.  This is not a Jack Reacher novel.  Pretty boring; with some obvious twist, and only one surprise.....The book sucks.  There are so many holes in the story line that it would be a decent Swiss cheese.  Now I hear that Tom Cruise thinks he can pull off being  a midget Jack Reacher.  Lee....enjoy the money, but give us back Jack Reacher!

B0033PQUXA|1.0|[[ASIN:B002BB702M Cinema Paradiso [1989] [Blu-ray]]]  RIP-OFF ALERT!!! I just canceled my order upon learning that this is the American Theatrical version and not the Director's Cut. Shame on Lions Gate for releasing the HACKED shorter version instead of the longer Director's Cut on a 50GB BD. They will probably try and double dip by releasing the shorter version first and the the longer (I just won't fall for it) You are better off buying the two-disc deluxe edition DVD and enjoy the film as it was meant to be. Don't be a fool and wait for the longer/better Director's Cut.

1559277734|4.0|The key thing to understand is this book/audio is much darker than the TV series.  Herriot's clients are mostly animals in labour with various ghastly problems. Somehow hearing about them rather than seeing tame simulations, greatly amplifies the gross out factor.<br /><br />The farmers don't give the young vet any respect, and it really grates on him.  It is almost as though he wrote the book for revenge.<br /><br />Timothy Christopher the reader is amazing.  He creates a distinct voice for each character, including Mrs. Pumphrey, Tricki Poo's companion (reminiscent of the  Amy De La Pompa character on The Royal Canadian Air Farce).  He does all kinds of Yorkshire accents that sound right on -- at least to my ear weaned on British TV.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the show and this season pack it soooo good!! It is great quality and I recommend it to everyone that loves a really good from the gut laugh!! I have seen this season like 10 times and i still can't stop watching it!
B005EXA8XC|5.0|Basically, if you are into Nirvana you'll want this.  I think it's a better, tighter performance than the Live at Reading (which is also great).  Especially Cobain, who was a bit more slack on the Reading performance (off-key vocals sometimes, wrong guitar notes sometimes). I got the regular DVD, not the Blu-Ray, so there is no problem with the sync.  This is probably the best live DVD I own, along with the 2003 Alison Krauss/Union Station performance.

I think  everyone should see this movie and then go to [live stream . com / global revolution] to see what is happening TODAY in our own Nation and around the world. Unlike V in the movie those that are involved in the Global Revolution are acting in a nonviolent manner to make changes with what is wrong in our world. It is time to wake up from the deep slumber that we have all been in and see things for what they are just as they did in this movie. Don't let fear keep your eyes shut.

0385534639|5.0|I really liked and enjoyed this book, but I'm not sure why. Which I think makes sense in a strange sort of way, because that's the kind of book it is. The story told, as well as the characters in it, are both real and unreal. In its style and content, this novel appeals to that innate awareness--sometimes conscious but mostly not--that awareness we all have that there is something in our existence, in our lives, that we're missing. Something beneath the surface or behind the reality we touch and see. Naturalists would dismiss this feeling as psychological phenomena, and nothing more. I don't. As to the nature of that \\"missing\\" or \\"hidden\\" reality, well, that's what religion and philosophy deal with. I do not necessarily \\"believe\\" that life is as it is portrayed in this book. Nevertheless I found it fascinating to take a journey through the make-believe and let my mind glimpse and ponder the possible similarities to realities of which I may or may not be aware, and which I may or may not understand.   One other aspect of the story that makes it relatable is the underlying question of how much of what happens to us is out of our control, maybe in ways we are completely unaware of. Regardless of what one believes about the supernatural, magic, etc., this question is one that deep down inside begs our attention and consideration. It's one of those questions that has to be faced, even if it cannot be fully answered, in our pursuit of understanding the meaning of our lives.
0385534639|2.0|This book seemed to have everything I personally love, late 19th century setting, a circus, illusionists, and a duel. For the first 50 or so pages, I was very interested. Halfway through, I was wondering what was missing, or what was wrong. By the end, I had buyer's remorse (should've waited for paperback...). I was drawn to this novel partially because it was NOT advertised as YA, yet if I picked this up without knowing its genre, I'd have easily pinned it as YA for reasons that I list in the Cons section.   This review is long, but I couldn't help but be frustrated about this novel after finishing it (and like I said, buyer's remorse).  POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT  PROS:  - Setting and Description: Erin Morgenstern creates a circus that most readers (including myself) will want to go to. Her writing and description of every setting in the book was very well written and never got too lengthy. I personally enjoyed her description of Widget's tent of bottles to be my favorite, as well as the brief descriptions of her guiding the reader through the circus. She creates a very lush and interesting world, sometimes too perfect to be taken seriously (this IS turn of the century London, they were not exclusively made of cafes and richly-furnished flats). Also: if I had to read one more description about one of Celia's endless amount of dresses and how beautiful it was, I was about to throw the book.  - Premise: The overall idea of the novel is difficult not to find interesting if a reader enjoys historical fiction, fantasy, or romance. In a world where  most best-sellers either include vampires, werewolves, or anything of the like, Morgenstern's novel is a breath of fresh air even if you didn't necessarily like the book.   CONS:  - Magic: The summary of this novel talks about a competition, illusionists, and what goes on \\"behind the smoke and mirrors\\". Personally, I thought that this implied that there would be no actual \\"magic\\" in this book, just illusion. Yet tea cups and other random junk gets broken all the time just to be instantly restored. Celia, a main character, talks about being able to heal herself and others with magic on several occasions. As I read through the book, the idea of magic in this novel became less intriguing and more like a deus ex machina. A side character realizes something important about one of the main characters? That's ok, wipe their memory with magic. Want to stay alive for thousands of years? Do it with magic. It seems like one of the novel's main features is the one thing that keeps it from making any sense. This is one of the novel's features that makes me believe that it's more suited as YA. If performing magic had any sort of consequence towards its users, it would've balanced out a lot of the problems of this book. In Morgenstern's novel, illusion isn't just playing tricks on a person's mind, it's creating and fixing tangible things with no consequence. The fact that so many main characters are magicians (I'm sorry- illusionists) while the properties of magic are NEVER explained is frustrating.    - The Duel: Straight out, there is never any true explanation as to why Prospero and Alexander are having this competition. If Prospero and Alexander's motives were revealed to just be \\"we were bored\\" and they loved to toy with people would have sufficed (would've been amusing, too). By the end of the novel, their intentions are still very vague and still give no true insight of their motives (which is a shame, because they would have made much more interesting characters). While the idea of the duel was intriguing at first, by the time any important details are given about it, you're well more than halfway through the book. It seems like the game is meant to just be the conduit for Marco and Celia's eventual romance. The nature of the competition is kept in the dark for too long and makes it easy for a reader to stop caring.  - Romance: Another selling point of the book is its inevitable romance between two characters that are pitted against each other before they even meet. Yet the romance between Marco and Celia is very superficial, having been created out of their \\"instant attraction\\" that occurs when they first see each other and feel their magical powers (or something like that. As previously noted, I have NO idea how magic worked in this novel...). They don't go through any important character development together besides Celia saying \\"We can't be together\\" and Marco not being able to keep his hands away from her waist (did anyone else catch that?). Overall, I was not convinced that they were experiencing true love, but that foolish young-love that is romanticized and legitimized in story-telling because \\"They were meant to be together! Nothing else matters!\\"   - Characters: No one ever really went through major character development throughout this story, except maybe Bailey. Celia and Marco were nonsensically  different from their young incarnations at the beginning of the novel to their sappy, romantic adult versions. For example: How did Celia start as a shy, scared little girl who witnessed her mother's suicide (and was most probably verbally abused by her father) turn into the young woman who had perfect social graces and no trace of her noted temper. Celia's adult incarnate took major plot developments as only a cardboard cutout could, and it was very disappointing. Marco also had minimal development, especially when his relationship with Alexander called for so much (Marco was his favorite student? Really? Never noticed). No major characters were fleshed out, and important development between them was left to the reader's imagination.   To be honest, this novel could be shortened by about 50-100 pages easily and the plot would be the exact same. Other issues that the novel suffers from are stereotypes, lengthy unnecessary dialogue, and potential confusion in the timeline. The novel has received MANY glowing, positive reviews so for most, it does live up to its hype. But if you prefer lengthy character development over lengthy setting and clothing descriptions, I'd suggest picking a different novel.
B005HSL626|4.0|The different sounds for slicing different fruits are great! There is a bug during play on my samsung charge, the fruits sometimes stop in mid-stream.
B005LAZIRY|4.0|It's weird, but the thing that kind of tipped me off to this album possibly being a more conservative effort than usual was when the album art was revealed.  Usually there is some kind of dark, brooding, somewhat haunting image that carries with the overall tone of Opeth's work, so I can't say I was shocked upon seeing this cover that it foretold of something different; possibly something that won't be as heavy as I or most people would be used to.  Going past the piano solo title track, \\"Devil's Orchid\\" is a pretty \\"Opeth\\" song through and through.  Heavy guitars, double bass drums (there ain't much of that either).  It took me awhile to get past how towards the end, the guitar solo builds up a fervor only to just abruptly end.  This kind of disjointed song structure is what made me very apprehensive with \\"Watershed\\".  After a few listens, though, I've grown to really love this track.  Once past \\"Slither\\" (a short, different, but upbeat rock tune), the album almost turns into, I dare say, something close to jazz/prog-fusion at times.  \\"Haxprocess\\" has a great flute/organ breakdown that's VERY Jethro Tull.  Probably on purpose as per the concept of the album.    \\"Lines in my Hand\\" is another shorter song but features fantastic acoustic guitar, awesome bass,  some amazing drum work towards the end.   None of the critique above is really a negative on Åkerfeldt's part.  As many have said, you probably won't digest this the first few times through.  My actual negative comes in the way of the recording.  While perhaps done on purpose, I personally feel the lo-fi sound quality only does this music an injustice.  The drums really sound as if there was one mic placed OUTSIDE of the recording booth for tracking.  Even with \\"Damnation\\" being a stripped down Opeth, there were still layers of sound to pick through due to the excellent recording and mixing quality.  \\"Heritage\\" has a very murky sound quality that feels like it's being buried.  It's honestly the first thing thathit me when I first listened.  Getting adjusted to a different sound is one thing.  Primitive recording quality is nigh impossible to shake...concept or not.   And to everyone saying this is \\"Åkerfeldt's solo album\\".  Åkerfeldt is Opeth.  He gives a nod to the wonderful musicians that make up the band, but they are still performing his vision and his music.  And it's sad when people can't face the reality that a band is going to do something new.    \\"Heritage\\"  is much like \\"Damnation\\" in the very non-metal direction of the music, but also it's very different in the overall feel.  \\"Damnation\\" is a very brooding, morose, ethereal project in terms of the music and vocals, whereas \\"Heritage\\" is a much more upbeat, exploratory side to Åkerfeldt's writing.    Overall, I honestly like \\"Heritage\\" way better than \\"Watershed\\".  Åkerfeldt had a more concise sound in mind with this album.  And while I do miss the death metal side,  I appreciate the need to branch out and do something different with your craft.  It's certainly an album geared towards those who are patient and appreciate music as well as those loyal fans who REALLY appreciate Opeth's many facets no matter what sound they settle on for a given album.  While I acknowledged that \\"Watershed\\" wasn't the album to give to any new listener of Opeth, \\"Heritage\\"  most certainly is in that same category.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Capitalism: A Love Story carefully lays out the causes of the current economic catastrophe, much as \\"The Inside Job\\" does, but it shows the consequences of the heist of our economy on those of us not in the top 5%.  It also makes it easier for the average person to understand how corporations and Wall Street speculators have purchased our government and screwed the American people.   Don't believe the propaganda of the idiots paid to discredit Michael Moore.  The facts are on Moore's side, and there is ample evidence and documentation that shows the anti-MM spin has been carefully manufactured to deceive and divide the American public.
0470932139|5.0|I LOVED this book! I have been into food photography for some time now and I had some basic knowledge (like - use natural light whenever possible), but this was so helpful and inspired me to start cooking and pull out my camera to practice. The book not only covers how to use your camera and how to get good lighting, but gives you styling tips, ways to use props without going overboard, and even what colors will complement certain foods. I liked the DIY perspective she gives on a lot of stuff (like using a bed sheet to diffuse light, white craft foam board for bouncing and reflecting, etc.), showing you can take beautiful photos without spending tons of $$ on expensive equipment. She also tells you what she uses for her wood backgrounds and gives resources for how to make your own. It's all written in a conversational, easy to understand style.  Highly recommend this book for both the beginner and experienced food photographer!

B000UE29SW|5.0|I read this book almost 20 years ago after the death of my beloved Godmother.  It was comforting and real.  I purchased several copies of this book back then, and gave them as gifts to friends who had lost love ones.  They all felt the same way I did after reading it...comforted.  After suffering the loss of my younger brother to a very brief illness, I purchased this book again to read, to be comforted and to pass onto my other siblings.  Thank you for being honest and truthful in the most compassionate way.
B005NA3B8U|2.0|I gotta say that I love all of the R-Type series. Some of the most awesome old school games ever! This version is a perfect rendition of the old r type with a horrible twist of more than bad controls!!! The standard is finger controls which gives amazing manuverability, however the ship is located under your finger so you can't see what's happening aside from ammo being launched from you thumb. The other manuver option is with a joy pad that works great aside from cutting your speed down by about 4/5ths. I have played the first level about 20 times and not been able to beat the boss because I can not see what's going on with the ship or because I can not move fast enough. I know this is a horribly lengthy review, but I feel others need to know these key factors. Especially if you love the classics as I do. This one needs some work :(
0525423281|5.0|Sigh... is it over?  Already?!<br />I wanted this book to go on forever.  I fell in love with the characters, the setting, the romance... everything.  I just loved it!  It seems like I keep getting asked if it was better then Anna and the French Kiss.  I don't know if it was or not.  I think I liked it as much though.  The thing is, in Anna I loved that it took place in Paris and that St. Clair had an accent.  In Lola I loved, I mean really really really loved Lola.  More then I loved Anna.  And I loved Cricket but maybe not more then St. Claire, but I did love his style.  Really, they are two different books that are both amazing.  Amazing amazing.<br />I already mentioned I loved Lola.  I loved that she was different.  That she was herself and her personality popped off the page.  She wasn't perfect.  She made mistakes and she was a little stupid sometimes, but she's a teenager.  Teenagers make mistakes and love isn't an easy thing as a teen.  Geez, I was in love like six times as a teen.  Or at least I thought so.  But Lola's sense of style was actually something I could relate to.  I was different like her as a teen.  At least I tried my hardest!<br />Cricket is so stinking cute I could just squeeze him right now.  You know, if he was real.  I love that he was persistent without being persistent.  Meaning, he was there for her, she knew that but he didn't try anything.  He had an amazing personality and his kindness and thoughtfulness was just, well, HOT.<br />Lola and Cricket are the main characters but Lola's two dads are pretty awesome (they are gay dads) and her family life was pretty strong through the book.  I really liked that.  And I was really able to picture it all so clearly! I liked that they were a tight knit family but they still had their problems and their own ways of dealing with things.  I think that Stephanie did a great job in making it all feel real.<br />Oh, and if you're me you're missing Anna and St. Claire.  Well, don't despair!  They're there!  Anna works with Lola at the movie theater and St. Claire tags along.  And they end up having some other connections.  But basically they are friends with Lola and Cricket and make several appearances.  As cute as ever!<br />  EEK, this is getting long!  And really all you all need to know is this, this book is brilliant!a works with Lola at the movie theater and St. Claire tags along.  And they end up having some other connections.

B0036S4B6M|4.0|I was only moderately interested in reading this book but am glad I did. While incarcerated, Ms. Kerman remained sensibly low key and that paid off for her.   Too much is made in reviews of her upper middle class Smith background. Anyone can be stupid, class nowwithstanding. I have a similar background and have made mistakes; not that one but plenty of others.    The most depressing aspect is the prison guards. I know exactly one person who has been a prison guard. He is now a college professor, a seemingly gentle person whom I thought would have a little compassion. No, he doesn't. I guess there are brutish people in the world and they could not get away with brutish behavior in an office setting or a factory setting or in any number of civilized places. So they take comfort in confronting the downtrodden with every device (overenforcing rules, verbal abuse, threat of solitary) at hand. The guards who treat prisoners respectfully are derided by their peers.   Thank you, Ms. Kerman, for raising my awareness in a number of ways. I was glad to see the list of references in the back of the book. I hope to send books.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Well written story...  But what made me read it more than once the first month I had it was and the great blend of \\"classic\\" dorkiness with the new, chic dorkiness.  Bad 80's movie references?  Got 'em.  High-tech MMO that lots of gamers today would kill for?  Got it.  Really, pick your poison- if you ever played a single game of pac man in a pizza place as a kid, this one is for you.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I'm building my workout DVD collection with activities that are not considered traditional workouts. I wanted a Belly Dance DVD where the instructor was a bit more believable than a lot of the others, and I found all that I was looking for in Serpentine!  This is the perfect addition.  With this DVD you can pick and choose which segments you want for your workouts, or for your belly dance learning experience.<br /><br />I love that there are 2 DVDs:<br /><br />DVD #1: Focuses on yoga strength training for belly dance,isolation & shimmy drills.<br /><br />DVD #2: You get to see choreography, then the demo, then the choreography is broken up into loops so that you can practice a part over and over again.<br /><br />Great idea!
6305718954|5.0|Great movie! The effects are mind blowing. The acting is amazing. I like the suspence and  the drama, there isn't  a movie today that tops this story line, :-)
030788743X|4.0|There was a lot in this book that made me want to roll my eyes, mostly the 80s nostalgia schtick.  I grew up in that decade and yeah I loved all the same stuff and yeah I've loaded programs from a cassette drive on a vic-20.  All of the pop culture nostalgia doesn't necessarily make for a good book.  It kind of strikes me as a not so subtle marketing method.  \\"Hey!  Do you like the 80s?  Did you play D&D?  You'll LOVE this book.\\"    In spite of the above cynicism, Ready Player One is actually a pretty good story.  Its a nerd fantasy that hits all of the right notes.  And even though I wanted to roll my eyes at times, I just flat out enjoyed it.    I've been looking through some of the other reviews, and I have to disagree that this is really great sci-fi, because its not.  Comparisons to Neal Stephenson are just ludicrous.  It reminded me more of something written by Rob Sheffield or Chuck Klosterman.  Full of geeky, in-the-know references, in the context of an adventure story where the boy gets the girl at the end.  Anyway, if you consider yourself a geek or you ever had a crush on Jordan in Real Genius, then you will probably enjoy this book.  Its not a book that I would recommend for everyone.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Got this game at Bestbuy for $25, and I must say; it's one of the best PS2 games. Definitely a worth buying.
B000067FP8|5.0|Put simply, Gremlins 2 is genius. A hidden gem that goes in a totally different direction than the original, and it works. It may be a bit dated now, but this movie is clever and funny as hell.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Absolutely the best series ever produced. A combination of fighting in the arena, training, loyalty, corruption, sex, and scandals. Brilliantly paced, incredibly compelling and fascinating, with extremely graphic slow-motion violence and blood sprays, steamy sex scenes, and sexual innuendos pertaining to the male anatomy. The villains are delightfully evil, the women exude lust, and the gladiators are vicious killing machines and are perfect EYE CANDY.<br />The entire cast is superb.<br />Excellent!!
B000GFLI3C|5.0|Speak and Spell was clearly Vince Clarke's album; it had some nice catchy melodies and funny vocals, but was all in all very happy-go-lucky and light-hearted, good for a dance or laugh, but nothing really substantial or long-lasting. A Broken Frame was Martin Gore trying his luck as a songwriter; it had some decent moments (like Leave in Silence), but was overall a too patchy and 'juvenile' effort (most songs being written by Martin at the age of 16). Construction Time Again saw Depeche Mode growing in darkness and maturity, and with the addition of Alan Wilder also improving in sound and production values; I only find it a bit too one-sidedly moralistic or 'political'.  With the release of Some Great Reward, the real Depeche Mode were taking shape for the firs time; it had already the DM characteristic cynical introspective lyrics, dark brooding music and aggressive industrial noises.  \\"Something to Do\\" starts off the album very well; it has a relentless driving drumbeat, aggressive sounding synthbass and desperate vocals about boredom and frustration (there are similarities to Soft Cell here  and with the quirky lyric 'I'd put your pretty dress on' pointing to something Martin would really do in the not to distant future).  \\"Lie to Me\\" is less desperate and aggressive, being more laid-back and cynical in tone (and also offering a glimpse of hope with lyrics like 'Make me think that at the end of the day some great reward will be coming my way').  \\"People Are People\\" was released as the lead-off single and granted Depeche Mode with their highest chart position to date. I like the cool break beats, synthbass and various industrial noises, but find the lyrics a bit too moralising, untypical for Depeche Mode/Martin Gore (this being more in vein with the songs on Construction Time Again).  \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" sees Martin Gore taking lead vocals. It seems lighter in tone musically and lyrically (but nevertheless brings about some cynicism or self-rejection with lyrics like 'The respect you have for me - I don't deserve any').  \\"Stories of Old\\" is dark and sarcastic again musically and lyrically, singing about love that has 'been wrecked' (though the third stanza seems of a bit of a turning point here, or showcasing Martin Gore's lyrical ambiguity that he often referred to in his interviews).  \\"Somebody\\" again sees Martin Gore take lead vocals. Apart from the piano and Martin's incredible vocals, it's a very stripped down affair, only accompanied by some tape recordings in the background. The lyrics and atmosphere are well-conceived, warm and introspective (I find it a little bit odd though that this was released as a single; \\"Lie to Me\\" would surely have been a cleverer choice, at least in commercial terms).  \\"Master and Servant\\" was released as the second single, also quite successful. It shows Depeche Mode from a very aggressive and uncompromising side, musically (electro-industrial) and lyrically, singing about no less than 'Treat me like a dog' and 'Forget all about equality', this song being about BDSM practices essentially (but also offering the sarcastic inference that these sado-masochistic acts of violence and repression are 'a lot like life').  \\"If You Want\\" turns out to be musically quite similar to \\"Master and Servant\\", but written by Alan Wilder, it's lyrically much more obscure. What I really like is the initial sequence (the first stanza): it's very dark and foreboding, with some stomping beat, 'evil' sounding synthbass, some scary noises in the background and Dave Gahan's voice sounding strangely altered (maybe this giving a hint of Alan Wilder's certain 'misanthropic' side that Martin Gore once referred in an interview). \\"If You Want\\" may not be the best track on the album, but it's a far cry from being a filler as some reviewers degradingly classified it  \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\" concludes the album in a very sinister and fatalistic tone, being even darker than many tracks on Black Celebration. It has a stark sampled slash-hammer beat, EBM/industrial synths and noises. And of course those extremely gloomy lyrics, singing about no less than things like 'Slashed her wrists, bored with life', or 'Hit by a car, ended up on a life-support-machine'. It's relating the fatal stories (failed suicide attempt and fatal accident) of two young girls (or is it the same girl?), all this accompanied by a bigoted religious believe (which didn't prevent the girl's dead). With the cynical line 'I think that God's got a sick sense of humour' in the chorus, this song clearly shows Martin Gore's deprecating (or at least highly ambiguous) view towards religion.  All in all I find Some Great Ward a satisfyingly dark album, showcasing the real Mode sound and topics for the first time.  The 2006 reissued collectors edition comes with some decent remastering, insightful liner notes by Daniel Miller (the booklet also containing all the lyrics for the first time), and a fully loaded bonus DVD containing an informative short film, a 5.1 stereo mix of the album, a few live tracks and the three album's singles b-sides.   I only find it a shame slightly that all those bonus material was put on a DVD instead of a CD, being somewhat detrimental for more conventional listeners like me (I at least would have wished the b-sides on CD as well, there would have been enough space).  Anyways, this 2006 collectors edition is certainly a worthwhile purchase which I firmly recommend (even worth a re-purchase if you own the album already in one form).

159562015X|4.0|Strengths Finder 2.0 was an easy to use very good guidance system for helping you to attain your personal and career oriented goals.  The reading and test were both easy and the results came very close to what I truly was.  Plus, the summations were good in that you may even find out key components about yourself you never knew, such as how other people perceive your traits.  Put in the proper perspective, this was a very good return on the money and hopefully helps individuals to orient goals by their strengths; therefore you will be much more likely to succeed and be happier in life (i.e. purpose driven).
B003O86FMW|4.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" is the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy, following the first book by the same name.  It is considered young adult fiction but many readers, including me, are older adults who still very much enjoy the series.  I don't tend to read a lot of YA literature since I find a lot of it to be pretty awful but have enjoyed this series so far.  There is a fair amount of violence contained in these pages since the objective of the Hunger Games is for only one person to survive (leaving 23 deaths each time) but it is handled well.  I also enjoy having a female character who is a bit stronger.  As a role model, I still like Hermione Granger from Harry Potter better but Katniss is better than many female protagonists in contemporary YA literature.  As the mother of a (now older) teenager, as she was growing up I had a hard time with the number of books geared toward teenage audience with half-dressed girls on the front cover and the main topic of book being chasing boys, looking cute, and gossiping about other girls.  The Hunger Games is a nice alternative to all of that \\"girlie\\" mess out there that many of our young women read.<br /><br />This second book continues the story started in \\"The Hunger Games\\" and they really must be read in order.  This one builds upon the first one and shouldn't be read as a stand-alone novel.  If you haven't read the first one, stop here as there will be spoilers ahead.  \\"Catching Fire\\" follows Katniss and Peeta as they embark on their victory tour around the country of Panem.  Even though they were the victors, Katniss is very aware that The Capital, and particularly President Snow, is not happy with them and how things turned out.  By forcing the decision of having co-victors, these two teenagers made the government look bad and The Capital is out to fix that problem.  The remainder of the novel after the initial set-up is how the government extracts its revenge and how the two main characters deal with the situation in which they find themselves.<br /><br />Overall, I found the book to be a good read and very much along the same lines as the first novel.  There were times when I thought the pacing was a bit slow through the middle, but the beginning and end make the book worth the slower parts in between.  I thought the relationship between Katniss and Peetra was nicely developed and I felt more of a connection between these two main characters which was helpful to me.  If you enjoyed \\"The Hunger Games\\", you will most likely enjoy this second installment.  Well worth a read, and not just for young adults.h they find themselves.<br /><br />Overall, I found the book to be a good read and very much along the same lines as the first novel.

0062060554|4.0|Mystery and intrigue are the fundamental focus of this book and, if you enjoy trying to figure out the riddle of a book, this just might be the next read for you.   The premise of the book is similar to the movie \\"50 First Dates\\" with Drew Barrymore. Christine Lucas suffered a terrible trauma some 20 years ago and, as a result, has completely lost her memory. Every morning she wakes up with no memory of who or where she is. Some days she wakes up believing she's still a child or adolescent, and other days believing she's a young and attractive 20-something woman; and each morning she's shocked to look in the mirror and see a 50-something woman staring back at her. She simply remembers nothing once she falls asleep at night and awakens in the morning, and has to be told each day who she is, who her husband is, and who the important people are in her life.   To tell you more about this book is to give away its secrets, which would be unfair to future readers. Suffice it to say that \\"somehow\\" Christine has a feeling that something's not right and must find a way to discover what that something is before she falls asleep each night...or before her life becomes in serious jeopardy.   Definitely a good read, especially if your'e looking for a fairly light page-turner. It's not the best book I've ever read, but it certainly was worth the read and i found it difficult to put down.
1609611543|5.0|Dr. Davis's book is a gutsy treatise of how wheat has become one of the nutritional banes of our existence. Read this book with an open mind. Set your love of carbs aside and read it cover to cover. Let it sink in. I think you'll ditch you morning bagel lickety-split.
B005RUS78K|2.0|I started watching this show about two weeks ago. I came across it in Netflix and it had high ratings, so I said \\"why not?\\" Netflix only has the first 3 seasons mind you. That'd explain the high ratings. The reason? Well, this show started out well, it had a terrific concept. In a week I became a fan of this show. As I started watching Season 4 I began to notice the shift. Looking at this episode now, I can't believe how I went from being hooked and loving this show, to almost hating it.  The idea of watching this nerdy geek teacher going bad seemed pretty cleaver. It was like a promised of dark humor; not any more. The tone has become dark and too dramatic. I feel disappointed. I don't need to tune (or buy) to watch something like this. I don't need to, watching the weak people being kicked around is what I see every day in life. I was hoping to see him kicking ass. Two of the coolest and most memorable parts in the whole series (so far), was the \\"Stay out of my territory\\" and \\"This... is not meth...\\" scenes, where you even get the chills realizing what a b@da$$ guy a feeble man can turn into when put between a rock and a hard place.  Almost every show out there is about this bad guy in a suit having the power to, and usually almost successfully, disposing of the guy we're rooting for (for the most part). This proved again this story is going down the tubes little by little. Maybe this is what happens when you let all this bunch of writers scribble all over what was once a terrific script and concept.  To be honest, I'm not surprised the show's ratings went up and down. I've already lost interest in it. I won't be watching another season of this. I just won't. This story was good while it lasted as it was intended.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I am a sucker for stories where people have supernatural powers. I was immediately sucked into the book's story and attached to the characters portrayed in it. The haunting (real life, antique, and collectable) photographs that are littered through the book make it all the more appealing. The storyline was good, but I was slightly disappointed with the ending. Partly because I didn't want it to end, but partly because it seemed like an ending to a movie that will obviously have a sequel. There are a lot of questions unanswered in the ending. Will there be a book 2? I don't know. I'd read it, if there was. All in all, a very entertaining book and a good premise. I could totally see this as a movie.
B0054YIQK8|5.0|I saw this film twice when it first came out in the mid-80s.  I think it's very difficult to make a film of an opera using realistic locations and movie techniques rather than just filming a staged production.  This and the Ingmar Bergman Magic Flute are, in my opinion, the only truly successful examples of such.  Here the singing is excellent, the acting is very good, and the action is thrilling.  I had often wondered why Don Jose was making such a fool of himself over this woman.  Julia Migenes-Johnson answers that question in spades.  Never, in my experience, has Carmen been portrayed with such sensuousness.  The other principals, Placido Domingo as Don Jose and Ruggero Ramondi as Escamillo are fine in both the singing and acting departments.  I assume that the singers dubbed the film but it's not all that obvious.  The Blue-ray reproduction sparkles.  One word of caution.  The film opens with a very graphic bullfight.  I think it works very well dramatically but an animal was obviously \\"harmed during the making of this motion picture.\\"
B000VE439Y|5.0|I had an old vcr tape of \\"Monty Python's Life Of Brian\\" and it was getting old and near the end of its' life so I decided to buy a DVD. I got it on time in good condition and would use this company again if the price it right.
0307272702|5.0|This book was incredibly logical and convincing. There are many, many references to past medical studies throughout the book. I'm looking forward to reading some of them. My own experiences are supported by the conclusions drawn by the author. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who has an interest in nutrition and weight loss. I know I'll be giving it as a gift.   The book makes many, many arguments based on scientific research. However, it also makes a number of points that are rooted in plain, old common sense. Two of those common-sense points are incredibly simple: the ever-increasing rate of obesity in our developed culture is evidence that the normal diet is unhealthy; and, humans have evolved over millions of years, and for almost all of those previous generations, our ancestors did not eat high-carb foods (sugar, bread, pasta, etc.). For anyone who doesn't trust their common sense, the numerous references to scientific studies should be helpful.   It's a relatively easy read. There are some suggestions for meal plans in an appendix. However, it is not a comprehensive diet or meal-planning book. It is very well-written to help readers understand the logic for limiting carbs in our diet. If you want to know why a low-carb diet works, this book is excellent.
B005KP7EK4|5.0|Incredible cinematography and storytelling with a talented cast that leaves you feeling like you know these people, and care about what happens to them.  Slow, filled with dialogue and long cinematic shots, if you prefer transformers, this is not fo you.
6305128952|3.0|Years ago I read the book about the life of Monty Roberts, The man who listens to horses, a real life horse whisperer, and it is fantastic. When my husband brought home this film I was hoping it would be based on his life or his methods. Robert's gift is the knowledge that gentling and gaining the trust of the horse is all about the listening, not the talking even if it is a whisper.<br /><br />This film, which is another story entirely, starts of with one of the most incredible opening scenes ever. Also, the relationships between the teen and her horse, girlfriend, and mother are all very real.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the whole horse whispering plot was not nearly so strong. Redford did not seem to have a genuine relationship with any of his own horses, in fact none even seemed to have names. Whereas Monty, a real horse whisperer, always brought a presence of calm and confidence to horses, often Redford agitated the horse star Pilgrim using more of \\"tough love\\" methods making observers including the teen girl have to shade eyes and look away. At one point Redford ties one of the horses legs and brings him to the ground in dog- like submission, a very unnatural, terrifying position for a horse. It made me remember one of the methods Monty's SOB father would use to break his horses, and one Monty found entirely unnecessary and harmful to a horses spirit.<br /><br />If you are an animal lover looking for a film for insights on animal human relationships, look elsewhere. If you are a Robert Redford fan and enjoy scenic movies with spectacular filming, you may want to give it a try.
B002SCKT0O|4.0|I found this to be a funny and yet strange movie. Danny Devito and Arnold Schwarzenegger have good comedic chemistry.  The strange part is the science fiction idea of a pregnant man. Yet the characters bring good humor to the plot making  it believable. I thought it was a good movie. I, personally, like their movie: 'Twins' better, and this should have been  the sequel to 'Twins.' None-the-less it is worth seeing.
0470901071|1.0|when you search for CCNA on Amazon.com, this book will appear the first choice!! I really do not find a reason for this!!!  When 1st opened, my hands started to itch very bad, I tried tolerating it but I could not, even if you are not allergic you will feel that it is the worst paper quality ever!!  Also, the papers are off-white and not real white color! so it is not good for your eyes..  I have returned this book when i received it and now it is in its way back to Amazon for money refund..  Although i had to pay for shipment return but its ok because I will not be able to use it anyway because of its bad finishing and quality. studying requires a good quality paper book, not this one for sure!!!!  I am really disappointed, now i will be looking for another book, any suggestions are welcome.

0553801473|3.0|Slow, disjointed, and close to being a chore to read for the first 2/3rds of the book.  Unless you are totally into this series I suggest you walk away...
B0000AUHQF|4.0|I have seen this movie a dozen times and I absolutely love it!!  That being said the reason I purchased this movie was because I wanted my 10 yr old son to watch it and couldn't find it anywhere to rent or buy except on line and I always find it cheaper and easier to purchase from Amazon.  I loved the movie my son thought it was very boring, and watching it with him in mind I guess you could say it would be for young kids. I would have given it a 5 star but because my son didn't like it I could not, but still a must see movie.  It does have a few extras like the story behind the movie and some quick interviews but didn't have as much documentaries as I would have liked.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|workable very well in my HTC EVO. Lots of free good books and novellas to read. This is a MUST app!

B000NJMJGG|4.0|I have loved this movie since my childhood. Having rewatched it recently, I see that its special effects are a little dated and the story is predictable, yet it is easy to see this movie's influence in cinema. Its epic tale draws to mind contemporary adventures involving imaginative, fantasy worlds. It is funny, romantic and exciting, enjoyable for children and adults.
0385344325|5.0|Glad to finally find out the true reason behind Reacher leaving the Army.  I love the character and I'm just bummed that I've read all of the books and now have to wait for another one.  Also, if you're turned off by the violence, I'm pretty sure you need to find another series to read.
0553386794|5.0|First, I just want to say that I noticed a lot of the low reviews state that the book has way too much porn. I don't know what they're reading, but I'm about 350 pages in so far and I've read maybe 2 paragraphs total out of all of those pages having anything to do with nudity/sex.<br /><br />Anyway, the book is awesome so far. There isn't tons of fantasy like most people have stated, but there is enough. There isn't tons of action yet, but like I said.. I haven't finished the book.<br /><br />I gave the book 5 stars because so far I love almost all of the characters and the story seems pretty solid.<br /><br />WATCHING PHILLIES NLDS! WOULD WRITE MORE, BUT GOT TO GO!<br /><br />Pick the book up though.
0756655307|5.0|Bought this for my super hero lover and it is awesome.  It has every character I have ever seen or know of and more from the Marvel Universe.  Also bought the DC book.  They are both printed by the same publishing house so they are the same size and look like a set.  Picture on cover is printed on both the dust cover and the hard cover.  My son will love it!!
B005G4TJI4|1.0|I pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for 18$ but I was so wrong! Not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were NO EXTRAS on either the blu ray or the regular dvd!! They rushed this out to trick us all. This is worth 5$ not 20$! For 20$ I bought the extended edition blu ray/DVD combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over 4 hours of extras! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERISON! THIS MOVIE IS SO INCREDIBLE save your money and wait to see it with the extras! trust me!!! I returned this the day I got it, and will be saving up for the deluxe edition and maybe even the box set with tons of extras!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE THE DANCING AND SONGS ARE GREAT BESIDE LIKING THE TIME SETTING OF 1963. PATRICK AND JENNIFER MAKE IT WORK SO WELL. I LOVED THE OUTTAKES AND ALL THE BONUS FEATURES. THE BOOK IS GREAT WITH TERRIFIC PICTURES AND INFORMATION.  I ALREADY HAD DVD OF MOVIE BUT THIS ONE HAS SO MUCH MORE INCLUDED . IT'S TO BAD PATRICK SWAYZE DIED HE WAS A VERY TALENTED DANCER/SINGER/ACTOR .
0764137433|3.0|This book is quite useful to review the necessary verbs as they are put in a good tense format.  However, the examples for the verbs are out of date or they sound awkward. They could have found examples from daily life. Some sound quite silly and you definitely need a native Russian who lives in Russia to correct what is really meant in the sentence or make a new whole sentence.
B005CMSDKA|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie from the reviews and trailer.  Purchased the Blue-Ray but now have buyers remorse after watching it.  The movie starts out pretty good with the main character hunting and killing a caribou in the frozen north (Siberia perhaps - we never know).  Shortly thereafter, it just gets stupid.  Lots of scenes of the main character running, running, running with a wooden expression on her face.  By the time something interesting took place I was long past the point of caring.  The writers left the story wide open for a sequel, but I don't think I'll bother.
B004ZLBTK0|5.0|This sophomore effort from Adele is rich in lyrics, production, heart, soul and voice.  The extra live tracks at the end put the cherry on top.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Just got my hands on this album last week and wow ! such a ride sonically.  Great songs on the album , what gets the listener the most is the diversity in the sounds. Wilson literally goes on from some really dark drone sound in \\"Index\\" all the way to some straight up alternative sounds like \\"Postcard\\" this album really has no dull moments.Not to forget wilsons trademark melodic vocals laced with harmonies in the right amounts. It feels like the songs on this album have been a collection of tunes wilson has written over a while , theres shades of the \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" sound on Post Card while the title song \\"Grace for Drowning\\" has traces of the dark stupid dream sound.The instrumentation on the album also stands out , done in the right quantities , there are no signs of showing off as many more other prog bands tend to do.Every song on the album has its own moments , and like most of wilsons other albums tend to generate a real good listening experience when heard as a whole. This album is a next step from wilsons previous solo effort insurgents , this is a double disc album , much like the same way porcupine tree evolved (Deadwing->FOABP->The Incident).  All in all , such a great album , if you have not heard any of wilsons solo stuff , this is a perfect place to start off.Here's to hoping for more similar great music form him , cannot wait to see the live shows in New York later this Fall!

The vocals on this one are crystal clear. The drums, dynamic range, and low registers are simply perfect. Compared to my hits CD its no-contest as that title is a bit unfocused and thin sounding while this one is more polished.   Easily Recommended.
1608191664|5.0|I don't necessarily agree with everything in this book, both overall Chang presents a strong critique of the ideology of unregulated free markets, backed with ample data and clear arguments.  The book covers too much ground for me to attempt a summary, but the key idea is that markets will function better for a society if its government gets involved in appropriate ways.  That doesn't mean a heavy-handed approach with overzealous central planning, but rather a targeted approach in which sound empirically-grounded economic measures are applied.  The results will be better not just in terms of aggregate productivity, but also with respect to equity and non-materialistic values.  Highly recommended for anyone who can approach the book with a critical but open mind.
B001MYIQFE|4.0|Ok after being floored by other Audio Fidelity titles recently purchased, I had to check this title out. It seems there are some who feel this title is a total rip-off wile others praise the audio quality. I decided to buy both the regular and gold versions and see for myself what all of the fuzz was about.   Original CD sounds OK which is a big compliment given the recent trend of mastering music at high levels with the usual high frequency boost. I would say given the price it is a good value and an improvement over the mixes on the Rhino label greatest hits which I also own. What the Audio Fidelity brings to the table is a more focused and balanced presentation. Vocals in particular are a bit more polished. The gold CD is also notably warmer without being muddy so its a bit more comfortable on the ears in my opinion.  As far as the gaps - I was expecting something terrible given all of the negative reviews but I am glad to say those were exagerated. The album still sounds coherent and the flow is not dramatically changed by this error or whatever people are calling it. As for the HDCD I dont really put too much weight on this since people have constantly failed in Double Blind Tests to identify a CD, DVD Audio or SACD layer of the same recording (note some hybrid SACDs have different mastering for the CD and SACD layers so its apples and oranges). Not convinced ? go research some papers in your school library.  I give this one 4 stars and not five because the original CD is still available new for sale and it is 1/4 the price.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Ico is by far my favorite game of the previous console generation. I had never before played a game that so grabbed me, emotionally speaking. Sure, there had been games that sucked a lot of my time, and that I really loved. But Ico *moved* me. If ever there were an argument for \\"games as art,\\" Ico is it.<br /><br />I will admit, though, that the follow up, Shadow of the Colossus, kind of left me cold. I really dug the aesthetic, but the controls were so teeth-gnashingly frustrating that I didn't finish it.<br /><br />So it kind of stunk when Sony removed backward compatibility from the PS3. Once I replaced my YLOD 60gb with a new Slim model, I could no longer play my old Ico disc, or finish up my copy of SotC. I was thrilled, then, when this collection was announced. 2 games, 1080p graphics, bonus features, all running at a solid frame rate? Sign me up! I sold my Ico disc right away (for a cool sixty smackers, given its rarity) and pre-ordered this bargain-priced collection - the same price as buying two PS2 Greatest Hits titles.<br /><br />I was even more thrilled when I learned that we in the states would finally be getting the real version of the game without the cuts. Now, I'll finally be able to do a second playthrough with Yorda's dialogue translated, slightly harder puzzles, new weapons, and co-op play.<br /><br />OK. Enough preview. So how is it? Worth every penny, that's how it is. The graphics look wonderful - now in full 16:9 widescreen for Ico, with a level of sharpness and clarity at 1080p that blows away the SD versions. The colors are less muddy and all of the textures can be seen clearly. Does it look like a current game? No, not at all. The textures and geometry haven't really been touched. But it looks at least as good as the \\"Prince of Persia Sands of Time\\" HD remake. The art design and lighting engines of both games were really great for their day, and translate into beautiful experiences even by today's standards.<br /><br />The sound is lovely, with a DTS surround track for each game that makes positional audio really sing on a surround sound system. It really adds to the games, which tend towards long stretches without music, and are loaded with atmospheric sounds.<br /><br />Better yet, a set of trophies for each game offers lots of incentive to play and replay - which at least for Ico isn't really necessary given the game's beauty - but definitely adds to the overall experience. It definitely gets me \\"back on the horse\\" so to speak to keep at it with SotC, which still frustrates me, but I'll definitely finish this time around.<br /><br />The video features are kind of ho-hum - a lot of self-congratulating talking head interviews translated from Japanese. It is neat to see preliminary video, though, and if you get bored you can always watch at 1.5 speed and still hear everything :-)<br /><br />All in all, at this price, it's a slam dunk upgrade, even for those who own SotC. Ico alone was worth fifty bucks when it went on the market ten years ago. The graphical upgrade makes playing these classics more palatable for the modern gamer. If you like adventure/exploration type games in the slightest, you owe it to yourself to buy this, just for Ico. It's totally worth the price of entry.s positional audio really sing on a surround sound system.

B000002A40|5.0|This disc sounds fresh even today. The music is fabulous and the synergy of all of the musicians is perfect. I purchased the Gold CD based on the recommendation of some dude named Steve and now I wish I could get him to recommend me some more titles. The mastering here seems to have avoided the louder is better mentality because it begs to be turned up. Spectral balance on this CD is neutral so those who hate bright recordings for the sake of artificial air and detail will be pleased with this one. Well worth the premium price.<br /><br />I also purchased the Mobile Fidelity release but I heard this one first and I feel no need to open the Mofi - should I decide to do so I will post a comparison under that product review.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The second season dvd-set is a great improvement over the first.  The best special feature was the season two gag reel.  Hilarious!

B0055SWM08|5.0|Appropriately named.  Relaxing.  The graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay all complement each other well.  It's well worth the price in my opinion.

B004LWZW42|5.0|I was quite impressed with this new intrepretation of the X-men franchise. Mixing comic book fantasy with actual history can be a tricky thing. But Matthew Vaughn admirably juggles all his story elements to a fault, with a playful wink here & there (note: the cameo from a famous mutant...guess who?). The production is top-notch, with some very stylized 1962 set pieces (including some vintage TV footage from The Cuban Missile Crisis), some pretty awesome special effects (Magneto pulling an entire submarine out of the water was quite a sight), and a great cast. James McAvoy & Michael Fassbinder do incredibly fine jobs of actually making the roles their own without muddying up the work left by old pros Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen, whose characters of Prof. Charles Xavier & Erik \\"Magneto\\" Lensherr the film revolves around. The prequel deftly manages to explain how Xavier & Magneto start off as friends (from very different backgrounds), then as their conflict with humanity deepens, begin taking different roads on the \\"mutants & humans\\" issue. Here, we not only see how a young Henry McCoy \\"accidentally\\" mutates further into the hairy, fanged Beast, but young mutants are introduced whom we've never seen before, such as Havoc (Cyclop's brother) & the sonic-wailing Banshee. With a large cast of characters, there's always the danger of certain ones getting a raw deal on screen time. But here, each one gets his moment to shine. Add to this the measured menace of a good villain (Kevin Bacon as an energy-absorbing Nazi scientist who cruelly manipulated & tortured a young Magneto in his experiments)rounding out the cast, and the film is just plain fun to watch.   Marvel Studios, keep those good X-men films coming!
B00005NIE1|4.0|Have never been able to get enough of this album. HOWEVER: Beware, the vinyl includes 'NYC Cops', even though they don't list it on the page.  This song does not fit well on the album and it comes in right in the middle of the 2nd half of the album.  I really don't like the song at all.  To make it worse they put this song on the album in place of 'When it started'- one of my favorite strokes songs- incredible bass line, etc.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|This is a review of the free Kindle edition.<br /><br />I had, of course, heard of the Picture of Dorian Gray, but with the joy of a Kindle I'm now able to read it for free.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />The story is amazing.  The character of Dorian Gray shines (sucks the light out of the room?) during the story.  The imagery of the picture is wonderful to reflect the corruption of Dorian's soul.  Along with Dorian, I do wonder if he could have reversed it, if he had cared enough to try.  The ending while abrupt, was perfect for the character, as it seems that Dorian was protected by something, to make sure that his end could only come about the way that it did.<br /><br />Definite recommend.
B000063TE5|5.0|I love everything about this album- the experimentation, the odd sounds, the mixing of poppy and artsy, the fight with the record company, the instrumentation, the deconstruction and reconstruction of the songs, the album cover, the vocals and the lyrics. HOWEVER, what is up with the line 'take off your band-aid 'cause I don't believe in touchdowns?' It's been ten years. I don't get it or like it. Still...this album is amazing!
B003PIUC02|2.0|I read all these really high 5 star reviews and I'm honestly scratching my head.  The plot is too plain, the characters all speak like they're in any high school (yes your kids speak like this).  Sure I can see where people are into the sex and violence, but there are better movies and series for both.  It honestly works out like a poorly written graphic novel.  I watched this because it was highly recommended by a coworker, a coworker that I can no longer accept the opinions on media from.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but it looks like I'm in the minority.  Save your money for a series with a good story like Game of Thrones.
B00466HN86|5.0|I loved this movie.  One of the few great movies this year I could take my kid to. She loved it so much too!I'm definitely buying this when it comes out!
B000CNESU8|4.0|Wonderfully written and acted film.  3 acting Oscars...to Dunaway, Finch and Beatrice Straight.  William Holden, Robert Duvall and Ned Beatty were also excellent, especially Holden.  Still pertinent today.  Really a sort of fictionalized expose of the TV industry.  And the American public and its tastes.  In fact especially pertinent in this time of reality tv.  Highly recommend \\"Network.\\"
B004EPZ09S|3.0|Contagion begins with a boom: Any movie that has the boldness to kill off Gwyneth Paltrow in the first ten minutes is guaranteed to capture the audience's attention. Paltrow's character dies suddenly and unexpectedly, and the rest of the movie is spent attempting to identify the disease that killed her and to vaccinate against it.<br /><br />Contagion's plot is close enough to reality that you won't have to suspend disbelief, and you'll leave the theater with a lingering desire for hand sanitizer. The story is just close enough to reality to draw you to the edge of your seat, but ultimately the movie fails to satisfy.<br /><br />Contagion has great potential, only increased by its fascinating and compelling first twenty minutes. Ultimately you'll leave the theater entertained but somewhat underwhelmed. Plot holes and minimal resolution make this movie finish far worse than the opening scenes lead you to expect.<br /><br />(For those who might be a bit squeamish -- there are only a couple of scenes during which you'll want to look away: one with frighteningly-realistic and graphic seizures, and another involving an autopsy.)
B000MQC9H4|5.0|The Holiday is the story of two girls on the rebound from problem love affairs and how they solved their problems together by trading homes and locations for the holidays.  It is easy to watch and the plot is unforgettable.  You'll love it!
0061928356|5.0|\\"Secret Daughter\\" is a sensitive treatment of family relationships in all its convoluted combinations. To this Gowda adds the theme of comparative cultures and how they intersect. Yet, in the first sections of the book the writing lacks the sustaining energy that the reader expects from such rich material. The alternating, connected plotlines present two sets of parents: Jasu and Savita Merchants, Asha's Indian birth-parents and Krishnan and Somer Thakkar, her adoptive parents. As with many stories that are told in parallel, this one doesn't give them equal weight. Jasu and Savita are more finely drawn and get the most interesting scenes, while Krishnan and Somer seem to walk through their roles - at least in the beginning. Perhaps, Gowda purposely suppresses the characters' emotional pull to better show their growth, both internal and in relation to each other. Regardless, I'm glad that I didn't give up on it, because this writer hits full stride with \\"Only One Regret,\\" a chapter that focuses on Jasu Merchant, the birth-father and continues to run with a vivid, textured look at everyone tied to Asha as she searches for and discovers her roots . Initially I compared Gowda's writing to Indu Sundaresan's. (Okay, my mistake.) While Gowda still has formidable competition up against Sundaresan, who has covered the same themes with more stirring prose and dynamic characters, Gowda brings something special to the subjects.  As I read further, I realized that Gowda's quiet genius is in the subtly she uses to present her characters, each with carefully crafted personas. This is a story that will resonate with everyone who is linked to someone special by birth or by choice. As Krishnan tells his daughter, \\"The family you create is more important than the one you're born into.\\" My criticism notwithstanding, Gowda has created a masterpiece.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|WOW! THAT WORD SUMS IT ALL UP. OH HOW I LOVE/D THIS SHOW. LEE MAJORS WAS SO HANDSOME AND SO YOUNG IN THIS SERIES. I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE THE NEXT EPISODE. I WAS SO YOUNG WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS SHOW. I REGRET THAT I DIDN'T SEE IT IN IT'S ENTIRETY. BUT I COULDN'T WAIT TO TUNE IN THE VERY NEXT WEEK FOR THE NEXT EPISODE. I JUST HAD TO SEE \\"STEVE AUSTIN\\" USING HIS BIONIC BODY TO GET THE BAD GUY, OUT RUN ANY HUMAN, OR LIFT A CAR SO THAT \\"OSCAR GOLDMAN\\" COULD CHANGE A TIRE. IT WAS AND STILL IS SUCH A GREAT SHOW. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET MY COPY. JUST AS A SIDE NOTE: THIS SERIES WAS/IS OFFERED BY TIME-LIFE. THE ADVERTISEMENTS WERE ON TELEVISION. I ALMOST BOUGHT IT BUT SOMEHOW I JUST COULDN'T PART WITH $40 FOR IT. NOW THAT IT IS BEING OFFERED FOR LESS THAN $30 I AM VERY SATISFIED. I THINK I'M GOING TO ADD THIS TO MY CHRISTMAS LIST.
0307595862|3.0|I enjoyed this Norwegian-based mystery.  I think the basic premise was so unbelievable as to take away from my enjoyment of the book, but I enjoyed the writing and the Norwegian setting.  I thought the entire \\"snowman\\" idea was silly, but like I said, it's still an enjoyable read.  I think this author is probably lucky the \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" series was so popular, and he's getting dragged along in the wake, like a grand prix biker.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Best of all the X men series.  Great acting, story and effects.  Kevin Bacon is great as the bad guy.

0525423281|4.0|A sweet, and touching story, and a very worthy successor to Ana and the French Kiss!<br /><br />~ Premise ~<br /><br />Its summer and Lola's greatest ambitions for her time consist of spending time with her rock star boyfriend and creating a magnificent Marie Antoinette costume for the winter formal.  Things start going awry for her when her childhood sweetheart moves back into the neighborhood.  Old passions clash with new, making Lola who her heart really needs.<br /><br />~ Characters ~<br /><br />Lola: Lola is a different sort of heroine than Ana.  She's quirky, loud, and spunky, with a temper and a sarcastic wit.  Not really mind favorite type of female heroine, but it's hard not to like her.  She's an amateur fashion designer with her own sense of style. For her every day like Halloween - dressing in costumes with wigs, tiaras, big boots, and tons of color.  She's a good student, and a loyal friend.  She also has a bad tendency to lie and hide things from people she cares about which will make you want to smack her at times.<br /><br />Max: Lola's boyfriend - he's 22, and a rockstar.  Lola's \\"dads\\" have agreed to let her date him but have imposed a ton of rules to ensure she remains as protected as possible.  He's seems to really appreciate Lola, but shows zero interest in her friends, her family, or really anything that matters to her, which makes us question the sincerity of his feeling for her.<br /><br />Cricket:  The boy that got away.  He's an inventor, shy, sweet, geeky, and often overlooked by the people in his life. Cricket and Lola grew up together - neighbors from the time they were little children.  He was her first kiss - at the ripe age of seven, and the first person she fell in love with in junior highschool.  He's also the first person that broke her heart.<br /><br />~ Romance ~<br /><br />Sugary sweet - this love could seriously give you a tooth ache.  But it's not an unrealistic kind of sweet.  Rather it's the sweet that comes from a story where the good guy really does get the girl.  I loved Cricket - he's my kind of guy. He's sweet, loyal, honest, and awkward.  You can't help but root for him, even though you don't understand in the beginning why he hurt Lola so much.  I'd have enjoyed this romance all the more if Lola was more my kind of female heroine.  She's just a bit too brash for me.  That being said, there are still plenty of swoon-worthy moments to be had in this book.<br /><br />~ My thoughts ~<br /><br />I found this story to be in turns sweet and touching.  It's a young adult drama, so don't expect tons of action.  What keeps you turning the pages here are the character relationships, and the romance that builds between Lola and Cricket.<br /><br />I'd be hard pressed to say which book I liked better - Ana or Lola.  I identified more with Ana as a character, but the romance in this book was perhaps even better than what we found in Ana.  There were less ups and downs - breakups and misunderstandings. And I think there was more wisdom hidden within its pages on the nature of relationships and what really matters in them.<br /><br />In the pages of this book we travel with Lola as she grows up, and learns to both understand and accept herself.  We learn importance of honesty in relationships, we most vitally we learn what real love looks like.  That love should be full of natural magic, it's not always easy, but it should flow.  That it's a person's imperfections that make them perfect for one another.<br /><br />So if you are in the mood for another sweet romance in the vein of Ana and the French Kiss, this book will sate your need quite nicely.guy.

B004GXL8GC|4.0|These are cute and my four year old neice loves them, but they are tiny.  The entire box is smaller than the size of an ipad.  But since Smurfs are so hard to find in stores, this is what you have to pay.  There must be a big profit margin on these, because they should be $5 instead of $25 (in my opinion---I'm sure 4 year olds would want them at any price).
B0055PMJMW|5.0|We don't get to read enough about Harry Bosch as far as I'm concerned so I was thrilled to get these stories. And I thought they were great. It's like dropping in on a random day of Bosch's life, outside of the big plotlines in the novels.   I travel a lot and I love that more and more novelists are sharing short stories via ebooks. They are great for quick reads on the road. I don't understand the people that complain that they aren't long enough or are too light. These are short stories--not novellas or novels. What do you expect? It's almost like they don't get the concept of what a short story is.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Like Japan's answer to `The Little Mermaid', `Ponyo' is every bit as enchanting and as memorable as that Disney classic.  With sharply used animation that is beautiful to look at while wholly nostalgic (this isn't your average 3D CGI spectacle), `Ponyo' creates something original and authentic.<br /><br />The film follows a young Goldfish Princess who is washed ashore after attempting to escape the domineering control of her human father, an evil wizard who hates humankind for destroying to ocean.  He is married to the Ocean's queen, a magnificent being who is far more levelheaded and endearing than her husband.  This young Princess winds up stuck in a bottle and is found by a young boy named Koichi.  Koichi is living alone with his mother while his father, a sailor, is away at work.  Koichi is enamored by this creature, a fish with the face of a human, and while he is warned by others to get rid of the fish (when creatures with faces come out of the sea, there is a tsunami), he keeps the Princess, especially when she begins to turn into a little girl.  He calls her Ponyo, and soon Ponyo and Koichi are the bestest of friends.  Sadly, Ponyo's decision to leave her aquatic home sets the world off balance, and as the Moon is pulled closer to the Earth, the waters begin encroaching on the land with devastating force.<br /><br />At the core of this film is a beautiful story of friendship and love that blossoms between two souls; Ponyo and Koichi.  They share a need to escape their current predicaments.  Ponyo feels oppressed and conditioned by her father's fears and loathing and Koichi internalizes his feelings about his father being gone and his mother slipping into depression.  They use each other to forget about their worries and `be kids', which is such a beautiful sentiment used in this film.  Both Ponyo and Koichi just want to be kids.<br /><br />A shockingly rewarding film, `Ponyo' is one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time and is certainly a joy to be seen and remembered!
B00018D3RI|5.0|Starsky: \\"It's in my report.\\"<br />Captain Dobey: \\"Oh yeah, about this report, it reads like a comic book, 'The fiery red Torino fishtails to a halt. We spill onto the street ready for action'. (tosses report at Starsky) What is this?\\"<br /><br />On DVD for the first time in a stunning 5-disc set, ABC's Starsky & Hutch (original working title \\"Nightside\\" about two cops who only worked the night shift) was and remains a highly enjoyable 70s cop show from super-producer Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. The series benefited greatly from the casting of its two leads, Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul in the iconic title roles. Their genuine chemistry and interactions with not only each other but with co-stars Bernie Hamilton (Captain Harold Dobey) and Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear) as well as the guest stars propel the smartly written and directed episodes from such notables as Michael Mann and Barry Shear respectively.<br /><br />A common misconception among potential TV DVD buyers is that 70s cop shows like Starsky & Hutch don't age well and can't hold a candle to modern shows of the genre. Having watched the show back then and now, I'm glad to report that these first season episodes are every bit as entertaining (if not more) than any show of the genre today thanks to a great cast & crew and a good balance of action, drama, and humor.

1401207529|5.0|I highly recommend Batman: Year One for anyone looking for a little more about the man behind the legend.  Even first time comic readers will be amazed by this story.    After watching Batman Begins I found many plot similarities from this book included in the movie.   The artwork by David Mazzucchelli is awesome and the writing is Frank Miller at his best.  I highly suggest this read.  I would also pick up the 'sequel' by Miller;  The Dark Knight Returns.  The books compliment each-other perfectly and the latter maintains the continuity established by Miller in Year One.    With Year One and The Dark Knight Returns you get the FULL story of the Dark Knight at the very beginning of his career and the very end.  A MUST read!

1847242537|1.0|The hype was incredible, the author deceased, the buzz contagious, so I bought the entire three book set and then....<br />I had to recycle them all!<br /><br />First thing i noticed was that the pace of the story was jerky due to the translation--\\"fair enough\\" I thought, after all we read Homer right?? Er , no, sadly the closest this got to Homer was, as in Simpson, I kept slapping my forehead and going  \\"doh!\\"<br /><br />I wallowed through the endless details about the most mundane things for 6 chapters before I finally accepted there couldn't POSSIBLY be a clever switchback link hidden in all that dry dullness----I convinced my self that there had to then be a shocking ending or a dazzling mid story plot-twist, right? right?<br /><br />WRONG!First we never even meet the \\"Big bad Wolf\\" - the main Antagonist Wennerstrom... so that avenue for a great confrontation fizzled to nothingness. Frankly by the end I was even ready to accept an  \\"i am your father Luke\\" ending ---we didn't get one of those either, all we got was an inescapable feeling that Sweden must be the dullest, coldest place on Earth-- WHICH it ISN'T! And that half the men are sexual sadists with loads of money, while bright financially independent women are happy to sleep with dull middle aged felons (with the tacit knowledge of their partners) irrespective of whether they also have questionable one-night stands with every available younger or much older woman in view who doesn't hate their guts on sight!(Which THEY AREN'T)<br /><br />Okay, so I have now concluded that the work was probably not super to begin with, possibly worsened by the EVIL translator - motives must be examined here folks, who was he REALLY? (Better plots exist you see!)<br /><br />However, over in England, you can't say out loud that this book is a load of nonsense- in my opinion the book appears to be nothing more than, \\"the Emperor's Newest suit of Swedish Clothes\\", as the European literary public appear to be consumed by an all-abiding desire to be among the \\"ton\\", with a superior taste in all things cultural- The critics loved it- {They sold us truffles and oysters too!}- so it must be excellent!!<br />Frankly, it sucks, and I refuse to be snowed into reading any more of this drivel- to borrow a phrase from a real literary classic: \\"...the emperor has nothing on!\\"taste in all things cultural- The critics loved it- {They sold us truffles and oysters too!}- so it must be excellent!!  Frankly, it sucks, and I refuse to be snowed into reading any more of this drivel- to borrow a phrase from a real literary classic: \\"...the emperor has nothing on!\\"
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|When someone asks me how this book was, my answer never waivers, \\"It was excellent... but very sad.\\" I find the fact that this is a true story written by the survivor herself makes this book, though dubbed nonfiction, more horrifying than any horror / thriller, more engaging than any mystery, more inspiring than any motivational book, and ultimately an excellent source of inspiration, hope, love, and knowledge. Hearing all this girl/woman went through and her frankly amazing light that shines, and attitude and maturity and the wonderfully positive way she strives to be a survivor, not a victim, truly awe inspiring. This is a story of mental illness, evil, sadness, drama, and tragedy. Ultimately though, it is the story of a survivor. This woman shines. And May God Bless Her and Family.

B002SSUQFG|3.0|I knew what to expect with this watch, I was disappointed with the resilience of the face, it got scratched after lightly bumping against my coffee mug. Also, the canvas strap is abrasive, I haven't noticed anyone else complaining about it, so it's probably just me, but I had to change the strap to a black leather one as it was leaving severely dry skin on my wrists. Otherwise cool watch and a fair entry level mechanical, if I could do it all over I would probably buy a Citizen's Eco Drive with a leather strap.
B000M341QE|3.0|The original fits what Martin loves to make movies about but I would have hoped he presented the movie like how Guillermo Del Toro and now Quentin Tarantino do for the films they love to watch and support.  A good film buff friend of mine showed Infernal Affairs to me around the time it came out domestically and I fell in love as everyone else did.  Later I followed up with the prequel/sequels as they came out.  Very pleased and impressed since I loved Martin's crime stories and all.<br /><br />I encourage people to try watching the original Infernal Affairs trilogy with subtitles (if reading is hard for you then I'm sorry). The originals are great films otherwise you wouldn't ever get this remake. And in the original, Wai-keung Lau's (with Yiu-Fai Lai) work is more complimentary to Michael Chapman's style for those of you who loved Taxi Driver & Goodfellas. I like the style of the actor's work with the nice subtle vibe going on with the cinematography in the original that I always enjoyed in Martin's style in his films and with Michael Chapman work which was what i was expecting to feel but didn't (the film Bringing Out The Dead is a great film by the way).  Do note though, I am not hating on Robert Richardson. I like his work on Inglorious Bastards, The Good Shepherd and even the Horse Whisperer.  As a remake though, with the two films, I felt in the remake there were more moments forced that were not needed, then again it was pressing 3 films into one.  My main beef with the Departed is simply that its unecessary and over done in a subtle way which is a complimenting minus point or low passing grade in my books a D+.  With 3 movies in one, its longer than it needs to be.<br />!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!! (yes even for a remake)<br />I felt the death of SP Wong Chi Shing was more artistic and had a stronger impact than the death of Queenan...but in American cinema, sadly Actors can have a say on how they want their character's death scene handled in films and that part displeased me the most (I say this cause something was fishy with the narration of that scene).  The death of Wong Chi Sing was more of a shock and brought on a gun fight with lots of people involved that I was hoping The Departed would've went to town with like something from Heat, but no. I didn't get any suspense and there is a weird steady cam shot looking down on the action from whoever was holding it that felt very community college film class for a second.  Every other death scene had nice work put into it but this was a combination of over the top and under worked...all unnecessary. It was the scene I was excited for and curious on how America would top it but it didn't.<br />I felt the relationships with the female characters and the male leads were not forced as they were in the departed.  Lau Kin Ming (\\"Colin\\") was married to a writer and her role was very nice and separated his good conscience from beyond the job conscience in another element that I felt Colin should have stayed with.  And my number one thing is that Billy was undercover for less than two years and Chen Wing Yan was undercover for ten years...so the stress and intensity of ten years compared to around 2 gave me less sympathy for Billy as the movie progressed, drama and all.  Dignam is brand new, never was there and so in the original there was no one to help after the shocker death scene which made it more intense for the hero to be alone. There are other differences but these are my personal main ones.<br /><br />It's sad that America can only bring in Asians kicking people to the big theaters and any other brilliant non martial arts work has to get copied.  I guess we cannot see Asians doing anything else...?  It would be nice to see original films in theaters like The Ring, My Sassy Girl,  City On Fire (Reservoir Dogs), Shall We Dancu, Anjaane (Strangers), Riding For Thousands Of Miles as examples.  At least make a re-imagination like Magnificent Seven was of Seven Samurai and Road toPerdition was of Lone Wolf & Cub...BONUS NOTE: I can't forgive Godzilla. So I am guessing one day we may see some version of Oldboy in America or The Man From Nowhere which had only one copycat scene from Dark Knight not like Priest which was a constant copycat scene filled film...not going there today! I do feel that if we can appreciate the same stories from other countries, why not appreciate that film instead of remaking it as if never to bother? Or we can only see what we so much of whatever from whoever?<br /><br />I don't usually like remakes much and I really don't like copycats (revamps are OK after a time/redemption). I wish Raging Bull or Taxi Driver brought Martin his past due award instead of a remake. Martin Scorsese is long past due many awards in the past.  I do give props to the film makers as they did credit the ones who made the story.  Film makers who copy some one else's work without giving credit like Sanjay Gupta (Diablo Cody is in question in my mind with her 'take' on Jeni Juno, innocent or guilty, I'm not sure, hmmmm).<br /><br />Remakes and copies that are not even re-imaginations or revamps sit weird with me.  This movie is cute and if you have never seen the original like any other remake, you may enjoy it.  Why compare the two films that have been brought up in my talks with film buddies is simpley because they are connected, one is a remake.  Gotta give props and credit for where credit is do.  Even if you do like the remake more than the original, thats cool too, but it still wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the original.<br /><br />3 Stars because it is a good film, just not original.Cub...BONUS NOTE: I can't forgive Godzilla.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|I refuse to buy these versions since George Lucas saw fit to change what didn't need to be changed. Sure, the changes may seem minimal, silly even or not even a big deal and I would agree. But I find Lucas total lack of awareness/respect that there are actual fans who enjoyed the original movies to be quite galling and extraordinary. While the films maybe his creation, once the films are released, they belong to the public. It is MY choice to decide what versions of the film(s) I want to buy and since he saw fit to take away the choice to purchase the originals, I'm not buying them at all. However, my plan is to wait him out because eventually he will give us what we want I'm sure. We just have to wait a little longer for them but they will be there. I'm patient. That's all.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|This is the worst headset ever. The first set was broken within 2 weeks, amazon was awesome and replaced them. 2nd pair broke after 1 month. Too late to return to amazon and Turtle has the worst customer service ever. no phone number only email and you have to pay for everything and they MIGHT fix it and send it back.... Spend a little more and buy a different brand.. Learned my lesson the hard way.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|I watched Red State on Amazon Streaming. What a great movie. Church people with guns, ATF agents, and not your typical heroics.  ATF agents were not heroes. Actually ... there were no heroes.  Saying much else would require me to say \\"spoiler alert\\" and I won't say that. What makes it interesting is that if you were sympathetic to religious fanatics with guns, you could watch this movie and think how screwed up the ATF was.  A great movie with no typical movie fantastic escape scenarios, but excitement and thrills throughout.
0385344325|4.0|Send up the flares!!  Lee Child is back to writing a good book again.  The last two Reacher novels had me wondering if Child had hit his prime and was getting lazy.  The Affair re-establishes him as a true story teller and he gives us the Reacher we have come to expect. Always one step ahead and able to handle any situation, without being unbelievable, Reacher comes through as we would want him to.  Except for some repetition and overly chauvinistic comments, this is one of Child's best.  Let's hope he continues to stay on track.

030788743X|3.0|The book is centered around a Second Life-esque virtual world, filled with recreations of movies, books, and video games, but devoid of original content. Much like this world, Ready Player One is an entertaining read, but offers little in the way of interesting insight or well-crafted exposition.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I watched Scotty, continually voted for Scotty, and have loved Scotty.  I waited with some trepidation for the release of his first album, as many past Idols have fallen flat on their face with their debut CDs.  I can now be at ease.  All tension is gone.  I absolutely LOVED this CD from beginning to end.  I highly recommend this \\"feel good/crying\\" experience to everyone.  If you are a country music lover, you won't be disappointed.  If you are a Scotty lover, you will be estatic!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|The movie kept me in suspense even though I read the book a couple of year ago.   I went to see this movie to see if it was true to the book.  It was somewhat different from the book, but very well done in its own way.  I have read many books by the author and I love his thrillers. I am glad that the movie, although it did not match the book, it came close.
0525244581|4.0|Came on time but a little more damaged than expected. But still usable and in okay condition! (it's for school, so it doesn't really matter)
0812973992|3.0|This book had such great reviews, and the premise was very interesting, I found I had to give it a try despite enough reviews to the contrary to give me doubt..I should have listened to those reviews.  The story, or stories, is centered around the tightrope walk Phillip Petit completed between the World Trade Center towers in 1974.  The novel is constructed as a series of interconnected short stories, some with more connection than others, involving various people in New York that witness the walk, again with varying degrees of involvement. It's a sort of New York Stories meets Six Degrees of Separation, and herein lies part of the problem with the book for me..it has a movie feel to it. Some of the prose is lovely, and some of the stories are interesting, while others are just a chronicle of events and I had little interest in them. Some characters are interesting, the Irish brothers the story begins with, and some are TV/movie cardboard cutouts (the black prostitutes, the uptown women's circle).  There was air of pretentiousness in the stories that bothered me throughout the book and ultimately left me disappointed.  If you don't want to add  insult to injury, don't read the afterward with the author..if I had read that first maybe I would not have bothered with the book at all.
B0055EAJ7A|3.0|I was never too big into the Thor character to begin with. But it's part of Marvel and I am keeping up with all the movies while awaiting The Avengers.<br /><br />The story line in my opinion was weak. At the beginning it was coming off good, but once Thor was stripped of his powers, it's like everything was rushed afterwards. Had it's good bit of humor and action. But could have been better. Even my husband fell asleep during it and didn't bother to watch the parts he missed the next day.
B005FVNJTS|5.0|Hello Dear Fellow Tennis Lovers  I love playing tennis, I am 38 and I have been reading and practicing tennis for a few years now. I am intrigued by what makes a champions' mind, which is the reason I bought Rafa, the story of Rafael Nadal.  This book reinforces some of the key principles that seem to be by the side of elite people (in sports, business, anything really): a strong coach at the beginning of a career, a support group, a dissatisfaction for any achievement and always want more and strive for perfection, and immense passion for what the person does.  This book explains it all that happened to Rafa. But his success, as you will learn, did come at a price.  I also enjoyed the font of this book which made it very easy to read. I devoured the entire book (304 pages) in 3 days!  One of the key learnings I got for my own tennis is the keyword \\"endurance\\" and \\"hang in there\\". I also particularly enjoyed the style of writing: the entire book is written explaining what happened during the 2008 wimbledon final with Federer and the 2010 US Open final with Nole. Definitely a very unusual way of writing, with lots of forth and back. Beautiful!  Now I am off reading Open (Andre Agassi).
B00466HN86|5.0|As a single mom, I was a little afraid that a movie that encourages fathers towards faithfulness would be discouraging to me. I was afraid that it might poke where I hurt.   Several of my teens and I watched _Courageous_ during its opening weekend. I laughed really hard; I cried too. I was pleased that the plot had some unexpected twists. I felt the characterization was believable. Some of the one-on-one violence (punching) was a little much for my stomach, but certainly seemed to fit the plot; it wasn't gratuitous. The next morning it suddenly occurred to me that I noticed not one swear word. Not one. (Thanks, Sherwood Films!!)  Over the last 14 months much has sapped me of strength and courage, sadly, all of it coming from within the Christian community. By contrast, this movie gave me renewed strength and courage for the task before me as a single mom.   In my family, both _Fireproof_ and _Courageous_ are now mandatory viewing for everyone age 12 and up. Jesus used stories to engage hearts and minds to turn people towards Himself. _Courageous_, likewise uses a story to engage hearts and minds to turn people towards Christ and toward their God-given responsibilities as parents. I highly recommend it.   Even for single moms. :)
B005C5A6C0|4.0|So  I feel like I have listened to this album long enough to give it a well thought out review. Unto the Locust is the seventh full length album from the legendary Bay area metal group Machine Head. One of my favorite bands since I was 14. Back when MTV played videos and rap wasn't the most popular form of music, there lay a metal band that rose up from the ashes to bring us un relenting groove/ thrash metal until we crapped ourselves. Still remember hearing \\"Blistering\\" sitting in the back of my friends/ drummer's crappy Nissan truck and thinking \\" Wow, who the hell is this?, These guys rock!!\\". Several years later we are given The Blackening and to my amazement, they topped everything they had ever done in the past. Now fast forward to 2011 and we have the opus that is \\"Unto the Locust\\". This album doesn't disappoint at all and picks up right where The Blackening left off. Robb starts the album with en eerie gregorian chant and it slowly ascends into in your face thrash metal. From the get go, this album assaults your senses with an iron fist and drops like an atom bomb going off in an auditorium. I am Hell( sonata in C#) is quite possibly one of the best songs they have ever written. Classical musicians would weep and chop of their finger's if they heard what Machine Head was playing nowadays. The three parter doesn't disappoint at all. After that we have \\"Be Still and Know\\" which is another fantastic addition to the roster. This intro reminds me a little of Wasted Years from Iron Maiden but dare I say better. This song also brings to mind \\"Now I lay Thee Down\\" from the Blackening but very different. The verse riff always gives me chills as does the chorus. Don't think I need to mention the Title track as many of you have probably already heard the Advance mix but it is a fantastic song. Brutality and beauty merge together as one on this one and the track to follow . \\"Darkness Within\\" is probably one of the most in depth songs I have ever heard them write. Robb showcases his fantastic clean vocals and writes a heartfelt rock style ballad about the perils of being away from his family and touring. Some may not like this one but I think it was done tastefully and actually is a fantastic change of pace from all the thrashing in the first half of the album.  \\" Now brace yourselves and have a change of underwear handy cause \\"This is the End\\" may start off pretty and classical sounding much like Fight Fire with Fire or Battery from Metallica but we all know what happens next. Tremolo picking and blast beats ensue, then Robb tears the roof off with a tasty thrash lick in the vein of his old bands Violence and Forbidden. The breakdown sounds like it wouldn't have been out of place on The Blackening either. Next, we have Pearls Before the Swine. Yet another epic track with some of the most sinister sounding riffs they have ever played. The middle range kind of drags on with Robb's clean vocals but then get's right back on track with a fantastic guitar lead and breakneck drumming. Finally, we have \\"Who we Are\\". Intro with kids singing which actually works quite nice in this song and is great change from all of the constant head banging. Don't let the intro fool you as it gets heavy and groovy as hell right after that. Final verdict, fantastic follow up to The Blackening and a great metal record over all. Though not as shreddy or as epic sounding, still fantastic in it's own right and worth every penny. Pick it up now.

B005974C94|5.0|The Wynton Marsalis - Eric Clapton album has been glued to my cd player. Maybe more because of this incredible horn band, best I've ever heard, Marsalis and the ridiculous clarinet player Victor Goines, but Clapton fits in well with this amazing Dixieland outfit. His vocals hit the spot, mimicking Satchmo on occasion, and his guitar playing is tasty. Buy this one for the horns!
034547581X|4.0|Initially, I listened to a book on tape that just included the battle at X-ray. That was very good at building a mental picture of the horror of the battle and its casualties. Then I watched the movie which also was based on Hal Moore's fight. I saw an interview of Hal Moore where he spoke of the later ambush and the errors of  judgement that caused so many casulties. He also related his later meeting with the NVA officer who directed the opposing army tactics. Both seemed to have come to peace with the past while still mourning the losses of their men. This book encompases all 3 segments. The battle seemed easier to follow when listening to the tape and of course when watching the movie. The book seemed to have places where I lost tract of which group and at what location they were fighting. That is why I give the book 4 stars. But it sure provided an emotional kick by letting you feel the fear and uncertainty of combat.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I downloaded this as the faotd,  but didn't have the opportunity to use it right away.  I also downloaded an update for the application from Amazon.   I finally got the time to give it a try and was so disappointed! I clicked the Cut the Rope icon on my Galaxy S, and was informed that the application wasn't installed??? How can that be?!
B004LWZW42|5.0|This was a fascinating look at how the X-Men came to be. There was a lot of action and some great graphics of their powers- some of which we have never seen in the other movies. The story moved rapidly and had its own plot line so it seemed like it was part of the first series of movies. It sure answered a lot of questions of how Magneto and Mystique ended up on the opposite side. I can't make up my mind if this film is more exciting than the introductory movie where we first saw the X-Men's powers displayed.
B000V7J82S|5.0|i have a 1984 original pressing but it has signs of being used and i didn't want to ruin it by playing in in my crappy record player, instead i framed the 1984 version and got this. its a good replacement
030788743X|2.0|Ok story. Relies too much on 80's references. Not believable at all that in 2044 everyone will only be obsessed with 80's culture. What about the music, movies, etc., then and any conflict or opposite. I love the 80's but I'm not naive to think that any future generation would revolve around what I love. It's like if I developed some contest to see who knew the 1940's for a wad of cash, I'm sure the whole world would abandoned all current media for that. So, loved the 80's, but this book is ok but not Ready Player One.

0393327345|5.0|Unfortunately I saw the movie before reading the book. There are a couple of chapters and instances that were changed so the movie wouldn't be too long. Especially the times when Tyler was narrating, you can visualize the movie. Awesome book!

This book has been in my house since 1984 and the 27 year old now reads it to his little one. Get this book and you will be most happy w/ your pick.....happy reading
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Good movie just didn't line up exactly to the sorty line from the Origins of Wolverine \\"where Professor X was able to walk\\".  Over all though good movie would have like to seen a little more mutant combat but over all it was still a good movie. Purchased here on Amazon, always a good deal with digital copy included (only way they should put BR movies out).
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This was a very fun movie and a must see for anyone that considers themselves a gamer or comic fan. I made the mistake of ignoring this film when it was in theaters because of the low audience and critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. I have no idea why so many people said the movie was shallow and pointless. While it's not exactly oscar bait, this is a great movie that clearly had a lot of love put into it. Ultimately I believe the film is about empowerment and how we are all born with the weapons needed to empower ourselves to take action. The message is delivered in two very stylized worlds which may be where the problem seem to have is. One world is more like Moulin Rouge with bright colors and musical numbers. The other is a gold colored world of kick ass action sequences set in varying geek-bate locals. Maybe I liked the film more than most because I like action movies as well as musicals. Even the movie does have some sexualization of the female characters, there was no nudity and frankly I thought they were fairly strong female roles. Bottom line is that I found the film very entertaining and had characters that I cared about.
0920668372|5.0|This was the first book I bought after the birth of my son.  I absolutely love it and it brings tears to my eyes every time I read it.  My son is now a teenager and he, too, is very touched by it.  My brother and SIL are having their first baby soon so I just bought a copy for them.  It's a must-have.
0439023513|5.0|**May contain spoilers**  I just finished reading all three books within four days, and I was hesitant to begin the last book, after a few of the bad reviews. Since the middle of the second book, Catching Fire, I have found Katniss to be a little annoying, with the going back and forth between Peeta and Gale. Although I am not one for romance in these type of novels, after reading the last book I understand what Collins was trying to do. The entire series, an emphasis has been placed on Peeta's goodness, how he was better than everyone else, because he wanted the Capitol to realize that he was just more than a piece in their twisted game. Gale, contrarily, has been wanting to revolt and fight against the Capitol with weapons. Katniss just wanted to be home, essentially. And she does achieve this, by choosing Peeta, choosing to reconstruct humanity instead of destroying it (which is probably why she killed Coin). After all, the reason she never wanted to children was to not have to endure them entering a reaping.  A few other reviews have mentioned that Katniss allowed herself to be manipulated by Snow at the very end, but I had an inkling that Katniss would figure out on her own that he was partially right. Since she became the mockingjay, all she did was follow the orders of Coin. Keeping Boggs' warning in mind while he is dying (that she should not go back), in addition to Coin wanting to have another Hunger Games, Katniss finally came to realize that Coin is another Snow. That having one final Hunger Games might leave people wanting more vengeance on the Capitol's children. That is how the Hunger Games began, out of punishment/vengeance. That is why I believe, in my opinion, Katniss' decision to kill Coin was through this realization, not Snow's manipulation.  All in all, the ending of the book was excellent. I am glad Collins decided to have Katniss choose Peeta because she chose life, not destruction. That out of ashes new life can form. I loved that she endedup in 12 with Buttercup as well.
B005F6NA56|5.0|Feist's allure for me has always been those vocals--sharp enough to cut your heart like shaved glass, yet oozing into the corners like clotted cream, floating up and up, shimmering and warm, despairing and lovely.  Comparisons with Tori Amos are not unreasonable when it comes to her delivery, but her whispers of desperation are hers alone.  Music on this album hovers around the intersection of indie and alt country, a good place for her, and one which she inhabits beautifully.  \\"Little bird/have you got a key?/ Unlock the Lock inside of me...\\" she sings in the opening of the beautiful \\"Caught in a Long Wind\\", and shivers creep up and down my spine, I almost feel ashamed to listen to something so personal.  How can she share like this?  Something so beautiful?  She seems intent on wrapping her listener in layers of her soul, but is it real? Is it an illusion?  I'm not sure.  But I'm willing to keep exploring.  Sometimes, the simplest lyrics become the most profound: in \\"Bittersweet Melodies\\", she offers slips of memories, evocations of those relationships that we all have had and regret--\\"I remember us/'fore we turn to dusk/ Just when these feelings were all about/ When we still could trust/in our hearts\\".  Sometimes, for an instant, I catch a remembrance of the pure beauty of Elizabeth Fraser in her voice, and my heart catches.  This is such a mature, such a wonderful album.  I love it.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|I really don't understand why so many reviewers gave this album 3 stars or less. It is one of the best Holiday Jazz albums I've ever heard next to Ella Fitzgerald's \\"Ella Wishes You A Swingin' Christmas\\", Bette Midler's \\"Cool Yule\\", or Tony Bennett's \\"Snowfall\\" or \\"A Swingin' Christmas\\" albums (unless you're into Jazz instrumentalists like Dave Koz, Kenny G., Chris Botti, Fourplay, or Boney James). Every time I hear this album, I instantly feel as if I'm in New York City during Christmastime, walking around the streets of Times Square, enjoying the scenery at Central Park while it gently snows, or catching a glimpse of that famous Christmas tree in Rockerfeller Center. Diana makes Holiday classics like \\"Jingle Bells\\", \\"Let It Snow\\", \\"The Christmas Song\\", \\"White Christmas\\", \\"Sleigh Ride\\", etc and makes her own interpretations with a little bit of scatting, a touch of Swing influences, and her impeccable style at the piano assisted by The Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. It is a fun but also an intimately beautiful CD that honestly makes you feel that Christmas spirit. It is sure to put a smile on your face and to everyone you know.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|It's hard not to feel a little possessive about Scotty--we watched him, a remarkably mature artist for any age, branch out and really come into his own over the course of a competition that few thought that he could win. His passionate delivery, and his voice--deep as mahogany, sweet as honey--ultimately won everyone over. So how does he deliver on that promise? Wonderfully. Clear As Day is exactly what he needed to do. The songwriting is top notch, the instrumentation is good without being treacly. Lyrics are honest, and well suited for his position in life and his hopes and dreams. We've all heard Trouble with Girls by now, which boasts a gawky sincerity sung with complete conviction--a combination impossible to refuse. You Make That Look Good is a fun country rocker with a beat that will get you stomping across the floor, looking for where you might have left your Wranglers. I love how he refuses to compromise his own spirituality in the album ender--That Old King James--blending the sincerity of his faith with love of family. Ultimately, this is simply a really good country album, an album that builds on the roots of the music that Scotty loves. This music sounds so good with him because it is music that he has lived with, he has felt and meditated on, that he has experienced and yearned for with all the sincerity and heartfelt need that a teenager can bring--and that is saying something. In the process, he has created what is perhaps the best Idol debut in years. Scotty did us proud here, and if you are a fan of his marvelous voice, you won't be disappointed.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I am pretty impressed with this app.<br /><br />it is by no means a substitute for Microsoft Office,however it gives you enough in the way of editing options to get a pretty great start on just about any project.<br /><br />The word processor is,for me,the most outstanding portion of the software. The text editing and alignment. options are easy to use and translate perfectly when opened in MS Office Blue. The indentation and margin options available in OfficeSuite pro are second to none and adding pictures and media into the .docs is as easy as can be.<br /><br />There is a free dictionary and thesaurus available from Mobi that integrates perfectly into the app and extends the functionality even further.<br /><br />Using OfficeSuite Pro with a high end mobile keyboard (like Swiftkey X, FlexT9 or Thumb Keyboard) which has auto correction functions really gets you close to the power of a fully featured word processor.<br /><br />Until this I was using QuickOffice Pro. QuickOffice Pro does not offer anywhere near as useful a word processor, and it often loses formatting when importing and exporting to and from MS Word. QuickOffice Pro does not compare to this in any way.<br /><br />I own and have extensively used all of the \\"Officewhore\\" apps for the android platform,and,in my opinion OfficeSuite Pro is far ans away the best of the best.<br /><br />I am disappointed to see that the updates are not free tho. I guess you have to buy each new version. Seems a little lame,but, my 3 day old outdated version of OfficeSuite Pro is still far superior to my current version copy of QuickOffice.<br /><br />EDIT - This review was written a while ago......... Office Suite has since been FAR SURPASSED by Quick Office........ It happens......

0439023521|5.0|I'm picky on the stories I invest my time in... So I have a tendency to be harsh and focused... But this story kept me drawn in until the end... I was completely absorbed, finding myself becomeing angry and sad at Katnis story... My only wish is that I could have seen the reaction of what was happening from those she loved back in District 12. However, I realize this is her story and to be told from her point of veiw... Now I have only read this first book so I can't speak for what happens later on in this trilogy... But for book one, I can highly recommend it for anyone that loves a great story that pushes on your emotions and heart... Eaisly five stars.

0525423281|5.0|Stephanie won me over with her debut, Anna and the French Kiss and she did it again in her companion novel, Lola and the Boy Next Door. There's just something about Stephanie's writing that's magical. She makes true love real, believable and beautiful. She has this ability to transform her story into reality. Her characters feel like friends, her settings come to life and her stories leave me wanting more.<br /><br />I love the way Stephanie makes me connect with her characters, and Lola and the Boy Next Door has an amazing cast of diverse characters that I fell in love with. Aside from Lola, and Cricket are of course my favorites Anna and St. Clair who play a larger role than I thought in Lola's story, and of course loved every minute of them! Lola also has two over protective fathers. I adored these two guys! They made me laugh, they made me sigh, and they made me respect and admire them for being so involved in their daughters life. Each character in Lola's life is written in a realistic, relatable way. They're flawed, imperfect, normal, every day people.<br /><br />Lola herself is a character I laughed with, cried with and connected with the most. I like the way Stephanie created her character arc through out the course her story. Lola really grew into her own person. Her story is one about finding yourself, staying true to who you are, first love, heart break, falling in love and learning from your mistakes. There's a few things she does that made the mother side of me cringe, but the rebellious, teenage side of me totally related to. After all, growing up is all about choices and I understood why she made the choices she did. I admired her for taking responsibility for the out come of some of her actions. She's really a pretty grounded person, and I respected her for who she was. I love that she wasn't afraid to let her self shine in the way she dresses and the wigs she wears. I only wish I could pull that off the way Lola does.<br /><br />The romance in this story is fabulous! Stephanie has a talent for ripping my heart, shredded it to pieces and than fixing it. She created such a fantastic relationship between Lola and Cricket and she contrasted with that of Lola's boyfriend Max. The two relationships couldn't be any more different and I really sympathized with the emotions Lola was going on through and how she felt. Cricket! What a fabulous nerdy, boy next door, charming, respectful character he is! I adored him! The chemistry between these two is so well done and so realistic. It's so well paced and drawn out beautifully through out the story.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is a story that is simple and complex. It's touching, and gut-retching. It's witty and moving. It's brilliant and beautifully written. It's amazing and exciting. It's a story that's layered with so many emotions and realistic, relatable experiences that older teens, and adults will connect with it on many different levels. This book is a complete package of awesomeness! I highly recommend picking it up. There are a few mentions of sex, and very mild language in the book.story is fabulous!

0439023491|5.0|They say the second chapter of a trilogy is its darkest.  The stakes are heightened, the danger deepened, families torn apart and friends forced to make deadly and dire choices.  For examples of this, look to The Empire Strikes Back,The Two Towers, The Dark Knight, Mass Effect 2 and now, Suzanne Collins' Catching Fire.  It builds on the momentum established in The Hunger Games and draws the reader into the dangerous, hauntingly familiar and all too possible nation of Panem.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, victor of the last Hunger Games, should be able to retire to a peaceful life in her home district, where her winnings and fame can feed the coal miners and families she grew up supporting through illegal hunting.  However, her actions during the Games have had unforeseen consequences.  Katniss, the girl on fire, has sparked something in the hearts of her fans all over Panem, and the smoldering dissent they feel is fanning into the full-on inferno of revolution.  President Snow's wish is for Katniss to downplay this if she can, to play the Capitol's games once again.  And if she fails, it's not just Katniss' life that will suffer or even end - it's the lives of everyone and everything she loves.<br /><br />Catching Fire does two things that the middle chapters of a trilogy can and should always do: expand the world and deepen the characters.  We see more of Panem as Katniss takes her Victory Tour around the country, and characters who were given sketches of interesting pasts are more fully realized, like Haymitch and Katniss' mother.  I hesitate to mention other characters for fear of spoiling the myriad twists and turns the plot takes almost from the very beginning.<br /><br />Even moreso than The Hunger Games, this book seems nearly impossible to put down.  It seems like every few pages, there's another surprise awaiting Katniss, something that upsets her momentum or throws her into flickers of doubt and despair.  Yet this never becomes repetitive or exhausting.  The pace is so meticulous and the timing so precise that as much as the events are artificially created by Collins as the author and the rulers of Panem in the story, the flow is natural and always exciting.  And just when you think things are going to get better...<br /><br />Well, read the book, and find out.<br /><br />Catching Fire does fall a bit into the trap of some trilogy middle chapters in that it occasionally feels like a stopgap between the opening that drew us in and a conclusion that promises to rock our world.  However, for the most part, Collins' sense of pacing and character overwhelm any feelings we may have that the plot is not advancing.  The focus remains on the characters, not the events, and those characters are as brilliant as ever.<br /><br />I recommend this book as highly as I did The Hunger Games.  It's made me eager to read Mockingjay to find out what happens next, and if heading into my local library as quickly as possible to make that discovery isn't an endorsement, I don't know what is.pace is so meticulous and the timing so precise that as much as the events are artificially created by Collins as the author and the rulers of Panem in the story, the flow is natural and always exciting.

B005POK858|4.0|I found this game through \\"Symphony of Eternity\\" and I was a little bummed that some of the mechanics aren't there anymore. It takes out the ability to preemptive attack monsters by making all encounters random. Though it isn't a bad change, it takes a lot out of the gameplay.   What gets me most is the static game controls; you're stuck with the touch d-pad and interaction button with no customization. I enjoy the point to move option, or alternatively allow the player to bind controls to keys. Lastly, it cannot be stored onto your SD memory card. This may not be a problem to all users, but something definitely to be aware of, as it is close to 10MB.  Note this is all just from my first fifteen minutes of play. It is good game so far, nevertheless. The d-pad controls are fairly smooth, it's just I dislike using touchpad movement.  EDIT: From 3/5 to 4/5 Stars  Since, I've written my first review, it seems they've updated the game to allow moving to SD card(Hooray!) After logging in about 4 hours, I find this is a solid game. I enjoy the unique ability customizations.
B004MPRWJG|5.0|I was 17 when I first read this book, a year after the film came out. Unfortunately, I had seen the film before the book so I knew all the details. But being a fan of many book to film adaptations I decided to give this book a go. My God, the book is far better than I imagined. Even though I knew the ending, I couldn't help but hope she would escape from Mr. Harvey. I couldn't help but hope against hope that the ending would change, and she would go home to her loving family and live a long happy life. This book tugs at your heartstrings, even when you least expect it. It was strange, I would forget that she was dead until the realities would change, or Susie would mention something about her heaven. Alice can so clearly illustrate Susie and her story that not only can you see everything, but feel as though you are right by Susie's side both in life and in the afterlife.You'll find yourself in sync with Susie's emotions. I could sit here and go on and on about how wonderful this book is, but most likely, no one will read a page and a half review. Whatever your interests are, pick up this book. It is a lovely read, and once you being you won't be able to stop until the very end.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|It wasn't the first album by The Stooges, and some say it's not their best (see Raw Power). But this is the album that stands out for me in The Stooges catalog. Some might claim that the Velvet Underground's sonic assault on White Light/White Heat was the first proto-punk album, and you could make a case either way. But while the Velvets' secound album certainly captures the sound of electric mayhem, Fun House takes that Ur-energy and channels it for maximum effect.<br /><br />From the opening riff from Ron Asheton's guitar in \\"Down On the Street,\\" the sound grabs you by the ears. If you've heard The Stooges' debut album, you'll be amazed at the evolution of their sound here. Whereas the debut album finds the band trapped inside the songs, Fun House sees them bursting out of their own constraints. Iggy sounds like a man possessed; he alternately bellows, snarls, croons and shouts, sounding like a twenty year old Tom Waits who was just cut off in traffic.<br /><br />The songs here are much stronger than their previous efforts. While there is no tight single like \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog,\\" tracks like \\"T.V. Eye\\" and \\"Loose\\" just explode with energy. On the latter, Iggy manages to sound scarier than The Stones in '65 and the Pistols in '77. Special kudos to Steve MacKay, whose sax work on the second side of the album (tracks 5-7) make a good thing even better.<br /><br />My favorite story about Fun House comes from Henry Rollins. I'll let him tell it: \\"I was working at this construction site all by myself. I was doing busy work, moving 2 x 4's from one side of the slab to the other. The first 100 were stacked very nicely. I popped my Fun House tape in the blaster, and by the time \\"TV Eye\\" had run its course, there 2 x 4's in the street, in the dumpster, and on the roof othe unfinished garage. Not a very pretty picture, but it sure was fun.\\"<br /><br />Was and is, Henry. Was and is.
B002I0J5FG|1.0|I never thought this day would come, being the avid gamer that I am, but this is the worst collection Sony has put out to date, and I am happy to report that this game is on its way to Amazon via UPS as I type.  ICO is the most frustrating experience I've ever had the (dis)honor of playing on the PS3 system.  The controls are absolutely sluggish:  Ico does not walk where I want him to walk, and Princess Yorda does not obey his calls accurately.  In fact, making Ico having to call Yorda in order to progress through this game is a ridiculous element in any video game that I've played thus far.  Ico's calls of \\"bon-swa, bon-swa\\" were also VERY annoying. I completely agree with the other 1-star reviewer about the windmill part, too.  Luckily, I nailed it, but I considered bringing this game back about 10 tries into it!  Little did I know that the windmill experience was just a prelude to the final outcome...  What threw me over the edge was the fact that when you die, you start over from where you last saved at the couch.  RIDICULOUS!  Why couldn't they have you start over after the latest cutscene event?  After I died in the waterfall section, I absolutely had it.  No way was I going to start at the couch and do everything over again.  This was the first 3D game I played after recently purchasing a new Acer 27\\" 3D monitor, and the 3D effects were not that hot either.  Nothing really popped out of the screen, except for when the flying black spirits were coming down in the foreground.  Sure, the environments looked beautiful, but there was nothing awe-inspiring at all.  With that said, I originally bought this game at Best Buy as part of a \\"Buy 2 PS3 Collections Get $20 Off\\" deal.  So in reality, I got this collection for $29.99.  Now that I've traded it in to Amazon, I should be getting $24.30 back.  That would make my final purchase actually $5.69....not too bad at all, and that's not a lot of money spent on such an awful game.  I'm going to use my new Amazon gift card balance to get another game, for sure (maybe Mafia II or something).    And like the other 1-star reviewer, I also did not even bother playing Shadow of the Colossus.  I just ejected the disc, went on Amazon, printed the return shipping label, and speedily drove to my nearest UPS drop-off store.  This game SUCKS.

Mandelbrot presented the evolution of financial analysis over the past centuries and relayed his findings and development of fractals to each of the financial tools.  This book has reinforced my intuitive perception to the volatile nature of financial markets with scientific research and mathematical modeling.

B001DF68MA|5.0|We researched a lot of bike seats before deciding on this one.  My husband was able to install this seat in less than 30minutes.  I am short (5'1\\") and was worried about being able to see over the seat as well as riding with it in front of me.  I have a beach cruiser, and it fit with no problems whatsoever.  I am able to see over the top and it doesn't affect my riding (other than having to ride slightly more open legged).  I would recommend this seat over and over again!  My little one loves going for rides...except for the helmet part :  This is a great product, & the little extra you spend for the LTD padding is worth it!
0385344325|2.0|It's with a heavy heart that I have to write this review. As you can tell from my name and past reviews, I'm a Jack Reacher/Lee Child fan. However, in The Affair, Child really dropped the ball.<br /><br />This is about when Reacher was still a MP in the army, and was sent undercover. His job is to work with the local police to solve a murder. Reacher has a counterpart that's doing the same thing, but that person is trying to solve the murder by not going undercover, and trying to solve the murder by working at a local army base.  Soon, Reacher is in the middle of the case and trying to sort things out and soon learns that things aren't as what they seem, and someone else is pulling certain strings.  That's all I really want to say about the plot without giving to much away.<br /><br />There are a lot of things wrong with The Affair.  What draws me to Reacher, is that fact that he sees things in a way that the rest of us do not, and is able to piece together clues in a logical way and solve any problem. I guess what I'm saying is that Reacher is smart.  He's a few steps ahead of the bad guy and is waiting for him, then just smacks the crap out of them  or kills them. Game over, next game. In this, we really don't get to see that. We sort of get to see him sort somethings out, but never that \\"wow factor\\" that hooks us in. He doesn't really do it that much. He's kind of stumbling along and figures things out in a much slower way.  I just miss the old Reacher. He does smack some people around, but he could have done it much more. I won't say if he kills anyone, I don't want to spoil anything. This just isn't the Reacher  that we all know and love.<br /><br />A second problem is that this is so dang wordy.  There's a lot of description of things that we don't need to read about. It's not like it moves the story along. It's just the opposite, it slows down the pace of the story. There's also a lot of needless redundancy to it. We get told over and over and over how Reacher is eating Peach Pie. UG! There's a lot more redundancy that just the Peach Pie. There is just so much that is slows the plot down.<br /><br />Child tried to put in a few plot twists that never really worked. I think that Child had them there, just to have them and take up space.<br /><br />It seems that the plot was weak as well. The plot was weak and the outcome was weak.  I just don't think that Child put in a lot of effort in this book.  Child started off good, but soon lost it's momentum.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of the Reacher books, please don't start with this one. This isn't a good reflection on what a Reacher Adventure really is.<br /><br />For me, it was a major let down and it's one I won't be reading again.<br /><br />I'll still continue to read the next Reacher Adventure that comes out, I just hope it's the old Reacher.re's a lot more redundancy that just the Peach Pie.

B004UUKDNA|5.0|I had never heard of this group until last week. I previewed the songs on Amazon and decided to buy the CD based on what I heard. WOW! It is really good. All the songs are good and I like the album even better every time I play it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|great game. great time killer.  enjoyed the novelty of it and can see how it would appeal to all ages
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This GPS receiver is hands down the best on the market. I use it daily with MS Streets&Trips as well as NetStumbler and have had excellent results. Rain or shine (or heavy snow, sleet, hail, or a combination), you can expect it to maintain coordinate accuracy and its physical position.<br /><br />Additionally, Linux fans rejoice as this receiver IS compatible!<br /><br />Exceeds expectations. Highly Recommended.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|This game starts out fun and certainly makes you think.  However, it gets frustratingly difficult and the hint system might as well be non-existent.  Getting stuck on the same level for days is not my idea of fun.  Some of the solutions almost seem random.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was my fourth read in the Reacher novel, but the first in the series, and it was an excellent read. I started by reading books 14 (61 Hours) and 15 (Die Trying), along with One Shot, and finally ordered the rest of the books to read. It was great to see where Reacher started and this novel is a great introduction to a really great character. Killing Floor starts out with a huge bang with Reacher going to prison for a crime he didn't commit. From there the plot takes a lot of twists and turns, but all along the way, it keeps us, the reader, intrigued and excited to turn to the next page.   Great characters, and very good plot with a good amount of surprises, this novel is a great way to start off this series, or like me, just a great read even out of order. Would highly recommend this to anyone interested in suspense, thrillers, crime, and action books or movies.
0307386171|5.0|A book that you close with a sigh for the infinite regret that was suffered by the characters - all for the lack of a little experience and wisdom. Evocative and beautiful. The ending is never a foregone conclusion and we continue to hope for this young couple until the last perfectly crafted sentence.
0307938905|4.0|I like to take a moment and express my thanks to author Erin Morgenstern for creating an extraordinary world so enchanting and magical, dark and beautiful that I as a reader couldn't help but be swept away in it. All the buzz THE NIGHT CIRCUS has been receiving is well deserved in my opinion, because I absolutely loved THE NICHT CIRCUS from curious start to remarkable end.<br /><br />This is a rare read that all ages can enjoy and relate to with characters spanning the spectrum from very young to some that have lived for centuries.  The synopsis included with the book is pretty spot on when it comes to the plot itself, so I won't go into that, but do expect  that and even more, because with the multitude of characters, there are many fascinating sub-plots to pull your attention from our leads Marco and Celia and give them a run for their money. I was particularly taken with Bailey and the twins and would be excited to find a sequel in the works as they continue on with Le Cirque des Rêves as is appears and disappears around the world.<br /><br />THE NIGHT CIRCUS is such an intriguing and imaginative read, so different from most other fiction out there right now, the best comparison I can come up with is the short-lived quirky  and deliciously strange TV series Pushing Daisies of which I was a huge fan.  I wonder if Morgenstern had that in mind as well, as the narrator for THE NIGHT CIRCUS and Pushing Daisies is one in the same, Mr. Jim Dale, who was a perfect choice in both accounts.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|Mastodon has been my favorite band for a couple years now, and when I heard \\"The Hunter\\" announced; I was very excited.  I was also skeptical for many reasons as well.  I didn't know how they would follow up \\"Crack the Skye\\" and what creative direction they would take.  Then, the first song from the album was released, \\"Black Tongue\\".  Immediately I was blown away.  The song was technical and heavy, yet fluent and easy listening.  The song seemed to mirror their album \\"Leviathan\\" in terms of the song structure, but listened more like a song from \\"Crack the Skye\\".  Thus, the best sound Mastodon has had to date.  A blend of prog, sludge, and melodic capabilities all wrapped into one album.  \\"The Hunter\\" is simply awe-inspiring from track to track, begging you to replay over and over.  Each song seems to flow into each other, and every song has a unique sound.  Truly amazing what Mastodon was able to do, and the best part is the sheer breath of the album.  13 songs construct this masterpiece, and they are all truly amazing!  I tried to pick my favorite song on the album, but I couldn't pick just one song.  On most albums, you can name a 'Top 5' of the songs that are included, but not on \\"The Hunter\\".  I caught myself having a new favorite the more I listened to the album, and my 'Top 5' quickly turned into a 'Top 13'.  Great from beginning to end and a definite listen to anyone who is a fan of metal and Mastodon fans alike.  A must buy!!  Pros:  Immense depth, great songs, amazing material, and near flawless composition.  Cons:  Song length feels a little short, especially for fans of \\"Crack the Skye\\" which averages right at 5 mins each.  Favorite Songs (as of now):  'Stargasm', 'Blasteroid', \\"The Hunter', 'Curl of the Burl', 'Dry Bone Valley', and 'The Sparrow'.

B00364K6YW|1.0|I received this copy of Pride & Prejudice, the one with the green cover, in the hope that the digitally remastered version, sold as \\"the ultimate in picture and sound quality\\". I have to tell you that the picture quality, compared to one I bought in the UK 2 years ago,is simply ATROCIOUS!  It is still green and very black, without hightlights in the eyes or in the architectural details.  Have I been sent a bootleg copy for $15.49?  If you want the beautifully restored version, then buy the the one from the UK!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Very pleased with this product. Baby's cup, my cup, phone, wallet, keys....I don't have to dig in the bottom of my bag anymore. So busy Moms, messy Moms, don't like to carry lot-a-stuff Moms it was invented for us!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I suppose many people have written at length about the DVDs (and/or Blu-ray) discs and all its \\"bells and whistles\\" that come with it.<br /><br />For me, I will say this: This film has been a long time in the making. As an artist in several mediums, film included, I can relate to some simple thoughts for those wondering about the movie \\"Inception\\" itself. I met Christopher Nolan last century (weird to say) at an international film festival when \\"Memento\\" was first screened. I thought that movie was brilliantly presented and unique - as was his less successful, but still intriguing, previous venture \\"Following\\".<br /><br />The movie \\"Inception\\" was something that was on Nolan's mind for quite a long time. His problem: The trouble with creative ideas, especially when involving such a semi-uncharted realm of \\"dreams\\" as your grounded subject matter, is hard for one to convey such unique, fresh ideas into a visually physical and presentable piece.<br /><br />However, Nolan finally succeeded with \\"Inception\\". As technology (CGI) had increased exponentially for creative potentials such as bringing artists' dreams into something visceral and presentable, this film became more and more \\"do-able\\" for him as a project.<br /><br />In this century, as the art (almost seemingly lost amongst so many writers and directors lately) seems to have turned into massively (almost mindless) \\"action\\"-packed, substance-lessness groups of movie re-makes, comic books and consumer entities turned into trite-made-flesh \\"movies\\", and the seemingly endless amount of sequels (which most should have ended a few sequels back) and, along with that, the upsurge in \\"prequels\\" (have we really started running out of originality?),I personally find it more difficult to even \\"want\\" to see a movie in the theater unless its something with possible unique potential as something fresh, new and (at some point in the past) even \\"unthinkable\\" as a premise for a movie. Afterall: 2 people seeing a movie these days is a major financial investment at $10-$12+ per ticket... and gods help you if either one of you wants something edible, even simply a $5 bottle of water! And even though I'm only in my later 30s, yes, seriously kids: things were much different - and cheaper - in the 80's and 90's as a movie-going enthusiast. I suppose that's why, when you pay less for something, if it was a \\"crappy movie\\", the let down wasn't that bad. Nowadays, if something doesn't impress you, the \\"investment\\" you put into hoping to see a movie becomes something that could backfire and \\"depress\\" you.<br /><br />So I was very glad to be even moreso impressed than I was expecting when I saw \\"Inception\\". It is a fresh story which is artisticly and meticulously woven into a high-quality film which presents the idea of a world (whose time period we aren't really told, but we come to accept as either a future or a possible reality of the \\"near-present day\\" realm) where the most precious commodities that exist that we would like to think are not in another's grasp: an idea... a thought... a dream... could become something of a tangible commodity to others with an ulterior interest.<br /><br />The movie presents you with the \\"what if\\" premise that some of your most gaurded, personal thoughts and ideas, buried inside your own mind which may emerge in your own dreams, could actually be visited, viewed, experienced... and stolen. It's a disturbing thought on one hand. On the other hand, it makes for something fresh and incredibly imaginative to be explored and presented in a cinematic format.<br /><br />I won't go in depth and throw spoilers and such about the movie, because this is one of those rare movies that I personally wanted to know very little about beforehand... and walk into the theater (of for those of you now: to be able to rent or buy this film) knowing not much about what you are about to see.<br /><br />And that's why I enjoyed it so much when I saw it in the theaters. It is a fresh concept,a movie in this time of regurgitated cinema sparkle and fodder which kept me so engaged. The ideas were new, fresh and imaginative. The premises and layers (literally) of thought involved in this piece that echoes a famous line from Edgar A. Poe's writings: \\"All that we see or seem, is but a dream within a dream.\\"<br /><br />From start to finish, this may not be a movie some people will be able to fully absorb and comprehend all its beauitfully creative details and uniquities, as its pace doesn't waver to do a \\"time-out\\" for the viewing audience to try and explain it all to you - and some people may find that an irritation indemic of the \\"I want to know everything explained to me now\\" generation/group of impatient \\"movie-goers\\". However, what makes \\"Inception\\" unique is that we find ourselves somehow going along for its ride, like the finality of beginning a long roller coaster ride which, once seated, you are in for many unexpected twists, turns, and thrilling experiences along the way. You find yourself accepting things momentarily as if: \\"that's ok... this is a dream anyway... right?\\" You may even find yourself falling deeper into accepting these realms with all their ideas and concepts that defy what we assume are constants - like, oh, the laws of physics, gravity and logic. But hey it's just about a dream ...right? Well hang on, because you most likely will find yourself becoming pulled into the film, catching yourself momentarily uttering, silently, \\"Whoa, I did not see this coming,\\" and futher down the rabbit hole you go.<br /><br />As with most of Nolan's original works of the 90's, \\"Inception\\" is, in my opinion, his shining jewel. And it should be, considering how many years upon years he kept this movie as a work-in-progress in his mind (and a journal or two). Luckily, so far his guarded thoughts weren't something easily up to be stolen while he slept. It's a rewarding experience that deserves to be taken in - because honestly, how often do you see something unique in movies and say to yourself (either during or after the end credits) \\"I never saw or thought of something like that before... in my life... and I just saw it on screen\\" ...?<br /><br />It's also an experience that deserves to be watched again, because once you've seen it (like taking the red pill in \\"The Matrix\\"), there is no going back. Therefore moving forward is the only option you have. Rewatching it helps you take in more of the concepts: It is truly an amazing feat of accomplishment to bring the realm of thoughts and dreams out with ideas not oft (if ever) explored in past films that somehow work incredibly well together here. The visual beauty of the work of the cinematic art in its entirity (and all its little details). Nolan insisted continually through this movie to physically film things visually in the real-life recording moments themselves as much as humanly (and safely) possible, only ending with astoundingly artiful merging of additions and touch-ups with the usage of CGI to blend in what couldn't be physically filmed in real life... and trust me, some of the things you see make you feel a sense of accepting the unlimited possibilities that can be explored in the future of movies, stories, etc involving the subject matter of our consciousness... and our sub/unconsciousness.<br /><br />And on an extra note (as a person who works in the music industry): the sound engineering was amazing and its accolades and awards were justified - exceeding (and shocking) my own expectations.<br /><br />The Blu-ray 2-disc edition is what I purchased, and I found it to be rewarding enough to see how many of the visually stunning scenes were created and even how the sound engineering was accomplished! It was also shocking to see how many of the scenes were shot - including what I thought was CGI which turned out to be real... etc etc. This would be one of the few movies I own whose \\"extras\\" I found myself interested in watching entirely. I believe there is anoption to \\"interrupt\\" the movie momentarily to view \\"how they did that scene you just watched\\" during the movie, but they are just as easily accessible as parts to watch on their own.<br /><br />Again, this movie will inevitably beg for you to watch it again... and you don't want to be interrupting it every 10 or 15 minutes to see some behind the scenes moment DURING the movie. Maybe save that for the 3rd+ time you've seen it, if you're into that. Because hands down, this was one of those rare movies I said to myself: \\"Finally! Something original, creative, beautiful, imaginative and not wavering and bending over backwards to 'meet' or 'fit' into the seemingly typical Hollywood format of what Hollywood considers the 'proper format' of how a movie 'has to be' in order to make money.\\"<br /><br />Because it worked fine all on its own. I believe the Oscar awards spoke up on their own earlier this year as well.<br /><br />Jason Kraleyought of something like that before... in my life... and I just saw it on screen\\" ...?

B0055V6EZE|3.0|I like the choice of songs and there is nothing wrong with the playing of the instruments--although there is a certain careful polish to the playing...it lacks a certain rough passion that I like in blues.  I almost get the feeling that Laurie wanted the playing to be perfect and thus didn't take chances, nor jam enough.  It would have been fun to hear some out-takes or jamming.<br /><br />The voice Laurie uses is fine for one song, but it sounds a bit affected when used on all of them. This too feels too practiced...I would have liked to hear him try and jam on the voice, vary it, grunt and groan a bit...play one song after a few \\"pints\\" or shots of whiskey.<br /><br />While a few are criticizing him because he is already famous--and calling this a vanity album--I think that one has to give credit in that when you love the blues and jazz as much as Laurie does, that it takes a certain amount of courage to put out an album like this.  I think that if he can relax a bit and do a few nightclub gigs after this album where he experiments with the songs more, that a second album may be better than the first, especially the voice.  Sing a few with a natural British accent...relax...blues and jazz are about improvisation!<br /><br />Bottom line, worth listening to, but I hope he does better on a second one, if he does a second one.  Laurie is lucky he gets to follow one of his passions in addition to his \\"day job.\\"
B005CM9DX6|5.0|No growls on this one so automatically 75% of the \\"die-hard fans\\" turn the other cheek when \\"Heritage\\" starts off. I personally am glad that I can go to an Opeth concert now without little 15 yr olds overcrowding the place. I can't stop playing this album. I have listened to it EVERYDAY. Seriously! Even if you are a skeptic about \\"Heritage\\", just listen to it all about 5 times and it WILL grow on you. His voice rocks and the band is incredible! LONG LIVE OPETH!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005DB7NHO|5.0|This was a fast fun read. I made it through in just two days. It feels like the boys are speaking right to you and you really do learn a lot of cool facts about them, the show (X Factor) and their journey to becoming pop starts. I really liked how the book was organised. Each guy has a chapter in which they pretty much cover similar details. That may sound boring to you but it is actually cool because you get each of their perspectives. At the end of each of their chapter is a good list of random facts. All throughout there are pictures - quite a few of them so the book isn't as long as it looks.
B005HPA2XI|4.0|Mastodon are back!  I was so excited for this album after hearing 'Black Tongue' this summer, I could hardly stand the wait.  I went up to Washington to see them open for Soundgarden.  I checked their website religiously for updates, and then I heard the single for 'Curl of the Burl' and I was pissed!  I couldn't believe the simplistic, QOTSA drivel that spewed forth from my speakers.  I tried not to let it get to me.    \\"No one bats 1000,\\" I told myself.  \\"The rest of the album will be like Black Tongue and kick ass.\\"  On first listen I began to mourn the passing of yet another fantastic band.  The new songs were mellower, simpler, and shorter.  I couldn't believe my ears.  Being the discerning listener I am, of course I had to give it a few more rides in the player before I made my judgement.  Boy, am I ever glad I did!  After a few listens I gradually became more and more hooked and now, like a financially-challenged inner city youth at Mickey D's, Im lovin' it!  Black Tongue is a highlight, it sounds like it could easily have found a place on Blood Mountain.  Curl of the Burl was redeemed with the video, but it's still the weakest track aside from the Creature.  The Hunter, Dry Bone Valley, and The Thickening are also great.  The Sparrow is ridiculously good, sort of mellow and spacey, then it builds to a huge climax before easing back out.  There are a lot of new vocal delivery styles on display here, and it's pretty (gasp) fun to listen to.    It's quite different from their other offerings but give it a chance to penetrate your thick skull and you'll be pleased.  I consider Leviathan, Blood Mountain, and Crack the Skye 5 star albums.  With Remission at a 3.5 I'd put this at a solid 4.    Unless you're 16 and have a small weiner in which case you would say \\"YoU dOnT kno wUt Ur taLkiNg aBouT!  ThEy soLd ouT aNd donT ScReaM NEmore!!\\"
B005FNSJDC|5.0|Very diverse. Beautiful, emotive, and rich. Well played and well recorded, mixed and produced. A true creative gem! Buy it now!
B005CM9DX6|3.0|So I purchased this album (from a local store for you 'verified purchase' babies) a couple of days ago, put it in my CD Player with a huge you-know-what-eating grin on my face and hit the Interstate for a 2 hour drive.  My grin slowly faded as I checked the cover again to make sure I hadn't been hoodwinked.    \\"Yup, this IS Opeth\\" I told myself.  So much for that excuse.  I absolutely LOVE Opeth and think Akerfeldt is a tremendous talent.  I think Damnation is one of their best.  I love all sorts of music and have no problem with artists venturing into new territory.  I assumed it was just a grower, and have listened to it about 10 times now.  Thing is...it's not growing on me.    There are some fantastic parts all over this album, and that's about all I can say.  It's sort of like when you were a kid and made a 'suicide' Big Gulp at 7-11.  All the sodas are really good on their own, but when you mix them all together it kind of tastes like poop.  All is not lost, however.  Due to my intense faith in the songwriting genius of Mikael Akerfeldt, I am chalking my experience up to the fact that I dwell on a lower plane of understanding and it just takes longer for my feeble mind to soak up Heritage's inherent awesomeness.  Or not.   3 stars for the benefit of the doubt.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|This DVD featuring Jeff Beck supported by other great musical artists honors the songs of Les Paul.  This was a magnificent TV special and a disc that should be in everyones collection.

B005RUS7LC|5.0|I thought we were pretty much down to one of the following, or all of them, would die shortly.  This would include Walt, Gus, Jesse, Hank and Mike.  So I didn't think the ante could be upped any further but I was wrong. Personally, I was on the edge of my seat all during this episode because I never expected that the sphere of death would radiate further out than that. The creators have not even made it super clear who is the one who just perpetrated the latest heinous act of probable murder, which does affect yet another character, and a very sympathetic one at that.<br /><br />Many characters are scrambling for protection with the DEA or leaving town altogether.  It is primarily Walt who is still out there in the open.  So is Jesse if he breaks the present \\"cooking\\" understanding with Gus. This show has one more season planned so obviously not everyone can be killed as we come to the close of this season.  i would be surprised if we did not have some deaths take place though.<br /><br />It is interesting to me how everyone with the DEA is fooled by Gus's Chicken King and philanthropist front.  They just will not listen to Hank, who has got both the right place and the right culprit picked out. One hopes the real DEA is not this lacking in long range vision.
1423140591|5.0|I don't want to spoil any plot details, so I'm going to deal in generalities.<br /><br />For longtime fans of the series, prepare to be hit with waves of nostalgia. One of the stars of this book is Percy Jackson, who despite losing his memory is still the same awesome character that he was in the previous series. As the book unfolds, more and more elements of the previous series are added into the mix. While there are a few new things done to him, I assume most fans would be happy as I was that this was good ol' Percy Jackson. The gods don't make as much of an appearance in this book as they did in the last, but there is a new spin on a few and some interesting new ones are introduced.<br /><br />Not lagging far behind are the new characters from Camp Jupiter. While they aren't Percy, they are fun characters in their own right. Frank and Hazel come off very strongly and put a different spin on being a demigod. The supporting cast does its job well and you come off liking and hating who you're supposed to. Riordan doesn't reuse old character molds but instead invents new ones. The dynamic of Camp Jupiter itself is wholly opposite of Camp Half-Blood, yet just as feasible.<br /><br />The story itself flows very well, old characters mix with the new and the experience is like the quest the characters embark on. While there was a cliffhanger at the end, altogether this was a very good book (4 1/2 stars) and I cannot wait for the Mark of Athena in 2012. (I'm pretty sure we know who that will be about)<br /><br />On a side note, one of my biggest complaints is not for Riordan, but for Amazon and I know I'm not the only one complaining. The Kindle version was riddled with typos that could have easily been fixed if they had proofread it even once. This was a shabby effort for Amazon for a book that was #1 on its chart. Edit: Thank You Amazon for resolving this, there should have been no need for it though.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Some people would say this album is overrated, others would refuse to like this album because of Water's ego, and a few would just not like it because of their musical taste. Whatever people would say about this album, In my opinion this is a very solid album. 'In The Flesh' shows the energy in this album, while 'Another Brick In The Wall (part 1, 2, and 3) shows Water's emotions Gradually going from a cold, sad tone to a more furious tone. There are classics like 'Hey You' and 'Comfortably Numb' which comes with great guitar solos from Gilmour. The album has multiple themes and symbolisms, the most notable is the WW2 theme. It's not really clear what 'The Wall' means in this album, but it is really up to you. The Wall might be the Berlin Wall, or Society, or the Struggles of your lives. Whatever the wall might mean to you, for me 'The Wall' is a very solid album that I would recommend anybody to listen to.
B004EPZ00W|5.0|I love baseball. Played 14 seasons growing up. Even helped win some championships. Batting was always my favorite. There's nothing more intense than standing there, staring down that pitcher, bat twisting between your palms, waiting for the ball to come whipping out of that hand at insane speeds. Watching the pitch come flying toward the plate is the only way I've ever experienced bullet time, and the satisfaction of tracking a curveball in perceived slow motion until it smacks into the sweet spot of your bat can't be matched. Fielding was good too. I mostly played pitcher, first, second, shortstop, third, left, right, and center. Plus, when my dad was the manager, every night he'd look over all of the team's stats with me and spend hours agonizing over how to arrange the team to create the perfect fun/success ratio.<br /><br />What I'm saying is, I know a thing or two about baseball, so when I go to a movie on the subject, I expect a lot, and if they don't get it right, I'll tear into it with a passion.<br /><br />They got it right.<br /><br />But then again, it almost wasn't a baseball movie. Brad Pitt plays Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane at a time when the team's just lost its three star players. Faced with the difficulty of getting new hotshots on a bare bones budget, Beane turns to economy major Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Brand convinces Beane that stars don't win games. Runs win games, and runs aren't scored with big hits and amazing plays in the field. They're scored by getting on base.<br /><br />Beane takes this advice to heart and throws out all the conventional wisdom of baseball sages, willing to hire players who don't know anything about fielding as long as they can take pitches and end up with a walk. Most of the film is about people who think they know baseball not believing in this new system and Beane trying to stick with it in the face of early failure. Like I said, it's not a baseball movie.<br /><br />But The Social Network was a movie about computer programming, and if they can make that exciting, I guess they can do it with anything. Brad Pitt helps with a great performance as the conflicted manager, and Jonah Hill is surprisingly good. The success of the film rests squarely on their shoulders, and while shots of endless statistics scrolling across a computer screen are a little cheesy, they're not that bad. As the film builds up the hopelessness of being such a monetarily poor team, you can't help but root for them. Right from the beginning, you'll be emotionally hooked, and it won't let up until the very end.<br /><br />One of the cool differences about this underdog story is that the characters aren't stars. The power wasn't inside them all along. Instead, you're rooting for the players to get walks, to get hit by pitches, to hit scrappy singles, to allow runs to score on a bunt and take the easy out. The movie gets around this by making the climax not about a championship, but about the potential for a record-breaking winning streak, and man is it exciting.<br /><br />Another key difference is that, for something advertised as a pure sports drama, it's surprisingly funny. I think I laughed harder at this than at The Hangover 2. In fact, I think it's the funniest movie I've been to this year.<br /><br />This movie makes you believe. It's makes you believe on the same level as Remember the Titans or any of the great sports movies, except you believe not in the players, but in the power of statistics, and for some reason you care. When the other characters in the film refuse to believe, when they work at every opportunity to undermine and diminish our hero, Statistics, you want to punch them in their grubby little faces. I love when a film can really make me despise somebody, and Moneyball pulls it off.<br /><br />If you love baseball or Brad Pitt or sports movies or economics or feeling emotions or laughing or good cinema in general, go see this movie. It's worth your time.<br /><br />Check outmore on \\"The Nickel Screen\\" (google it!)
B002ZG98FU|4.0|This is yet another variation on a basic Hollywood formula movie - a few name actors, up and down struggles followed by happy resolution, the tension between career and personal life, friends supporting each other, heartless and selfish corporate bosses, older people who still \\"have it\\", a little casual sex, and no deep message or purpose.  I have to like a movie, however, that made me laugh really hard, smile a lot, and like the characters.  I also found the story a good parody on TV morning variety shows.  Moring Glory makes a nice \\"date\\" movie, or fluffy escape after a hard work week.

B0058WFO06|5.0|I was waiting for this album since Steven Wilson announced He is going to release it. I pre ordered it and for couple of days  am truly amazed what a great talent this artist is!! It is not for everyone, since it is an artwork and has to be listened as such. It is more like a movie score and very visual !!!!! Steven never gave in to the pressure to make music so someone would like it, He has created what He believes He should!! That is a courageous thing to do and that is a signature of a true artist. Thanks, Steven.
B003Y38YFS|5.0|I LOVE the Crocs Adrina!!!!  I have them in an 8M and they run true to size.  I get so many compliments on them and when I tell people that they're Crocs, they can't believe it!!!!  And, on top of their being super cute, they're super comfortable!!!
B0052TDGQO|5.0|LOVE this album. Scotty was my favorite on Idol, but I was a little worried after the release of his uber-cheesy single, \\"I Love You This Big\\". If you're debating whether or not to buy this album based on his first single, BUY THE ALBUM! \\"I Love You This Big\\" is by far the worst song on it. I'm normally the type that will like one or two songs on an album and that's it. Not the case with Scotty's debut. It has a great variety of songs and it really captures the range his voice is capable of. If I didn't know this was a 17 year old's debut album, I would never guess it on my own. It sounds like an artist who has been around for a while....we can look forward to more great things from this kid!

B0056BMK6K|5.0|How I sold 5 Million eBooks in 5 Months is a vital resource for authors wishing to promote themselves.  After initially reading the book, the content seemed to take broad strokes at promotional solutions, but that was deceiving. After going back through his examples and explanations, I definitely found gems of wisdom - they can be subtle...but they are there.<br /><br />As a \\"How to\\" book, the content moves more quickly than other books of its kind, and like Locke's fiction, gets straight to the point. I will not bullet point all of Locke's secrets in this review, as that is for the reader to discover after his purchase. But there are two specific items I wish to share about the book.<br /><br />1) Read his examples. And when finished...read them again.<br /><br />2) The underlying theme about social networking is the importance of reciprocity. John Locke stresses this on many occasions. And unlike many \\"How to\\" books, his message is done with a sincerity that most authors lack. Locke explains in detail the how helping one another is the foundation of success.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for every author -  whether self-published, small press, or mainstream.
030788743X|5.0|There is not much to say here that has not already been said, but for any person still debating whether or not they should obtain this fine book, I say, \\"Go for it.\\" This was the most fun I have had reading a book in some time.
0060853972|4.0|Over all the book was good, not quite a 4 out of 5, but not a 3 out of 5. More like a 3.5 out of 5. I love Neil Gaiman, I really like Terry Pratchett. So together I would love a book they worked on together. My wife and many of my friends loved the book and would rate it a 6 out of 5. So why did I find it wanting? I think this could be a case were a movie would be much better than the book. Let's hope they make a movie.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|The legs are about pencil thin, with a weak plastic. However; they are only built to hold the iPhone, so they are just fine.  The clip holder is adjustable for different cameras and phones. With tilt and swivel action.  It does a great job of counteracting the weight if it's off balance.  I bought this because I post a lot of videos on playing guitar.  This was perfect for that, plus funny moments when feeding my 9 month old nephew.  This is your average desktop style tripod, but well tuned and worth the price.  I got it in ahead of time and no damages with the packaging.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why? Why bother?  Could you imagine what would happen if Mr. Lucas had access to time travel? Lincoln would have shot first. Hitler's ghost would look like a younger version of himself. The evolutionary line of all animals would have been altered so that even arthropods and fish could blink. Lucas would have painted rocks in front of the Mona Lisa. There would be more young men drafted into wars because Lucas always wanted there to be more troopers, and they would all sound the same. All credit for Empire and Jedi would have gone to him.  Grow up, George.
B0019BI1FA|4.0|I have always liked Oscar Wilde. He was witty, brilliant, and unfortunately either gay and/or bisexual in a time when being so was a serious crime. This set includes his most famous plays.  Regretfully, the quality of the dvd's are not good.  I was only able to watch The \\"Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" which I thought was done well.  I am sure I just got a bad copy, so  if you are lucky and get a good one and you like Oscar Wilde, buy it. I am going to find a good VHS copy. Incidentally, LILLIE, the series about Lilly Langtree has a lot of Oscar Wilde in it and probably shows him as he was.   .
B004JK61K0|4.0|I really like this email app, especially the color-coding for different accounts, the unified inbox, and Select All. But the one thing that drives me nuts is that if I open the app from the home screen icon, the notification symbol in my task bar/notification area doesn't disappear. I have to clear that notification separately. Gmail can detect when the app opens and remove the notifier, and even the default droid client did it. It shouldn't be asking too much. I'll keep using K-9 because the positives are far greater, but I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't make me take an extra step to clear that notification.

0807014273|4.0|I'm not sure what brought Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning in my hands on Rosh Hashanah .  Maybe it is the \\"meta\\" feeling of the High Holiday.  The High Holidays can be a letdown.  The liturgy, the long hours in the synagogue, the archaic and sometimes alienating images of a God who is King (and male) who rewards and punishes, who inscribes people in book of life or a book of death.  All these concepts can be profound (after all, what else is more important than life and death) but also difficult to grasp, even in ten days, even with all one's strength and attention.  So, Frankl's book on \\"existential\\" psychology probably acted as a counterweight to grand theories of life and death.  By definition, existentialism tries to avoid overarching \\"meaning\\" systems.  For Frankl, a survivor of the Nazi death camps, there is only the moment, and how we frame the meaning of that moment.  Frankl's book gives numerous examples of how this is done, and that is the meat of the book.  Toward the end, there are silly sections about the therapeutic school he founded based on these insights, replete with technical jargon that sounds outdated and odd.  But that is not the lesson we should take away from Man's Search for Meaning.  Finding meaning, God, self, love, are ongoing activities, happening at every single moment.  It never ends.  When we stop trying to find a meaning in each moment, we fall into a torpor which is a kind of death.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|Let Them Talk is a terrific album of New Orleans<br />influenced standards. Laurie can play the ivories with the best of them (try the boogie woogie strains on Swanee River) and the horns of Toussiant.<br />This album has the feel of a nightclub in rural Alabama or Loos-iana and the restraint to overstate the blues or jazz is simply breathtaking.<br />The winds.....clarinet and tenor sax are phenomnenal as is Sir Tom Jones and Irma Thomas'<br />guest appearances along with Dr. John.<br />Buy this for yourself and then buy another for a friend......you'll get your thanks for showing how \\"less is more.\\"

0385523912|5.0|This was a fascinating read that dispelled a bit of the mystery surrounding North Korea. The book follows the lives of several ordinary North Koreans in North Korea until the time they defect. Demick writes with feeling, but manages to keep her own opinions out of the narrative. The characters' stories are almost unbelievable in the amount of suffering they endured, but they speak to the resilience of the human spirit.
B005F6NA5G|5.0|Four and a half SPLENDID Stars. Ten-time Grammy-winning jazz guitar legend George Benson serves up wide-ranging, wonderful renditions of mostly pop, rock, and R&B standards that are delivered in the prime Benson mode of suave vocals, dazzling solo guitar pieces which are marvels of virtuosity, and cohesive group performances which are inventive, funky, and hard-swinging. The 'best of the best' begins with 'Tenderly\\": a lovely swirling guitar solo with fiery runs that pleads the case for a Benson solo guitar recording. Coltrane's \\"Naima\\" begins as a blazing solo guitar exposition that becomes a quartet excursion, with a great David Garfield piano solo. A hard-swinging \\"Tequila\\" recalls Wes Montgomery but with those distinctive Benson note clusters and overtones, with a hard backbeat from drummer Harvey Mason and telling interlude from bassist Ben Williams. A beautiful, funky rendition of Rod Temperton's \\"The Lady In My Life\\" will remind many of the \\"Thriller\\"-era Michael Jackson. A fantastic \\"Danny Boy\\" is a distinctive solo with enough grace notes,  pizzazz, and pacing to avoid any melancholy, as Benson alludes to multiple guitars. \\"Since I Fell For You\\" and \\"My One and Only Love\\" are beautifully sung with Joe Sample on piano on the latter.  A vamping \\"Fingerlero\\" is in the prime-time jazz area code with Benson doing the head and solo in his virturally patented voice/guitar unison manner with Sample soloing inventively on piano. Entering his 6th decade of excellence with over 30 recordings to his credit, George Benson gives us a wonderfully enjoyable recording that had me hitting the repeat button. Encore, Mr Benson! Highly Recommended. Four and a half DYNAMIC Stars! (Based on an mp3 download of 12 tracks; Total time: ~43m:22s)
B00003CXB4|4.0|This movie is epic. I ordered the 2-disc Platinum edition on Amazon. It was supposed to be wide-screen but is not. But I still love it. You must own this movie.
B002ZG9846|5.0|A lot has been said about this movie, so my goal here is to say just my little piece on this movie because I feel strong enough about it to do so. First of all this movie came straight out of left field, was not expecting the violence & \\"Hit Girl\\" character. I was not very interested in the title, found it uninteresting, never heard about it(bombed at the box office) & thought it was a kids movie. But like many, when it comes to superheroes, of any kind, there is some kind of draw & attraction so I went ahead & rented the DVD. O.K I won't be philosophical or anything but this is the truth, after watching the movie I was not the same, better or worse, mainly because of hit girl!. I was not sure how I fellt about her character. I finally decided that I was was in awe of Hit Girl. This type of character with the child standing up to the adults had been done before, but not like this! Obviously for those who don't see any positives being portrayed never saw that Cages character as a little insane. Yes he is insane with hate for the murder of his wife and his daughter's stolen youth because of it. He loves his daughter obviously & she loves him. But it's his insanity that allows HIt Girl to exist. His cop friend also is the voice of reason in the movie. But, just like us, he smiled when Hit Girl kicked the bad guys ass at the \\"Kick Ass/Big Daddy Execution\\".   Come on people, this is entertainment! How many movies can you say made such a controversy & like me made me feel changed for better or worse for just watching it. This Hit Girl character took guts to portray. Child characters that taunt & even kill adults is not new. Remember \\"The Children\\", \\"The Omen\\", \\"The Exorcist\\",& \\"The Bad Seed\\" just to name a few. At least Hit Girl was exterminating bad guys. Anyway, we all have choice. If you don't want your family to see this movie, check the rating before watching & turn it off if you get a surprise because you did not check the rating & investigate the movie before watching it, like me (I watched everything though about 4 times). The sequel should be called \\"Hit Girl Kicks ASS\\"  I feel better now!
B005OT2YVA|2.0|mediocre at best Story line was bad; dry and predictable only action scenes drew interest. they used one liners from previous movies.
0802473156|4.0|Highly recommend this book. It will help a lot of relationships thrive. You certainly will be glad you got it.
B005POK858|4.0|The gameplay, appearance and feel are just like the old school RGPs that hooked me on the genre.  I am only about 30 minutes in, but am hooked. The music and most sound effects are classic to this style of game, but the constant piano cord that chimes every time a &quot;key&quot; is presses is extremely annoying. Game would be a 5 star if the option could be turned off or an update fixed this.
0393072231|4.0|There are a lot of books and movies out there about what happened in 2008. I liked this book because it offers a more detailed and close view of what happened until then, starting with the invention of the CDOs and CDSs and the people who bought/sold them. It's sad to see how a handful of people was able to play with so much money, which didn't really belong to them. Essentially it's a story about greed and how everybody involved in that game made a lot of money no matter which side lost later.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|this is a great game but the whole trying to get on and landing the airship is really annoying. The developers need to put out an update that fixes the issue. I recommend a button on the world map that will allow you to board and land the airship with ease.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I discovered Opeth a few years ago when I read a blog from Mike Portnoy (Dream Theatre) who raved about Opeth during their tour. I immediately went out and bought 2 CDS. Very excitedly I inserted this first CD into my player when I got home and quickly my enthusiasm went down the drain. The first 15 minutes or so was full of the \\"growl\\" part of Opeth. I thought to myself--\\"oh my what did I get myself into\\". Then it changed and I saw the talent and musicianship of the band. I had learned after a while to just accept the \\"growl\\" as part of what they do and focused on the more melodic part of the band. I am delighted to say that the new CD has no growling. On the other hand, the new CD is a very mature album---intricate, melodic, and spellbinding. I truly hope that this is the direction the band plans to take---not only for my ears, but for Mike's voice. The \\"growl\\" has got to be tearing up his vocal chords. Bottom line--awesome prog rock and highly recommended.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|The soundtrack to \\"Burlesque\\" offers up some excellent music with amazing songs performed by Cher and Christina Aguilera. I enjoy this CD often and I find the music to be spirited, attention grabbing and remarkably well done. The quality of the sound is excellent as well. True, I would have liked another song by Cher; but what we get is nothing short of five star, high quality control music.<br /><br />The album starts with Christina Aguilera belting out \\"Something's Got a Hold on Me;\\" and she doesn't miss a beat! Christina really opens up for this retro-sounding pop song (partly written and then performed by Etta James) and it's a great first song for the soundtrack; it sets a positive tone as well. Cher performs \\"Welcome to Burlesque\\" with lots of sensuality; her voice really hasn't diminished with time and that's pretty impressive. The music uses drums, violin and more to accompany Cher very well as she sings; and it all holds its own very well. \\"Tough Lover\\" has Christina Aguilera singing and belting it all out so well; \\"Tough Lover\\" exudes sexuality as Christina does this one up strong, rough and full of growls that sound so great! \\"But I Am a Good Girl\\" has a cabaret/nightclub flavor to it and Christina sings this so well that she never lets go of a single superfluous note.<br /><br />\\"Guy What Takes His Time\\" may not be the newest song; but in Christina's more than capable hands it sounds fresh, new and hot as anything! This is easily a highlight of the album; and just one listen proves it. The jazzy musical arrangement projects sexuality yet again while \\"Express\\" switches gears for a much more modern sounding number. Christina belts it all out yet again and the backup chorus enhances the tune really well. Cher's \\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\\" is terrifically poignant and \\"Bound to You\\" also moves me with its natural beauty. The album then ends with two fantastic numbers, the electric \\"Show Me How You Burlesque\\" and \\"The Beautiful People.\\"<br /><br />These songs from the soundtrack to \\"Burlesque\\" are so incredibly good and memorable that you can enjoy this album even if you haven't yet seen the movie. I recommend this for fans of Cher and Christina Aguilera; and people who enjoy eclectic mixes of modern music with strong, brilliant renditions of classic songs would do well to get this album.o \\"Burlesque\\" are so incredibly good and memorable that you can enjoy this album even if you haven't yet seen the movie.

B000UAFDP2|3.0|Poor Robert Heinlein must be rolling over in his grave every time someone watches this. It's an entertaining movie, to be sure, but zit is full of ridiculous bits and mashes the book up in a disjointed way, leaving some aspects confusing for those who have not read the book. It is not well explained just why they have to use infantry and not simply bombard the planet from outer space, nor is the whole Citizen/Non-Citizen angle explained very well. The whole bonding process with Zim is only briefly touched upon and is quite a pleasing part of the book, especially when you later see Zim as a Private with a brain-bug in tow. In short, this movie is the barest cross-section of the book, and should be viewed in conjunction of the book. R. Heinlein is every bit as lewd in the book as Voerhoeven is in the movie, so don't worry about puritanical writing. If anything, R.H. is *less* socially acceptable than the director. All-in-all this movie is a must-see, for some reason, but don't think that it is even close to the whole story.

0062073567|5.0|I've been a Christie fan since 8th grade and have read them all so many times that I always remember whodunit. Nevertheless, I find them a relaxing and enjoyable read when I'm taking a break from more weighty fiction.<br /><br />This is one of the finest examples of the genre- I still remember being shocked at the murderer the first time I read this book.  Hercule Poirot was certainly on his game when he tackled this country house mystery.  Though Hastings and Inspector Japp were absent, it was delightful to get a fresh perspective on Poirot from the narrator, a country doctor with an inquisitive sister.  Certainly an excellent read for any mystery fan, and an excellent introduction to Christie for the uninitiated.
B005F6NA5G|5.0|By going back to his guitar roots, George Benson has once again proven that he's among the most influential jazz musicians of all time. This new CD is soothing and exciting at once with a fresh approach to familiar songs. Very glad to know that Mr. Benson is still able to play amazingly complex guitar. Highly recommend this if you like guitar, jazz, or just want to experience a legend doing his thang!
B0052FG8KO|5.0|I have never written a review about a band until today...you HAVE to buy this album if you are reading this.   This is by far the best AOR band around.  Every song on this album is perfectly constructed.  They really upped the scale for future AOR/Melodic Rock bands.  I have many other AOR bands/albums, Lionville, White Widdow, Eclipse, W.E.T, Xorigin, F.M., Khymera, and so on.  None of those bands, and I repeat, NONE OF THOSE BANDS albums can even COMPARE to this album and band.  The only band that is similar would be W.E.T only because they have the same guitarist/song writer, Robert Sall.  In my opinion, I think Lars Safsund is a better singer than Jeff Scott Soto.  Lars's voice is more \\"radio-catchy-pop\\" in my opinion.  The production of this album is unbelievable.  Their opening track \\"The Rain\\" will get you hooked onto the sound of Work of Art and will leave you dying for more.  The choruses on this album will be stuck in your head for weeks! This band needs to be a lot more famous then they are, no melodic rock band compares to them, seriously. Enough writing, BUY THIS ALBUM YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!

B004LWZW42|5.0|I've always loved the X-Men movies, but they were nowhere near true to their source material.  First Class gathers the source material together and stems purely from it and ignores the horror that was Wolverine: Origins (which was so awful I literally did not recognize many of the characters for who they were supposed to be until their names were said aloud).  Keep in mind that this movie is NOT an pure action flick. Most of the movie is spent unraveling the back story between Erik and Charles, as well as the mutant academy itself. There are very good action sequences, however. Just don't expect constant mutant vs. mutant fights.  Like older movies, it takes its time to tell the tale and is therefore longer than a summer Blockbuster.  It does have points where it does not coincide with the source material (as well adaptations will, but certainly nothing as offensive as Phoenix being Jean Grey's \\"other personality\\" rather than a space entity that destroys planets), but as an X-Men movie and a movie in general it is definitely worth a buy.
1439192812|5.0|*****<br />\\"a beautiful, accessible and wide ranging volume that addresses the questions that all of us have about the universe, separating often too-little known facts from too-frequently believed fictions...powerful resource for people of all ages, written with the masterful and eloquently literate style of perhaps the best popular expositor of science, Richard Dawkins, and delightfully illustrated by Dave McKean.\\"--Lawrence Krauss, Director of ASU Origins Project<br />*<br /><br />When Indira Gandhi was a little girl of ten, her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, was busy in faraway Allahabad. Over the summer, Nehru wrote her a series of letters in which he told her the story of how the earth was made, how animal life began, and how human societies and civilizations evolved all over the world. These letters inspired Indira to think and prepared her to be India's first woman leader. Richard Dawkins takes the same discovery road writing a letter to his ten year old daughter, describing the different ways we come to know things, which may have eventually flowered in a book about the magical knowledge for young people.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins, the internationally renowned evolutionary biologist, and passionate advocates of science education, spent his career explaining science discoveries to curious readers. He takes over an original project, utilizing his elaborating talent to share the mysteries of science with readers of all ages. He has teamed up with an acclaimed artist Dave McKean to portray for everyone the secrets of our world, how the world works in an illustrated guide to the universe and its wonders, a project of discovery for years to come. \\"The Magic of Reality\\" takes the reader into a fantastic tour to explore a stunning spectrum of cosmic phenomena.<br /><br />Inviting to the universe amazing facts, through original mentally bright experiments, packed with dazzling illustrations. These magical journeys create a jaw dropping exhilaration, upon discovering the awesome 'real' answers to these basic questions. How old is the universe? What are its building components? How the human race came to life? Why do the continents look like torn pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that used to fit together? What causes tidal and seismic waves? etc. Here is a display of a science exploration mission in 3D, revealing the clues of the universe integral sciences the reader is invited to participate in.<br /><br />Dawkins addresses topics that range from his own territory, evolutionary biology and species, to physical phenomena as atomic theory, planetary motion, stellar evolution, spectroscopy, and plate tectonics, as well as speculation on exobiology. Dawkins admits his understanding of quantum mechanics is blurred, declining to search deeply into that topic. Rather than over simplifying subjects, Dawkins's explanations demonstrate that life on earth is magical enough without tricks of the eye or supernatural theories. His argument here takes non traditional form; a book addressed to young readers, and illustrated with great skill by noted artist McKean.<br /><br />Beautifully designed and wonderfully illustrated the book spans knowledge aspects by exploring myriads of questions that matter. The answers take us from hydrogen to hibernation, DNA to the Doppler effect, from tsunami to tectonic shifts, from parallax to perihelion. Like Daniel Boorstin,'The Discoverers', the struggle of man's search to know his world and himself unfolds. Starting with the myths once existed to explain the mysteries of the universe, the seasons, or the shaking earth, and by the conclusion of the book, the Egyptian, Hopi, Greek, Maori, Hebrew and Christian traditions are placed as equally primitive, with lacking explanations of reality.c questions.

B003Z0BSU8|4.0|This review will focus only the Third Concerto as I didn't download the lesser-known Fourth Concerto.  Overall, it is a satisfying interpretation and performance.  Andsnes plays very well, and his approach strikes the perfect balance between mind and heart for me.  His rendition of the cadenza in the first movement (he opts for the long version) is among the most thrilling I've heard.  The LSO also plays alertly under Pappano's baton.  A bit less satisfying is the quality of the recording.  There are a couple of moments where the balance changes noticeably, almost as if my place in the auditorium moves from the front to the rear and back to the front.  The engineers must have been fiddling with the knobs, and it gets annoying after repeated listenings.  If this is important to you as a listener, it may be a dealbreaker.  I also own Andsnes's first recording of this piece (with the Oslo Philharmonic and Paavo Berglund), and I personally prefer his earlier effort to this more recent one.  Interpretively, his approach is very similar, but EMI did a much better job with the first recording.  The levels and balance sound more natural, which is quite an achievement since that recording was from a series of live performances.  If you already own that recording, there's no need to purchase this new one.

B000LTAY1U|4.0|I have had this watch for nearly a year now and have had it in rotation with a few others.  Pros:  -Automatic, no batteries  -It's QUIET especially compared to some Timex watches.  - Great lume, a few minutes under some light will result in hours of illumination. Initially it will be very bright and fade to a soft glow after an hour or so.  - The face is done in a aviator format which makes it very simple and easy to read, especially when teaching a little kid how to read analog.   -Day and date  -Price point is great for an intro level automatic watch.  Cons:  -Water resistance only rated at 30m/100ft great for every day but think twice before wearing it to the beach or with any water sports.  -the crystal is reflective.  -Automatic, the watch will wind down/stop if you don't wear it for a day or two.  -Shake and bake, you cant wind it using the crown.  -There is no power reserve indicator.  Conclusion:  It is a great watch and keeps time well while looking sharp. Most of the cons are things I expect from at a higher price point. I have replaced the stock strap with a nato from Watchband girl. Caution to bigger guys the watch is  on the small side.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Was doubtful when I ordered this item as most of the other hands free car kits I have used were more expensive. I was very surprised that this speakerphone is hands down the best I've used so far. It beats my Motorola, Jabra and LG in sound quality (both incoming and outgoing) and is very easy to set up and use. My other speakerphones all died after only a few months in the Texas heat. So far, so good on this model. Not a bunch of extras on this unit, but I really just wanted a hands free that I could understand the conversation clearly and that I didn't sound like I was talking in a coffee can. This is the unit. If you are looking for a good basic hands free speakerphone with excellent sound quality and ease of use, this is it.

1439192812|5.0|The Magic of Reality pleasantly surprised me; in so far as it covers, in easily readable prose, areas of science I have often found daunting or intractable. To an extent, it offers a kind of FAQ of the universe and man's place in it, from early superstition to the sophistication of modern science.<br /><br />The illustrations greatly enhanced both the clarity and the sense of wonder which is engendered. Myth and magic, perhaps often regarded as in conflict with empirical or experimental science, are revealed as having a deep significance of their own in the development of our early ancestors and inevitably awaken a deeper awareness of our own significance, despite our individuality.<br /><br />No dry academia here. Rather, I think, an author whose fascination with his own life's work is certainly infectious.<br /><br />Raymond Nickford<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005NWRKCQ A Child from the Wishing Well]]
0545259088|3.0|\\"Shiver\\" was a beautiful book. It was well written, had an intriguing plot, and offered a unique take on werewolf mythology that I haven't encountered in other YA novels on the market. I honestly do not know why it was turned into a trilogy. Both \\"Linger\\" and \\"Forever\\" were filled with so much filler that it took the fun out of reading them. I was bored, and YA novels should not be boring. If you feel the need to read \\"Linger\\" and \\"Forever,\\" I highly recommend that you check them out from the library. Though they are extremely well written and offer some valuable insights into Grace's parents' psyches that readers are not privy to in \\"Shiver, they just do not measure up.

B000HEVALC|5.0|Well, I must be the only person alive who never cared for Elvis---but I LOVE this CD!  While in Memphis briefly with some time to kill, I took the tour of the Sun Records Studio, expecting it to be hokey and touristy.  Turns out it was the best $12.00 I ever spent!  I came away from that tour wanting to buy this CD and it is fabulous. Basically a jam session, not a \\"formula\\", \\"produced\\" record.  I usually prefer roots oriented, unplugged and unadorned music of many genres, wanting to hear the musical gifts of the musician shine through (rather than an over-orchestrated, overbearing, boring, predictable mess).  This is the epitome of that purity for those who love boogie-woogie, rockabilly, gospel, and old-timey tunes.  Elvis WAS from the South, after all, despite his flashy Las Vegas persona in later years. It made me want to go out and buy all the Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins, and EARLY Elvis (before he was \\"Flashy Elvis\\") I can find.  Plus, it is quite interesting and educational to hear the banter between the musicians and observe their \\"process\\". A really fun disc.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I don't care much about what others have said. I am not being dismissive. I mean that with so many reviews there is bound to be much good and much (maybe less) not so good. Instead of criticizing others, I'll write my own brief impressions which will get lost in a wilderness of words...<br /><br />It is not easy to express my feelings after having read A Discovery of Witches. I was so enthralled that I felt I was there, being part of the action, trying to help Diana and admiring her, loving Matthew, and all the other characters. The setting is as animated as the characters. All of them are carefully developed, and it is easy to know who they are and to follow the action - and what action! A whirlwind towards the end.<br /><br />I am still reveling in wonderment and joy - a feeling that will not leave me soon. I'll need to read this book again, and wait for the next one. The ending was perfect, and I felt the door closing behind me.  But it will open again some time soon, we hope!
B004XN3FHA|5.0|One word to describe this flashlight...AWESOME!!! I was blown away on how bright this truly is. Word of caution...If you have kids THIS IS NOT A TOY!!! This can seriously hurt your eyes and children should not be able to use it. On another note...I am a bit of a flashlight nut job and have dozens of them floating around the house car, etc...This thing is made to last and I am COMPLETELY SATISFIED! It is worth the money.
B0038M2AZA|4.0|very good movie. Would have like to have seen her more as a child. my grandson, who is 7, has aspergers. Most people do not understand him, but he is very smart and intelligent. His school work does not always show his intelligence, but it is due to him not learning the way we do. This movie was very enlightening. Loved it.
B0054JELS4|4.0|I enjoy NCIS, but my wife and daughter are addicted!  I purchased the complete series as a birthday gift, and I have made them very happy.  They have been able to find episodes that they haven't seen before, even on \\"marathon weekends\\".  By watching some of the earlier episodes, things that happen later in the series make more sense.  In addition, purchasing the DVD set has freed up a lot of space on our DVR, which was previously programmed to record every episode that aired on cable! If you are a dedicated NCIS fan, this set is definitely for you.
B004KAB5QO|4.0|Susan Hill's \\"Woman in Black\\" represents the classic English ghost story; that inimitable tale that conjures up not campfires and guys with hooks for hands, but drafty rooms in country manors on cold nights, snifters of brandy around the dim light of a fireplace's dying embers.  That the theatric version Of \\"WiB\\" has been running for nearly twenty years on London's Drury Lane is a testament to Susan's Hill's ability to create sheer terror through sparse prose and minimal trappings.<br /><br />Theo Parmitter is an ancient Cambridge professor and still the perennial favorite of generations of former students who still compete for a seat next to him at the table wen returning to visit.  \\"Married\\" to the university and its cloistered life, Parmitter's passion is collecting art.  Decades earlier he obtains an unremarkable but strangely alluring painting of a carnival scene in Venice, eventually learning that the painting has a sinister history that promises a dark future for those who come into ins possession.  As Parmitter recounts the story of the painting to a former student, the malevolence of the painting and its violent history are slowly revealed.<br /><br />Unlike the period setting of \\"Woman in Black,\\" \\"The Man in the Picture\\" is contemporary, but follows the same formula: a narrative recounting the seemingly routine events of an earlier time building gradually to horror.  But unlike \\"Woman,\\" \\"Man in the Picture\\" produces a lighter level of fear, more cerebral and less direct; a well-told and well-executed story, but not one that will reverberate in bad dreams or keep the lights on at night.  This is a quick read - not much more than an ambitious short story - that starts strong but suffers from an ending that falls short of an intriguing set up.  Notwithstanding, Susan Hill is a master at her craft, and any fan of old-school, pre-slasher horror fiction will want to keep this one on their short list.
B004LWZW42|4.0|Well lets just say X-Men First Class was a lot better<br />than I expected. I loved the time period it was set in and<br />the characters were wonderful.Not too bad given the short<br />time period they had to work with in doing this movie.<br />As a long time Marvel fan from my childhood which was around 6 or 7<br />years old I became aware of the DC and Marvel universes.This was way<br />back in the mid sixties, thus I had a long time to become a fan.<br />My first X-Men comic was a \\"special giant sized\\" issue<br /> that was 25 cents. Back then comics were 12 cents and later jumped to 15 cents.<br />But I remember it was about the original team taking on Magneto and his so called brotherood of evil mutants- Toad, Mastermind, Quicksilver and The Scarlet Witch.<br />I just wonder why like so many other fans don't they just make a movie<br />like the original story- with Cyclops, Iceman, Beast, Angel, and Jean Grey.<br />Sure I understand the lets mix things up a bit thing but it would be<br />nice to have the original done with XMFC type of style set in the 60's.<br />But I still liked this version and still clamour for every X-Men movie that<br />comes out.For me this is a buy.

B005D51JQQ|2.0|Most acts will price such a box set at roughly half of the price of what Sting is asking for here.  This will severely limit who buy this item, strictly the wealthly/upper end will buy this.  If this was priced more reasonably than the sales would have been lot better for it.
B0052UYJDC|1.0|I am really shocked by all of the fantastic reviews for this book. Really did not like it at all.<br /><br />I thought the author was just not realistic. I was hoping this book would help me declutter and downsize. For example, not having a couch in the living room, no tv, etc. That lifestyle may work for her, but not for a lot of folks. Would have been helpful to have more mainstream ideas.<br /><br />Read a few chapters then deleted it off my Kindle.
B004G600A4|5.0|Tangled is the best Disney Princess movie.  She is cute, funny and brave.  Not the traditional waif princess.  Love Flynn/Eugene and Maximus.  Very Funny.  Ruffians and Thugs are great and the music is wonderful.  My husband and I find ourselves singing the music around the house.
B004MOMT2M|4.0|I bought this for the DVD portion of the album. I haven't even put the CD in a player. The album is one of my all time favorites, which is why I didn't have a problem dropping the cash on it again.   I've always enjoyed the original mix of the album. Overall, it sounds good, but it could have been better. I've always thought the original mix was lacking in absolute detail.  First the bad: The mixing of the album in 5.1 is very inconsistent & intrusive. I was hoping for simply an enhanced version of the album. Instead, The surround speakers constantly call attention to themselves. I don't think it does any justice to the original at all. It sounds like the engineers were more concerned with using the surrounds than with staying true to the original.  Now the good: The stereo track of the album is everything I've ever wanted out of this album. It sounds absolutely fantastic. I can easily pick out every piece of Neil's drum set. The Guitar & Bass sound perfect. I can't think of anything I'd change on this mix. It's flat out amazing & well worth the price of admission. I can highly recommend this disc if you're looking for the perfect stereo copy of the album. If you're looking for the perfect surround mix, however, I'd definitely pass on this one.
0316152196|2.0|First book  by Connelly-he's  no Coban or Patterson and  Lee  Child is his  daddy. Bosch  character  is robotic, unrealistic  not  likeable  and not human. So far 1/2  through the book.  Good story and premise  but slow  moving  Bosch has no real personality Reminds  me of SGT Friday on Dragnet-  just the facts  He's doesnt sleep eat or other human  characterics. Bad  writing. The  book isnt fun. I want to get this read and done with to try  Marshall Karp If this is  one of  Connelly's  best - 4 1/2  stars, geesh I can't imagine the others  Connelly fans:  Move on to Lee  Child.  Even Patterson's  understudy- Andrew  Gross  is far  more compelling in his story telling and  making the  characters rich and likeable  Bosch- Connelly- blehh!!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I'm jumping on the old coot's bandwagon. I will not buy the relevant trilogy on blu-ray until the real originals are available. Lucas' remakes are an abomination. I also think Ep's 1-3 should be re-made by someone who knows something about story telling. I think the common denominator here is that Lucas didn't have full creative control in the making of the originals. The more control he's given, the more he destroys these once great movies. Until the originals are released in high def, I'll keep my Laser Disc editions. There was another person who, like Lucas, tried to change history. His last name was Stalin, & while I'm sure Lucas hasn't killed nearly as many people, he has killed the childhood memories of millions...
0061537969|4.0|I just finished this book. I hemmed and hawed over reading this for a few years and finally downloaded it. I'm not into racing and I don't have a dog, but it was worth it just to get to the end. Great story and plenty of good messages. I won't go through those since other reviewers have told plenty. I'm wondering if they can make this into a movie. I'll be the first one there!
0439023513|5.0|The third book in The Hunger Games trilogy is the best of them all.  It takes a very realistic approach to war, the ravages of war and the aftermath of war.  It places Katniss Everdeen in the awful position of having to recognize that one form of government can be just as bad if not worse than another.  When she realizes that all talking heads have the potential for power hungriness, greed and corruption she is forced to make a split decision that some readers might not understand.  I was sad and disappointed at the amount of central characters who were sacrificed in this last book but, hey, war isn't pretty.  Suzanne Collins took a brave stance in choosing to depict war as it truly is in all its savage and horrific ugliness.  Mockingjay is of course the book of the rebellion and since it is the final chapter in the trilogy it ends on a realistic, disquieting and perhaps sad note.  But fighting changes people.  War not only takes lives but it kills the human spirit.  As Peeta has said: \\"...something is significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its children's lives to settle its differences.\\"  This can be construed as an anti-war message by Ms. Collins but I see it more as her reflecting upon and commenting on war.  There IS something wrong with creatures who offer their children up to be killed over such things as oil, money, territory and religion.  Mockingjay is a sobering book but it makes a wonderful inspirational statement about the human will to live, about survival and hope. To the very end, strong, fearless Katniss remains true to herself.  And that is perhaps the most vital message of all.  To be strong.  To be fearless.  To be true to yourself.  A message all young women need to hear.  I highly recommend The Hunger Games trilogy.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|*In Which Pretty Much Everyone Dies.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Part 1, as in, \\"I can't WAIT to see what happens!\\" I liked Part 2, but it more along the lines of, \\"I'd like to know what happens.\\" By Part 3, I started thinking, \\"I guess I'd better find out what happens.\\"<br /><br />Parts 1 and 2 are intriguing because of the diabolical aspect of the Games. I *know* part of the point of Part 3 is that the whole country is sucked into the same sort of sick \\"game\\", but it was a lot of military positioning, etc... which I had to start skimming over.<br /><br />And I *know* it's supposed to be dark, and tragic, and all, but there were numerous deaths that I felt fairly betrayed by. Which, okay, you're *supposed* to feel that way, because of the horror of the whole war. But c'mon.<br /><br />Pretty Much EVERYONE Dies.
0439023521|4.0|The first book in The Hunger Games trilogy introduces the reader to all of the major players including the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, her best friend, Gale, and her co-conspirator in the Games, Peeta.  Katniss lives in the poverty stricken coal mining District 12 ruled by The Capitol.  When we're first introduced to Katniss she is a tough 16 year old girl who provides food for her mother and little sister, Prim, by escaping to the meadow where she hunts for game with Gale.  Katniss is alarmed by the way Gale talks about The Capitol, fearing they will be overheard.  Speaking against The Capitol is a death sentence.  But Gale is a young man full of rage and fury against the wealthy, privileged residents of The Capitol who live off the 12 outlining districts and he will not be silenced.  When Prim is chosen to be a contestant in the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place setting a chain of events in motion that will forever change The Capitol and all the districts.  The first book is about the Games.  Katniss and Peeta (who was also selected to participate) are prepped, groomed and trained.  We are introduced to each of their prep team's including Cinna.  Haymitch (a former victor) is their mentor but proves a difficult person to work with since he's a raging alcoholic.  When Katniss and Peeta enter the arena they are forced to kill or be killed.  Only one person will be the victor in this violent, deadly game.  This is a great trilogy of books with a strong, fearless young woman as its central figure.  Suzanne Collins has created a heroine and strong literary role model for females.  I highly recommend this book.
B005IU1OMA|4.0|Caveat lector: my favorite snowboarding movie of all time is \\"That's It, That's All\\". While this film, in my opinion, doesn't live up to TITA, it is still a killer film in it's own right. Worth every penny. Cinematography is stellar. Soundtrack is good. Riding is solid. It just didn't quite measure up to Travis and company's last one. But that is an unfair comparison. I doubt any movie will ever be as good as TITA. This is a close second. Travis kills it as usual. And the rest of the crew are no slouch.  If you have never seen \\"That's It, That's All\\", buy this first, prepare to be blown away, and you'll be left wondering, \\"How can any snowboarding film ever top THAT?!\\" Then, go watch TITA, and you'll have your answer.
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire is the 2nd  book in The Hunger Games Triology.  It picks up where the first book left off and continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, Gale, Peeta, Hamitch, and Cinna.  The reader is also introduced to new characters.  I don't want to say too much about the book because I don't want to give anything away.  I will say it is even better than the first book.  Katniss Everdeen is a strong, independent minded, fearless young woman who fights for what she believes in -- literally.  She is skilled at defending herself and is an excellent literary role model for young women.  Like the first book, I highly recommend Catching Fire.

1400052173|4.0|\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" follows and explores three inseparably interconnected stories. The first one is about a personal life of Henrietta Lacks and her family. The second one describes scientific advances in understanding of cancer, search for its cure, and break-throughs made possible because of HeLa cells. And the third one navigates through historical evolution of complex social policies and arguments trying to balance rights of a patient and a need for scientific advances for the betterment of the whole human race.  It's not an easy book to read because the main stories are dramatic and full of personal pain. Still, those are the stories that had to be told, and the way Rebecca Skloot did it was exceptional. The author spent many years creating a connection with a family that had been wronged many times before Rebecca appeared in their life. She also investigated and interviewed many scientists, technicians and policy makers to deliver other sides of the story.  What stood out for me was a part that highlighted a personal hatred of Deborah Lacks towards George Gey. It seemed like she associated him with everything wrong that happened to her mother and her family. At the same time George was depicted as a humble, dedicated and self-sacrificing scientist and inventor who never gained personal benefits from HeLa cells and never did anything explicit to hurt Lacks family. He operated within constrains and rules of his time even though some of those rules are questionable if judged from today's perspective.   No story of such magnitude is ever simple. It's very easy to concoct conspiracy theories and cherry pick events to support them. What's hard is to have an ability to view a given situation through multiple and sometimes conflicting lenses and to preserve objectivity as much as possible. I felt that Rebecca Skloot picked the hard way, and all of us benefited from it.

1596432594|5.0|Read this book! Much has been written about Richard Feynman and he's written much himself but this biography in graphic novel form is unique, informative, spellbinding, entertaining and enlightening. Dr. Feynman is one of the few people on my list of men and women I would liked to have known if only to have spent an afternoon with them sharing a few beers. I really feel that the author and illustrator have captured the essence of Dr. Feynman with their collaboration and I truly believe that Dr. Feynman would have been very, very pleased as well as very amused by the book. If you have any interest at all in Dr. Feynman then you absolutely must read this book. I finished it in one sitting because I simply could not put it down. Congratulations to the author and illustrator in creating something absolutely wonderful. Thank you!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This set is incredible. People who gave this one star has not even seen the movies before they rated. The original trilogy looks outstanding there is no way you could tell this was shot back in 1977, it looks much better than a lot of the blu-rays from recent movies. I must buy for any fan of the series. You will only notice changes if you have no life and are a very petty person. This series is incredible and Lucas deserves more appreciation for the masterpiece he has brought us.
1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is such a unique and beautifully written book.  Unique in not only the pictures but the story line as well and beautiful in the writing style and the photographs that were chosen.  Even though many of the photographs are very creepy and could easily keep me up at night, they were used wisely and fit very well with the story.<br /><br />When I first heard about this book, I wanted to read it right away! But then I went to a Ransom Riggs event where he signed books and told about how he came up with the story, I wanted to start reading it the next day.  One of the main reasons I love going to author events is because I always gain a deeper appreciation for the stories and the characters they have written.  Authors always speak about them with such passion and conviction.<br /><br />I learned from Ransom Riggs that he was originally just collecting old photographs when he realized that he could put them together and create a story.  I especially love how he talked about a particular photo of a girl with her back turned to the camera.  Since it was an old photo, it seems strange that they would pay all that money for her picture to be taken and then just have her back turned.  Instances like that make the photos even creepier!<br /><br />Even the story itself was creepy and I kept wondering if the peculiar children were real or if Jacob's grandfather was just crazy.  I was so happy when he figured out they were real which meant the creature that was hunting them was most likely real and Jacob was not crazy either for seeing it.  I could just go on and on and on about all the elements that are so unique in this book like the time loop, how there are other loops all throughout time hiding other children, the whole aspect of World War II (I'm a history geek!), the keepers of the loops turning into birds and the fact that the children only age mentally and not physically! This book was so crazy; I loved it!  I love books with old houses that creep me out!<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is one of the most unique books that I have ever read with some of the creepiest photographs that I have ever seen! I completely recommend that you read it as soon as you can!s Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is one of the most unique books that I have ever read with some of the creepiest photographs that I have ever seen!

0553801473|3.0|I was addicted to this series, and thought I would never tire of reading new installments. But the last two books have become so dark and brutal that I no longer look forward to returning to the story. There is no denying author Martin's stunning descriptive powers - in particular the detailing of Tyrion's river trip through the eerily fog-bound Sorrows with its massive crumbling palace and ruined statuary looming in the mist. However, there are simply too many sinners in his books and too few saints. In this survival-of-the-fittest civilization (and I use that word loosely) there is far more cruelty than kindness. SOME contrast would be nice. I closed the book before finishing it. I've found Westeros and its world too grim, squalid, desperate, and violent to want to visit again.
B005K2KCPG|3.0|This cd is darker than the first one, the first one was more in the FUN vibe. It's a solid effort by four really great musicians. It's a good old rock record kinds of which are harder to find - because there is only one Sam Hagar, only one Satch, no drummer like Chad Smith and Michael Anthony is the most under-rated bassist and vocalist of the last 30 years. If you want a record to rock your socks off, get BOTH Foot records. They are phenomenal live, too bad Chad won't be there this time, but Kenny is a solid guy!  Buy the record, be your own judge, just don't expect anything revolutionary. It's a great rock and roll record.  thank you Foot for still doing what you do best - make music for our ears!  Lovin the Foot!  Of course everyone out there is holding their breath for a \\"new\\" VH record and that we will see if it is not a rehash of the aborted Roth sessions from the late 90s and we'll see how long the new VH will last...IF the record ever comes out.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|I loved it. They finnally found there grove again.  Some great hard tracks, just helps get those frustrations out.

For all the negative reviews, I never understood that if you are no longer a fan or just don't like the band why you rate the album.

B005M5NDCA|5.0|I bought this early this morning...listened to it right away...it is great!!  I was not sure how it would be, and he was not only as good as he was on American Idol, he is 10X better. It is nice to see that he remains true himself.  No profanity some songs about God and others that are just funny and sweet. He really has an amazing voice.  Way to go Scotty!
0446547603|5.0|This is a book about a woman trying to start her life over, quietly, but as love would have it she cannot.  If you have liked Spark's books before you will love this one as well.  I always have a hard time putting his books down and the same went for this one.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is my favorite among all the keyboards I've used. The one thing that amazes me is when writing in different languages there is no need to select the language needed, SwiftKey X recognizes the language I am using automatically. This feature makes this keyboard stand above the crowd. A must have!
0446585025|5.0|Reading this book is like traveling to some beautiful alternative universe where people are kind, love is everywhere, and life is good. It's more than just a \\"funny\\" book. It's a complete experience of another, nicer and more intelligent way to view the world.  I felt different after I read this book. Smarter. Nicer. Stronger. Happier. The world looked a little bit different. And I felt better about everything. (And I was happy already).  But the book is not only uplifting and empowering. It is hilariously funny! Much funnier than her previous two books. They were light time passers. Good for a chuckle. But Ellen has matured since then. And this book is at a higher level in all departments. I found myself laughing constantly at how clever something was. And I rarely find a book laugh out loud funny. But this one certainly is.   Full of Ellens winning life philosophy...told in the form of funny stories. Some true, some not. There is love. Freedom of thought. Creativity. Inspiration. This book felt like more than a book.   It feels like an experience. An experience not to be missed. Recommended.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|In a nutshell, the story is about a high school chemistry teacher/husband/father who finds out he has terminal cancer. Realizing his family will be burdened beyond belief after his death, he sets out to secure their financial future by cooking and selling crystal meth with what little time he has left. Encountering all the problems one would expect from the situation, he seeks out and employs a former student of his who is a small-time CM dealer/user, all while trying to keep his cancer and newfound \\"hobby\\" a secret from his wife and DEA agent brother-in-law.  The writing is superb. Just further proving that all of the best creative work right now is in 60-minute TV, not films. The acting is fantastic - Bryan Cranston walks away with the Best TV Actor award each year. The show is also far and away above all others in their artistic use of light and camera.  But here's the thing: I've never seen a better \\"save the cat\\" show in my life. It's one thing for a show to place their characters in seemingly impossible situations but it's an entirely different thing to be able to  creatively get the characters out all while maintaining believability. Despite the absolutely absurd situations these characters put themselves in, at no point do you question their motives or their decision making.  Yes, this is what would happen if this person tried to do this. Yes, this is how they would behave.  And it's always nothing short of fascinating.  I originally thought they would take a more absurdist/comedic POV to the story but, to my surprise, they went in the opposite direction. The story goes to some very dark, very real places. There were points in season 2 (I watched seasons 1 & 2 on DVD) when I had to pause the show and walk away from it for 5-10 minutes because it was simply too intense.  Fair warning: as good as the writing and acting are this show probably isn't for the ultra squeamish. How would a high school chemistry teacher dispose of a body? What would such a person realistically have to do to become a major drug player? The creators don't dodge any questions and don't make it easy on the characters.
B005NQ94LM|5.0|the story is about loneliness how loneliness will after us and about love and between what is love and what is lust what we dream and what we want.
0891419063|5.0|My husband, for whom I bought this book is really enjoying it, although he said he wasn't sure at first he could finish it. It pulls no punches on the things that happened there.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Outstanding audio quality. Video is excellent as well.  Although there's a mix of HD and SD videos, it's not a distraction because of masterful editing.  There are too few 3D scenes (I got the 3D enhanced version). Considering the situation and the nature of the source material, it's very well put together.  It is a must have for people who love pop music.
0385344325|5.0|Jack Reacher is dispatched to a small town in Mississippi, Carter Crossing, to support the investigation into the murder of a young woman. The Army has a base, Fort Kelham, just outside of the town. Army soldiers regularly socialize in Carter Crossing, and the town relies on the soldiers to keep its restaurants and bars busy. The base is used for Ranger training, including an elite force which is sometimes dispatched from Kelham for clandestine missions overseas. One of the Rangers is a suspect in the murders; he also happens to be a Captain and the son of a United States Senator, who is the chairman of the Senate's Armed Services Committee.<br /><br />Soon after arriving in Carter Crossing, Reacher hooks up with the local sheriff, an ex-Marine who was in the Provost Marshal's office. In other words, she was a military cop, just like Reacher still is. She is also (naturally) very beautiful, and Reacher is soon involved with her both personally, and professionally, as they try to find a way to work together to solve the murders (it soon becomes clear that more than one have taken place). She doesn't really trust Reacher - she expects him to be working to protect the Army, even if it means that a cover-up is needed. But is the killer really from Fort Kelham? The sheriff is so convinced that she is not really looking elsewhere. And if the killer does turn out to be someone from the base, will Reacher really participate in a cover-up? If you know Reacher then you already know the answer to that question.<br /><br />Reacher embodies a \\"take the law into your own hands\\" approach to dealing with the bad guys. He does what he thinks is right, what he thinks needs to be done, and the heck with the consequences or with any political considerations or anything else that may get in the way. In this case, his career (and perhaps his life) is on the line if he doesn't handle things carefully.<br /><br />This book has less violence and suspense than most Reacher novels but for me it was just as satisfying. There are a couple of scenes where Reacher needs to take care of local thugs in the way that we have seen in other Reacher novels - head butts, planning six moves in advance so that he can take down four, or six, ganging up on him. The thugs in Carter Crossing initially look like a good parallel story to the murder investigation, but not much is done with that sub-plot, which will be a disappointment to readers wanting to see more of the unarmed combat action that Reacher knows so well.<br /><br />For someone new to the Reacher series, it may not be the best book to begin with simply because the majority of the book consists of Reacher's thought process as he evaluates the situation and the various suspects, working through several possible scenarios, finally resulting in how he finally determines who the real killer is (and then what he finally does about it). For those who are already fans of Reacher, I think felt it was highly enjoyable with the proviso that it is not an edge-of-the-seat thriller or nearly as suspenseful as some of the earlier books, and the outcome is not predictable at all.<br /><br />I am a great fan of Lee Child's books. The Affair is the 16th novel in his Jack Reacher series, and I've read them all - in fact, I've gone through the full series twice now. This is my favorite series of books from an active author, and I am one of those folks who has the date of the next release marked on my calendar (unfortunately the frequency seems to be consistent at basically one book per year). There are not very many authors who motivate me to look forward to their next book with as much anticipation as Lee Child, the only other one I can think of is probably John Grisham. Interestingly, both of those authors continue to write their own books, not co-author them as seems to be the trend these days for so many best-selling authors. Coincidence?<br /><br />This is the second book in the series to take place \\"prior\\" to Reacher's retirement from the Army, which is when the majority of the books are set. I would like to see more stories occurring during Reacher's military career; it puts more (and different) constraints on Reacher's ability to act unilaterally and adds an element of military bureaucracy that can add greatly to the story.<br /><br />If you are new to Jack Reacher, here is a complete list of the Reacher novels as they were written.

B0036TGT3E|3.0|I watched the Lion King in 3D recently in the theaters and the film's restoration and upgrade to HD looks magnificent.  Unfortunately the cheap skates at Disney didn't give us a coupon for the blu-ray version, only the 3D version and only 5 bucks off that 30 fisting.  Luckily Best Buy has this Blu ray for 19.99 the release week so go there and get it!
B005BQTUVI|4.0|Guillermo del Toro is one of the most original visionaries still directing and creating films today. His films are usually very attractive visually and put a different spin on something you may already be familiar with while also darkening its tone. Even if you don't fully adore whatever del Toro film you just watched, you can probably find something in there to admire and the experience still turns out to be more interesting than the average popular fluff that people go gaga for. del Toro has also produced some amazing projects with The Orphanage gaining quite a bit of praise and being called one of the most original horror films of the past few years and Splice having one of the most surreal audience reactions I've ever witnessed in the theater just to name a few. Guillermo del Toro's projects aren't necessarily films you've never seen before, but are more along the lines of the films you want to see Hollywood producing. His English language debut, the sci-fi thriller Mimic, has just been released as a director's cut on Blu-ray. After realizing how intense the uphill battle was for del Toro just to get this thing made and fighting tooth and nail just to keep what he could from his original draft(s) of the screenplay, it's really quite incredible the movie turned out as good as it did.<br /><br />The amount of work that went into making something as silly as giant cockroaches become a reality may be the film's biggest achievement. del Toro didn't want a gorefest or give these creatures extra appendages or teeth to make them more menacing. Scientifically speaking, all of the modifications stay within the boundaries of nature. A great deal of research went into creating these monsters and you can tell. The way they mimic humans, where their lungs are placed, and the amount of puppeteering involved are all pulled off in a way where it's obvious a lot of time went into planning how they'd be executed. It's a welcome change of pace worth noting since most horror films along the same lines as this are all about the quick scare and creating a monster that is visually menacing rather than staying within the limitations of reality. del Toro makes it clear in the commentary that Mimic is more about suspense than aiming to be scary. The fact that the film is a slow burn allows you to digest everything a bit more than a film that would throw everything at you all at once.<br /><br />The special effects look very dated, but only when it comes to digital stuff. Thankfully, it's kept to a minimum because of the budget but all of the practical stuff is fantastic. Seeing their mouths move just like a cockroach's is such a simple idea, but seeing it executed in a creature as big as we are is something extraordinary. The concept of them using their front appendages to form a human face is really creative and exceptional, as well. The method in which this team has pulled off adding human traits to a cockroach without it feeling too far-fetched is spectacular in itself.<br /><br />Unfortunately I never saw the theatrical cut of the film so I can't really compare the differences, but del Toro's explanations of it don't really make you want to actively hunt it down and see it since this is obviously the cut of the film he wants people to see. The last thing that should be touched upon is the lighting (or lack thereof) used in the film. Most of the camera work in the film seems very straightforward, but having a dolly sliding to the right while another slides to the left makes something as simple as the camera circling around two characters seem a bit more extravagant. An emphatic use of shadows, textures, and amber and blue lighting is used throughout the film to give it a look that many other genre films don't have. Everything just feels very unique and like something you'd only find in a film by del Toro.<br /><br />Mimic isn't del Toro's greatest achievement, but all of the elements you love about the Mexican director are all there. The attention to detail is astounding as del Toro's scientific approach and staying true to nature made giant cockroaches as realistic as possible. Mimic is also visually remarkable in the way it not only uses shadows, but a minimal use of lighting and heavy textures as well. The only real complaints lie within the dated CG and the fairly atrocious ending. Its obvious flaws and production troubles aside, Mimic is more intelligent than you're probably expecting and a very solid experience overall.<br /><br />The special features are pretty cool. Video Prologue with Director Guillermo del Toro is only about a minute long but del Toro talks about how this is as close to a director's cut as we'll ever get, being happy with this cut, what the movie could have been, and so on. The Audio Commentary with Director/Cowriter Guillermo del Toro is the Blu-ray's crowning achievement. del Toro is so open about everything that happened behind the scenes, but doesn't seem bitter about any of it. He's very straightforward and isn't afraid to use harsh language, but the entire commentary just makes you admire the film and the rest of del Toro's work just a little bit more. He seems so easy to get along with and relate to. During the commentary, many topics are covered including the opening credits being similar to Se7en, Mimic teaching del Toro more than some of his other films have, the cockroaches originally being bark beetles/scarabs, the never-ending studio battles, original ending idea involving the male cockroach in the subway, the film originally being planned to have no explosions, and he even talks about the direct to video sequels among many other things (he actually recommends seeing Mimic 3). del Toro refers to Mimic as his \\"imperfect child.\\" One of my favorite lines from the commentary is when del Toro is talking about Sarah having her Ripley moment as she yells at the male cockroach to get away from Chuy. del Toro says, \\"You cringe every time, I cringe every time, let's cringe together.\\" The commentary track just helps you admire the film a little bit more and that's coming from a guy who isn't a big fan of commentary.<br /><br />The rest of the special features are fairly short and sweet. Reclaiming Mimic is about fourteen minutes long. del Toro discusses how important suspense is for a film like Mimic, a B-movie concept needing to be executed as an A-movie, the different subway ending, and this director's cut being free of \\"second unit crap.\\" A Leap in Evolution runs around nine and a half minutes and mostly goes into detail about staying true to nature and puppeteering. Back into the Tunnels is a five minute behind the scenes featurette, there are three Deleted Scenes that total around five minutes in length and include an alternate ending, Storyboard Animatics cover six scenes in the film, and a two minute Gag Reel rounds up the special features rather nicely. The second disc of the two-disc set is just a digital copy of the film presented in widescreen in 1080p High Definition and English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.<br /><br />Mimic (The Director's Cut) is unrated, but was previously released in a version Rated R for Terror/Violence and Language. This unrated version contains material different from the original R-rated version. It's presented in 16x9 widescreen with a 1.85:1 ratio while also being presented in 1080p High Definition, has an English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, and has English and Spanish subtitles available.

0553801473|5.0|I like this book and the series in general.  I'm not quite to the end, but have enjoyed it so far...  The only complaint I have is that it is maybe a bit repetitive on a few points (e.g., \\"donning the floppy ears\\"...)
B0059IVVZ6|5.0|This has rapidly turned into one of, if not my favourite album of the year so far.  It is a special, special piece of work that is uplifting and thoughtful, tuneful and captivating.  I first heard this in Rough Trade East in London and it stopped me in my tracks.  Its pace and control are beautiful, a magic collection of songs that deserve listen after proper listen.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Michael Lewis is a writer with a niche. He is the master of turning complex mathematics and market forces into a great story. This is true of the Big Short and it is also true of Moneyball. On the strength of these two books I am looking forward to picking The Blindside. Moneyball illustrates the rise of the baseball stats fan and sabermetrics as well as their integration and adoption by actual baseball professionals after years of being ignored. It follows the first team to use sabermetrics to such a successful extent the Oakland A's who did it not out of good will or scientific inquiry it was because they needed someway to over come the massive disparities in budgets between them and teams like the Yankees and Red Sox. Lewis infuses this narrative with life and humor and a jaunty pace that makes it accessible to every reader. A must read.
B0011UF792|5.0|This is the first Kevin Smith movie I saw. I know I know, I started a little late, but I went back and saw them all to catch up. It's nice to see that after all these years, the movie still holds up. You throw in HD and tons of extras, like delete scenes about love making of biblical proportions, and you got yourself an awesome Blu-Ray.
B00005JKGK|1.0|I just saw this film last night and I was appalled by the rampant and overt racism throughout the film. Unfortunately, the film can be summed up as a 2 hour+ bash against Asian men. Here are a few examples. First, in the novel, the husband who split all expenses with his Asian wife and eventually gets divorced was Caucasian. In the film, he is Asian. Also, the Caucasian husband who cheats on his Asian wife gets divorced in the novel. In the film, they reconcile and live happily ever after. And this is after he cheated on her..wow. Also, in the novel, it makes it clear that the husband only married her in order to spite his mother. In the film, it portrays him as a savior and knight in shining armor. The director himself admitted that he was pressured by the studio to portray certain themes that he was uncomfortable with. No kidding. Pretty much all the good guys are portrayed as Caucasian men while all the bad guys are portrayed as Asian men, seriously! This is a terrible film and deserves two thumbs down and if I could I would give it zero stars.
0385534639|1.0|I tried to enjoy this book. I really did. It came highly recommended, in a signed, special edition complete with a bag of gourmet popcorn. By page 50, I was grinding my teeth, and trying not to skim ahead. By 75, I had gone back through my \\"special edition\\" with an editing pencil. By the 150 mark, I was torn between throwing it out the window, or finishing it in order to write an honest review. Honestly, I've read over 5,000 books in my life, and some of them were bad, and some of them were simply just not to my taste, but this one fell into to the rare category of \\"So-Bad-I'm-Angry\\". The category that prompts even rarer customer reviews as warning.  There is nothing magical about this book. At best, it was like a remake of an 80's pop ballad--with new, shiny bits added in to distract you from the fact that you didn't really need to hear it again, ever. At worst... well, I'd return it if it I could. I haven't felt this way since someone gave me an early Dan Brown book. That one went out the window.   The writing is extremely sloppy, contrived, and dead flat when it isn't dripping with 12-year-old pretension. The characters are completely static and interchangeable, and the magical environment they inhabit has all of the charm of a cereal box. I don't even want to talk about the author's choice of tense and perspective. Or the editor's complete disregard for, say, the entire novel. Other reviewers have pointed out that it might make an interesting film when the rights are inevitably sold. Anything that can breathe the life of a circus, or of love, or of story telling into this ostentatious bore of a book would make it better. A commercial? A puppet show? Anything.

B005DI65L2|4.0|Reading some of the reviews reminded me of how individual each person -- and each dog -- is.  I found the book useful in heightening my awareness of how my dog's physiology affects his interactions with the world. I found the information on vision/movement especially useful. Plus, solely for prompting me to give him more sniffing time on walks, I suspect my dog would say it was well worth the time I spent reading it.  And that's what the reviews seem to boil down to -- whether the reader connected with the book based on whether it reflected that individual's experiences with his/her dog(s). Except for a few reviews that stated dogmatically (pun intended) that the author got things \\"wrong\\" ... the reviewer presumably having gotten that information directly from the dog's mouth ;-)  For this individual, and this individual's individual dog, it was a useful and enjoyable read.

1609611543|5.0|This book, whose author is a preventive cardiologist, puts another big building block in the wall begun by iconoclasts like Dr Robert Atkins and Dr John Yudkin, and thoroughly cemented by science journalist Gary Taubes. Beginning in the late 1960s, Atkins proposed that eating carbohydrates was the main reason for many people's obesity. (Actually, this had been common knowledge since the 1860s if not before - how many of us recall our mothers saying, \\"If you want to lose weight, avoid starchy foods like bread and potatoes\\"?). His 1972 book [[ASIN:1590770021 Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution, Revised Edition]] urged cutting down on sugars, grain-based foods, and even high-carb fruit and vegetables. Despite arousing immense controversy, Dr Atkins' diet seems to have an impressive track record with tens of thousands of patients reporting weight loss and better health. Coincidentally, 1972 also saw the publication of Dr John Yudkin's blast against sugar, [[ASIN:0670808199 Pure, White and Deadly: The new facts about the sugar you eat as a cause of heart disease, diabetes and other killers in this completely revised and updated edition]]. Like Atkins, Yudkin was pooh-poohed and slandered by many who disliked his conclusions. From the 1970s to the present day, medical and government orthodoxy has held that fat - in the form of cholesterol - is the arch-demon of nutrition, and advocated increased consumption of \\"healthy whole grains\\". More recently Taubes filled in the picture in his brilliant survey of scientific developments in nutrition and diet, [[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health (Vintage)]].<br /><br />Although their messages have been frantically (and often viciously) resisted by the nutritional establishment, pioneers like Atkins, Yudkin and Taubes made it clear that most people today (especially in the \\"West\\") eat far too much refined carbohydrate and not nearly enough protein, fat, and good old-fashioned vegetables. Nevertheless it seemed more a matter of degree than a point of principle: sure, we ought to eat fewer potato chips, less white bread, sugar, cakes, puddings and so on. But surely \\"a little of what you fancy does you good\\"?<br /><br />Dr Davis stamps heavily on such notions. Perhaps for the very first time, this book reaches everyone in our civilisation with the message that wheat itself is actually bad for you. Think of that: the staff of life, a word synonymous with food since the Old Testament, stigmatised as a poison! For many years we have noticed ripples of disquiet about wheat: more and more people diagnosed with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome... but most of us shrugged that off, sympathising with the unfortunate sufferers while blithely assuming that something as pleasant, familiar, and natural as bread couldn't possible hurt us \\"normal people\\". Turns out it ain't so. For a start, as Dr Davis convincingly demonstrates, today's \\"wheat\\" is NOT the wheat that the Babylonians, Egyptians, ancient Jews and Greeks, Romans, Saxons, Normans, and even our own grandparents ate. The \\"Green Revolution\\" of 1943 to the 1970s and later replaced traditional wheat with a stunted, bulging, super-productive dwarf variety (it has to have very short stems to support its massive payload of grain without crumpling). This was achieved by moving around a few genes, and everyone assumed there could be no harmful side effects. But in fact, the genetic changes triggered a shift in the range of proteins our wheat contains, with so far unknown effects on health. Moreover, wheat contains gluten (80% of its relatively small protein complement) which can cause a whole raft of hideous diseases - even in those who don't present with symptoms of celiac disease or gluten intolerance.<br /><br />Then there is the little matter of glycemic index (GI): two slices of \\"healthy\\" wholewheat bread raise blood sugar farther and faster than two tablespoonfuls of sugar. That's true of anything with wheat in it. Thus good ol' wheat turns out to be heavily implicated in the worldwide pandemic of obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Not even bothering to trample on the long-discredited belief that cholesterol causes obesity, heart disease, and cancer, Dr Davis demonstrates that wheat is a far more likely culprit in all of those conditions. Fans of the gifted and rigorous blogger Denise Minger will be pleased to see that Dr Davis reproduces four graphs from her blog, in which she shows that Dr T. Colin Campbell drew incorrect conclusions from his own data in [[ASIN:1932100660 The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health]].<br /><br />Another problem with wheat is that it is literally compulsive. Due to exorphins (morphine-like substances similar to the endorphins the body itself produces in response to positive stimuli such as exercise), we are doomed to crave carbs on a two-hourly cycle - which is how long it takes for them to lift our blood sugar to the skies (thus causing insulin resistance) and then dump it in the cellar. Check it for yourself: have a nice feast of wheat-based products, then time how long it takes for you to be ravenously hungry again. Dr Davis claims that those who have kicked the wheat habit can fast, effortlessly, for anything from 18 to 72 hours. They eat because they need to, not because they are addicted to the rewards of wheat.<br /><br />Obviously a book like this raises important questions of public policy. If wheat should be rejected as unhealthy, what are the world's billions to live on? We exceeded the population level that could be sustained without wheat decades ago. So does that mean the poor must accept obesity, diabetes, and a shorter lifespan as the inevitable price of survival? Even in relatively wealthy Western countries, a diet such as Dr Davis recommends will be far more expensive than most of us are used to. The author acknowledges such ethical questions, but does not attempt to tackle them. His task, to alert us to the harm that wheat can do, has been thoroughly accomplished. It is for others to pursue the implications.anything with wheat in it.

0671510991|4.0|I first read this when it came out and have just reread it again. I had forgotten just how good this book is. The first thing that leaps out about the hardback edition is how well the book is produced. Not the cheap, shoddy and poorly edited books of today. It's good quality paper and binding. No spelling errors (unlike books today) and the text is crisp and sharp. I would like to have seen more illustrations however.   Kissinger writes very well and pulls together his historical analogies and comparisons very effectively. Some chapters should be required reading in schools, such as chapters 7 - 10.   In many respects this is Kissinger's best book because he does not inject himself (and his ego) into the subject but instead acts as the worldly and experienced university professor he is.

Highly recommended for anyone who has an interest in pursuing research or patients and families of people afflicted with cancer. Demystifies this deadly and fearful illness.

Not because I didn't have time, but because I just could not get that interested, or get that feeling of, I can't wait to get back to my book!  I felt at times it just could not get more monotinous.  I enjoyed the story line, but if you changed a few details it was exactly a movie I saw with Hugh Grant 15 years ago, no exaggeration.  Slow to start, it picked up in interest towards center, and then gives you a total hollywood ending.  It is an ok book.

B00169N0BK|5.0|I have several photo printers that I use to make photos for my professional photography business.  Due to the cost of printing, I decided to try a generic refillable inking system for one of my Epsons.  The colors from the generic ink are fantastic, vibrant, and lustrous - just like the Epson inks. The problem is that they are darker.  Not in a linear fashion either.  I have tried everything from curves, levels, shadow ramp up - profiles from Epson just do not produce usable output.  There is always black crush and nothing I can do about it.  So I rarely have used that printer for photos, considering it useful only for unimportant, non-color-critical projects.  Enter the Colormunki package.  I decided to give this device a try and what do you know.  After analyzing two sample sheets and hitting print the output from my Epson using generic inks matches that of my screen and my other printers!  The printer is back from the dead!<br /><br />I have used several devices over the years for monitor calibration and my experience is that with a little work you can always get acceptable results with careful measurement.  It is printer profiling that I have been missing out and this device did a great job for me.  You can also go back and use test images to generate more patch sheets to further refine the accuracy of your profiles too.  For the price this kit is a real gem.<br /><br />That's not to say there aren't annoyances though.  As noted you must leave the software running until you scan the second patch sheet.  If you quit you have to re-measure the first and print the second again.  This is a bummer if your colors take more than a few hours to stabilize which is quite common on some inkjets.  Obviously this was done in the interest of preventing owners from charging for remote profiling services using this device.  The limitation on activations that ws mentioned in some other reviews is no longer a concern.  You can activate on as many computers as you like now as long as the device is present.<br /><br />If you're like me and need reasonable color output from your setup and you haven't been getting it this kit is well worth the money.  It uses a spectrophotometer instead of a cheaper colorimeter and the results are just stunning.esent.

B004EPZ00W|5.0|A debatable short list of those who have really in a substantial way changed the face of baseball. With the help of Bill James, baseball statistician guru, Beane, general manager of the Oakland Athletics, devised a new way of breaking down thru statistics those  hidden gem baseball players missed by other teams. Also, Oakland, being one of the poorer teams in the major leagues, moved to jettison high priced under achievers. I'm not a real big fan of this type of \\"new\\" tech style which seems to among many other things, advocate waiting out pitchers for walks. This movie did not lessen my love of the game. It would take more space than this review to explain what has become known as \\"Billy Ball\\". The Boston Red Sox used it to win a World Series in 2004. As for the movie itself, I now like Brad Pitt as Billy at bit more. Jonah Hill has finally graduated to a grown-up role as Peter Brand, Billy's invaluable advisor. Billy, had to, given the economics of baseball operate on a shoestring budget. He was ridiculed by all the old advisors, scouts & even the manager. He stood his ground & the staff meetings with these old geezers are some of the best scenes in this movie. One of the better baseball movies in many years, maybe since \\"Bull Durham\\". Then of course, there is always Brad Pitt.

B000F7CMRW|5.0|I was dissuaded from reviewing this film for years because a very large amazon jury had already reached its verdict. But continuing to bite my lip is difficult, because Syriana's message is as timely and important in 2011, perhaps more so, as when it was released in 2005.  And because, contrary to the many criticisms, Syriana is a patently amazing film--engaging, insightful, and passionate.  It offers a brilliant snapshot of the complexities of politics and energy, and the fallout from them, that fill our headlines everyday and challenge our security.  Many reviewers say, principally, that the story is unclear and confusing.  Let me suggest another view.  Most of the story's subjects are difficult to understand in the U.S. and elsewhere in the west where there is a predominant belief system that impedes understanding--a belief system about the way America acts in the world, about the motives of far-away people in far-away lands, and about the consequences of American actions for those far-away lives as well as for our own.  The amazon reviewer is spot on when he asks if viewers have the courage to watch this film. It takes courage to let go of long-held preconceptions.  Films like Syriana are far and few between that ask viewers, even if only momentarily, to relinquish portions of their belief system.  Those films are courageous, just as are viewers ready for the journey.   What is so beautiful about Syrian is that, for the viewer ready for an intellectual reckoning, the film handsomely rewards.  Long-frustrating puzzles are solved, and long-standing obfuscations are shattered into simple truths about decency and profligacy, about provocation and retribution.  This difficult transformative experience complete, Syriana becomes clear:  There is a partnership between oil and government which has consequences for both Americans and those living in oil-producing countries.  Especially in the Middle East, the consequences involve the persistence of autocratic government.Persistent illegitimate government has consequences on the attitudes of simple and ordinary people who live unhappily under an oppressive system.  Over time, among these people and their supporters in the diaspora, there is an inevitable transformation from attitudes of resignation and acceptance of the status quo to defiance and then militancy against regional sovereigns and their western and US backers.  Syriana's main thesis is one of devastating consequence.  The current Middle East political and economic status quo is unsustainable when too many people believe they have no stake in it.  War, foreign meddling, corruption, and oppressive governments produce humiliation, wide-spread anti-Americanism/anti-Westernism, and finally violence--in the region, here in the U.S., and globally.  Syriana, far from going \\"everywhere and nowhere,\\" goes somewhere most assuredly.  It bravely tells its drama coherently and logically, if not linearly.  Ambitious is not a strong enough word to describe writer/director Stephen Gaghan's effort to tie his thesis and multiple story-lines together into a cohesive and themed story for our times that also happens to entertain, delivering action and punch.  All the more astonishing that he wrote his screenplay by the age of 30 and then went on to direct a stellar ensemble cast. The story may be complex, but, rest assured, it can be unraveled, and it has consequences for all of us here and now.  Some may not be ready to hear Syriana's sobering message, but be courageous enough to consider the possibilities.

1400032717|2.0|Stories like this don't come along too often.  This is a good thing, as I'm always looking for something different, but it's also a bad thing, because the author isn't fully knowledgeable of the subject matter.<br /><br />'The Curious Incident' is about Christopher Boone, a young man with autism and whose point of view this story is told from.  The story begins with a neighbour's dog being killed and this book is supposed to be the one Christopher wrote after coming across the body and trying to figure out who murdered the poor canine.  As an avid reader of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, this is also Christopher's homage to murder mysteries.  In actuality, though, it's a story of how this boy connects (or doesn't) to the people around him and about his family life.<br /><br />As you can see, this is a very interesting tale and one which must be handled with care and precision.  To put it frankly, I was surprised that the actual author, Mark Haddon, was allegedly experienced in dealing with kids/adolescents with autism.  It merely seemed as someone who looked up some information here and there but had no hands-on experience or even spent any time with ANYONE with autism.<br /><br />Hence the 'one big problem' I found with the book.  Actually, there's also a problem within that one big problem -- is Christopher an Aspie, or is he full-blown autistic?  Some paperbacks have a cover which say he is the former, however the author disagreed with this and wanted it removed...to which I would have to then assume he thinks his character does not have a high-functioning form of autism, and then I would have to shake my head even more.<br /><br />Obviously, there is an autism spectrum and there are many different cases of autism and many different variations, but there were times when I kept thinking that Christopher seemed to display severe sociopathic tendencies and a horrible case of OCD rather than having any type of autism, which is not what anyone should be thinking when reading this book.<br /><br />The way Christopher is portrayed goes two ways.  The first -- he has many traits which aren't easily related to autism, especially if not a case of high-functioning autism.  The second -- he has many traits which are too stereotypical to take seriously.  Oh, look!  He's some sort of idiot savant!  All autistic people are prodigal geniuses, right? ...<br /><br />While I commend what the author was attempting to do here, it's unfortunately not well-researched and therefore, if you have had a lot of interaction with Aspies or others with autism, you'll find this book has nothing to offer.<br /><br />Did this book 'open your eyes' to the world of autism?  No, I'd say your eyes are still at half-mast.<br /><br />**/*****he way Christopher is portrayed goes two ways.

0312323867|5.0|This book was really a lot more fun than the first one. It really completed the story. It fixed all of my unresolved feelings from the first book. It really was best moving to Darcy and watching how she gets herself of the jam she's gotten herself into; especially when she realizes that her baby's father isn't who she thought and she should never have thought he was a better choice than Dex. It's also funny to remember that there are people who really believe that mapping out a plan that includes meeting a rich guy and letting him fix everything will still work.
B005G4TJUC|1.0|I'm glad I rented this one first, because image quality was horrible. I popped the disc in my PC to take a look, and discovered the movie was only 2.8GB. What was Paramount thinking? A DVD can hold 8+ GB. The more space that's used, the higher the bitrate. A low bitrate results in poor image quality. So, what we get is a DVD that's nearly empty, and a highly compressed mess of a movie. Thanks for nothing, Hollywood.

B005R32L66|3.0|Skype did work for me on my phone (Samsung Infuse 4G) but, it can be slow and there can be delays in voice and in IMs (haven't bothered trying video since there are too many issues with voice and texting). Works fine on a wifi network but over cell network it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. One big issue with Skype is when you close it after you are done is stays running as a service. Even if you kill it off with something like OS Monitor it will keep coming back to life and it will keep using battery and cell network data. Very annoying and very bad. Only way to permanently kill it off is to shut down the phone and restart, if you have Startup Manager, otherwise it will start up as a background service again automatically. This fact is so annoying I'm undecided as to whether I should keep Skype on my phone or uninstall it. Skype, if you are reading this then please fix the app to not run in the background as a service. I would use it a lot more if it would actually quit after use. Anyway, useful if you really need it, otherwise use something else like Google voice if you can. Skype for droid is not ready for prime time.

B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty Mccreery had announced that the songs on his debut album would make us dance and make us cry.  And the songs on the album do just that.  He has the kind of voice that makes any song sound good, and usually after a few notes I AM either dancing or crying.  But what makes this album special is that not only does that voice get to me, as usual, but also the songs are beautiful, simple and moving.  There is not one song I would remove from this album, from my favorite, Clear As Day, to my, well, next favorite, Better Than That, moving to my NEXT favorite, Write My Number On Your Hand.  This is a refreshing change from a lot of country today which is starting to sound all alike.  There's a little bit of traditional, a little bit of Elvis, and a LOT of Scotty, who shows us all what a real country singer should sound like.  Buy it quick before it's all sold out.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|If \\"Psycho\\" is the granddad of the slasher genre, then \\"Halloween\\" is the father. Sure you had before it, \\"Last House on the Left\\" (terrible movie) & by the same director, Wes Craven, \\"the Hills Have Eyes,\\" great movie! You had \\"the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\\" another great film, but these films all involved families, or more than one in individual as the killers, not so with \\"Psycho,\\" & not so with \\"Halloween.\\" In these films, you had one character, who became an Icon to the horror genre, Norman Bates & Michael Meyers.<br /><br />\\"Halloween\\" does not depend on gore & cheap thrills to scare it's audience, but rather dread & suspense, & \\"the Shape,\\" Michael Meyers, who seems to blend in & out of the shadows. Who is there in broad daylight one moment, & gone the next. What makes it more potent, is that we know nothing about him, other than Dr. Loomis's raving that he is pure evil. Meyers does not have a word of dialog in the movie, which also adds to the dread. He is a silent, anonymous, killing machine, with no rhyme or reason, our worse nightmare!<br /><br />Though this is not my favorite John Carpenter film (The Thing), Carpenter is at the top of his game here, he knows how to scare you, not with hit you over the head scenes, but quietly disturbing scenes. Such a scene is where Annie screams at Myers driving the station wagon, \\"Hey jerk! Speed kills!\\" Meyers comes to a squealing halt a 100 feet away & just sits in the car a minute, then takes off. It's those kind of scenes that make this film what it is, quite dread. Carpenter also wrote the soundtrack, which greatly enhances this movies scare factor, though he lifted the piano part from, \\"Wait Until Dark,\\" with Audrey Hepburn, the soundtrack is a true classic of the genre, & this film would be less potent with out it.<br /><br />I have to admit, after 33 years of seeing this film, it has lost some of it's appeal to me, but when in the mood, it's still a terrific psychological horror film, that deserves all the years of kudos it has received!<br /><br />5 stars = Masterpiecestars = Masterpiece
1400052181|5.0|Insightful how one person's life \\"Henrietta Lacks\\" impacted so many lives.  Mind boggling how a personal event lead to such discovery. Reemphasizes the importance of medical research, but opens the mind to explore how do we make it right for the individual?  Would these trials have taken place in any other period?  Would the results have been the same?  Is the family owed a clearer explanation and financial restitution? What is the right thing to do?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Prim, Johanna, Kinnick, Haymitch, Cinna, and especially Rue are all characters that I will not be forgetting anytime soon. The author does an amazing job at creating these characters and then placing them in you. I loved the detailed description of the world that this story is placed in. No it isn't all happiness and butterflies, but it was their home.<br /><br />You will find yourself being pulled in all kinds of directions and never really knowing the next twist in the tale. I am glad I got the trilogy because I don't know how I would have handled having to wait for the next book in this series to come out. They are awesome. I wanted to give it 4 ½ stars, and my only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I was a little put off by the ending. To say that they were shells of their former selves is an understatement, and I felt that after all that fighting they didn't accomplish much for themselves personally. However, they sacrificed all for the future and others who couldn't fight. You will be happy, sad, and angry. You will laugh, have anxiety attacks, and do a lot of crying you wouldn't think you'd do for a book. But in the end, no matter if you loved the ending or not, you will be happy you read it.
B003Y5H574|4.0|This movie was a slow start, and I found myself wondering, \\"Oh, God, what if all the best parts were in the previews?\\" I hate it when that happens. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the twist at the end. There was more than enough comedy (after the first 30 minutes) to get me through the film. Will I watch this again? Definitely. Favorite movie of all time? Not necessarily. There were some \\"really?\\" moments, and you'll know them when you see them. A good laugh out loud movie. Very nice.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I'm actually knee deep in reading this classic novel right now, so when I received this current adaptation from Netflix the other night I was really excited.  I was hesitant to watch it only because I didn't want my reading pleasure spoiled and yet it was a catch 22 since I either spoil the read or the movie, and since nothings really ever spoiled my read before (I always say, if you want the emotional impact secured, you better see the movie first since the visual swells often outweigh those provided on the written page) I decided to indulge in this lush masterpiece.<br /><br />First of all, this is not `yet another Jane Austen film'.  It's not even written by Jane Austen (it was adapted from the novel written by Charlotte Bronte), even though I can certainly see the comparisons made.  `Jane Eyre' carries with it that thick period drama that Austen was so heavily praised for.  Despite that similarity, there is something darker at play here.  Bronte's prose plays with tonal shifts that Austen would never have entertained.  Where Austen often came off rather light and frothy, even in the midst of tragedy (despite the emotional upheavals in stories like `Sense and Sensibility', the air is almost always crisp with pleasantries), Bronte delves deeper into the haunting quality surrounding life and love found within it.<br /><br />This is most certainly a love story, but one that grounds itself in a darker corner of the human heart.<br /><br />`Jane Eyre' tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated by her aunt and cousin after she is left in her care when her parents die, and then soon thereafter her uncle.  Her aunt is a devil of a woman, unkind and loathsome.  She considers Jane a burden and when she finds an opportunity to unload her on someone else (in this case, a boarding school) she takes it.  Jane is mistreated yet again in the school, but she manages to keep her wits and gain an education that leads to her becoming the governess for the young child of a Mr. Rochester.  In a lavish home, secluded with a precocious child, a kindhearted housekeeper and a brooding beast of a man, Jane begins to find her footing as Rochester's infatuation with her grows into a love she never expected by cannot deny.<br /><br />And then she uncovers his deep dark secret.<br /><br />I just want to take a second to laud the directorial magnificence achieved by Cary Joji Fukunaga.  The breath found in each frame is exhilarating.  He manages to find such emotional depth in the mere framing of his scenes, and that cinematography is outstanding (this film is BEAUTIFUL).  Fukunaga works wonders with his actors here as well.  Dench is so sublime when she plays, well, Dench, and she is perfectly Dench-like in this plum role for her.  Mia Wasikowska is breaking out in some big ways lately, and I'm excited for where her career is going to go.  She is wonderfully reserved and internalized here; carrying with her this stare that says so much more than she wishes it to.  Some have called her wooden (and in the case of that dreadful `Alice in Wonderland' movie, I agree), but her take on Eyre is fantastic, and I'll never forget my adoration of her performance in `The Kids Are All Right'.  The real star here though, is Michael Fassbender.  I have become obsessed with him.  The man is genius.  He just slips into character flawlessly, and his range is undeniable.  As Rochester he is equal parts grotesque and endearing.  He balances out his characters agitated demeanor with this sly arrogance that is oddly charming.<br /><br />His bleeding frustrations are heartbreakingly sincere; and that final scene...<br /><br />UGH...<br /><br />`Jane Eyre' was an unexpected triumph, a film I was anxious to see by weary about the taste level.  There are so many period dramas that wind up being tasteless soap operas that it's really nice to see a film that brings so much `class' to a `classic'.e, secluded with a precocious child, a kindhearted housekeeper and a brooding beast of a man, Jane begins to find her footing as Rochester's infatuation with her grows into a love she never expected by cannot deny.

0375850864|1.0|I just reread this book again, having read it for the first time right after it won the Newbery. I was even more disappointed than the first time I read it. The plot was confusing and a lot of the revelations seemed convenient. But I think the worst part is that the author gave us three wonderful, original characters - the mother, the daughter and the boyfriend and then offered us plot snippets instead of a full-realized plot. Even the ending - which was satisfying in a way - but unsatisfying, too, as it offered us a hint as to what might have been if the author had enlarged the plot concerning the three aforementioned characters. Why all the crazy plot threads about the laughing man, Marcus punching Sal, the time travel, Annemarie and her epilepsy, Julia and her trips, Jimmy the deli man?? There was so much here to blend into a satisfying story and sadly it did not happen.

0553381695|2.0|I can see from most of the other 1 & 2 star reviews, that I am not the first to report that \\"the Emperor is not wearing any clothes!\\". I should have been alerted when I read the \\"blurb\\" about the author on the inside back-cover: \\"...has worked on..blah-blah...and various feature films and pilots that were never made.\\" At the very least, the Greek sailor's cap should have sent up red flags. I started reading this book in conjunction with the HBO series. I soon discovered that the series did a fine job of culling Mr. Martin's propensity for droning on for page after page about some minor detail or character. I should have stopped reading then and there. But no-o-o-o! I wanted to experience this \\"magical new world\\", supposedly being created out of whole cloth. It was not to be. The author's idea of originality is to spell words with one letter changed..Ser?-really?..or use some childish name/description for a person or object...\\"lordlings\\"?...\\"her littleclothes\\"? \\"Sellsword? Or even worse, \\"Sellsailor\\"?..\\"destrier?\\"..ad nauseum. Obviously written to cash in on the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" crowd of \\"neck-beards\\" and Comic-Con costume-wearing fan-boys/ girls. \\"A Clash of Kings\\"? How about a \\"A Kvetch of Kings\\"? I finally collapsed half-way through this exercise in tedium. Cliched, and sometimes irritating characters-Catelyn, the leading example- drone on and on and on; the Black Watch stumbles around outside the Wall; Sansa fritters and twitters around the palace as Joffrey's punching bag; Even Tyrion starts to wear on you as he sets up yet another \\"web of intrigue\\". I think I'll re-read \\"Raptor\\" by Gary Jennings.

Easy way to make sure my battery lasts the day and then some, when gaming won't be an issue.   Enter R-Type. This is the first game I have given the honor of having its shortcut not only on a homescreen but the main homescreen.   This game is quite possibly everything I need for a quick distraction and adrenaline shot. It plays great and it sounds great. The controls can be a bit difficult but I find utilizing the auto-fire and the finger control far preferable to the standard d-pad and constantly tapping to fire.

0470932139|3.0|This book contains way too many technical inaccuracies.   About half the book addresses technical issues (basics, camera modes, natural light, artificial light, post-processing [unread]), it is a shame that these chapters are riddled with so many mistakes, some minor and some huge. And when there are no mistakes, technicals aspects are sometimes poorly explained. Begginners reading this book will be confused, more advanced photographers will cringe.  Dujardin is a talented artist with a good eye for composition, styling, colors and lighting, but is sadly lacking on the technical side. She compensates for this with her own artistic sense, but alas she tries to explain photography in technical terms and fails.  She should have either steered away from technical discussions, or have those chapters written (or at least proof-read) by a more technically competent photographer. I would not recommend this book (in the present edition) to someone starting out. Or perhaps I'd tear the first half off and attach some better resources to it (ie : [[ASIN:0817439390 Understanding Exposure]] for basics, and Strobist.com for artifical light)  Some examples of inaccuracies :  Minor :     - some captions not matching the pictures (as in page 54, caption says \\"soft light\\" but it is hard and undiffused as described in the text)    - on p.31 the phrase \\"these pears were shot with a wide aperture and shallow depht of field\\"  might lead a begginner to think these are two distinct settings.  Not so minor :    - on p.81 calling a speedlight on the camera's hot shoe an \\"off-camera flash\\" (even if you bounce the light)   - on p.73 the setup shot and description are confusing. Text seems to indicate the light goes through the umbrella, bounces on the ceiling and back at the subject, but looking at the setup it seems as if most of the light hitting the food is the light bounced from the umbrella, not the ceiling.  Huge :    - on p.60 \\"the light [...] was very strong, even though it was diffused, and this created a shallow depht of field\\" : DoF does not depend on the amount or type of light.    - on p.86 \\"The second bounce further further increased the amount of light[...] and this helped to create a more pleasing depht of field\\" : same as above.  I haven't read the less technical chapters and believe (hope) that I might yet learn something valuable from this book, but I find the above issues extremely distracting.  EDIT : I have now finished reading the book. While I stand by my previous criticism, the book does fulfill its main objectives. It provides some very usefull tips for food photography, especially in the styling department (props, colors, ...) and with its beautiful pictures, it is also inspiring (both photographically and for cooking) Perhaps the \\"tips\\" could be more clearly presented (lists ?) rather than mentionned conversationnaly in the text but that is of minor importance.  I've upgraded my initial rating from 2 stars to 3.

1609410416|5.0|This is the third book for comedian/talk show host Ellen Degeneres and, if ever there was a book that should be \\"read by the author\\", it's one by Ellen. She honed her craft of comedy by doing \\"stand-up\\" and she actually \\"performs\\" the audio version, more than just reading it. Ellen talks fast and so the 3 hours on the three CDs literally fly by! And the words aren't all the same as the print edition (which I also read through). She re-wrote parts of it to \\"talk to - you - the listener\\" and even adds a chapter (Chapter 29) just for the audiobook. Speaking of chapters, the print edition does not have numbered chapters for these short essays. But Ellen announces a number before each one. Since I started with the audio version first, I wondered - when I got to the chapter titled \\"Meditation\\", which contains 20 seconds or so of silence - how she'd deal with this in the print edition. So I looked and there were three blank pages. The reverse holds true for the chapter titled \\"For the Children\\" where there are full-page illustrations to color. For the audiobook, Ellen tells the listener that there is a .pdf file on the CD with the illustrations - though I haven't checked that out yet.<br /><br />The print edition is 240 pages with short chapters and plenty of space between the lines so you can easily pick it up and put it down as time permits. These are short essays of observations on everything from being judge on American Idol to being married to her wife Portia. Either format will entertain you - it did me - if you are an Ellen fan (I am). The Print version allows you to go back and read - or share - a special chapter., while the audio version allows you to hear her voice and timing.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
0143036424|5.0|This is a very good western mystery and the cast is very entertaining. I like the Johnson's writing better than C J Box, which can get a little sappy. hard to believe this is his first novel.   The specifics of the book has been amply reviewed, but I have two observations: One, it's unfortunate but it's so very unlikely a county Sheriff and a Native American (a tribe member would never refer to him/herself as a Native American) on the rez would be bosom buddies. That cultural reality aside, it seems that all the little town's inhabitants have the same dry sense of humor. It's just a witty little oasis out there in Wyoming's hinterlands! But that's cool. Wouldn't be very interesting if everyone was just saying \\"Yep.\\"

B005KGPC4S|3.0|RED STATE will polarize the audience.  There are fans of writer/director Kevin Smith (Cop Out, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Clerks, Clerks II,  Jersey Girl, Chasing Amy, Mallrats, etc) and there are detractors.  And the country is pretty much divided now between right wing and left wing politics. A story that concentrates on the more extreme version of right wing evangelical religion is bound to cause a schism in viewers. But in the presence of all the murders of gay people like Matthew Shepard and  Lawrence King and the racist torture and decapitation of James Byrd, Jr. etc the story needs to be told.<br /><br />Opening with a trio of teenage friends - Travis (Michael Angarano, very underused in this film!), Billy-Ray (Nicholas Braun) and Randy (Ronnie Connell) -who have searched the Internet for 'physical satisfaction' they come upon a women who will take on three men - a middle aged woman Sara (Melissa Leo) in their little town - and they borrow Travis' parents' car and go off to find adventure. On the way there they sideswipe a parked car that just happens to contain the town sheriff in the middle of a same-sex act.  They eventually find Sara in her trailer house, are invited in, plied with 'beer', and once they have been narcotized they awaken in cages in the church run by Abin Cooper (Michael Parks): the church is small, contains only members of Abin Cooper's family, preaches hellfire and damnation to all gays, and have started to torture and murder the captured trio.  From this  point the story becomes almost unwatchable as the sheriff's assistant calls on the church only to get shot, the Special Agents led by Joseph Keenan (John Goodman) arrive, and a shoot out begins.  Travis escapes but is shot on his way to freedom, one of the young girls in the Abin Cooper family, Cheyenne (Kerry Bish&eacute; in a top notch performance) tries to save the children of the family to no avail, and Keenan is told by telephone to treat the church as a terrorist haven and kill everyone - a philosophy Keenan finds difficult to follow.  How the battle ends is the crux of the tale - is anyone completely free of evil or completely lacking good?<br /><br />Though the film is very heavy handed it does draw attention to one of the many forms of bigotry and prejudice that are paralyzing this country.  The idea behind the film is a sound one but the delivery of the story is so over the top that the production dilutes the impact.  Grady Harp, October 11osophy Keenan finds difficult to follow.

0596007124|5.0|I was kind of uneasy buying this book, I have NEVER bought a head first book...I've seen them at some of the larger book retailers and I've thumbed through them and quickly dismissed them as a gimmick and \\"for kids\\" due to all the illustrations and goofy quotes...I feel very sorry about that now, I have a TRUE FEELING that I would have a much deeper understanding of C++, Java, and PHP if all of Head First's books are written as well as this one...this book DOES make lots of use of \\"out of the ordinary\\" techniques when it comes to a software development book.  It DOES NOT give detailed \\"cook book\\" code samples, and it DOES NOT promise to teach you EVERYTHING there is to know about Design Patterns.  I wouldn't even say it gives you MANY \\"REAL WORlD\\" examples, nothing that you code in this book is OVERLY COMPLEX.  What this book DOES DO, is offer a SIMPLE, VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND, VERY INFORMATIVE, AND ENTERTAINING way to LEARN the most useful design patterns.  This book is everything I wanted and more, it is not a Book's job to teach me how to be creative, or how to implement their exact code into my client's software...it does do EXACTLY what it should and presents the information in an EASY to grasp way without wasting your time.  I would BUY THIS BOOK NOW.<br /><br />WARNING:  If you don't have a strong OO background before getting this book you may be making a mistake, the authors do an OK job trying to explain OO principles but if you don't understand some of the more common terms (or haven't looked at them in quite a while) it really helps to brush up prior to reading this book.  I HIGHLY recrommend Object-Oriented Thought Process by Matt Weisfeld as an introduction or refresher, it is a FANTASTIC read on OO.
B00275EGX8|3.0|\\"Hurt Locker\\" is a modern version of a movie that's been made dozens of times before for the plethora of conflicts in which the Federal Government has engaged.  The performances are great, and there is a lot of tension when it comes to defusing the bombs.  In a way, this is the old British WWII series \\"Danger UXB\\" (which is worth seeking out) tarted up with a big budget for the Second Iraq War.<br /><br />However, I didn't find this movie to be anything special.  When you get a title card that tells you how many days Bravo company has left on its tour, you know for a fact exactly what is going to happen to which member of the team, if you've ever seen a movie.  When somebody gets short, and they're in a cop or military movie, there's only one thing that can happen.  Sadly, that same cliche happens here.  The pace of the movie is overly slow.  I know they're trying to establish tension, but after 30 minutes there's no real story or plot and the audience is left wondering what exactly is going on.  We don't really get what the bomb guys are doing to defuse the bombs; they don't talk us through it or give any explanation, so you're also left wondering about the tension and when it's supposed to stop.  Hey, there's also the cliche \\"wildman\\" who breaks all the rules to do the job.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't hate this movie.  But, it's best watched with one finger on the fast forward.  I don't understand how this made \\"Best Picture.\\"  I would recommend renting this before you buy it.

1400031524|4.0|The third installment of this Swedish `noir' police procedural series takes Inspector Kurt Wallander to Riga, Latvia. Although Latvia has broken free from the Soviet Union, it is still a dictatorship and most of its institutions, including the police, are still controlled by men who are corrupt and will do anything to retain their power.  An inflatable life raft has washed ashore on the coast of Sweden. In it are two men who have been shot through the heart. Wallander investigates and, through meticulous detective work, finds out that the men were from Latvia and were known to be involved in drug trafficking. Major Liepa, an officer in the Latvian police, comes to Sweden to assist Wallander. Shortly after Liepa returns home, he is brutally killed and the Latvian police ask Wallander to come to Riga to help them determine why Liepa was murdered. From that point, the story becomes very dark. Wallander is convinced that one of Liepa's two superiors was involved in his murder. As Wallander investigates, the plot gets more intense and eventually he ends up being a murder target himself.  Mankell paints a very interesting and realistic picture of the bleak life in the Baltic States after the fall of the U.S.S.R. He shows how corruption is still the norm and that people will look the other way when offered a few Swedish kroner. As usual, Mankell reveals Wallander's thoughts so that we know his temptations, weaknesses and mistakes. But probably the main reason that most readers enjoy this series is Wallander's persistence and his resolve to push ahead regardless of the obstacles that are in his way.
0545265355|5.0|I really enjoyed these books! I made a new years resolution to read more and these were great books to start with! I finished the first one in two days and I couldnt wait to open the second! Suzanne Collins did a really great job, I recommend them to anyone above 13!
B003ES61EE|2.0|Unfortunately this Lens Pen isn't as good as the original [[ASIN:B000KO0GY6 LensPEN]]. This is basically the same thing as the original, except this has two different sizes of rubber cleaning feet. But the problem is that the rubber used here is less firm, which means when you drag it across the lens to clean, the cleaning tip bends and does not clean, whereas the original's scrubs the glass clean.<br /><br />I actually had a fleck of something on one of my lenses which this lens pen's weaker rubber tip could not remove, which the original lens pen removed easily.<br /><br />I cannot recommend purchasing this item.
0553386794|4.0|Martin fashions a story in the fantasy genre that is all encompassing and not lacking in imagination with \\"Game of Thrones.\\" King Robert Baratheon needs a new \\"Hand\\" after the death of Jon Arryn and so seeks out Eddard Stark of Winterfell, but many secrets threaten Westros and the Seven Kingdoms.<br /><br />The story opens with a threat presenting itself along the great northern wall. The threat was long thought gone, but now summer is ending and winter is coming. However, the seven kingdoms, united under King Robert are distracted by greed, avarice, pride, and secrets.<br /><br />Robert has recently lost \\"The Hand of the King,\\" Jon Arryn, so he seeks out his old friend, Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell to be the new hand. Reluctantly, Eddard agrees and travels to King's Landing with his daughters.<br /><br />When Eddard leaves the north, his bastard son, Jon Snow, goes to the wall with the intent to \\"take the black,\\" and act as a protector. Jon has an interesting story to tell as he comes to accept his new way of life.<br /><br />Robert's wife, Cersei, is a member of the Lannisters, who are wealthy and influential in their own right. Cersei has 3 children she is determined to protect and secure their birthright as Robert's heirs, however, the secret she keeps close to her breast threatens to destroy Westros from the inside.<br /><br />Another outside threat comes from the previous defeated king's progeny - Daenerys. A young woman, Daenerys and her brother, Viserys Targaryen, have sought out the help of the Dothraki to raise an army and take back Robert's throne.<br /><br />When Robert dies in a hunting accident, many discover that when you play the game of thrones you win or you die.<br /><br />Martin's novel is incredibly long, but encompasses three major plots and a host of characters. His writing is easy to read. His descriptions use a good economy of words to paint vivid pictures without lingering. The plot is intricate, but moves well, and keeps the reader turning the page.<br /><br />What makes this book shine are the characters - all of them are interesting and unique - and they all have a story to tell. Daenerys was one of my favorites. The reader meets her a young woman who learns to become more assertive with a kind heart who gains resolve from love and heartbreak. The most rewarding aspect of Daenerys and her story is watching her assume her full heritage as a Targaryen.<br /><br />\\"Game of Thrones\\" will take the reader through a gambit of emotions and leave them hungering for more.

B004FQX5CK|5.0|According to Harrison Ford, he and Scott discussed the issue at length and agreed that Deckard was/is a human being.  Evidently, after the film's release Scott got it into his head that making Deckard a replicant would be \\"cooler\\" and more poignant and made it his business to revise the story to fit his latest \\"vision.\\"
B005CM9DX6|4.0|I love all things Opeth, so I was really glad to get this in the mail from Amazon. Well, I had to listen to it three times before I made up my mind if I liked it or not. There are some really great songs, then some not so great songs. Bad part is, my favorite song on the album, Haxprocess, just seems to end way too quickly and had that vibe of a possible Opeth anthem that could have went on for another five minutes easily.   I do like the album overall, but just feel it's lacking some punch. I don't care that they didn't put any cookie monster growls, so thats not it. Just seems like there is a lot less effort put into this album over other masterful Opeth albums. probably would have given it 3 stars, but it is Opeth, and it does have some really great qualities to it, so 4 stars it is.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|If you liked or loved the movie, you have to purchase the CD.  Also recommend purchasing the More Music from Country Strong CD.  I was amazed by Gwenith's singing ability.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|My 3 year old is in love with the toy story series.  We had the first 2 in VHS from when I was younger and wanted to get the 3rd.  This was Amazon's deal of the day a while back and I happened to jump on it and am so glad I did.  We're planning a long flight in a couple weeks and the digital copy will come in super handy to download on our MP3 player.  Very satisfied with this product!

B004ZNARH4|5.0|I'll keep this short....This is an awesome box set. I haven't heard the quadraphonic version in 30 years, and that alone was worth the money. I'm not an expert on what other versions there are of this album, but the only one I had was some cheap 10 dollar version I bought when CD's first came out, so this one was a treat for me. So glad I bought it, can't wait for the others ones coming up next.

B003DZX3SA|5.0|Growing up my father always would watch Disney movies with my brother and I.   I have my own child now and I wanted to share some Disney magic with him as well! My father offered all the old vhs tapes but they're way too bulky for our apartment. Beauty and The Beast has always been one of my favorite Disney and one of my favorite films of all time.  Lion King is my top  I was sooo excited when this came to DVD since we are collecting all the Disney classics for out little one!  I was debating if we should've purchased the blu-ray combo pack but I'm sure I made the right decision. The dvd has stayed pretty true to the atosphere of the vhs version. I heard that the blu-ray was great but it took away alot of shadows. Love this dvd!! Can't wait to collect them all

B005AVIZ6U|4.0|I'm a great fan of the Jack Reacher character and series and was left in two minds as to whether this does justice to them. On the one hand, from a character development point of view, I think that THE AFFAIR is excellent and is a natural extension showing us a younger slightly less experienced and more fallible Reacher. The writing is fantastic and as usual I was hooked from the first page to the last as we follow Reacher assigned to a case by the Military Police. The description is spot on and the pace frantic, even though there is are less violent parts than some of the earlier books in the series. He is teamed up with a beautiful local Sheriff and the inevitable happens as they carry out the investigation which proves to have wide-reaching implications.  On the other hand, there are some serious flaws to the storyline itself. One is Reacher's reason for leaving the Army and the other is the rather dubious conclusion to the book. The Sheriff is just too gorgeous and the gratuitous sex scenes are over-done and unnecessary. I would have preferred to see a deeper reason for Jack leaving the Army, disagreeing with Black Ops or cruelty to prisoners of war, that sort of thing.  If the storyline was as developed as the character then this would definitely be a great thriller. As it is THE AFFAIR is good, but for me far from the best in what remains a gripping series.
B003VIW8DK|4.0|The first two tracks--You Can Dance and Alphaville hit you right away, as does BF Bass (Ode to Olympia). The others grow on you well over time. The musicians he collected for this are first rate, and the production quality is tops. I've been playing this non-stop for two weeks.    Saw him in concert last night at Strathmore Hall in Maryland. If you can catch this abbreviated US Tour it is definitely worth you while. It was a very well rehearsed and highly entertaining show, and who knows when you'll get a chance to see him again. The last time I did was the Roxy tour of 2001.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Ugh, this book is way way to long. So much so, that I couldn't finish reading it. I am over 50% done but I think I lost interested at the first couple chapters of Diana just researching, rowing, and doing yoga. Nothing suspenseful happens in this book, it just drags on. And, after reading some reviews that nothing ever happens in this book I decided to end my suffering and just stop reading it.<br /><br />There were a couple good parts in the book that peaked my interest a bit, and made me think, oh now we are going somewhere! But, then it was followed by pages and pages and pages of dull details of how Diana slept, or went riding, or did research. 600 page is way to long and I just couldn't finish it.

B005NNVPOO|5.0|I find it amazing that in 2011, so much of Pink Floyd's music from the seventies still has relevance in today's world. Animals, or parts of it anyway, was written in 1974, as evidenced by their 1975 tour for Wish You Were Here where \\"Raving & Drooling\\" and \\"Gotta Be Crazy\\" were played in concert, long before this album was released. \\"Gotta Be Crazy\\" would later become \\"Dogs\\" whilst \\"Raving & Drooling\\" would become \\"Sheep.\\" And today, these songs sum up, quite accurately, the state of our world, particularly here in the US.   We've got the \\"Pigs\\" on Wall Street... the greedy bastards who will steal money, retirement packages {IRA's/401 K's} and homes just to stuff their own pockets w/ billions of dollars of cash and equity while the middle class is being tossed aside. We've got the \\"Dogs\\" in politics who lie and and offer up false promises to the masses and of course, the \\"Pigs\\" are the ones funding them. Then we've got the \\"Sheep.\\" The gullible, for the most part, public. We have no real source for straight news here in the States, only what the \\"Pigs\\" and \\"Dogs\\" want force-fed to us and none of it actually portrays the truth or anything remotely close to the truth.  It would appear the w/ the recent Occupy Wall Street protests that people are finally waking up to these facts and are waging a war to regain control of our country. And that is a very good thing.  So how does any of this relate to the album? Well, you'll have to listen the album to find the answer to that question, but believe me, Animals sums it all up so eloquently and at times, quite harshly.   If you asked any casual fan on the street about Pink Floyd they could name three albums; Dark Side Of The Moon - Wish You Were Here - The Wall. And those are all grand albums w/ lots of deep, thought-provoking material that are also relevant today. Somehow, Animals is the album that people tend to overlook and that is a terrible tragedy.  Animals is full of angst and hatred for the powers that be and the sacrifices that so many make when they choose a path to join that group of people who have no care for the human race and are only interested in buying more and more stuff. Pink Floyd has never been an easy group to listen to... they make you think and on Animals they demand a lot. But it is so worthwhile and rewarding.  The album is one of their best and deserves its rightful place amongst those others mentioned above. For those of you who have this album, then you know what I am writing about. If you are young and don't have this album, do yourself a favor and buy it. The new remasters are exquisite and the message within will certainly set your mind in motion as you ponder your plot in the world and what possible things you can do to change the world for the better.  Animals is a classic Pink Floyd album w/ great music, lyrics and a message that has stood the test of time.
0156711427|3.0|I almost gave up on this one because almost nothing happens for the first 150 pages and the prose is extremely dry. The author paints a very precise portrait of racism and class-ism in British occupied India.<br /><br />It is easy to see why so many people hold this book in such high regard; it was obviously groundbreaking when it was published. It will never take the place of [[ASIN:0061205699 To Kill a Mockingbird (slipcased edition)]] in my heart.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|This was an excellent movie!   I wanted to see \\"Hanna\\" since the first commercial aired on TV and saw that Saoirse Ronan was going to be play the main character (loved her in \\"the Lovely Bones\\"). When I saw it at the theater came away a little disappointed with the story itself. (Not enough direct confrontation between Hanna and the bad guys). But when I saw it again at home I enjoyed it so much better ever since.  This is one of those movies (like Robert Downey Jr.'s \\"Sherlock Holmes\\")that gets better the more you watch it with no preconceived ideas on what the story would or should be.  The blu-ray was excellent. The special features were very good and enjoyable as well.
0553807919|5.0|\\"The Whole-Brain Child\\" isn't a completely new take on parenting, but it does emphasize some of the ideas that other parenting books bring up but don't really explore. The general idea is that you want to engage both the logical side and the primal side of your child's brain when you're handling parenting issues. So if, for example, your child is throwing a tantrum, you first engage the lizard brain (because that's what's in control right now) with empathy and connection and then, as the child feels felt, you help them engage the logical brain to solve the problem that caused the tantrum in the first place. I really like though the fact that the authors are very clear that there are times when you don't negotiate with your child - sometimes you have to simply be the parent and that's not wrong. While yes, you want to over time build a child who can engage and use their whole brain, they're not there yet, so you do have to be the grown up, not a therapist and not a friend.  As with any parenting book, you have to figure out what's going to work with your child and what isn't.
B004JMZWMG|4.0|This is a multi-faceted album by a multi-talented and much-beloved prog-rock supergroup. Don't be afraid of the song titles that sound as though they're classical. They are. You can either broaden your horizons and endeavor to enjoy them or simply overlook them and enjoy the other three sides of great music. Each band member got his own chance to shine then they all contributed to a fourth segment. This is fantastic music that runs the range from soft and melodic to stirring and edgy, as all of ELP's great albums did, but pushes their boundaries as well, into elements of jazz and symphony. Highlights for me include \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\", a reworking of the Aaron Copeland classic, and Greg Lake's haunting \\"C'est La Vie\\". Carl Palmer updates his own \\"Tank\\" which was the first composition he brought to the group on their debut album. This album broke away from their usual \\"formula\\" and therefore defies catagorization. I don't claim to have broad horizons but I am a fan of ELP and this album is a big reason why.
0375842209|3.0|The first thing that will hit you from this book is the original narration. The Book Thief is told to us from none other than the Grim Reaper (him/itself?)<br /><br />Apparently Old scythey sees the world in colours, but aside from some purple prose in the interludes and references to lemon hair this doesn't feature much. And ultimately I can't help but feel the insertion of this narrator is merely a 'literary' technique (and even if, this is a skillful tatic) rather than a vital part  of telling the story.<br /><br />In terms of real plot, I hate to be blaise, however The Book Thief just seems like another WWII tale involving Jews in the basement, main characters suffering for their generosity and rebellion against the Nazi regime and untimely death (I'm sure thats not a spoiler given the time period and narrator.)<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Book Thief is well-written, well-designed and a cut above your average novel. I just felt a sense of forced originality about the piece.<br /><br />Recommended but not gushing about it...
B0050PYNOY|1.0|This was one of the most unfunny movies of the year. I bought the movie because of Natalie Portman and James Franco and because I also love spoofs on the whole genre like  Mel Brooks \\"Robin Hood, Men in Tights.\\" But this movie is just bad, boring, gross and unfunny.

I couldn't put it down when I started it, and now that I've finished it, I'm wondering when I can read it again (I've got quite a backlog though). It is so well written, keeping you moving with the story as it traverses years back and forth. It's a love story...and a bit of a thriller...and a mystery. A lovely period piece, and I almost wish they'd turn it into a movie. If they did it right.
0307716988|5.0|Moonwalk is a truly amazing autobiography. Michael is the only author that can truly describe himself, his life, his feelings, and everything about him. He is like no other. That is a fact. If you would like to know Michael like ever one should: as a true real person with a heart of gold, all about love, healing the world and saving the children; You definitely need to read this book. Michael is so magical and fantastical, surely you will understand once you read his words. My strong advice to you is to order this book immediately, sit down, and be prepared to be wowed and once and for all understand the real Michael Jackson. <3

What if we are at the mercy (even more so) of major conglomerates? What if someone thought you had no soul...thus no worth? This novel brings to the forefront these questions and more. I think it gets you ready for the future that is to come.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Quick delivery, awesome movie.  It was exactly what I was expecting.   This movie though it is not noted on the site is rated PG. This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. It is a nice spin of returning to oz with some new and interesting characters (tic toc, the couch, jack pumpkin head). Just keep in mind if your kid is under 5 it may be a bit creepy because the witch collects heads and wears them and may come off as scary. 6 year old boy loved it!
0553801473|2.0|Time magazine is supposed to put Martin on a par with Tolkien.  He's not even close.  If one wants to read of the vile and wicked continually triumphing and the good and righteous forever flaming in defeat and death, this is for you. For me, life is too short to spend it reading material like this with no hope of victory for the good. Martin weaves a score of characters into a huge, wide-ranging tapestry, but why do the evil always get the upper hand?  I won't be reading any more of this.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I love, love, love this book. I read it on the recommendation of a friend and really should send her some flowers or chocolates to thank her.   I will say that my favourable response is due to the Christian Grey character. He is so complex. He is domineering, controlling but he is also vulnerable. He is brilliant, sexy, seemingly unreachable but he meets Ana and gradually begins to unbend - at least a little. I actually had a hard time figuring out what his character saw in Ana that was so attractive. My first thought is that it was her klutziness that charmed him initially. That and he was immediately sexually attracted to her. After that, I think it was her innocence that really drew him in. He couldn't resist her for whatever reason. So much so that he completely changed his modus operandi for her. He didn't have relationships but he was willing to try it for her. Just as she was willing to try to be what he needed.   The cliffhanger ending made me insane but I was fortunate the second book, Fifty Shades Darker, was already released when I discovered this series. Once I read both books, I went back and read them again.  A word of caution though - this book is an erotic romance and features discussions of BDSM and some BDSM sexual scenes.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Harry Potter part 1, I was a little skeptical being a part one movie, would rather they kept the movies in a full start and finish type thing it just makes the consumer have to watch another movie, I love Harry Potter and its still hard to wait for the last movie. I will forget some and they will replay half in the new one to waste time and space and make a cheaper movie. Well hope part 2 is as good as this. picture and sound are fantastic.
B005F6NA56|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Having recorded a song quite as ubiquitous as \\"1234\\" which when attached to an advert for the I Pod Nano helped shift the little sound units by the millions, tends to be the defining \\"fact\\" of Leslie Feist's career thus far. Alternatively very clever people who read Amazon reviews know that this joyous little pop song is the proverbial tip of a very large iceberg when it comes to Feist's talent and what we have with her new album is the productions of some very powerful song craft that leads to the production of very precious metals.<br /><br />Straddling the world between her indie roots in the great Canadian band Broken Social Scene and appearances on Sesame Street are all taken in her stride by Leslie Feist although on this new album there is too much for the Muppets to sing about. Indeed \\"Metals\\" is a darker beast than its predecessor (which also had its moments) but ultimately an altogether stronger and more mature album. It opens with the pounding \\"The bad in each other\\" a great folky song which sees Feist almost mixing the Fleet Foxes with Kate Bush to great effect. The next two songs are amongst the most haunting on the album and show her emerging as a major songwriting talent. First up is \\"Graveyard' with a tender vocal and an almost Tom Waits style backdrop full of horns and an extended exhortation to the inhabitants of the burial ground to \\"Bring them all back to life\\". The third song \\"Caught a long wind\\" has that sort of icy beauty that Sufjan Stevens has made such a trademark and is a stunning highlight. Alternatively \\"How come you never go there\\" is a light soulful blues ballad which stands in sharp contrast. The pivot of the album is \\"A Commotion\\" a thumping anthem of indie pop full of deep male chants, violins and thumping drums. This one may split the jury but it shows an artist prepared to take risks which largely work. More gentle are the lovely proceeding tracks \\"The circle married the line\\" and the sumptuous \\"Bittersweet Melodies\\". Your reviewers favourite track thus far is the five minute plus haunting slow jazz of \\"Anti Pioneer\\" a burning love song which not be out of place on a Cat Power album.<br /><br />Throughout the album Feist sings brilliantly no more so on the hushed alt country acoustics of \\"Cicada's and gulls\\" or on the ethereal closer \\"Get it get it wrong\\". Undoubtedly some may bemoan the lack of catchy radio friendly accessibility which previous songs like \\"I feel it all\\" and \\"My moon my man\\" had in spades. Indeed the Amazon download appears to omit two other tracks that are widely available namely the gothic blues of \\"Pine Moon\\" which Nick Cave should cover ASAP and the much more feisty soul of \\"Woe be\\" (answers on a postcard please?). Frankly while they are both great songs neither are hits waiting to trouble the charts. In the last analysis accepting that the vibe of \\"Metals\\" tends to locate it in more pensive corners which she explored on \\"The Reminders\\" Overall the feel of this album is autumnal and like the wonderful season that it captures Feist infuses \\"Metals\\" with the feeling that the possibilities of summer are gone, and the chill of winter is on the horizon. You would be foolish not to let this album soundtrack the forthcoming months.ers favourite track thus far is the five minute plus haunting slow jazz of \\"Anti Pioneer\\" a burning love song which not be out of place on a Cat Power album.   Throughout the album Feist sings brilliantly no more so on the hushed alt country acoustics of \\"Cicada's and gulls\\" or on the ethereal closer \\"Get it get it wrong\\". Undoubtedly some may bemoan the lack of catchy radio friendly accessibility which previous songs like \\"I feel it all\\" and \\"My moon my man\\" had in spades.

B005K2KCPG|5.0|Great album from start to finish.  I've been listening to it for 5 days now and cant get enough. This is the best rock record released in  years.
0385344325|5.0|For long time fans, reading a Jack Reacher thriller can be compared to eating comfort food--it is something you are comfortable with, know intimately about, and fulfilled by in some way.  The loyal readers quickly slip into the prose, spot on descriptions, realistic dialogue, and the Reacher style and find themselves quickly carried away by another darn good read that displays all of Reacher's superb analytical skills, commitment to justice, and hard nosed violence.  Lee Child is adept at creating a Reacher World that we all know and love.  In \\"The Affair\\", Child provides us with the backstory of how Reacher decided to leave his job as a Major in the military police to become the roaming paladin for justice and balance in a sordid world of corruption and danger. It is 1997 and Reacher is sent in undercover to Carter Crossing, Mississippi to investigate the killing of a local that may be tied to someone local or to someone at a nearby army post that supplys troop transports to Kosovo.  He ultimately teams with a beautiful ex-marine, Elizabeth Deveraux, who is now sheriff of this small military town and who has hit a wall of silence in her own investigations.  The locals want to blame the military--especially when 3 other earlier similar deaths are revealed, and the military wants to blame the locals, while protecting the good name of the army.   Reacher initially is not sure how much to trust Deveraux and later is given further reason not to trust her.  But Reacher is Reacher and his loyal readers know he will always trust his gut and instincts.  He knows something is foul in Carter Crossing and Fort Kelham and his sense of right and wrong is so acute that he will risk his own career to get to the bottom of the killings and exact Reacher justice.  Along the way he develops a romantic relationship, deals with a local family of red neck bullies, causes considerable consternation for powerful military leaders along with a US Senator, and goes head to head with a citizen's paramilitary group.  And the mystery that encompasses the whole mission is solved a step at a time in the typical Reacher manner of leg work, instinct, and intuitive analysis.  \\"The Affair\\" is a fun read that I found compelling and engrossing.  There is the right blend of all the elements that make Jack Reacher so enjoyable as Lee Child's signature character, yet it is slightly disconcerting to read of a younger Reacher following through on his always right instincts in a search for justice that will likely end his military career (which we know to be true) and which starts him out on his cross country ramblings that have spawned 15 other thrillers.  I have been a Jack Reacher fan since his debut in \\"The Killing Floor\\" and while some of his thrillers are considered better than others, \\"The Affair\\" is must reading for those interested in Reacher's backstory as well as those interested in a glimpse of the younger Reacher just starting to flex his persona as the traveling equalizer.  A highly recommended addition to the Jack Reacher thrillers.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Harry Potter has done it again, I am a great fan of this series and can't wait for more, picture and sound quality are fantastic.
031603441X|5.0|[[ASIN:B003UBTX72 Life]]<br />A wild ride through Rock and Roll history, but what an eye-opener about the \\"real\\" Keith Richards.<br />I was pleasantly surprised to discover the man behind the image.<br />He's funny, caring, deeply loyal, a loving father and grandfather and a superb musician, whose lifelong passion is MUSIC, which he wrote about so eloquently!<br /><br />I loved this book and was sorry to get to the end.<br />I read it on my Kindle and now I'm thinking about buying the hardback book - that's how much I enjoyed it!<br />Well played, Keith.
B004J4RQIM|4.0|I liked the music selection, except the participation of the Seal because he has just a little spoiling the performance of their duet partners. Worst of all was the sound quality of the recording of vocals where you can hear an annoying high-frequency distortion in the vocals, a sort of sparkle that at first appear to be defective of the treble speakers, but it is not. The same problem on sound  also appears on the CD. The image of the show it is spectacular, very crisp, five stars, but I'll give only four stars for sound quality (both BD and CD).
B004HNTER6|1.0|I live in California and the vendor sent a DVD for use in Europe!!!  Not sure how a mistake like this was made!!!!!
1554512115|2.0|I love the Paper Bag Princess I got the board book because my daughter is hard on books.  I was disappointed that the board book was missing parts of the story. I never thought they would edit and abridge the story if I had known that I would never got this version of the book I am so sad.:(
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I preordered this item the first day it shown up on amazon @$56. For some reason the price was bumped up but subsequently brought down to $56 again. That is a good price for this set. It obviously includes the 13 regular series episodes it also includes:<br /><br />1. The final season of Confidential(cut-downs as in previous sets)<br />2. A Christmas Carol<br />3. Space & Time (CIN  Mini Episode)<br />4. Death is the only answer (Mini episode written by junior school winners)<br />5. Plus a list of other bonus features
B005LY4B0A|5.0|this game is challenging, and can get frustrating due to limited &quot;hints&quot; given to solve the webs. if u come back to it later, sometimes u can figure it out anyway. i like it. a peaceful, puzzle type game.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|Yes, this is a very nice set to have, but really it's most useful for the SD card reader.  Makes for a very nice way to clean off memory cards and instantly look at pictures on the iPad.  Now it'd be nice if there was some software to compress the pictures or do some basic editing.  Not cheap, but worth having.
B001E45XT4|2.0|I was disappointed because I bought these for my husband's birthday. I typed \\"x box 360 headset\\" into the search and these came up. Everyone had such great reviews I thought wonderful!! When I received them, they said PC compatible and they do not fit in the x box 360. They are useless to me now. My husband and I are both in Afghanistan, so it is too much of a pain to return them. I don't know if they have converters, but I wasn't expecting to need one.
B0058WFO06|5.0|With Grace For Drowning, Steven Wilson achieves musical apex.  Grace For Drowning seems a long time coming for Mr. Wilson. The range of influences in this album are incredible, and manage to create an amazing listening experience. Dark, experimental, jazzy, lonely, and erratic are some ways to describe Grace For Drowning... but the only way to really \\"describe\\" the album has to be done through careful listening. GFD gets only better and better with each listen. The production value, as always, is extremely good.   Without a doubt certainly one of Steven Wilson's greatest works. If you're a fan of experimental, dark, progressive, or jazz music, please do yourself a favor and purchase this LP. You will not regret it. Bravo, Mr. Wilson, you have once again surpassed all expectations!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Gets the mind occupied and thinking in a relaxed,  problem-solving mode. Helps take my mind off of work before bed. A good stress reliever.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter is unlike anything - any story- ever seen or heard of. This movie has a much different feel than the others; the love, the friendship, the growing up, all that is behind and it's time to test everything you have ever known.   But ignoring the fact that the story is just plain out brilliant, this is for the movie.   I do think the beginning was, well, pretty rushed. Strange considering they split the book in two and this was the shortest movie yet (I believe it is, I haven't checked.) So I was upset that they did that, and there were a few other things I wished they had kept, like Harry returning the Elder Wand to where it came from after he fixed his own instead of breaking it. And other tidbits like that.   I am giving it 5 stars because it's story was so great and the emotional aspect of it was so high that it surpasses those flaws. We won't get another Harry Potter movie (unless they decide to remake them, I will NOT watch remakes of it) ever again, so this last movie is precious. No movie next year, or the year after that, this is it, the last, so why be negative?   Point is I loved it, loved it so much because overall the movies carried out the story the way they were meant to. Besides, after a while if the movie fanatics want more HP they can read the books and read what the movies missed.  Long live Harry Potter
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I loved the first song I heard on the American Idol Show, I Love You This Much, but, I was delighted with the entire album, every song is a hit.  You will not be disappointed!!  Scotty McCreery's first album is sure to be just one of many, many more to come.  This young man is extremely talanted.
0143038419|5.0|In 1976, Sovereign played a role in Operation Brisk; the submarine surfaced at the geographical North Pole on 20 October 1976 as part of the exercise, testing navigational systems and equipment performance in low temperatures.  Sovereign underwent an extensive refit in the mid 1990s and was rededicated in January 1997. Cracks were discovered in the tailshaft during post-refit sea trials and she was sent to Rosyth for 14 weeks of emergency repairs in June 1998 before returning to Faslane.
B0058VW36U|5.0|i was very surprised by this game. i thought it was a game for toddlers, but I was pleasantly surprised at how challenging and fun it is.  2 thumbs up
B000E5N6LG|2.0|Well This film is well typical for A Costner flick, Like most of his films around this time it is long (To long) and it is almost painful to watch.  This Director decided to focus on the \\"Dark Side\\" of Wyatt Earp and it told the story that Tombstone did not while many would disagree with me I think this film is just as fictional as Tombstone only this film takes longer to reach the same conclusion.  Not only is the film rather long but you get the same acting from Kevin Costner as you got with other films that came out in the 90's with costner in them (EX. Dances with Wolves).  I did like some of Costers films but this one kinda made me mad with the poor acting and long drawn out story.  IMO I would pass on this film expecialy if your looking for a action film Tombstone dose have alot more action and also has a little better acting....  Of corse this is all IMO...
B0058VW36U|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Which is good because if I did not I would never wait around for it to load. It has a great variety of easy and hard levels so I never get irritated at an unpassable level. It also does not defy gravity the way Angry Birds does. Super bonus.   If you are waiting a long for the game to load, I promise, it is worth it! Patience Grasshopper!
B004DMIIOG|5.0|You don't need to be an anime geek to enjoy this.  It's like Neal Stephenson and Hayao Miyazaki had an anime baby...
0385534639|5.0|Morgenstern's prose is a rare jewel of elegance and beauty.  Yet, it also has an engaging and unusual story, without which, even the finest descriptions fall flat.  Well worth the time.  Several reviewers feel that it dragged a bit in the middle.  Perhaps understandable.  Yet, to me it seemed more subtle than simply going on too long, or piling on extraneous details.  The characters are caught up in a game that goes on for over thirty years.  We begin to feel as the characters themselves do.  When are things going to change?  What is really going on?  Where are all our efforts leading?  This seems to me yet another indication of Morgenstern's skill rather than a lack of it.  Besides, even when the story slows down, there is still plenty of scenery to admire.  The rich descriptions that are vivid yet maintain an air of mystery, are quite as magical as the Le Cirque des Reves itself.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Amazon just delivered this CD to my door, so I played it.  It hits every heart string I have.    Scotty captured my attention on American Idol.  He is wholesome, genuine and true to himself.   His music comes from the heart and speaks to all those raised in small town America with family  values passed on from generations.   His music is relevant, honest and fresh.  Give him an ear, you won't regret it.    I'm looking forward to more of this young artist.
086571701X|5.0|Big Thanks to Sylvia for writting an engaging, organized and comprehensive \\"how to\\" for all us aspiring aquapons. It is just what I needed to get started.
1592536913|1.0|1,000 Steampunk creations?  I think not.  Multiple creations throughout the book are shot at different angles and entered into this book as another creation.  Also, there is no title of what each creation is or even a description.  I feel this book is just a bunch of pictures that you can see on the internet by looking up the creators.  This book is uninspired and uninspiring to anyone looking for information about the Steampunk genre.  I plan to return this book and I don't recommend it to anyone else.
1609611543|5.0|I can't recommend this book highly enough.  For people on the Standard American Diet (or any typical grain-based western diet), following the advice in this book will almost certainly improve health in drastic and varied ways, including not only the loss of excess body fat, but also improvement or outright curing of many health problems from minor maladies to major diseases.<br /><br />But if you're skeptical of these claims, it's easy to test them: simply cut all wheat products out of your diet for 30 days.  It must be *all* wheat and gluten: no bread, no pasta, no cereal, etc, and if you eat packaged/processed foods, then check the labels to make sure they're wheat-free.  If you are overweight or have any health issues at all, they will likely be improved if not totally solved.  Then you can buy the book to learn all the science and research behind why modern wheat causes and exacerbates so many health problems.<br /><br />One final note: you'll need to replace all those wheat carb calories with something, and that something should ideally be meat, vegetables, and healthy fats like butter, coconut oil, and olive oil.  It should not be sugary foods, industrial seed oils (aka vegetable oils), nor other types of grains (most of which are also not great for you, though not as bad as wheat).  Fruit and potatoes are generally fine too, though you may want to go easy on them if you have weight to lose.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|I've played better games in this genre but the concept is okay the playability is not the best it has a lot of issues with navigating your character.  graphics are a bit choppy and block like.  gameplay is average at best a little dull and repetitive ok after a while.  once again if you're looking to kill a little time this 1 is sufficient but not much beyond that.
B001NB6L2G|4.0|As an American, I knew this album as \\"Happy Jack,\\" and enjoyed the \\"title song\\". However, this digital version has all kinds of strange stuff. And the \\"title song\\" (from my youth) is missing. An accoustical version (very nice in itself) is added in the after-thought section. But I wanted my memories back. So I bought the single of \\"Happy Jack\\" (the \\"I saw ya\\" version), and twiddle with iTunes to insert it in the original queue.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, when I looked up the lyrics to these songs, I was amazed. I had memorized all the words, and what was published didn't quite fit my memory. However, now that I hear the music in its pure, digital form, the lyrics come through crisp and clear. In effect, I am encountering The Who again for the first time!
B0058P7KUA|4.0|I would say, that if my 5 year old can play it its a nice app to have.<br />Time killer for a while...
B00005176F|5.0|I have really enjoyed listening to this CD. I had not heard alot of these songs in such a long time. It has all of my favorites and it reminded me of why I liked Blur so much in college. Just a very fun upbeat band! Even my 16 year old neice was enjoying the CD and had never heard them before. I would recommend this albuum!
B005A1ER0I|5.0|simply put, this is the best instrumental album i've ever heard. and i'm super picky about my music! i came across this album by accident, and haven't stopped listening since! don't let the cover fool you; it's not a disney album. :) so, basically, you should buy it. buy it now!
B003L77GRO|4.0|I HAVE BEEN ENJOYING Dexter since it started. Last year I decided not to pay for Showtime and wait for the release of the fifth season.  This year I don't think I can wait and will most likely order Showtime to watch Dexter and Homeland.  The DVD arrived quickly and undamaged.
B005EXA8LY|5.0|WOW! What a piece of work! The reviews I've read listed here are excellent and I won't attempt to overly expand what's already been written. I will say this music , mixed by Mr. Wilson is a Masterpiece. If your a music lover and happen to own a mid to high end Home Theater this will blow you away as it did me. Expect the unexpected and sit back , close your eyes and enjoy the ride. Amazing!
B005RK6EUS|5.0|It's been an amazing journey from \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" to here, but well worth every minute of waiting for this answer to all questions saving ONE.  The wit and imagination and pure creative mischief that went into the entire series was entirely eclipsed by THIS!  ANOTHER MUST OWN EPISODE.  I've watched it five times in under 48 hours just to glean every possible detail, putting the puzzle all together.  And it fits.  And it is fitting that, even with all the delicious reveals, the Doctor hides just enough to keep us completely hooked and waiting with tingling anticipation for series 7 to commence.  BRAVO!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele bares her soul to us thru her music and I haven't heard anything like it since the 60s and that was J. Joplin. May she have a long life and bare her soul for many more generations. Thank you Adele.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I purchased this exact set of headphones back in 1993.  I use them constantly, and they still work GREAT!  One of my oldest and most reliable pieces of equipment.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Not sure what all the negative reviews are about. I have an htc evo and it works great. I mean it's unofficial people.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|i have to say my brain was twisted in knots the first time i read it but after the third time towards the end i finally figured it out
B00122M2QU|5.0|The Cavalera brothers are together again, and when these guys meet each other to make music the music is heavy. Absolutely heavy and cool heavy metal, like i haven´t heard in a long time. Inflikted don´t bring nothing new to the heavy metal world, but it´s a mix of good metal songs together. Well done, Cavalera brothers!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I really appreciated and could relate to this movie. I adopted a dog from a pet orphanage whose male owner had died. She immediately became attached to my husband.  One day soon after I got her, my husband left for work and  she kept going in his closet, the shower, etc. looking for him.  I thought she was sick and I took her to the vet because she was shaking in fear.  Now I realize she was afraid my husband would never return.    This must have been how it was for Hachi.  Like Hachi, she tried to escape when we first got her, and still goes up to any man she meets thinking maybe it is her deceased prior owner.  She is now happy, but at around 4 in the afternoon, she waits by the utility room door for my husband to come home through the garage.   Too bad Hachi could not have found peace or closure. I guess the heartache was too much to bear and the love he had for his owner could have never been transferred to another.  It was his since of devotion and duty to wait for his owner's return.  This movie is priceless and the director captured the pain and heartbreak in the dog's expressions.
B000001A3H|5.0|BLUES FOR RED SUN is one of the best HEAVY ROCK albuns ever!!!!! All the songs are contagious, with the perfect combination of BLACK SABBATH on the desert with some METALLICA roars ....ONE OF THE BEST ALBUNS EVER!!!!! REALLY!!!! Also, pick SKY VALLEY and CIRCUS LEAVES TOWN!!!!!! You will not regret!!!!! KYUSS is AMAZING!!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!
B0057GYOA4|1.0|They absolutely screwed up this awesome record by horrible mastering. One \\"appeal\\" of Nirvana's music was the difference between louder and quieter passages, but in this \\"Remaster\\" everything is just LOUD. That's annoying and was not intended by Kurt Cobain. This is ear fatiguing garbage, it is sad that the next generation will be unabale to experience the music in the way it was meant to be once this \\"remaster\\" has become the standard record!!!!  Do not buy crap like that. Google \\"Loudness War\\" and buy the 1991 CD, please!
B000062YB1|5.0|The great classic from Slayer is Reign in blood, but Seasons in the Abyss is the one i like the most in Slayer´s discography. All the songs are great thrash metal gems, i really can´t point a highlight in this gorgeous album.If you like Slayer, you just can´t live your life without hearing Seasons in the Abyss.
0446585025|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but I had to review this book because I love Ellen and love this book and want it to be successful for her! Funniest most witty book I have read in a long time. You really have to know and appreciate Ellen's humor to read and understand this book. It very much reminds me of her stand up comedy dvd \\"here and now\\". It is a lot of the same humor and I can literally hear her voice and how she says things while I am reading this book. This book is not only hysterical but it also has really wonderful words of wisdom in it. She brings you back to a much simpler time and makes you realize how ridiculous life has gotten with laziness, busy-ness, and technology to name a few. I read this book in a day and it was amazing from the first word to the last.
B0034G4P8A|2.0|I only give it two stars because I like the genre, but this thing is pretty sorry.  The plot line is completely predictable and phoned in.  I mean, what's with Marvel and all this \\"magic ice\\" and  \\"super energy source\\" stuff ?  It's such a lame crutch and cliche.  Can't they think of anything else ?  The action sequences were either completely over the top and blurry (Ice Giant fight), or totally silly and uninteresting (Earth fight).  The climax was so confusing and ham-fisted, I just gave up.  Like most recent cinematic offerings, this movie offers zero suspense, mystery, or intrigue.  The idea that Thor was longing for Portman's character, at the end, was ridiculous.  The movie developed zero foundation for such a longing.  Overall, one of the worst superhero flicks I have ever seen.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Most of us already knew you were a fantastic and talented young artist from watching you on Idol. Of course there are others who may not know you at all or who weren't totally sold on youl. If after listening to this album they don't see the God given talent you have then nothing can be done to help them. You have proved you have the total package you sing every song with emotion and bring the listener into it as if we are there with you. YOur voice is so pleasant to listen to that you can play this cd all day long and not get tired of listening to it. I have my favorites such as Dirty Dishes-as I'm a mom to Walk In the COuntry and You Make that look good but I can honestly say there is not a song on there that I don't love. I will always have a special place for I Love you this big as you took a simple song and made it fit for many types of situations. If you buy this album you will NOT be disappointed
B002C6A6N6|4.0|I am a big fan of Dr. Quinn and when it aired on TV it had closed caption.  I do not hear well so when the set arrived and does not have closed caption or subtitles I was very disappointed.  I have to turn the volumn up full blast and then I still don't understand most of what is said.  I would like to find this product that has closed caption or subtitles so I can enjoy it and \\"hear\\" it.
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|Good little monster movie. But instead of a monster movie with kids you get a kid's<br />movie with monsters. Good for a view or two, it keeps you interested to the end.<br />As another reviewer stated...its 75% kids and 25% monster.
0061537934|3.0|Okay, I enjoyed the book.  It was a nice read.  It wasn't something that left me bereft when it was over, as the best books do.  Which is to say that I couldn't have cared less whether I ever met the human protagonist, Denny, again.  But the book helped me understand why some people like auto racing.  And it was absorbing.  I have some real problems with this book, though.  The dog thinks like a human and wishes it were human.  The author seems to believe that dogs think like humans.    That is where the danger of this book to your own pet comes in:  dogs do not think like humans.  At all.  When we pretend that they do--lying, manipulating, understanding our language, and so on--we can torture them with what we thought was kindness.    Animals, as separate beings, deserve our respect, yes--but the sole aim of a dog is to achieve security, and that means doing whatever he has learned will grant him that end.    Dogs are not humans.  Dogs do not plot and contrive.  So it was a pleasant book, but God help the poor dog whose human has read this book and picked up ideas about what his dog is really thinking.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I've read every Reacher novel, and in my opinion, this is the best yet. Like another reviewer noted, it was getting a little old to have Reacher stumble into another small town and into a corrupt/criminal sub-culture he must destroy. This novel covers his last investigation with the Army and sets up the \\"nomad\\" he is to become. Though a couple of iscenes were a bit hard to swallow (no spoiler here), it all worked out well in the end. Would love to see a future novel with a resurection of Sgt. Naegler (sp). If you are a Reacher fan, you won't be disappointed!
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Its not formatted to fill the screen on evo 3d. Want my money back, I just brought it! Lame game! Should just got the hd version but that 1 is not on sale. Lame!
B005DZMODI|4.0|I thought no more pretentious people existed in the known universe/multiverse/all known dimensions than Wynton Marsalis and Eric Clapton then I read some reviews of this CD and realized their fan base is even worse! I bought this CD on impulse even though frankly I dislike both artists and was pleasantly surprised. Marsalis channels his New Orleans roots--a variety of music still quite alive in New Orleans no matter what other reviewers might say--to make a totally fun CD and Eric Clapton enthusiastically tries to keep up without totally failing. Some smashing playing here and no attempt to remake the known universe etc.<br /><br />Not a great CD but a load of fun! I don't quite know what to advise a Marsalis or Clapton fan, since I cannot channel that mentality, but someone who just enjoys music should find this an enjoyable CD. And it is a kick to hear the stadium rock anthem Layla played like a Dixieland romp, with Marsalis greatly improving the long slow solo that ends that strangely pretentious piece of pain.
1439153663|5.0|The characters in this book will haunt me for awhile I believe.  I truly grew to \\"know\\" each of them and found myself wanting to help them or harm them. I am a New England Yankee, so I don't really know the true history of slavery in the south...but I can only imagine that many people led lives such as is portrayed in this excellent novel.  Highly recommended.
B005COO1X6|3.0|This short story by Stephen King is something of a wash for me. Although I thought it had an interesting premise, the tale was just too long-winded for the subject matter. It's sort of a Night Shift caliber story and should have been more quickly paced, but King rambles, especially toward the beginning, as we follow an unremarkable boy while he pedals around town, drinks, plays darts by himself and then falls asleep. I found myself growing as bored as the child was in the story. Once the killings start, the story gets a little more interesting, but, alas, the ending is abrupt and seems quite implausible. It would have been better to keep the monster's origins more mysterious. In summary: okay story for the price, but not much new here, even for diehard King fans like myself.<br /><br />--Rod Redux, authot of Mort and The Oldest Living Vampire Tells All
0446547603|2.0|Ok, in all fairness I haven't finished this book and so I will change my review once I am done, and also, I am LISTENING to the audio version of this book on cd.  The narrator is really doing a great job of putting me to sleep! She sounds like she is really bored and I am trying my best to get into this book.  After writing this review I am going to take a quick nap and get back with you if/when I finish the book...  *** Shewwwwww, I just finished listening to Safe Haven on audio CD and I can't say that I really care for it.  The writing was elementary and there was just no life to it. It was a fluff filled story that wasn't much different from the other romance books out there. I could appreciate the story line of Katie (Erin) getting away from her abusive husband and starting a new life, but this book just didn't pull it off enough for me.  I've listened to other Spark's book and they seemed better written than this one. I was disappointed and very tired because the narrator was A-W-F-U-L.   I wonder if Sparks knew she was reading his material in such a    I-am- soooooo- incredibly- bored type of voice?  I only finshed it because I started my review and hoped it would pick up...sad to say it never did and hence the 2 stars!

1593272200|5.0|I accidentally bought this book on the kindle for a pretty hefty price, but I am so glad I did. In the last week that I have been reading it, I have learned so much. For the last three years I have been using GNU/Linux as my preferred desktop and have been fascinated with the community around it. In my spare time I like to dig into my favorite programs just to see how they work (can't do that with Mac or Windows) and I have always wondered about how exactly libraries worked. This information is available on the internet, but you have to dig around. This book filled in a lot of the details, and from the moment I started reading it, I could not put it down. Excellently written and precisely executed. I am going to buy the hard cover just to have it on my shelf!

B004I1WIWU|4.0|For everyone who has spent any time listening to Adele's sophomore effort \\"21\\", you know that this amazing songstress lays the groove down on this record.  I think there is enough for you to make the decision to purchase this on content alone; however, if you are looking purchasing this in vinyl then here are some item to make you aware of what you are getting. The album is not a gatefold but the inner sleeve does have some artwork.  The vinyl is of really good quality.  I had to make some pretty drastic adjustments to my systems eq to keep the material from booming.  With that done the listening was really solid.
0307888681|5.0|This book was great! It felt like I was reading an account of an actual historical event. As a history buff, I loved it! All of the different perspectives make it that much more enjoyable. You can tell the Max really put time into every character and all of their back stories. I hope to read more from him in the future, from more WWZ lore to anything he chooses to write, if they are as well written as this.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Truly. Like dust I have cleared from my eye, this record will open your eyes to the true musical talent of Steven Wilson.  This is one of the greatest records of all time.  The album has a little bit of everything, jazz, rock, electronic, heavy bass lines and twists and turns that truly keep you engaged in the music. Try not to bounce in your seat during 'Sectarian' or roll with the clever bass lines in 'Remainder the Black Dog', I was loving every minute of Grace for Drowning.   A brief track by track run-down of Grace for Drowning (without spoiling too much):  VOLUME 1: DEFORM TO FORM A STAR  1. Grace for Drowning - A peaceful and calm piano/vocal opening to the album.  2. Sectarian - This instrumental track gets things going immediately and you'll be rocking out wondering what just happened, in a good way!  3. Deform To Form a Star - This is a great ballad, with some atmosphere to it.  4. No Part of Me - A very clever electronic track that takes a turn toward the heavy side at the end, amazing.  5. Postcard - A piano piece, very much Steven Wilson style. The ending is eerie.  6. Raider Prelude - Postcard flows right into this track, and I love Raider Prelude. It reminds me of a fantasy world, very beautiful track. It proves that Steven could write movie soundtracks (and I'm sure one day he will ;-), hint hint Steven!).  7. Remainder The Black Dog - One of the best tracks on the record, it encompasses just about everything that this album is about. I love the 2nd half, the bass lines are phenomenal. The title is also a great one.  VOLUME 2: LIKE DUST I HAVE CLEARED FROM MY EYE  1. Belle De Jour - A homage to Spanish Cinema, a short and entertaining instrumental. The Blu-Ray version comes with a exclusive video that really enhances this track, check it out if you can!  2. Index - Potentially my favorite on the record. I find it to be possibly the most unique track on GFD, it's got a catchy beat/vocals and w/ strings building up to an epic ending.   3. Track One - This track takes you for a ride, short and fun....you'll enjoy it.  4. Raider II - One of Steven Wilson's best songs. The track has a bit of everything similar to 'Remainder'. I love those two main notes (also found in 'Raider Prelude'), this track has a creepiness to it. Excellent vocal sections throughout, I've been singing the vocal parts for days now....\\"A player inside your home, I'm raiiiiiiiiiider\\".  5. Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye - The conclusion to Grace For Drowning, a very peaceful jazzy peace with an atmospheric ending. A fitting end to an extraordinary ride.  Pick this album up, experience true music, true art. Give it a few spins and enjoy the ride, then share it with your friends and your family. Music is more than just Nsync pop ballads with no flavor, it's an art and it's something that Steven Wilson has perfected. Music is beauty and this is music at it's best.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|They thought of everything. There was nothing left out.  The zippers are rubber (read nothing to scratch) and even have leather tabs to hide under on the inside where they might come in contact w a lens. The chest strap has elastic on it and the waistband is long enough to fit around my considerable girth. There are lots of pockets both inside and out and even a strap to attach my tripod. The dividers inside are the standard velcro, but there are enough pieces to pack it any way you want. I have room for my camera body, 3 lenses, 2 flashes and accessories, filters and even a tablet for notes. That doesn't even include the zippered pockets where I have cables and additional memory -- all stored in nice neat categories. And I can't believe the price!  How did Amazon produce such a nice camera case at such a reasonable price?

B004132HZS|5.0|As an Arthur Conan Doyle fan, I have to say this is absolutely perfectly updated.

B00005JKZV|5.0|Anyone who enjoys Tolkien's work would have to conclude that Tolkien would be pleased with this film of The Two Towers. It brings to life the magic of the story and maintains the integrity. The acting is great, the special effects powerful, and the battle scenes reflect the confusion and terror that hand-to-hand battles must have offered. It's excellent.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The documentary point of view is very neutral, no underlying swipe at Capitalism, just bringing both sides of the aisle to task for decades of messing around and laughing at safeguards institued after 1929.<br /><br />The viewer may want to keep the PC perculating during his/her screening, as I did, keywording things like \\"securitization wiki\\". (Note Review title).<br /><br />I enjoyed the interviews with Eliot Spitzer, the guy who attempted to investigate Wall Street well before 09-15-08...and instead got investigated - not for professional behavior but for personal behavior. C'est la vie. The interviews with Barney Frank<br />should have been more extensive, however, as it is popular to *blame* him for the Crash! (Recall a wonderful, \\"fair and balanced\\" interview conducted by Bill O'Reilly with BF?).<br />Was Frank simply asserting the Law as Gatekeeper of subprime housing loans? (Not my area of expertise).<br /><br />The documentary starts quietly in the tiny country of Iceland where \\"it all started\\":<br />where de-regulation of banks was the order of the day - a microcosm of sorts of the early '80s activity of the Reagan administration to \\"get out of the way\\" of Merrill-Lynch, et. al, and open the first Wall Street Casino. It took about five years for the S & L crisis - the \\"Keating Five\\" to go down. 1987. Around 2008, Reagan's VP's son was submitting a bill to send 700 billion bucks to bail out all those nice folks downtown. Obama implemented the bill and was called a Socialist ever since.<br /><br />Very effective camera work - many interviewees find themselves in the stark setting of a high-rise skeleton: not a waste-paper basket to be found on 30 floors.<br /><br />A likely companion to this effort might be Michael Moore's CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY, another very engaging effort with many memorable sequences, but with that uncomfortable pro-Socialist underpinning. Moore's FARENHEIT could also be referenced - perhaps the INSIDE JOB filmmakers coukld have made an even better film if they worked in some background with that earlier cataclysm - the physical attack on the American financial system. Was it a kind of dark impetus to *really* pull out the stops and create artificial incentives and questionable liaisons with academia?earlier cataclysm - the physical attack on the American financial system.

0385534639|4.0|THE NIGHT CIRCUS is definitely a book with a hype surrounding it, and like any book with hype, I went in with low expectations.  I am by my own admission not a big fan of poetic, lyrical writing, preferring straight forward and stark prose, so I was already a bit wary of Erin Morgenstern's debut.<br /><br />As promised, THE NIGHT CIRCUS is a story of magic, romance, intrigue, and historical beauty wrapped in gorgeous prose and imagery that marks Morgenstern as a talent to be watched in the future.  The story follows Celia and Marco, two young magicians locked in a battle of magic that will only end when one dies.  Over the course of several decades, we are told of their lives, along with a cast of characters and intertwined stories of love, loss, deceit, and utter beauty.  Morgenstern's talent lies in her indelible use of prose and images, describing in detail scenes of wonder and beauty.<br /><br />Morgenstern's problem in the book is not her writing.  She is highly skilled.  Her imagery is brilliant and thought-provoking.  What I found lacking was plot.  At times the story feels forced, and for the love between Celia and Marco, there was a suddenness to it, almost random in the way that Celia falls for Marco.  At times, the imagery, although breathtaking, overwhelmed the plot, focusing too much on the intricate details of insignificant items and people and too little on the details of the plot, the characters, and the circus itself.  At times, characterization can fall flat, glossed over for the sake of beautiful descriptions.  I wanted to know more about these characters and I felt like I barely knew them by the end of the book.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I really enjoyed this book and I might be one of the few who didn't outright love it.  I would definitely suggest this book to others, and I already have.  My mother is already planning on downloading a Kindle copy and reading it soon, and my best friend has promised to find a copy soon.  And so should you.  It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I've been hard-pressed to find many people who didn't really enjoy it.  You might just fall in love with it.<br /><br />VERDICT: With beautiful prose evoking every sense on every page, THE NIGHT CIRCUS's flaw is the sacrifice of plot for beauty.  But my heavens is it beautiful.up of tea, but I've been hard-pressed to find many people who didn't really enjoy it.  You might just fall in love with it.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I ordered this so called \\"complete saga\\" about a month ago.  Everything is fine with the collection except that it is missing the movie \\"The Empire Strikes back\\" It is nowhere to be found.  Instead, it has in it's place a second blu Ray of special features for episodes I through III.  So much for a \\"complete saga\\"!!!!  I certainly do not need two discs of special features for episodes I through III.  What I need is \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\"!!!  I would like to receive what I pay for!!!!!  Is that too much to ask?  I don't think so!!  Has anyone else experienced a similar situation?
B0053KWDES|5.0|This review is based off the following parameters: Upgrading from Senn HD205's to AKG K242's, and AFTER having tried out the FiiO E5.<br /><br />The E5 to me felt underpowered, and slightly useless. Driving my iPod through a Line Out (The F9 cable) through a third generation ipod nano into the E5 provided mediocre results at best. While the sound was a little warmer, all I could do to change anything was raise and lower the volume of the amp. I was not impressed at all, and decided that if I was going to pay 2x.xx for an amp, I'd might as well jump up an extra forty and make it worthwhile. (Doesn't make sense, does it??)<br /><br />The E11 is slightly ignored by its brother, the E7, which is slightly more versatile. However, I'm primarily using my headphones on my iPod, so I don't need the onboard DAC. If you don't need it either, I'd suggest trying out the E11.<br /><br />The E11 is light, but not so light as to make you question the build quality, which is very solid looking. The black finish gets fingerprints on it easily, and takes some buffing to get rid of, but I could live with that.<br />In the box you will find the unit, cables (power, audio, etc), and a rubber band to strap the unit onto whatever mp3 player you own. (I didn't realize this, so I had ordered a pack separately, which I use instead as I found the included band too loose) Positioning of the bands can be tricky, depending on what style of mp3 player you own. Play around a bit, but you'll probably never be completely satisfied.<br />There is a volume knob that I absolutely love, it's a knurled twist dial that's numbered. This also serves as the power; turn until it clicks, and the unit powers on. Turn in the opposite manner until it clicks again, and it's off. In this way there are no accidental turn-ons, and the aluminum housing, while slightly getting in the way of you adjusting the volume through all the cables entering the ports, will prevent you from accidentally turning the volume super high and rupturing your head.<br /><br />Now the amp comes with the ability to add bass, and change to high or low impedance. I maxed out the settings, tossed on some 350kbs flac's and was immediately blown away by the immediate improvement of clarity over the E5's. The bass booster added more 'umph' into the music without overpowering the higher notes, and each individual element of the song I could discern clearly, singularly.<br /><br />So yes, if you are considering a FiiO amp, I'd grab the E11. If you will be using it with your computer, check out the E7. But by all means, forget the E5, or any of the ones that look like squares.<br /><br />EDIT 1/12/13: [Musings] Still using this amp. It works beautifully. I am currently using them to drive my Etymotics MC5's, however I am planning on upgrading my IEM's to either the Rockit R50, Shure SE215-K, or Etymotic HF5. (While I love my AKG K242's, they're just not possible to travel with.) Battery life still is relatively strong, charges a little slow. Users who plan on doing extensive traveling may benefit from picking up an additional battery, as they are relatively small. Low battery indicator is basically when the music cuts out, and the unit starts 'pulsing' noise at you, as well as the blue LED power indicator flashing in sync with the noise pulse.<br />I have since lost the included band and don't care- the unit has not gotten any scratches on it, and still performs admirably.<br /><br />Eventually I do plan on leaving the entry-level platform of portable amps, but for now I will still say that the E11 is absolutely THE perfect entry-level amp for anyone who harbors a love for music, and serves as a wonderful gift for anyone who is looking to enhance their music tastes. And from what I have seen, the price has done nothing but continue to lower, making it an even better deal.<br /><br />EDIT 2 4/22/14: Time for another update! I now use Bowers & Wilkins P5 headphones (no more AKG's), and am surprised how well thisamp drives the P5. Currently I use Schiit Magni/Modi for my desktop amp needs, but when I'm traveling, the FiiO comes out of the drawer and into my bag. Battery life has not decreased noticeably since purchase (I have had this unit for two years now?) nor has the performance decreased. I no longer use my iPods now, so my mp3 player is my phone (HTC One X using PowerAmp Unlocked). From the phone, the audio is good, rather neutral and clear. The FiiO adds a good level of saturation to the noise, adding move volume and bass (oh my god the bass!) to songs. If you like your music with more umph, I still give this product a thumbs up.amp drives the P5.

This book would get a 5 star rating from me, because it's that good, i hope you thoroughly enjoy this book.

0553801473|1.0|Before reading this I thought that George R.R. Martin depending on the conclusion of the series could in fact be compared to Tolkien. After reading this George Lucas's handling of the Star Wars saga is a better comparison. In fact that comparison does a complete discredit to Lucas's handling and continual tinkering of the Star Wars saga.<br /><br />I purchased the kindle edition at midnight the night it was released and it has taken me this long to force my way through it. I can only take so much before I become so frustrated with his handling of the characters and saga or completely bored in his story telling that I have to give it up for a few weeks before getting the stamina to pick it up again. In the end not much happens. It is a feat in itself to write 1000 pages where nothing really happens. Characters that were interesting become trite, boring, and two dimensional. The new POV's are completely disinteresting and abruptly stop any momentum the book begins to build. After reading this I free I need to make an apology to all of the people over years I told had to read this series.<br /><br />What is the biggest problem with this series? It is apparent that George doesn't have any idea where it is going! If you haven't read the New Yorker article that came out about a half a year ago about George R.R. Martin and the series, do so. After reading that article, attending a talk/book release for Dance with Dragons, and considering the time line of releases it is clear he doesn't know where the story is going. My wife who hasn't read any of the books but read the article and attending the talk/book release came to the same conclusion. Consider this, in 5 years he released the first 3 books which were incredible. It then took him 10 years to release the next 2. It wasn't because he was getting them just right, it is because he has no idea what to right. He threw away about 300-400 pages from Dance and Dragons and redid it.<br /><br />This is evident in his POV's. George has written many primary characters into a dead end. He takes them to a location which has no more story or decides the main action should be taking place somewhere else so those other characters basically get abandoned. Where is Sam and Sansa? Jaime has 1 chapter in 1000 pages while Cersei and Arya each have 2. There is really no need for any of the new POV's George just needs to figure out his story for the remaining of the saga and make sure his characters are in the right place. George wrote about 150 pages of which are essentially the misadventures of Tyrion. He could have done it in 10 pages. It should have been, \\"Tyrion takes a boat to Meereen. The boat gets hit by a storm. Another ship picks up the survivors as slaves which also has Mormont on board and the both get sold outside Meereen.\\" I just saved 140 pointless pages. What about Griff then, who cares about Griff.<br /><br />Midway through this book I thought that perhaps HBO by combining Feast and Dance and then using artistic freedom could perhaps salvage this saga but now being at the end I think it is hopeless. I could care less about any further books in the story nor the HBO series. If I'm HBO I'd be worried. If they attempt to follow these last 2 book no one will be watching the show by the end of the fifth season. It would take a heck of a turn around to redeem the series.

B000002I53|5.0|Perhaps the closest analogue this record has in modern-day pop is Radiohead's OK Computer. Like that album, John Coltrane's My Favorite Things was both a commercial success and artistic leap forward.<br /><br />Recorded in just a few days in 1960 (though not released until the following year), My Favorite Things was Trane's breakthrough as a leader. He simultaneously established the core of his great '60s quartet (with pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones), defined a signature sound (lengthy, articulate solos and his trademark soprano sax work) and also notched a radio hit with an edited version of the title track.<br /><br />Gallons of ink have been spilled extolling the importance of this record in the evolution of Coltrane's career and the development of modal jazz. It's melodic, accessible nature makes it one of the most popular post-bop records and many people's introduction to both Coltrane and modern jazz.

B005C5A66G|4.0|Since the release of [[ASIN:B0000D96NW Through the Ashes of Empires]], Machine Head's been driving full speed into their niche of melodic thrash metal that won back the fans who felt alienated by their foray into rap-metal in addition to earning a few new fans who were hip to their new sound.  2007's [[ASIN:B000N3ST9I The Blackening]] set the bar pretty high for this album and while this album isn't as spectacular, it is pretty legitimate in it's own right and worth picking up.<br /><br />Continuing on their \\"working man's progressive thrash metal\\" formula they've been dishing out since TTAOE, none of the tracks are under the 5:30 minute mark, with most being around 6 or so minutes.  I wish the album was as long as it's predecessor (despite the song lengths, the album itself is under 50 minutes, which is kinda a downer) but the time used is used well.  \\"I Am Hell\\" shows off the band writing three songs as one (something they've not attempted before) and gives the listener with that progressive metal feel.  Then you go onto their title track, which delivers the thrash along with some fantastic solo work.  \\"This Is The End\\" focuses more on vocals than the other tracks while \\"Who We Are\\" gives the album the send off similar to what \\"A Farewell To Arms\\" sent The Blackening off with.  All and all, the songs are unmistakeably Machine Head and captures the sound that many imitate, but only they do right.<br /><br />My question is can they do this live or will they be relying heavily on their back catalog for live shows?  For as great as this record sounded, there was a lot about the drums and vocals that sounded very \\"studioized.\\"  That's legitimate for sales, but kinda stinks if you're hoping to have the same experience live.  Nevertheless, the title track sounded well when performed over this past summer's Rockstar Mayhem Festival tour, so I'm cautiously optimistic.<br /><br />This is recommended for all Machine Head fans, in addition to fans of metal or hard rock.<br /><br />** UPDATE 02/27/2012 ** I saw them live in LA a week and a half ago and yeah, they were excellent live.  Good to see them pull that off!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Does more than I expected. U.I. Is amazing. Also very simple to use. Free or paid, great app. Great job dev
B004G25V9S|4.0|No two Opeth records will ever be the same.  Does [[ASIN:B00009W8N2 Orchid]] sound like [[ASIN:B000AADYYO Ghost Reveries]]?  Does [[ASIN:B0000584V3 Blackwater Park]] sound like [[ASIN:B0000E1WMJ My Arms, Your Hearse]]?  No.  And you know what, that's part of what makes this band what it is.    On Opeth's prior album, [[ASIN:B0018CWWFK Watershed]], the band was blasting and riffing away for most of the album (kinda like Blackwater Park and [[ASIN:B00006SFBD Deliverance]]) so fans had to expect Mikael Akerfeldt to reign in his progressive fusion-tendencies for this record (similar to [[ASIN:B00008OLYN Damnation]]).  Now, this record isn't anywhere near as passive as Damnation is, but it definitely isn't one of Opeth's heavier releases.  Just the same, it doesn't mean it should be ignored, either.  The band doesn't bring it's usual element of metal for this round.  Instead, the band sounds more rock driven, kinda like they found some old equipment and started rocking out... that is, when they aren't experimenting with delicate and easy listening fusion. A good example of this is \\"Nepenthe\\", one minute, the bands all getting their [[ASIN:B00006GO9Q In a Silent Way]] on and in the next, they're busting out licks that would be [[ASIN:B000001Y5P Les Claypool]] approved for funkiness.  A lot of this record goes in a land between the land of heavy driven old school prog rock, jazz/funk fusion, and the classical guitar-meets-modern sound that was frequently showcased on Damnation.  Hell, \\"Famine\\" had a flutist on it; not since Jethro Tull has a flute been near anything affiliated with heavy metal!  A few of the songs are in excess of 8 minutes, but most hover around the 4-6 minute mark, which is pretty short by Opeth's standards.  I'm surprised that they put out this kinda record while being signed to Roadrunner.  Maybe the label needed the money and wanted something more commercial sounding; who knows.  All I have to say is that fans who felt alienated by how heavy Watershedwas have reason to love the band again.  And for all you headbangers out there who're mad that Mikael Akerfeldt isn't growling on this one... diversify.
B00008K7AM|1.0|Shipping for this item was fast and the price was good. However when I actually watched it, it was so badly scratched in certain parts that I had to skip ahead. So basically I can't watch it all the way through. I thought it was used but still in decent condition, not so. Very disappointing.
B005DKLPF6|4.0|Yeah they don't scream as much as they used to.  Get over it.  For anyone expecting this to be another [[ASIN:B001R4MEYI Crack the Skye]], prepare to be shocked.  This actually shares more in the kindred spirits of [[ASIN:B0000DDAU9 Remission]], [[ASIN:B0002N66FS Leviathan]], and [[ASIN:B000GPI2EK Blood Mountain]] than it does in their last effort.  Yeah, the vocals are more melodic, and they haven't completely abandoned the prog concept they showcased on Crack The Skye.  But the album sounds like Mastodon as a band than it does as it's own concept album.  Heck, the opening of \\"Black Tongue\\" reminded of \\"Crusher Destroyer\\" for a minute before it went on to rock out.  But yeah, you hear the banjo-influenced riffing on top of Brann Daillor's chaotic druming with the spooky harmonic vocals that they've come to be known for.  The album closes with an instrumental track \\"The Sparrow\\", harkening back to their previous works.  There's no detours here, just a reminder of what these guys have accomplished and who they are.  The songs here are decent, a few of them should be straight-up radio hits.  Seriously, if you aren't throwing up the horns to \\"Curl Of The Burl,\\" you need to either check yourself for a pulse or need to stop taking life so seriously!  The song lengths are more inline with their earlier releases (2-5 minutes) but they still have a deep album, clocking in at just under 54 minutes.  Personal favorite track is \\"All The Heavy Lifting\\" but there's a lot to draw from here and a great album to listen to from start to finish.  I recommend it to all Mastodon fans, in addition to metal and rock fans who want to hear something new that they can show off to people who should know better.
0517548232|3.0|I haven't finished book, but I perceived it is written years and years ago, does it fit the global eco circumstance ?  And the expression is not straightforward, but I'll keep going, from all aspects to get an idea how people understand economy.  Thank you.
B000008H4E|5.0|This is one of the all time best albums.  I had the vinyl lp and over the years lost it . Also turntable quit working . So like so many of my favorites this one had to be re-acquired. A must have. Tried to find it for years.  Thanks to Amazon I once again have it.  Awesome !!!!
B005RUS7LC|3.0|***SPOILER ALERT****  This is new plot twist doesn't make sense to me and I hope it is not what it seems.  Jessie even said it himself that he had the cigarette in the morning so how are you going to blame someone that wasn't even there at the facility(Mr. White) or Saul (even more far fetched).  So Gus, who has been highly intelligent, calculating, and who plans out every move ahead of time, is going to use the cigarette's poison, knowing there was no way Mr. White had access to it, in the hope that Jessie fingers Mr. White instead of him? Just seems like a wild shot in the dark plan that is uncharacteristic of Gus.  But the writers of the show made it play out that way anyway making Jessie look like a tool, he is but not that bad. Because the plot twist didn't make any sense, the whole confrontation between Jessie and Mr. White seemed out of place, even forced, to further a somewhat new direction in the show; them teaming up again.  The very last scene of the episode left me open to the idea that maybe what happened is not what it appears to be.  We the audience don't know what really happened to Brock, we only have Mr. White's conclusion of what happened...  TL;DR  The story to this episode didn't make any sense and I'll give it 5 stars if turns out differently.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|This has to be at least the third, if not the fourth version of this movie . However it flashes back several times. It's as if the makers of this movie said to themselves \\"how can we make it different this time\\" . Well I don,t enjoy \\"flashbacks\\" in a movie, it sort of ruins the flow of things. It makes it a little too 'artsy-fartsy for my tastes...That being said it was still well worth seeing.

B0036TGSR6|2.0|Five years after the faithful but bland adaption of \\"Oliver Twist,\\" Roman Polanski came back with a political thriller \\"The Ghost Writer.\\" Reading the positive reviews and praises heaped upon the film, some quoting the name of Hitchcock, my expectation was high. Now I saw the film, and I don't know what to say. Acting is mostly effective, and so is the dark photography. But I am afraid that Polanski takes the preposterous storyline too seriously.  Polanski's political thriller is about a British ghost writer played by Ewan McGregor, who takes over the job of writing memoirs of former UK Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) when his predecessor was found dead on the beach. The unnamed protagonist flies to Martha's Vineyard, where Lang, being accused of a war crime, has been staying with his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) and his assistant Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall). While working on the project, the ghost writer stumbles upon possible clues that might suggest foul play.  It's not a bad opening, and the film's gloomy atmosphere is something you shouldn't miss, but the convoluted storyline has so many plot holes. The stories of Hitchcock's thrillers were often contrived, but at least they tried to stay within the bounds of plausibility. If the titular ghost writer really believes the \\"secret\\" he finds, (helped by several lucky coincidences and Google), and tells the whole world about it, who would believe it? Do you?   Of course, some might argue the film is not just about suspense. It can be, say, meditation on the elusiveness of truth. But when the \\"truth\\" is something too incredible, why should we take the film seriously. Strangely, however, that is exactly what \\"The Ghost Writer\\" wants us to, with its very political aspects which I don't discuss here. Whatever the film is, it is slick and stylish. I wish that Polanski had used his styles for materials that really deserve them.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm a first-generation Star Wars fan since 1977, having seen the original versions of the original three films in the theater one time each as a child, then falling in love with them all over again on VHS in 1987. And I've been a huge fan ever since. The Star Wars Saga is the ultimate epic space opera and film series.<br /><br />This isn't actually a review of the movies most of you reading this will have seen one or more versions of dozens of times (well, at least the classic trilogy), although this review will discuss some of the changes made (and not made) to all the films. This is meant to be an overview of the 9-disc 2011 blu-ray product entitled \\"Star Wars: The Complete Saga\\" with personal observations and select commentary thrown in.<br /><br />PHYSICAL QUALITIES<br /><br />Disc & Packaging Structure<br /><br />The discs themselves are heavy-duty, yet smooth and well-coated with scratch resistance - the best available in retail products I've seen. The packaging is also of superior physical construction, taking the form of a hardback book with 9 sturdy pages (think baby/toddler cardboard book stiffness), and the book has an outer box it slides in and out of. The disc-book is about a centimeter shorter than a standard DVD case and slightly wider. Each right-side page is half-circle open in the middle, forming a sleeve with a super-smoothly-coated insides for the optimum protection for both storing and removing/returning the discs. The inside back cover has a more traditional sleeve for the set's single information booklet called \\"Guide to the Galaxy\\" which mostly details the special features on the bonus discs. For those of you with \\"green\\" consciousness, there is not a single sliver of hard plastic anywhere in the box/book - the only plastic in the entire product is in the discs themselves and I suspect the very thin, soft coating of the inner disc sleeves. I couldn't really have even imagined higher-quality discs and a better-constructed storage for my Star Wars blu-ray set. I'm very pleased with this aspect of it.<br /><br />Disc & Packaging Appearance<br /><br />Of lesser concern for me is the appearance of the product's physical components, but for sake of completeness, I'll mention it. The discs themselves do not have any images - they are light grey with blue trimmings. The movie discs (1-6) have the previously used logos of STAR WARS with the episode subtitle underneath, both on top of the episode number in the form of a large Roman numeral. The outer box and disc-book do not have a single photo - it is entirely original artwork. The info booklet has the single photo of the entire product (the Falcon flying through Death Star II), and more artwork. In my opinion, the artwork almost totally sucks. It's awful! The spine, front and back covers of the disc-book exactly match the box, which is also used for the cover of the info-booklet. The disc-book has 10 two-page images (minus half-a-disc-sized portion for the disc on the right-page of the 9 pages). The only tolerable movie disc image is for Episode II, but that is because the characters are more distant and the image has the most photo-realism to it. The only art I really like in the entire product is a small picture of Luke on a Taun Taun in the info booklet, and the disc book picture for Bonus Disc 1 (certainly by a different, better artist), although it depicts something that does not occur in the films or even deleted scenes: Boba Fett is riding a lizard mount like Obi-Wan rode on Utapau in Episode III. I think that picture may be a nod to the animated sequence of the old Star Wars Holiday Special in which Boba Fett rides a creature of some kind, IIRC.<br /><br />I am somewhat disappointed that they didn't just use photographic imagery throughout this entire product like some of the other releases because that would have been more attractive. Or they could have at least just gotten a better artist for the art throughout the entire product! But like I said, more important than the product's appearance to me is the structural qualities of the discs and packaging, and of course the digital disc content.<br /><br />THE BONUS DISCS<br /><br />The films are much more important than anything else, but for completeness I'll touch on the special features discs.<br /><br />Bonus Discs 1 & 2<br /><br />Bonus Disc 1 is devoted to the prequels while Disc 2 is for the classic trilogy. Bonus Discs 1 & 2 have archive cast & crew interviews, 360° turnaround galleries for props and costumes, art galleries, and a total of 45 deleted/extended scenes exclusive to this release. I've watched all the deleted/extended scenes for all 6 films, and the most interesting ones to me were for Return of the Jedi, especially the Battle of Endor stuff. But there was nothing that I thought really shouldn't have been cut from the films.<br /><br />I've read some complaints about the menu organization of these first two bonus discs. First you choose the movie you want to access the features for, and then within each episode choice the features are divided up by planets/settings (Naboo, Tatooine and Coruscant for Episode I; Tatooine, Aboard the Death Star, and The Battle of Yavin for Episode IV; etc.). So when I went through to watch all deleted/extended scenes, I had to keep going up and down an extra menu level to get to the scenes for the next setting, and then up and down two level menu levels to move on to the next film. It is a little wacky but really just a minor inconvenience if you want to only view one specific type of feature for 1 or all 3 films on each disc. If you want to watch everything in one setting of one film at a time, then the menu tree is set up specifically for maximum convenience in that case.<br /><br />And I just remembered that I read somewhere that Bonus Disc 2 has the animated sequence of the Star Wars Holiday Special. It is not listed as a special feature on the info booklet, but if you navigate through a certain menu you'll supposedly find it.<br /><br />Bonus Disc 3<br /><br />Bonus Disc 3 has documentaries not available on the Star Wars DVDs. As a whole they cover the entire saga, but the main focus is on the classic trilogy. They are not nearly as important to me as they are to a lot of fans I know, but I can speak on a few of them. I'm sure I was totally enthralled by The Making of Star Wars (1977) on TV when I was a kid, and someday when I'm feeling nostalgic for my childhood I'll probably watch that again. I used to have Classic Creatures (1983 - hosted by Carrie Fisher and Billy Dee Williams) on VHS, and it is interesting if you want a behind-the-scenes look at the aliens from Return of the Jedi, including the operation of the 6-man Jabba muppet. I had taped the excellent Star Wars Tech (2007) onto a blank VHS, so it's cool that I now have it in a digital format, but it's disappointing that this disc didn't include History Channel's also excellent Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed (so I`ll have to keep that tape).<br /><br />The only documentary that I've watched on this blu-ray so far is the new Star Wars Spoofs (2011), a 97-minute compilation of Star Wars spoofs and parodies from 1977 to the present. There are entire short skits (like the classic 1977 SNL Star Wars Lounge Singer Bill Murray, and the hilarious Natalie Portman SNL monologue). There are a multitude of clips from various TV episodes and movies (The Simpsons, Family Guy, That 70's Show, Robot Chicken, Fanboys, etc.). They even had Weird All Yankovic's \\"The Saga Begins\\" music video. There is some great stuff and not-so-great stuff. There is so much there but a few things missing that should be there. The down side of this feature is, there isn't a chapter division for each individual clip so if you want to skip the one your on or repeat one, you'll jump father away or have to scan ahead or back - a minor inconvenience. It's a long feature that I watched at night and I started getting sleepy by the end, so you may not want to watch it all in one setting like I did. Being a blu-ray, you can bookmark it anywhere though.)<br /><br />THE FILM DISCS<br /><br />This is as good a place as any to mention that there are two audio commentary tracks for each of the films of blu-ray. There are the same ones from the previous DVD versions of these films, and then new commentaries compiled from \\"archival interviews with cast and crew\\". For the classic trilogy, I would expect that the word \\"archival\\" to mean pre-1997, which should be a real treat for all the purists. I don't enjoy listening to commentaries while watching adventure films, but I will force myself to listen to the new tracks once (as I did for the original DVD commentaries).<br /><br />As I have only had one frame of reference for viewing the blu-ray films, I thought I should first specify what that is, in case my experiences are in any way relative to my equipment and viewing conditions. This may mean more to you than it does to me. My blu-ray player is a Sony BDP-S350. My HD TV is a Sony Bravia KDL-40V4100, a flat-screen LCD with a diagonal of a little over a meter. My blu-ray player and TV are both almost 3 years old. My line of vision is exactly 90° to the plane of the TV screen, and my eyes and ears are at a height equal to about 1/3 up from the bottom edge of the screen. I'm sitting such that the distance of my head to the TV screen is a little more than the width of the Death Star's thermal exhaust port.<br /><br />The Films on Blu-ray<br /><br />All six films sound and look awesome in HD! Even Revenge of the Sith, which had the least room for improvement, is substantially better. I fully appreciate all the pain-staking effort that had to go into improving the resolution of over 12 hours of high-quality sci-fi entertainment, frame-by-frame. Coruscant from space is breathtakingly gorgeous. The Millennium Falcon is amazingly detailed, with all of it's charming dents and carbon-scoring. The Death Stars seem even bigger and more epic due to the incredible level of detail now visible. I could go on and on, but you're really just going to have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />There is one significant exception in the HD upgrade. A very logical and fitting artistic choice was made in the rendering of the holograms of characters. Throughout the all six movies, it looks like the holograms were not upgraded to HD, now looking somewhat pixilated compared to the surrounding \\"reality\\" they are projected into. This of course is easily explained in-universe as they are just not high-resolution transmissions, and I feel this actually works to improve the illusion of the entire scene seeming real. The holograms are now an intentional vestige of the analogue age, left behind to honor the origin and evolution of the Star Wars films themselves which began as motion picture projections but have now become the ultra-realistic-looking digital media. A very nice touch. And the hologram effects also seems more unified between the two trilogies now.<br /><br />A significant improvement that the HD upgrade also provides is a solution to a common criticism I have ran into since 1997. Over the years I have heard many Star Wars fans express that the addition of GC characters and objects into the films seems unrealistic, in not only the updated versions of the classic trilogy but even the prequels. Ironically, these fans seem to have no trouble accepting the un-reality of rubber muppet characters, but CG is somehow unacceptable in their vision of the Star Wars universe. Well, now muppets, rubber masks, human actors and CG characters can all exist in visual harmony together, thanks to the wonders of HD. The increase in resolution seems to have unified the apparent realities of them all. Now the real-world elements of the scenes have been \\"raised\\" to the same level of visual reality of the CG elements, resulting in the CG elements seeming to much more naturally blend in with their surroundings. This is more apparentin the classic films, but applies to the prequels as well. This adds in a whole new level of visual realism to the films, perhaps being the greatest achievement of these new blu-ray versions of the films.<br /><br />Now I'll go into more detail about some of the blu-ray enhancements and changes specific to each film.<br /><br />Episode I: The Phantom Menace<br /><br />The effect for the Jedi Knights speeding away from the droidekas on the Trade Federation ship has been improved. The original effects error of the two-headed pod race announcer's hand passing through his vest was fixed.<br /><br />The big change that even the die hard purists don't seem to mind so much is the complete and utter removal of that awful imitation Yoda muppet. The TPM muppet bore a vague resemblance to the original muppet from the sequels, but I thought that the TMP muppet could at most pass for Yoda's crazy spice-addicted brother. I know some fans that feel the CG Yoda model from AotC and RotS was not as good as the original muppet, but even they would agree that the prequel CG model looks a lot more like the original muppet than the TMP muppet did. And in blu-ray the CG Yoda in all 3 prequels looks more realistic now, so I'm very happy with this change.<br /><br />Episodes II & III (Attack of the Clones & Revenge of the Sith)<br /><br />These mostly only had minute editorial tweaks like the exact transition between scenes, moving a couple reaction shots and dialogue lines to a slightly different part of a scene. The only really somewhat significant change is adding a line of dialogue in AotC where Anakin is having a nightmare about his mother while staying on Naboo. Shmi Skywalker's voice is now heard pleading for Anakin's help with the echo effect (signifying it is a thought or dream in Anakin's mind). It does accomplish the addition of a little more urgency to the drama of the film.<br /><br />The Classic Trilogy<br /><br />Above, I mentioned how great the Death Stars and the Falcon look. The asteroid field effects are improved all the way around, and Cloud City looks fantastic. The upgrade to high definition is more noticeable in the original trilogy and thus strikes me as even more stunning overall. For the most part, the lightsaber effects are improved and match the prequel effects.<br /><br />However, there are some aspects of some scenes that you can only do so much with without completely new effects. The squares around the ships flying in front of outer space are no longer visible, but ships flying in front a capital ship still sometimes show a barely noticeable amount of distortion surrounding the smaller ship. The snowspeeder cockpits viewed from the pilot's point of view are now completely opaque against the Hoth landscape, but you can still just barely see the moon of Endor through Han's head and the cockpit of the shuttle Tyderium. And some distance backgrounds that were previously just out-of-focus in the original camerawork are now just understandably flat-out blurry in HD.<br /><br />Episode IV: A New Hope<br /><br />Obi-Wan's simulated Krayt Dragon roar (to scare off the Tusken Raiders that had attacked Luke) has been changed yet again. While I don't understand Lucas' need to change it, I also don't understand the big uproar this insignificant alteration to the film has caused among fans. A live Krayt Dragon is never seen onscreen anywhere in the film saga. Who's to say what a fictional off-screen animal should sound like? I would think Lucas is the only one that would even care. I certainly don't give a damn what the dragon is supposed to sound like. The fictional simulation of a never-seen creature's roar only has to convince the fictional Sand People, not us. You may not like a particular sound effect, but I think the harsh criticisms I have read about this (for any version of the roar) for something so inconsequential are ridiculous.<br /><br />Rocks have been added near the opening of the little cave that R2 is hiding in whenObi-Wan shows up, and the negative criticisms to this are completely unfounded. It has been spread throughout the internet that the rocks inexplicably \\"disappear\\" when R2 is later shown wheeling towards Obi-Wan and Luke, but the purists that have stated this are totally misinterpreting the scene. When R2 is coming out of hiding, the shot is from a different angle than the previous view into the cave, and the rocks that had been added to the previous shot would be behind R2 who is obscuring the mouth of the cave. So how are you supposed to see the added rocks through R2? There is no discontinuity caused by the added rocks, and I suspect that some purists are misreporting things in an attempt to fuel the fire of their hatred of Lucas and all changes in general.<br /><br />I mean, there nothing wrong with not liking the new rocks, but it is incorrect to misrepresent the continuity of the film. I don't really like the added rocks but I don't dislike them either, because it really has no impact on the scene, just like the variations of Obi-Wan's dragon roars. The details of these two changes are just go in my \\"Whatever, George\\" file and are then given no more attention. And some people say Lucas is all OCD about Star Wars!<br /><br />The scene where Luke first turns on his father's lightsaber has been edited more tightly to better conceal the disjointedness that occurred from the original editing of two different takes together to appear as one continuous live action. I'm pleased with that minor but needed improvement.<br /><br />And now Han and Greedo shoot at virtually the same time.<br /><br />The Sequels<br /><br />While holograms have been left in a lower resolution, the Force Ghosts have been fully upgraded to HD further differentiating between the two effects. Both sequels overall look great, but almost all the changes were made to RotJ. For the purist muppet-lovers out there, rest easy. Yoda and Jabba the Hutt remain the original muppets they've always been in the sequels, but even the muppets look better in HD. And I'll throw in here that contrary to false rumors, Sebastian Shaw's portrayal of Anakin de-masked remains unchanged from the previous version of the film (besides the upgrade of it to HD).<br /><br />Episode VI: Return of the Jedi<br /><br />The static shot of the droids moving up to the blast door to Jabba's palace is now slightly expanded into a wide pan-in to the droids starting with a larger door. It adds heightened impression of scale to the beginning of this space opera adventure - a nice touch.<br /><br />The \\"thawing out\\" of Han has been slightly altered so the carbonite seems more like it's \\"melting\\" away, an improvement to the original effect.<br /><br />A Dug (the species of Sebulba in TPM) is added walking in an empty space in one shot in the palace (not a close-up), and some people say it looks fake. I think it looks better than a lot of the rubber aliens in the palace, and I like it how the Dug adds a little more visual continuity between the two trilogies.<br /><br />A few shots of Ewoks show them blinking, and a couple close-ups of Wicket show the details of his eyes, making Ewoks seem more like real animal life-forms and less like midgets in suites.<br /><br />It does seem like a few TIE Fighters were added to the Battle of Endor, another improvement made in the interest of increasing the sense of epic scale.<br /><br />When R2 is blasted in front of the shield generator bunker, I noticed that the electricity effects were enhanced. My wife noticed that they added some gadgets popping out of R2. I'll watch for that next time, but since I didn't even notice the new gadgets I doubt I will have any problem with the change.<br /><br />\\"No... Nooo!\\"<br /><br />When Vader is watching Luke getting zapped by the final attack of the Emperor's Sith lightning, Anakin now says \\"No.\\" Then as he picks up Palpatine, Anakin more loudly says, \\"Nooo!\\" I've read this described as a \\"scream\\" but that is way overstating it. And contrary to what is commonly being reported, it is also not quite the extended \\"Noooo!\\" from RotS when Vader finds out that Padme is dead. (That may have been the recording they used as a basis, but if so it was augmented and shortened for this scene in RotJ.)<br /><br />When looking at the complete Star Wars saga, these two additions of the word \\"No\\" do not seem out of place to me at all. Obi-Wan yelled, \\"Noooo!\\" when he saw his Jedi master get struck down by Darth Maul in Episode I. Luke yelled, \\"Nooo!\\" when he saw Vader strike down Obi-Wan in Episode IV. Luke has his mega-no sequence to Vader in Episode V, \\"No... No! That's not true. That's impossible! ... Noooooo! Noo!\\" It seems that now Anakin in Episode VI is just following in a time-honored tradition among his master and son. But at the climax of the six-film saga, it's stated at the prevention of the negative outcome. This broken man who had killed his wife and Jedi master was now sacrificing his life to save their son and destroy the Sith master. My wife, who had made it a game when watching the blu-rays to point out every change to the films she noticed, made no mention of Anakin's new No's. It seemed so natural and appropriate to her that after seeing the blu-ray once, she thought they had always been there. Anakin's new No's make perfect sense to me with respect to the entire film saga.<br /><br />I have read criticisms that the new No's were out-of-character for Vader. Well, it is not Vader who said them! It was the buried persona of Anakin Skywalker who was emerging back to the surface to conquer Darth Vader. The titular Jedi who was at that moment returning. I like Anakin's new No's!<br /><br />STILL UNCORRECTED...<br /><br />I've long ago accepted the fact that I am a severe minority among first generation Star Wars fans. Many of the fans from our generation like to point out things they would change about the prequels or changes to the original trilogy they don`t like. So now that the films are all so close to perfection, I thought I would represent a radical view by going \\"anti-purist\\" and provide my fan-boy list of things in the classic trilogy that in my opinion still need changed or corrected!<br /><br />Episode IV: A New Hope<br /><br />After the droids land on Tatooine, the inside of the escape pod's open hatch that was previously blue is now a slightly more realistic-looking black in the blu-ray. But later when the stormtroopers search the area, the hatch is still blue. What, it is a black material than turns blue under the hot suns? This is minor point but just seems unfinished.<br /><br />Lucas has long stated that the cantina scene was incomplete in the original release. He ran out of time and money to finish it. By now he's had decades, no shortage of money, and obviously no qualms about revising his movies. But one of the two Duros has long alien fingers while the other still has normal human hands. A little CG fix in a dim background, come on!<br /><br />And in blu-ray it is now more than ever apparent that when Ponda Baba (walrus man) is shown at the bar he has fin-cup hands, instead of the more humanoid hand of the severed arm shown on the floor after Obi-Wan slices it off. The ANH deleted scenes even have the original shot of the severed fin-cup hand on the floor. Changing it to more humanoid hand in post-production for the original release was a completely sensible decision because without a humanoid hand it wasn't very clear what was on the floor. But now, with all this financial success and time, Lucas couldn't just go ahead and fix the previous shots of the alien to also have the five-fingered hands? A couple minor CG fixes, come on!<br /><br />Also, I really don't see the need for all that blood on the floor by the severed arm. Putting the humanoid hand with a gun makes it pretty clear what Obi-Wan had cut off. All the other cases of limbs and heads getting chopped off by lightsabers throughout the rest of the film saga do not show any blood (in fact the severed body parts sometimes also conveniently disappear from view).<br /><br />In 1976, the remote-control R2 was unreliable and often failed. So they improvised in some shots where only the top of R2 is visible by having the live actor that played him just hobble along with his own legs, which resulted in R2 appearing to bob up and down while traveling over a flat surface the character would be rolling across in-universe. Even as a kid I thought that looked ridiculous because R2 just shouldn't move that way. On blu-ray, the CG R2 in the prequels looks virtually identical to the live ones in the entire saga, so there is really no reason that they couldn't have just corrected the bobbing R2 shots to one moving in a manner consistent with all the other scenes he is shown rolling in.<br /><br />An often pointed out effects problem is the appearance of Skywalker's lightsaber blade on the Falcon. The fix the blu-ray applied appeared inconsistent in my viewing. Sometimes it looked consistent with the saber blade's appearance in RotS and TESB, bold and bluish. But other times it still appears weak and turquoise-tinted. Why only fix some of the scene and not all?<br /><br />In TESB blu-ray, it looks like R2's blue parts that originally appeared black while in Luke's X-wing have finally been made blue. But in ANH's Battle of Yavin, there are still shots of R2's blue parts being black. That should have been cake to fix them all by now.<br /><br />I'm a huge film score music aficionado. TESB's iconic \\"Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)\\" was based on the \\"Imperial Attack\\" theme from ANH. There was no longer a need for the original \\"Imperial Attack\\" so it never appeared in the saga outside of ANH. \\"Imperial March\\" was used in the subsequent five Star Wars films as appropriate. When the saga is viewed chronologically, the theme appearing significantly in the films taking place before and after ANH makes ANH seem somewhat at a loss without it. I feel it would be appropriate to edit brief phrases of \\"Imperial March\\" into ANH in two places: When Vader first appears in the film as he enters Leia's starship, and when Vader last appears in the film as he gains control of his TIE fighter and flies away. Thematically, that would make a lot of sense without altering the musical landscape of ANH as a whole.<br /><br />Episodes V: The Empire Strikes Back<br /><br />It makes perfect sense for walker vehicle motion to be produced with the use of stop-motion photography. Intuitively, machines moving in that non-organic fashion seems realistic. But I have always had a problem with the effect of tauntauns' moving. I do understand that in 1979, claymation was the only way to bring tauntaun's to life, but the choppy motion looks incredibly fake by today's standards, especially on blu-ray. I still have no problem with the muppet Taun-Tauns used for the close-ups, but for a couple distant shots they should have CGed the tauntaun scenes.<br /><br />It seems to me that the scene where Han rescues Luke on Hoth uses a little short-cut in the upgrade to HD. The scene is now darker, which of course means less detail is needed. It actually makes the scene more dramatic because it visually supports Han's dialogue about it getting dark and there not being much time to get the shelter built to save them both from the cold Hoth night. But there is one shot of Luke laying down in the snow by the dead tauntaun in which the brightest seems to suddenly change. Is this a glitch from viewing it on my equipment, or a flaw in the blu-ray itself?<br /><br />And in the modern age of ILM, there is no longer any need to depend on the 1979 live-action short sleeve/long sleeve \\"effect\\" to portray Luke with his hand cut off. Just fix his really long-looking arm with CG.<br /><br />And as great as most of the lightsaber battle looks, Vader's lightsaber still comes across as hot pink in a couple shots. So the blu-rays almost got all the lightsaber shots fixed in the classic trilogy. And at the end of TESB when Luke, Leia and the droids are watching the Falcon fly away, R2's blue parts are still black.<br /><br />Episodes VI: Return of the Jedi<br /><br />Like almost everything on the Star Wars blu-rays the surface of the rancor's body looks impressive, but I'm still not happy with outcome of the effect of slowing down the footage to make the creature seem larger. Just like in my childhood, the rancor still moves too slow-mo to really seem that menacing to me. But since speeding up the footage would only make the creature seem smaller, the only way to really improve the effect in this manner would be to start over with a CG rancor. They'd need to either re-edit some of that scene visually to have extra faster movements to pace with the current music, or to just have the faster scene have a shorter overall runtime and edit out some of the musical score. I'd prefer the former over the latter.<br /><br />When Yoda dies, the blu-ray still uses the archaic original effect of Yoda's blanket fading out with Yoda, while at the same time the blanket without Yoda can be seen fading in (but not exactly the same position) before it falls into the vacuum left by Yoda's passing. So for a time, two blankets are visible as Yoda fades away. It should now be easy to fix this transition by simply adding a CG blanket over both of the original blankets, with the CG blanket falling down not unlike the original one did after Yoda is completely gone from the shot.<br /><br />The prequels expand upon and enhance the meaning of the classic films. In Episode I, John Williams introduced a new musical theme based on \\"Imperial March\\" called \\"Anakin's Theme\\", a softer, lighter theme which is used throughout the prequels. With respect to the entire film saga, it would be thematically appropriate to briefly quote Anakin's theme when Anakin dies and into Luke's reaction shot.<br /><br />Editing a brief quote of the epic prequel musical theme called \\"Duel of the Fates\\" somewhere into the final confrontation of Jedi vs. Sith would also thematically unify the saga. The prequels make good use of the classic musical themes, while also evolving them into new themes, so a couple minute additions of prequel themes into the RotJ's soundtrack could enhance the cohesion of the saga as a whole.<br /><br />Although it does not appear as much as the Luke's \\"long-sleeve\\" severed arm in TESB, a similar live-action \\"effect\\" was used for Vader/Anakin when Luke cut off his hand. This is more visible when in the close-up on Anakin after he throws Palpatine into the pit, the forearm that bends like it has a wrist in the middle of it (because in the real world, it does). But Anakin is a cyborg so maybe his forearm also got broken inside the leather suit? OK, fine. But it really stands-out when Luke is dragging Anakin to the shuttle by one hand and one bent forearm that happens to appear just as long as the arm that had the hand cut off. CG it!<br /><br />Future Revisions to the Films?<br /><br />Based on Lucas' pattern since 1997, the classic films get changed every 7 years so that alone would indicate that we have another revision to the saga coming by 2018. However, it has been all 6 films will be re-released theatrically in 3D one-at-a-time starting with Episode I in February 2012. If the 3D films come out at the rate of one per year, the final episode will come out in 2017 which is also the 40th anniversary of the original Star Wars film. It seems extremely likely that the films will be re-released in a home 3D format either one-at-a-time or all at once by 2017. Either way I suspect that I'll need a 3D TV by 2017). There is plenty of time to put further revisions into the rest of the films, especially the classic trilogy. I'd be thrilled if they revised anything from my \\"still uncorrected\\" list above! Lucas won't live forever so I doubt there will be any new versions of the films after the home 3D versions. So when will Lucas stoprevising his films? My guess is 2017.<br /><br />FINAL WORDS<br /><br />You may not agree with all the opinions I expressed throughout this review, but if you are reading this then you must be a Star Wars fan of some kind on some level. If so, then do yourself a favor and watch all six films on blu-ray at least once, even if you have no intention of ever owning them. You'll see much more than I could possibly ever hope to describe in words. And if you wish to criticize the blu-ray versions after viewing them, at least you'll then have an educated opinion for doing so.<br /><br />In my first viewing of Star Wars: The Complete Saga, the rich Star Wars multiverse has deepened in a way I couldn't have even imagined before seeing the films on blu-ray. While still not perfect, my favorite films have just gotten an incredible amount better. As impossible as it previously seemed, I'm somehow now even more of a Star Wars fan than I was before. But this blu-ray release has also reminded me that EVERY version of any Star Wars film is awesome!<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free the ask. If you have also seen the blu-rays and want to comment on them with respect to my review, please also feel free. May the Force be with you.the droids starting with a larger door. It adds heightened impression of scale to the beginning of this space opera adventure - a nice touch.  The \\"thawing out\\" of Han has been slightly altered so the carbonite seems more like it's \\"melting\\" away, an improvement to the original effect.  A Dug (the species of Sebulba in TPM) is added walking in an empty space in one shot in the palace (not a close-up), and some people say it looks fake. I think it looks better than a lot of the rubber aliens in the palace, and I like it how the Dug adds a little more visual continuity between the two trilogies.  A few shots of Ewoks show them blinking, and a couple close-ups of Wicket show the details of his eyes, making Ewoks seem more like real animal life-forms and less like midgets in suites.  It does seem like a few TIE Fighters were added to the Battle of Endor, another improvement made in the interest of increasing the sense of epic scale.  When R2 is blasted in front of the shield generator bunker, I noticed that the electricity effects were enhanced. My wife noticed that they added some gadgets popping out of R2. I'll watch for that next time, but since I didn't even notice the new gadgets I doubt I will have any problem with the change.  \\"No... Nooo!\\"  When Vader is watching Luke getting zapped by the final attack of the Emperor's Sith lightning, Anakin now says \\"No.\\" Then as he picks up Palpatine, Anakin more loudly says, \\"Nooo!\\" I've read this described as a \\"scream\\" but that is way overstating it. And contrary to what is commonly being reported, it is also not quite the extended \\"Noooo!\\" from RotS when Vader finds out that Padme is dead. (That may have been the recording they used as a basis, but if so it was augmented and shortened for this scene in RotJ.)  When looking at the complete Star Wars saga, these two additions of the word \\"No\\" do not seem out of place to me at all. Obi-Wan yelled, \\"Noooo!\\" when he saw his Jedi master get struck down by Darth Maul in Episode I. Luke yelled, \\"Nooo!\\" when he saw Vader strike down Obi-Wan in Episode IV. Luke has his mega-no sequence to Vader in Episode V, \\"No... No! That's not true. That's impossible! ... Noooooo! Noo!\\" It seems that now Anakin in Episode VI is just following in a time-honored tradition among his master and son. But at the climax of the six-film saga, it's stated at the prevention of the negative outcome. This broken man who had killed his wife and Jedi master was now sacrificing his life to save their son and destroy the Sith master. My wife, who had made it a game when watching the blu-rays to point out every change to the films she noticed, made no mention of Anakin's new No's. It seemed so natural and appropriate to her that after seeing the blu-ray once, she thought they had always been there.

1600597963|5.0|I spent a glorious day with this new book, by the author of  the incredibly well-received earlier books, Beading with Cabochons, and Bugle Bead Bonanza.<br /><br />What makes this book special?  Frankly, it is the very fact that it IS an instruction/technique book, rather than a book offering projects (although the nine projects which ARE offered, at the end of the book, are stunning).<br />Therefore it focuses primarily on technique, with the fabulous projects for the reader to soar with, after learning or brushing up on, via the previous chapters, all there is to know. A quote I found appropriate to describe this super book  is that it is \\"a remarkable, 160-page encyclopedic guide to bead embroidery techniques with plenty of material for beginners and experienced beaders alike\\" .<br />This is the great concept which makes Dimensional Bead Embroidery so successful in purveying understanding, clearly and in a most excellent manner, to the reader, at every turn.<br /><br />This great technique book also has going for it an astounding collection of beautiful photos (hundreds of them!  to assist with the reader's learning and desire to keep ON learning.  There is nothing like a vast collection of jawdroppingly beautiful photos, clearly taken and stunning, to keep a person learning and loving a jewelry technique book. The drawings which assist the reader to learn each specific technique are excellent as well.<br /><br />Ms. Eakin's book is divided into 9 chapters, and then there is a gallery with what I would consider museum quality contributions from other amazing beaders.<br /><br />Chapter 1 contains a list of materials and tools which you will require.<br />Chapter 2 is \\"Basic Techniques\\". For example, if you are a beginner,  and you are wondering what you may have gotten yourself into, Chapter 2 has REALLY easy to grasp basics like adding a stop bead. Reading a technique book as well done as Dimensional Bead Embroidery  is better in some ways than going to a class, because there are so many people who need to absorb information, starting from step one, repeatedly.  I want to stress this chapter's value because if you are a rank beginner at seed beading, you are not alone when Jamie Cloud Eakin is guiding you. It is as if she is right over your shoulder, anticipating your questions and answering them. She has anticipated them all!<br />Chapter 3  is a chapter I would also like to bring to the fore as super special.<br />Entitled \\"Getting Started and Designing\\", as the author states, \\"This chapter will take you through the steps needed for bead embroidery, with chapters 5 through 8 focusing on the specific stitches and techniques you use in steps 3, 7, and 8, described directly below\\".<br /><br />I was amazed that this book jumped right in to encouraging the reader to learn to design to his or her personal taste at this early stage! What's more, it is so clearly explained, even I can do this. As a designer who primarily works with wire, although I pine to learn to seed bead and do bead embroidery, I now have a resource book to turn to which will enable me to truly understand what I thought was forever going to be beyond my grasp. You will be able to do this too. I find this book to be incredibly inspiring for everyone who has ever looked at seed beading and bead embroidery and said, \\"Oh, I can't do that, although I would love to\\"!  You CAN and you WILL, and the design you ultimately end up with will be your own creation!<br />As Jamie says, earlier, in her introduction, \\"I think my favorite thing about bead embroidery is not only the capacity for variety but also the simplicity.  Even if you can barely sew on a button, you can do this\\".<br />That is the feeling the reader will carry throughout the book and it is a very fun and empowering feeling!<br />Chapter 4 covers using components. This of course is a must for a new seed beading embroidery enthusiast to understand clearly.<br />Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 each explain a varietyof stitches which one needs to know to make the projects which follow in Chapter 9.<br />Chapter 9 is the reader's magnificent reward for learning how to bead embroider using<br />Dimensional Bead Embroidery, A Reference Guide to Techniques, by this wonderful teacher and author.<br />\\"Ceremonial Dance Necklace\\", the necklace which is on the cover, is right there for you to make. It is just as stunning as can be.<br />Another favorite project of mine is called \\"Woodland Secrets Purse\\". I will give you an example of how the book works by using this project. First is listed \\"What You Need\\", then come the \\"Stiches Used\\" and the pages upon which they are located. After that is \\"What You Do\\", with a template for the purse. There are a number of tips and figures to guide you as you make your own version of this lovely piece. At the end of the project is a photo of an absolutely smashing color variation of the same purse.<br /><br />I cannot praise this book enough. It accomplishes what it sets out to do with every step clear and well explained. It s a beautiful book, as I have said, and one anyone can learn from.<br />To sum up,  Jamie Cloud Eakin did a magnificent job with Dimensional Bead Embroidery, A Reference Guide to Techniques ! This wonderful book will serve as a reference guide and  additionally will also inspire any beader who is aching to learn to bead embroider with seed beads.hapter 9.  Chapter 9 is the reader's magnificent reward for learning how to bead embroider using   Dimensional Bead Embroidery, A Reference Guide to Techniques, by this wonderful teacher and author.   \\"Ceremonial Dance Necklace\\", the necklace which is on the cover, is right there for you to make. It is just as stunning as can be.  Another favorite project of mine is called \\"Woodland Secrets Purse\\". I will give you an example of how the book works by using this project. First is listed \\"What You Need\\", then come the \\"Stiches Used\\" and the pages upon which they are located. After that is \\"What You Do\\", with a template for the purse. There are a number of tips and figures to guide you as you make your own version of this lovely piece. At the end of the project is a photo of an absolutely smashing color variation of the same purse.   I cannot praise this book enough. It accomplishes what it sets out to do with every step clear and well explained. It s a beautiful book, as I have said, and one anyone can learn from.  To sum up,  Jamie Cloud Eakin did a magnificent job with Dimensional Bead Embroidery, A Reference Guide to Techniques ! This wonderful book will serve as a reference guide and  additionally will also inspire any beader who is aching to learn to bead embroider with seed beads.
0321647440|1.0|After my purchase I was excited that once I had installed Aperture 3 onto my Mac, I would begin my training. NOT! Will not function under the new OSX Lion 10.7 and the publisher has offered no patch or work around. I cannot return it because I broke the seal on the DVD. This is a great disappointment for my investment of cash and time for this book.  UPDATE NOV 2011: I did contact PeachTree Press and they were kind enough to send a copy that would work with Lion. They said this older DVD from this book seemed to be a real problem for them, and they were working on a solution to fix the problem.
0385474547|5.0|Book arrived as promised in brand new condition.  It is perfect!  Only thing I would note is that it did take a long time to get here, however, I did receive it in time for when I need it for school.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Surprisingly good sound for such a low price! I primarily use it to listen to talk shows on my computer while my wife is asleep, but for the purpose of this review I listed to a little of Bach's Adagios, and Bob Seger (I have widely varying tastes in music), and the sound was perfectly acceptable. I can't do a side-by-side comparison to Bose headphones (I have a hunch that the Bose headphones would win), but for listening to talk or music while working on the computer they are great. I have not tried using it on the treadmill yet, so I can't speak to the stay-in-place or sweat-resistance aspects, and I haven't owned them long enough to offer a valid opinion about durability.
1439192812|5.0|In 1984's film \\"Ghostbusters,\\" there's a comical scene in which a man is being interviewed for the role of the newest member of the \\"ghost busting\\" team, and his interviewer asks him the question, \\"Do you believe in UFOs, astral projections, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster and the theory of Atlantis?\\" He answers, humorously, \\"If there's a steady paycheck in it, I'll believe anything you say.\\" If you'd asked me the same question at the age of 12 or 13, I would have said \\"yes\\" without any hesitation. In fact, I probably would have added some things.<br /><br />Like most children, I was very curious about how the universe worked and how things had come to be the way they were, and, also like most children, by the time I was in middle school I had outgrown the cute educational kids' shows and picture books about dinosaurs and space. School texts were heavier on bare bones facts than on explaining how scientists knew what they did, and books for adults were dry and simply too difficult to keep up with. (I tried, and abandoned, \\"The Origin of Species\\" and \\"Cosmos\\" around this time.) Worse yet, I still had the childish tendency to believe most of what adults told me - and to believe virtually all of what I read. In this perfect storm of inquiry and innocence, I was ripe for the plucking for charlatans and pseudo-scientists. And pluck they did! I wasted much of my time during these formative years reading (and believing) that an alien spacecraft crashed in New Mexico in 1947, that populations of plesiosaurs survived in a few scattered lakes around the world (including, of course, Loch Ness), that it was possible to communicate telepathically, that aliens built the pyramids, and so on, and so on... If only there existed some book that could not only explain science at my level, but give me the mental tools to have some sense of what was really science, and what wasn't.<br /><br />Fortunately for inquiring young minds of today, Richard Dawkins has written that book. \\"The Magic of Reality\\" has been written in such a clear, simple manner as to be both understood and enjoyed by boys and girls of middle school age, \\"caught in the middle\\" as I was, but it's not at all written in a manner as simple as to \\"talk down to\\" them. Dawkins explains lucidly and eloquently (and often humorously) such concepts as evolution, the rotation of the planets, prisms, rainbows, the light spectrum, and a few other things that tend to confuse. A typical chapter begins by posing a question (such as \\"Why are there so many types of animals?\\"), summarizing a couple of ancient myths about the subject (a deity vomited them up for some reason), and then explaining what science actually says about it (variation and natural selection cause life forms to diverge over time). And not only does Dawkins \\"set the record straight,\\" so to speak, but he also explains both the nature and importance of skeptical inquiry and how to use critical thinking to interpret a strange event. He gives a few examples along the lines of \\"X [an extraordinary event] happened. There are three possible explanations for X: 1.) It was a miracle; 2.) It was a coincidence; and 3.) It was a hoax. 3 is more likely than 2, and 2 is more likely than 1. So it probably wasn't a miracle.\\"<br /><br />As I imagine you are fully aware, Dawkins is not one to shy away from controversy. This book is bound to be controversial, for Dawkins doesn't just debunk those silly old myths of every religion that isn't yours. Adam and Eve and the Tree of Knowledge are in there, as is the story of Noah's Ark (though in its original \\"Epic of Gilgamesh\\" form), and one of the extraordinary events broken down into possibilities is the story of Jesus allegedly turning water into wine. But while Dawkins may refute claims of the supernatural, he's actually a proponent of magic - that is, the \\"magic\\" of what is real and what can be studied using real science. This is perhaps the most important thing about the book; it instills (even in myself, a \\"grown up\\" studying science at the university level) a renewed appreciation for science and a sense of wonder about nature. The universe is fascinating and beautiful all by itself, without any help from fairy tales. In this sense, reality truly is magical. And so is \\"The Magic of Reality.\\"he most important thing about the book; it instills (even in myself, a \\"grown up\\" studying science at the university level) a renewed appreciation for science and a sense of wonder about nature.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|This would be a really fun game if I could make it past a level without it crashing on me.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|I won't go into specifics about the movie, as reading other reviews will give you the information you need.  I just want to say that this is a very heart-warming tale about having a young girl and her belief in herself and her family to come back from what most would believe is a career ending... accident.  I hate to call it an accident as a shark bite is NOT what I would consider an accident, but don't know how else to phrase it.<br /><br />Anything is possible, if you have the forbearance and strength to work through it.  This is a true-life tale of fighting and not giving up on what you want!!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I have both the regular Blu-ray and now this version. It was totally worth it!! The extra stuff you get really make it worth your while. I enjoyed seeing all the deleted scenes and the making of.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|Okay, first off I just want to say that I absolutely loved the Dark of the Moon and honestly believe it was probably the best of the three movies.  Special effects were spectacular on the blu-ray and everything just seemed so clear and unbelievable.<br /><br />The only problem I have is...  special features?  Or maybe, the lack thereof.  I honestly have to admit that I didn't really look at the description to see about the special features because... it's a new movie!!  I pretty much thought all new movies came with SOME kind of special features, deleted scenes, commentary, gag reel, SOMETHING!!  But this didn't and it leads me to believe that they'll probably re-release all three together in a special 3-D, blu-ray pack with 'Never Before Seen Footage' etc... etc...  Which is the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5.  That, in a nut shell, irritates the peediddle outta me!!  : )
B0058A119G|5.0|I gave this as a gift and have gotten repeated thank yous.  Arrived fast and you're easy to do business with.
159514188X|5.0|This a novel that really tugs at the heart strings and makes you think. How has your actions effected somebody else? Have you heard something about somebody that made you reluctant to strike up a friendship? Unfortunately for Hannah Baker, one tiny, innocent action snowballed into something big, sending Hannah into a depression.<br />This book held many parallels with my own life. Since I've read this book, I look at the way people treat me and wonder if they even realize what they're doing. I wonder if school counselors, who see what's going on, only give half booty attempts to help because they don't think somebody is really struggling. I recommend this book to anyone, and I think it should be required school reading. Yes, it left that much of an impact on me.
B0034G4P80|2.0|Warning: May contain spoilers<br /><br />Director Kenneth Branagh's \\"Thor\\" has a 2011 look, slick production values, and at the same time feels like one of those never-to-be-taken-seriously 80s action fantasy flicks, along the lines of \\"Masters of the Universe\\" or \\"Superman II\\".<br /><br />And like those 80s not-so-greaties, \\"Thor's\\" storyline is an uninspired snore: In eternal Asgard, Thor acts rashly. Odin disapproves and banishes Thor from Asgard, taking from him his power (Thor's hammer). Thor arrives on Earth. Thor's brother Loki schemes. Odin disapproves of Loki's actions, has a stroke or something, and banishes himSELF into a \\"Norse god coma.\\" Thor befriends a family of earthlings. Loki schemes some more. Thor can't recover his hammer. Thor rescues the earthlings from deadly peril. Odin approves of Thor's act. Thor can finally recover his hammer. Thor fights Loki. The end. Oh, and there are also some frost giants.<br /><br />No, I never read the Marvel comic, but \\"Thor's\\" superheroic feats are definitely of the \\"boys in their early teens\\" variety. The movie is kind of humourous in a goofy way, and not terribly acted, which helps. In fact, the two lead performers, Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, are fairly well realized, not dumbed-down characters who show good chemistry; all their scenes together look and feel right. Hemsworth plays Thor totally straight, as haughty and deific as some transcosmic sci-fi overlord might come across, with each of his Jarlsberg-sculpted lines of dialogue wearing its own Asgard style flowing opera cape; and, mercifully, not one stale pop-culture catchphrase comes from between his chiseled jaws. Portman performs her \\"amused, weirded-out tolerance mixed with mature, scientific wonder\\" with the right balance of gravity and a bit of humour. Perfect score there.<br /><br />It is in its generic take on a lot of the characters who occupy the story's margins where \\"Thor\\" loses most of its points, in my opinion. Anthony Hopkins, in the role of Odin, is an outstanding actor, but the character himself is flat. Odin either A.) approves or B.) disapproves of his sons' deeds, and apart from that, he has little to do: another \\"stern father\\" caricature without nuances or distinguishing personality traits.<br /><br />That Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is jealous of Thor is established from practically the first scene in which both characters appear. Showing more of an inner battle between Loki's jealous, scheming self and his loyal-to-Asgard self might have created some genuine suspense and drama, but, once again, there's nothing here to surprise the movie-viewer.<br /><br />The King of the Jotuns (frost giants), played to the hilt by Colm Feore, is appropriately menacing and demoniac, but he comes across as merely Loki's chesspiece, as lacking in self-determinism as a powerful gun, or, say, Thor's hammer. Having an agenda of his own might've generated more suspense among the Thor-Loki-Frost giant triangle of cross-purposes; but again, no surprises here.<br /><br />And Heimdall (Idris Elba), who ostensibly guards the bridge Bifrost, a bridge between Asgard and other worlds, never appears to actually guard the bridge. Why is the Heimdall character even there, if not to pose some challenge or obstacle, or, in the alternative, to fit key-in-lock into the movie's denouement? He just sort of... is what he is.<br /><br />The verdict: Is Thor a snore? More than the lore of yore, that's for sure. But if your brain needs a night off, then I say go with it. Hoist a flagon of ale, get hammered and watch this 80s redux; and may the mirth and amusement of the gods be thine.
0307277887|4.0|It was a long venture to get through this book, because I have a policy where I don't watch anything before I read the book(s) of basis. I accidentally watched the first season of Dexter before I found out about the book series. So, like a good girl, I refrained from watching the second season and began Dexter. In January. See, there is a reason I have this rule: my love of suspense rivals my love of reading. Another love of mine is being in the know, for when I watch the movies/tv series/whatever based on said book. And although Dexter season 1 and Darkly Dreaming Dexter were different, the gist was basically the same. So, since I knew the gist, it was hard to focus on this book and not read another one.<br />Boring note aside, this book was enjoyable, once I FINALLY sucked it up and read it. Dexter's character is interesting- he's hilarious, a blood spatter analyst, and a serial killer- which makes it fun to read things from his point of view. The mystery, which wasn't such a mystery to me (although a lot of elements were different) was a darn good one. The characters were developed well. I could see them all as real people. Which is why I hate Deb, Dexter's sister. The entire book she was such a grouch. Ugh.<br />I am definitely looking forward to reading the next books in the series. It's the Sookie Stackhouse series all over again.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I carry a multi tool with me for work, and I use it often and it requires sharpening. This little sharpener is very handy to have. The carbide is solid, the rat tail sharpener for serrated blades works great as well. It takes a steady / experienced hand to use that however. I am a mechanical engineer and I by nature scrutinize how things are made, with what materials, build quality, and durability. If you need a handy littler sharpener, that fits nicely into a pocket, this is the one. Carbides are replaceable and can be found at any hardware store, or online. The \\"thumb\\" channel shown is there for a reason. I would recommend using it correctly as there is a danger of cutting onesself due to it's small size. One thing that is most to see irritating is good products getting bad reviews from people who did not read the \\"instructions\\" or think they know how to use it \\"better\\" than what it's intended for, injure themselves, and then blame the product. Better safe than sorry.
1416955070|2.0|This book was super, super hyped up. Like, totally. So of course, like all major hyped up books, I had to see what all the fuss was about. And I have to ask... What IS the fuss all about?<br /><br />The warning signs came early within the book, when the classic cliche of unrequited love between a guy and girl was introduced between protagonist Clary Fray and her best friend Simon. Then, of course, mega hottie Jace Wayland- Shadowhunter extraordinaire- comes into the picture when Clary stumbles upon a demon slaying at a nightclub. Jace is arrogant, charming, hot, you name it. He doesn't take crud from anybody. Clary finds out she's a part of Jace's world after her mother is kidnapped. Kidnapped after her and Clary got into an argument. Angst. It is also discovered that there is a block in Clary's mind, which adds suspense to the otherwise boring story. After this, the book is, admittedly, a page turner to find out what happens next. Will Clary get her memory back? Will she ever find her mother, who seems to be in the hands of the super evil Shadowhunter gone bad, Valentine?<br /><br />The book had a great story. I'm a sucker for anything fantasy, after all, and I am a closet appreciator of romances. However, the author seemed to be targeting a younger audience, and made the characters just passive aggressive enough for anyone going through puberty to enjoy. And the ending, well, we'll just leave it at those two words: the ending. Because I can't find words suitable enough to express my disappointment.<br /><br />Needless to say, I probably won't be finishing the series. But who knows, maybe I will, just for the sake of curiosity.
0812977246|3.0|not exactly as fun as most books. I found it too easy to put down & not exciting enough to be eager to pick it back up (especially the first half). It's a detective thriller set mainly in cold-war Moscow featuring a Soviet investigator with links to the KGB.  This book took me two weeks to read which is way too long.  I like the setting but it just lacks some punch & pacing as it can get bogged down at times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a definite must read! I couldn't put it down and you just fall in love with the characters! Also it gives you a weird perception of society and the rights and wrongs and what exactly a society should be able to do and how much you're willing to risk. The girl on fire was a character you can't help but empathize with and the details make all the characters come to life! It'll get your imagination working!
B005H5H3LW|5.0|Wow, I just finished watching the movie.  I am aware that a lot of my views on this movie are highly biased by my kid years watching this show in the 80's and now I am 46 and an aerospace engineer - but so what!  The movie plot did not follow the 80's anime exactly but again, so what? The movie fits a kid audience that has grown up.  Absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end in spite of all of the changes and I mirror the view that the Zero should have not been modified as much as it was.  For some it will be too slow, but I would like to add something here about the Japanese culture.  I was watching a documentary about a Japanese bicycle shop.  You go into the shop, design your bike on a computer and they will deliver it to you in 4 days.  The truth is that they could deliver it to you in about 2 days, but the shop (and their culture) feels that you will be more excited if you waited the extra days.  The Japanese know how to be patient - it is something that I wish we knew how to be.  So sure, their dialogue was quite extensive - but that is character development and I didn't mind it one bit.  We rely so much on CGI in our movies that I think most of them are crap.  Their love scenes and love development should teach Hollywood a thing or to about being human and classly.  Didn't mind the subtitles, other countries can make fine movies too.  Hopefully Kodai and Yuki's child will grow up and maybe they will develop a sequel of some kind. I can only hope.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|This was a really good pace. Personally, I liked the fact that the chapters were on the shorter side. This book was written by Rebecca Stead and I think she did a wonderful job. Her main character Miranda, was so well developed I felt like she was a real person that I knew in real life. I didn't love the way it ended- it felt a little rushed and I was a little confused. Overall, I really enjoyed this and would definately reccomend it to my friends.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|This CD records a magnificent live performance by the master of song.  I have been listening to this gifted man for more than 40 years, I never tire of him; he has only gotten better over time.  The initial song  on this CD, \\"Lover, lover,\\" appeared on the Commander Cohen CD back in the late 70s, but this newer live version is better and reflects the greatness of his musical arrangements for his backup bands and singers.  The words, the melodies and the musicality of Leonard Cohen have stood the test of time--he is a musical and poetic genius and I urge all that do not know him, to give him a good listen. Finally, it is ironic that Leonard's loss of money in his later life has actually been a gift to his fans who have been bestowed with this CD and his other late-in-life music.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This Blu-ray set was everything i thought it was going to be and more! I ordered it for my husbands birthday and now we have enjoyed many movie nights at home! The Picture and sound is crisp! and the Bonus features make for an interesting take on the movies! I definitely recommend this product!
B004LWZW24|4.0|The films title means \\"A deceitful enemy\\" or \\"Intend to entrap\\" which speaks very well to the whole film!  Plot: The film follows a happy family that has just moved into a new home but immediately after, their son \\"Dalton\\" falls off a ladder and is presumed to be in a coma. Three months later Dalton (still in a state of unconsciousness) has returned as a Sick-in-bed kid who doesn't respond to anything or anyone. Soon after Dalton's return the family starts to have strange disturbances throughout the house that soon turn into a nightmare forcing them to leave the house. Apparently, the disturbances have followed them into there new house and they soon seek help from three professionals named Tucker, Specs, and Elise Rainier who soon find out that it's not the house that's haunted but rather the unconscious Dalton.  It is disturbingly learned that a demon is trying to posses his body while his sole is trapped in another plane of existence.  His father Josh Lambert learns he is the only one who can save him for he has had the same exact thing happen to him as well.   Review: This film is amazingly creepy and even though it stole from other films stories like poltergeist and the exorcist it still was put together quite nicely. Not many films that I've seen have shown what a demons layer looks like nor have I had so many ghosts and evil beings scare me as much as this movie was able to provoke. This movie is superb, thrilling, and frightening and with a 1.5 million dollar budget it still managed to scare me and probably a lot of other people more than films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho or Steven Spielberg's Jaws.  Acting: Some of the acting did seem a bit overdone but the rest was intense and real. The best acting however goes to the demons/ghosts themselves... they sure know how to put on a inappropriate, sinister, and vulgar show while still maintaining a PG-13 Rating!  Gore: nothing worth mentioning.... But this film did not need gore what so ever!  The Bottom Line: A creepy little film that I believe is going to have a large cult... probably not as big as the Blair Witch Project's or Trick r' Treat's but it will always rank up there as one of the creepiest and most devious movie's I've ever seen!  Warning: this film is Rated: \\"PG-13\\" for thematic material, violence, terror and frightening images, and brief strong language  Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: I give it a 7  For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: I give it a 4
B000RH0C8G|4.0|I had the fortune of reading this book a while back and it's great. The epic story of a man versus the world is quite well told and I was gripped throughout the book. Yes, it is a book about statistics, but it's more about taking on the system and changing the world.  I especially like how Billy Beane told the old scouts they were being ridiculous by judging \\"athlete's\\" based on non-statistical principles like girl-friends or looking soft.  Good book, I highly recommend it.
B0053TMP24|4.0|The story is well done and Riordan's evolution as a writer is great.  The story lines progressed nicely.  The story elements are balanced nicely to appeal to a wide range of readers.  However, the formatting for the Kindle was off in many spots and there are numerous type-o's that disrupt the flow.  There are really no excuses for such errors.  The story was fantastic but the type-copy, not so much...
B000784WMW|5.0|If you do not have the time to read Jane Eyre, then watching this version (originally telecast on BBC) is the next best thing to it.  This is the most complete version of Jane Eyre \\"on film\\" and includes most of the story line and plot.  The characters are well-portrayed and great care has been taken so that they are authentic to the period and to the novel. A stand-out is Timothy Dalton as a very passionate and colorful Edward Rochester.    The novel itself is excellent, a true classic, and I would recommend you read it if at all possible.
B0053TMP24|4.0|As the title says, this book is double cool with knobs on (that is to say, RAWKIN!!!!!!) I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!! Of course, there were a few problems, one of them being that the book had SEVERAL typos in it, which I hope was the work of Amazon and not Rick Riordan himself (le horreur!). But I won't give away any details until  see more reviews. Sorry if you're dissapointed, but honestly, it would be a SEROUS CRIME to post any spoilers now. I mean, really, the book just came out today!  Note: Please, if Amazons service is bad, take it up with Amazon itself, and don't give the book one star. That really isn't fair to the fans (and yes, I am one of them) and especially DO NOT GIVE THE BOOK ONE STAR WHEN YOU HAVE NOT READ A SINGLE PAGE OF IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT IS TERRIBLE!!!!!! Overall, this book is amazing. A definite reread. Kudos to Rick!
B004G25V9S|2.0|I got an advance copy of the disk from a friend who helps run a college radio station. And I have been listening to it on and off for the last couple of weeks. This is the first Opeth record I didn't listen to from beginning to end. It's also the first one I won't be buying and loving since I bought Blackwater Park over ten years ago.  There is simply nothing about this record that has any lasting appeal. Everything sounds incredibly forced, from Mikael's vocals to the disjointed song structure. The song parts that are actually beautiful and powerful, and could have been built upon for something truly exceptional, are quickly overrun in the next passage by cheesy, prog bombast.  Not every album can be a gem for any band that's been around for so long, not even Opeth. I just hope the next time Mikael sets down to write again, he spends more time separating the chaff from the wheat.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game reminds me back of my youth playing FFI on the NES. The game is fairly easy to play on a phone. You are not timed, so if you fumble around or get distracted the monsters are going to beat the living snot out of your characters (which is nice because then I don't have to be completely focused on the game). The game is fairly easy, I have never lost a battle (although all my characters have died a few times individually). There are no 'random' encounters. I know some people hate that, but I appreciate the fact that I can avoid most encounters if I choose. One of things I hate about FF is that sometimes you get caught in an area where it is difficult to leave because of all the random encounters. You will either love or hate the bad humor in the game. Personally I enjoy it. My only major complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to maneuver on the game map (I blame that partly on my large fingers on a small touchscreen device). Overall it is an enjoyable throwback RPG game.
0446563048|5.0|Excellent book!!!! Tony Hsieh (Founder of Zappos) is the man and CEO's should learn from him. The book is a very entertaining and easy read that follows Tony through his life and though his actions, you can see that he is driven by a passion to make a difference and run his company in a way where everyone feels part of the team and enjoys coming to work!! Beware, on a side note...After reading this book you're going to want to online to Zappos and buy something!!!\\"

0385534639|5.0|I try to read a good mix of classic and modern fiction, but often end up disappointed by modern fiction. I picked up The Night Circus mainly because of the summary description of two magicians battling it out in a circus and the look of the book cover . . . if that description is not enough to intrigue you, then you probably won't like this book. If it is, you'll love it.<br /><br />For a first time author, what Erin Morgenstern accomplishes with her descriptions of The Circus of Dreams is nothing short of amazing. You will smell the the caramel apples, you will visit fascinating tents and sideshows, and you will long to visit after you close the last page. The descriptions and transportation of the reader to this place is worthy of five stars by itself, but the good news is the story is pretty good too. Don't spoil any part of the story by reading too much about it, just pick it up.<br /><br />Pick up this book and enjoy the read, you will be glad you did. One last thing: make sure you get the hardcover book, not the Kindle version. It's a beautifully made book and worth the few extra bucks.

B005LMEB8E|4.0|Demi Lovato's latest effort, Unbroken, contains more runs than a post-Pizza-Hut toilet. Don't let the fecal imagery mislead you. These runs are vocal nuances that would put X-tina out of work (if she weren't already). With Unbroken, Demi has proven herself a miniature powerhouse. She hasn't completely peeled off those mouse ears, though; the record still tastes of vanilla. Her team has squirted in some Hershey's syrup this time around, offering collaborations with Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Dev, Iyaz, and Jason Derulo. The Hershey's metaphor might be unsettling after all this talk about the runs, but it applies perfectly to Demi's attempt at building her ghetto cred. Just as Hershey's syrup doesn't mix perfectly with white milk and leaves you wanting real chocolate milk, so these songs seem unsatisfying and out of place. This is especially true on \\"You're My Only Shorty,\\" which finds Demi acting as Iyaz's groupie. Second single, \\"Who's That Boy (feat. Dev),\\" is an infectious earworm that channels Rihanna's \\"Rude Boy\\" and bounces with Ryan Tedder's signature drum-heavy flair. The most successful of her collaborations is  \\"Together (feat. Jason Derulo),\\" an uplifting kumbaya anthem that makes you want to go hold hands with your neighbor, or at least get drunk and go clubbing with them. One album highlight is the title track, which endears you to empowerment even if it does mimic Robyn's \\"Indestructible\\" and boasts a chorus that gives Ke$ha a run for her $.   Club-bangers aside, Lovato is one hell of a balladeer. There is no denying \\"Skyscraper\\" is an emotionally stirring masterpiece. The other Toby-Gad-penned track on the album, \\"My Love Is Like a Star,\\" is a soulful gem that could serve as filler on an American Idol winner's debut. Once you get past the inadvertent product placement on \\"Fix a Heart,\\" the song is another shining moment for damaged-goods Demi; so much so that I'm now stuck on Band-Aid brand. You never really can fix a heart, but germs don't stick on me.Let's choose to ignore \\"For The Love Of A Daughter\\" for its resemblances to Lindsay Lohan's \\"Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father).\\" Yikes. In all seriousness, Demi's daddy-issues song is significantly more moving, and the vocal delivery is, well, done by an actual singer.   Other noteworthy tracks: \\"Lightweight\\" is an elegant what-up to Lovato's eating disorder, and it will be a \\"hit repeat\\" song for that obsessive, self-destructive chick in all of us. \\"In Real Life\\" demonstrates unprecedented amounts of sass (paging Jessie J), not to mention vocal dexterity, making it one of the sleeper hits on the album. \\"Give Your Heart A Break\\" is a thumping independent-woman jumper that would make Kelly Clarkson raise a fist in solidarity.  It's quite possibly the album's best track you will never hear--unless you download it.   Unbroken leaves all us gays and single girls feeling a little more complete. Demi's syrupy former-cutter emo-ness trumps her cotton candy counterpart, Selena Gomez, any day (not to discredit Ms. Gomez...or the Scene). Since her Camp Rock days, Demi Lovato has always been one to watch, and now she is producing some moments of pop perfection. When she goes from unbroken to fully healed, there's no telling what sort of force to be reckoned with she could become. We'll dance it (and cry it) out to these tracks in the meantime.
0385534639|5.0|I don't even know how to begin this review. 'The Night Circus' is like nothing I have ever read before and I doubt I will encounter something of its caliber again. The basic plot of the novel revolves around a circus that is only open at night and seemingly comes from nowhere. Inside its gates are entertainers that you would have to see to believe and tents with interiors you couldn't begin to fathom. The circus itself is a magical place, but it is merely a venue for a challenge between two illusionists and their students. However, it is a story about destiny and love as much as it is about magic.<br /> Morgenstern's vivid imagery and descriptions let the reader lose themselves in the magical world of Le Cirque des Reves and once they are immersed, they will not want to leave. The well-imagined story and the rounded and likeable characters add so much depth to the novel that it feels as though we are not just reading; we are actually interacting with the circus and its performers. Readers will revisit the book in order to lose themselves to the magical world within its pages. 'The Night Circus' is thoroughly enchanting and is easily one of the best books of the year.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This film is a great life lesson for kids and adults. Ms. Hamilton proves that the obstacles that can truly defeat us are the ones that we create ourselves. When My kids saw it the first time they wanted to see it again. That was O K with me because I got more out of it the second time. The kids immediately wanted the book. I found it Amazon and they have both read it. My Little girl is 10 and my boy is almost 7. I wasn't sure if He would be O K with the shark scene. It was really amazing how quickly it occurred. The scene was realistic without being gory.  In a split second this young girls life was changed but not altered.<br /> My kids often refer to Bethany Hamilton when they are faced with challenges. She is a fantastic gift to humanity. In a time where kids are subjected to any number manufactured role models, here is a true spiritual giant. Her faith, grit and perseverance are a reminder to all of us that, regardless of the hand life deals us, faith is our ace in the hole. Soul Surfer is a valuable message for tough times.  The CD gets a lot of play when the kids have friends over. Well done.

B0017OB12O|5.0|What is there left to say about this great film?  It's worth noting that director David Lean's association with actor Alec Guinness goes back to his stupendous film of 1946 \\"Great Expectations\\" which Leonard Maltin refers to as \\"One of the greatest films ever made\\" with which I am in complete agreement.  There are precious few films directed by Lean in which Alec Guinness does not appear.  All that notwithstanding Lean and Guinness came to a major disagreement during the making of \\"Bridge\\" over Guinness's characterization and were not on speaking terms for a good part of the production period.  They had to have a messenger convey their communications.  I believe that when Guinness saw the finished cut of the film, he had to admit that David was right.    The film has  an excellent cast:  William Holden, Sessue Hayakawa, James Donald and particularly Jack Hawkins, my favorite British actor.  His stunning performance in the great Ealing film \\"The Cruel Sea\\" (1953) about the war in the Atlantic during World War II is still among the best films of its kind.    The Blu-ray version of \\"Bridge\\" is of particular benefit to this beautifully photographed film.  It has been pointed out that the explosions seen destroying the bridge do not correspond to the placement of the charges as seen the night before.  But that doesn't take away from the great power of this now classic film.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I purchased this CD for my sister and she loved it... to be expected.  I listened to some of it as well, and I have to admit it was not too bad.  I know she would definitely recommend this to anyone who listens to country.

0385344325|3.0|As a diehard Lee Child fan, I always eagerly await his new books. While THE AFFAIR is well-written (as all of his novels are) - it lacks the excitement and momentum we've come to love from Child. If this is your FIRST Lee Child - do NOT start here. Start with PERSUADER which has one of the greatest opening chapters ever. Read all the early ones first before moving to the last 3-4 years. I will always be loyal to Lee Child as I know he has a phenomenal one in store for us soon. I hope.  PS: It is a complete travesty and tragedy that Tom Cruise was cast as Reacher. Leave it Hollywood to f-up everything it touches. Sad indeed.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Just like the title mentions, I tried everything. I moved it up and down and all around. Nothing I did made this work, I stood in positions that only the top yogi's would attempt, just to get this thing to recognize me. Calibration was hit or miss and games just the same. In fact most games rarely worked if at all.  Like others I thought I was tech savvy enough to give it a go, I'm unhappy that I did. 2hrs wasted, wish I had just listened to the reviews, hopefully you will heed mine and everyone else's warning.

0553386794|5.0|I was turned onto this series from friends that had watched the HBO special and instead of watching the series I investigated the book.  I'm not \\"into' fantasy.  I could not read any of the \\"Hobbit\\" books, I could not make it through \\"Dune\\".  However - I do like historical books and all the reviews SEEMED interesting.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I have ever read. I'm not going to review the book as others have but from a person that reads historical war novels and hard science fiction this is an outstanding book.  The language is perfect and the author just draws you in.<br /><br />I was warned that it starts off slow . . . . NOT A PROBLEM. This book is written so expertly that nothing HAS to happen.  Every day life as told by characters so rich that it's almost like a reality show. What they eat, what they wear is fascinating.  There has not been one spot where I skipped over paragraphs to \\"get on with it\\" (you know, like Tom Clancy novels).<br /><br />This is one of the first books in my life that I have actually been moved by the words.  When Bren comes out of his coma (don't worry, not a big surprise) the writing was amazing, it's like you can not read fast enough!  I read part to my mom and my voice actually broke a little.<br /><br />All I can say is WOW!!!
1449389627|5.0|Excellent book! All the positive reviews on Amazon were right on target!  I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to think outside the box.  When trying to work on something from inception, it good to know that it wasn't as easy as the history books make it out to be.  Being an innovator takes time, passion and hard work.  This book does an excellent job illustrating that fact.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|When I saw the  TV spots for this movie I knew what was going to happen crazy things were going to happen & everybody dies like any other 1st person found footage horror movie. Other than The Blair Witch Project  & a few others  I'm tired of these movies as much as I am torture p  or  n. I was right about the ending everyone dies & Bob Weinstein said \\"We didn't shoot it we found it. \\" Yeah why don't you & your brother go find the 25 or 70 minutes of footage that you cut out of Crow City Of Angels. Directed by Gonzalo Lopez Gellego who hasn't directed anything of note. Stars Warren Christe as Ben Anderson, Lloyd Owen as Nathan Walker & Ryan Robbins as John Grey. Story is 3 crew members of Apollo 18 have been sent on a \\"secret\\" mission on The Moon by The Defense Department. They find a Russian Space Shuttle & find a dead Cosmonaut. Basically this movie is very boring. Weird s  h  i  t happens Commander Walker & Lietutenant Grey look around. Walker feels something moviing in his suit you know scratch where it itches. Ben Anderson grabs Walker & finds a rock in his side. Walker denies what happend & becomes infected. Lietutenant Grey is abroad Freedom & can't contact Houston. Walker goes crazy & damages the system controls. Now this is a ripoff of Alien & The Thing not Levithan that was a homoage. They need to get to The Russian Shuttle to try & escape. Walker to run & stay so he won't risk infecting anyone. Walker is pulled into a crater. Anderson looks for him but these bad CGI spider rock  creatures come alive he runs to The Russian Shuttle & contacts The DOD & they tell him he will die they can't rescue him. Cutting to the chase everybody dies & the movie passes it off as a real event. This will make my list of the worst of the year. Gonzalo Lopez Gellego didn't do a good job directing. & I agree with critics for once. Unfortantly it made it's money back. Apollo 18 I don't recommend.

B0052GACNM|1.0|A review by an anonymous person.  NOT FRED.  I thought this fella had retired years ago. Surprised to see him doing a cd with Lady GaGa etc. Gaga sounds great but Tony = vile. I've listened to the samples and i think his voice is awful! Never have liked his vocals and i honestly think he sounds worse than ever. Time for Mr Bennett to definitely retire. Good idea blurring out his face on the cd cover makes him look less scary. Creepy music for creepy people! Just my opinion folks so don't get too upset.  OK Bennett babes now you can attack me !

0810997827|5.0|My grandson (he's 9 yrs old) came to visit us from Mexico last summer, and he brought a book with him... He likes to read and I've often mailed books to him, so when I asked him which book he was reading, he told me \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\".  The first night here, when he went to bed, he asked if he could read for me, and sure enough, we read for the next 1/2 hour. We had so much fun, and that's the way it went, every night he read for me from that book.  So when I found you had the \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid Box of Books\\", I couldn't wait to get it for him.  He just loved them, all 4 books!

B00095NX9G|5.0|This DVD set is 2 disks, and it's so loaded with information that it's REALLY worth the price! The quality is good, it's very professional, and you also get to see very clean, lovely, well done performances by Rachel.  You actually get the equivalent of 2 yoga classes, which pays for its self, since yoga classes add up.  You get a number of drills, plus you get instructed with choreography classes.   The usefulness of just 1, or the other, disk is a good value, because you can use, mix, and practice lessons for years.  Plus, she also gives lectures, pointers, and teaches a number of things. And, she's already thought out how to use the material and lessons to make the most of it.   This is THE best DVD set Rachel Brice has ever done. It's not difficult to understand, it's challenging, it's VERY professional, is of high quality, and is very thought out and thorough.   She makes the lessons easy to understand, easy to follow, but there are also many VERY challenging parts, and very hard parts, that it give the viewer an incentive to WANT to eventually reach that difficult challenge in the future, and work for it. She's also very aware as a teacher that some parts have this difficulty to them so she will urge the viewer to just keep trying, because it's the only way to eventually get it. Even when you find a difficult part, she will never discourage you, but encourage you.

B004XCUEU2|5.0|Wow -- what a compelling and fun documentary! Back and Forth starts with the early career of Foo Fighters' founder Dave Grohl, including personal revelations and commentary about the death of Kurt Cobain by Grohl and others (like Nevermind producer Butch Vig). After the end of Nirvana Grohl took eight months off then recorded songs he'd written over the past few years; liking what he heard, he asked the rhythm section of recently-demised Sunny Day Real Estate to join him, and FF was off the ground. The retrospective continues chronologically through lineup changes and albums and lineup changes and tours and drama and lineup changes, with candid commentary from each of the band members (current and former) and lots of great concert footage, home videos, funny music videos and fascinating behind-the-scenes extras. The film finishes with the delightful process of recording the group's latest release, 2011's Wasting Light, which took place at Grohl's home with the band members' families around, produced by Butch Vig and with input from Husker Du's Bob Mould and ex-Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic playing on \\"I Should Have Known\\", a haunting tearjerker that addresses Grohl's feelings about Cobain these many years later. The final scene shows a live performance of \\"Burning Bridges\\" while each band member acknowledges how lucky they are. Which is a nice change from the angsty, drug-addled hedonism we so often get from entertainment folk. Like Metallica's Some Kind of Monster, you want to watch this again right away, and find yourself loving the band even more.<br /><br />I especially liked the footage of Grohl giving in to his daughter's pleas to go swimming; we see them in the pool while Mould and Vig work on a track in Dave's garage. It emphasizes the difference between Cobain and Grohl -- one who shone bright and flamed out, and one who has persevered and grown -- maturing into a fine musician with a great group around him. I've always liked FF but come away from this film with an even deeper admiration for them.<br /><br />While the concert footage was great fun, what I truly adored was seeing the process -- the writing, the practicing, the backstage jokes. Extra features are also a blast: pre-production of \\"These Days\\"; MMM-MMM (with possible KFC revenue to follow!); \\"On the Mend\\" with its revelation that Grohl is a typical guy; Dave Struggles with Recording; the wonderful glimpse of duo drumming in \\"Bridge Burning\\" Rhythm Plan; Krist Novoselic on Accordion(!); the hysterical Taylor's Cymbals; Mixing (including the car test); and an Alternate Ending.<br /><br />You know in a lot of ways getting older stinks, but the good part is that I have a great catalogue of music experiences. It was pretty awesome to be a little kid when Beatles albums were coming out, and at university when Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zepellin's Physical Graffiti arrived. I get the same feeling here -- that this is an amazing group, and with \\"Wasting Light\\" we are seeing the arrival of a classic, fittingly bringing some closure to Grohl's history with Nirvana.<br /><br />I rented this on Netflix and am going to buy it because I liked it so much. Awesome! Highest recommendation.n even deeper admiration for them.

B0034G4P80|4.0|I didn't have faith in Thor before it came out, but I was blown away when I saw it in theaters. I came in knowing that the movie would 1) be very influenced by the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Thor, and 2) would act as the second-to-final tie-in to the Avengers film coming soon, a trend that was started by the Iron Man film in 2008. So the concept of the movie's plot takes half the film to modern-day Earth, and the remaining half takes place in Thor's gorgeous homeland of Asgard. The battle scenes are very well-done, and the acting is just as it should be. It's not utterly incredible but it's not poor whatsoever. And, as with Iron Man and Incredible Hulk, the humor is well-placed and appropriate. The \\"culture-clash\\" between Thor and the Earth-born humans he comes to befriend is where many of the scenes the film has derives its hilarity from.   However, I feel the problem, if any, is the films relation to the upcoming Avengers film. Unlike the previous Avenger movies--Iron Man 1&2, Incredible Hulk and Cap. America--Thor's primary purpose it would seem is to tie-in to the Avengers instead of having Thor on his own adventure separate of consistent intervention and invasion from SHIELD agents, particularly Phil Coulson's character, who first appeared in Iron Man.   However if that doesn't bother you, the movie should put a smile on your face, even if you know little about Marvel's Thor. I would recommend reading up on him just a little bit on Wikipedia or whathaveyou, and know his more modern iterations within the Marvel comic universe---particularly the Ultimate Marvel version of Thor, aka \\"Ultimate\\" Thor.  Even without the comic book geek knowledge, this is a fun and fast movie, with fantastic fight scenes, character development, and a great ending.   SPOILER ALERT--A subtle cameo by Marvel Comic's Hawkeye was unexpected and exciting.
B004C4IKCU|5.0|Conscripted into the American Army in March 1958 and discharged two years later, Sergeant Presley was a mere 18 days back in the USA when RCA practically frogmarched him into their Nashville Studios to cut some new material for a highly-expectant public. So it's perhaps strange now in hindsight to think that 1960's \\"Elvis Is Back!\\" - his most beloved of studio albums - only went to Number 2 on release. But I can assure you that there is nothing second-place about this 50th Anniversary reissue. It's a gem. Here are the details...<br /><br />Released 8 March 2011 in the USA (28 February in the UK) - RCA/Legacy 88697 85300 2 contains 2 whole albums and 12 x 7\\" single-sides (5 of which reached Number 1).<br />Its 36 STEREO tracks break down as follows:<br /><br />Disc 1 (50:43 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 12 are the US LP \\"Elvis Is Back!\\" - released 8 April 1960 on RCA Victor LPM-2231 [Mono] and LPS-2231 [Stereo]<br />Tracks 13 and 14 are \\"Stuck On You\\" and \\"Fame And Fortune\\" - the A&B-sides of RCA Victor 47-7740 - released 23 March 1960<br />Tracks 15 and 16 are \\"It's Now Or Never\\" and \\"A Mess Of Blues\\" - the A&B sides of RCA Victor 47-7777 - released 5 July 1960<br />Tracks 17 and 18 are \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\\" and \\"I Gotta Know\\" - the A&B sides of RCA Victor 47-7810 - released 1 November 1960<br />Track 19 is \\"Surrender\\" - the A-side of RCA Victor 47-7850 - released 7 February 1961<br /><br />Disc 2 (39:23 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 12 are the US LP \\"Something For Everybody\\" - released 17 June 1961 on RCA Victor LPM-2370 [Mono] and LSP-2370 [Stereo]<br />Track 13 is \\"I Feel So Bad\\" - the A-side of RCA Victor 47-7880 - released 2 May 1961<br />Tracks 14 and 15 are \\"(Marie's The Name) His Latest Flame\\" and \\"Little Sister\\" - the A&B-sides of RCA Victor 47-7908 - released 8 August 1961<br />Tracks 16 and 17 are \\"Good Luck Charm\\" and \\"Anything That's Part Of You\\" - the A&B sides of RCA Victor 47-7992 - released 27 February 1962<br /><br />The really big news in 2011 is a new VIC ANESINI remaster with truly BEAUTIFUL sound quality. Anesini is not new to Elvis reissues; he handled the 2CD 'Legacy Editions' of \\"Elvis Presley\\" and \\"From Elvis In Memphis\\" as well as the 4CD set \\"The Complete '68 Comeback Special\\" - with unanimous praise heaped on all three.<br /><br />Musically - like Sam Cooke's \\"Night Beat\\" (1963 on RCA) and Roy Orbison's \\"Lonely And Blue\\" (1961 on Monument) - these Elvis Presley 'Living Stereo' recordings have long been the stuff of audiophile wet dreams. The previous reference point is the 2005 \\"Follow That Dream\\" 2CD reissue where the sound quality is superb  - and yet here - it is somehow elevated even further. The effect is instantaneous - Otis Blackwell's \\"Make Me Know It\\" is the album opener and every instrument is wonderfully clear and full of HUGE presence. That's followed by Presley's stripped-down version of the Little Willie John/Peggy Lee classic \\"Fever\\" - with razor sharp audio on Bob Moore's Double Bass and Buddy Harmon's Percussive shuffles and snare-drum whacks.<br /><br />I love \\"It Feels So Good\\" with the sexy slink of Scotty Moore's guitar and the schmooze of Floyd Cramer's piano tinkling. It all leads up the big-duo finishers - \\"Like A Baby\\" (lyrics above) and \\"Reconsider Baby\\". In his musical and vocal element - Elvis lets rip on these stunning bluesy workouts. The effect has always removed the pain of the Vegas years for fans and will instantly stop any Presley sceptic within a ten-mile radius. And by the time you reach the saxophone of Boots Randolph half way through \\"Reconsider Baby\\" - the audio onslaught is just incredible. Never mind 'living stereo' - you'll think these guys are in your living room...<br /><br />The 2nd album is a bit of a forgotten gem too. Tracks 1 to 6 are \\"The Ballads Side\\" with 7 to 12 being \\"The Rhythm Side\\". Highlights include his chipper version of Charlie Rich's \\"I'm Coming Home\\" while \\"Put The Blame On Me\\" is great Sixties pop. And it all sounds wonderful. The singles too are embarrassingly strong - the sexy strut of the kissing song \\"Stuck On You\\" and the reworking of the Clovers hit \\"There's No Tomorrow\\" which would eventually became the huge Salsa hit \\"It's Now Or Never\\". Brilliant.<br /><br />The packaging is lovely to look at. A 3-way card digipak features the gorgeous \\"Elvis Is Back!\\" colour artwork on the front with the \\"Something For Everybody\\" full-colour sleeve on the inside flap. There are full-colour repros of the US pictures sleeves for \\"His Latest Flame\\" and \\"It's Now Or Never\\" (a contender for his best ever picture sleeve) featured beneath the see-through CD trays - while the 24-page booklet is crammed full of spot-on discography stuff by lifetime fan and keeper of the flame - ERNST MIKAEL JORGENSEN - a name Presley fans will be comfortable with (even if his wording is a little flowery here and there). There are the 'bonus' G.I. snapshots that came with original gatefold albums, snaps of Elvis with Frank Sinatra about to do the Timex TV Special, more US 7\\" picture sleeves, trade adverts, holding his Army discharge papers up etc. Jorgensen also rightly praises behind-the-scenes heroes like Producer STEVE SHOALS and RCA's perfectionist Studio-Engineer BOB PORTER and his Telefunken U-47 microphones. It's very nicely done...<br /><br />Niggles - a look at the total playing time of each disc and RCA is not exactly pushing the digital boat out here. And when you reference the incredible 53 tracks of the 2005 \\"Follow That Dream\\" 2CD reissue - some may feel it would have been better to do 2 separate Legacy Editions - one for \\"Elvis Is Back!\\" and another for \\"Something For Everybody\\" - both featuring copious amounts of 'outtakes' and the elusive LPM MONO mixes of both albums. There are two B-sides missing when there was plenty of room to include them. But like the Legacy Edition of \\"Elvis Presley\\" (his explosive 1956 debut album) which is presented in a similar way - you could also argue that what you've actually got here is less fussy and more defined. It's a matter of personal opinion I suppose.<br /><br />To sum up - \\"Elvis Is Back! Legacy Edition\\" is a timely reminder of his genius and a STEREO gem in his otherwise patchy Sixties catalogue. It boasts a fabulous new remaster, affectionate presentation by a man who cares and isn't going to break your bank balance either. I'd say snap it up and proceed with haste to the MONO \\"Elvis Presley\\" to see what all the fuss is about (see separate review).<br /><br />I'd better go now because I can feel a need to tame \\"...a team of wild horses...\\"<br /><br />The King folks. Remember him this way...<br /><br />PS: For other Vic Anesini Remasters - see my reviews for \\"Be What You Want...\\" the 4CD Box Set by HALL & OATES, the Legacy Edition of \\"Couldn't Stand The Weather\\" by STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN and the Legacy Edition of \\"Tomorrow The Green Grass\\" by THE JAYHAWKS. He has also done the much-praised Columbia issues of Simon And Garfunkel's back catalogue and the already mentioned Roy Orbison album \\"Lonely And Blue\\"gles too are embarrassingly strong - the sexy strut of the kissing song \\"Stuck On You\\" and the reworking of the Clovers hit \\"There's No Tomorrow\\" which would eventually became the huge Salsa hit \\"It's Now Or Never\\". Brilliant.<br /><br />The packaging is lovely to look at. A 3-way card digipak features the gorgeous \\"Elvis Is Back!\\" colour artwork on the front with the \\"Something For Everybody\\" full-colour sleeve on the inside flap. There are full-colour repros of the US pictures sleeves for \\"His Latest Flame\\" and \\"It's Now Or Never\\" (a contender for his best ever picture sleeve) featured beneath the see-through CD trays - while the 24-page booklet is crammed full of spot-on discography stuff by lifetime fan and keeper of the flame - ERNST MIKAEL JORGENSEN - a name Presley fans will be comfortable with (even if his wording is a little flowery here and there). There are the 'bonus' G.I. snapshots that came with original gatefold albums, snaps of Elvis with Frank Sinatra about to do the Timex TV Special, more US 7\\" picture sleeves, trade adverts, holding his Army discharge papers up etc. Jorgensen also rightly praises behind-the-scenes heroes like Producer STEVE SHOALS and RCA's perfectionist Studio-Engineer BOB PORTER and his Telefunken U-47 microphones. It's very nicely done...<br /><br />Niggles - a look at the total playing time of each disc and RCA is not exactly pushing the digital boat out here. And when you reference the incredible 53 tracks of the 2005 \\"Follow That Dream\\" 2CD reissue - some may feel it would have been better to do 2 separate Legacy Editions - one for \\"Elvis Is Back!\\" and another for \\"Something For Everybody\\" - both featuring copious amounts of 'outtakes' and the elusive LPM MONO mixes of both albums. There are two B-sides missing when there was plenty of room to include them. But like the Legacy Edition of \\"Elvis Presley\\" (his explosive 1956 debut album) which is presented in a similar way - you could also argue that what you've actually got here is less fussy and more defined. It's a matter of personal opinion I suppose.<br /><br />To sum up - \\"Elvis Is Back! Legacy Edition\\" is a timely reminder of his genius and a STEREO gem in his otherwise patchy Sixties catalogue. It boasts a fabulous new remaster, affectionate presentation by a man who cares and isn't going to break your bank balance either. I'd say snap it up and proceed with haste to the MONO \\"Elvis Presley\\" to see what all the fuss is about (see separate review).<br /><br />I'd better go now because I can feel a need to tame \\"...a team of wild horses...\\"<br /><br />The King folks.

B00008G7UJ|1.0|Baz Luhrmann's film neatly instantiates its own thesis that all good things can be turned into garbage.  Witness Claire Danes' so-called Juliet, with her blank face, toneless voice and general incompetence.  Witness the stunningly inept DiCaprio, who makes Shakespeare sound like Pig-Latin.  But the trasher-in-chief is Luhrmann, with his bottomless reserves of vulgarity, ignorance and tastelessness.  Every frame of this abortion is hostile to words.
B004LWZW4C|3.0|THE STORY WAS GOOD BUT IT TOOK A BIT TO GET IT GOING.. BUT WHEN IT DID TAKE OFF , IT STAYED IN THE AIR.. I THINK THE SHOULD DO A BACK GROUND ON ALL THE MAIN GUYS LIKE THEY DID FOR LOGAN \\" WOLVERINE\\"
1423140591|5.0|This review is an overview and does not contain spoilers.<br /><br />I find Riordan's take on Greek mythology to be fun and light-hearted, but with a deep knowledge and respect for the source material. The first series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, was completed in five volumes and it seemed that the ending wrapped everything up neatly. The World As We Knew It Was Saved and we could all go back to living our lives.<br /><br />Heh, heh, heh.<br /><br />Rick realized that there was a built in sequel utilizing little known stories from Greek Mythology and inserted a prophecy at the end of The Last Olympian to use as a starting point for his new series The Heroes of Olympus.<br /><br />This new series expands his universe to include Roman mythology. I was of the opinion that Roman mythology was pretty much the same as Greek mythology with different names for most of the gods and goddesses with a few additional minor Roman deities.<br /><br />Riordan shows that the two sets of mythologies are not equivalent and that the Roman gods have different personalities and aspects from their Greek counterparts. I find this to be way cool.<br /><br />Son of Neptune is the second book in this planned five book series and it is released today.<br /><br />Without including spoilers, I want to encourage those who love Medievalism and mythology who have not read the books to start reading them and to begin at the beginning with The Lightning Thief.<br /><br />Riordan's style encourages a desire to learn more about both Greek and Roman mythology as well as ancient history.<br /><br />In the Percy Jackson and the Olympian series, the Greek demigods were kept in a camp protected by magical boundaries against monsters. This was Camp Half-Blood off Long Island Sound. Click to see an interactive map of Camp Half-Blood.<br /><br />And now, in The Son of Neptune, we are introduced to the camp for the Roman demigods. Here is a link to interactive map of Camp Jupiter near the Berkeley and Oakland Hills in California. It is different because the Roman cities were different from Greek ones. There are baths, a forum, a colliseum and even a circus maximus. How cool is that?<br /><br />There was even a line in this book mentioning the division in the old Roman Empire between the Western and the Eastern empires with the Greeks maintaining control of the eastern half. This was then to be replicated in subsequent generations when the center of Western Civilization might migrate and explaining why Camp Half-Blood for Greek demigods was on the east coast and Camp Jupiter for Roman demigods was on the west coast.<br /><br />I enjoyed that touch, and know that Riordan probably did not plan this detail when he first set up the Percy Jackson universe but recognized it later and decided this synchronicity needed to be mentioned in passing in the text.<br /><br />So to me, this is learning history on the fly for my son while entertaining him and engaging his mind.<br /><br />In The Son of Neptune, Riordan expands his universe with more characters that are heroic and some seem downright creepy. Octavian is a Roman demigod with a talent for reading auguries. Rather than opening live animals and examining their entrails, he uses stuffed animals and looks at the stuffing. For kids who snuggle every night with teddy bears, that might be a more disturbing image than reading about a live animal being vivisected.<br /><br />Either way, the character of Octavian is one who bears watching to see if he will betray everyone for his own personal gain.<br /><br />A new hero in this book is Frank Zhang who has Chinese heritage *and* an echoing tenuous connection to life as did Meleager of the Calydonian Boar Hunt fame. I had forgotten the details of Meleager's story from Greek mythology, but it was found easily with a Google search. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Riordan's ability to weave in such details in his narrative demonstrating his love for the source material.<br/><br />Overall impressions:<br /><br />The story is fast paced with a great dollop of humor and inclusion of myth and history. One scene had Percy and his friends hiding under the furry blue butt of a Hyperborean giant. This brought about the mental image of Rudolph and Hermie being between the Bumble's legs.<br /><br />And later, Riordan had Death using an iPad. I laughed out loud at both of these absurdities that he included to amuse his readers.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly as well as all the preceding novels and I look forward to reading The Mark of Athena next year. Especially since my favorite goddess is named in the title.furry blue butt of a Hyperborean giant. This brought about the mental image of Rudolph and Hermie being between the Bumble's legs.

0425220931|5.0|What a fabulous book on life's journey.  It is so filled with more metaphysical truths than any other \\"metaphical\\" spiritual book that is supposed to be helpful!<br />Every other page the book gives you a hint to improve your own life among it's fictional characters.  A must book for the spiritual Seeker!
B0034G4P80|4.0|I enjoy \\"Superhero\\" movies and I was waiting for this to come out on DVD since I didn't have a chance to see it in the theatre.  I was happily suprized at the great acting by all the actors and actresses in this movie.  The special effects were excellent as well.  Chris Hemsworth plays Thor and is a good actor.  I enjoy his humor in the movie and portrays Thor well.  The beautiful Natalie Portman is great as well as the scientist/love interest in the movie, she doesn't take herself too seriously in the movie and it is fun to watch her in it.  Sir Anthony Hopkins as always is an outstading actor and portrays the overall Norse God Odin, (father of Thor).  Tom Hiddleston plays the \\"evil\\" Loki and is a pleasure to watch as well.  The story keeps you interested and the special effects are awesome.  Highly Recommended movie to fans of \\"Superheroes\\"!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is a good bag for the $. Has plenty of storage space, all my lenses, filters, cameras, cleaning equipement fit nicely within  protected compartments that are adjustable.  Plenty of extra space for anything else you may want to bring along. It would be nice if it inlcuded more smaller pockets for very small things like extra memory cards, and spare batteries.  I like to separate the really small items into compartments so you don't have to fumble through the larger zippered pockets. That's the only reason I don't give this a 5 star rating. Overall though, very happy with this purchase.
B00000IQUT|5.0|The item was received in a very timely manner and the condition was great just as described. I am Very happy with my purchase.

B004WE01YA|5.0|I just finished watching this in 3D and all i can say is that this version blew me away. I normally don't review movies i purchase on amazon but i could not get over this transfer.  This is now my gem of all my Blu Ray 3D movies, period.  The beautiful forest opening scene that was created by the multiplane camera grabs your attenttion like never before with the 3D effect.  And from then on you can see the amount of effort that was put into transfering the original classic in to a full 3D feature.  This is in no way a cheesy transfer like some of the movies that have been coming out recently.  I was so blown away by this transfer that i showed my parents some of the scenes and they from the start just said \\"WoW\\" and were hooked to watch the film to its end.  The beautiful animation just stands out in this 3D feature and is truly gorgeous.  Truely this is the best way to watch this film, but of course this is just my opinion but i cannot say it enough that you should give it a chance.  If you ever wanted to revisist the magic of Beauty and the Beast this is possibly the best way you could of ever have asked for. A++
B005MVIF7M|5.0|...that is really FUN! You can listen on multiple levels.  Both your playful heart or your thoughtful mind will be satisfied.
0670022411|2.0|I confess I did not finish this book.  I was bored to tears by 25%.  Because I paid so much, and because I had high hopes for such a popular book, I stuck with it up to 83%.  It was a loooong 83%, filled with fluff instead of plot, 2-dimensional characters, hokey dialogue, awkward story flow (when it flowed at all), and very little suspense where it was sorely needed.  I finally reached my limit when Diana passed out for the hundredth time when she heard the word \\"conception\\".  Really??  Has she not grown at all over the course of 500 pages?  And hello, there has to be sex before there's conception, and at the rate she and Matthew are going I think she'll be past menopause before that happens...  I feel like I should get an award for making it as far as I did.  From what I gather reading other reviews it doesn't even have a proper ending.  And Ms. Harkness thinks I'm going to sit through 600 more pages of this crap for a sequel?!  Think again!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I've always been a fan of Hugh and I know he is very talented with music. I was curious about this type of music so I bought the CD. It has become my boyfriend and I's favorite CD!!! I didn't even know I liked \\"blues\\". I really hope Hugh does another because I will be the first to buy it! If your thinking of buying it just do it, you won't regret it:)
0062515675|4.0|Some people really love this book.  I thought it was good to a point.  The story was a bit drawn out.  I am use to \\"Just the Facts\\" so to speak.  It did keep my attention going but would have taken all of the information on more of a straight forward approach.  It's not a long book so for anyone looking for some insight on how to improve their life, its a good read.    I am always looking for improvment: Spiritually, Physically, Emotionally, etc.
1439193630|5.0|It's not an autobiography but does have some great anecdotes. This is an excellent book on writing for all writers.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|This special edition is great for fans of Disney, cat lovers, or fans of the classic movie. It's great for kids who love animals and is a great family film that everyone can enjoy. The special features are not spectacular by any means, but the main focus is on the movie. It has been restored and looks very pretty. I enjoy this movie and will for years to come.
B005G4TJI4|2.0|20 dollars and 2 1/2 hours I can never get back. I was disappointed by this movie I am actually embarrassed I bought it last Friday when it came out. My kids were so excited but after 2 hours even they had enough. During the scene where the building is crashing down My 9 year old asked What did Optimus Prime go on a lunch break? Once he did show up he made short work of the bad guys.  The action scenes were amazing at first but became boring and tedious real fast. Shia LeBeouf is awful, his stupid jokes always seemed to come at the most inappropriate times. John Turturro's character may be the most stupid, intelligent character in a movie ever. No character development, no real emotion and Transformers that in many scenes never even fought back. If you have to rent it skip the first 45 minutes, but don't buy it it's just not worth it.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|This movie is a classic that will be a classic forever after. In this adventerous comedy, Mike Meyers portrays an independent and moody ogre with his own sense of humor. He plays the part perfectly. Cameron Diez portrays the character of Princess Fiona, a girl with a rough and tough lifestyle, with a big secret. She plays the part very well. Donkey, the funny, cute, and witty little donkey with a big mouth, it portrayed by Eddie Murphey and is perfectly executed.<br /><br />This movie is very funny, and combines all types of comedy in one. The graphics are very good for a movie as old as Shrek is. This movie is an instant classic and is great for family movie night.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Just got this got this delivered by UPS and could not wait to listen to it. So here I sit at work with the CD playing softly All I can say is WOW!!! What a great job he has done on this CD. There is not a song on here that is bad. And I have to many favorites already to choose just one.  Way to go Scotty and I'm sure we will hear alot from you for years to come.
0767840135|5.0|This movie is very cool, in that you get to see the upclose version of the all-man circus. The acts are all very original and fun as well as thrilling. The circus even has a backstory to it that brings all the components together for a fantastic journey through the world of an ordinary girl who meets some odd and interesting things along the journey.
B005974CNA|5.0|When I first heard of Mike Portnoy leaving Dream Theater I was very sad to the point that my favorite band that I have been listening to for almost 20 years was going to be no more. I was very impressed with how the rest of the members stepped up and took initiative on moving on. They started to work the social networks and still do to this day. I honestly feel that is was best for Mike P. to leave since he obviously needed some time away to focus on himself and what he wanted to do with his life. I think that he is happier now with all the projects that he has been working on. On the other hand, DT went forward full steam and auditioned a lot of great drummers and ultimately chose Mike Mangini. I knew of Mangini but did not really know how he would fill the gap that was left in DT. I of course purchase all of DT albums when they come out and listen to them over and over. I have yet to get tired of any of their music. Each song has great parts and when you look at all of music together it all completes who Dream Theater is. I have always respected them for the technical and border insane riffs that make up the DT sound.<br /><br />This album does not let down. I have continuously listened to it daily since it came out and still cannot get enough. I just saw them in concert in Seattle on 9/27 and was blown away. It was the best concert that they have ever given in Seattle and I understand completely now how and why they picked Mike M. He is a monster when it comes to the drums. I think that I like his interpretation of DT better than Mike P. I highly respect Mike P. and hope that he does well, but I really think that he did have some control issues when it came to DT.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album. I think that a true DT fan or any fan of complex, deep, technical music will enjoy. I think of them as modern day classical musicians just like Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, etc., with their complex and technical arrangements.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I would place this a quarter step ahead of the Dresden Files series early books.  This first is by far the most unique, which lends it a bit more oomf than the remainder of the trilogy.  Very well written, very funny, with a depth of language commendable in current literature.  Highly recommended as a light read that encompasses many layers of depth and history.
140053271X|5.0|For all people confused on whether to get a nook or kindle...hopefully this helps!  After hours of researching countless articles and watching reviews, I thought the nook would be the best choice for me.  Turns out I made a great decision! I used to be a strict physical book junkie, but now I enjoy reading both my nook and regular books.  The thing that gets me is that I can bring it practically EVERYWHERE (in the car, doctor's office) rather than bringing my huge hardcover books.  It's really a wonderful product.  Here's some highlights that won me over (before and after):  -After I charged my nook for the first time, the battery lasted about a month before dying, which is really great!  -Light, nice grip to hold  -LOVE the touch screen! When I'm at the gym I just tap on the screen and it's so much easier to read than holding pages on a real book (which I don't mind either)  -Format of the books are awesome, I love how you can see the covers.  -flashes EVERY SIX PAGES!! this feature made the biggest impact on my decision.  I absolutely hated how the kindle flashed on every page.  Huge turn-off for my reading experience.  Things that aren't so good:  -Touch screen freezes randomly (ie. when I accidently highlight something)...but it doesn't happen very often.  I'm not that upset because all I have to do is reboot it and then it works perfectly again.  I'm expecting the system updates will solve that in the near future. I'm pretty sure they are working on it right now!  -ebooks are the same price (sometimes more) than a physical book.  UPDATE (2/19/12)  nook update fixed the freezing!! my nook has been performing beautifully since my purchase in august!! :) i am a happy reader! GET THIS INSTEAD OF THE KINDLE! my friend has the kindle touch and it's way too unorganized.  I love my nook because it still has buttons for those people who can't entirely adjust to an all touch screen device.  For some reason buttons make me feel very comfortable, but I do however use the touch screen every once in a while.  You don't get that luxury with the kindle! I LOVE MY NOOK! After playing around with my friend's kindle (she got it last month), it just reminded me that I made the right decision. yay nook!!  some advice..  -BUY A CASE OFF AMAZON! I got one for like 16 bucks and it's the best case I've ever had.  -Purchase the nook in best buy. They have extended warranties and they are great on customer service. Or you don't have to. Your choice.  So, all I have to say is... I LOVE MY NOOK! It makes me want to read more books because they're so accesible! At first, I was worried I wasted money, but this is truly a fine product. I really can't wait to grow old with it.  hope this helps!  happy reading!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|When I first read Martin's books, I was hooked.  I love the series - the world development and character realism (for lack of a better term) is amazing.  However, this book felt like an attempt at writing a dull history.  Various threads are followed from previous books, nothing really comes to conclusion, and it just feels like a stopgap.  Still very well written technically, but there are terms that repeat, well, repeatedly.  Overall, I feel like it was written in bits and pieces without focus.  I really hope the publishers and author pull it together and do not ruin what could be the best fantasy series in multiple decades.
B0034G4P8A|1.0|I guess im out 20 dollars...cuz i have not received my item and i dont have the option to make a claim in my account.  I was basically ripped off!!
B005COO1X6|5.0|I don't get all of the negative or even mediocre reviews. I was highly entertained and couldn't have predicted the ending. It definitely has a big \\"what the #$%& is going on here\\" feel to it, and I mean that in a good way, and it resolves itself in the end. Well done, Mr. King. I hope you keep pumping out short stories on Kindle!
1594744769|5.0|As with most books I purchase, this one I picked up initially because I thought the cover looked great! When I began to read the dust cover, I immediately knew I had to have it! The story sounded incredibly haunting! A tale unlike any I had ever read before! And that is exactly what this book was!  I don't want to give away too much about the story. I will say it is definately one of my all time favorite books. If you haven't read it yet, you MUST! I have been telling absolutely everyone about this book! It's incredible! It has an amazing story, and I love the way the author Ransom Riggs, tells the story not just through words but also through the use of Vintage Photography. He places the photos throughout the book, in a way that they not only fit in with the book, but also bring the characters to life in such a way that they captivate you!   I wouldn't describe this book as supernatural, paranormal, or anything of that nature. It's really just, incredible story telling! It is about a 17 yr old boy named Jacob, who has grown up to stories his grandfather told him full of monsters and peculiar children. As a child Jacob believed these stories, but the older he got he just thought they were merely that, stories, told by an old man. With the mysterious and quite brutal death of his grandfather, Abe, Jacob soon realizes that there may be something to the tales his grandfather has been telling all these years. Jacob travels to Miss Peregrine's Home for answers. As he digs for answers to his unanswered questions, Jacob becomes entangled in a fascinating world that just may be more than he had bargained for. Full of vintage photography, a love triangle, family troubles, monsters, and peculiar children this is one tale you won't want to miss! If you don't believe me just watch the trailer. You'll be hooked!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie is great. It is one of my daughters favorite movies so I just had to get it. When I ordered I didnt even think about getting it delivered to me on the release date....but it happened anyway :) Great service and great prices from amazon!!
1585673927|4.0|I think \\"right ho\\" is right. Don't yell it in a quiet theater these days, though. LOL. Anyone? Anyway, I really enjoyed this little gem. I listened to it on audio and the narrator was great as well. I go to the library and grab some audiobooks to listen to on my long commute and happened to grab this one. I was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely read more Wodehouse in the future.  I only gave it a four because by the end it was getting a little predictable BUT still charming.

0679642609|5.0|The book Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is neither good nor bad. For good and bad is nothing but a meaningless illusion. This book was well loved by many statesmen; Bill Clion, King Frederick the great etc.  It's popularity is not limited to the western hemisphere. Chinese premier Wen Jiabao professed to reporters during a 2008 press conference that he love this book so much that he have actually read it over for a \\"many\\" times and the book is always by his bedside. As a result, the Chinese translated version became one of the top sellers in China/Hong Kong. How much does the statesmen of our day embracing Marcus Aurelius's teachings and the wisdom of Stoicism is difficult to say. One thing for sure, it is a book that may help to give you the extra ammunition you need to fight your daily battles in a war that can never be won - Life.
0307700879|5.0|Hana the Canadian nurse has cared for the English Patient for four months.  She knows his body as well as a lover would, but knows very little about who he really is.  The Bedouin found him in the Sahara when he ejected from his crashing blazing airplane.  They put out the fire engulfing his body, wrapped him carefully and brought him to the Italian villa where the allies set up a hospital amidst undetonated Nazi bombs.  Now the others have left except for the maniacal nurse and her English Patient.<br /><br />Hana is not concerned with who her English Patient is and what he might have done or even if he is married; as he has given her a reason to live.  Still grieving the death of her father, Hana feels that the unknown burn victim is her family.  However, her idyllic parasite is invaded by thieving spy Caravaggio who was tortured and maimed by the enemy, and Kip the Sikh from India working as a sapper mine detonation expert for the British army in North Africa.  The newcomers feel as displaced by the war as do the Canadian and her patient.<br /><br />This is reprint of one of the most haunting classic war stories ever written.  The story line focuses on displacement of four people who had diverse roles in WWII.  Each character is fully developed coming from different cultures though all are part of the sun setting on the British Empire as the war closes.  All's quiet on the African front, but the aftermath of war remains as volatile as the unexploded ordinance; symbolized by these protagonists who come together over the mystery of whom is the English Patient.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B004UG7RQ0|4.0|I have a JVC radio with an iPod connector. Unfortunately, the DockBoss doesn't work with it. However, I contacted tech support and they were fantastic. They got back with me right away, discussed the problem and sent out a replacement immediately. They also gave me a pre-paid return mailer so I can send them the original one I bought from Amazon. Unfortunately, the replacement doesn't work either and it was determined that it's just not compatible with my JVC connector. I'm bummed b/c I was going to use the DockBoss to keep from having to buy a new Android compatible radio. Nonetheless, big credit to their customer support for being so responsive and helpful during the whole process. I wish more companies were like this.
B00164GDA0|5.0|I only saw this recently. and wondered how I came to miss it for so long. I thought it brilliantly done, with supurb acting and direction.  A group of boys, just coming up to adolescence, hear that another boy has been killed when walking along a rail track; they decide to go on the long hike together to discover the body. This trip leads to a test of loyalty between the boys, and acts as a sort of 'coming of age'. They learn a lot about each other, as they come into conflict with the demons within themselves and demons without, in the form of the teenage  hard guy Ace and his hangers on.   It's based on the novella - called - appropriately enough - 'The Body'. This is one of the few none supernatural stories by Stephen King, who is a good writer in any genre. The film versio is very true to the original, which shows that it can be done.  In a way there are two main characters,Gordon, the narrator, and Chris, who combines being a rebel with unususal wisdom for his age.  They are both neglected at home; Gordon, the unwanted child of aging parents, was always passed over in comparison to his older brother; now that the brother is dead, his parents have become almost catonic, and it is fear that he will neglect his imaginative gift that leads Chris - young as he is - to play the part that Gordon's parents should, and urge him to keep on writing and making up stories.  Chris, who comes from a family generally viewed as no good, is both compassionate and tough, but his whole air convinces bigoted adults that he is 'no good'. Typically, when the school milk money went missing, it was Chris who got the blame,  and not the teacher. He knows already how unfair life is.  Teddy and Vern, lively but unthinking and dismissed as 'feebs' by Gordon's father, are already doomed to a life of small town failure.  Set  in 'Castle Rock' a small town of the late 1950's, the slang, assumptions, and air of that era are casually demonstrated.   Despite the fact that there are no strong female parts (an aspect of the story that always disappointed me) I still think it deserves five stars. You can almost feel the heat of that summer's day, and the throb of the coming train on that railway bridge...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an excellent book for young adults and adults alike. This is a heartbreaking, funny, tear-jerking, coming-of-age story in Nazi Germany with an incredible narration by Death (meaning the Grim Reaper). I would recommend this book to anyone.

B005C5A6C0|5.0|In much the same aspect of the Metallica masterpiece \\"...And Justice for All\\", \\"Unto the Locust\\" follows the awarded metal album of the decade \\"The Blackening\\" with and onslaught of fury and power that is not heard by many other bands circulating in today's metal. This CD is perfectly constructed from start to finish and displays just the various technicalities of the band. The harmonizing vocals, the blazing guitar and drum work of \\"This is the End\\" mixing with to the simply overwhelming heavy grooves and speed of \\"I am Hell\\". I must say that each track has its own beautiful feel and just helps to display how innovative and progressively learning this band is even as they approach 20 years. Machine Head is making the best music in metal and has been consistently for their last 3 albums. \\"Unto the Locust\\" IS NOT \\"the Blackening\\" nor does it try to be but should go down as yet another masterpiece by the one and only Machine Head!!  \\"I am Hell\\" (10/10)   This song is such an amazing way to begin the album. The latin \\"Sangre Sani\\" chanting at the start gives an interesting flow to the song leading up to the brutal, overpowering \\"I AM\\" pre-verse. Rob's voice in this small section sounds like nothing he has done before and the over dub fits perfect. The main riff is just as catchy as in many of their other album openers but is still completely refreshing in it's own right. The duration of the song follows this same riff and comes to a close with some one of Machine Head's heaviest breakdowns before the outro fades to the next song. This is nearly a perfect way to introduce people to \\"Unto the Locust.\\"      \\"Be Still and Know\\" (9.5/10)  \\"Locust\\" (10/10)  \\"This is the End\\" (10/10)  \\"Darkness Within\\" (8.5/10)  A fantastic song, and if you are more of a lyrical listener, this may be your favortie song on the album. The somewhat less intense flow and impact of the song is a nice change of pace from the bone crushing onslaught that is the rest of the album. the harmony and andpassion with the lyric focus makes this a very marketable song but the main purpose behind it as Rob has said implys that Music at times, has been his religion and has pulled him through some of the deepest, darkest parts of his life.   \\"Perals Before the Swine\\" (9.5/10)  \\"Who we Are\\" (9/10)  As this song begins, most would probably be skeptical of the chorus begin sung by a group of kids. However, I think that it is one of the coolest things for some of the guys to incorporate their children in the \\"outro\\" of the album and in a song that implys such inocence. After the initial children's choir (on a Machine Head album!), the main riff picks up and grabs your attention in a \\"Farwell to Arms\\" type fashion. You are seriously hooked from the main beginning. It is a great way to exit the album with!  Extras:  \\"The Sentinel\\" (8/10)  \\"Witch Hunt\\" (8/10)  \\"Darkness Within (acoustic)\\" (8.5/10
069111966X|5.0|This is a great book about mathematics and mathematical problem solving (and, to some extent, problem solving in general).  There are many great ideas for teachers of mathematics, particularly those who teach in high school.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Great movie.  I like it more everytime I see it.  I think it was one of those rare movies where all the ends come together.  The only down side is, I wish it had more special features, but liked what it did have.  I was more impressed with the girls after watching the special features about the sound track.  Plenty of sci fi/fantasy action in the movie, not a lot of blood or bad words either.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I am soo loving Mr. Alex O Loughlin as Steve Garrett. Among all teh cops shows he is the only one for some reason brings authenticity of being an ex Navy Seals. Either he was in the force before or he is just one fine and excellent actor. I salute this show... More season to come please...
0307946711|3.0|The book and the bookcase were sent to me together yesterday. They were wrapped in one narrow box. In order to squeeze the book into that box, the deliveryman violently fold it. So, the book is badly damaged. I dont want to return it, because its not the bookseller's fault, but I'm so pisssed off about it. This is the first unfortunate thing I experienced after I came to the US. Damn.

B002JVWRAO|4.0|As many other reviewers, I have been a long time fan of this show. I remember watching the very first episode on the WB (originally because I was a Jared Padalecki fan and would have watched anything he starred in) but then I found a new love for this show. I loved the ideas, the characters, Jensen Ackles, and the overall message of family. I have followed this show ever since and it is by far my favorite! This season I thought though, lost a little bit of it's essence... I did think there were plot holes and many times that the characters acted out of character.   (May Contain Spoilers)  My biggest issue overall with season 5 was that for this entire time, and entire series why did the brothers start hunting? For their dad. Why did they continue hunting? For their dad. And they looked up to him, at least Dean did, and Sam finally accepted that the whole reason that his dad did what he did and raised them how he did was to protect them and that he did the best that he could. Now it seemed like this mentality was kept through all of the seasons, a sense of utter love and respect for their father... even through part of season 5, when Sam and Dean travel back to the past to prevent Anna from harming them, Sam tells John (even though John doesn't know Sam is his son) he understands why his dad did everything he did and that he did the best he could.   But then when Castiel has given up hope in God towards the end of the season, Dean continuously says he knows what Castiel is going through because he knows all about \\"dead beat dads\\"... he lost all sense of respect in his voice and I'm not sure why. Maybe I missed something going through the seasons but there is no reason that Dean should have turned like that.  I thought it was very out of character. Also it was a hard season to get through because in all the other seasons, no matter what Sam and Dean go through, they go through it together and they suffer and they succeed, together. But this season their relationship was extremely strained until the last few minutes of \\"Swan Song\\" it was like they were brothers that loved each other again. It was a hard season to get through without the reassurance of family like all the others had. Sam couldn't do anything right, and Dean didn't have a problem letting him know it.   Plot holes- now many other reviews have specifics in the plot holes they found, but I just found that the storyline was really jumbled. And I know that everyone has mentioned the idea of anti-climactic ending which I will agree with, but was I still moved by the ending? Yes. But I also know that the show was supposed to end with that season (or I had previously heard they were planning for only four seasons) and though I adore the show, I think if the ending would have been done right and there were no limits (aka killing off one or both of the boys permanently) that it may have done the show justice. Though I hate to say that, and being an English major and fiction writer has taught me that killing off a character is a cop-out ending, if a show is doing an apocalypse plot, there is bound to be one or more main character death. It's just frustrating to see how easily the characters get brought back to life, why kill them in the first place?   That being said, I still didn't feel cheated out of anything really, I still love the show and I still appreciate the actors' dedication to the show.   Also can I just say I love every episode the Trickster (aka Gabriel) is in?!?! They are my all time favorite. From the \\"Dean we don't have time for any of your blah blah blah blah...\\"  to \\"Sam Winchester wears makeup. Sam Winchester cries his way through sex... Sam Winchester keeps a ruler by his bed and every morning he... okay enough!\\"  I think the best quotes come from those episodes, and the one this season was just as funny. I try to keep a lighthearted attitude when watching, and I try not to judge too hard because there are millions of loose ends and overall it's still thesame show we all know and love. I think this season has had a lot of issues, but like I said I don't regret getting it and it still remains my favorite television show ever.   I think as long as you don't watch it trying to find little mistakes and trying to pick apart everything, if you still love the boys then you will still enjoy this season.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I own a local business, and I have to say...when I saw the commercial for this app, I was shocked and disappointed with Amazon.  The commercial shows people shopping in local stores, scanning UPC's, and then buying on Amazon, rather than supporting their LOCAL economy.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|It seems like I waited for three or four years for another Reacher book. Well it was worth the wait- again. I read a lot of books (I am retired) and I read mostly mystery and history. I'm on my second Kindle. Lee Child is one of my favorite authors and the series is one of my favorites as well. I agree that some of them seem a little far fetched for all of the convenient twists and turns. This time the twists and turns were just what I would expect from the US Army that I was a member of. I would like to see even more of the books go back to his days in the Army and maybe even be set overseas. There is a gold mine of intrigue with just looking at the things that happen in the service to our country. Of course his maverick style would be hampered by military regulation but the internal and external arguments over that could enhance the story as well. If this is your first Reacher novel, I suggest strongly that you still go back and read them in the order they were written. And if you have as much trouble trying to find copies of the older ones as I did before they all got on Kindle you will appreciate the convenience of your Kindle even more.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I get that they are George Lucas' movies and I suppose he can do whatever he wants with them....but why? Why change the classics? Does George Lucas go through his parents' scrapbooks and alter his childhood drawing because he can do a better job now? The old movies were the pinnacle of special effects for their time...don't go back and change them every few years to try to make them look like the freaking Matrix. My personal opinion is that despite all the advances in CGI, the CGI looks a lot more like I'm watching a cartoon and the old carefully created models used in the original trilogy looked far more realistic than the stuff in the prequals. If there is such a need to go back and fix things in the movies...why not fix the ridiculous dialogue in Attack of the Clones? Why not get a professional writer(or hey..any High School drama student) to rewrite the interactions between Padme and Anakin?  My bottom line is this...I don't care if George Lucas re-releases and changes the movies every 6 months until he dies.....I just want there to be an unaltered Bluray release as well. I'm sure there will be one eventually because there is certainly a demand for it, but until there is one I will not watch or buy this Bluray release. When the unaltered classics are available, I will watch them and this current release and update my ratings. For now George Lucas gets 1 star for spitting on the hardcore fans and my childhood memories yet again.
1423140591|4.0|Excellent read!  The book flowed fantastically and Riordan really has improved his writing skill since the days of \\"The Lightning Thief.\\"  I was not able to put the book down for the entire time I was reading. The book has some obvious challenges, being the 2nd of 5 books, however Riordan stands to the challenge well and does a good job by allowing this adventure to be (mostly) stand alone, while fleshing out character's and plot for subsequent books.  Our new characters, Hazel and Frank are amusing narrators who are fully capable of bring in new perspectives to the 7 Demigod team.<br /><br />My main complaint is that this book clearly does follow Riordan's typically outline (get quest, work under time constraint, travel the world/USA, get into trouble along the way, save the day) and, after reading the Percy Jackson Series and the Kane Chronicles, this can get a little repetitive.  Despite this predictability, I still find Riordan's writings incredibly entertaining and it is always exciting to learn which geographical locations and Greek/Roman gods he will bring in next.<br /><br />I am excited to say that the series as a whole looks like it is headed for an excellent conclusion.  When Riordan started this series I was initially worried that the series could only be an underdeveloped disappointment.  However, upon finishing the second book I have become optimistic about the series.  The characters and series plot is growing to be well developed, original, and interesting.<br /><br />As a warning to any readers:  the book has a very frustrating cliffhanger!  I was very disappointed when I realized I had just finished the book.<br /><br />My largest complaint, as I think someone has already noted, is that the Kindle version is filled with unnecessary typos and errors.  While this isn't reflected in my star ratings since it doesn't reflect Riordan's writing, it was extremely disappointing that Amazon published such a low quality adaptation. UPDATE: Amazon has re-released the text without the typos!
0439796636|5.0|This book was written for children, but it is a lovely, old fashioned story with an age old message-----the cruelty and waste of war.  It is also about love. Quick and easy read, but if you will need to decide if you want to know the story before the movie comes out in December.

B0041KKYCY|1.0|I'm not sure what is more disturbing; this film or the fact that there are people who rant and rave about how good this movie is.  I saw the original years ago...it was a mediocre exploitation rape film that was pretty bad.  This is simply a remake of the same.  There is a long rape scene, that if you include the first assault, accounts for about 25 minutes of the film.  Sadly, alot of the fans on here were probably turned on by the scenes they were watching, which is pathetic.  The second half of the film is the victim getting her revenge on her rapists after they think she is dead.  She kills them in very unique and creative ways; very unbelievable and unlikely.    Think about how bad the Saw films got after the first one or two, and take that a step further.  Little plot, lots of gore and just a prolonged rape scene.  There was nothing artistic or novel in this film.  I ask all the fanboys this...if this is more than just a rape movie, then take out the rape scene, just have it implied in the plot that she is raped...what do you have left?  Don't watch this film, its really not worth even wasting one of your Netflix rentals and don't expect to see this on TV.  The only people who could like this film are sick, twisted individuals who fantasize about rape.

B005D1IFUS|5.0|Note to Eric Sardinas fans-Don't hesitate on buying this one-it's excellent! For those of you who really don't know much about Eric Sardinas, and you like your blues hot-Buy this disc-you'll become a fan...    How do I describe Eric Sardinas and his playing? How about vintage guitars with an unmatched tone-the dobro and steel guitar sure can sound sweet (which it does in places on the disc), but in Eric's hands IT CAN ALSO THROW FLAMES!! I have to admit that I worry about his guitars, and hope that they don't fall apart; I'd think that they're golden...    Back to the new disc, Eric does a great job on this one, covering the full emotion of what tunes he does, from Delta to full-out hot blues are on this one. I have to rate this one right up there with Devils Train as a favorite (though I do like them all). And lastly, thanks Eric for making the tunes radio friendly in length, this helps me make more folks Eric Sardinas fans....
0525423281|4.0|I spent months dying to read this book and signing up for any and every ARC contest I saw out there in order to get this book before release. I wasn't so lucky so I had to wait until the book actually released to read it. I figured all good things are worth waiting for, and if Anna and the French Kiss was any indication of Stephanie Perkins' genius, then I knew for sure that I would love this book just as much. I was right, it was worth the wait.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is the companion novel to Anna and the French Kiss. Lola Nolan is a very unique, very talented, girl who lives in San Francisco, has two dads, dresses in costume every day, and has for a next door neighbor the dreamy Cricket Bell. We are introduced to Lola as she talks about her peculiar situation living with the two men that adopted her, her outrageous outfits and wigs she wears on a daily basis and her not-so-conventional relationship with her much older rocker boyfriend Max. Her happy thoughts are interrupted one day by the sight of the neighbors moving in next door, which are in fact the same neighbors she has had since childhood, only they moved away two years ago and now have moved back, the Bell twins.<br /><br />Enter the Bell twins, Cricket and Calliope Bell. Calliope a superstar figure skater who is headed to the olympics and Cricket her twin brother who lives in her shadow. Cricket has always had a special bond with his sister Calliope and has always supported her with her figure skating career but Calliope can't see beyond her own little perfect world and fails to acknowledge that Cricket needs to live his own life too. When Cricket sets his sights on Lola, Calliope feels threatened and sabotages their budding relationship. The Bell twins then have to move away due to Calliope's practice schedule and leave Lola more confused than ever.<br /><br />As time passes, Lola moves on and meets Max, a rocker who also happens to be 22 years old, 5 years older than Lola. The age difference makes for some really uncomfortable situations between Lola's dads and Max and also between Lola and Max herself. Lola is in love with Max and Max in love with her, but he is also insecure and possessive. When the Bell family moves back next door to Lola and totally throws Lola's life into a tailspin, Max becomes even more possessive and enraged at the thought of Lola's feelings for Cricket coming back.<br /><br />Lola and Cricket's relationship after Cricket moves back is totally sweet and swoon worthy. Cricket confesses to Lola that he likes her, has always liked her, and Lola finds out that the event that happened 2 years ago to separate them, was fabricated by Cricket's twin sister, Calliope. As readers we bear witness to the growing love between Lola and Cricket and the angst and sweetness of a forbidden love. As they try to convince themselves that they are just friends, I found myself talking to the book and saying \\"oh please, you know you love HIM\\".<br /><br />As a bonus for Stephanie Perkins fans like myself, we also get some Anna and St. Clair moments. Anna happens to be Lola's manager at the movie theater where Lola works part time and St. Clair happens to be friends and live in the same Berkeley dorm as Cricket. They play an important part in the Lola and Cricket drama and are just as charming and totally in love as in Anna and the French Kiss. I highly recommend this book. It's definitely a sweet, adorable, story that will have you clamoring for more. Stephanie Perkins really knows how to get her readers engaged and her style of writing really flows.

1846144132|5.0|I picked up this book when visiting the British Museum in July 2011.  Now I wish I had waited and bought it form Amazon instead of lugging it around!  Truly happy to see it for sale in the U.S.  I am recommending it to my friends.  Each chapter highlights a different item from the museum's collection.  The chapters are quick reads.  I find it fun to pick it up and read a chapter at random.  A nice book to leave hanging around for guests to browse through as well.  It is thick, though, not a big coffee table book.  Generally, a nice collection of writings on a broad range of interesting museum pieces.
B000B7QCKO|5.0|this is the best concert he ever produced.  the rest are not as good as this one..  very good sound and video
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|So yes it is a little early, as the album just came out, but there is a sincerity in his voice and the way he sings that can be compared with George Strait.  It is the reason why George has had multiple singles all through his career.  Scotty to will prosper if he keeps the roots true, sings honest, and perfoms the way he knows how.  He will always be loved if he does this.  I find it refreshing that of all the product to come out of American Idol, The biggest is Carrie underwood, and possibly the next will be Scotty and Lauren Alaina.  It will be the song choice and style that makes or breaks them and this album shows some real potential already.  Time did it for Underwood and can be good to Scotty if success doesnt put his head in the clouds.
037582913X|4.0|Being the father of five children (my wife pregnant with twins), we have many books that rotate in and out of their lives; however, there is only one book that is continually requested at bedtime. To date this book, which was also mine as a child, is barely holding together. The pages are frail and the back cover is missing from years of enjoyment and use. The timeless book is called, \\"The Monster at the End of this Book\\" written by Jon Stone and stars lovable, furry old Grover from Sesame Street.  As stated previously there are many children's books in our library; but, this one seems to have captured their hearts the most. I believe this is the case because the book does an exceptional job of breaking the fourth wall and bringing the reader into the story.  Upon opening the beginning of the story Grover asks the question, \\"What did that say? On the first page (referring to the book title), what did that say? Did that say there will be a Monster at the end of this book??? IT DID? Oh I am so scared of Monsters!!!\\" Already the reader is captivated; feeling like Grover is speaking directly to you. From the first page the fourth wall is immediately broken and Grover has invited us into his world instead of readers being mere observers of his story.  The following page Grover exclaims his fear of monsters and pleads the reader not to turn any more pages. He determines that if pages stop being turned then it will be impossible to reach the end of the book; not bad problem solving for a Muppet. After his plea you reach what is now the third page in the book. Here Grover is in a shouting stance, arms over his eyes and the words YOU TURNED THE PAGE; are largely written with multiple exclamations. This is the moment in the story where my children giggle with laughter that Grover is so distraught over the book being read. The remainder of the book continues this formula. He pleads with the reader not to continue and does everything from tying pages together with rope to building a brick wall to stop the reader from continuing. With each turn of pages poor Grover shouts in fear that the end of the book will be reached and the children laugh harder and enjoy seeing his typical over-the-top reactions with each failure to stop the book from being read.  When the end of the book is finally reached after all of Grover's antics.....well I guess you will have to discover that on your own.  The Monster at the End of this Book is a captivating story. It has a unique plot and focus of writing. The banter that happens between Grover and the reader is unlike anything that has been written before or since. It keeps readers wondering what really is at the end of the book and furthermore it is fun to watch Grover come up with new schemes to stop the reader from continuing. His reactions are typical of his character on the television show and the ways words are written when he is frustrated are smart. For example, Grover cries out, \\"YOU TURNED ANOTHER PAGE! You do not know what you are doing to me! Now STOP TURNING PAGES!\\" This text alone conveys his frustration coupled with fear; however, the choice to add large yellow and orange colors to his words with lightning bolts stemming from his dialogue cloud truly show the children his anxiety in reaching the end of the book.  On the other hand, this book is not much of a read. Totaling 12 pages (most being large font), one will find the book will fly through in less than five minutes. What I have personally discovered is that the children who know how to read, find the book disinteresting once they acquire the reading skill. However, children who cannot read find it hilarious and the pages eye catching, this also means an adult is needed to read the story for them. Again, this means the book is completed in a matter of minutes. My four year old son adores this book the most. He and I usually do two to three readings of it in a single setting. Again because of the shortness of the book he enjoys reciting thebook back to me on the third go around, all from memory.  The other downside is that the book has challenging words in it which deter young readers. Words such as embarrassed, terrible and understand are used. It proves that the book is written for entertainment purposes only and is not written to educate or meet its reader's level of comprehension. When a young reader gets to an age of finally being confident in their reading (around age six) those words used frequently in the book become too difficult and it makes them not want to continue the story. It also causes the book to come to a sudden halt when the large eleven character words arrive. This makes the reader pause, try to sound out the words and eventually results in asking a parent what that particular word is.  Overall, this is a very unique and entertaining book. It has captured hundreds of children (such as myself) since it was originally authored more than 20 years ago. The book does an amazing job of pulling the reader in by making them feel the story is progressed by their hand. It is a very smart and a very fun book to read with children, especially if you can master a Grover voice. The downside is the larger words and duration. Truth be told, I am not sure there is anything I would specifically change because although intimidating to younger readers it really is a lot of fun to experience. It may not be a book that has the educational seal of approval; but, it is a perfect book to show children the joy and value books can bring. It is remarkable at capturing imagination and letting the readers be the ones to experience Grover's world. From the first page, one can't help ask the protruding question, what is the monster at the end of the book?
B003JYOFIW|3.0|It sounds like they're trying to hard to sound like Devo. Earlier albums had more socio-political commentary and this one sounds like it's just  Devo Party Rock. It lacks the depth I've come to expect from them. Lyrically, it's just chanty. Like something AC/DC would write: A few words  repeated ad nauseum in each song. I listened to it for the last few months hoping it would grow on me, but sadly, it has not.  Musically, I don't hate it, I would just prefer the songs to be about something. But maybe that's the point. Something for Everybody has to be watered-down treacle in order to appeal to the masses.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|They did it again with this one. The movie was great, just what you would expect from the series. They go a little more over the top with some of the things the cars can do in this film, but who cares. If you wanted to see a realistic movie about driving cars or grand theft auto then you knew before you saw this film that it wasn't for you. I highly recommend this film and can honeslty say that if you truely enjoyed any of the others you will enjoy this one too. The Blu Ray picture is amazing and well worth the extra money.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is the next evolution in touch typing and I think it's better than swype. Swype is interesting and it came with my EVO, but SwiftKey actually learns from you and its word prediction works more accurately. Plus swyping uses one thumb, and for those users that type with two they can usually get it done faster. So SwiftKey feels better and more natural.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Anybody who loved this movie years ago when it was released, should definitely buy it on blu-ray.  The colors are much more vibrant and the audio is much better.  This is by far one of Disney's best movies, and it's even better in 3D.    Probably the greatest thing about this Diamond edition is that Disney decided to leave out the extra \\"Morning Report\\" song, that had initially been included on the Platinum edition that was released a few years ago.
B005LMEB8E|5.0|Before the release of her song \\"Skyscraper\\", I was not a Demi Lovato fan.  I thought she was just some cheesy Disney singer, but after the release of that song, I began to look at her differently.  She is maturing as a person and as an artist, despite what some of her old fans have said.<br /><br />Her new album is filled with music that shows how wise her real life problems have made her while it also is allowing people to see that she is still young and full of fun and vibrance.  Being able to show two completely different styles off with such grace, energy, and raw talent is admirable for any artist, but for one so young it is just amazing.  This album is definitely one of the best albums that I have listened to this year.<br /><br />About the only issue that I had with the album is that it seemed like most of the fast, dance-oriented songs and compilations were on one end of the album.  That decision by the producers or record company made it a little hard to tell the difference between some of the songs.  I guess I could have knocked a star off for that, but I didn't because I just truly enjoyed the album.
034552554X|5.0|I loved this story, and I have to admit mostly because of the flower language element. I was so fascinated by that concept, and romantic idea and even more so fascinated by the fact the language exists. I loved the characters and the psychological struggles some of the characters go through, especially the main character. I am not normally a reader of romantic themed books, but this has enough diverse elements to it that the romance was secondary and not cheesy. I will look forward to more from this author.
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin's study of Lincoln's Cabinet and what made them who they were is not only an important look at a critical era in America's history, it is gossipy, personal, and a good read.  Stodgy-looking \\"dead white guys\\" jump to life with their passions, personal struggles, and vision for America.  The miracle was that these rivals for Presidential power ended up pulling together to save the Union and to admire one another.
0547791097|5.0|Very different than the movie.. the driver is a much more intriguing character. This novel pops with the sorrows and beauty of los angels...and life astray.
0785139168|4.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice really comes to life in the graphic novel adaptation done by Nancy Butler and Hugo Petrus. The Illustrations are really nice and eye catching. The graphic novel is really quite faithful to the original novel too. I think it is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's writings for young people, though it is not a substitute for the whole text.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Overall, reading this graphic novel was an enjoyable experience.
0307595862|5.0|The seventh installment featuring Nesbo's antihero police detective, Harry Hole, shows us again why he is the current reigning Scandinavian author writing for American audiences.<br />By using the US presidential elections to establish a timeline for his latest novel Nesbo immediately establishes a rapport with his American audience and makes this a truly international novel, so much that we forget he has us running around the streets of Oslo not New York, so we can concentrate more on the storyline.<br />And what a story! Hole, the recovering alcoholic, as usual strikes out on his own, following a path of investigation that only he seems to understand, a veritable Norwegian Colombo, with the exception that he is tall, blonde energetic, he does however have the subtle power to interpret the clues that others squander. Hole is the dragon-chaser, seeing serial-killers where Norway never has. Serial-killers are an American phenomena in the police world and Hole is considered quite barmy for even considering Oslo could entertain one of their own.<br />For several years women have gone missing in Norway, and now both bodies and snowmen are showing up in Oslo. When Hole is assigned a new female partner, Katrine Bratt, a transfer from another department, the two of them discover a link between the snowmen Hole is chasing to one that appeared in case of a missing police detective a decade before and the clues start to fall into place. The fast paced action never stops in the this police procedural that takes you down and around so many thrills, chills and false leads that your head spins.<br />Nesbo's style is persuasive, irreverent and hard-boiled. He takes you places you thought you'd never go and then ties you up and leaves you there alone! Be prepared to wowed.
1451629184|2.0|The first few pages were gripping as you experienced the horror of her abduction.  The rest of the book seemed more like an essay, talking more about her pets than what she went through.  I thought it was a shallow accounting of her experience. I expected more.
0062060554|4.0|Christine wakes in a strange bed, doesn't recognize the room or the man snoring next to her. He has grey-flecked hair and she surmises she must have had a one-night stand with an older man. When she makes it down the corridor to the bathroom and looks in the mirror she has no recollection of ever seeing the middle-aged woman reflected back at her.<br />In answer to her screams her husband Ben shows up and tells her--as he does every day--who she is and how she has amnesia. The photographs surrounding the bathroom mirror show her each day a history of her life so far, and as she relaxes into the day, all is well. She just knows that as soon as she goes to sleep it will start all over again.<br />After Ben has left for his teaching job, the phone rings and a Dr. Nash reminds her to look in the shoebox in her closet. Apparently she has a journal she writes in every day that she keeps hidden from her husband. The first note in the journal is DON'T TRUST BEN! As the novel progresses day by day and we get used to her routine, Christine's life unfolds to us and to her. Gradually her memory increases until she no longer needs a daily reminder of the hidden journal and she begins to have flashbacks of her prior life. When she confronts Ben as to why he never told her of the novel she published or the son she bore, his answers are not glib, they make sense in order to protect her daily fragility.<br />When her flashbacks are of a man in her bed with a beard and a scarred face--definitely not Ben--and memories of a brutal assault, not of the automobile accident she has been told caused her head injuries, Christine begins to question Ben's trust again. Nothing is as it appears and as the reader you should question everything you see and then never go to sleep again!
B003THN75G|5.0|Okay I have watched all three seasons at least ten times each while waiting for season four to start and I have read many reviews about Castle. This series never claimed to be about the expert forensics, the seriousness of the crime committed or the justice of the law and order. From the get go ,it has been about the story......the love story ,between Castle and Beckett. The building up of there relationship and all that they must overcome in order for these two beautiful people to come together, they have already proven how they are there for each other in life and death situations now we are waiting for the earthquake that will surely happen when they get together. And that Det. Beckett is why you are here.

0812973992|5.0|This book is fantastic on every level. Going into it, I thought that this was a collection of short stories. Instead, we follow different characters whose stories are all related, thus adding to a great feeling of connection that strengthens the book and makes it more compelling. McCann also does a great job of speaking in the voices of so many different people from different walks of life. And when he does so, his prose has a kind of poetry within it. Another review called it 'lyrical', and I would say that that is appropriate. But with each different voice used, he must use a different kind of poetic voice. In that sense, McCann does a good job of capturing the inner moments and quiet moments that are better captured in books than in films. But he also does a good job with the specific action of the events of the book, making the reader feel as if he or she were right there watching the events unfold.   I am very glad that I took a chance on this one. It is the best book that I have read in years.
0140540563|5.0|This is a very good book for our 7 year old. He laughed all the way through it. Good books make reading for kids a pleasure and a skill they will likely continue.
B00000258J|5.0|Just wanted to add my two cents worth. I have owned hundreds of blues albums and CD's by dozens of artists. Honestly, maybe a handful are this good, but I can't think of any offhand that are better. Raucous vitality, a wonderful sense of joy and humor, guitar and harp tones that are perfection! And MUDDY!!! This is the electrified blues at its finest. I've never been much of a fan of Johnny Winter, who produced this CD, but I make a big exception in this case. He did a spectacular job.
0805017445|5.0|Brown bear is a classic childrens book.  It can be used to help children identify colors and animals.  As a teacher, I have my students create stories using the repetitive lines.
0553807919|3.0|Being that I was experiencing a particularly difficult time in my child's life (or in mine, depending on your perspective) - the so-called terrible twos - I was hoping that this book might have some magic answers.  It doesn't.  It basically covers the same ground as other parenting books, a combination of, say, Lise Eliot, and the Happiest Toddler on the Block.  The suggestions are hard to implement, as acknowledged by the author, when you have been so pushed to the edge by sleeplessness and tantrums so as to have become a toddler yourself.<br /><br />What I did like about the book were the cartoons and pictures, and the fact that it covers all ages and stages, so I can see myself returning to it.  However, the techniques were spread across all ages all the time, so it was harder to focus in on what might be appropriate for me and my child at this very moment.<br /><br />Overall, I like the general ideas/principles behind the book, but I'm not sure that it stands out in the field of parenting books based on similar research.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|This was not purchased through Amazon, it was a gift from my nephew<br /><br />I have been a fan of Josh Groban since the first time I saw him open his mouth and stun me with his magnificent voice. I have all his CDs except the Christmas one, and have been to his concerts on several occasions (one front row experience). This young man, in my opinion, has a rare gift. Having said that, I found the Illuminations album rather flat and somewhat dark. Not to say that there weren't some good offerings, perhaps his new direction is just not my personal style. I would recommend sampling some of the songs before purchasing so that you can hear and decide for yourself.<br /><br />There were many negative reviews for his Awake CD when it first appeared, although mine was a positive one; I loved the variety and the new side of Josh's personality and choices.Others said it was \\"different\\", not Josh's \\"usual\\", but I think many fans came to appreciate it and I'm sure new fans were made from its release.  Perhaps I'll warm up to Illuminations (however, I don't truly think that will be the case as a whole--rather than having an entire CD of favorites, I may settle for 2 or 3). On the up side, Illuminations may bring in a fan base that has been missing in the past. And whether this is a favorite or not, the voice has matured and is more beautiful than ever.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I like a lot of different kinds of music and I do like country too. This is one hell of a debut album. There is not one dud on it. I hope he will beat the sophmore jinx when it comes time to release his second disc. I hope he has a long long career as he deserves it. This kid can sing. I'm not a fan of American Idol but when I heard him sing I watched and voted like crazy last season.Buy this disc you will not regret your purchase. I hope it hits #1 on the Billboard charts. GO SCOTTY!
0061928356|5.0|shilpigowda<br />This extremely wonderful novel begins with the birth of Usha, an Indian girl. She is born in a part Mumbai. Her name means Dawn. Quickly Usha is taken away to an Indian orphanage. She will grow up not knowing her biological parents. An American family will adopt her and raise her in America. Somer, her mother is Caucassian. Krishnan, her father is Indian. Somer and Krishnan rename Usha, Asha. Throughout her life Asha will always have to make adjustments. It seems like there are many lives to live in this one young woman's body.<br /><br />\\"Asha looks around at a sea of brown faces: some lighter, some darker than her own, but these variations are insignificant in light of the realization she has never been around so many Indians before. For the first time in her life, she is not in the minority.\\"<br /><br />It astonished me how well shilpi somay gowda could tell the story of two families with such creative ease. It made me happy to know I wouldn't just learn about Asha's life in America as if she had been dropped here with a middle but no beginning. The author keeps us informed about the biological family back in Mumbai, India. I had the chance to become closely involved with the lives of Kavita, Asha's biological mother, Jasu, her father and her brother, Vijay. This made me think how all of our relatives and/or ancestors play a part in our life whether we ever meet them personally or don't meet them personally.  Who they are lies within us as much as the blood streaming throughout our veins. What we look like can tell an ancestor's story or the way we move, etc.<br /><br />\\"Do I remember? What, do you think I'm already some crazy old lady who's lost her mind? Of course I remember. You had one little birthmark on your ankle, and another on the bridge of your nose--yes, that one, it's still there. Dadima brushes it lightly with a finger.\\"<br /><br />When Asha arrives at the orphanage, the clerk explains there is no way to tell who brought her there so many years ago. Then, he look in Asha's eyes. He says in so many words I've seen those very eyes before. At that point, he begins to put his heart in searching for Asha's parents.<br /><br />\\"Suddenly, Arun Deshpande leans forward and peers at Asha's face. \\"Your eyes, they're so unusual. I have seen that color only once before on Indian woman.....He shuffles through the files...\\"<br /><br />Also, by  meeting both families I had the chance to learn about life in India. Shilpi Somaya Gowda explains in depth why Baby Asha is taken away to an orphanage. Sadly, there is a gender war in India. Girls are far less important than boys. Shilpi Somaya Gowda uses the term \\"forgotten daughters\\" to describe Indian girls.<br /><br />\\"Although the Indian government outlawed ultrasound for gender indentification purposes a decade ago, the practice is still rampant and often leads to sex-selective abortion, a phrase Asha has never heard before.\\"<br /><br />\\"The third article mentions the infanticide of baby girls, along with bride-burning and dowry deaths, as part of a series on the struggle for women's rights in India.\\"<br /><br />Oddly, Vijay, the son, becomes a disappointment to Kavita and Jasu. While Asha becomes a young woman any parent would proudly talk about to neighbors and friends. Asha becomes a journalist who is able to live two ways of life and in two worlds separated by an ocean. Kavita remains the last person in my mind. I suppose because she started the painful journey for all the others involved in this multicultural drama. She is also the one who brought a different type of joy to each person in the drama. Through her sacrifice others gained so much including herself. She gained a strong marriage and a daughter who would always remember her no matter where her home.<br /><br />\\"EACH OF THE ROUGH STONE STEPS KAVITA CLIMBS BRINGS THE memories rushing back. Though  it has been over twenty years since she shared this house with Jasu, the soles of her feet remember it as if no time has passed at all.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I received this item faster than I expected. I couldn't wait to pop it in and catch up. This show is awesome, it gets better with every episode.
B0058A119G|5.0|I have loved this woman for longer than I can remember.  I don't always agree with her politics, but her voice is beyond compare.  She sings these wonderful songs with such feeling, a few of them brought tears to my eyes.  No one today can bring life to a song like she does, it is very rare.  Her voice and the lyrics of the Bergman's are a perfect combination, so glad they found each other and we can enjoy their collaboration.
1594744769|4.0|While not as endearing as the Harry Potter series or as exciting as the Hunger Games Trilogy, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was nevertheless immediately interesting and entertaining from page one.  Ransom Riggs creates a fascinating world both present and past as the principle travels in time from the present to 1940 to satisfy his questions about his grandfather's mysterious past. He experiences a loop in which time is repeated and meets children with certain characteristics or powers and discovers some intriguing things about himself as well.  The story ends with the hint of at least one more book to come as the children are forced to seek a resolution to the problems encountered as the book reaches its conclusion.  The first half of the book (as told in first person by Jacob, a 16 year old who's grandfather dies at the beginning of the book) develops Jacob's character and establishes the mystery surrounding Jacob's grandfather.  The second half of the book is devoted to Jacob's adventures when he travels to an island off the coast of Great Britain which is so isolated its only form of electricity comes from generators that are turned off nightly. All is serene in the world that Jacob visits where he meets Emma, perpetually at the same age as she was in 1940, who develops a relationship with him.  As Jacob wrestles with the idea of staying in the present or in the world of 1940, the children are threatened by others that seek to destroy them.  I am anxious to find out what happens next and look forward to when the next episode will be available.
B000093FLA|3.0|I'd actually give this 3.5 stars mostly due to the ending and the fantastic performance by Vinnie Jones. The ending (while to some) might be a surprise, over all there isn't a lot of true surprises. With that said, this movie has action, humor and a few twists and turns. If you don't like Guy Ritchie movies, you probably will not like this. Not a traditional action film, it has its moments. While not as strong as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, it still has a place in the \\"should see\\" movie lists. Brad Pitt is surprising good in his roll. He proves that he isn't just a \\"movie star\\" but has acting ability as well. Jason Statham is his usual self (which depending on your view of him can be a very good thing) and Vinnie Jones quietly steals the show as he always seems to!
B003GWLVC0|2.0|I think it arrived 2 CDs short.  I never told anyone or gave them a chance to make me happy.  It was disappointing but I have other stuff to listen to.
0143118706|1.0|I can't even begin to explain how much I disliked this book.  I did give one star because I do believe Gilbert's writing is rather good.  It is the author's neurotic point of view, analysis on the topic of marriage and the need for others to prop her up is what I found nauseating. Just like many other reviewers wrote, Gilbert should perhaps stick to fiction i.e. her craft, the discipline for which she is trained, experienced and gifted in.    I did like EPL like many of us, but we knew this wasn't that because Gilbert prefaces this in the beginning-just as she apologizes for not being a social scientist, etc. and thereby giving her carte blanche to make a mockery of those of us with higher degrees and having done actual research in such fields. There were no references and citation, focus on quantitative research and no qualitative or evaluative research and over use of statistics. If anyone has taken a statistics class you know the numbers are one sided usually.    I really do believe that if you do something well (like winning/nominated for a National Book Award), you should do that one thing even better.  I guess when you are riding the gravy train-money can open a lot of doors for you.  The term \\"selling out\\" comes to mind. Why you ask?  We all thought that Gilbert truly made a self transformation in EPL.  I do not see a bit of that transformed woman in Committed at all.  What happened?  Was it the trend for the moment? I suppose her grocery bags are full yet again and her audience has the inopportunity to witness her rants which sound to me like a series of psychotherapy sessions. Furthermore, her sheer self-centeredness truly disturbed me especially when she was telling us about how she could not understand how her mother sacrificed for she and her sister when in the end her mother is the happiest now with just herself and her husband at home.  Wow.  This woman clearly cannot see past herself, it is all about Elizabeth Gilbert and by the looks of it (accordingto the reviews) most of us feel the same way about ourselves. I guess we live in a hyper self-centered culture and it's OK to be that way because it is being perpetuated in the media and is being woven into the fabric of our existence.  What's in it for me? (Like many other reviewers exclaimed, I hear you).   What happened to letting go, and having faith and trusting that everything will work out just as it's meant to?  All the knowledge in the world is not going to \\"prepare\\" you for marriage.  I like to think that we take chances-falling in love is taking a chance and hopefully you are right and if you are not, you hopefully learn from it-hopefully we are moving forward as human beings and not backwards. Perhaps I am too hopeful?  What I also did not hear in this book, how she has changed (in a positive way) since her first marriage? Learning from our past mistakes, gee that is novel.  Yes, none of that here.   Finally, the feminist piece was annoying because there is a fine line between true feminism and being truly self-centered.  This woman is not being subjugated; she is the epitome of free and with a man who would not want her to be anything but free. Yes, the whole bit about VISAs and being legal and the rant regarding Felipe's alleged deportation.  Unfortunately, that is the way it is-rules are rules and governments should do their jobs regarding immigrants and in this case they did. My point is you can be free and be married at the same time, I can attest to that. The only thing getting in her way is her. I think in the end Gilbert's neurotic fears are what created this book and no earthly power (knowledge), possession or travel experience will protect you from what may happen:  loss, pain, and possibly being wrong...and that my friends is humility-which this book severely lacks. How about some therapy Ms. Gilbert?
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a five star book.  I've only recently become interested in flowers.  The story touches every emotion you have.  Victoria is a real piece of work.  She got guts.  Loved this book.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This was such a good book! It is filled with happiness and sorrow and you feel them both deeply. The phrase \\"If I Stay\\" in the story starts out being about one thing but then turns into something else. If I Stay is filled with music and heartbreak and hope.
B001MIVTVS|5.0|This compilation is the digital re-master of Donovan's 1967 box 2 LP set. I originally received the box set as a Christmas present from my sis in '67. I must admit that I played the grooves out of the old vinyl, so finding that a pristine, re-mastered CD of the set, just as it was sequenced on the old vinyl, was a temptation that I could not resist. No bonus tracks or alternative versions here - just the playlist as it was originally heard, all those years ago.<br /><br />The original box contained two LPs. The first record was dedicated to the \\"flower children\\" that Donovan assumed were finding their way to a new awareness. The second LP was dedicated to \\"Little Ones\\"; the children of the \\"children.\\"<br /><br />For those who might be looking for \\"Sunshine Superman\\", or \\"Mellow Yellow\\", this is not what you are looking for. This is a unique collection that stands all by itself as a monument of a rather strangely beautiful slice of time that came, and went, in the blinking of an eye. And yet, here it is, still.<br /><br />The opening track of the first LP, \\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\", was, I think, the only radio \\"hit\\" that emerged from \\"Gift\\", but it was so many other songs from this set that etched their way into my consciousness. Personal favorites here include:<br /><br />*Skip-Along-Sam<br />*There Was A Time<br />*Oh Gosh<br />*The Land Of Doesn't Have To Be<br />*Someone's Singing<br />*The Enchanted Gypsy<br />*Isle Of Islay<br />*The Tinker And The Crab<br />*Starfish On The Toast<br />*Epistle To Derroll<br /><br />Absent here is much of the original album art and, of course, the folder with individual pages that included the lyrics, along with elaborate illustrations of the songs on the second LP. But how could that find its way into a CD? Some things get lost with the transitions of technology. Give a little, take a little. Or so it goes.<br /><br />But if you enjoy a bit of time warpin', and merging with an ocean world of never was, and yet, just maybe,always has been ... then you will emmensely enjoy this recording. Maybe you had to have been there ... or, maybe not.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The best part about this game, for me, is the aesthetic. The music, sound effects, and visuals all work very well together to create a very relaxing and enjoyable experience. It's not a game that would spend a large amount of time with all at once, but it's great to play periodically for a few minutes at a time.
B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|I am a fairly new Keane fan, and have heard all their albums, eps, and watched most of their videos and youtube performances since they came on the scene in 2004.  Despite the people who say they've changed for the worst, or \\"don't buy this ep\\", I have to say it is has been great fun to watch their progress from Hopes & Fears and to see the increasing strength of Tim Rice Oxley's songwriting and Tom Chaplin's vocals over the years.  I have really enjoyed the music on Night Train and their earlier Perfect Symmetry album.   Why do people want bands to be the same, repeating the same kind of music over and over? We always have the old stuff, and it is great.  Night Train still sounds like Keane to me. Having Tim finally do a lead vocal is a thrill to most ardent fans, because there is a rawness and passion in his voice that is just perfect for \\"Your Love\\".  There are upbeat and even danceable songs here, and Chaplin's vocals are just superb, as always. He grows in confidence and nuance. So if you like Keane at all, don't be shy, dip your toes into what they did on this EP and celebrate it.  Artists progress, they grow, they don't just keep repeating themselves.  Too many negative reviews about this EP for my taste.  And they are working on a 4th album that should be out in 2012. Fans can't wait!!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|The game is awesome brings me back to when Final Fantasy was actually cool. The only problem with the game is the control which is a pain when trying to avoid mobs; but hey its a touch screen so I don't fault the developers for that the games awesome I hope to see a part 2 coming soon and I haven't even beat this game yet.
0439023513|5.0|This book is amazing, a perfect conclusion to the series. It's had me hanging on to every word since the beginning, and I just keep falling in love for the characters and the world that they live in :)
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I had my doubts with this cd. I think Scotty is an excellent singer but the combination of Interscope Records (which has little country experience) and the mediocre \\"I love you this big\\" effort had me worried. Another trap was the thought that with Scotty's young age he may become the Taylor Swift counterpart with songs appealing to teenaged listeners; or even assimilate into the new wave of outlaw or \\"redneck\\" country which promotes drinking, womanizing, and profane subjects.  To our luck, Scotty produced an album true to himself and true to the country genre. It walks the line between overproduced teen-oriented music, overly repetitive pop-country, and the hard living outlaw country currently being overproduced and popularized. The music choices are reminiscent of Josh Turner and Jason Michael Carroll without the heaviness of an older artist's production. It is produced as a believable country hit album with all the key country elements and definitely will be the first steps to Scotty's success.  Out of summertime: 7/10  Catchy tune with an upbeat and fun tone. Love which is passed is discussed without a melancholic tone  I love you this big: 5/10  Slightly better produced and edited on the CD than I have heard on the radio or the television. It still is a bit repetitive and juvenile-oriented but the people on American Idol did produce it afterall...  Clear as day: 8/10  Slower paced song than the previous two and more resembling of a Josh Turner song. A very good addition to the CD, meaningful lyrics and truly country themed song with less repetition and more story.  The trouble with girls: 7/10  This song has a title that forebodes a storyline that is excessively teen-aged and might not appeal to a wide audience; however, it proves that assumption wrong. Easy going song.   Water tower town: 7/10  Song with a good beat and appeal to a country setting, good quality country  Walk in the country: 7/10  Fast catchy paced song with nice imagery  Better than that: 8/10Fun song that promotes a listener to want to sing along  Write my number on your hand: 8/10  An innocent and enjoyable song describing youth  Dirty dishes: 8/10  Another high quality song with many well used country themes and a good story-telling quality  You make that look good: 8/10  Good song to listen to as it promotes a fun free country atmosphere  Back on the ground: 8/10  Song about coming home, excellent story that lyrically paints a quality picture  That old King James: 8/10  The last song providing a good relationship to religion and its ability to provide support and meaning to one's life, Scotty does a good job combining themes and ending the CD with one of his key convictions
B005D9MUWY|3.0|The predictions aspect of this keyboard is pretty good for the most part but I thought that there was supposed to be multitouch on this keyboard. When I press one key then while my thumb is still on a letter and try to press another key the same letter would pop up. Completely not what multitouch means.
1439192812|5.0|I bought this book and had really high hopes for it.  I have not been disappointed.  A quick flick through and the amount of colorful and eye popping illustrations are a wonder.  This book is not only beautifully written (I have not completed it yet and made some significant headway and I only got it today) but beautifully and cleverly illustrated too.  The harmony between the words and art (and I mean ART) is simply wonderful.  It's an easy read, as it should be as it is geared for kids but I must say as an adult it keeps my attention and reminds me of when I was a kid discovering dinosaurs at the library.  Oh how I wish I had this book at that time, but better late than never - it is still a joy to read as an adult.<br /><br />I will be ordering more and giving them as gifts, it will make a great Christmas gift :)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just watched the entire series of Firefly today. It is so sad that this series was cancelled only after 11 or so episodes. I haven't enjoyed a series like this in, well....ever!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Hosseini did it again! He paints a vivid historical picture through the eyes of two endearing women. Their experiences and struggles -- in society and at home -- speak volumes and provide insight into the makings of the harsh Afghanistan that we know today.
B005POK858|5.0|Though this was developed by a different company than Symphony of Eternity, it still makes for one of my two favorite RPG's on an Android. It controls well, looks good and plays well. Couple that with a fair story and decent dialog, you get hours of Android RPG fun!
B000NY12LO|4.0|While the book was one that I couldn't put down, the ending -- which conveniently tied everything up in a neat little bow -- was a bit of a let down.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|The only complaint I have with this game is the sometimes cheesy dialog but I've seen worse in console games. The controls are the gem in the crown of this one. The choice of how you control the game was a smart design choice and I wish more developers would make it.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I am constantly amazed at the usefulness and quality of the scans this app produces. As a student this has become one of the best apps on my phone. It's amazing to be able to copy notes or books on the go without having to run to the pay copy machines at school.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I knew this was a fun game from playing it on friends phones. Now that its on my phone and with me all the time, I can't stop. Help me.
B001RLP862|4.0|These cards are great.  They stand up to use and weather well.  The only issue I've seen is that the print does tend to fade over time/use.  The cards themselves hold up exceptionally well, but you'll notice cracking/fading on the printed face of the cards (specially on black suits, and only on the faces) over time.  As an avid poker player, I'm always looking for high quality cards that can be used in my normal house games.  I don't want to buy a new deck for every game, and for that purpose these cards are great.  They spread well, shuffle well, and feel great.  It's uncanny how similar to regular cards these are (typically with plastic cards there are very noticable differences, but not with these).<br /><br />If you're looking for a deck of cards that look and feel like regular cards, but have the durability of plastic cards - these are the cards for you.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I am very happy with the product I order. Came within estimated dates and was in decent condition. Would order again.
B003274QH6|5.0|I had heard about breaking bad from friends for years, but in my quest to not spend so much time watching TV I resisted for years. I finally broke down and bought the first 2 seasons on blu ray and I can't stop watching them! Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor and I can't wait to catch up on all the seasons (up to season 3 already and I still can't stop watching!!)
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This album is the best of 2011 and very well could be the best of all time, the different styles of each song sets this album apart from all the others. This album is for sure worth buying.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Again, I can't say enoug about this series. It is so well, acted, especially Bryan Cranston, and written that I want to watch the entire season as soon as I start it. Especially in season 2. This season really starts off with a bang! Must see. I'm already on to season 3 2 weeks later and I am purchasing season 4 now so I can finally catch up to this amazing show!
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|I have not watched this DVD all the way thru, but it is a fun movie for kids possible with a side of possible learning possibility's. At least there is no bad language just fun. Not much more to say. If my kids wanted to watch this DVD I would say yes, OK, very well.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great TV Show!<br /><br />I recommend it if you are into the genre, its entertaining and pretty awesome production values (for a tv show). It has some nice extras, but not really that much, just an ok behind the scenes. Oh and  quick \\"how to make your own zombie make up\\" which was actually pretty nice, I hope they do more of those with the next one. The only thing I was a little disappointing was that the \\"entire\\" season is just 7 episodes long, but its still really good.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I have watched this on TV and really enjoyed the movie. Hugh Grant is unemployed just lounging on his couch nothing to do but watch TV and go to the market, Maybe go to some places like parents without partners and see if he can hook up with a woman and of course he does, but he lies about his situation and says he has a kid. He Somehow gets involved with a kid that really has nothing going for himself so he gets attached to Hugh Grant as a father type person. In the end here is Hugh Grant Unemployed with a kid as a friend and one or two women as potential wife's.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I will normally always purchase a lower cost item just because i like a good deal. But when it comes to the Dualshock 3 Wireless controller go ahead and spend the money and get the best controller. I have purchased other controllers by third party manufactures and in the end came back to the Sony brand.   Why?  Controller lag. There is nothing worse than trying to kill someone at just the right second and it takes your controller a extra 5 seconds to actually do what you asked it to do in the first place!   Spend the extra few bucks and get the best controller!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very accurate physics engine with  Great themes. Simple yet challenging, and not to mention that om nom is the cutest character ever.
B000UD0ESA|3.0|As a science fiction fan I love Blade Runner and I have bought and viewed all three versions which include: the director's cut, the final cut and the original narrative version.  In my opinion, they should have left the original version ALONE, because all they did was ruin the film by attempting to revise the film to suit their own egos.  Without the narrative, someone viewing the film fails to understand the inner thoughts of the character, which is vital to the purpose of the film.<br /><br />I have also read the original book this movie was based on and if they wanted to actually improve the film, they could have shown (Decker) Harris Ford taking the test himself, thus, finding out he was not a replicant.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am sure many Blade Runner fans disagree with my review, but after personally talking with at least five Blade Runner fans, they all agree the original version is still the best.<br /><br />Rating:  3 Stars.

B004EPYZQM|5.0|I am a big Fast and Furious fan as well as a fan of Dwayne Johnson. I put that out there first so as to make you aware of my bias. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I did not get to see it in the theatre so watching it on Blu-Ray was my first viewing of this. Parts that stand out and it is noted in one of the Extras, they try and succeed in establishing a deeper family aspect with the crew. That and fantastic action scenes does not leave the watcher of this bored at all.  BLU-RAY QUALITY: 4.5 STARS - Seen better but it was on par with the other movies and a good viewing.   STORY: 4.5 STARS - I like how they brought everyone back together and the story was alright. It definitely followed the franchise.  SPECIAL EFFECTS AND ORIGINAL ACTION: 5 STARS - The opening train heist scene was fantastic and the end Vault chase was amazing.  BLU-RAY EXTRAS: 4 STARS - I enjoyed the extras. Little insights to different parts of the movie. Good actor interviews. Good interactions with the director and extra behind the scenes cast. I have not watched the Director Commentary or the Theatrical Version. The Extended Version was good but no idea how much \\"extra\\" was included.  THE ROCK: 4.5 STARS - I have to rate the Rock individually because I am a fan. This character was a bit out of place and The Rock's performance adds to that. I did like his portrayal of his character.   OVERALL FEELING: I rate this 5 stars because as I stated, I like the Fast and Furious franchise and this was my favorite so far. Really I rate this 4.5 stars but with no .5 in Amazon I push to 5 stars as I will watch this again and likely watch the director commentary.
B000E2AZ2C|5.0|As I mentioned previously in my review of the two-disc final cut edition, this narrated 10th anniversary edition is the best version of Blade Runner.<br /><br />This edition gives a positive ending rather than the \\"doom and gloom\\" endings of the other editions.  May be I am a romantic, but with this ending, one could have easily written another Blade Runner movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, in my opinion, as well as several of my science fiction friends, the narrated version is still the best version of them all.<br /><br />Rating:  5 stars  Joseph J. Truncalde (Author: Season of the Warrior: A Poetic Tribute to Warriors)
B005LAJ1CC|5.0|A documentary on a music celebrity can be measured by content and insight - what footage did they access and who was willing to contribute and what new light did it shed on the subject? On the first point Martin Scorsese knocks the ball out of the park. Though I didn't feel I knew George any better than before by the end, I was treated to nearly four hours of dazzling and emotionally moving entertainment.<br /><br />I watched both parts of the film at UK preview and at no point did my attention or enthusiasm flag. In fact I would have happily sat through any outtakes! This beautifully crafted film is packed with concert footage, home movies, press conferences, interviews, photos and documents that I've never seen before, even though I've been researching the Beatles quite heavily for several years for Beatles Songwriting Academy. There are interviews with (or at least footage of) everyone you would hope to see. Beatles, wives, brothers, son, Pythons and peers. Everyone from Eric Clapton to Eric Idle.<br /><br />The documentary is constructed entirely from interviews and clips without explanation or analysis. The closest we get to a voiceover is Dhani Harrison reading excerpts from his father's diary and letters to his mum. Though the film is visually stunning it's strange watching the practically square picture forced upon us by the source material. Equally quirky is the sound editing. Scorsese doesn't know the meaning of 'fade'. All the music cuts brutally, sometimes after a few seconds. Sometimes this is cool. Mostly it's odd. The film is largely chronological and there are some great juxtapositions of sound and visuals like All Things Must Pass accompanies footage of the WW2 bombers that plagued the Liverpool of Harrison's birth. The first part covers George's life up to the White Album.<br /><br />It's hard to pick out favourite parts. But Harrison's obvious delight watching archive footage of the Beatles miming This Boy, laughing and singing along, is one. The Beatles performing If I Needed Someone, Harrison playing What Is Love? with Billy Preston, and seeing the Travelling Wilburys in the studio would be others.<br /><br />There are moments of laugh out loud humour, especially TV footage of crusty professors discuss the significance of Pop music while Beatles and Mick Jagger seeth like captive wild animal in the background and Tom Petty recounting Harrison arriving at his house with a trunk full of ukeleles. But Harrison's story of how Lennon and McCartney inspired him to start composing is the best - \\"If John and Paul can write [songs] everybody must be able to\\". The Maharishi (a spiritual Joe Pasquali) and Phil Spector (a croaking, unblinking vision of craziness with a permanent twitching thumb) also provide some unintentional humour.<br /><br />Scorsese deserves praise for not going down the revisionist myth making route trodden by the Anthology series, especially as Olivia Harrison was one of his producers. Olivia is honest, though vague, about George's infidelity as is Klaus Voorman is about his drug problems. But the lack of a narrator almost makes George a mirror in which we see his world. We know he was loved, deeply, by friends - racing drivers, comedians and film makers, musicians, but we don't whether he was truly loveable. Terry Gilliam describes George as a mix of \\"grace, humour and a weird kind of angry bitterness\\" but what made him that way? Did he ever find a release from that bitterness? Was he a good father? Nearing death Harrison asked Olivia if he had been a good husband. She never tells us what her answer was.\\"What's the secret of a long marriage?\\" She asks herself. \\"Don't get divorced\\".<br /><br />It may sound strange but the highest point for me was simply hearing the music. Listening to Here Comes The Sun and While My Guitar Gently Weeps I was almost moved to tears at the transcendent beauty of those recordings.<br /><br />Perhaps the fact that the film cause me to fall in love with the music allover again is it's greatest recommendation.over again is it's greatest recommendation.
1423140591|4.0|I had no problems getting my book on kindle. I got it at 6 a.m. in the morning and I live in England!! This book is great. It had a lot of twists that made me go hum-didn't see that one coming. I got the uk version that same day to. No I am just waiting for the us version to come in. Can't wait for The Mark of Athena Book Three to come out next year. Happy reading!!
0553801473|3.0|Let me first say I have enjoyed all of the Song of Ice and Fire series, including this novel.  I rated it three stars because there was just SO much left unresolved in this book.  It's been ages since I read the previous novel so I spent a lot of time trying to recall what happened, and I felt that shortly after I got a good hold on it and re-identified with each character's story, the book ended.  I expected a lot of issues to remain unresolved, things that have been carried throughout the books, but I felt like a lot of new issues were introduced very briefly and then completely dropped.  I think that trying to hang onto all the threads was difficult while I was reading the book and will be really difficult by the time the next one comes out.  The whole novel just seemed a little more disjointed and less tidy than the rest of his works in this series, but I did remain very interested throughout and am looking forward to the next.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Shame on amazon.  This app no longer shows the daily free mp3 on the main screen, nor can you search for it through the app!!!!  :-(
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Agree with most reviews the graphics are not the sharpest and the game does not utilize the entire screen on my Photon.<br /><br />But the game play is good.
B005POK858|5.0|resembling final fantasy.  touch controls are smooth and itd easy to get use to. great buy. only thing hard to learn is the walking but that's nothing big its easy
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I am absolutely thrilled with this app.  I don't buy many but this one is more than worth the price if you are a person who needs a little white noise to go to sleep.  I am accustomed to sleeping with a fan on and when I travel it is extremely difficult to go to sleep in total silence.  There are a variety of noises to choose from and it also allows you to layer noises by being able to play up to 3 at the same time.  Whether it is a crackling campfire or the waves crashing on the beach or a simple air conditioner....Sleepytime does the job!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|I loved this movie! Yes, I admit some of it was pretty predictable, like the characters they bring in just to kill off. (Can we say second husband who woefully tells the ex-husband how much he's always wanted a family of his own and what a lucky man John Cusack's character is. Pretty obvious what's going to happen to this guy!) And the extremely sappy speech given at the end. Let me think. If there were only 14 minutes left until everyone died, I don't think anyone would be listening to one man's teary plea. And lastly the tear filled scene of everyone staring at the portal, hoping against hope for the main character to appear but fearing the worst. Good grief. Other than those goofy scenes, I have to say this was one of the best adventure movies I have ever seen! The special effects were AMAZING! I also thought the acting was great and really enjoyed John Cusack's character. Everyone has different opinions, and a lot of people didn't like this movie as obvious by all the one stars, but for this girl, it's a five star!
B004EPZ070|3.0|I generally like chick-lit romantic comedies, and am forgiving of the genre, but although this had good moments, overall I just can't give it more than 3 stars. The story came off as too disjointed, and some of the characterizations just didn't work. It's partly the fault of the complicated material - it centers on two best girl friends, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson. Hudson's character is a diva, and about to marry a good friend of Goodwin's (Colin Egglesifled) - who Goodwin still has feelings for, and eventually ends up in an affair with. The story centers around the affair, and Hudson's and Goodwin's friendship.<br /><br />While the film takes a decent stab at exploring infidelity and the complications of true-life romance, the characters end up too unlikable. I just ended up frustrated with everyone - Hudson's character seems too self-centered for anyone to like, Goodwin's too passive, and Egglesfield too dull to be inspiring all this passion and indecision. The film isn't overly tortured about the immorality of all the cheating and lying going on either. And then to top it off, John Krasinski (The Office), whom I'm a big fan of, is misused and underused, as a friend of Goodwin's.<br /><br />So overall, had some interesting moments, enough for 3 stars, but just didn't work at a level beyond that.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I've used both the SD Card Reader and the Camera Connecter  with my Powershot G11) both worked quickly, and flawlessly with my iPad 2. They weigh nothing and packed easily into my tiny camera case (which theoretically only has room for an extra memory card).  Best part: mind-numbingly simple to use.
0553801473|3.0|I remain appreciative of Martin's skill, but I've become exhausted with this series. I kept going with A Dance with Dragons - even though I found myself skipping large descriptive portions that I found indulgent and pointless - because I really hoped there was finally going to be some significant plot progress by the end. But there's not. 1000 pages and Daenerys is still not even bound for Westeros? New potential kings are still cropping up? We still don't know what's become of several Starks, the family we started this whole series with (and whom have been steadily tortured and destroyed in every way possible, with nary a sign of relief in sight?) It is just feeling so indulgent on Martin's part at this point. I am losing faith that there will be a payoff. I can't imagine what ending could possibly feel satisfying. There's a chance he could still pull it off, but I think he's just built anticipation too much, and tortured us as readers too much.<br /><br />And yes, he is still good at what he was always good at - creating a fully fleshed-out world that at this point we know like it's our own, and portraying the points of view of a dizzying array of characters. I don't think anything like it has ever been attempted, and I appreciate that. But enough already! Give us some beef...
B000P5FH3K|5.0|I think Matt Damon was better than Burt Lancaster[Believe it was him} in the original version. It arrived right on time and in good shape. Loved the movie more this time than when I saw it years ago. Great movie and a great buy.
B005DKLPF6|5.0|Nickelback had better step it up.  They've got some serious competition now.  Some of my friends would disagree, but I think \\"The Hunter\\" is even better than the Foo Fighters' latest, \\"Wasting Light\\".  When it comes to modern rock, it just doesn't get any better than this.
0553807048|3.0|The first book \\"The Wolf on Wall Street\\" left me wanting more, a conclusion. This book gives you just that. As with the first book the story is a bit of a reach but its fun to just go with it and enjoy the book for what it is: A rise and fall self destructive tragety. Lessons learned!<br />Buyer beware - Strong language and content. Its not as good as the first book a bit repetitive - But its Okay.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|product came in the mail, as stated. the movie was good as it was on the dvd and theater. i view the movie great, the service is of purchasing is good.
0553583182|5.0|I first read this book when I was 26 year old some 31 years ago. I've read it several times over the years and have given the book as a gift more times then I can remember. I can honestly say when I first read this book I was a young man with a family, broke, hopeless and going nowhere fast - It changed my life.<br />Within a year of reading \\"The Power...\\" I started my own business and to cut to the chase I retired at 52 a self made man, happily married 38 years, healthy, wealthy and wise. And I owe much of it to this book and others like it.<br />If you'd like to change your path in life you need to change and understand your MIND.<br />Buy it, read it, learn it and live it. Great book.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie... really makes you think about the government controls thats for sure! I think everyone ought to see this movie.
0553384775|4.0|I liked this book, its an intresting story but it's not for everybody. Mr Belfort is not the most polished author so following the plot can a challange at times, and he's a bit crude in his descriptions and the foul language, Ouch!<br />For a true story, I found some information a little far reaching but it makes for good theater. Overall, I enjoyed the story of his rise on Wall Street and self destructibive fall, but he goes from dead broke to a millionaire in the first 10 pages of the book - I would have liked a little more history on the rise.<br />Being originally from the East Coast (Brooklyn) I can deal with the content and understand the hard hitting language but it may offend some. If your sensitive you may want to pass, otherwise it can be a fun and insightful read.
B00005JPSM|4.0|There are few movies to watch in the kitchen while cooking the evening meal. This one is good and also is Love's Kitchen.
1589795474|4.0|I always wanted to know how and why so many people look, act and live like millionaires, now I know. Coming home from a business trip I found this book in the airport and read it on the plane. I liked this book because it opens your eyes to the fact that there are really very few true millionaires and many pretenders.<br />Can you say DEBT...I don't want to give away the whole book because its interesting but that just about sum's it up for me. I enjoyed it, some good factual information.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|Magna films is known for a great line of low budget; under the radar films. Troll Hunter is one of these unnoticed movies that has it all. Excitement, imagery, and a very intresting story line, this movie is a must have.
B0050I2P32|5.0|After doing an album of garage/punk and another of shoegaze/Goth, the Horrors release their 3rd<br />  album.  This time it's packed with epic, sweeping, lush songs with a grandiose, reach-for-the-sky<br />  feel.  Soaring, shoegazey, flower-power guitars are woven through 80s style ambient/rhythmic<br />  synthesizer waves, and led by bigger-than-life \\"new romantic\\" rock star vocals.  Overblown,<br />  majestic and dangerously near pretentious, \\"Skying\\" defies the odds and comes across as a<br />  powerfully sincere & beautifully elevating musical journey.  Pass the dark purple lipstick;<br />  show me the golden stairs.  Recalls the Teardrop Explodes, Psychedelic Furs, Modern English,<br />  Simple Minds, Echo & the Bunnymen, My Bloody Valentine, Spandau Ballet, Spiritualized.  Band<br />  is based in London.
0634049011|5.0|I've been \\"playing\\" guitar as a hobby for close to 25 years, but it's always just been memorizing tabs for songs I like, never really understanding what I was playing.  About a year ago I decided I wanted to actually learn some music theory.  Bought a few books, which helped, but this book was the lightbulb moment.  Something about the teaching pattern here just works for me: learn the concept, say it aloud, diagram it on paper, then play the diagram.  It's a process that covers aural learners, visual learners (diagramming was the biggie for me) and hands-on learners.  Dude just flat-out knows how to teach.
B005EHNEDO|4.0|It's the 9th album since 1995 from these Chicago icons of the alt-Americana music world.  Ground<br />  breaking?  No.  Earth shattering? No.  It's Wilco music.  They pretty much have their own<br />  category now.  It's comfortable, but not too comfortable.  It's innovative, but not too innovative.<br />  Immersed in strangeness, but immediately recognizable.  Compelling, with a gentle and genuine<br />  rootsy authenticity.  Jeff Tweedy's voice is the call of a dependable, long-time friend; you know he<br />  won't disappoint.  This is the kind of loose, but highly professional, Americana rock that you can<br />  take home to Mom; and she'll love it--given that she understands the unpredictable evolutionary<br />  twinges of artistic integrity.  Simple, beautiful, earthy--but never pointless, contrived, or even<br />  predictable.  Something you could happily crawl under the covers with and never get bored.
0061992860|4.0|Going on reputation alone, the book is worth the price.  Certainly the \\"don't do this at home\\" warning on the inside cover makes it fun, too.  Here are my pros and cons:  Pros:  1. Written by arguably the highest authority in the subject.  2. Tons of immediately practicable ideas.  3. Tons of info that, if committed to memory, could be immensely useful (like what animals and animal behavior to look for when looking for water).  4. This version (Collins Gem) is small enough that you can bring it with you when you are out backpacking (some of your more granola-ey trailmates might make fun of your \\"survivalist\\" geekosity) or hunting, and some of its contents can actually be attempted without practice.  Of course, you may or may not be right about which ones.  5. It has advice for surviving disasters, not just surviving in the wild alone.  Cons:  1. This con should probably be obvious about any book of this type: A book alone will usually not substitute for hands-on, repeated practice of most of its contents.  2. The amount of information seems to be the product of years of study and practice on the part of the author (and contributors to his education and experience).  This means the sheer volume of info is overwhelming.  3. The organization is a bit (only a bit) mysterious in parts, and the author can tend to jump around.    4. Particulars of some advice is potentially slightly archaic, though the underlying philosophy is totally sound.  For example, \\"choosing a knife\\" lists important attributes like a handle that is \\"single rounded piece of wood, the knife tang passing through it and fastened at the end.\\"  Looking through Amazon's selection of knives, for example, one would see that most contemporary fixed-blade knives no longer have wood handles.  Another example, in hygiene in low-water situations, he suggests that using some water to wash after defecation is important, but doesn't mention the possible use of hand sanitizers (which may or may not work, but should be addressed).  Overall, it is enjoyable casual reading, and I look forward to practicing some of its contents (in a safe and controlled environment, mind you).  I have not taken any of the various civilian survival classes, nor did I receive any of this type of training when I was in the Marine Corps.  I have backpacked and look forward to showing off some of the less risky knowledge to impress my trailmates.  Most backpackers, in my experience, won't think that this book is anything more than entertaining because they will almost always be on well-traveled and/or well-marked trails (falls and insect bites are apparently the greatest dangers to this group). Perhaps the parts regarding dangerous animals and plants to avoid would be useful.  If you spend your back country time in actually remote areas (and outside of the US), this book (and a class or two) could be very useful and perhaps even necessary.  It even has potential use for the person who never leaves an urban home, provided a disaster affects them, and provided they have studied the relevant parts, practiced them if necessary, and have the book in their emergency kit.
B005BJ7Y54|5.0|2nd album from San Francisco band pulls from the pop roots of 50s/60s rock `n' roll with a<br />  perceptive, appreciative reverence; and molds the influence into something altogether fresh,<br />  exciting, modern and comfortably addictive.  Girls have a brilliant sense of how to lay out a<br />  melody so that it calls you in like a long-tressed siren wearing only a glittery electric guitar and a<br />  blissed-out, come-hither rock-stoned smile.  Christopher Owens' voice is a subtle, unobtrusive,<br />  perfectly-pitched beacon of accessible emotional angst--delivered with a rock-star professional<br />  sincerity that sends shivers of self-identification dancing up your spine.  These are epic,<br />  sweeping, beautiful & compelling rock songs played by a band who are so \\"in the moment\\" that<br />  almost every tune feels stronger that the last.  Nowhere is there a wasted note or harmony.<br />  Each part slides succinctly and naturally into an impressive, complete moment in time.  Recalls<br />  the Beatles, the Goldberg Sisters, the Drums, Dr. Dog, Beach Boys, Surfer Blood, Eno, Phil<br />  Spector, Stratford 4, Jesus & Mary Chain.  An absolutely stunning, immediate contender for<br />  album of the year!
B00005U122|5.0|I am not going to rave on and on about this dvd as a lot of other people have written very good reviews on it already.I will say if you are a fan of Pink Floyd,Roger Waters or just a fan of good music you need to add this to your collection.My wife got this for me as a Christmas gift after we saw Roger perform The Wall show in Atlanta back in November 2010 and I have watched this several times and have enjoyed it thoroughly.Roger is at top form every time he goes on stage and this dvd is no exception so take my advise and buy it,it's worth every penny.
0321647440|3.0|I am one of those people who gets more from reading a book and figuring things out for myself vs. the \\"tutorial\\" form that this book takes. I guess it is about personal preference, but I needed a reference book for those moments when I found myself asking \\"how do I . . . \\"  This book spends an awful lot of time on file management, naming, rating, marking, blah blah, which may be of great utility to a professional, but I doubt that many professionals use Aperture anyway. The book is well illustrated and the DVD is good, except for the oft noted software glitch.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|I love Natalie Portman, but I thought she's given better performances than this. I had a lot of questions as to her depressed character. I supposed her mother, played by Barbara Hershey, whom I also enjoy as an actress, could be said to have had the most negative influence on the Portman characters neurosis for being to pushy. But  overall, the movie was just too disjointed for me. I also think that the \\"real\\" ballerina, Sarah Cohen should have been given attention by the producer/director of this film after Natalie claimed the Oscar.   So for me, this film was depressing and not entertaining. I'm glad I didn't waste money going to the theater.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a great game, it works smoothly, doesn't freeze up on my phone and is fun to play. You work through many levels fighting different zombies in different settings. Once you work through the game you can play individual quick round games as well as some variants like zombie bowling.
B00475BUVM|3.0|I really enjoyed this film a lot, being a huge fan of the original 1981 classic.  I don't see it as a re-make at all, and it doesn't interfere in any way with the original film.  It's a great stand-alone movie in its own right, and I give it 5 stars for that.  However, the 3D effects were just terrible.  I didn't see any popping-out effects at all.  There was depth, sure, but it's not all I wanted.  These producers or 3D specialists really need to add more outward depth to these films!  From now on, I'm going to consult with Amazon reviews for any future 3D purchases I make.  When I want 3D, I WANT 3D!!!
B0058WFO06|5.0|If looking for a quick and summarizing review - you owe it to yourself, whether you are familiar with Steven Wilson or a complete newcomer, to buy this album and experience it for yourself. It is timeless.  Coming from a fan of a wide range of music, ranging from jazz, to classic and progressive rock, to extreme metal, etc...This an album for anyone who loves music and the complete merging of passion and emotion with sound. There are some of the most soothing, beautiful, well written melodies I've ever heard throughout the album. Yes, I do mean ever. From the opening title track, to Deform to Form a Star, Postcard, and the absolutely beautiful closing track Like Dust I have Cleared from my Eye...it is song writing at a level that few reach in their career. Timeless perfect melodies without the need for complexity or arrogance. Just...pure.  The album itself must, without doubt, be viewed as the piece that it is. The beauty of the album is how the aforementioned melody and beauty is intertwined seamlessly with dark, jazzy, unconventional at times songs as well. The song track 1 itself is representative of that contrast blending a smooth and beautiful acoustic/vocal with a heavy, brooding, dark sound. There are moments on the album I only can think to describe as dark jazz....I've really heard nothing like it. The album is absolutely heavy at times...but not in the traditional loud guitar way. It's a heavy, brooding bass that drives home the heaviness in a much more cerebral way. Sectarian and Raider II (which itself could have a review written of it - a complete epic journey of a song representing SW's mastery of his influences) are good examples...Every song, without sparing a second, is top notch and a perfect small piece of the whole that is Grace for Drowning.  Timeless song writing, perfect production (the concepts/art work of Lasse Hoile are as wonderful as ever), and an album with just an absolutely gorgeous blend of emotions on every level. I really could notask for more in a record. That is what makes those albums throughout time that hang around and always have something to offer you, no matter how many spins, or how many years its been since the first experience. A true five star album.
B00536OCZA|3.0|This is my fourth vinyl copy of this epic recording. Although the remastering is fine, though I'm not sure it's any better than the MFSl vinyl, the condition of the record is appalling. It is loaded with what look like paper scuffs, it has some shiny grit on it that look metallic, it looks like the release agent was roughly wiped from the surface. I was frankly afraid to play it with my favorite cartridge, Grado Red.   I gave it a light dusting with a carbon fiber brush and a good cleaning with my trusty DiscWasher pad and fluid, being careful to eliminatet the grit and grime from the mat on the turntable.  Then came time to listen. The dead groove at the beginning had a \\"swish swish swish\\" noise leading into the thumping of the first track. Clicks and pops occured at irregular intervals all through side 1. The first track on side 2, \\"Money\\", was awsome, then the quiet levels of \\"Us and Them\\" failed to cover up the background noise. The playing condition of this brand new Lp on 180 gram vinyl was at best a VG+. As I listened to the rest of the album I began typing up the RMA request from Amazon.  I only hope that the replacement LP is in better condition than this one that was obviously rushed to packaging.  Well, my second copy was just like the first. I returned it for a refund and also cancelled my pre-order for \\"Wish You Were Here\\" vinyl.   If I didn't know better I'd say it's a conspiracy to kill the booming vinyl trend.....
0671578855|5.0|I'd strongly endorse all the positive comments in the many reviews here -- *A Civil Campaign* is not just a good book but an excellent, funny, and very intelligent one, a great novelist at the top of her form and a lasting joy. It's also even cleverer and subtler in its generic engineering of SF and Regency romance than even those who love it sometimes appreciate, and to celebrate the Silver Centenary of the Vorkosiverse (1986-2011), the members of the official LMB mailing-list compiled and edited a *Reader's Companion to a Civil Campaign*, which has some introductory mini-essays on the novel's dedicatees (Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Heyer, and Sayers), and on Shakespeare, as intertexts, and on the subtitle (\\"A comedy of biology and manners\\"), as well as chapter-by-chapter annotations. There are also numerous quotations from posts LMB has made to the list and at Baen's Bar, about her art and craft of writing, and about details of characters and events, which will enrich anyone's reading not only of *A Civil Campaign* but of all her work.    The *Reader's Companion to A Civil Campaign* is available as a free download from the Bujold Nexus, at <[...]>.
B002VPE1XE|4.0|I needed a case for a Canon SX130 IS camera. It was difficult to find one that I was confident would be large enough for this camera. This case is a pretty good match for the camera. The case closes with a hook-and-loop (velcro) flap. The flap seems adequate for holding the camera in the case, though it doesn't perfectly cover the opening in the case. I actually like the flap; it is very easy and quick to open the case to remove the camera. There is also a small compartment large enough for a couple extra batteries. The zipper on the compartment seems to close it securely; I don't think the zipper would open on it's own, though I don't know that from personal experience. I'm sure there are many better cases out there, but not anywhere near this price. Bottom line for me is that it protects the screen on the back of the Canon SX130 IS camera, which is the main thing I was interested in.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|These are 2 of my all time favorite games, and I remember thinking how great it would be if they were remade in HD long before this collection was announced. And the remake is a high quality one, not a quick and easy cash in. Things like textures look great, and ICO in widescreen makes a huge difference. These games share an ethereal quality and atmosphere unlike any other game out there, and are rightly considered by many to be works of art. Both games are now locked at 30fps which is a massive improvement, especially in Shadow of the Colossus. I probably would have paid over $100 for this collection, so at $40 it's a definite buy.
B0052TDGQO|3.0|I was actually surprised how much I liked Scotty's debut... well, not the entire album, but he does deliver about 3-4 strong tracks (which is much better than I expected).  The bottom line: this is no \\"SOME HEARTS\\" for sure (Carrie is the best in the business, bar none) but Scotty should be happy he silenced the naysayers and gave his fans a solid album.  In fact, when you think of the mediorce, gimmicky cds that Blake Shelton released over the last 10 years (until he finally gave us 2 good songs: Honey Bee, God Gave...) Scotty's first effort is pleasantly better than expected.  Give him a few years....
0316010669|4.0|This Gladwell book focuses on the age-old question of whether to make a snap judgment decision using your gut or spend the time to gather all the information, develop alternatives, and select the best option.  Humans probably have a quick built-in decision making system because we had to make up our minds quickly to run from the lion or stay and fight in the early generations of our existence.  The advantage of making snap judgments is how quickly and easily they can be made. No time, effort, or thinking is required to make snap judgments.  The author argues we should utilize snap judgments more often because they are fairly accurate and easy to make.  He argues that 6 minute speed dating meetings are much more efficient and accurate than elaborate courting rituals.  Other examples include predicting the probability of divorce by observing a couple for only a few minutes.  Gladwell contradicts himself with his example of emergency room doctors. One might think experienced ER doctors should be accurate at diagnosing heart attacks. It turns out they are not accurate.  A doctor spent years studying these types of cases and developed a flow chart which diagnosed heart attacks quickly based upon only a few factors. Flow charts are commonly using in industrial engineering to simplify and standardize processes.  I found nothing too revolutionary about the idea of developing a flow chart to diagnose heart attacks.  I had not heard of the 2 gentlemen who documented all possible facial expressions. This must have been the idea that led to the TV show Lie to Me.  Gladwell argues that juries should not get to see any of the people involved in a trial. He claims seeing the people involved would bias the opinion of the jury. After having been in two trials that each lasted five weeks, I disagree with this recommendation. The subject of the trial was highly technical and I doubt the jury was able to grasp the technical part of the trial.  They were able to easily able to figure out who was lying in their testimony and who was not. I'm sure that body language of the participants played a key factor in these trials.  Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian economist. Around 1900, he observed that 80% of the wealth or income in Italy was attributed to only 20% of the population.  He found the same phenomena in England, and it applies to the U.S. today.  Pareto's 80:20 rule allows people to spend their critical time and resources on the key 20% that cause 80% of the issue being studied.  Gladwell seems to argue in his book that we should try to increase our usage of our snap decision making abilities as a more efficient way to solve problems. An example would be observing a couple talk about their dog for 60 minutes as a way to predict their probability of divorce.......versus hours and hours of therapy.  I also had not heard the example of the Chancellorville Civil War battle. General Hooker had more than twice the number of soldiers (134,000 versus 61,000), twice the artillery pieces, and hot air balloons for intelligence gathering compared to Robert E. Lee. Hooker successfully split his army into two and maneuvered half of his army around Lee without being detected.  All Hooker had to do was commence and follow-through on the attack to defeat Lee.  In sports terms, Hooker choked once the battle started and retreated.  Lee won the battle.  Gladwell argues that Lee won because he had less information than Hooker.  He thinks Hooker had too much information and over-analyzed the situation.  The most important question in Gladwell's book is not the effectiveness of gut decisions in some situations versus drawn-out analysis.  The real question is...What are the guidelines for when to make snap decisions versus detailed problem-solving steps?  Gladwell does suggest that gut instincts work best in complex decision making like choice of your mate or your profession.  I would argue that if time permits, I would recommend doing both (gut decision and detailed analysis) and comparing the final recommendations.  In the business world, one never has all the needed information. Decisions must still be made and part of the art of management is knowing how to make decisions with limited information. Sensitivity analysis can be used to help understand the impact of changes in key variables.  I would like to see new techniques developed for airport screening.  I would think a combination of Israeli type questioning of passengers plus facial feature recognition might end the thoughtless screening of children and grandparents.  All-in-all a good read. This book was not as well designed or as interesting a read as Tipping Point.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Something Borrowed was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  This is also one of the few movies that stayed true to the book.  I laughed & cried all the way through this movie.  My husband also enjoyed  this movie as much I did!!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|These transfers are absolutely fantastic, definitely worth every penny, forget about those bad reviews, they don't know anything, who knows if they've even seen these versions of the films, just because they \\"heard\\" of these new changes, they automatically assume they're worse, and the films are ruined, THEY ARE NOT!!!  They are absolutely beautiful, the original moves hold up really well to the blue-ray transfer, that's what I was really hoping for, if  the blue-ray format would bring out more clearity to the original films, and it did, 100%.  The delivery service for these films was also fantastic, I ordered it on the 1st, and recieved it 3 days later, and I had Free Super Savers discount too, two thumbs way up, definitely recommend, ignore the bad reviews, and buy this.

B004ZNA5JO|5.0|Pink Floyd's triumphant comeback (their 13th studio album) entitled A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September of 1987.<br />The album was the first without original member bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters whom acrimoniously split from his bandmates in 1985.<br />For years, many thought that 1983's aptly named The Final Cut was the farewell album of Pink Floyd's but singer/songwriter/guitarist David Gilmour, drummer Nick Mason (although he plays on half of the disc because his playing was underestimated by Waters and wasn't until the Momentary Lapse tour where he played better again) and the late great keyboard player Rick Wright (as a salaried musician nonetheless) along with co-producer Bob Ezrin and session bass player Tony Levin spent eight months recording the album at David's houseboat studio the Astoria in London and at various studios in London and L.A. (where they relocated after Roger's lawyers threatened legal action) with many people doubting the Floyd being relevant without Waters.<br />However, when I (as an 11 year old boy in 1987) first heard the first single \\"Learning to Fly\\", I was in reassured that Floyd was back in a big way. When my father brought home the album for me shortly after its release, I was amazed on how superb this album was.<br />It was in fact David Gilmour whom sang most of the classics from 1969 to 1975 before Waters went on his ego trip for the next three discs (no disrespect to those last three albums (the underrated Animals, the epic The Wall and the somewhat bleak The Final Cut), I like all of Floyd's work and am an unbiased die-hard fan). The songwriting burden nestled now on David's shoulders (he wrote all of the music and gave credit to those who came up with small ideas but he isn't confident in writing lyrics hence other people help with the lyrics).<br />The instrumental opening \\"Signs of Life\\" dated back to a riff that first emerged in the Animals era and a great instrumental. The aforementioned \\"Learning to Fly\\" follows and was a great song. The ominous \\"The Dogs of War\\" is next and featured one of David's best guitar solos and Carmine Appice was on drums on this track. We then segue into \\"One Slip\\" which is another great song and was co-written by Gilmour with Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera and is where the album got its title. The poverty and injustice anthem \\"On the Turning Away\\" is one of Floyd's best songs and was another rock radio smash upon release.<br />\\"Yet Another Movie\\" and \\"Round and Around\\" kicked off the album's second half and reminded me musically of Wish You Were Here era Floyd and is killer. The \\"A New Machine (pt.1)\\"/\\"Terminal Frost\\"/\\"A New Machine (pt.2)\\" medley though they are separate tracks are spellbinding. The best track on the album was the closing \\"Sorrow\\" which goes back to the old epics of the past clocking in at close to 9 minutes.<br />The Momentary Lapse album was well received when release as it hit #3 on the album charts here in the US and #1 on the CD charts here in the US. Also, the album sold over 5 million in the US alone to date and proved that the Floyd could survive without Waters. Also, the band embarked on a tour that would go on for three years and be documented on the album/video Delicate Sound of Thunder.<br />Now in 2011, as part of the Why Pink Floyd? campaign, this album is re-mastered and re-released. This is an improvement on the remaster that James Guthrie and Joel Plante had done in 2005 which was slightly compressed but this is better and is not as loud as that one done for Sony due to Sony (who no longer hold the licensing rights to Pink Floyd's catalog) losing their copies of the masters. An Experience version is due in the future and is going to feature a re-recording of the album's drums and keyboard tracks (Rick's keyboards will be taken from performances while Nick has reportedly re-recorded his drum tracks to make the album sound not as 1980s).<br />Highly recommended!ollows and was a great song.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Totally worth a dollar, at the least. I wondered if it was possible for an app to get almost all five star reviews, but this earns it.
B004UXUSIM|4.0|In addition to the sordid life that adds fuel to the fire of Hollywood celebrity news, Woody Allen's been making some degenerate stuff (e.g., Vicky Cristina Barcelona) aimed at the core of civilization, rather like The Exterminating Angel, which Allen references in this movie. So I haven't paid attention to him for a while. From recent photos from the opening of this movie Midnight in Paris, it appears he's suffering from that human condition that makes him now indistinguishable from the elderly Alec Guinness.<br /><br />The argument Allen gives us in Midnight in Paris is that the sensation of infinity experienced in love is the only antidote to the fear of death.  And the purpose of art is to help people deal with the neuroses that attend the fear.  Of course, the other antidote is immortality through fame, and this is the route Allen has chosen for himself, as he tells us in this film.  Here is the typical Woody Allen focus on sexual betrayal, death, and the meaninglessness of life, but with just the right touch of nostalgia so that the film actually critiques modern times rather than fanning the flames.<br /><br />As you probably know, the Woody-Allen-stand-in played by Owen Wilson is an aspiring writer who vacations in Paris and is picked up by a taxi-cab from the 1920s every midnight. Awe and hilarity ensue, and Wilson realizes he can't love his fiancee, who is a Malibu bimbo.  Humor-wise, the best part of the film (spoiler alert) is when Wilson gets into a cab with Eliot and tells him \\"Prufrock's been like the theme of my life...\\"<br /><br />Slightly less obviously, the film is Allen's nose-snubbing at the rest of the world. Wilson is a self-effacing writer who, nevertheless, won't let anyone critique his novel until he meets Hemingway and Gertrude Stein. The implicit message here is that, unlike the Tea Partiers and hoi polloi of the U.S., Allen is a Real Artist, whose work is fit to be judged only by his peers in the artists' pantheon.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris is filled with references to giants of modern literature and art. Allen throws us some bones, but if you don't get the joke about Prufrock above due to not knowing either Woody Allen films or T.S. Eliot, you aren't going to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I saw this movie in the theater, so I have to go by memory here, but I believe the \\"portrait of Adriana\\" by \\"Picasso\\" looks very close to Picasso's painting The Bather but is not.  Is it missing the beach ball and the horizon?  If you get this on DVD or Blu-Ray, keep your eye out for this detail...ants of modern literature and art.

1423140591|5.0|If you weren't a fan of the last book don't worry, you will love this one.  Percy is back in full steam with all his witty awesomeness.<br /><br />The book starts off in Percy's POV and switches between Frank and Hazel.  Two Roman demigods who have a captivating story of their own. The book follows them as their fates intertwine and are ultimately led on a quest to once again save civilization.<br /><br />I think Rick did the best he ever did as far as developing the characters, I truly felt their pain.  And nothing ever felt forced.<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of the first book and this book was going to determine if I stuck with it and I'm glad I gave this series another chance.  It was truly like a sequel to the original Percy Jackson books.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I must say I really do wish that Mr. Lucas could keep his grubby hands off of HIS movies from now on. These look amazing on blu-ray tho. It makes it all worth it. I would rather watch this version then the old versions. I know, I know i'm crazy right? Well I really feel that I could put up with Han shooting second for 99.5% of the original movies in blu-ray quality. Oh also if your (Mr. Lucas) going to change things like the whole Han, Guido scene then at least make it look legit. It looks like a high school kid spent and hour using premier pro on it and it was his first project ever. Also when Han walks over Jabba's tale, c'mon that looks horrible! You would think with all of the money that these movies have made over the years that we could get some CGI that doesn't suck! I also liked that originally Jabba wasn't in the first movie, only spoke of. It made him more of a mystery. Then when you first saw him you were shocked. And the \\"Nooooo!\\" at the end ended up making a deep scene into a very corny scene. But my rant is over. I still say get them. The special feature discs are beyond amazing!
0765350386|5.0|This is the first novel by Brandon Sanderson that I've read.  I'm sorry to say that I've had the book since 2007, and it's taken me four years to read it.  My initiative was caused by a recent podcast I listened to in which I heard about the roleplaying game that is being published based on the Mistborn series.  I've been interested in good worldbuilding in my fantasy reads lately, and so all the good words spoken about the series caused me to go back and finally read this thing.  What an amazing read!  Once the book got going a hundred or so pages in I really had a hard time putting it down.  Questions in the plot created huge tension for me, wondering what was to happen to Kelsier, Vin, and the Skaa rebellion.  And who/what is the Lord Ruler?  I had to read through this one as fast as I could to find out.  The mark of a wonderful, thrilling read.  I could go on and on about this one, but suffice it to say that anyone who likes the fantasy genre should go pick this one up.  The action was thrilling, fun, and easy to follow.  The \\"magic\\" system in this book, allomancy and feruchemy, were cool and original, creating interesting action.  I loved the underdog status of the Skaa and their rebellion, and a villain you love to hate in the Lord Ruler who is deserved of his comeuppance.  I've read a lot of fantasy in my day, and the world here - a fallen, dark, grey world, with a blood red sun and ash falling from the sky - reminded me a lot of the Dark Sun campaign setting.  The evil Lord Ruler - God/Emperor - reminded me a bit of King Kalak of Tyr.  I love that setting, and I love this setting as well.  I can't wait to read more, and I am looking forward to moving on to the second book.  This time it won't take me four years to get to reading it!  In addition, Sanderson is a great author, and I am looking forward to reading his other works as well!  Great job!
0307346617|4.0|The zombie apocalypse has fascinated and captured the imaginations of all different kinds of people.  It seems like only 10 years ago, we were attached to the idea of a meteor hitting the Earth (Armageddon, Deep Impact).  It kind of makes me wonder what the next doomsday scenario is going to be?  However, as far as 2012 possibilities are concerned, the zombie apocalypse sets itself apart from a meteor hitting the Earth in many ways (aside from the obvious 'one involves a meteor').  For one, the comet hitting Earth, seems to have one catastrophic outcome - which is total annihilation, and one way to fight it off - destroy it before it makes impact, most likely with a nuclear warhead.  The outbreak of a worldwide zombie pandemic however, can have so many more scenarios:  How does it spread? Do we find a cure? Are we wiped out?  How do we fight it off? What are the casualties? What does it mean for the future? Max Brooks takes all these questions into account, and much more in this 'Oral History of the Zombie War.'    For anyone a fan of previous zombie stories, the first thing you might notice is it doesn't cover the lives of a small group of people, and their story of survival through it.  Instead, the worst has already happened, and the book follows Brooks, as a member of the United Nations Postwar Commission.  He interviews with everyone from people with their families, to military and government officials from all around the world, to doctors searching for a cure, and even an astronaut that watched the outbreak from space!  From these stories, we gain a much deeper understanding of the consequences, what did and didn't work against it, the terror people felt, and the extremes that some people would go to save themselves, as well as the people around them.   What really kept me reading, was that it was scary!  This goes back to how he tells the story from many different points of views.  The reader gets put in the shoes, and feels the terror, of all different kindsof people, with different circumstances.  The zombies themselves, have been given several interesting scenarios too - zombies underwater;  zombies that have been frozen, thawed out, and still attacking; and limbs that move without a body.    It may have gotten a little bit ridiculous with the whole astronaut in outer space (would they really be worrying about a rescue mission into space for one guy, when people are dropping left and right down on Earth?), but so what?  It was worth a little bit of ridiculousness, because it added a dimension to the story that we wouldn't have gotten otherwise. You might be thinking there can't be much character development.  In this story, it doesn't matter because it's not what drives it.  What drives it, is the zombies and how people were reacting to it in that very instant.  You could almost say, that this broad scope of interviews and stories gives us development of the human psyche as a whole.  All in all, for anyone with an interest in the subject, this book is highly reccomended.

030746363X|5.0|I bought this book after seeing the first 15 minutes of an interview with Tim Ferriss. After having had the book for about a month, I could rave about it for hours. But I won't. I'll just confirm what Mr. Ferriss is saying in his book - it's easy to stay motivated, when you see results right away! After two weeks of use, I see real changes of muscle in my arms, pecs and shoulders. That's after five minutes a day, three times a week - a total of 30 minutes easy exercise! Also, for the first time in my life, I'm not snacking on sweets (except om Saturdays) - not because I'm forcing myself to, I just don't feel like it.   OK, so I started raving anyway...

Diamond presents a rather unique perspective on cultures, comparing ancient civilizations to the new, and finds some striking similarities.  I don't know if I buy 100% of what he says, but it definitely makes me look at the world a little differently now.
B000BBOUD6|5.0|Legends of the Fall is one of my favorite.  It is the type of movie I can watch many times.  I like how it develops the characters.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This is the absolute minimum any USB connector could be, lacking even the usual metal shield.  You wouldn't believe it could connect to a standard USB, but it does if you insert it properly. I don't think this would hold up to a lot of handling, but it's fine if you keep it somewhat protected, like in a pocket of your camera or laptop case.  I've had it for about six weeks and had no problems with it using up to 32 GB micro SD cards.

6305754969|5.0|Husband loved it. He tried to find this old movie everywhere, when he told me I said I'll get it at Amazon. How many do you want. Quick delivery too.
B00004T0P1|5.0|When I first saw the movie as a kid, I instantly fell in love with JNH's magnificent score for the film.  Orchestral beauty and bombast from start to finish, definitely among JNH's best in his career.  Don't hesitate, just buy it!  If you're a fan of grand, epic film scores of any kind or a fan of any work from JNH, you will not regret it!
1600242405|4.0|Johnny Depp reads the first third or so of the audiobook, then Joe Hurley takes over and does a better job of relating the real experience of Keith Richards' life.  I'm wondering how this book even got written considering the life KR had.  Did he dictate this?  Did he sit down and write it all out?  Did he have a ghost writer?  Oh my Oh my.  The people, the drugs, the music, the experience of it all may be a life some aspire to...the Rock and Roll star lifestyle.  But after hearing this virtually endless account of Keith Richards' amazing life, I can't imagine why anyone would want it.  I'm just amazed Keith is still alive after all this!  He must be a genetic anomaly.  Quite a fascinating tale.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|The FiiO E5 is a good portable amp. The bass boost EQ mode really pumps up the bass, and increases the soundstage to another level. There is some distortion from pushing your headphones to the next limit, but overall keeping the sound at a normal volume makes it sound amazing. It works wonders for its price, and I cannot even begin to imagine how great the more expensive amps from FiiO work. It's slim, pocketable, and does the job very well. If you have a good pair of headphones, this adds a welcome and fresh new sound to them. I personally have tried them on the only headphones I currently own : the Dre Beats Solo HD. The ease of use of connecting, especially with the added connectors in the box are splendid. This is a product for beginners, and it works great for its purpose. It can also be used on the 360 so now I can use any headphone on the 360 for sound in my dorm room. Perfect.

B005G4TJUC|1.0|I really enjoyed the first two live-action Transformers movie but this one ... no! I was definitely disappointed with the casting of Sam's new love interest. There was a lot of action but it seemed \\"action for the sake of action.\\" I felt that the picture \\"worked too hard at being good.\\" There were times I couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon. Some of the scenes were extremely crude and others tried my patience. So no Megatron, no Ironhide, and no Sentinel Prime. We have the one-armed Optimus and the unscaved Bumblebee. Agent Simmons was there being well ... he was there. Better luck next time, Bay.
0670022950|4.0|Steven Pinker compiles a tremendous amount of evidence to prove that overall the news is good and Mankind is in the direction of lesser and lesser violence. Unfortunately as he should well know, by extrapolating present trends one does not gain a picture of the future. Surprise is a major element in human history, and it can lead to a reversal or total overthrow of what all the prior evidence has led us to believe will happen. Thus in regard to violence one can point today to signs of increasing nuclear proliferation, and a world in which nuclear war far more likely. One can speak about the interconnectedness of systems and the means there are of totally upsetting the world's communications. Martin Rees has said that the chance Mankind given the many possible sources of violent destruction, both natural and unnatural which are in process, has a fifty percent likelihood of surviving this century. So I believe Pinker's argument simply provides false assurance, and fake knowledge about a situation we cannot really be certain about.<br />A second fault I find in this book is its obscene relation to the mass- murders of the twentieth century. Does it help the victims of the Nazis, of Stalin, of Mao to know that there was once upon a time a Ghengis Khan? Pinker too ignores the unique quality of the twentieth century horrors, the wedding of a hate- driven Ideology to Technical Progress. He ignores when he speaks about 'decline in violence' the fact that there is now the possibility of massive and total destruction of Mankind in a way there never was before the invention of nuclear weapons.<br />He also puts far too much weight on the situation of the past sixty- five years the period which was dominated by the Superpower standoff, and in which there did not break out another major war. Without getting into it it is possible to say that the Soviets and the Americans more than once came close to nuclear disaster. Ron Rosenbaum's recent examination of the revival of the nuclear threat makes this perfectly clear.Moreover what he calls the 'Long Peace' is at sixty - five years not that long. And the alleged 'American Hegemony' which followed the collapse of the Soviet Union is today seriously under challenge not only by Radical Islam, but perhaps even more significantly by an expanding China. Moreover the mass- murders in Ruanda, in Laos, in Darfur, in Kosovo suggest there have been horrible incidents of violence in this allegedly peaceful time. So for some it certainly is hard to understand it as a period of 'decline in violence'. But once again the real question and criticism is the assumption of being able to know the Future from the seeming lull of violence in this brief period of time.<br />Again Pinker has provided much evidence in various areas of Decline in violence. We are not as bad as hunter- cavemen. The nation- state when it is not engaged in suppression and mass- murder does put limitations on certain kinds of violence. People are far more 'gentle' in various areas and do provide recognition of certain groups more persecuted previously. There is progress in the West certainly in regard to the rights of women, and minorities.The Enlightentment has effected a change in values. But it is important to note that in the great majority of the world's countries there is still the rule by oppressing minorities, there is still the suppression of human rights. The human situation is by no means one of 'simple progress' toward those values Pinker rightly champions i.e. Empathy for others , moral concern and action, Rationality.<br />In fact what is clear is that Pinker shows how irrational the most rational of human beings can be when they want to shore up their argument with tons of evidence while ignoring the basic and incontovertible objections to it.t makes this perfectly clear.Moreover what he calls the 'Long Peace' is at sixty - five years not that long.

B00065EB2M|4.0|What we always wanted to see, but never got to see while it happen,<br />(because they always seemed to show this in the middle of the night<br />and we could look at some of it sometimes; the news was good, back then,<br />at showing something live for a long time.<br />but we had to go to school or work the next day and we had no recording devices.)<br />was all the details, like you are really there; science fiction come to life.<br />I don't think that could be boring for anybody who has any interest in this at all.<br />Man going to another world for the first time and you are really there.<br /><br />I blame myself for not having this sooner because I didn't check back since<br />my first attempt in 2001 when I got a six VCR tape set, which was done like a public relations<br />docu-drama filled with speeches and cheering set to music, with only about 20% of it \\"on the moon\\" footage,<br />and that, highlights and the moon buggy.<br /><br />This has been around since 2004, so I'm lucky I got this at all, because there is only<br />one vendor still offering this and I was wondering even about that when I got it late.<br />So, no one may even care about another review at all.<br /><br />I haven't looked at all of this but some disappointments so far;<br />There is no commentary or audio that matches the video (mostly a noise),<br />for the onboard camera footage to the moon, what little there is, on disc one.<br />(Someone did see a flash on the moon!)<br />Just when they undock to decend to the moon, they put the camera to the window,<br />and we see the lunar landscape for a short while and than point the camera at a console<br />and we only hear them talk about...WHAT THEY ARE SEEING! (Were they afraid of what we might<br />see on live TV? Remember that flash!)<br />At least on disc two they do show, with matching audio, most of the final 10 miles of travel to landing.<br /><br />*Also, for some reason, they can't show video while the buggy is moving.  Now that is disappointing.<br />I could see that from a distance, at least, on the VCR tapes.<br />They have echo audio, but with some general mission stills.<br />Amazing how there is no frame of refrence there; what seems like a hill, is a mountain.<br /><br />Just one little note about the mission...<br />When they first go out, EVA-1, it must be Schmitt because he talks to \\"Gene\\" (Cernan),<br />He never shuts up and has one problem or \\"mess up\\" after another.<br />I mean man, he was acting \\"Luney\\". (Note: I have that backwards; Cernan broke the fender.)<br />Seriously though, that was hard work.<br /><br />Added Note: Yes, there is quite alot of them setting up and carrying out experiments<br />but I would want the video we do have uncut because that buggy camera is panning<br />and zooming quite often.<br />*(but 16mm film footage does exist from the buggy while it is moving; I have seen<br />examples of it on documentaries on TV; why couldn't that have been included?)<br /><br />Those guys had to be totally psychologically balanced, because most of us would be more nervous<br />if we were just doing a movie, while they didn't show any nervousness at all, even under the strain<br />of an unbelievable amount of work, which had to require being in amazing physical shape as well<br />even in their late 30's.<br />Two additional, really interesting events in this:<br />First,on an early Eva, near the ship (LEM), they see a flashy object decend quickly to the ground;<br />it's looks like a good distance (1000 ft.?), so it can't be that small.<br />One of them is startled but the other calmly says it's some foil??? just now<br />making it to the ground.<br />Second, Cernan really gets upset with something done on instructions from<br />mission control, on the last EVA.  He finds out they were carrying explosives on the moon buggy,<br />to be planted for a seismic reading, on the whole circular EVA, when it was actually suppose to be planted<br />near the ship, and could have been planted at the beginning of the EVA.<br />He gets a real attitude (He's gonna remember this!)with the boys back on mother Earth,<br />that he needs, to make sure that \\"thing\\" takes off from the moon.<br />Guts or what! Shee!e been planted at the beginning of the EVA.<br />He gets a real attitude (He's gonna remember this!)with the boys back on mother Earth,<br />that he needs, to make sure that \\"thing\\" takes off from the moon.<br />Guts or what!

0385534639|4.0|The circus, unlike any other is full of magic that only the performers can explain, and yet, they don't.  Every dream becomes a reality as you wander through the mystical tents.  Within these tents are realms that are unbelievably enchanting.<br /><br />This book is a love story surrounded by a tragedy all wrapped up in a spell bounding story that flows from beginning until end.  We see 2 young children being poised for the challenge of their life.  As they grow, so does their independent nature.  They are both drawn together by the Circus as they reach adulthood, not knowing why or who the other one is, yet knowing that somehow the circus is paramount in the challenge they know very little about.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern, the author, has a flare for the imagination, and is incredibly descriptive.  The characters are well developed, including the other characters that have their own stories on the side.  She goes into detail about the other players, and fully develops their stories as well, so that this novel has many facets. I liked how this book took place 100 years ago, and she really captured the essence of that time period.<br /><br />I had a hard time paying attention to this story in the beginning.  I can't pinpoint why, but I felt my mind wandering, and having to reread what I had already read. It took about 75 pages before I was hooked. This is the only reason I gave this 4 stars.  Other than that, I really liked the book.
B0002O06NA|5.0|About 2003 I was in a used bookstore in Knoxvegas, TN. I will not mention their name until they pay me to advertise. Books one side, and CDs on the other. They were playing Thickfreakness. I hear stuff all the time and who cares. But this was so good, I asked, and told them to give it to me. Still love it. I backed up and got Big Come Up. Not as good, but fine. Then this third effort is excellent. I still listen to these pretty regular. The direction has changed slightly and Rubber Factory is the last I bought.   No offense, but Akron??? White boys???? This stuff is mostly gritty as sandpaper and made to be loud. You stomp your body in time and stick out your lip and at least bob your head. It is unsophisticated, and fuzzythump. But I like it. Favorite songs: All Hands Against His Own; Grown So Ugly; Slack Shot Billy; Keep Me.
B002IW8V0E|5.0|This is a wonderful \\"time out\\" from the frenzy of daily living.  Just load your dixc palyer, put your feet up and enjoy.  It will be difficult to stay seated though, as the tunes are very infectious.  My friend and I found ourselves singing along, using a hair brush as a microphone, and laughing ourselves until our sides ached.  So, suspend reality and enjoy.
1416575464|5.0|If you have no idea where to start with decorating your house or living space, this book is definitely for you.  If you are comfortable with decorating but need a little guidance here and there, this book is great for that too.  Its resources at the back are a little out of date, but there's most likely no chance it will get updated since domino the magazine closed up several years ago.  If you need a book that is more up to date with resources I'd recommend design sponge.  Overall, this book is worth the money.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|THE LION KING remains, for an entire generation (mine, namely), Disney's masterpiece.  It is a grand epic, beautifully rendered, based around Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet.\\"  Note: it's interesting to return to this film after earning an M.A. in Literary Studies, especially having taken/taught Shakespeare courses.  The opening scene remains one of the most beautiful music-to-image scenes ever put on film, and the voice acting (with the possible exception of an oddly-flat Matthew Broderick) is top-notch (Jeremy Irons's Scar is still absolutely terrifying).  The music is among the best of any Disney film.  The appeal to both children and adults has not faded one bit.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presents LION KING as it has never been presented before: the images are crisp, the sound is sharp.  The bonus features contain an amusing blooper real (yes, it's actually funny, not just contrived); alternate scene story boards; a tribute/making-of piece (featuring casual, anecdotal interviews from everyone ranging from cast members, to the producers, to Julie Taymor); and other tidbits that will appeal to lifelong fans.  The gist of this re-release is, THE LION KING isn't just another animated film.  It's a masterpiece, a true classic, one that appeals to audiences of all ages.  Take the success of the theatrical 3D release; almost 20 years later, it's still enchanting audiences.  And \\"enchanting\\" is the perfect word: rendered in brilliant high definition, THE LION KING has never been more mesmerizing.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Get over yourselves and buy the set. Sure there is CG stuff you hate, and a line of dialogue you hate, but while you are watching a VHS of your favorite film you are missing out on some nice looking (albeit \\"modern\\" *cough* crushed *cough*) transfers and excellent surround sound.
B004GHBQCE|5.0|I own all the Johnny Cash American Recordings and have listened a great deal to them all. All 6 albums are good, although my least favorites are the first and fifth ones. Of the whole lot, still, this is the one to take to a desert island.  A Man Comes Around is recorded at a time Cash's health is getting worse. One senses the urgency in delivering the tunes and yet having the strength and power to fulfill such a mission. As on Unchained and Solitary Man, Cash took many cover songs and made them his own. Cases in point are songs like U2's One and Tom Petty's I Won't Back Down. On this album Cash really pushed the envelope, taking even very well known classics and making them, for those who hear them, in a sense his own.  The power is evident on the opening title track in which Cash melds together quotations from the bible forming a coherent song about the approaching hand of death; he obviously means business. The following track, Hurt, is, of all things, a Nine Inch Nails cover in which Cash changed the lyrics slightly. The vocal in the song makes it so poignant that the original songwriter has admitted (in a complementary way) that Cash basically stole it from him and made it his own. What follows are mostly eclectic covers done in a tender and yet forceful manner. There is not a single weak tune on it, no need for a remote control for this one. The scaled down version of Bridge Over Troubled Water is worth paying special note to, the text comes much more to life as opposed to the more produced version done by Simon & Garfunkel.  This album is among only a handful of albums released during the last 20 years I rate, from start to finish, as being close to perfection. If you want something more than a Johnny Cash compilation, this is the one to pick

Perfect GPS, easy to plug it into your computer, I use it for a backup of my navigation when we travel with our Sailing Vessel and when I drive my car to travel also. Great and very useful item. Good quality.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|This review is based solely on a New Hope Blu Ray version. I really could care less about the small changes Lucas made.  In my opinion the film  does not look any better than the DVD releases. If you want the bonus disks go for it. Personally, I would save my money.

1582701709|1.0|Catholics, and all Christians, must realize that this book contradicts our faith, and not just a little.  There are numerous problems that Christians must be aware of.  Like all good Law of Attraction books, it starts off with a motivational style preaching, revealing that you can have a lot of money, the perfect relationship, a huge house, and anything you want just by thinking right.  While positive thought can help you in life, there is a limit, a limit this book crosses, and then some.<br /><br />**Problems with the Secret**  This book teaches:<br /><br />+ That Jesus was an affluent millionaire who would make modern millionaires jealous.<br />+ That WE HUMANS ARE GOD: \\"You are God in a physical body. You are Spirit in the flesh.  You are eternal life expressing itself as You. You are all power.  You are all wisdom.  You are all intelligence.  You are perfection\\" (Byrne, 164).  Not only is this blasphemy for a Christian, it's just seriously erroneous).<br />+ Monism, or the interconnectedness of all things:  \\"We are One. We are all connected, and we are all part of the One Energy field, or the Supreme Mind, or the One Consciousness, or the One Creative Source.  Call it whatever you want, but we are all One\\" (Byrne, 162). This is a Eastern Hindu/Buddhist belief, not a Christian one.<br />+ The Law of Attraction (LOA)!  The LOA proclaims that everyone's sufferings are a result of their own negative thinking.  This movement asserts that people attract everything to themselves, good or bad, simply by how they think, by the vibrations of their minds.  All suffering on this earth including natural disasters, sexual abuse, car accidents, etc. is our own fault because of our own negative thinking.  For example, The Secret states; \\"The law of attraction says that like attracts like, and so as you think a thought, you are attracting like thoughts to you\\" (Byrne, 7).... \\"You're going to immediately say, I didn't attract the car accident. I didn't attract this particular client who gives me a hard time.  I didn't particularly attract the debt.' And I'm here to be a little bit in your face and to say, yes you did attract it\\" (27-28).<br /><br />The LOA touts that we can achieve 'anything' we desire, and that we are the god of own life.  The sky is the limit.  After all, since we are divine, our thoughts are all-powerful, and we attract to ourselves whatever we think, good or bad.  Here are some more of many problematic quotes:<br />- \\"Like Aladdin's Genie, the law of attraction grants your every command\\" (68).<br />- \\"We are the creators, not only of our personal destiny, but ultimately, we are creators of ultimate destiny. We<br />are the creators of the Universe\\" (160).<br />- \\"There is no blackboard in the sky in which God has written your purpose, your mission in life... So your purpose is what you say it is.  Your mission is the mission you give yourself.  Your life will be what you create it as, and no one will stand in judgment of that, now or ever.  You get to fill the blackboard of your life with whatever you want\\" (177-178).  Oh really?  No one will stand in judgment of us?  The Catholic Creed states \\"Jesus will come to judge the living and the dead.\\"  Notice that The Secret replace the true God with Self.  Books like this usurp the place of God, elevating humans to a place of divinity with \\"limitless powers.\\"  The Self becomes God, and this is one reason of MANY more why this book should not be read or subscribed to by Christians.  END REVIEW.<br /><br />--- Here is some more information on the extremes in this line of thinking for people who care to know:<br />The belief in the LOA is a dangerous kind of thinking.  It often causes hard core New Ager practitioners to ignore all of the world's problems and sufferings, while attempting to create a perpetually positive bubble around them.  If thinking negatively attracts negative circumstances and events to oneself, the mindset is not to be bothered or weighed down by other people's sufferings or negative circumstances.  After all, it is believed that the more one thinks about others sufferings or takes notice of them, the more they are then adding to the suffering by thinking about it while simultaneously attracting it to themselves.  Best policy: avoid all negative thoughts, feelings and situations like the plague.  One can easily see how self-serving this worldview is.  Jesus suffered for us and gives us a model to follow.  As Christians, we are called to love and serve others, to reach out to our brothers and sisters in need (James 2:14-18).  Our Salvation depends on it (Mt. 25:31-46).is believed that the more one thinks about others sufferings or takes notice of them, the more they are then adding to the suffering by thinking about it while simultaneously attracting it to themselves.

Besides teaching individual tangles, Sandy shows how to use them, and extend using different media other than pen and paper. I was thrilled with this book and refer back to it often.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|My wife was thrilled to get this DVD set for Christmas when I gave it to her. She had caught part of the first season then every episode since. This allowed her to watch them all from the start of season one. She is a huge Mad Men fan. The packaging was more then adequate for the DVD case. Comes with a clear plastic outer layer with the man men silhouette printed on it. If you are wanting to have all the seasons of Mad Men, or to dive into Mad Men this is where I'd start!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend. As I started asking around, every person whom read this series did so in a week. Basically, they couldn't put it down.  I'm mid-way through this book and couldn't agree more. By Sunday, I will be done with the series. Absolutely a fantastic book that does a great job of mixing primal survival with new-age technology with a main character that is easily related to.  Get the book!
B00062PN6I|5.0|While I may only be a teenager, I have gone through more pairs of headphones than I can count. These are the cheapest I have ever owned, but by far the best (I've bought $120+ sets of headphones, music is important to me). The bass is incredible for all types of music, I generally listen to rock and dubstep, but it is good for pop and other genres. I tend to break headphones that I own (more like the cords, but whatever) but these have lasted me more than 3 years. If you are looking for a cheap, high quality and durable set of headphones I would STRONGLY recommend these.
073933235X|3.0|Unless you are a Bourdain fan, his constant preening and literary strutting will become tiresome really fast.  However, despite the Bourdain taint, the book does offer an interesting glimpse into the life of a line cook and the assorted pecking order of a commercial kitchen.  Worth a listen for the background/insight into New York's culinary underbelly.
B003UESJFG|3.0|I gave this rating 3 stars for 2 reasons.  I would give the seller and Amazon.com 5 stars because the product arrived just as expected in the time promised. The purchase was suburb as far as customer service is concerned.  However, the movie itself would be lucky to get 1 star. I had high hopes for this movie and have loved other Dreamworks productions. This movie did not live up to expectations by a long shot. I will think twice before purchasing a movie that I have not yet seen. Rent it, waste two hours, and move on with your life.
