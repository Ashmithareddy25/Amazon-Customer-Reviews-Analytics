B008Y212PI|4.0|Nothing very demanding, just fun.  Doesn't take full concentration.  Very gentle but compulsive.  It was free when I downloaded it so bargain.
B0071MDA2U|5.0|This sequel does number one in the series justice. I didn't want to put my Kindle down. The plot thickens....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I happened upon this book and tried a sample on a whim - and could.not.put.it.down.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I had to put it down at certain moments because I just couldn't be emotionally wrecked.  Yes this is touted as a YA book, but it is universal.  I am recommending to EVERYONE.<br /><br />And while, they often disappoint, I am looking forward to the movie adaptation.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|The plot of this novel is so intriguing and creative. A mind bending twist on love. Yet much of what takes place in the book mirrors where we are as a society and a culture. Great read!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book is one of the most intriguing books that I have read in a long time. Very captivating, and keeps you wanting more. I would most definitely recommend it
B006CHML4I|1.0|This thing looks nice but doesn't even come close to keeping time. It's off by hours. Too bad, Seiko used to have a good name for well made durable watches. Either this is a knock-off or they've really gone down hill. I'm returning it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Simple and fun. My only complaint would be that the later stages and vehicles are a little too pricey,unless you do not mind spending real money on game currency
B002WV5A9G|1.0|I recieved the DVD on time but it was for code 5 not 1 My dvd player acceped the disk but my computer wood not. To watch it on my laptop /I will have to change the reagon. Not a good idea. For the price of the dvd is less than the s/h fees I will nor return it.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|These are like the Original end of the world flicks.  They are fun, Awesome and Violent what more would you want?
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I love these guys.  Always have.  They have many great tunes and their is something to really love about their catalog, as its \\"mostly\\" pretty killer.  This disc is however the first one since a few tunes on Octavarium and (on the whole) Train Of Thought...that I have really liked in years.  We all know these cats (and I love Mangini) are killer players...but I love their \\"pop\\" side...and it shines through all of their prog glory on this disc.  If u dig what I am talkin' about...go buy this one...it's their best in years...especially in the vocal melody department! :)
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I had this app for several weeks and it worked great. I loved that I could add my own music.  Then one day my Kindle Fire stopped keeping time. I tried to reboot my Fire but nothing worked. The app seemed to be keeping time so I didn't think it was this app. All my other apps seemed to be sluggish and I thought my Kindle was dying. Then I tried to set the alarm and it never went off. So then I watched the clock and noticed it was skipping second and not keeping accurate time. After trying different things I decided to uninstall My Alarm Clock.  Now my Kindle Fire is back to its perfect self.
B00DCRE7M0|4.0|First off...this is NOT his third solo disc...its number 5 or 6.  That said, yes there is odd things happening here and no the scream vocals are not necessary at all as the tunes stand well on their own.  In all honesty, this disc is better than the new Dream Theater disc...check it out!
B0020BUWX2|2.0|Like others have said, I wanted to love this book. Foreman's writing is clear and beautiful. The premise seemed interesting and Mia's choice to stay or go promised a thought-provoking story. How wrong I was.<br /><br />Here's what I just couldn't accept from this book:<br /><br />1. The whole premise of this novel is Mia's choice: to stay or to go. Mia doesn't dwell on this choice for more than a few lines. Mia doesn't have any kind of deep internal struggle over her decision to live or die. She just floats around the hospital, remembers things about her past, and then her \\"decision\\" is almost decided for her with no real effort on her part. What a disappointment.<br />2. The characters simply aren't relateable. I didn't care about any of them. They were all \\"types\\": perfect, unflawed, even boring.<br />3. Foreman throws in a large number of scenes that were only in the book to convince the reader to care for the characters. Also, there is so much summary in these scenes that I found myself skipping ahead. I wasn't convinced and they weren't interesting.<br /><br />I was unimpressed and annoyed with this novel. It could have been so much more. Maybe the boring characters, heavy summary, and the lack of Mia's big decision won't bother you. They were enough for make me roll my eyes through most of the novel, though.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It draws you in and that's rare. I enjoy it. It's good for a short play here and there but if u want to play for an extended period of time, you'll have to spend some dough.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not put this book down!  So many twists and turns!! Didn't want this book to end.  I wanted to keep reading about these characters.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was the best move but better book  that why I thought it was the best book I have ever read
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best game ever.l can not help but love it!so many levels and four worlds it is awesome
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Just like the first book this one draws you in and won't let go, not that you want it to. A must read especially if you have read the first one. Addictive! Thankfully there are three more in the series but I hope Mr.Martin will write a sixth and a seventh etc.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Read this many years ago and loved it. Picked it up again recently after reading Jonathan Yardley's review of the 50th anniversary edition in the Washington Post. Still a terrific book.  Contains all the things that make LeCarre a great author:  spies, intrigue, love, and betrayal.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like calculator plus because it helps me with my homework. I also like it because it is really easy ...
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|I love all the songs on this album, except maybe Biting Down. Even then I think it's just a personal choice, because the song certainly isn't bad.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Amazing  much better then I expected l play it all the time  and it is worth waiting for item/ dragons in the game!!!!!
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|I have owned many cases in my time, I would have to say that this is definitely one of my favorite. Slim case that is made of high quality material, provides excellent protection while not interfering with any of the functional buttons. The color options make this a fantastic case, all around.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Percy Jackson is great for readers who like fantasy and realistic fiction. It's entertaining and educational because it teaches you Greek mythology in a fun way! And it's shows you how the Greek gods would act if they were here.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading the next series of Olympians
B008Y212PI|5.0|I can't stop playing this game, it's very addictive &amp; so much fun that I have been playing it for hours.
0399162097|5.0|This book was a great blend of good writing, morality, ethics, character development and symbolism.  The writer is passionate and clever, and I just enjoyed every word in this book.  The storyline is completely unique, and poses difficult questions concerning motives, intellect and emotions. I will think about this book for a long time!
B002L4QP0M|3.0|As mysteries go, this one is not bad.  It didn't keep me on the edge of my chair, but it has some suspenseful moments and it builds some care for the main xcharacters -- not intense care, but enough to make me want to finish the book.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a very relaxing game that still requires some thought. I like trying to figure out the picture that will be behind the puzzle shape
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great movie. The acting was good. The story line was great. Would want to see more starship vs starship scenes so hopefully next one.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Out of nowhere, some programmer chose to sprinkle blue boxes throughout my notes randomly. I'm given no way to get rid of them. If other features were not serving me adequately I would give this a one star. If I learn of an alternative I will take it.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Just what you'd expect from Stephen King. Just scary enough to keep you reading on the edge of you seat.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I LOVE this game, each time you play it you get something new and interesting. Adjust the music to fit your mood, or let it play something completely random and awesome.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It's a cute game and is good game to pass the time. It's one of my top games to play
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This really gets you to thinking! It's fun and addictive! I wasn't sure what the game really was about until I played it but now I am hooked!!!
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Matilda is one of my guilty pleasures, from the great soundtrack with Rusted Roots contribution to Danny Devito's entertailing narration, to the adptation of Dahl's fantasy. It's a fun upper.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Being a fan of the walking dead since the first season, couldnt let this one go...<br />The quality of the zombies head is awesome, very detailed and solid, on the shelves this one looks awesome.<br /><br />The only thing to take care its the place behind the aquarium where you put the series box, cause the room is tight and it can mark the box with two lines, so be careful when placing it!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout is my hero. Excellent book excellent message everyone should read it I have already told all my friends and family to check it out.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This is a great app that will help anyone stay organized and get things done! I use this app for everything. From collaborating with my coworkers, to making grocery lists with my wife, to easily bookmarking future camping products I want to buy from Amazon.<br />I love this app so much that I decided to write a usermanual about it.  [...]<br />If you want tot get the most out of this app, this manual will help. You can learn all the tips and tricks that will make it go from a great app to a must-have app.
0792164903|5.0|I have always liked this movie and I am glad that I found it. Thank you for getting it to me quickly.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've played this game so much the ads don't bother me. I'm addicted! My husband is jealous! AND IT'S FEE!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simple. very simple, easy to use, works great on kindle, its amazing quality. definitly a must - have app. if you dont already have this app, you should get it because it is really sjmple and effictive for simple math
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Awesome book. Couldn't put it down. A must read. Reminded me of the hunger games with a different twist. Can't wait to read the sequel.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I kind of liked it but the problem is that I can't find any meanings or words in this dictionary
B008Y212PI|5.0|Once I did the tutorial it didn't take long to get hooked on the game. It's enough of a challenge for me but still possible to solve the puzzles without giving up.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great game. Using the largest grids to start. Lots of fun. Love that it is connected to making pictures
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Just like all the other books, it just goes on and on and never gets anywhere. I don't think the author has a clue how to end this saga.  I was particularly bored by all the business surrounding Daenarys in Meereen.  Why doesn't he get someplace with her?
B006ZT47O0|5.0|This is one of the best albums from the band.  While not as good as &#34;Design Your Universe&#34; it is still a good listen.
B000274THQ|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite German movies and I would recommend it to anyone! Thank you for the speedy delivery!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett always captures the readers' attention with his development of characters and relationships. This book describes how and why WWI came about from the viewpoint of all the major countries involved. I got bogged down a little in some of the more detailed parts of the book involving political systems but that did not diminish my overall enjoyment of the book. Logo forward to the sequel.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My son loves minecraft and this is all he wanted for his birthday.  It is pretty expensive and really small. He was happy and that's all that really mattered to me.
B009GFEOY8|5.0|It's awesome I don't really get how to use it but I'll get it soon enough thanx. ITS REALLY GOOD
B0014GGVSO|5.0|I'm so happy with this purchase! I'm listening to it right now. It was in fantastic shape and the quality is great, top to bottom.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fun game to play for everyone I play it a lot me and my sister like this game
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Amazing story of evil that still exists today and how he managed to escape.  Hard to put this book down.  Would have enjoyed hearing more about how he managed to fit back into the world.... especially if he is doing well now.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would have to say this is my favorite Nicholas Sparks books. It took me a week and a half to get through (usually can read a book in a day or two). I would recommend this book if you haven't read any of his work
B008Y212PI|5.0|A++++++++<br />Really cool game. Wonderful my son like it<br />Wish more levels<br />Good logic.  It is really a awesome experience<br />Good job
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|Husband loved it, he has almost every possible vampire movie and really liked this one.  Good price and great movie
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read all of Stephen King's novels. I am a fan. Yet, I could understand how, in the past, some critics did not take him seriously as a novelist - he used to rely a little too much on commercial, contemporary references (short cuts to mise en scene and character development) and short, language - happy riffs on personalities and subcultures. That was then (and I never totally agreed); this is now.  No excuses, no halfway &#34;good reads.&#34; While the current book is heavy on AA culture, it fits the character and is well-balanced in the story. I believe AA saved Mr. King's life and he is entitled to his hymn, particularly one as well written and joyous as this. I hope he got as great a sense of completion from writing this novel as his protagonist did from re-encountering his past (no give aways).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love!!! This mini series!!! Great acting! Awesome story line! I'm completely obsessed! When does season 4 start?? I can't wait!
B00DCX08MW|5.0|I have had this game for a couple months and have yet to get tired of it. There are only about 12 missions or so but the free flight is great. Definitely worth the buy!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|this book was the best read for me in quite awhile.  I'm not an avid reader, so for me to read a book, much less within a week, is highly unusual.  My husband reads constantly, he couldn't believe a book held my interest that long.  The title was catchy and after reading the cover and other reviews I went for it.  I loved it to say the least.  Talked about it at work with the girls, they couldn't wait to hear how it ended.  Looking forward to another one by this author.
B00005MP58|5.0|I spent a lot of hours growing up reading this book and when this version came out I watched it about once a week. I HATE the newer Keira Knightly version of this movie. This is BY FAR the best film version of the book out there. The dialogue essentially comes straight from the book and the costumes, scenery, and everything are historically accurate.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|There are not very many really good point and click adventure games. FIRE MAPLE GAMES are about as good as they get.  I'm always disappointed when it ends. The graphics are exceptional. The puzzles range from &quot;obvious&quot; to &quot;have to use my brain&quot;.  A couple of puzzles had me &quot;puzzled&quot;, but I knew when I found the right clue or object, I would be able to solve it. I had to use one clue and then was disappointed  I gave in so easily. One very important thing is there are no hidden pictures. That alone should give them 5 stars. If you like &quot;find the object then figure out how to use it&quot;, you will not be disappointed. WELL DONE. Your games never disappoint.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is perfect for children. Everyone in the world<br />should play this game. it's just to good it's just to good
B00E0SX118|5.0|I love this movie it's cute and funny and captures the attention of all ages. I can't wait to own this movie all watch it everyday. I also heard that they are planning to make a sequel and I plan to see and own the movie if they do. love love this movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game drew my two year old daughter in and I had to wait for her to take a nap before I got my kindle back
0345528581|4.0|This book is awesome! I'm really out of shape and large, and I can use this book, and if I keep using it and get my body in good shape, I will still be able to raise the bar and do the more difficult exercises. The only issue I see is that there are exercises that actually take some kind of &#34;equipment&#34;. There is an exercise called a &#34;let me in&#34; which requires pulling yourself up with a door. I'm NOT going to do that with the doors in my 100 year old house! I could feel the strain on the hinges. I figured out a way of doing a similar exercise to a let me up with crutches so I was working the same muscles, and I bought a pull up bar, but still. Otherwise though, this book is great.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Omb I love how this alarm doesn't even fall into lock mode while the alarm app is tuning I think this is just the beat part!!!!!
B000OVLINI|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind was a recommendation from a book club I have just joined.  What a great start to a new group! I really enjoyed the rich writing and the vivid descriptions of the setting, but those things do not replace a compelling story that is well told, and the success of this book (for me) lies in the variety of characters. This is essentially a mystery, but Zafon uses his quirky cast of characters to great effect, bringing humor and wit to the narrative. I am a fan of intelligent fiction and I recommend this book to anyone who is not afraid of a complex but rewarding reading experience.
B00FFHG6KQ|4.0|All of key players names aren't being called just the number. The pelicans are still called the hornets and the sound needs work, it goes in and out. it looks just like 2k13 playing it which I have on my mobile phone. also the stat boxes that show for a player at the free throw line are empty and it is impossible to win a game on the road and winning at home is a breeze. The AI needs to be evened out. Also their is no commentary at all. These problems can be fixed with an update from the publisher as I experienced most of these problems from last year's version. Other wise good but im eagerly awaiting an update!<br /><br />Update: since the most recent update the game works well, but in multi season you all added the East vs. West All-star game which is a great addition might I add but once you hit play game it force closes and their is no way to advance through and actually be able play that specific game. If you could find a fix for it that would be wonderful. By the way this is a great game for a mobile platform and you all just keep making it better and better Great job and please Don't stop.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|When I read about this it sounded like it would play anything but unless it has the icon it will not play. I read that Google or someone has restricted it streaming anything and has limited what applications can work with this device! Kind of disappointing!also quality of videos was not great either!
B005Z6YHEY|4.0|This was a very informative book. I learnt a lot from reading about the plasticity of the brain.<br />Some of the information wasn't relevant but there's no problem with skipping A chapter.
B008Y212PI|3.0|This is a bit addictive, I really like it a lot. I recommend it if you like games like minesweep. I got it free so totally worth it.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I'm enjoying this book and am still reading it. It is well written & easy to pick at any time.<br />I'm looking forward to the outcome.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I had a hard time getting into this book but then after about 50 pages I was caught up in the web of this fascinating story and its characters.  I have read several books on North Korea and don't doubt that most of this is closer to the truth than we care to imagine.  This book was a work of art, and I had a hard time putting in down.  Well deserving of all its awards.  Its characters were well developed but I had a hard time putting a face on these people, because in that country apparently everyone is a number and no one really matters.  Truly fascinating reading.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|I think this is closer to FS/LS and Justified than 20/20 Part 1... but the songs are great anyways. Murder is perfect (Jay Z is unnecessary though). Cabaret includes a good verse by Drake, and Drink You Away is something unexpected but i hope it becomes a single (i love it). Not A Bad Thing is one of my favorites, it gets better every time. There just one or two songs that i don´t find as good as the others, Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want) and True Blood.
B00DVKOYBM|1.0|Awesome game.  Except when it cuts off and takes your coins. They charge $2-$50 for pool coins (if you decide to get more) that if you are unlucky will just disappear and you will NOT get it back!  Was going to give it 5 stars til I wrote this comment with the 20 word min and got me thinking. This game is really fun but the glitch is extremely frustrating ( I have lost over 300,000 pool coins for nothing).  And when I contacted them they just gave me a generic answer that did not have anything to do with the issue. So the game play when working well I would give a 5. But due to this issue being apart of this game as a whole I give it 1 stars.  Definitely do NOT buy chips because of this problem and their customer support does not care.
0060736267|5.0|This book has more in it than the movie, it is a classic and a must have for personal library....the movie lacks a lot of the crux that the novel has!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the best books I have picked up and I am only 13 1/2  it is a really good book.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Easy to install and good graphics. The white noise feature is perfect. Growing up in the city and now living in the very quiet country, the noise helps me fall asleep. I also like the &quot;sleep&quot; feature, the white noise or music, if you choose, turns off after a set time.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|love the story line, the characters, how every season is new unexpected plot lines. def recommend this if you have the stomach for violence
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  it is simple and easy to use.  thank you. I would play more games like this one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to a great series.there needs to be more series like this one.<br />I think 's. Collins needs to do another.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|what a fun game. I figured for free its gonna be dumb or you have to pay to get anywhere. yes, you can purchase stuff, but you don't have to. Download this now and have some fun.!
B00594XOZU|2.0|I've used kik on my kindle for a while and normally it works fine but recently it won't let me log in and doesn't alert me when I get messages.I've tried logging in multiple times and it keeps saying error the app need to be fixed.
B007FJUP2W|2.0|I love the look and once I actually have them on they fit fine. However getting them on is near impossible, the opening is just too small and there is no stretch to it. I know they are not the most expensive shoes out there but still for the price I thought they would not make such a foolish mistake. Annoyed to say the least.
0765325950|5.0|Overall the book was excellent. Yes there are quite a few grey areas but for Sanderson to finish it with this last book took some doing. It is quite grueling at times and an emotional roller coaster ride. When characters die you can't help but be saddened or angered, they have been a part of our lives through Mr. Jordan's books for so many years.<br /><br />###spoiler alert### Do not read past this if you haven't read the book. I will try to keep it vague though.<br /><br />I have went through several discussion boards to try and figure out the ending. What I figured out was this, you may disagree but this works for me. Rand's new power allows him to use the power of his will to make things happen. This explains his death to some degree. Him and a certain forsaken were tied together in several ways, I often wondered if they were not one in the same or joined somehow in the past. The ending kind of fuels my suspicions.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|My HDMI port wore out on my laptop so I bought this incomplete piece of crap. I've used it for a few weeks now and it's usable,but limited.Many small bugs and the text is blurry on the TV.
B005PK1G76|4.0|This is so much better than those 2 cup holders that came with the graco snap and go. It holds multiple drinks and items of any size and is easily detached. looks nice and well made. One of my new favorite baby items.<br /><br />Update: It worked great for the snap and go (which I used until 15 months), but I got a city select baby jogger and it's too small. I can still use it temporarily but I plan on getting something else. I may pass it on or try to find another use for it (and if I do, I'll update)
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I would suggest every high school student read this book.  If you love this country and what it says it stands for, what Abraham Lincoln lived and died for, what George Washington gave of his blood and treasure for, what countless American soldiers fought and died for, you need to make sure the ideal isn't stolen by the powerful folks who have always counted on the apathy and ignorance of the populace to whom this country is supposed to belong.  mgrfromutah
B00C5R8364|5.0|Unquestionably one of his best novels.  It was exciting, accurate and kept my attention.  The places the characters visited and things that happened to them were excellent.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I used to love kik until now... I used to use it all the time but deleted it and tried to re download it. When I did and tried to log into my account it just loads forever and then says it is taking longer than expected and to try again later!!!! Fix this!!!!
B0090SI4LU|1.0|Wow this came and went without so much as a spark. i forgot all about it. I still thought it hadn't been released. Wished it hadn't, what a waste of time. So much for letting my friend pick the movie.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is an absolute great clean app on phone or tablet. I have it on both. At work I play it on breaks and at home durring commercials.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|It takes more than a handsome cast of studs to make a good Star Trek feature film. I was gaga over the first one even if it included a big dud of a villain in Nero. This new one, inexplicably titled \\"Into Darkness,\\" moves to re-establish the trinity of Kirk/Spock/Bones as Kirk/Spock/Uhura. And that's the good news! Look, Nichelle Nichols was an inspiration to me and one of the main reasons I pursued a career in the entertainment industry (I did fine, but I did grow tired of the rampant drug abuse that permeates that field). As much as Uhura was a \\"force\\" to be reckoned with, using her femme charms in part V \\"The Final Frontier\\" to devastating effect, these new movies have transformed Uhura into a powerhouse. I love the scene in \\"Into Darkness\\" where she stands her ground while confronting a demonic Klingon warrior. Oh but they paired her as a subservient girlfriend to Mr. Logic himself, Spock. Even Sybok would likely have found her too headstrong, haha!<br /><br />I wish they had done something other than essentially remake The Wrath of Khan, but what else is new? I will buck the current trend among femmes my age (or shall I say \\"vintage\\"? *wink*) and say that I do not understand the fuss over Benedict Cumberbatch. Great name, blank-slate screen presence. He's playing, well John Harrison (hardy-har-har), and may I simply say I have never seen a bigger turkey in the role of \\"villain\\" throughout all Trek movies. In fact, I found myself longing for Eric Bana to show up as Nero and put this wuss in his place!<br /><br />So while Chris Pine, Z. Quinto, and above all Zoe Saldana continue to re-define the old characters and make them their own, these filmmakers need to polish up their approach to crafting a seriously fearsome bad guy.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan- I've read and loved almost everything he's written, outside of his children's and young-adult pieces... And I think that's why this book was such a let-down. Compared to many other authors, this is a well-written book: technically sound with a somewhat entertaining plot. Compared to other Neil Gaiman works, The Ocean at the End of the Lane comes up lacking. I'm familiar with the Gaiman who weaves stories that I can't predict the end of- that keep me up all night wondering where the plot will take me. I'm used to characters I connect with- characters that I viscerally love or hate, and that I have to change my mind about throughout the book (I still don't know how to feel about Wednesday from American Gods).  The fine crafting of American Gods, Anansi Boys, Neverwhere, and Stardust is missing from Ocean at the End of the Lane, and all attempts to convey the \\"magic\\" of youth seem lackadaisical, predictable, and even whiney at times... \\"My childhood was hard because I liked books and not sports and everyone judged me for it, wahhhhh.\\" Thanks for describing every nerd's childhood ever and making it seem terrible. (For the record- I read a lot as a kid, had few friends, and my childhood was awesome.)<br /><br />Of course there's more to it than this, but if you're on the fence and want to read a story where Mr. Gaiman captures the essence of childhood wonderment and magic, just re-read Stardust. And if you're thinking about using this as a gateway into the works of Neil Gaiman, I would recommend the other works I've listed.
B005LAIIN0|2.0|There are a few thrilling sequences, especially near the beginning as all holy heck breaks loose in Philadelphia (the city of brotherly love? Not anymore, heehee!). As a red-blooded femme I don't have complaints regarding the presence of Mr. Brad Pitt in the leading role - so handsome! But his spouse, played by a very excellent actress named Mireille Enos, is short-changed with a role that begins as important and slowly dries up. A metaphor for the female life cycle? Perhaps. I know they included a femme soldier who is brave (up to a point), but even she seems to vanish following a hairy episode aboard a jetliner. I enjoyed her performance too!<br /><br />When they say this is a \\"popcorn movie,\\" boy do they ever mean it.
B000W453KQ|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever, and it arrived at my home just two days after I ordered.<br />Excellent service, and the movie is perfect. Great price, too.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I  love this game. I downloaded another one like it but this one  I  way easier. It's fast paced and keeps you thinking
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|To start this all off...let me first say that this is the first book by this author that I have read. I read a review that was done by a blogger I follow and 9 times out of 10 I agree with her thoughts on a book so I usually know if I will like a book by her review. SO I was looking forward to this one.<br /><br />I got started on this book and right away in that first chapter I was excited to see what was going to happen... than... we get another person in the next chapter... the next chapter is about yet another person. I actually did read the synopsis on this one so I will have to say that I was lost and confused at first I had no idea that this book was going to be written in 3 different points of view. That each chapter was going to be about another person, and each chapter would jump to another. I just wanted Cecilia's story and every chapter I would finish I would get frustrated if the next one wasn't her. I am not usually one to start with a negative aspect but this is a big \\"I'm not a big fan\\" moment. I was confused because not once does it let you know that it is written in 3 points of view. It lets you know that the secret that Cecilia's husband has affects these other people BUT that's it. I'm usually never one to put a book down, I will push through and finish it up, but I had really thought about just walking away from this one because I just didn't understand the connection or why it was portrayed as one womans story when it isn't written that way.<br /><br />Now that being said, the issue that I had with the writing style (as far as the jumping around goes). I am glad that I finished the book. For me, and anyone who knows me knows I am horrible at guessing what is going to happen,  and once again I wasn't able to figure out what the letter was about before she opened it. I had so many different ideas in my mind. I had about 6 different ideas in my mind. :)<br /><br />When it all came down to it and I finally finished the book, I would have to say that my absolute favorite part of the book was the very ending. That epilogue was awesome! I enjoyed the journey and to be 100% honest I really wish it was all written in just Cecilia's point of view.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Lots of fun. Very addicting. I like that it had a tutorial. The pictures a very pretty. I enjoyed the puzzles. World like to see more like them.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|We are all individuals with a different opinion read the book and then make your judgement. It amazes me how people base their decisions on the opinion of a total stranger. Me on the other hand, loved this book. It came into my life at perfect timing.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|good game not boring with more to do to keep active than most.  Battles give you something to do while waiting
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I choose this book because I had read some of the other books,and I like them. My rating is 5 stars. I think that there is nothing wrong with this book.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|I was very impressed with this film. Michael Bay, the director, was able to handle considerable visual complexity and technology and weave a vast amount of  visual stimuli into a comprehensible narrative with very clearly defined forces of good and evil.  There are several ideas that were generated for me as I watched. For example, as film making technology is able to produce increasingly realistic yet fantastic images does the story narrative have to take a more concrete and simple morality play structure so as not to overwhelm the viewer. The basic story narrative here is that a young man must struggle to gain and maintain the affection of the damsel in distress while his loyalty to others maintains a social bond that allows for heroic, world saving actions. In other words there are clear cut good guys and bad guys and this remains pretty clear so that the visual complexity does not overwhelm the viewer. The exact opposite of this would be a film based on a Jane Austen novel (Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma ) where characters are multifaceted and interact in a world of relatively very little action but there are multiple layers of interpersonal nuance.<br /><br />Yet the world of good and evil in Transformers: Dark of the Moon is made more interesting by humor, sexuality, and the tricks that the forces of good and evil both use to gain the upper hand. In fact it is this process of combatants using wit, strength, subterfuge, alliance, confusion, and trickery which makes up much of the action and extends the narrative. When watching boxing, we see two forces pounding each other and we watch for those strategic moves that will allow one of these forceful men to gain some advantage over the other. This film is very much in that line of thinking for the warring forces continually escalates their bombardment of each other yet for at least a 20 minute segment of the film the underdog uses wit to counteract the forces of evil that may appear at first to be insurmountable.<br /><br />The acting is delightful, much like a situation comedy. Even in the most frightful scenes the primary actors keep a cool Mona Lisa smirk on their faces. I have seen the Three Stooges look more distressed than the primary actors in this film. But don't get me wrong, this is not a bad thing, it just means that the story narrative including the vast perils faced by the characters are all part of world view in which the good guys always win.<br /><br />Maybe I am a kid at heart but every time one of the transformers changes from an automobile to a robotic monster my eyes jumped out of my head. I was transfixed as if seeing a miracle and questioned what part of the automobile became what part of the robotic creature. The premise that there might be alien creatures that are able to inhabit our computers, washing machines, blenders, and motorcycles and at will converting them into robotic gladiators was fascinating. The film is certainly worth viewing.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. The author grasps an amazing world. I read the Infernal Devices before this and they left me hungry for more. I know lots of people gave this bad ratings but I absolutely loved it.

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I don't think I've been this pleased with a fantasy book in years. Except for the fact that it ended, that was disappointing. A wholly engaging, entertaining, and very well written novel. I hope there will be more like this to come, and soon. All writers should aspire to this caliber of talent.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was pleased that setup was so easy.  Works with phone and computer.  Also requires power connection to HDMI connection.
B001E45XT4|4.0|At first when wearing this headset it was hurting my ears. After awhile it started to loosen up and the pain went away.<br />The sound quality is pretty good. As for the microphone, also good quality. People can hear me clear. Barely can hear static background. I been using these for awhile and finally the left side audio does not work anymore. The cable is pretty long. The built quality is great.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend it.
0316204366|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell sees the world through the eyes of an objective observer. He takes nothing at face value and in this book, he takes us behind the scenes of some well known, and unknown underdog stories.<br /><br />The fun thing about this book is that for most people the title would simply be a symbol of the little guy who doesn't stand a chance against some unbeatable giant, but Gladwell sees this classic story from an entirely different perspective. He shows us that *David* was clearly the superior fighter. He breaks it down so clearly that you see that Goliath simply didn't have a chance.<br /><br />Once he establishes this fundamental shift in perspective, he then dives into a series of stories of people who succeed not in spite of their adversities... but because of them.<br /><br />As always, Galdwell doesn't just base his positions on his own opinion, but based upon intensive research. For example, in a study of the greatest leaders of all time, he made a list of all of the people in the Encyclopedia Britannica who had more than two columns written about them. He then researched every name in the list to determine the percentage of them who lost a parent at a young age and was able to demonstrate that a disproportionate number of great leaders had indeed been from shattered families.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in his research in education, where he demonstrated solid reasons why emphasis on smaller class sizes and affirmative action were off target, and why aiming for Ivy League schools isn't always in the best interest of the student.<br /><br />Above all, Malcolm Gladwell has delivered another classic book that simply makes you think outside the box. In this particular book, he also makes it easier for you to look adversity in the eye and say... \\"thanks\\".
B0089LOG02|5.0|What can I say but that this story is excellent.  The Orphan Trains and their human cargo have been a fascination for me over several decades.  I have always wondered just why these children ended up abandoned, what efforts were actually made to ensure their health and safety, and what emotions these children felt.  This novel has supplied some answers to my questions and has deepened my interest in this part of American history.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Quality on blu-ray is outstanding, both picture and audio are impressive.  Each disk is loaded with special features. I picked up this set as I had never seen all the TOS films in order from start to finish and held a marathon the week after I bought it and loved it!  When you watch them all back to back you really appreciate how they flowed from one film to another in this arc the writers of each film carried across all 6 films.  You won't be disappointed by the quality.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Hard on these old eyes but is fun.  Taking longer than expected to finish one puzzle as some pieces look like others, but fun
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I see more than one thousand reviews are here. Let me keep this simple. I don't have a netflix account neither i use google video&music. I watch some youtubes but those are short clips. I do watch amazon prime videos but no chromecast apps are available for that. Still, as you know, these is a way though.<br />When you set up your chromecast, wifi connection is required even if you are using the wired lan cable. Here is the point.<br /><br />WIFI IS NOT REQUIRED AFTER THE INITIAL SETUP.<br /><br />The reason casting your chrome browser lags is this. When casting youtube, it's pretty much the dongle that is doing most of the job. That's why it works great. However, when you casting your browser, two way traffics are going on. That's why it lags. Most wireless connections are slower than wired lan. Well some hi-tech wireless would certainly beat wired but that's not for many of us. Then, if we can make at least one way faster, we can assume that casting with your browser would be much better.(I assume you know how to do it. 1)Get the chrome browser for PC 2) download the extension named as google cast 3) put folder's path on the browser 4) browse and run the file 5) click the extension on the right top and cast 6)if you are just casting the screen of your chrome then you don't need 3)and4))<br />Okay, once I set up, I took off my wifi usb adapter for my desktop and connect it with lan cable. Nothing fancy, just a simple cat5e cable. Do I have an expensive router? No way. Mine is refurbished Cisco Valet M20. Got it less than $20.<br /><br />My computer is a bit high-tech. But I assume it doesn't matter since my laptop returned the same result.<br /><br />The difference is huge. With two-way WIFI, I can't even make it with high 720p option on the chrome browser. The amazon video lags so bad that I had to set it to 480p. Playing local video files was worse. I played 2 gb 720p mkv file just FYI.<br />With wired and WIFI, it works great. I would say it's 90% perfect. Withwired cable, I can set it to extreme 720p and it still works great. NO lags whatsoever. amazon prime videos or local media files. Since I don't have 1080p files in my HDD, I couldn't test it. However, 720p mkv file worked just great. This means ANY STREAMING on your PC chrome will cast to your tv with the dongle without lagging. hulu, hbo, vemeo.. you just name it.<br /><br />I know the chromcast app on your PC will still ask for wifi connection. However, it works without it as long as you are connected to the same router.<br /><br />Well, hope this helps for those non-netflix users but still thinking about buying this.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|Listening to iTunes radio I heard a tune by Gregory Porter. I was wow'd. I don't often get excited by music with vocals but this tune just had something outstanding about it. I looked him up on Amazon and got one of his CDs, Be Good. What a great voice and set of arrangements. He's not one of those voices that stuns you with its power and range but instead with its depth and nuance and ability to convey a message beyond the words themselves.<br /><br />I guess if I had followed the Grammys I would have known who he was. But often the Grammys and I don't align. In this case we diverge again as I can't understand why he didn't win.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|First off, I don't think any superhero story ends up working well when the main problem is that the hero has lost his or her powers (or in this case the suit doesn't work properly).  We know the powers are eventually going to come back so there is no real drama/suspense.  In the meantime, we vicariously experience frustration (Why doesn't the suit work? Why didn't he stick with the old suit that worked?  Why didn't I just watch one of the previous better Iron Man movies?).<br /><br />Next, most good guy - bad guy movies are only as good as the bad guy is interesting.  Robert Downey Jr. is  a little bit of both and is constantly interesting to watch (not so much here as the previous movies), but he still needs a worthy rival.  I did not even understand the bad guy's motivation.  He wants to &#34;have the monopoly on terrorism&#34; (something like that), but why?  Because Tony Stark left him waiting on a roof?  This is his big revenge motive?  Iron man 2 had a revenge motive (not the most interesting motive), but at least it was for a lifetime of being cast out and perceived theft of ideas (I get how that would make someone a little obsessive).  I think that here they had an idea for the special effect (translucent fire stuff with regenerative properties) and then went from there.<br /><br />Robert Downey is so good in this role and the look of the movie is excellent as are its predecessors.  So you only need a decent story line to create a really good movie.  Here the story is abysmal and makes the new movie as dysfunctional as the new suit.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have indeed read \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\". Yep, that's the camp I belong to. Also, I totally loved it. Yep, that's the sub-camp I belong to.<br /><br />Though I am not much into fiction, I was mildly curious to find out how  Ms. Gilbert would walk out of memoir mode and segway into the world of fiction (not sure if this is her first fiction but it's the only one I have picked up).<br /><br />Would she be able to enrapture, intrigue and delight us with a tale borne out of her imagination, as she had with her own true story in \\"Eat, Pray and Love\\"?<br /><br />Well, the answer is a resounding yes!<br /><br />And by golly, does she have a tale to tell.<br /><br />Set in the 18th -19th century, the story revolves around Alma, the daughter of the very wealthy Henry Whittaker. From her father, Alma has inherited a penchant for plants. She spends most of her waking hours trying to make sense of the botanical world around her, perhaps in an attempt to understand her own existence. But through the course of her life, she is made to realize how little she knows about her own world, her own self.<br /><br />The story has been skillfully woven into a rich tapestry of adventure, emotions and science. Something also needs to be said about the amount of research that must have gone in; the book is peppered with facts that have been laid out in a manner almost poetic.<br /><br />\\"Alma learned to tell time by the opening and closing of flowers. At five o'clock in the morning, she noticed, the goatsbeard petals always unfolded. At six o'clock, the daisies and globeflowers opened. When the clock struck seven, the dandelions would bloom. At eight o'clock, it was the scarlet pimpernel's turn....\\"<br /><br />Facts infused with poetry or perhaps poetry infused with facts? Either way, you will be charmed!<br /><br />\\"The Signature of All Things\\" is right up there with \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\".But the fact that the book has been written by the Italian food eating, spirituality seeking, meditating, globetrotting Ms. Gilbert, you know the persona that I (we?) have come to associate with the author, has taken a backseat.<br /><br />As it should have.<br /><br />Now that's versatility!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love it! great graphics.  Plenty of different animal, scenery, and toys to buy for your village.  This game is a fantastic way to pass the time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love solitare. Love the graphics of this version. The only annoying thing is the pop ups after each game.<br />I now feel so competitive as I wonder how some people can have such high scores.

B008JFUO72|4.0|The movie itself is a 5 star, but I'm not here to review the actual movie. What I did not like about the DVD + Digital Copy is that the digital copy is not renewable on iTunes. After talking with several customer supports I discovered that the iTunes digital copy only comes in the Blu-Ray version. Outside of that everything is as expected.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really love this game.it's the best bingo game I played yet. I recommend this game to family and friends.

0060557818|4.0|Pretty sharp take on a &#34;yellow brick road&#34; adventure. What made this book stand out for me was the introduction to things that really exist but are buried in the past (abandoned Underground stops, the Smog of 1952). The characters were new - fresh & original. While reading the book, the play was showing locally at the Atlas and I had a chance to see it, too. The play did an amazing job of capturing the atmosphere and layers I'd imagined. After the play, I went on to finish the book - and while a lot of the story felt familiar then, there were some nice surprises that the book had to offer that were glossed over in the play (or omitted) - such as the class of golden rats or the spiraling effect of Down Street.  I especially enjoyed Hunter.  And the &#34;wardrobe&#34; moments at the start of the book where Richard finds a veil between himself and his 'real world' and again at the end of the book when he is torn between a want to go home and a deeper want to stay in his new life where he has (for better or worse) come alive.  Great read - I'll have to look up what I am told is a decent video series.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This was a fast paced read with several twists along the way. It was refreshing that the protagonist (Harry) is  a seriously flawed individual. He also happens to be an exceptional , though not always like able character.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Smart, funny and sexy!<br />But more than that, Gabriella by Alan Hardy is fun . . . really fun. It's a great read; this is erotica with a brain. Witty, brash and playful, we get to watch as a game within a game is played out among the classes and the coy cat and mouse of Jim and Gabriella all with the backdrop of cricket. Written by a skilled storyteller, this book is fast and easy and not one you'll be able to easily put down. My only disappointment was that there isn't another book available from this author, but I would imagine we'll be seeing lots more from Alan Hardy. 5-stars - highly recommended!
B0088T3B0G|5.0|Great acting, great plot, great twist at end.  Enjoyed the character development.  Kevin Spacey at his best.  Hadn't seen the movie in years, had my 15 yr old son & 20 yr old daughter watch & they enjoyed the movie as well.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Always nice to find a new author to love who already has other books published. I rarely stay up to late reading...this book was irresistible.

B000MD9UJC|1.0|This is a 11-6-2013 update to my previous review. I bought three of these for my AA MiniMag flashlight delivered on 9-30-13. So I've had these about 1 month. Initially, one of them had the bulb pins break off but two seemed to work OK until today. Then one flashlight just stopped working with this unit in it. Reinstalling the original MiniMag bulb worked fine.<br /><br />I suggest that you DO NOT purchase these as it's hit or miss. Now my miss is 2 out of three. They are UNRELIABLE and may work for a little while. It isn't worth the effort to try to make it work.<br /><br />This is my earlier review when my miss was only 1 out of three.<br /><br />I ordered three units to convert AA Mini-Mags to LED. Two worked and one broke. The light of the new LED is much brighter covering a much wider area than the original bulb. Amazon said they would refund my money for the broken one. When I couldn't get the LED of one to work using the method described below, I pulled it out to try it in another Mini-Mag and one of the two LED pins literally pulled out of the LED unit and is unusable.<br /><br />Before working with the LED, replace the reflective shield in the top part of the Mini-Mag so when the LED is working, you can screw it on. Just as before the replacement, screwing on the top all the way will turn off the flashlight. This kit is really the replacement of the original Mini-Mag light bulb with an LED bulb and a reflective shield in the top with a larger opening for the new LED bulb.<br /><br />The LED bulb is not easy to push into where the previous Mini-Mag light bulb was. For some reason, the replacement LED does not always work as reliably as the original bulb even though the two pins look the same. You can rock the LED from side to side and it might turn on and off indicating a contact problem. This does not occur with the original Mini-Mag bulb.<br /><br />To be sure the new LED bulb is working, insert it into the flashlight with batteries and the original screw-on end (not the replacement on-off end supplied). If the LED lights up just screw on the top. But if the LED doesn't light up, insert the original bulb to see if it is working. If the original bulb lights up, try the LED again. Rocking it back and forth may cause it to light up.<br /><br />You can leave on the original screw-on end or replace it with the new replacement on-off end. Frankly, the new on-off end can be confusing. The Mini-Mag will only light up with the top loosened AND if the new screw-on end in the ON position. If you loosen or unscrew the top as before the change, it will not light up if the screw-on end is in the OFF position. Likewise, if you press the screw-on end to be ON, it will not light up if the top is tightened - the way Mini-Mags worked before the replacement. You can use the original screw-on end with the new LED and it works fine.
1476733953|4.0|This one was over-hyped for me. Hugh Howley is a fine writer and Wool is a fine dystopian novel with a good balance of worldbuilding intrigue and urgency, but I didn't experience anything extraordinary like what the other readers are gushing about. Maybe it's Howley's rise from regular-guy-who-dreams-of-being-a-writer to bestselling award winner via self-publishing that propelled the Legend of Wool.<br /><br />I do intend to read the next two books of the series because I want to see how it all turns out. And I would love to see Wool: The Movie if it ever makes it to the big screen. There are plenty of dusty visuals here that would look fantastic in IMAX.

B008Y212PI|5.0|I've been playing it for over an hour straight. It's quiet, so it won't wake my toddler. It's a little challenging, but not impossible. And, since it was free as the app of the day... DEFINITELY worth what I paid. It would actually be a game I'd consider paying for, which is saying something.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it is so much fun and looks so real it feels like I have a horse of my very own
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Just like Stargate SG-1, Atlantis is very good also. You gotta love sci-fi though, or this will make you change the channel. The plot lines and dialogue are expertly written. Not too often do they introduce a theory or idea that doesn't make some sense. You won't feel stupid watching the show. The various premises for the show are intelligently presented. Nothing worse than the dialogue, plot points, and ideas that make no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />It does help to have some Stargate SG-1 knowledge under your belt to get you up to speed on the Wraith-filled stories.  Give it a try.
B000SVZIR6|5.0|I rented this AGAIN to compare with a stage musical I had just seen to see how true it was to this movie.  I like the ending of this movie better than the musical...King dies.  I am a romantic and wanted all to click at the end!
B00000JPH6|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  May be a little intense in parts for small children.  Muppets, mupets and more muppets, entertaining for adults.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This show is fantastic. Sierra Boggess has an awesome voice. I went to the original Phantom of the opera in Toronto and this is just as good. Ramin Karimloo did a great job as the Phantom, but nobody can sing the Phantom as Colm Wilkens. I play this all the time.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|I love this movie.  Good fantasy story.  Entertaining for adults and children.  Some parts may be too intense for small children.
B006GHA9VQ|1.0|I thought part 2, great. I love Phantom of the opera, so i thought this would be great and I even read the reviews on how good it was. This movie was a complete let down. The only good thing about it is that it explains what happens after Phantom of the opera. Some of the sets looked cheap as if it was slapped together just to make a part 2 movie and the music was not very good. One scene in the show was freaky to put it nicely. Some people might like this very much, but for me i hated it.
B0000714BP|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  Patrick Swayzy in heels!!  Wesley Snipes in a dress!!  John Leguizano in a mini skirt!!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I can't put it down.  Can't wait to see what happens next.  Very well written.  Typical Stephen King subject matter.
1415930066|5.0|CD's arrived in a timely fashion with packaging intact. Some very minor damage on some of the disks but I have received tips on how to clean them up and they seem to be working fine. These were a great deal and I'm very pleased with the product thus far.
1476727651|5.0|I really wanted to start this review of \\"Dr. Sleep\\" without mentioning its predecessor; however, I'm starting to realize that's downright impossible, so why fight it?  \\"The Shining\\" is, in my humble opinion, the best horror novel ever written by an American.  The characters are relatable, the pacing pitch perfect, the scares still scary after numerous re-reads, etc.<br /><br />So it's both surprising and not-so-surprising that, thirty-six years later, King would write the sequel in question, \\"Dr. Sleep.\\" Surprising because \\"The Shining\\" is really in no need of a sequel, as anyone who has read that book can tell you.  Things end pretty nicely; it's not wrapped up in a neat little bow, but it's honestly possibly the best ending King ever wrote.  Not surprising because, as a fictionalized Matt Damon points out in Kevin Smith's \\"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,\\" \\"Sometimes you go back to the well.\\"<br /><br />Before we get to the good/bad of this book, let's take a look at the plot.  Little Danny Torrance is all grown up.  Now answering to Dan, he has unfortunately turned into a royal screw-up and alcoholic, just like his old man.  Dan Torrance drifts around the eastern United States, keeping as far away from the Rockies as he can while drowning both the traumatic events of his childhood and his unique telepathic gift in a flood of cheap whiskey and barroom brawls.  After hitting rock-bottom in a Wilmington, North Carolina apartment, he winds up in Frazier, New Hampshire, a tourist-trap town in the White Mountains where he befriends a few locals and gets himself into AA.  He also lands a job with a local hospice where he, along with the help of a true story-inspired prescient cat, Azreel, aids the more seriously ill patients during the final countdown.  Dubbed \\"Dr. Sleep,\\" he has just about turned his life around totally when he befriends a young girl named Abra Stone.<br /><br />At only thirteen, Abra (yes, as in \\"cadabra\\") has the shining too, but is already stronger than Dan ever was.  Cause for celebration, to be sure, except Abra's gift has attracted the attention of some very scary non-people.  The True Knot is a Manson Family-esque gang of murderous supernatural gypsies who travel the country in a variety of RVs and motorhomes, feeding off the essence of children who have the shining.  Led by the beautiful, psychotic Rose the Hat and her Shakespeare-quoting lover Crow Daddy, the True Knot are essentially psychic vampires who were once all-powerful, but their numbers are dwindling.  Believing that feeding on Abra will restore them to their once near-invincible strength, the True Knot targets our young heroine and it is up to Dan to help her in the fight against them.<br /><br />First of all, let's talk about what worked.  Short answer: a lot.  I loved meeting back up with Dan and finding out that he still hasn't really escaped the Overlook.  Some might find this depressing, I found it realistic in regards to anyone who has been through such a traumatic experience, especially at such a young age. Seeing Dan hit rock-bottom was truly heartbreaking, and the scene illustrating this end to the downward spiral is possibly among the best King has ever written. I also loved the sprawling story it told; whereas \\"The Shining\\" is an exercise in claustrophobic horror, \\"Dr. Sleep\\" ping-pongs across the country and actually becomes somewhat of a road-trip story for part of the second act and nearly all of the third.  Abra Stone is probably the most realistic child character King has written since first creating Danny; while some of his more recent kid characters--such as Joe McClatchey and Norry Calvert in \\"Under the Dome\\"--seem one-dimensional and overly-precocious, Abra is a tough, crafty little chick who does not annoy the reader or impede the narrative whatsoever.  In fact, under her girl-next-door charm beats the heart of a truly intimidating adversary for our villains, Rose and her tribe of immortals.<br /><br />Speaking of the TrueKnot, I honestly loved these guys.  While their actions are truly despicable, King does a great job of developing their lifestyle and dynamic, managing to make them even somewhat likable.  We don't sympathize with them really, but we at least understand why they do what they do.  They are also, for better or worse, a family, and care about each other as much as the novel's more morally straight characters.  Rose the Hat is deliciously evil without being over-the-top, and Crow Daddy is one smooth-talkin' no-nonsense devil.  Fans of Rob Zombie's movie \\"The Devil's Rejects\\" will get a kick out this bunch of beer-gutted and polyestered nomadic serial killers.<br /><br />As for what didn't work: a few things.  One of the bad things about releasing a sequel almost forty years after its predecessor is the writer's fear that the reader will not remember what happened in the first book.  Considering \\"The Shining\\"'s popularity, I'm honestly a little surprised King was afraid of this, but this authorial anxiety is definitely evident in \\"Dr. Sleep,\\" given the amount of times King references the Overlook Hotel, certain scenes from the first novel, etc.  They grow somewhat tiresome, but luckily there's enough new material to soften the blow of these \\"hey, remember whens?\\"  While the book kicks off to an exciting start and has a truly satisfying conclusion, it does bog down a bit in the middle as Dan works in the hospice while Abra figures out how to use her powers.  A few more nit-picky things that are by no means foreign to a King book: at times clunky dialogue, schmaltzy character interactions, occasionally repetitive plot points, etc.  Honestly though, this book's biggest flaw has nothing to do with quality, the story, or the characters: it's just not \\"The Shining.\\"<br /><br />Is this a new classic? No.  Is it as good as \\"The Shining\\"? No.  Is it the best thing King has ever written? Definitely not.  But, if you can get past your own nostalgia, you'll realize that there is still a great story being told here, the work of a master who, despite all the naysayers and cynics, is still firing on all cylinders.  Give this book a buy, and go on yet another adventure with Dan Torrance, the kid--now man--who shines on.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. It is SOOOOO awesome. It is totally worth your money. The computer edition is better though.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Simple game. Good time waster but has a few puzzles with glitches (I ran into 3 in the first 4 paintings).  Not a bad free app if the day.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this game you gotta buy it it rules it is so awesome<br />I play it nearly every day
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|this is a great game. I just wanted to tell people that in the game if u hag a kindle like me then u can't play the plane blowing game so u can just go to options and turn off the airplane so u. don't have to play that one. I think that is in the options place and its probably there for people who have cases on their phone so they don't want to use it so it shudder work for other devices like the kindle
B008Y212PI|5.0|This app is pretty fun! Great exercise for the mind.  The 5 squares by 5 squares were very easy and I quickly went to the 10 squares by 10 squares.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book & storyline.  I couldn't wait until I had time to finish reading this book...it totally captivated me.  Excellent all the way through.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|wonderful movie love the 3d effect it was really greatI love 3d movies I think you're great highly recommend this movie
B0089LOG02|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this tale of love, loss, and hope.  I couldn't put it down, and ended it with tears in my eyes (happy tears).
B008Y212PI|5.0|I've played other nonogram games from the appstore and I find this easy and finger friendly. It's nice that you can solve the same image in 3 dificulty levels, but I find that on the 5x5 level, the resulting solution is far from the look of the image.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game, love the daily free games and the colorful items to win!!! Love the blackout game /
B0054R6BFM|3.0|One of my favorite things about the book is the style in which it is written. Going through the story through the eyes of Clay gives it a unique perspective and really brought it to life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very we'll set up from the ground up. The whole entire series is amazing. Best book I've ever read in my whole life!
B008Y212PI|5.0|great way to learn this type of game. great for beginners<br />learn to do a new type of challenge. great for puzzle lover's. a must have for those that want to be challenged
0984999302|3.0|2013-11-19 Updated Review<br /><br />To readers who never finished this book, and potential buyers.....SERIOUSLY consider purchasing [[ASIN:0060891548 On Writing Well, 30th Anniversary Edition: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction]]<br /><br />Doing so, and reading at least up to page 21 of 323 pages, will improve your own note taking style and enable you to SAFELY cut out much of the \\"sentence padding\\" that Messieurs Blank & Dorf have forced upon readers.<br /><br />Reading for understanding takes time, and RICH people know that time is money. Don't waste yours on this book unless you 1st upgrade your personal editing skills.<br /><br />It is shame to make readers work so hard.<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />P.S.<br />As meeting with either Messieurs Blank or Dorf is unlikely, I hope when I am done editing I will get what I paid for.<br /><br />-----------------<br />It might be helpful to some readers to know that I am reading this E-BOOK concurrently with<br /><br />1.[[ASIN:1601630239 Financial Statements: A Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding and Creating Financial Reports]]<br /><br />and<br /><br />2. [[ASIN:1608322467 Seeing the Big Picture: Business Acumen to Build Your Credibility, Career, and Company]]<br /><br />As other readers have said, Mr. Blank's book is heavy on repetition & fancy phrases that I don't think are part of the finance industry...although it is a business book.<br /><br />It does contain some informative ideas which can open doors to sensible changes in the direction of your thinking.....and for this alone it is worth a read.<br /><br />You have to be determined to extract valuable content from this book, as such content does exist therein....however it is buried.<br /><br />What do I mean by buried?<br /><br />Well, much like prospecting for gold or looking for a nail in a haystack, you often will read Mr. Blank's presentation of an important idea....relevant because it connects to & corrects a misconception or bias of yours...and not recognize it as important although it is right there in-front of you.<br /><br />He doesn't do much highlighting.<br /><br />Kinda like the Mechanics teacher who won't change the tone of his voice when telling you how important water & coolant is to a mechanical engine in your USD $60,000 Foreign Car, after telling you how comfortable the seats are.<br /><br />Yes we know lights on the dashboard mean something, but did you know that YOUR car has 4 extra dashboard lights?<br /><br />Well Mr. Blank presents the dashboard, but you have to notice the 4 extra lights for what they mean to you.<br /><br />His book presents some interesting ideas....but what they mean to each reader is where the work starts. You have to figure that piece out, as his book helps to point out things you might want to change about your approach to starting a business.<br /><br />Start doing that and you start gaining from this book.<br /><br />Cheers.
B00936A0RU|5.0|This movie was great the first time & even better the second time. Love historical dramas, the costumes and the casting was spot on....
B002KS1IJC|5.0|wow.  great.  was not expecting it to be that good.  pleasantly surprised.  am a total sci-fi junky. a really good flick. don't know why this hasn't been advertised?
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I am a die hard fan of both &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns.&#34;  While, in my opinion, this novel does not live up to it's predecessors, it is still a great read.  Hosseini again gives an insightful look into the lives of Afghani people and refugees.  He also provides us with a new perspective - that of relief workers in Afghanistan.  My main critique is that there are too many plot lines.  Connection with the characters can become a bit muddy when there are so many story lines involved.  Overall, I would still recommend it, especially to fans of the first two books.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I really don't have many complains for this mouse. Ever since I got it it has worked perfectly for about one month now with out any problems and I hope it will continue to for a long time to come. The software that you can get for this mouse is fairly easy to use and it allows you to change basically all of the settings on the moust.
0307237699|5.0|I've read books by politicians before, even books by people who ended up as President, including JFK and LBJ. None of them were this good. I was surprised that the writing style was easy to follow, and that the ideas graspable while not simple. Further surprising was how often the author seemed to see both sides of each issue instead of just pushing an agenda.<br /><br />While it's not the same guy who is currently in office (I assume the office changes you), it is certainly the guy that the country voted for. It's worth a read even if you don't agree.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|When I got the knife I was surprised at how heavy it is. Love the size of the knife! The only thing that sucked was the factory edge couldn't  cut butter. I sharpened knife then batoned some wood with it and it didn't even jack up the edge. I would recommend chopping up people with this knife. Dexter should have had this knife on his show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. Love the occasional change of location. Stops the game getting stale. Definitely worth a download, you won't regret it
B002Z58GQI|5.0|I buy it for the storage of some important file. and does not use it very often. It works well, worthing the price.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was well written and very engaging.  Would highly  encourage anyone who enjoys well developed characters, history, and a good story to purchase this book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great way to kill time.  Exhausting trying to keep up with layers of thought put into the characters' motivations and justifications.  All in all well written and entertaining.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Very disapointed that it does not work on a kindle. I received the free app and as I was attempting to set the alarm I was very quickly prompted to \\"Upgrade\\".  I did, but the app did not work.
B00991TCOG|5.0|It's not often that you enjoy every title on an album. Guess what's coming now? Yes on this album I liked all of them. In fact, I couldn't stop playing it. Lindsey is a brilliant violinist and her personality just makes you love her. The pieces on the album are all composed by her and she has succeeded in bringing the violin to life. I can't wait for her next album.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is a Time killer so addicting !! Mustt try this game!! Fun snd callenging. It really gives my brain a nuce workout.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Typical DeMille. Could not put this down. Love the characters, and especially Det. Corey's sense of humor. I would actually love to hear this book - but I bought the Kindle version.  A good buy!
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This game is so fun! I just got it when I first got it I thought I would be disappointed but I wasn't this game has wonderful graphics and is just like temple run with a twist!!<br />I recommend this game. No bugs. People say it freezes you devise it didn't for me.<br />It's addictive,fast-paced,and great for zombie lovers!!<br />****IF YOU DON'T LIKE GORE DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!****<br />I got this game earlier today and haven't stopped playing it.<br />I HIGHLY recommend this game for zombie lovers.<br />It's a game that gets my heart racing and I love  zombies it's a little confusing at first then you get it then it's super easy, don't uninstall it the first time you try and don't get it, keep trying!!!!!!!! It took me a few times to figure it out then it's natural for you to do!<br />GET THIS GAME ITS WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DURHYWC|2.0|I am a very big Pink Martini fan. I have all their albums and love every one of them- except this one. I usually like all their foreign renditions of songs but in Get Happy they all seem forced and rather irritating. I really wanted to like this album even when it downloaded in my Cloud Player. I thought maybe that's why I didn't like it at first. But when I listened to it in CD format I still loathed it. I recommend that if you love Pink Martini like I do, skip this album and buy the Retrospective album instead. It has all their greatest hits as well as reworked songs and some great new ones too. I listen to Retrospective and all their others like Sympathique, Hang on Little Tomato and Hey Eugene all the time. It's a shame the quality of their music has diminished because in their previous albums they are really fun to listen to.
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|It's most likely what you'd expect it to be, could have been better though, in my opinion ....... 3.5 stars.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have never played this type of puzzle before. I am definitely hooked. will definitely buy more of these apps
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|this is a pretty neat game. i dont play it very often but when i do i enjoy playing it
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book has amazing description and is full of action. I never wanted to put it down this is a must read for anyone from 10 to 110 years old
B008Y212PI|5.0|Got this yesterday and already almost done the whole game!! LOVE IT it so fun and i love puzzle games like this
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Unbelievably fun. And to those who think it's extremely harsh ( as it is, at a couple places), what do you expect, It's Steven King.<br />Actually, I find it interesting that there are those who don't get a book like this .To each their own.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played,,,great on my kindle a game every one should have,hard to put down fun for the entire family..
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Someone at work told me to watch this movie and I was very uninterested based on the cover and the description, however it was hilarious. Plus a good story, good characters, I liked the actors. Everytime I watch it it gets funnier.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love it because I can set it for my local town or any city I want. Switch it to maps and the radar is displayed, still or moving. It offers a lot more.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Rented this as the reviews for Red2 were good. Otherwise hadn't heard of this movie but it was great. Very funny. Good story.
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|The stargate series was the greatest. They should do follow up movies for those of us who can't get enough. I recommend this show to anyone who likes sci-fi and even those that don't!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Don't get showtime but have heard a lot about this show. From the very first episode I could not get enough of it. Great characters, intriguing story line. Each episode ends so you feel like you have to go right into the next. SO GOOD.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fastest way to play solitaire on the planet. I like how you only have to touch a card and it moves for you.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really like games that make you have to think, but are still fun --and do not make you feel stupid! This game fits that description very well! It 's fun, with just enough challenge. I even like the pictures and the sound effects. No complaints here!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Not a how to book, but rather a reporting of this one woman's experience. Interesting read. She answers the most common questions she's asked at the end.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|It's a good love story.  The acting is good and over all it is a good movie, but keep your Kleenex box handy.  PKDS
B00FEHXISA|4.0|What makes the Iron Man movies great is that it all \\"looks\\" so real and Exec Producer Jon Favreau (who directed the first two) keeps his hands on and does an excellent job making it all pretty believable as well. And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an \\"iron\\" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but can fly. There's a bit more cheese and silliness in Iron Man 3 than the first two, but it all still works well.<br /><br />Who better to be in the role of the eccentric, wise-guy Tony Stark than Robert Downey, Jr.? Man, does he nail the role of Stark or what?! The rest of the cast, especially villain Guy Pearce, was terrific. Pearce does a great comic book-esque bad guy. Don Cheadle (Iron Patriot) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) add some nice flavor to this installment, but I gotta say, the less I see of them in an iron suit in any subsequent films the better.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 picks up where [[ASIN:B0099RFVXQ Marvel's The Avengers]] left off and has Stark dealing with two issues: 1) Post traumatic stress disorder, and 2) A slighted scientist from his past. Oh, and a third issue is a terrorist called The Mandarin that ultimately twists beautifully into the film. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written and Shane Black in the director's chair keeps the viewer clamoring more of Marvel's series of Avengers related films over the next several years.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 may not be the best in the Iron Man or Marvel Superhero franchise, but it's still a great movie. Worthy of an on demand viewing at minimum.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|If you have seen sleeping with the enemy then you will love this movie. The concepts are the same and the Suspense was great for a Romance movie
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is quick and fun. The harder levels are a little but if a challenge if you are new to these types of games.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I love this movie, but as soon as my membership was paid for, the program is giving me problems. I really want to keep this membership, but if this is going to continue I am going to have to cancel my membership.
B006VJMZXY|3.0|Not a subject area I usually read but did so for a book discussion session.<br />Along with others in the group I had mixed reactions.<br />Best of these is that I really admire the Author's work in researching the background and then having the confidence to fill in the gaps and make some necessary conjectures.
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|My daughter has loved this group for ever. She was surprised to get it, she has listened to it several times. Will recommened this seller.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|A lot of fun.<br />The device of having the main character meet the major political leaders of the 20th century was a very good one, and entertaining.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is on track. I used to read every<br />one of his books as soon as they came out, but I stopped many years ago. I recently reread the Shining and loved it again. I'm glad I now know how Danny grew up.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Professor Layton games, so 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors was in my recommendations because of that. And I'm so, so glad it was! I ended up buying this great game, I literally could not put it down. It's pleasantly a bit more mature than I was expecting (I honestly didn't pay much attention to the specific warnings near the M for Mature sign). It has a lot of mystery, suspense, and action. There were so many parts in this game that hit you unexpectedly, it's almost like a movie. They're obviously a little different, but if you like the Professor Layton series, you'll like this more mature (and very graphic) mystery, puzzle, visual novel game. There are 6 different endings (so far I've unlocked 3 very interesting ones) you can get, and after the first time you play through, you can go back and play again with the ability to skip the text and dialogue! I thought that was a great feature, since reading the text through again would've been a pain if you're playing it 4 times over as I am (I say this because there is a lot of text, but it's very well written, engrossing, and sometimes even humorous). So, if you're looking for an action filled, suspense and mystery game (with graphic, almost cringe-worthy descriptions, maybe even gory at parts), this would definitely be one of the top choices.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought the first temple run was good but this one is so addictive. the only improvement would be to have different boards for the time of year like subway surfer has
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|My husband and I have already watched this movie three times in a twenty four hour span! We Love it and are SO proud to live in The Shoals!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Very deep subject matter.  This movie showed different layers of the treatment of slaves.  This was an important history lesson wrapped up in a story of enduring love.
B005723JSQ|2.0|Disappointed!  I know these are not meant to be serious novels and I have enjoyed her other books.  This however is downright silly and and not well thought out.  Please don't publish another like this.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I am at a loss for words to adequately describe the beautiful verses in Peter, Enchantment and Stardust.  To fully appreciate the work, one should read its predecessor, Peter, A Darkened Fairytale.  Then, you will have full understanding of this collection.  To quote W.H. Auden, \\"A poet is, before anything else, a person who is passionately in love with language.\\"  This describes Mr. O'Brien...a true poet and a lover of language.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Not particularly hard but quite addictive. Helps to pass a bit of time.  Was free app of the day but glad i downloaded it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addicting. I wish there were more levels because I can't seem to put this game down. Absolutely love this game.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This works really well for Netflix and Youtube, but streaming from a browser has a little too much lag.  I love the option to stream from the browser, but it's pretty hard to watch when the mouths and audio are about 1 sec off.  It works with Netflix, Youtube, Google Play, and the browser.  I wish it worked with Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus too.  Hopefully, that comes in the future.<br /><br />Another big drawback is that I feel I was tricked into thinking it didn't need external power.  Notice how all the pictures of the Chromecast have a little port on the end?  That's where you plug in the power cord.  Not one single photo I saw had the cord showing.  You can plug it into the wall or a USB port, but it makes it a lot more cumbersome than originally advertised.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this yet.  It seems to me that the Roku Stick has more options for streaming and doesn't need an external power source.  Although the Roku is $100 and the Chromecast is $35, I don't think the Chromecast compares yet.  Maybe when they support Amazon and Hulu.
030758836X|4.0|A mystery that is more character study than whodunit, Gone Girl is clever, with nicely textured prose and twists that sometimes surprise.  Several of the twists including the big one -- won't give that away -- are not that difficult to guess.  And there was a bit of redundancy in some of the narrative, as in the book could have used more aggressive editing.  (I'd say 10-20% could be trimmed, which is not bad.)  Then, the ending is pretty unsatisfying as others have said.  It's as though the author felt obliged to give us an unexpected end to the story, and so she gave us one that strains credulity a bit.  Nick goes from lout to devoted a little too easily.<br /><br />That said though, it's a compelling read -- I would recommend it.  It's a book you can't put down without learning how the story plays out.  Makes the reader think about how much we mask ourselves when embarking on the most important relationship we will have, that with our spouse.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Loved this book and the previous book.  Found it interesting, characters well developed and at times could not put the book down.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I like this game. It's challenging - makes you think. A fun way to pass the time with logical moves and steps.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you loooooove horses or if you've ever wanted one this app is for you! I LOOOOOVE this app!!! :)
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I listen to this album constantly. The production value is what I really seem to enjoy about this record, because it just seems that the guitars on this album are so much beefier and hold a clearer tone than the recorded guitars from their &#34;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&#34; album. Don't get me wrong, their Dinosaurs album is fantastic, but &#34;Black Gives Way To Blue&#34; just has a lot more of the heavy guitars that I loved about Alice in Chains during the early and mid 90s. Definitely get this album if you enjoy any of Alice in Chains' older albums, like their best: &#34;Dirt.&#34; Oh, and you might as well just purchase &#34;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&#34; while you're at it, since the song &#34;Hollow&#34; sounds like it was lifted straight from an early 90s Alice in Chains recording session. ;)
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Good saga, can't wait to read the rest of it. Got to know how all these characters end up and who becomes the King of Thrones.
B001NHNG64|5.0|If you like Jack Reacher you're going to love this installment. Starts off fast and doesn't slow down. Just when I think Lee Child has told every story of Jack Reacher he surprises me again. fun
B008Y212PI|4.0|I have wondered if this type of game would be difficult to play so when I saw this was the Free App of the day and decided to install it and have been enjoying it ever since !

B001RTSPVY|5.0|What can I say to add to the accolades for Breaking Bad. we ordered the second season long before we had completely watched Season 1. It was so good that we could not have a break in between them. Couldn't wait for it to come. This was better than even the first season, and now of course when the last season has ended, everyone knows it is a great show...love it love it love it.

161775188X|5.0|Simon's Cat began as a series of YouTube videos and quickly turned popular for their hilariousness and how accurate the depictions were of how cat's truly are. The first Simon's Cat video was uploaded over 5 years ago, on March 4, 2008. It's one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />While the books aren't nearly as hilarious as the videos, they are still entertaining and fun to flip through for a good laugh. Simon's Cat vs. the World are single page illustrations detailing various encounters from visits to the Vet, holiday outfits, discovering the vividness of HD TV and even fireworks.<br /><br />In addition to that, there was also a short section in the back that details how to draw a few of the animals that feature in his books.<br /><br />And my favorite part? A whole page of adorable stickers.<br /><br />The best thing about these books is just how realistically the illustrations showcase the shenanigans of cats and what cat owner's constantly have to deal with. Simon's Cat is highly amusing and a source of good quick fun. Recommended for any cat lover and anyone who just enjoys a good laugh.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really do recommend this for people who need alarms ...it really works and you can program it for an alarm ringtone or a personal ringtone...

1609611543|5.0|'Wheat Belly' is really a must read for all.  Although quite technical at times, the book is very readable ... and it is certainly worth reading.  The author seems quite knowledgeable about all the nasty properties of wheat, especially the modern varieties of wheat that causes so many people grief.  Clearly if one is overweight/obese, has chronic health issues, or simply wants to be healthier this book can convince you (read: anyone!) to eliminate wheat from one's diet.  The author's arguments are quite compelling.<br /><br />Bottom line: strongly recommended for all!

The tutorial was very helpful in getting me started. Now I can't stop playing. I love setting my own pace and not playing against the clock. It's a very relaxing game.  I'll definitly download more of these games.  Happy puzzling !
B00F2LIV4E|4.0|From the first track (False Awakening Suite), the mood of this album is set as heavy and theatrical. In fact, this first track could have been plucked from a movie or video game. The music is at times menacing or even scary while at other moments playful if not a little heavy handed. That is where the album falls a little flat. It isn't that this is a bad album, there is great musicianship, and every song oozes of Dream Theater sounds, but what this album lacks is Dream Theater creativity. It is as if they were so focused on making the definitive Dream Theater sound, they forgot to make some definitive songs.<br /><br />Some have compared this cd to Images and Words, but, while I can see some similarity in mood, these songs seem less refined in many ways. There is no doubt that DT knows how to play, but these songs seem more like a collection of riffs sewn together without the heart that was not only on the cover of Images and Words, but very present in the songs as well.<br /><br />Sound wise, I love the fidelity of this album. I have heard complaints about the drum mix, but if you are a fan of the sound of Rush's Moving Pictures album, you should love the sound here. Fat, layered, and tons of headroom make this the best sounding DT album for me. It is just a shame that the songs off of this cd are not as memorable as those from Moving Pictures. Again, there is nothing wrong with the the songs, but when cast into the ocean of the Dream Theater collective, I dare say nothing will stand out.<br /><br />DT's musicianship is fantastic as always. Mangini Sounds fine, Petrucci's guitar sounds awesome, Myung is great, Rudess is typical, and Labrie found his voice again (for the most part). The songs run the gambit from heavy to calming and beautiful. It is all here. Everything you would expect to hear from Dream Theater is here--and well done. Just not, unfortunately, very memorable.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|No wasted space. Solid advice throughout. Anyone who'd like to utilize their creativity more effectively, read this. Especially if you don't think you're creative.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I can't quite figure out how this book got so many 5 star reviews - it is really not well written and not very sophisticated. I quite enjoyed the storyline, and read it until the end, but just couldn't get past the fact that the writing was a bit too simplistic. All-in-all: it was ok, but not worth all the 5 star reviews!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|And The Mountains Echoed is the third book by acclaimed author Khaled Hosseini, whose previous two books `The Kite Runner' and `The Thousand Splendid Suns' are bestsellers.<br /><br />`You want a story and I will tell you one,' -  The story begins in Afaganistan 1952, where Saboor is travaling with his son Abdullah and his daughter `Pari' to Kabul through the MOUNTAINS.<br /><br />Saboor tells them a story, a story to prepare Pari and Abdullah, specially Abdullah who has unusually powerful bond to his sister `Pari'. Saboor narrates them a story which has a simple moral - `how at times of need, one has to sacrifice a finger to save a hand'. A mythical story of a div (or demon) and a father who will give away his most loved son to demon for a better life on a pact that he will never see him again. Saboor is telling this story to his son to prepare him for the coming disaster which will changes the lives of everyone, the one that will ECHO down the generations.<br /><br />The book compared to other Hosseini's book doesn't have single or two character narrative instead this book has the multi-layered narrative in which the different characters linked to same family in different timelines narrates the story.<br /><br />There are only few writers who can produce back-to-back masterpieces and Husseini is one of those writers.There is lot to learn in this book, Love, Friendship, political turmoil in Afghanistan. The portrayal of each character in this book excellent, you will feel the pain, sadness and happiness of each character in this book. Each character and each story in this book is crafted perfectly and the stories in this book though at beginning you won't find any relevance  to actual story but at the end all threads will meet perfectly to make a perfect story.<br /><br />As I proceeded with the story, I realized that each character in this book is a hero, either it be Parawana step mother of Abdullah or Nabi uncle of Adbullah or Nila Wahdati - each and every character has a story to tell and each story will make that character a hero. Each character has a purpose in this book though a purpose he/she never had in her mind.<br /><br />At times I felt that narrative was disjointed and doesn't have a clear picture as to their relation to the story of Abdullah and Pari. Like the narrative of Markos - a Greek aid worker in Afghanistan and acquaintance of Nabi.<br /><br />But nevertheless - And The Mountains Echoed is an epic tale of heartbreak and hope, hope of meeting your loved ones, hope of reuniting with your family. And Indeed \\"This story is like a moving train: no matter where you hop on-board, you are bound to reach your destination sooner or later.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book for everyone. Go ahead and read it.cter has a story to tell and each story will make that character a hero.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Could not put this book down.  The Shining has always been one of my favorite King books and Doctor Sleep brings the story of Dan Torrance full circle.<br />Like the Shining, this is a creepy story. It will keep you up at night.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Well done book that tells the the true story of what happened to a young white woman sent to jail for a crime committed many years before.  It was a good read and an enlightening entry into a life most people have no access to, or ignore because it is something so far removed from their reality.  I have a much better understanding of how we should change our prison system to one that actually supports sustainable change for the women who are inside.  The book makes you realize that 'but for the grace of god, there go i'.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I have this app on my Fire and Android phone. It has been super useful in determining what channel to set my router to. I find few routers properly change channels themselves. I use this app to move around my house to view other wifi signals and determine which one I should use to avoid interference. I then lock my router to that signal.<br /><br />I wish this app was available on my Windows phone too. I'd be set on all my devices then.
1400069807|4.0|This book was so interesting because while it read like a novel, it had so many facts. Many historical, timeline facts. He really explained how we got to where we are, not just the normal, how bad this stuff is for you. Excellent read!
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|I give it 5 stars because there is not more on the Amazon rating system...I love it!...This CD is a must if you love great dance and pop music, Cher outdid herself with this selection of songs .....If you love Cher you will love this CD!

B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|For starters, I am a guy and I love all forms of music (and I mean all forms). Some days Ill pop on some Elton John, other days Im in an Earth Wind & Fire kind of mood. If I feel like just sitting back to relax Country it is from Garth Brooks, George Strait, to Tim Mcgraw. The production of music is also a favorite of mine Daft Punk's latest release still gets played. That being said here is my review for 20/20 Experience Part 2.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake should get an award for releasing 2 full length albums in one year. I have no idea how he convinced the label to allow this but ITS AWESOME (most would make a deluxe edition and then a platinum edition just to milk it). I will side with another review I read that in comparison to Part 1 this album does not have that flow to it. It feels more like singles taken and tossed onto a CD. While Part 1 Pusher Love Girl flows into Suit & Tie. Only 1 or 2 tracks possess that on this album ex. Cabaret- TKO, You Got it ON-Amnesia. Usually I try not to write reviews this early but this album is just that excellent.<br /><br />Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)- Tecno Pop beat lyrics flow with the beat<br /><br />True Blood-bass driven beat lyrics describe sex in a vampiric nature think Thriller meets Tunnel Vision<br /><br />Cabaret- Solid I want you now type track, but while I like Drake he should not have been featured on this track, should have been JT solo<br /><br />TKO-nice beat, lyrics of a womans love knocking you out lol<br /><br />Murder- awesome single, great beat very mainstream, Jay-Z unlike Suit & Tie, he should not have been featured on this track<br /><br />Take Back the Night- definite reminicent of MJ's Off the Wall, has that poppin I just want to get up and walk the block saying Hi to everyone I know while dancing of course.<br /><br />Drink You Away- perfect blend of instrument use, solid lyrics<br /><br />You Got It On- reminds me of old Ginuwine, Marvin Gaye, Isley Brothers shoot even old R.Kelly (non freaky songs) great melody and lyrics<br /><br />Amnesia- great song of love, perfect instrument and beat use. Love it<br /><br />Only When I Walk Away- I keep skipping over to listen to Not a Bad Thing<br /><br />Not A Bad Thing- nice acoustic guitar I believe with the use of Timberlands beats gives it a very poppy flavor, Love this song when I renew my vows this is going to be my wedding song for real.<br /><br />If this CD would have dropped first it would have done great probably selling the same amount. It is a great product, great singles, not a flow from track to track like Part 1 or FutureSex/LoveSounds. But it didnt Part 1 set a standard I dont think JT can repeat with a follow-up album this soon. But if he continues to drop albums every 6-7 years Ill take 20 tracks because up until The 20/20 Experience I was still listening to FutureSex/LoveSounds on the regular.<br /><br />Overall- If you did not like Part 1 you might like Part 2 it is a completely different album. If you liked Part 1, Part 2 might be too much of a different direction for you. Imagine Prince's The B Sides, similar structure but completely different product.<br /><br />***Update**** 10/16/13<br /><br />Having taken more time to immerse myself into the album I would like to make edits to the following tracks: Cabaret,Only When I Walk Away, and Murder<br /><br />Cabaret: Drake's verse is actually well placed, it grew on me, not I wished he had did more of his sing-rap style but still a solid addition to the track<br /><br />Murder: Jay-Z doesnt belong on this track with the tempo and beat. Like Suit & Tie I feel like the beat should have transformed for his verse<br /><br />Only When I Walk Away: Perfect song for those experiencing some issues in their relationship.

B00B0U2SFE|5.0|It was nice to watch the movie after 20 years, it's almost like you are watching it for the first time, you forget so many things.
B002GYI9C4|2.0|I'm surprised to see so many 4 and 5 star reviews of this book. I just don't see it. This book was very long, had zero characterization, and had a very cliched plot.<br /><br />The magic system I heard so much about, I'll admit, was a new take, but not that new, and not that interesting, especially with all tedious descriptions of it.  He burned this to do that, he burned this other thing to do that, burned such and such to do yet this other thing. The pacing of the actions scenes was very slow for me, choppy and boring. Every sword thrust or punch was described in minute detail. Which brings me to one of my biggest annoyances with this book, the bad guys were too easy to kill. All our bad guys, even the supposedly highly skilled ones, are like butter for our hero, and they only attack one at a time. Even when we are TOLD they attack all at once, from the minute blow-by-blow descriptions its obvious they attack one by one. Our hero only (sometimes) received the most minor of wounds. I never once felt any suspence or concern for him, because he was NEVER going to even COME CLOSE to losing. I found myself reading an adolescent comic book stytle cardboard cut out of superheroes, where the hero always wins by a mile.<br /><br />And our Heroine Vin, desribed as so skilled and streetsmart and powerful, and yet she constantly needs to be saved by our hero, makes sutupid decisions, has absoltely NO CLUE what is going on, continually thinks and states the obvious, and swoons over clothes and perfumes and shoes and cute boys. She's a surviver of terrible abuse, has suffered injuries to all levels, and its up to our hero to heal her! Please. Where have I come across this character a hundred times? Everywhere, and written ten times better.<br /><br />The plot was - simple. Very simple. To the point that the bad guys had to seem like blind idiots to not know what was going on. They had to be dumbed down so much to make our good guys get anywhere close to seeming smart and skilled. See example above of the masses of bad guys so easily dispatched by our hero in battle, and you'll have an idea how the entire plot goes. It reads more like a comic book for children than an adult level epic fantasy. There is no depth to Mistborn, not in characters or in plot.<br /><br />I've heard such great things of Sanderson, what an excellent writer he is, but I just didn't see it. I thought his writing was tedious, overly description (not in a good way), overloaded with unnecessary adjectives and bogged down in tedious play by play actions scenes. The dialogue was stilted, boring, all the same no matter the character. Noone sounded like a real person. I can see why he was chosen to finish the Wheel of Time series, as I disliked that series for much of the same reasons as this one. I've read George R.R. Martin, Tad Williams, C.S. Friedman, Melanie Rawn, C.J. Cherryh, and many more excellent writers of excellent epic fantasies, and Mistborn can't even begin to compare. Not even close. Mistborn is a juvinille superhero comicbook power trip. I could see my 12 year old nieces and nephews liking it. Maybe. They liked Harry Potter an awful lot and Harry Potter is much better than Mistborn. I can see many people love this book and this series, and I anticipate there will be many more, but I for one will not be purchasing the rest of the series.<br /><br />If you like the Wheel of Time series, you might like this one. If you disliked Wheel of Time because of writing style and simplistic characters/plot, you might not like Mistborn.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I loved it!!  Megan is an abused wife coming to visit her brother.  Unfortunately, he has had an accident and she gets there in time for his funeral.  She meets her next door neighbors and meets the love of her life.  Very emotional book!!

B00C7607BC|5.0|Love, love, LOVE The Little Mermaid so of course I jumped at the chance to review The Little Mermaid Diamond Edition! The Little Mermaid holds a special place in my heart for two reasons.<br />This came out when I was a teenager so it reminds me of my youth and childhood. A little girl I babysat loved to watch it over and over again so I had it memorized as a teenager!<br />My four year old daughter Paige is OBSESSED with The Little Mermaid so it connects my childhood and hers! And when I say obsessed, I don't use that term lightly!<br /><br />Paige's room is decorated as Ariel. Her lunchbox, backpack, clothing, jewelry, toys; all Ariel. Every single Friday for share day at school she brings a different Ariel. Her birthday party was Ariel. The first ride we always go on at California Adventure - Ariel! When we went and saw Second Screen Live to test out the App she knew all the songs and trivia. You get the picture - obsessed!<br /><br />So as soon as this arrived she insisted on watching it because we haven't seen THIS Little Mermaid before! I tried to explain it was the same but thankfully, this edition does include some things that weren't included in the original. Thank you bonus features! She loved the new music video and could watch it all day.<br /><br />This is actually my third version of The Little Mermaid because Paige keeps watching them to the point of destruction! This is the first time we have seen on Blu-Ray so it makes the experience even more magical (if possible).  The Little Mermaid Diamond Edition is a must have for all you Ariel fans out there!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Love all the movies an videos. I love to craft and now I can get so much free information in one place
B009LDD54K|3.0|I loved the first two seasons of Boardwalk Empire.  Absolutely loved every episode.<br /><br />I found Season 3 to be extremely slow and boring.  For example, a very large percentage of time was spent on Margaret starting a women's health clinic.  Really?  Boardwalk Empire?<br /><br />I felt like I was sleepwalking through the whole season.  Something would happen, then everything would drift along for a while at a snail's pace, then we'd spend some time in one of Margaret's women's health care classes, then everything would drift along for a while.  All in s-l-o-w m-o-t-i-o-n.  There were a couple episodes where we watched Nucky listening to the phone ring (over and over and over again) because his latest mistress wasn't answering.  That's annoying in real life -- don't need more of it on tv!<br /><br />There were odd storylines that didn't really go anywhere, e.g., Teddy and the greenhouse fire and the &#34;gypsy man.&#34;<br /><br />Some of the gangster/bootlegging stuff was pretty good (Gyp Rosetti was definitely a raging maniac), but a lot of it was predictable...and slow.<br /><br />I found myself looking forward to the Agent Van Alden/George Mueller sequences and the Richard Harrow sequences.  They were the most fun in Season 3.<br /><br />I hope Season 4 picks up the pace.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Here is an app I would recommend. It has worked for me very well. In fact I used it yesterday .  I'm glad I have it on my kindle and computer.
B000FBJHBC|5.0|The best book since Band of Brothers. Every male should read this book, because male friendship is a lost art to the degree that the word &#34;bromance&#34; an expression that I hate, had gained acceptance
B008Y212PI|5.0|I didn't think I would like this game but I'm heading into my second day trying to do chores while balancing my kindle and doing puzzles.  Some of the puzzles are easy but many make you think before you tap as too many mistakes and you have to start over.  I like it!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|More Sigma Force please! Again James Rollins weaves a fascinating tale of science, history and human truths. A perfect blend of action, intellect and emotion. Can't wait for the next one.

B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Good game to pass time, very easy to play, but makes you think. Great fun to play, worth the $1,
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this series!  Watched episode after episode - just couldn't seem to stop!  Wonderful writing and acting, great story line
B001TH16DI|1.0|These discs don't play on my Samsung BD-P3600 Blu-Ray player, and since other people are having the same problem on other players I think the discs are the problem.
B004G606K8|4.0|I found the story long and engrossing, wonderful characters! I would recommend it for people who want a change for the Dungeons and Dragons games.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I enjoyed Vapor Trails but like many found the mix too loud and the distortion sometimes unbearable. I always thought it was a not so great mix but not awful. I was obviously mistaken. The original Vapor Trails mix is awful because at first listen to this remixed disc, I thought it was new material. It amazes me how much was lost under the puddle of mud that the original Vapor Trails is. The sound on this disc is fantastic. Every track sounds so clean and clear and I am hearing details that were totally lost on the original version. Even if you already own The original VT, this is a must have!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoy this game. It functions well. Some puzzles are challenging some are quite simple. I completed all the 5x5 puzzles in 1 night.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was a very nice read.  The storyline was unique and had a sifferwnt perspective then most books these days.  I would recommend it as a good story that would entertain when having time to kill (ie..planes, dr.s office etc)
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 is not enough levels at release. It is great fun for all.
B008Y212PI|5.0|An enjoyable game. I played right through all the beginning five grids in one sitting. I downloaded it when it was free, but would buy it too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an on the edge of your seat, gut and heart wrenching book! Another fantastically written book in the Hunger Games series! Almost better than the first, but in a different sense. The twists and turns keep you guessing!
B0092MKFIY|2.0|Radioactive is the only good song I latched onto and truly seem to have enjoyed off this album.<br /><br />Like everyone else (speaking as a mixing technician and audiophile), the overdrive, distortion, and clipping of the audio simply destroys the value of this album. If you want to crank it up and just jam to these songs, its impossible.
8862931921|2.0|I have been doing art journaling for about a year now and I bought this one to do my drawings in. I have heard so many good things about getting a Moleskine and how great they are and I am not happy with the paper. It tears and if you push to hard with your pencil it will leave indents on the next page.. I love that it has no spine in the way but other company's have that as well. I will be looking else where for my journal notebooks..
B008RA3X5E|5.0|works great and alarm allows use of music from device or cloud. great app for the price, even has snooze.
0307730697|5.0|Wow what a moving and tragic story about an incredible Navy SEAL and human being. I'd like to think I'm bulletproof but I cried like a little girl. Could not praise this book high enough. Not a typical &#34;SEAL book&#34;, its about hitting rock bottom and, through faith and family, rising back up to become the ultimate achiever and never giving up despite countless setbacks. Adam Brown was a man's man and somebody who I'd want to be like.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Seriously? This was an insult to F. Scott Fitzgerald. Jay-Z's music throughout the entire film? Atrocious. This story was glorious and this element completely smashed it to pieces. Almost as horrid as Leonardo De Caprio's modern interpretation of Romeo and Juliet in the 90s.  The music from the 20s was good enough. Modern rap crap ruined it.
038533348X|4.0|I would never call Vonnegut a great writer, as many have. His prose, while far superior to pop fiction, falls well short of \\"serious literature.\\" But I don't read Vonnegut to stimulate my mind; I read him to stimulate my funny bone. And the only other fiction writers who've done that so well are George Saunders and Philip Roth. I laughed dozens of times reading this book, and that alone is good for 4 stars. Humor is so subjective, though, that if you don't think he's funny, you won't like his books.<br /><br />The plot is imaginative, if a little silly. (The last quarter of the book actually got a little too silly for me.) And the characters are very fun, even though they don't have a lot of depth, in an \\"English class\\" sort of way. But this is comedic writing, so the rules are different. I don't expect the kind of gravitas from satire that I do from, say, 19th century Russian literature.<br /><br />My favorite things about the book are the quirky dialogue and the hilarious invented religion called Bokononism. My major complaint is that the plot got a little stupid at the end.<br /><br />There are times when this novel feels collegiate. (And Vonnegut WAS my favorite author at age 20.) I'm revisiting several of his books 25 years later. Still enjoyable but a little light.
0425263924|2.0|I bought a new book and they sent me one with the cover mistreated, as if it was used. It disappointed me, thought I didn't sent it back for the cost it will imply to me. not Happy with it.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|good game but you will be paying money if you really want to go through the whole game and its price is way too much one gem deal is 99 dollars CRAZY
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I have followed A Game of Thrones through the television series. Where usually anything televised will differ greatly from what was written, the series sticks closely to the book. The few episodes I missed I was able to catch up on and now I'm ahead of the series and can't wait to see how it actually plays out.<br />This is a very, very long read. But it was thoroughly enjoyable.
0439023521|1.0|This book was without a doubt the lousiest excuse for children's literature I have read in quite a while. I would give it a zero if I could. It's reminiscent of a very lame attempt at a Harry Potter-like story, only with an American Gladiator reality TV show thrown in. It's predictable, lacks a climax, and overall a waste of 6 hours to read. Save a tree, don't buy this book.  It might encourage her to write even more chapters. I read it only because my 11 year old is reading it in school, and I wanted to read it first. What a poor choice for that teacher. With all of the wonderful options for kids 11-12 out there, why in the world would she choose this?!? Astoundingly ignorant.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Employ some thinking skills and also a<br />Great way to pass some time.  Give it a try and you'll see why I like it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Anyone who likes a feel good story. I was crying and laughing by the end. Kids are amazing and resilient.

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|The levels are fun. They are not to easy or to hard. They give you just enough challenge to keep you entertained.
B004T4KKSA|4.0|Almost too much detail but a good read. If you skip around it is worthwhile. Great rundown of the 1973 oil embargo and the effect of the Iran crisis in 1979.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was a good book, but the author's voice was apparent in almost every one of the fictional \\"interviews\\". I would recommend this to anyone wishing for some light, fictional reading.
B001NB4Z6K|4.0|this is a great compilation of the bands beginning hits and is one for old '80's fans to have in their library.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|I waited for this set for decades.  Smiley Smile is a great album, and it's great to hear the finished version. I've heard alot of this album on the radio and was really excited when they finally completed it. Smiley Smile must have been a way for Capitol (or Brother) to pay for the hours of studio sessions were required for the incomplete version.  Some of the Smiley versions are better, in my opinion.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|The story is well written and the illustrations are beautiful. This is an awesome graphic novel for adults. If you love fantasy comic books this one is a treat!

B004RKXN44|5.0|I love Nalini Singh. She is a very creative author and keeps you guessing at every turn. I collect all her books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love minions, then you'll absolutely love this game. The graphics are amazing, the structure...heck who needs another reason other then, there's minions!!<br />One thing that I love about this game, is the programmers have made a way to earn the 2 types of currency; bananas and tokens, other then just buying them. It's like the good old times where you earn credits based on levels and/or challenges you beat. Of course there is the option of buying bananas or tokens, but it's not the only one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible because I love reading god's word. god is so good and I need him and his word in my life.
B008Y212PI|3.0|The game is really easy, and if you like easy puzzles, then this is the game you want. If you want something challenging though, look somewhere else.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I had never bought or played these type of games before. Now I am totally hooked. Love it. Can't wait to play more.
B0051UH6W4|2.0|I have no idea how this book managed to win awards. I enjoy prose and poetic descriptions but this was overkill. I felt I was drowning in a marsh of prose and the effort of trying to decipher the story was just too much. I'm not sure the author was on the same planet as the majority of the population and mostly the story and attempts at prose were disjointed and made very little sense. At one stage it took me a long time to work out what was being personified and given life - it turned out to be a cement rubbish bin shaped like a kangaroo. Odd phrases were repeatedly being used, \\"Love-in-Tokyo\\", \\"Not old, not young\\" and \\"Two-egg twins\\" are a few examples. I never really got to know the characters and the story never really came together for me. The moving forward and back in time just added to the confusion. I persevered in the hope that I might get into the story but I began to almost dread having to pick up this book. The last quarter became more readable but the first three quarters could have been condensed into a few chapters. There was an unpleasant scene early on in the book that in my opinion did not contribute in any way to the story so I'm not sure what it's function was. The last chapter was a descriptive love scene that was very out of place as one of the lovers was a very minor character in the story so this was a peculiar way to end this book. The author should either stick to story or prose but don't try to combine the two. I regret having wasted time reading this book when I could have read something more worthwhile.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the first and foremost the best game I would ever choose to download  and it's free so if I were you I would download this game right know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000FC1AGG|5.0|I loved this book! It was top notch, hilarious, and pretty realistic in the things that happened.  I loved that it was not that insta-love, can't-resist silliness, because that made it more believable, interesting, and gave more depth to the story.  It was a total crack up on the most of the pages, and I was continuously being asked what was so funny by people around me.  Great story too with good characters that actually learned and grew, I was so proud of them!  Great editing with no mistakes (which always distract me from the story) so it was a pleasure and delight to read on all fronts.  Read it!!! You won't be sorry :)
B000006UD8|5.0|I was in high school when this record came out and still listen to it today...for me it's what I call desert island must have music...right up there with The Allman Brothers Live At Fillmore East...the remix has breathed new life into the cd version. Having had the record I was always disappointed with the original cd release of this album...it just didn't have the sonic boom that the vinyl record did...but this remix changes that. It now soars out of speakers...if I have to have a complaint it's a small one...I don't like the alternate solo Roger mixed into Smoke On The Water...for me it doesn't have the same impact...but fear not you get the original version with this package as well...this is one of those classic rock albums that should find a home in every collection...this cd really rocks hard until it &#34;Smokes&#34; and not just &#34;On The Water&#34;...
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|Love how it's all based on the history of vikings, the way they see everything and lived. Can't wait for season 2 to begin.
B003Y8YXEO|5.0|I bought this cd to include &#34;Happy Xmas (War Is Over) into my collection. I grew up with The Beatles and followed John's solo career up until his untimely death...(I was watching Monday Night Football in a CT bar called Cafe 66 when we heard the news of his death...the bar crowd fell silent...we were stunned...). The remix of all these songs are very good and you won't be disappointed with this cd...the remix of the &#34;Imagine&#34; cd is also 5 stars...both of these are well worth your listening time as well as your hard earned $$$$$...
B000OLGCI4|5.0|One of my all-time favorite Disney movies. awesome 2 disc set. a lot of deleted footage and awesome games for the kids to play. 5 stars.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love puzzle games and these days it can be hard to find a good puzzle game which is why I am super excited about this game. It's fun easy and very addicting.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|I just got this unit tonight and have been playing with it until the wee hours. I cannot recommend this puppy enough. I made the switch from a Line 6 TonePort UX1 (I know, I know) and the difference is as clear as night and day.<br /><br />I've thrown everything at it: vocals, guitar and MIDI and it handles everything with gusto. I'm especially enamored with the ASIO driver, as the TonePort's sucked and ASIO4All wasn't performing as well as I hoped it would. I've got my buffer set to 6ms and my latency is 15.1 in/21.2 out. That translates to exactly the low latency I was hoping for when I read other reviews; when I hit the key, I get the sound - instantly. It's incredible how much that helps when recording.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze and I opted for the most recent driver from the website and had no issues installing or integrating with my DAW. One really cool aspect to this device is it can read from both inputs at the same time. I hooked up my Berhinger mixer's L/R outs to the ins on the Focusrite and am able to get a stereo mix with the additional control and connectivity afforded by my mixer. Big plus!<br /><br />Oh and noise? Practically non-existent even with my computer fan running in the background. I would always recommend slapping a gate on top to cover your bases, but it's not essential the way it would be with cheaper devices.<br /><br />I'm incredibly happy with my choice. It's even better than I was hoping. And a big thanks to the other reviewers; you really helped make my decision easier.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Chromecast is such a great idea......except when it falls in the hands of a control freak that controls everything but their design and quality. Google is basically using us as guinea pigs for product research and market research while having us finance that research.<br /><br />I was debating if it should be a 1 or 2 star review. I think I would have preferred 1.5 stars, since it's not totally useless.<br /><br />1. Netflix and youtube work: Surprise, something actually works. It doesn't work all that well. Half of the time, my android netflix doesn't even have cast enabled. It actually works better on the iphone. Youtube is in the same boat, but in slightly worse shape. It's difficult to use in android and in ios. And again, on the adroid, it doesn't get \\"Cast\\" half of the time.<br /><br />2. Setup.....the worst designed setup procedure of anything I have ever purchased. I swear that even my made in china treadmill with god knows what manual was easier to set up. If you have more than 1 wireless router in your house, you may be screwed. If you are able to, turn them all off except for one. Hopefully you can get it within the range of the chromecast dongle and whatever the device you use to set it up......and no, setup only works from chrome.<br /><br />3. Streaming from chrome......it also works but at lower resolution and it freezes and crashes all the time. Think first gen android.<br /><br />4. Stonewalling developers...that's why when someone comes up with an app to support local content streaming that just about everyone wants, Google goes and breaks it. The worst of all, they flat out lie about it. Google, how dumb do you think we are? We know you want the control, just admit it.<br /><br />5. I don't know how long it's going to last, but it runs very hot. I don't think it knows when and how to turn itself off. Even if your TV is off, this thing is still cranking out heat. I probably is too small to affect your electricity bill, but it can't last too long with the kind of careless design that constantly running at a high temperature even when it's not supposedly in use.<br /><br />All in all, it's a poor man's roku box that just doesn't work too well. If you got it for 11 bucks, you might as well keep it. If you paid $35, I feel for you. We got ripped off.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a great device for being able to transmit videos from your device (iPhone, iPad, Google phone) to a TV.  Fairly easy to set up and operate.  I think this was a great idea by Google!  Will probably buy another one for the other TV.

B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My son Jason recently turned three and we are working on his letters and numbers. We had been struggling to keep his interest until we tried Alphabet Aquarium Vol 1: Animated Puzzle. After just a short time playing this game my boy was completely hooked and now he just loves to play this game when we are going on car rides and has even passed up on watching cartoons so that he could play.<br />There are so many great things about this game; it would be hard for me to say exactly why this game is so popular with my son. To start with, the games visuals are way above par for this type of app. There are a wide variety of skillfully drawn characters, each adding their own personality to the mix. The games narration is equally delightful, with a melodious lady sounding very motherly as she walks the children through the game. However, in my opinion the best part is how repetitive the game is. As any parent knows, the most important thing when you are teaching a child anything is that the lessons are repetitive, to help the child fully grasp the lesson.<br />The game is actually made up of four separate mini games for each letter of the alphabet, each designed to teach a separate lesson about the letter. The first lesson, and my favorite, teaches the different parts of that make up the letter. Unlike most games, which simply have the kids trace the letter this game breaks the letter into individual components. I feel like this is important, because in real life, most people have hand writing which is not picture perfect. Being able to recognize a letter by its base parts has already helped my son recognize letters when handwritten. There are also two amusing games where the child learns to recognize shapes and pictures that start with the letter. Jason's favorite game is one where he solves a puzzle to reveal a cute animated animal. The narrator will also read the letter and the name of the animal it starts with.<br />Over all, this has to be my favorite of the kid's games I have tried on Amazon. It is fun, engaging and best of all, educational.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This type of game always challenges my brain. At my age, it helps keep me sharp. It always makes me want more.
0812981448|5.0|I was in love with this book and could not put it down! There were so many great points that anyone and everyone can implement. I hope Blake writes another book!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A breathless binge read.  True characters and personalities; all of them.  There wasn't a plastic person in the whole thing.  Full of detail and king can really paint a picture that you feel you are EXPERIENCING real time, not merely seeing or reading about.  You are there.  King is a magician.  I hope he lets us see into Abra's life a few years down the Pike.  Magic.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only, and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of The Game is excellent.  Sharp details, with no noticeable film grain.  Artifacts, dirt and noise have all been eliminated.  The blacks are deep; flesh tones are warm; and other colors like blue and red really pop.  The sound is also superb.  Both dialogue and soundtrack are strong and clear.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.  Thank you, Criterion, for another excellent transfer of a great film.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I never tried to use these games becausd my brain never seemed to comprehend how to do them. thisapp starts slow and builds. I get it now!

B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|This was interesting concept in the story line. Like most of this author's stories, this left more that should have been there - the story ends with too many lose ends not tied up to end the story. It was a good book.

1476727651|5.0|DOCTOR SLEEP is all sorts of great things. It is first and foremost the sequel to THE SHINING. To this day, I remember the woman in the bathtub and the sisters in the hallway. Every time I check into a large hotel with interior halls, I expect to see those girls at the very end. That is brilliant writing. There are similar moments in this follow-up, which I'm sure I won't forget. The book is also a big wet kiss to Alcoholics Anonymous and at times will scare the heck out of you.<br /><br />The story picks up some three years or so after THE SHINING ends. Danny's life is not wonderful. The remaining two-thirds of the Torrance family did not win the lottery; they did escape with their lives, but not much else. Danny, though, still has the gift, and the Overlook isn't quite done with him. The result is that Danny (who becomes Dan as the book jumps forward) is an alcoholic of grand proportion, more likely to die of the Irish fever than of the machinations of a ghostly bartender. Wandering aimlessly and at times running purposefully, Dan gets off the bus in a small town in New Hampshire where he is thrown a lifeline and, with alternating gratitude and reluctance, takes hold of it, attending meetings and doing the steps. He ultimately obtains a job as an orderly in a local hospice, where he uses his \\"gift\\" --- his \\"shine\\" --- to help ease the passing of those about to die. He acquires a benevolent reputation for what he does (and no one knows quite what he does), and if all isn't entirely well, it's not all bad, either.<br /><br />Meanwhile, two other things are occurring. The first is that Dan is receiving messages of sorts from someone who senses a kindred spirit in him. That somebody is a very young girl named Abra, who lives some 20-odd miles from Dan and whose shine is far greater than Dan's ever was. The second is that Abra, as she grows older, attracts the unwelcome attention of a group of psychic feeders who call themselves the True Knot. The Knot wanders the country in a loose configuration of campers and RVs, feeding off the psychic misery of what they refer to as the Rubes --- the non-Knots, if you will --- which its members use to sustain themselves physically and otherwise. Young people with the shine are the best source of this, as is demonstrated in a particularly horrific passage (I will never see a baseball glove again without thinking of this book).<br /><br />As Abra reaches the cusp of adolescence, the True Knot encounters a problem --- one that, deliciously enough, is of its own making --- that might see its resolution through the extremely unwilling participation of Abra. Dan and Abra ultimately join forces, physically and psychically, to combat the True Knot's plan, but they are up against a group and a leader whose ability to deceive may far exceed their own. The final battleground is a familiar one, as the ultimate face-off is effected, at least in part, by a figure from the past.<br /><br />Some of King's best writing to date is found in DOCTOR SLEEP. I'll never look at an RV on the highway or the folks inside the same way again. There are many clever and wonderful turns of phrase here, as well as a nod to a couple of other literary universes (Joe Hill's and Linwood Barclay's, interestingly enough). Those who expect a rehash of THE SHINING will not get it. The book's claustrophobic setting within a hotel over the course of a few weeks is replaced here with a tale that jumps forward over decades and moves from Colorado to Florida to New Hampshire to...well, I'm not going to tell you that. Read the book and find out.<br /><br />Oh, and Constant Author? To answer the query posed in your Author's Note at the end of DOCTOR SLEEP, we're not just all good. We're great, and rounding the corner and heading toward terrific. Thank you.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

B00BEIYP8A|4.0|Any racing fan will tell you that racing is only as interesting as the rivalries between the drivers.  This should come as no surprise since rivalry prompts individual drive, forcing the competitors to be on the top of their game - with the ultimate goal of victory.  Just a few of the countless and illustrious rivalries in the world of motorsports has included both driver and manufacturer.  On the manufacturing side, there has almost always been a long standing competition between the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro.  Once you move on from the manufacturer rivalry, there are team rivalries, one of which is the ongoing feud between Hendrick Motorsports and Penske Racing in the Sprint Cup Series, a feud that began when the series was still known as the Winston Cup Series.  And, since we're talking about the Winston Cup Series, it's absolutely impossible to forget the rich and always entertaining feud between Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon.  However, before the Earnhardt met Gordon, possibly the greatest rivalry in all of racing had already taken place - in the Formula One Series.  Of course, this rivalry - between James Hunt and Niki Lauda is the subject of the new biopic, Rush.<br /><br />Hollywood legend Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon, The Da Vinci Code) directs Rush, the parallel true story about Formula One race car drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) in the 1970s.  Hunt is a womanizing playboy, reckless behind the wheel, and egotistical to the max - but he knows how to win races.  On the flip side, Lauda is a \\"straight edge\\" driver that focuses solely on winning.  At the height of his career, Hunt first experiences Lauda as he buys his way into racing, quickly making a name for himself by winning an F1 champion - at Hunt's expense, of course.  With each passing race, the two drivers intertwine with one another more and more, often trading wins - at least until an unfortunate accident sidelines Lauda, essentially changing their relationship forever.  Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara, and Pierfrancesco Favino also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />Depending how you feel about racing and motorsports, this film has the potential to either feel like a high-octane trip down memory lane or like watching cars simply drive in a circle for two hours (the equivalent for some of watching paint dry).  Honestly, and this comes from someone that grew up during the era of Earnhardt/Gordon - it can be a bit of both.  If you're hoping for constant wreckage and fistfights between Hunt and Lauda, you're going to be massively disappointed.  That's not who these guys were, and their relationship was not as aggressive as the rivalries between Earnhardt and Gordon or the current petty fights between countless drivers all over modern motorsports.  It would be impossible to describe the relationship between Hunt and Lauda as a gentlemen's relationship, but it's not as though they hated each other either.  In fact, it would appear that they despised each other far more in this film than in real life.  However you'd describe their relationship, it was certainly entertaining and a big deal for the F1 Series.<br /><br />Without a doubt, Rush is dominated by the onscreen presence of Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br&uuml;hl.  Not only do the characters portrayed in this film push one another to greatness, but these two exquisite actors also push each other, endlessly feeding thriving in their respective roles.  Hemsworth portrays a brash, borderline alcoholic that loves the limelight, while Br&uuml;hl is calm, collected and ready for business.  The egos of these two characters may be on the opposite side of the spectrum in terms of how they go about their lives off the track, but on the track - there might be no better pair to mirror one another in the history of motorsports. On the outside, their relationship may have appeared to be of the tumultuous variety, but this film portrays them as men desperate to out dueone another on the track.  There's a great deal of admiration for men like that.<br /><br />Obviously, since Rush is centered squarely on two men, it doesn't leave a whole lot of room for supporting characters to make an impression.  This will come as disappointing news for Oliva Wilde fans, as she only briefly appears in the film - as Hunt's wife and eventual ex-wife.  Although she can be a compelling actress (based on certain roles), she isn't allotted the time to leave a meaningful impression.  However, Wilde's counterpart, Alexandra Maria Lara, portrays Niki Lauda's wife - and is present for much more emotional and engaging scenes.  Through sheer silly luck, Lara's character meets her future husband as she's leaving a party, and from there, her character is enthralled with Niki's drive and passion for racing.  The complexity of the Lauda marriage is given far more screen time, while the Hunt marriage is depicted as nothing more than a brief shame, in an attempt to give James Hunt a more acceptable public appearance.  In defense of the film's lopsidedness, James Hunt does spend much of his time womanizing rather than romancing.<br /><br />For anyone that's a fan of the 1990 racing flick Days of Thunder, you might just enjoy Rush as much, possibly more - unless you have a bias for stock cars over open wheel cars.  It's brutally obvious that a comparison to Days of Thunder and Rush is not fair (based on the overall quality of the completed products), but you can't help but look at the storyline involved with each film and see some familiar parallels.  Both focus on egotistical men, followed by a tragic accident that defines the film, and finally, each flick ultimately ends in a positive nature.  The quality of acting in Rush is far more impressive than in Days of Thunder, but it's hard not to look at Rush as something more than Thor womanizing, drinking, and trying to play Tom Cruise.  This shouldn't take away from the performance of Hemsworth, but as far as the entertainment value goes, it feels like there should be an asterisk next to Rush - since it obviously came nearly 25 years later, yet still resembling a similar story.<br /><br />Overall, Rush is a biopic that tells an interesting story, but does it using a plot that still feels far too familiar.  Unfortunately, the real life relationship between James Hunt and Niki Lauda was not as dramatic as it's made out to be in the film.  Still, Director Ron Howard creates a nice, free flowing film that rivals his work on his previous accolades, including Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind.  With quite a bit of Oscar buzz around it, the question becomes:  is Rush a serious Oscar contender?  If Rush can remain relevant despite peaking early, it should be appear to climb its way into contention.  Although a high entertainment value is present in this film, very little about it screams Academy Award.<br /><br />GRADE:  B-<br />FNDNreview.comon the track.

B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun, addicting game. Different degrees make it more challenging. I enjoy creating each scene and aporeciate not having any pop up ads.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|i haven't personally played it but my son loves everything Angry Birds and says this is great. He is 9.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Everything about this book and the entire trilogy was a delight to read. I'm actually a bit upset now that I've finished them :(
B000MCIBAW|5.0|What can I say? Classic Doors, they are as awesome today as they were 40 years ago! A timeless band!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my second time reading the series.  When my preordered copy of Dust  (the last book in the series) downloaded to my Kindle I was overjoyed.  I couldn't just read it though.  I wanted to immerse myself in the Silo again before finding out how it all ends.  I'm so glad I did.  It felt like I was visiting with old friends.  I had truly missed the characters.  Life in the Silo is like nothing you've ever imagined. The characters are well developed and easy to love, or hate as the case may be.  The story makes you reflect quite a bit.  There really is no right or wrong way...it's all about perspective on survival.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series.  This is a collection that I'll treasure and most likely will return to again and again.<br /><br />I've gotta go...I'm off to First Shift (and the saga continues).
0736092269|5.0|It explained the differences in many different workouts and how to tweak them in order to work specific muscles within the muscle group.
B006LSZECO|1.0|completely drops off. no closure or conclusion, perhaps that is the point. the ultimate letdown of any book i have ever read.
B008Y212PI|5.0|fun to play. can play a quick game or since it is so addictive play several at once. I really love it
B008Y212PI|3.0|Demands review to advance I FIND this to be very annoying. The puzzles are ok if a little simple.  I have hope for the more advanced  levels.
B0064MGU98|5.0|One of the best shows out there!  So nice to be able to watch it for free with my Prime membership WITHOUT any commercials!  I watch it in the POP OUT viewing mode so that I can do my home computer work while still enjoying the show.
B00DV3A84G|5.0|I began listening to Bastille after randomly hearing Pompeii on Pandora. I took a listen to Things We Lost in the Fire and Laura Palmer...after that I decided to purchase the mp3 album.<br /><br />There are nuances of Ellie Goulding and Florence and the Machine, but Bastille does have a flavor all its own that I cannot describe. The comparisons are made because I like the two performers; and since Bastille is similar, it makes for easy listening to me.<br /><br />Rarely do I like an album beyond two or three songs. I enjoy every single track of Bad Blood.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|this rules. I cant believe its only $35. I hear many more apps are coming.  It turns the TV in for you
B005LAIIMG|3.0|I've seen so many previews and clips it probably spoiled the film for me. The idea of super fast,almost super human killer zombies climbing on top of each other to scale a wall is a bit ridiculous but was original for the traditional slow and go zombie crowd. Once the screaming kid and mother are dumped off on the ship, the movie is ok until the ending which sucks..Part 2 coming??
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really liked this game. I was surprised at the amount of time that passed.Hopefully, this developer will do more. The game is very Zen-like. I was really relaxed when playing this game, which helps after a frustrating day at work, believe it or not.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is just a lot of fun.  I like fast moving action in a game.  no complicated rules.  Good for seniors.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This trilogy is good. They were put in a hard spot and I honestly didn't know how the story would end. Would they all die? Would they survive? Would they be allowed to survive from all sides?
B004QYTRRS|4.0|The best movie that I have seen in a long time is The Tourist.<br /><br /> The Tourist was a fantastic and yet sensational movie.  It as Johnny Depp starring in it.  I loved the movie the whole way through.  It is about this girl from the agency.  She gets a note from a guy that stole a lot of money, and is says find someone that looks like me from the train.  I will not tell you the rest because that will ruin the movie.  It is a wonderful movie.<br /><br /> My personal experience watching the movie for the first time was laying in bed with a bunch of popcorn and eating it up really fast because it is dramatic and mysterious.  The only bad thing about it is that it is rated PG 13.  I would suggest only for kids 13 and older.  It is not in theaters anymore but it is on apple t.v. not netflix.  You may be able to rent it though.  It is my favorite movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved the scary carnival theme. Great graphics. Great Story line. Good music.  Loved that when you weren't sure where to go next the hint button would prompt your direction.  Absolutely loved the helpful monkey!
B009K0OPQQ|5.0|Once Upon A Time<br />After I finished watching the first episode of Once Upon A Time, I could not stop watching it.  I watched both seasons on netflix, and I can't wait for number three to be on hulu.  It is a very intense show.  I think it is a fantastic series,  I loved it!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I Love it. Very addicting! I Keep saying one more game, then play another and another. Very good brain game.
0385737955|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read<br />Maze Runner<br /><br />  Maze runner is a great book. I enjoyed every moment I read the book. It was so interesting, it was hard to put it down. I really thought it was worth the money I paid for the book. It obviously has a front and back cover, with pages(obviously), words(obviously), and page numbers. It's not very big, but it is a little bigger that some books I've read. I think this book is great, you definitely won't be disappointed when you are reading it. If you are about nine or under I don't recommend it to you but anyone older than that I highly recommend it to you.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|kept me on my feet the whole time I loved it! I would recommend to any girl over the age of 18
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|the walking dead review<br /><br />The walking dead is my favorite TV show. the first time i watched it, of course it was the same some background story, of any other zombie show. the characters are really good, their acting is decent.<br /> the plot line is phenomenal, how in season 2 they move in to a farm.<br />as in season 3 they were going house to house, then they found a prison to stay in. then they somehow, they get in a big conflict<br /><br />with the people of Woodbury.That caused a lot of tension, especially<br />with the death of Lori, Merl, and Andrea.  But i am really excited for season 4, and walking dead is an awesome show.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This was one of the BEST seasons ever i wish that i could buy every season of it not just because it is ausome it(AND IT IS)the seeker in it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo HOT
142314189X|5.0|When I first started reading the Percy Jackson series, I instantly fell in love with them. This series has five books in all, with each having about three hundred pages. The author is Rick Riordan, and boy is he a good writer!!! They are all fantasy, which I love, and most people love too! These books, are honestly so good! They kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading them. I could never ever put the books down. I can read them over and over and never have them get boring. When I was coming to an end of the last book, I got so sad that that was the end of all of them. I was literally heartbroken. All I can say about the books (cause I don't want to spoil it for you) is that it has tons of Greek Mythology, and lots of action. The main character, Percy Jackson, is twelve years old, and not like anybody else. He's very different. When on vacation, something happens and he goes to a special camp. You'll just have to read them to find out more! Any age group of people who read it would love it. Most everybody else who has read them, love it too! These books won't let you down! They're the best!!!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I got this as the free app of the day and I am enjoying it. It makes your brain work a little but not too much, I find it relaxing..
B0017XD3OY|5.0|\\"I Am Legend\\", is an amazing movie of a person who finds a cure for cancer.  But all it does is turn the world upside down. The cure mutates them, almost as if they<br />where zombies.<br />This movie is full of action, and at the rating of PG-13, I would think any teen would like this movie... unless they don't like scary movies.<br />The first time I watched this movie I was scared out of my socks, but the second and third time it wasn't as bad, because I knew when the jumps were.<br />Either way I thought it was a great movie, and it had a great plot line too.  So if you are looking for a great movie for those loud and noisy teens, then this is<br />just the movie you're looking for. And go ahead try it for yourself too.<br />But if anything I would give it a five star rating.
B00E8UZM42|4.0|There were two different factors that drove me to pick up this book.  One, the author was a participant in National Novel Writer's Month (an event where you have a month to write a 50,000 word manuscript), and I wanted to see the fruits of a fellow participant's labors.  And two, it was part of a literary genre that I personally enjoy -- that of the \\"retold\\" fairy tale.  Cinderella stories have been done to death, but the twist of \\"Cinder\\" taking place in a futuristic world -- and Cinder herself being a cyborg mechanic instead of a scullery maid -- was enough to intrigue me.  The fact that I'm a science fiction fan and find robotics and cyborgs in general fascinating didn't hurt matters either.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Cinder\\" turned out to be fairly predictable (though I guess I should have expected that) and containing a few clich&eacute;s and plot holes.  But it was still entertaining enough that I kept reading, and look forward to picking up the sequel.<br /><br />Linh Cinder is a cyborg mechanic in New Beijing, working to support her cold stepmother and stepsisters -- the cruel Pearl and the friendly but somewhat airheaded Peony.  She has no memory of her past, only knows that as a cyborg she's considered less than human and little more than her stepmother's property.  It's not until she catches the eye of Kai, prince of the Eastern Commonwealth, that she starts to believe her life can get better.  But dual threats loom over the Commonwealth -- a terrible plague with no cure, and the eerie, powerful Lunar people, descendants of moon colonists who seek to conquer the Earth through conspiracy and war.  Cinder soon finds herself in possession of secrets that could save or ruin the world, and discovers some terrible truths about herself in the process... truths that could get her killed.<br /><br />Meyer has created a vivid and imaginative futuristic world, with some of the familiar trappings of sci-fi tales of the past (androids, cyborgs, hover-vehicles, ID chips) but with a few unique twists that make it stand out (the Lunars, with their ability to manipulate bio-electric fields as a sort of \\"magic\\").  Elements of the original fairy tale are present as well, but with updated twists -- the glass slipper becomes a cybernetic foot, the pumpkin coach becomes an outdated car scavenged from a junkyard, etc.  The only element lacking is the Fairy Godmother, for this Cinderella has enough guts to act on her own instead of waiting for someone to bail her out.  It could be argued that a friendly scientist was meant to stand in for her Fairy Godmother, but that's a stretch at best...<br /><br />This story does fall into some standard clich&eacute;s, however.  It seems the new twist for new versions of Cinderella is to make one stepsister good and one bad -- as is the case with Peony and Pearl.  While this isn't necessarily a bad thing -- [[ASIN:B001KWTBVQ Ever After: A Cinderella Story]] pulled it off quite well -- Peony does little to help the plot.  And the plague subplot felt ultimately useless and forced, and as other reviewers have pointed out, it creates a number of logical fallacies (why invite the public to a festival when there's a communicable disease going around?).  Perhaps the plague plays a further role in the sequels?  I can only wait and see, I suppose.<br /><br />Also, the revelation of Cinder's past at the end of the book wasn't much of a revelation -- the author drops too many heavy-handed hints toward the beginning, which pretty much gives away the big twist.  I suppose I shouldn't expect a Shylaman-style twist from a retelling of an already-familiar tale, but still, I feel this could have been handled just a little better.<br /><br />Not high literature, \\"Cinder\\" is still a decent book, and it kept me reading to the very end.  I do plan on picking up the sequel, \\"Scarlet,\\" and on following the \\"Lunar Chronicles\\" quartet to the last book.  Supposedly the next book will be following a futuristic Little Red Riding Hood as well as continuing Cinder's tale...continuing Cinder's tale...
B00499K9E0|5.0|This is a terrific series with an updated version of Sir Arthur Conan Dolye's Sherlock Holmes, set in contemporary London. Benedict Cumberbatch is spot-on as a not-so-lovable Holmes and Martin Freeman plays Dr. Watson, who serves as Holmes' conscience and adviser. Establishing characters was well done in this first episode.  The rest of the series is equally as good. This is NOT CBS-TV's \\"Elementary.\\" It's much better.  Highly recommended!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|its a really good alarm clock to use and to wake you up in the morning you should download it if you want to wake up early
B008Y212PI|4.0|Like the premise of the game. Think the instructions could be better written and demonstrated. Great logic game though and I'm enjoying it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Short, but excellent, I would recommend for anyone to understand, simple terms and yet easy to understand.  Can't say enough on this author, Dr Wayne Dyer recommended it, and I loved his books, impressed me.  I actually did the practices, and need to keep staying in focus on keeping alert for changes and seeing the universe work it's miracles.
0062239422|4.0|INTO THE DARKEST CORNER by Elizabeth Haynes is quite a page turner, just as all the reviews promise. Don't be put off at first when the book has short chapters on various years, and you think the book is a hassle and too difficult to keep track of. Because that won't last for long. The majority of the novel alternates between 2003 to 2004 and 2007 to 2008.<br /><br />Before springtime 2003, Catherine drank too much, went to too many pubs, picked up too many men, and had too much sex with strangers. Then she meets Lee.<br /><br />For a period in 2003 to 2004, Catherine still drinks too much, but we see the progression of her relationship with Lee. Or should I say REgression? Because Lee turns out to be psychotic. You may get sick of all the drinking and sex, but these chapters are intense, and you won't want to stop reading to see if and how Catherine escapes. Besides, these are short chapters that alternate with 2007 to 2008. So you'll get a break.<br /><br />2007 to 2008 is Catherine after Lee. But these chapters, too, turn out to be frightening. Will she ever escape Lee?<br /><br />The book had some problems.<br /><br />When a book contains sex scenes in every other chapter, that's usually a sign of poor writing. A novel isn't good if it resorts to lots of sex for lack of a good story.<br /><br />But in the case of INTO THE DARKEST CORNER, Catherine's partying, drinking, and having lots of sex in 2003 to 2004 is a contrast to the Catherine in 2007 to 2008. Her behavior then emphasizes her behavior later.<br /><br />But it's also a sign of poor writing when the main character refuses to tell people important things. And that's what happens sometimes. Lucky for Haynes that she wrote such a page turner or she wouldn't get away with that cheap tactic to keep the tension going.<br /><br />I won my copy of INTO THE DARKEST CORNER from [...]
0425263924|5.0|Love how they get back together after talking things out not just have sex! Enjoy reading it for it captivates with its ups and downs!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Thank you to Stephen King for letting us readers find out what happened to Danny Torrance and Dick Hallorann of [[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]]. Every time I reread \\"The Shining,\\" the questions would pop up again, making me wonder what happened AFTER the events at The Overlook.<br /><br />I would have liked (personally) to know more about Danny's younger/teen life but \\"Doctor Sleep\\" focuses on his mid-years. But King's storytelling is at its best. I enjoyed new character Abra Stone. I enjoyed the twists and turns through good and evil that King took me through. There was just enough backstory from \\"The Shining\\" to let a new reader know what was going on or catch up a reader that hadn't read the classic in a while.<br /><br />I didn't find \\"Doctor Sleep\\" to be as spine chillingly scary as \\"The Shining\\" but then a lot of years have passed and I have many more years experience under my belt than that very young woman who first read the book or saw the movie. I think the difference is that in \\"The Shining\\" I felt like the events in the story could REALLY happen. In \\"Doctor Sleep\\" it felt more like storytelling. I don't know if I'm expressing myself clearly on this difference or not.<br /><br />What I did find was an exceptionally well-written book that held my interest all the way through and answered questions I didn't even know I had.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My daughter love this, for doing her homework . It has the large numbers and easy to operator. Great for kids
B006LS7DQE|2.0|The game does not run nearly as well on tablets as it does on pc, and there seems to be a serious issue with the difficulty level. Normal cheats like mad (six 5-gem combos before I even get a turn?!) and easy is far too easy.

B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I really liked that book because about the cheese touch and the they also did the cheese touch in my school in the past! In my school they have a program called safety patrol and in the morning the fifth graders that tried out watch the kindergartens in the morning.Every year except this year the kids would watch kindergarten and first grade during lunch and recess.Also the kids that do safety patrol also get into first period later then everyone else
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game was better than I expected, i thought that this game was going to be boring and dull like some of the other games i tried. But it wasn't.
B007MHVVCU|5.0|This book gave suspense action and just an interesting plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat definitely a good read for all ages
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Dawkins and his contemporaries have the reputation for being aggressively angry religion to the point of being turn-offish. I was pleasantly surprised at how human and approachable this book was. Even the parts I didn't necessarily agree with have given me something to think about and I can't ask for anything more from a book. I recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|thought it would work on all android devices , got it,it does  work on kindle fire ,you could list what it does not work on and the problems you may have,had a kindle it started working after I bought a galaxy tab 2 ,and netflix will not work on galaxy tab 2 ,it has alot of problems one day it will be a great thing to own now its a pain
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was brilliantly plotted by the master mind of course John Green. He gives you what you want and then he throws it in your face like a stale sandwich. As in the title this is the only book that made me shed much more than just a tear,he made my heart ache and break at the same time. John Green is a Genius!
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Rented this movie, just cause, at Blockbuster - it is a WONDERFUL story!  Had to own a copy.  Happy with cost & delivery.  Thank you!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Sharpens my semi-serrated pocketknife easily. Could be used as a weapon itself in an emergency. I like the ceramic smoothing
B005CMSDLE|5.0|This is an action movie about a girl that is trained to be a spy.  When she is ready to survive on her own, she is given a task (of whom she must kill).
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Best family-friendly video game ever. Very entertaining, for ages 3 to 103. If you can push a button and aim the controller, you can enjoy this.
B00BSW6F26|3.0|I know these apps aren't exactly written by Shakespear but I was expecting a little bit more especially from a game as visually adept as MoDB.  The graphics are beautiful and the music is pretty good.  A few of the puzzles are actually challenging first time around.  But the story is too simplistic for my taste and the conclusion is unsatisfying.  It's worth playing but maybe only once.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Love this app.  Playing the AI set to 5 (the max) feels like I am playing my Grandfather all over again.  He was a very good and amazingly lucky player.  Game play is smooth.  Having an undo feature is nice as well.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun game to play. Great for when you want to relax and not think about other things. I have enjoyed it.
B001GCUO4S|3.0|This movie is ok but the first one was the best. I don't know how many movies of this kind the writers can put out because how many more ideas can they come up with.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I'm not much for crime books, but these thrillers are substantial and have kept me enamoured for the past three weeks. Must read.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I have seen all of these 24. just wish they would have kept it going. I am a great fan of kiefer's and his dad's
B009UOI9UK|3.0|This lens hood looks great on my camera , but the tag price is really ridiculous !!!<br />175 $ for a round piece of metal ?? Any ways Sony should reconsider the pricing for their accessories .
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it from start to finish, although I was a little unsure about the ending. It's realistic though, so now I cannot wait for the movie! Hopefully Hollywood does not screw it up.
145210655X|2.0|The story began with some fun references to the original movie, but the story was thin and really didn't make much sense. I sent it back, didn't even finish it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I have read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and &#34;Dark Places&#34; and loved both of those books, but I think &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; is my favorite of the three. If you like mysteries with an edge to them, you will love this book.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time it the best game ever I was so happy when it came out
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really enjoy Gillian Flynn's view of things. It is not perfect, but there are many redeeming qualities to her main characters in this book and you really feel each character's point of view. The only thing I found disappointing was the chapter that dealt with the main character's father. There were a few unanswered questions for me from that chapter. I would still recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery that delves into how families relate to one another and what people are willing to do to survive.

B008Y212PI|5.0|This game takes you step by step to learn nonograms.  The last faotd for nonograms did just not explain it well (the other day). This games tutorial is much better.  At first very exciting, but as I'm finishing the 5x5 become a bit monotonous.  Soon on to  more difficult puzzles.  This review gets you an unlock at the end of 5x5' s.

B00000IMYA|5.0|I had the original pressing of the old CD and thought the sound was a bit weird and the applause seemed canned, but being an Ellington fan, had to have it.<br /><br />Then I got this one-and it blew my mind.  Now there have been a few reviews here that have noted the somewhat lackluster parts of the set, and this is true.  \\"Day In, Day Out\\" is forgettable as is \\"Tuneup or Tulip,\\" and the \\"Festival Suite\\" obviously shows lack of rehearsal, but for the \\"Diminduendo and Crescendo in Blue\\" this set is worth it.  One thing that no one has pointed out-when Gonzalves begins his epic solo he is in a different key from the band, but after 4 bars adjustments are made and he is off.  It is too bad no film exists of this number, only a few still photographs-it would be interesting to actually see that woman who was so captivating the crowd with her dancing during the solo and to see the crowds reaction as this steamroller of a number just swept everyone away.  Probably the closest we will get is the section of the Ken Burns JAZZ documentary that discusses the concert.<br /><br />All I can say is this-there are very few indispensable jazz concerts that actually got recorded:  Goodman's 1938 Carnegie Hall concert, Ellington's 1943 CH concert (that introduced \\"Black, Brown & Beige\\") and this one, Brubeck at CH, Erroll Garner's \\"Concert by the Sea,\\"  John Hammond's \\"Spirituals to Swing\\" concerts, Satchmo at Town Hall, Miles Davis at the Fillmore...there is something about hearing jazz in a live setting that makes what might sound a bit dry in a studio come alive in front of the right crowd.  If you don't find yourself getting worked up by the time Gonzalves finishes, you just don't love jazz.

B00006EXDM|5.0|This includes just about every hit from their early years.  I do wonder about the song Play With Fire.  Apparently there are two versions of it- one that appears on Hot Rocks and sells for $1.29 as a download, and another that appears on the Big Hits album and sells for $.99 as a download.  What is the difference between them?
1401922732|3.0|I'm a big fan (and collector) of Oracle Cards and I've always loved Archangel Michael. However, I have to say that I felt that this deck was boring and not the most respectful portrayal of this beloved Archangel. Many of the illustrations are gritty -- to be honest, it's pretty well-known that Doreen Virtue is more commercial than she is a spiritual teacher (and you can see this when it comes to her having a wide variety of decks that are inconsistent in energy and niche).<br /><br />It seems that she just threw this deck together to get another deck out there for more money. I didn't feel like a lot of love, respect, and reverence went into this deck.
B00D9PUXQY|5.0|When I first heard Devildriver, i was blown away.  Over the years I have purchased every single album released, and I can honestly say quality has never dropped, but I can't say I have ever been particularly impressed with any single album.  The sad fact is every album sounds very similar, with a trained ear its definitely possible to hear the subtle differences, however even I have trouble distinguishing which songs belong to which album some time.<br /><br />I'm not saying thats a bad thing because i love their music, but it also means with each new album I hope to fall in love with it like I did with their self titled debut, but so far I haven't......<br />until now.<br /><br />  Winter Kills has an edge, a feel that reminds me of listening to them for the first time.  Every song, every lyric lights a fire inside of me.  Since WKs release I have literally listened to it every day, each day finding a new hook to obsess over, a new riff stuck in my head, and its even inspired me to re-listen to all their past releases.<br /><br />I have quite literally fell back in love with this band, I can't say for sure what it is that makes this album stand out from the rest, but the constant eargasms i have received from this album will stay with me for life, Thank you DevilDriver for Winter Kills, easily top five favorite of all time.

B00A6CCF0K|1.0|Mr. King used to be an entertaining, occasionally brilliant, writer. His Dark Tower series was a model of story telling with pace, ingenuity and momentum maintained over a very protracted series. Now he seems to have been replaced with a schlock robot.<br /><br />Apparently, somewhere in America, there are legions of people whose lives are so sheltered, so soporific that they read about child torture and sexual abuse and regard it as fine entertainment. Oh, and vivid descriptions of alcoholism tossed in for free. I got about as far as page 150 or so and quit.  To pick the least repulsive example: early on we have a scene with Dan hung over, maybe strung out, waking naked next to a young, maybe teenage, woman having had sex with her in a drunken stupor.  The woman is a druggie, lives in squalor and has a small, obviously neglected child.  Even though she is clearly destitute Dan steals her last money ($70), comforting himself that she can always sell drugs. OK so far. The scene establishes that Dan is bottoming out, having become a degenerate who preys on other degenerates.  The child isn't vital to the scene but that's a story decision and makes the whole thing more poignant.  More importantly, it gives Dan plenty to feel guilty about later.  However, then the author plays out the brutalization and eventual violent murder of the child.  This is depicted in bits and pieces over several pages which reduces even the shock effect.  There is worse in the book, but the point is there is not even a good story reason.  That would at least make it understandable but not excusable. Too much of this is too close to torture porn and Mr. King should be ashamed of himself. It is sheer exploitation.<br /><br />Mr. King could put his name on a t..d and people would buy it.  Come to think of it, that's what he has done here.

B009B1UZ7C|5.0|I'll admit it - I'm one of those music fans that thinks most great rock music was made in the past, from the golden 1960s through the Punk/New Wave era. Sometimes a new artist comes along to make me rethink my preferences. Jake Bugg is one of those artists. His debut disc is a stunner. I got this on a whim and I am totally hooked. It is my favorite album of the year. from the proto-rockabilly opener \\"Lightning Bolt\\" to the last note, this is one great bunch of songs and performances. I hear traces of Dylan, Donovan,The Violent Femmes,and Billy Bragg...but Bugg's vision is wholly his own. The production is also a plus - guitars pop and the drumming is excellent throughout. I first listened to \\"Jake Bugg\\" in my car (at maximum volume) and replayed \\"Seen it All\\" four times in a row.  What a great song. In the singles era, \\"Seen it All\\" would have blasted to the top of the charts. The first five songs are a terrific rush. The ballads that dominate the second half of the album can't match the lift-off, but all are solid and interesting. Bugg's voice is very distinctive and he puts across his lyrics with great conviction. This one is living in my CD changer and won't be coming out soon...at least until the next offering from this promising new artist.

B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app allowed me to quickly find dead spots in a friend's house and to make an informed purchase decision for a repeater. Too many times in the past I would throw money at a problem and hope it went away. Sometimes I got lucky and sometimes I wasted my money. With this for the specific problem of signal drop it was not a matter of luck - the app showed the real problem.<br /><br />Granted the root cause of a signal problem is beyond the scope of this meter, but it's nice to know whether or not a problem exists with the signal strength or the receiving nodes on a Wi-Fi network. Moreover, this is a wonderful tool for determining the optimal channel to select if you truly want to control multiple networks without conflicts.<br /><br />I loved the different display types that allowed me to select the best view of what was appropriate to measure, and the fact that I could cycle through them with a simple finger swipe as though I were browsing photos.  I found the simple meter to be the most useful for surveying signals and the needle reacted to my moving away from the router as well as obstructions like cinderblock walls with no latency.<br /><br />After I set use this to solve a real problem I played around with it in my own home and found some surprising dead spots where I never suspected any existed, plus some decent signal reception where I thought it would drop off to poor quality. Apparently Wi-Fi signals are fickle, but this meter enabled me to accurately map out my own network signal strength throughout my property. It also showed how crowded the frequencies are from other neighboring devices.<br /><br />The important thing, though, is this installed quickly and is not only fast, but reliable. Unlike other apps I have downloaded for free this has a professional feel and is stable. For the record I am using this on a Samsung Galaxy Note II running Android 4.2.1.

B00E9O6C96|4.0|I've had my FiiO for about a week now, and enjoy it a lot.<br /><br />The unit comes with three screen protectors, one already mounted, a USB cable, and a cable so you can use the X3 to play music through your stereo, and a tiny instruction manual. It has 8gb internal memory, and a bonus copy of Dr. Chesky's Sensational, Fantastic, and Simply Amazing Binaural Sound Show, a collection of high-resolution files (the kind that an iPod cannot play). There are a few test sounds; the remainder are real songs which demonstrates the quality of the player. My player came fully charged, so I could enjoy it right away.<br /><br />I also bought a 32gb external chip (SanDisk class 10), which I simply inserted into the FiiO, and then connected the whole to my Mac via the included USB cable. Two discs immediately showed up on the desktop, the internal 8gb and the external 32gb. I dragged  the Mac music files  directly onto the desktop files. It takes an amazingly long time to copy 32gb of music, so if you can buy the SanDisc early and  preload the files, you'll be doing yourself a favor.<br /><br />FiiO, I think, works best for people who know what files they want, and where they want them. It allows nested folders; for example I have one folder named MISC, and inside that Indian, Chinese, Pop, etc, and in each of those a folder for each separate album. The iPod can't handle this, and I very much prefer the X3 style.<br /><br />I found the X3 easy to navigate; forward and back form a circle, so if you are at A Ceremony of Carols and want to navigate to Zap Mama, you just push the back button.  Once. Very fast. After a week, I can easily navigate in the dark. There are a couple of places FiiO could learn from Apple. While there is a battery level indicator, there are no warnings before the unit simply shuts down. Also, I haven't been able to get the unit to remember my position in a playlist, after I turn it off.<br /><br />I've listened to the X3 with the Sennheiser HD 598 open-air headphone, as well with the in-ear HifiMan RE 400. These are middle-of-the road phones, well-reviewed here on Amazon, and I think you need phones of this quality to hear what the X3 can do. Compared to an iPod, the sound did amaze me, as it has others. I didn't hear hiss or noise, even on cuts that played very noisily on  the iPod. The sound here was richer, clearer, and the instruments better defined.<br /><br />I also listen to music through my Mac, using a player that can handle high-rez files, a USB DAC to eliminate jitter, another DAC, amplifier, speakers and a bunch of pricey cables. How does the X3 compare? It's nowhere near as good, but then it doesn't cost in the thousands, either. The `big' system produces clearer sound that has a presence as though the performers are right in front of me; instruments like pianos and guitars have a very rich sound, clearly reproducing the reverberations and overtones of the acoustic instruments.<br /><br />The X3 has some of the clarity, but is much less rich. Still, the X3 fills an important niche for me, and I expect I'll continue what I do now -- listen to the X3 two hours every day, when I can't access the big stereo.<br /><br />I like it, I think the price is great, and I'm glad I bought it.headphone, as well with the in-ear HifiMan RE 400.

B0006B2A42|3.0|Eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes reportedly considered this his favorite movie, but don't hold that against it. In its dopey and predictable way it's quite entertaining - and one of the sequences, involving a malfunctioning torpedo tube, is heart-pounding. Based on a best-selling thriller by Alistair MacLean, the plot concerns the errant mission of an early spy satellite. Back then such spacecraft took reconnaissance photos on rolls of film and then ejected canisters that drifted back to Earth, where either U.S. or Soviet Union operatives would have to retrieve them. But in this story a Russian canister veers off course and ends up near a British polar \\"weather\\" station. Soon contact is lost with the station and a U.S. Navy submarine is dispatched on a secret mission to investigate and recover the canister. Of course there are many complications, double-crosses, confrontations and crises, but all-in-all it's not bad fluff. With Rock Hudson as the stiff and formal submarine commander, former football great Jim Brown as an SOB of a commando, Patrick McGoohan (star of the British TV series \\"Secret Agent\\") as an even bigger SOB of a ... secret agent, and Ernest Borgnine as a former Russian agent - whose accent borders on the ridiculous - now supposedly working for us. Veteran French composer Michel Legrand contributed the classy score. [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is likely known for its near real representation of life for the average &#34;Joe&#34; (U.S. military soldier) during World War II.  The cast did a marvelous job of portraying the life and attitudes of the American soldiers during that time period.  The director and crew only helped the matter by bringing the audience right into the picture in a way that, at times, made you feel like you were in the thick of things with the soldiers being represented.<br /><br />This series follows the lives of the soldiers of &#34;Easy&#34; Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, pulling from interviews with veterans from that outfit and sprinkling in a bit of Hollywood flare and pizazz.  The overall effect is a captivating look into the lives of an American soldier and how they handled the most stressful of situations (combat) and the most mundane periods between.  Ever wonder if soldiers enjoyed a little rest and relaxation while in combat?  How about, the sights and sounds of artillery and machine gun fire, while witnessing a tank advancing on your position?  That and much more are captured in this series in, what many military veterans, both old and young alike, have described as the closest you can get to the real thing while still in the comfort of your home.<br /><br />Overall, this collection is worth viewing and includes some great footage from interviews with actual veterans from the war.  Even the &#34;tin can&#34; that holds the movies in reminiscent of old ration containers used during the war - a nice touch to an already nice product.

If you are a guy, or an older individual, I could imagine you not enjoying this book to the extent I did. However, it was an essential read for myself, a confused 20-something girl trying to make sense of where I fit in this world. Cheryl writes so you feel her struggles are your own (and so often they are) and discovering how she meets those struggles was inspiring.
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|Will Smith's \\"strong father/military man\\" is laughable.  Jaden's \\"coming of age\\" was a joke.  Basically, Will Smith looks constipated the whole movie and Jaden looks like he's about to go in his pants.  The minute you see Shyalaman's name on a project... RUN!  Jaden is proving to be a weak/forced lead for a film.  If anything, this proves that the talents of the father do not translate to the son.  Maybe Jaden inherited more acting from his mother than his father and, well, yeah...

0515142247|3.0|I know I am reading these out of order, but this is the worst of the series so far in my opinion.  The villians are really lame.  I presume this came out a decade or so ago when CNN and CNBC were on a militia kick trying to say all these bizarre militia groups were out there holding right wing viewpoints and determined to destroy all the kittens and puppies in the world.  Actually, these networks were just trying to say that anyone with right of center viewpoints are kooks.  The ones in this novel, are so stupid that they couldn't organize a picnic, much less a revolution.  It was tiresome and I was tremendously disappointed.

B00607EWYC|4.0|A novel that is full of characters and metaphors, wisdom and grace.  I enjoyed how he used a character that was so very concerned with the ability to keep time to illuminate just how important it was to really live it.  Like any really good novel...this is one that brings new light and meaning to events in my own life.  I am very glad to have read it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love the drama and the twist in the story lines.  I like the mom and her cool temperament.  Like the different characters.
B00000FCBC|5.0|A great B-day gift for that any metal fan!!!!! I enjoy all types of music and wanted to bring back those old school days of having fun, and no worries.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual it's a fast read. I've read the last 7 installments Mitch Rapp gets better and better.  Hopefully there will be other books.
B00EBDXSCE|5.0|I never tire of this CD, just gets better with age( My age of course ) makes a great gift to any music fan.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again Mr. King has written a book about monsters that is also so full of heart it becomes completely plausible. Not a word is out of place in this thrilling story about what happened to the kid from the shining.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I had this tape back in high school, and it sounds way better on digital CD!!!!! A must have for any music collection in MY opinion.

B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game.l am a beginner on this one.The information on how to play was very good and simple to understand.I was hesitant about trying it.I'm so glad I did.Give it a try !!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great story that continues the life of Danny Torrance as an adult recovering alcoholic. Not as scary as the shining, but the memories of the Overlook gave me reminiscent chills. Well worth reading, another King great. A nice nod to Joe Hill's latest novel, NOS4A2 was a cool deal.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is the only game (other than Candy Crush) that I have to play daily. It has good graphics and it is fun I just wish it were easier to get pearls.

030758836X|3.0|I'm going to give a few disclaimers as to why this story didn't get more accolades from me...<br />1. I got this as a free audiobook. I had only ever listened to one other, a much shorter book... And it was through this novel that I realized that I CANNOT HANDLE audiobooks. I get distracted while listening, or fall asleep, or mostly I can't bear that I can't blaze through a novel as quickly as I want. This medium holds me hostage to the pace of the reader's voice.<br />2. Too much crudeness and vulgarity... And, I know that it probably is truly excessive when the girl who loves to think or say the F word multiple times in an hour, gets bored with it.<br /><br />I think that the plot and idea behind this book was brilliant. I love that Gillian gives you plenty of characters to hate. In all of her books. All kinds of antagonists with almost no protagonist. These characters are so flawed, so messed up, that you can't help but not like them. Well, at least that 's how it went for me.<br /><br />Were this not a 16 hour marathon for my ears, I may have enjoyed it more. Maybe...
0061726834|5.0|'They've lied about everything - about the fence, and the existence of the Invalids, about a million other things besides. They told us the raids were carried out for our own protection. They told us the regulators were only interested in keeping the peace.<br />They told us that love was a disease. They told us it would kill us in the end.<br />For the very first time I realize that this, too, might be a lie.'<br /><br />Delirium was a dystopian novel with an intriguing premise, beautiful writing style and a plot that will keep you engaged at all times. I really found this one of the best novels in this genre that I have read in a long time, and with such high expectations after seeing the reviews and having it recommended to me by a librarian I am both glad and relieved that these were well and truly met.<br /><br />Lena lives in a world where love is regarded as a disease. Dangerous. Forbidden. They call it 'deliria nervosa', and all people are 'cured' through surgery on their eighteenth birthday. It's a simple life, with everything mapped out for you after your Evaluation, where who you will marry being decided. However, Lena soon realises that there is more to life than this. When she meets Alex, a sympathiser, he brings out feelings in her that her society would never want her to experience. And with her best friend Hana already staying late after curfew and breaking the rules, Lena begins a journey of discovering what it means to love and be loved.<br /><br />The first thing I have to comment on here is the writing style. It swept me up from the very first page and ebbed along beautifully. I noticed in this book especially that Lauren Oliver used a lot of imagery in the form of similes and metaphors scattered throughout the book to accentuate the emotion in a society devoid of it. This was a major factor in the high rating I gave Delirium, because I feel that although the content itself and what the writer is saying is just as important as how they do it, through creative use of literary techniques. For this reason I found the novel easy to read and truly captivating. Each scene was described in the best way possible, to make it a joy for the reader to use their imaginations and have an immersing reading experience.<br /><br />'And now I know why they invented words for love, why they had to: it's the only thing that can come close to describing what I feel in the moment, the baffling mixture of pain and pleasure and joy, all running sharply through me at once.'<br /><br />The characterisation and development was another element which I found to be exquisitely done. The change for Lena was clear with her catalyst being Alex. Through him she learns more about herself and her family, and what it means to feel and to be truly happy. Love is proven to be a stronger force than duty, a message that rings more true here than ever. Although what society dictates may be what seems the 'right' way of living, with such constraints on the true aspects of being human and having that impenetrable bond it is no surprise that the notion of rebellion in some form would take shape.<br /><br />In this case it was not in the form of outward violence so much as a quieter revolution focusing on the three main characters of Lena, Hana and Alex. Apart from the romantic situation which was in itself well executed and not too cheesy or unrealistic, I found Lena and Hana's friendship was equally well developed. It was nice to see that the themes of friendship and loyalty had a role in the story as well as that of love. At times it seems in other novels where the couple becomes self-absorbed and without a care about anyone else. In this case it was good to see that Lena still had contact with her friend and the two stayed close, demonstrating what it means to have a true friend that will stick by you no matter what.<br /><br />*CONCLUSION*<br /><br />In conclusion, if you were a fan of the Matched series or are looking for a dystopian novel that will impress with its wonderful writing style, great characters and fantastic plot then Delirium is sure for you.ill impress with its wonderful writing style, great characters and fantastic plot then Delirium is sure for you.
0307744434|5.0|\\"The circus appears without warning...\\" If it is possible, I believe that I was swept into the world of The Night Circus almost that quickly, which isn't all that easy to do... I can't help but wish I could stay in this story longer, wander through every tent, peer into every corner of Le Cirque Des Reves... Even though I suppose that doing so would steal away from the wonderment of the whole thing. There are aspects of this story that are a true testament of the endless possibilities of imagination.<br />And while I can't imagine this being a novel for everyone, as it may lack some of the big flashy plot twisting moments... But if you want to find a world to fall into and stay awhile, this is a great place to land.
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|I saw this in the theater when in came out years ago.  We just watched it again with our kids.  Our 13 year old and 11 year old loved it. Our 7 year old thought the storm scene in the boat was too scary, and the plot was a little too complicated.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|When I first heard of this game my friend had it on the DS well she let me try it and it was awesome. Together we managed to finish the game but then she left and I never heard of it again........<br />Until today. I purchased it and it is brilliant. Even better than the Nintendo version by far I can tell you that. It is brilliant and amazing and a must get game. Beg your mom to get it. You won,t regret it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love the game. Very addicting and enjoyable. I got this free but I would have played for it. Have fun!
B0090P98Z4|3.0|I think this game is cool. I like being able to upgrade the weapons. it has pretty cool effects and you can control the player.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book offers a real and rare glimpse into the what the life after this life may entail.<br /><br />Even more important, it gives some excellent guidance on what we should really be concerned with in this life.<br /><br />The book is well written and very readable.<br /><br />My compliments and appreciation to the author.<br /><br />JR
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game for my 4 year old, but after watching him play, I started playing it and I love it! It's a great game for the family to enjoy taking turns playing. I still can't beat my son's high score!

B007HJ8LOE|5.0|I really enjoy this movie and have gone a few years without seeing it although I know I own it either in laserdisc or DVD but haven't pulled it out until seeing it was free to watch with Amazon Prime. I live the saga of the boy and his mentor going through the years and his interest in working in the projection booth of a small italian cinema.  They pass through many endearing moments together and his growing up through the help of this loving man.  I understand that a revised version is available with many cut scenes having been put back in make me anxious to re-purchase a revised version.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's a great product that works exactly as described.  Looking forward to support of more apps, and possibly local content.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|So, here is the second installment of the \\"rebooted\\" Star Trek series, again directed by J.J. Abrams. \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" is a big-budget action-packed adventure movie that is so fast-paced that you almost forget the storyline is full of plot holes. After all, this is a J.J. Abrams movie and how he re-imagined the universe of \\"Star Trek,\\" for better or worse. It was sort of refreshing in his previous effort back in 2009, with a new cast of players and Leonard Nimoy returning to the series, but this time the filmmakers went too far.<br /><br />Following the pre-main title action sequence (in a James Bond fashion, the main story begins as Chris Pine's Captain Kirk sets out to capture one John Harrison, a terrorist responsible for the bomb attack in London, now hiding in the Klingon home world.<br /><br />Whether or not you are an avid Star Trek fan, you will soon realize that this is a Hollywood-made sci-fi blockbuster action movie whose name happens to be \\"Star Trek,\\" in spite of the third act that has something to do with one \\"Star Trek\\" episode in the past.<br /><br />Among the film's cast including those who have returned to play the \\"Enterprise\\" crew, it is Benedict \\"Sherlock\\" Cumberbatch who leaves the most lasting impression as \\"John Harrison.\\" Of course he is not what he seems. Great as his performance is, however, the back story of Cumberbatch's character does not really convince.<br /><br />The film is a fun ride, to be sure, but not as much fun as the previous one. Slick and entertaining as it is, \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" looks more like an average sci-fi adventure movie that tries too hard to be \\"Star Trek.\\"
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The ONLY version I've heard was the Phil Spector version. Listening to this version, stripped of the symphony/orchestra treatment was like a breath of fresh air. Compare The Long and Winding Road against the 'original' and you'll be amazed. With this CD, bare is better.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I thought for sure that this book was going to be great.  My teenage daughter read through the entire series in a matter of days.  The writing style is what got me I guess.  You're going along reading and out of nowhere is a word that I have never even heard of!  I used the dictionary on my Kindle more than I ever have.  I am by no means a scholar, but I'm no stranger to the Sunday crosswords either and some of these words appeared to have been placed during the editing rather than the writing process.  The characters themselves seemed rather flat.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It doesn't happen often when I start a series, but I will not go further with this one.

B008LFY6NI|3.0|This is a very fun app. But the iPod version seems to have more features, and its the same price. I don't recommend buying the Kindle version, but I strongly recommend the iPod version.

B0089LOG02|5.0|This was an amazing story.  Showing the best and worst in people.  I really enjoyed it.  I highly recommend reading it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The story continues with all of the HOT sexy drama we expect from the first book, but the serious, criminal ending was an unexpected twist. Looking forward to the 3rd book.
B000O14VAU|5.0|The video has a great plot, good script, and good dialogue. Though a few things I saw could've been fixed. The graphics on the werewolves, good work, but needs more fur. There's this one scene where the black lycan was taking blades out of his shoulder, they made the mistake of putting the wound on the other side. They could have at least gave the werewolves tail, like in Howling.<br /><br />As for the video itself, anyone who knows Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet, two clans fight over a long feud. All because of passion and love, since both are undead creatures, they almost mirrored Romeo and Juliet. Only this time, out a twist of werewolves and vampires.<br /><br />Anyways, great story. This is my first time starting the series.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|I'm commenting on the series, not the product because the box set hasn't been released yet.<br /><br />WHO SHOULD WATCH BREAKING BAD?<br />I'm fifty-(ahem) years old and I've watched a lot of tv in my life.  In my opinion this stands out as the best of all the outstanding drama series from the 60's and beyond.  Were you a fan of \\"Hill Street Blues\\"?  How about St. Elsewhere, NYPD Blue and Law and Order?  Did you like the cop shows in the 70's?  Did you watch Homicide, LA Law, ER, 24 or CSI?  It follows the format of \\"The Fugitive\\" more than any I remember.  This drama has all the good stuff of those and then LEAPS into a level beyond in terms of drama, suspense, acting, writing, and production.  Every company who produces tv shows should have a shrine in honor of Breaking Bad.<br /><br />But, let me add:  If you're a bit squeamish, you may have to turn your head at times.<br /><br />A SHORT INTRO (no spoilers)<br />The setting is Albuquerque, NM and the series begins on Walter White's 50th birthday.  He's really a regular sort of guy.  A nerdy fellow who's afraid of his own shadow.  A family man.  A man with a mortgage and a job he's not really crazy about, because he is severely over qualified.  We would later learn that he was removed from his chosen enterprise in a political move, but brings his bagged lunch to his boring job every day in his AZTEC.  That's how bland he is.  He drives a Pontiac Aztec.  And, he also drives it to his crappy part time job.  His front yard is gravel.  They've got magnets on the refrigerator.  He's a guy who could be your next door neighbor, or your brother in law, or YOU.  Then, all of a sudden he's hit with adversity.  Inoperable lung cancer.  Walter is a very private, proud person and the apple of his eye really is his family whom he doesn't want to worry or be burdened with his care.  (remember that).  Walter begins to reflect on his life, his options and his response to the crummy hand he's been dealt.  He's not going to take this lying down.  He's determined not to leave his family in ruins, he's not going to die a schmuck and he's tired of being pushed around his whole life.  Then one day...<br /><br />WHY IT'S UNIQUE<br />The single most impressive factor is the first rate writing.  The script is a very clever, interwoven storyline with sharp turns and interesting characters.  The writers control just how much you know about a character until its time to let you know more.  The acting is top notch, but I think much of that may be due to the roles themselves.  Characters that you love, or hate or love to hate (or hate to admit that you love)<br /><br />Every episode begins with a short scene that is a flashback, or something that won't take place for some time.  Or something off to the side.  It doesn't make sense at that point, but it will fit into the larger puzzle later down the line.  The show doesn't always follow a linear timeline but it doesn't get mixed up enough to confuse you, just to tease you or keep you trying to figure out what's going to happen next.  There are plenty of times the plot takes an unexpected turn and sometimes you might be laughing, followed by a sudden, \\"Man, I cant believe they did that!!\\" 180 degree turn in the middle of traffic.<br /><br />And, if you appreciate good photography and music you will see that this series is at the top of the chart.  The Southwest U.S. cinematography and choice of music makes this a stunning masterpiece.  Story and acting aside, this is really something beautiful to look at.  Plus, it gets better each season.<br /><br />THE ONLY NEGATIVE<br />Another reviewer made this point and I have to agree.  Some of the events are kind of far fetched.  I mean the sun and moon and stars must all align in perfect harmony for it to happen, but c'mon.  Crazy things do happen.  And they all happen in the life and times of Walter White.  You should actively watch, but don't overthink it.  Just enjoy.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br />Watch the first episode.  Its called \\"Pilot\\".  The first few minutes won't make any sense cause it's a flash forward...and...Walter's in his underwear.  But don't let that concern you, it will make sense later.  Watch the entire episode and see if it's for you.  You can see it here: [[ASIN:B0012QTT4O Pilot]]<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br />Ordinary citizen.  Cancer.  Bad choices.  Consequences.st episode.

B005LAIIMG|5.0|This flick really went a different direction with zombies. As opposed to the boring &#34;We've got to barracade this house!&#34; story lines, I feel like this sorta went with, what would really happen. Brad pitt does a great job playing a character that, due to his career, has seen something and is sorta mute to the carnage going on around him, but not to the point where he's un-human. The action scenes are well done, and every now and then it throws a little suspense in. Very well done.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Easy to pick up and it feels like one of those games that is good for your brain.  A fun and relaxing came that still offers a gentle challenge.
B00023B1AS|5.0|Glad to find a collection of the video's I enjoyed so much from this band back in the days when MTV actually played music videos.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Terrific series with a great storyline! My only complaint is that I wish the season was longer!!! I highly recommend it!
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Because this movie was made by Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge, Australia, Romeo+Juliet), I had high expectations. And a lot of those expectations were met: beautiful cinematography, a good amount of music, a nice tragic love story, over-the-top but well-done drama. Unfortunately though, it got pretty slow towards the end, and the music wasn't nearly as integrated as it could (and I think should) have been.  I'm not sure an entire song was ever played through, and it wasn't nearly as important to the plot of the movie as it was, for example, in Moulin Rouge. I was disappointed. But as for the rest of the movie, the acting was great and the story was great, and there's not much more you need for a high rating from me.
0446580848|1.0|I purchased this book because it was written by Nelson DeMille. Huge mistake. It is not fast-paced at all. In my own opinion, it is excruciatingly slow.<br /><br />If you want to know about the culture of Yemen, then buy a different book. Although this book has been recently published, it takes place about 10 years ago. This is fortunate because it is outdated in the US of today.
0345803485|5.0|I read the first book of FSoG after hearing that Charlie Hunnam was cast. Very familiar with Charlie's work and imagined him and his voice throughout while reading.  Oh my!  The dialog, his voice, his facial expressions fit perfectly from lust to playful smiles and back to dangerous looks. Not familiar with sweet Dakota's work, thus making it perfect as Grey explores her innocent sensuality and reveals the woman and his redemption. Would rather the movie had a more surreal interpretation of the erotica rather than explicit and absolutely love Ana's Inner Goddess! She steals the show. lol  Off to read book 2.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing book, I wish it would never end so inspirational! I'm a bit like Auggie I wonder what he looks like? 😄
B007WOFXAO|5.0|The sound of these recordings is quite good.  This is laid back rock at its' best recorded so you can easily understand the lyrics.  In some ways, this set of albums is a throw back to the 1930s and early 1940s when it was normal to have a long instrumental prelude to the vocals.<br /><br />The acoustic sound of the instruments is refreshing.  No fuzz guitar or other electronic gagetetry, only enhanced acoustics.  Highly recommended.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Amazing I just love the way it is hands on teaching you how to play. Awesome graphics and love the different monster and abilities
B00F35BV64|4.0|OK look, the different telling of the Kahn story was imaginative and intriguing but the whole parallel in themes between Wrath of Kahn and Into Darkness with Kirk and Spock reversing roles was just disappointing - especially Kirk's \\"death\\" scene. Sorry, there are just some moments from the original series that shouldn't be messed with and that's one of them. If you're going to retell the Kahn story, then really retell it.<br /><br />Second, the fact that Kahn (and the ship) survived the explosion of not one or two but 72 photon torpedoes so that he could crash into Starfleet Headquarters, which he also survived, was too much. It was like Karl getting hung by the neck by a chain on the roof right before it blew up in Die Hard yet still somehow showing up on the street to shoot John.<br /><br />Redo the last 20 minutes and it's a great movie. Actually better than the first.

B00E9P959O|5.0|Holy cow this is a sweet miracle. What a refreshing sound brought to this 'comeback' album. Every song is improved and it's a thrill to discover so much I never could hear. What an amazing difference. Thanks to all involved and the fellas for pricing this at $9 with a free digital rip here on amazon. Don't hesitate - this is phenomenal.
B006S01GH2|5.0|. . . you will love &#34;Amelie&#34;'s storytelling style and color palette.  Not to mention Audrey Tautou is just so a-freakin'-dorable!  Even some of the. . . not-that-cute. . . characters get to fall in sparkly, spangly love.  Romances in general are usually the bottom of my list, but this was an exception. Himaruya's &#34;Big Brother France&#34; would be proud.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Not a bad game. Fun they are making me leave a review to unlock an extra picture so here I am leaving a review so it must be good enough to make me go out of my way
B0069JBKHI|4.0|Mostly works well, but when it doesn't you're left with &#34;Your babyphone is unavailable at the moment.&#34; on the desktop or &#34;Baby monitoring is disabled.&#34; on the iphone. and then that is that - no reason and no one to reach. Again, it mostly works and a reboot has so far taken care of the problems, but a hint as to what the problem is would be nice.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Easy to get right away how to play.  Lovely puzzles and backgrounds.  Intriguing game play and nicely scaled difficulty. No problems as far as I am concerned.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|after Paper towns I really did not want to start reading this one, but I was captivated from the very first page.<br />So much enjoyment from the book about<br />1.teenagers<br />2.Cancer<br />I was just overwhelmed with the idea, that the life consists of simple pleasures and you can never have enough of them, never mind how old or how ill you are.<br /><br />You will smile and laugh and cry.<br />You will feel the healthiest ever yet not even feeling that the characters are ill.
B00D6QUMWG|5.0|This is probably the most important cd Ms.Netrebko has recorded so far!!!  The pure sound of her voice,the coloration,the intelligent reading.The fact that for her first Verdi cd,she chose arias that aren't like other normally sung arias in a first cd(NO Aida,Ballo,Forza,etc)  Macbeth is an opera I never imagine Ms.Netrebko would do!!Her voice is so beautiful,in this case her voice is so beautiful it make's \\"Lady Macbeth\\" even more scary!!My ultimate aria for me was \\"Tu che le vanita\\"She told me the whole story,STUNNING!!!!Even voice from top to the lowest notes.You hear that new dark sound only Anna can make.......you know what?? JUST BUY IT AND LISTEN!!!! You're going to love it!!!
B001ANSS5K|2.0|I really did not understand the point  of writing this book-too pathetic and depressing and very American-teenager-going -crazy-orientated. Did not enjoy the bit of it.
B00028HBL6|5.0|Telling of the last days of the life of Jesus Christ (Jim Caviezel) leading up to his crucifiction on a Roman cross.  As we watch the lead-up to his death we see better days in flash-back.<br /><br />All the dialog is in the language of the day. A beating like no other. After a couple viewings it begins to be an unpleasant watch. A masterpiece of film making.
B009O2XY12|1.0|It was not what I thought it would be  I would not tell anyone to get it.  I actually deleted it
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|There is more to come (sorry & hallelujah). Everyone is alive still, except Hank and Walt.  Hank could be replaced by his superficial wife, but Walt could only be replaced by a miracle. Perhaps a ghost. (Or, maybe he's scratching his way out of the coffin.) Once Saul (Esquire) has been followed through AMC before he met them, it will jump to Jesse Pinkman driving off, free to have a relationship with the gorgeous Skyler (I love her beautiful lips,) Walt Jr (equally as handsome), or Hank's wife, who is pretty, but a real pain.
B000059XUI|5.0|Got it and was in excellent condition. I got it for my little brother for his birthday and he is going to love it!!
0061906220|5.0|My daughter started reading this at 20 months old and nailed these colors within a week.  She absolutely adores pete the cat and loves screaming the color when asked what color his shoes are now.  Since reading it, she points out everyday objects and tells me what color they are.  The colors explored in the book are white, red, blue, and brown but also have yellow and green shoes inside the front and back covers.  It incorporates many different items through text and illustration - guitars, cars, umbrellas, coffee, mud, trees, rain, blueberries, strawberries, etc.  My daughter reads aloud with me, especially the &#34;oh no!&#34;  She tries to read this every night!
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|Got the package and was in mint condition. I can't wait to watch it again and catch up on the episodes I missed!! It truly is a great show and the actor who they chose to play Hannibal, truly is great and makes the character even more creepy.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like this alarm very much.  I have tried several and this one rates as the best.  I'm glad I downloaded it.
B009MO5ES8|5.0|I bought this movie because I like JGL. He did not disappoint in the movie. The special effects are really good as well.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|If bb wouldnt have made me start all over i would have giving 5 stars was lvl 88 3weeks ago and they finally contacted me back and said to log in to fb and recovery..grrrr to u but love this now and now im up to lvl 72
B00CL8D83U|5.0|I have been a PSB fan for a very long time but I must say this album is one of my favorites they have produced.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Keeps you interested and wanting to know what will happen next. A very suspenseful and funny book. The wish list was great.
B00BMYHU7Y|5.0|They got here on time, opened the package. Everything was wrapped up nice and tight. I could tell the box got banged up a bit, because on each one of the books there's a tiny dent in each corner, but nothing bad! I opened the books and flipped through the pages, making sure the print was all lined up at the bottom, all was good! Going to start reading book two, since I've read book one online. Five stars!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|In the new update I can't really go to my subscriptions by clicking channels. It's hard to get used to but now search is easier
B000VI70WM|4.0|When I heard that DD was teaming up with JT & Timbaland, I thought oh great, this is not going to be good and did not even bother with it when it came out. All Timbaland's songs sound exactly the same, and I didn't want it to ruin what I thought about one of my favorite bands of all time. I eventually heard a couple of the songs from the album after reading several reviews on this site, and it seemed that there was actually some good songs, and I ended up purchasing the CD. The title track and \\"The Valley\\" both have a club sound, and there are also some really pretty songs here, including \\"Falling Down\\", \\"She's Too Much\\", and \\"Box Full O'Honey\\" (which is a nice acoustical song) The worst songs are \\"Nite Runner\\" & \\"Skin Divers\\", and I think it's because they both sound too much like they belong on a Timbaland record \\"featuring Duran Duran\\". I wish I would have downloaded the whole album instead, so I could get the bonus track \\"Cry, Baby Cry\\", but I like having an actual copy of all DD's music. I know a lot of people wish DD still sounded like they did back in the day, but I like that they have been able to experiment with their music and grow as artists. I haven't liked everything they have done, but I would recommend fans give this one a chance, they may end up surprised like I did.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I can't wait to see the movie.  I'm hoping Jace & Clary figure out how to save their world.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I was wondering during this read why the majority of authors during the time this book was written wanted to be philosophers, because that was what it was like reading this book. Everything was about the philosophy of the soul. If you feel like reading a book that questions morals and the corruption of life this is your book. It is kind of long winded though and the ending is very sudden.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book covers so many things in a short number of pages. It shows so many parts of growing up. It doesn't hold back. It is a great read. Everyone who has gone through high school should read this book.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The book was really good, well written and addictive.<br />Cassandra Clare did it again! No wonder this series has been the number one best selling book for two years straight.<br />I really enjoyed it the characters were like able, and very few weren't but it made the book better.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is an awesome rpg for the kindle, absolutely addicting. A must get game for the avid gamer. Can't put it down
B00594XOZU|2.0|It won't let me log in. It loads fir a long time the it says something like .errior try again later. And it still don't work.
0316056898|4.0|Is she the smartest person in the room? Might be. A fine, laugh out loud book. Going on a cruise, don't read this before you do, but after, oh, yeah. Growing up funny. Our good luck.
B009PLKPMS|5.0|My CD arrived ontime, undamaged, and in brand new condition. I was so happy when I opened it, I'm not gonna lie I screamed for a minute...or two. I played it and there's no skips, scratches, or anything. I would recommend anyone McFlyer, or anyone who appreciates good music to buy this CD. It chronicles the ten year musical journey of a truly amazing band, and I aboslutely love it!
1476727651|5.0|Sometimes it takes an effort to get into the author's books. Not this time, it felt comfortable. An examination of places the author has found himself and how to save yourself. An echo of his times. A great quote about old injuries, that the reader knows the author has experienced.<br />When places down the road, Sturbridge, are mentioned, it's always fun. An author at the top of his game, returning to themes from his past. Very well done.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It was a simple but complex game that requires more than below average intelligence me personally thought it was a good game
B00F4PVFE6|5.0|A wonderfully suspenseful murder mystery set in a small British seaside community. Each episode provides building suspense and the plot turns and surprises are so well set up that the viewer is hooked from the very first. Superb acting from the entire cast and the writing and screenplay is crisp and realistic with not a single moment of cheesiness included. Really excellent TV- 8 engaging episodes in the series. David Tennant is wonderful as is Olivia Colman as the lead investigators. I loved this show and highly recommend it.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|This movie kept you riveted and at the edge of your seat the whole time. It was interesting because it actually had something to do with a fear people have been talking about at this time, something people are preparing for (which I find absolutely insane). It is difficult to say with a straight face but it is true, but believe it or not there are people preparing for this now.<br />To actually see how something like this could happen was remarkable. I could watch this time and time again. I have recommended this film to many of my friends
159420411X|5.0|Though known for the stunning accuracy of his political predictions in the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections, Nate Silver, in his fascinating \\"The Signal And The Noise,\\" goes beyond politics, and,  more interestingly, explains the inherent fallacies in our predictions. With wit, insight and most importantly, data, he debunks,  with clarity, earthquake prognosticators, weather and economic forecasts, the political pundits on the McLaughlin Group by laying a convincing foundation for human skepticism about the data and predictions which pass for gospel in this 21st century world.<br /><br />Unlike any political book you have read as it is not about politics which seems \\"small beer\\" to Silver, it is about our ingrained biases in making astute analyses and probability assessments on every thing from the run up to September 11, 2001, Cleveland Cavalier and Los Angeles Lakers basketball betting, baseball statistics, chess, poker, GDP growth, economic statistics,  and a slew of other earth shattering prognostications like the fielding process of \\"Derek Jeter versus Ossie Smith.\\"  As he sums it up at the end, this is more than what we know than \\"the difference of what we know and what we think we know.\\"  This is a serious, important book to read and reread and think about the \\"signal\\" behind our media \\"noise,\\" regardless of party or political persuasion.
B00DP3IESY|3.0|When you need to watch a movie a couple of times to figure it out it's not all that good; and 100 clones of Tom Cruise does not give a movie extra stars it rather brings a movie down a bit in ratings.<br />Who wrote this thing????
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Ms. Boyle will always get five stars from me. Her voice is pure with no gimmicks, just lovely to listen to, especially on this CD. Her pairing up with Donny Osmond is beautifully done and every track is exceptional.
B00CDCLL1A|3.0|This movie jumped around too much and did not allow the viewer to get to know the characters very well due to the jumping around and back and forth in time. Who were the characters, how they were related to each other, how did one character intersect another character's life??<br />You had to have a good and quick memory to keep up with everything going on in this movie.<br />I don't have a good short term memory so I found it hard to keep up with this movie.
B0012QRPU4|1.0|THIS IS A CENSORED VERSION--AMAZON DARES TO MESS WITH THE CREATORS' ARTISTRY.  BOYCOTT AMAZON VIDEO.  HOW DARE THEY?  WATCH IT ON DEMAND, OR BETTER YET, ON DVD.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I was entertained most of the movie, great stars taking on roles that don't push the envelope but is entertaining. Will see Red2.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very well put together game. I like the controls and the actions are smooth. Very entertaining! I would love a follow-up game from these guys.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Wow, this was so much better than the Sly's POC movie.  Enjoyed the fights and the story as it was told here.  Much closer to the comic.  Visually very cool.
0739375970|5.0|Epic!  Mr. Martin does a beautiful job with this book.  I have listened to books 3, 4 and 5 and in all, Mr. Dotrice does an excellent job narrating.  The way he narrates aids listeners feel every emotion, wound, danger, twist and battle scene as if you are watching the series on HBO.  I can wait till the next one comes out and I hope Mr. Dotrice narrates it as well.  I you have heard all the talk about this series and books, get into them, you will love them.  I do recommend to start with the books or the audio books as they definitely do not spare any details as the HBO series does.<br /><br />Go, what are you waiting for!
B00C1LIYWM|4.0|Great Date night movie. It takes you until almost the end to figure out what is really going on. I will watch this movie over and over again.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I was somewhat sceptical that I would enjoy this app but I am officially hooked.  Can't tear myself away.  You are presented with a grid of tiles (smallest grid is 5 x 5 and that's all I've done so far). Using the number clues on the top and side of the grid you must determine which tiles.are filled in and which tiles are left empty, and thus solve the puzzle I am sure the larger grids will be more challenging but for now I am enjoying the game. Try it; you'll like it.
B00BGICG5W|5.0|This is one of those films that you can watch over and over again and still roll around with laughter
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I believe this is user error.  For whatever reason, I simply couldn't get it to work properly.  I'm sure others won't have this same problem.
B0091W4PRC|5.0|This is one of my favorite films and makes me weep every time. Great story and the fact that it is based on a true story is inspiring
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app works great. Easy to use and install. Works better than the alarm clock that came with my phone. Would recommend any day.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|As a Boy I Tried to Imagine what terrors bomber and fighter flight crews experienced.  As a young Crew Chief sitting in the claustrophobic confines of B-52 bomber in the peaceful mid 70`s I shuddered at what it might have been like trapped inside that aluminum coffin as shells and shrapnel ripped through the thin walls.  As a licensed pilot I tried to Imagine the fear of falling from the sky behind enemy lines or over the freezing Atlantic ocean.  \\"A Higher Call\\" has answered all those questions while revealing the human goodness that struggles too exist within us all. Nothing is truer than the closing words of the book. \\"Enemies are better off as friends\\".  My new favorite book. 5++ stars.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I enjoyed the complexity, layers and character development in this book. It reminded me of the creative writing and storytelling in Cloud Atlas and The Book Thief. For me, I give it five stars; however, I don't think everyone is going to like this the story and the imaginative writing style. I also find the timing of reading this book to be coincidental to the current military muscle flexing occurring by North Korea. Some histories continue to repeat themselves.
B008Y212PI|5.0|great graphics. nice music and satisfying game sounds make this puzzeler a great way to spend the evening. addicting and complex puzzles to keep your interest.  lovely backgrounds. great tutorial.<br /><br />what can I say.... I love this app.  well done developers.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This non-fiction book on life in North Korea is perfectly aligned with The Orphan Master's Son. A historical account of life in North Korea since the Korean War, the failure of communism, and the past and current tragedy imposed on the North Koreans by their leaders.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The My Horse game is awesome you get to feed your horse,you get to enter your horse into competitions, you have to take care of your horse.You get to pick what you and your horses wear to the competitions.You also have to make sure your horse is healthy before you enter any competitions.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very well written, thought provoking story. Excellent for book group discussions. I continue to think about the story, its layers and issues for days since completing the book. Very strong character and plot development. Tackles some tough social questions of our times.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a great book!  This book makes you forget about the things you may be worrying about and be grateful for what you have.  A must read for ALL.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I can't stop playing this game.  I can't wait to see the next pix unfold.The graphics are beautiful. It's like you are standing in the middle of the scene.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This book is well written and keeps your interest. There are a lot of characters and you aren't sure which ones you should remember and which are just passing through the book. Over all, it is a great read and I cannot wait to read the third book...wish there were more
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's an awesome great entertaining game. It takes awhile to build up but once you get it going it's not too bad
B0016KJKIG|5.0|Nice nylon sheath with strong velcrow this one is a large one so my leatherman surge fits in it nicely. It replaces a worn out leather one I carried for about 4 years.

B008Y212PI|5.0|Good times had by all. Three different settings makes it a great game for any age. Addicting and fun. Give it a try.
B008Y212PI|3.0|It was fun for awhile but I quickly moved through all the puzzles. The puzzles seemed rather easy. I would not pay $1.99 for this game, but as a FAOTD it is not bad. Cross Me is definitely a better game and the free version has more puzzles than this paid app.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|As in the title, Castle is a funny, light-hearted crime show that is a good alternative to all the more serious crime series out there. The characters all have unique personalities and play off each other well. Well done series!
142312166X|5.0|I loved that this story went into the hidden gems of camp half-blood. The stories were upbeat and well laid out and brought the classic Percy humor into play.  I look forward to many more excerpts from the world of Percy.
B00EP22QKG|5.0|It is so nice to hear some new Joan. In an age of Autotune and over-processed pop princesses, Joan is, was, and will remain a source and example for female musicians to follow. The songs are tight and could be blaring from your cassette deck in your Trans Am while cruising the strip. In other words...this is vintage.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Decent enough little game. Could be longer ... wish I hadn't typed my original review in the title bar... it was better than this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fab game would recommend it for adults and kids.lots of fun for whole family. Great that you get to train your horse.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|This game is awesome! I have spent many hours playing it after downloading. Still haven't grown tired of it, because of the diverse levels: hidden objects (with words, images and jumbled words), match-3, home decoration (optional). Zoom makes it possible to search for tinier objects if need be. Good response to touch. I'm a fan!
B008220DGE|1.0|Sixties surrealistic drug flick taking place in the fifties, as directed by Salvador Dali. Couldn't have cared less about any of the characters. Tried to force myself through it just to be objective.<br /><br />Didn't care. Joaquin Phoenix's character is blunt, embarrassing. Looks like he sort of wandered in, doesn't know why he's there in the first place. Drinks anything and everything.<br /><br />Hoffman mumbles like an animated English sheepdog, talks about all sorts of random, different things and feels like a drunk Charlie Chaplin character with a perpetually florid face.<br /><br />The script sounds like it was written by an over-enthusiastic cubicle drone with too much time on his hands and an overinflated sense of Deathless Important Angst-Ridden Pomposity. Everything you see drives home just how hopeless, degenerate, shallow and ridiculous everyone and everything is. The soldiers are promiscuous, sex-starved freaks who in reality would get their @$$es kicked by their COs, department store workers are so flat and dull they're likely to suck the life right out of you - when they're not humping each other and poisoning themselves. For all that the film purports to be focused on redemption, it drives home how worthless and pointless people are.<br /><br />The interview in the first hour between Hoffman's character and a reporter had me somewhat listlessly amused. It sounds like a carefully prepped propaganda argument against religion out of today's news but this time, it doesn't end with the person 'reasonably, rationally, questioning' religion turning beet-red in the face and screaming like a loony. See BBC for appalling reference. The 'Reporter of Sterling Virtue' is calm, suave and erudite, ever-so-reasonable and 'concerned' for the public good. He comes off like a gollygeegosh cardboard cutout from the same era as the movie. One moment of humor in the first hour.<br /><br />Much as I hate to bring the word up again, this movie is pretty hollow propaganda.<br /><br />Will watch this when I feel the need to bore myself to death. Got through one hour and I can't focus my eyes.<br /><br />Won't be a popular opinion, but that's mine.r /><br />Will watch this when I feel the need to bore myself to death.

B009GEYX5E|4.0|I don't have any complaints since I've only used the film once so far. But I like the photo I took. The color is either hit or miss, to my memory that's the way polaroid film has always been... you never really knew what you were going to get. A fuzzy image, slightly odd coloring - that's part of the fun. :0)
B008476HBM|4.0|To be truthful I originally downloaded book onto kindle just to try out my new Kindle however once I started reading it compelled me to keep going to find out the fate of the sisters.  Not an easy read but well worth the effort.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This is one of the best phone-scanning apps I've ever seen. It is very easy to capture, crop and save your files, as well as export them. I have used this in multiple situations: sharing recipes from books, making copies of a document for the purpose of group studies, etc. Very fast and very efficient, I have nothing bad to say about this app!
0345511468|5.0|The Making of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi by J.W. Rinzler is truly an impressive book to behold. Within the 372 pages, the story of how Return of the Jedi was made is fully laid out in a wonderful format that's thoroughly engaging. The book covers the entire process, from securing the funding for preproduction to the response of critics and fans after its release. There are summaries and passages from the early drafts of the scripts, behind the scenes stories from the actors and special effects artists, and a wide array of pictures and concept art throughout the book. If you're a fan of the films, this is definitely a must read.<br /><br />As a long time fan of Star Wars, I found this book to be very surprising. I haven't read the other books in the `Making of' series, so this was my first exposure to J.W. Rinzler's chronicling of the films. With non-fiction books like this, it can be hit and miss with the subject matter. Sometimes it can be too dry and weighed down with facts. In The Making of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, that doesn't happen. Every paragraph in the book has some fun factoid that keeps things interesting. There was a ton of information I did not know. For instance, ROTJ producer Howard Kazanjian was second assistant director to one of my favorite westerns The Wild Bunch. Another fun aside was that the idea for the Ewoks (initially called Ewaks) was born from George Lucas' work on Apocalypse Now and his desire to have primitives defeating a technologically advanced force. In fact the core idea for ROTJ was based on that with Jabba, Tatooine and Han all being afterthoughts. Other cool notes were presented in early drafts of the script where Obi-Wan and Yoda don't come back as Force ghosts but actually come back to life fully in the flesh. One of my favorite discoveries in the book was the naming of Salacious Crumb, the little monkey creature in Jabba's palace that hackles and laughs. One night creature designer Phil Tippett had one too many pints of beer and said, \\"Wait a minute guys while I tie my soolacious.\\" Those who heard that loved it, and thus Salacious got his first name. George added the Crumb after adult comic book artist Robert Crumb. Throughout the book there is an endless array of information, from the intriguing to the hilarious.<br /><br />Beyond fun facts, the book also covers aspects that fans may never have thought about before. Things like keeping ILM alive between Star Wars sequels, their work on E.T., Dragonslayer and Poltergeist, and George's work creating a Star Wars film in between Indiana Jones movies. I thought it was interesting that the Director's Guild took George Lucas to court over the credits in The Empire Strikes Back. They felt that the appearance of \\"Lucasfilm\\" in the credits, which popped up before Kershner, was like giving George credit over the director, thus they wanted to fine him. Then there was the drawn-out negotiations with Fox for the rights of the movies. The behind the scenes details expanded my knowledge of the film in ways I never perceived before. It's like exploring the movie on a whole new level.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes in the book is by ILM general manager Tom Smith.<br /><br />We had developed the best talent, built up and tested the most powerful tools of the day, and every Academy Awards season we had won the Oscar for visual effects. We were the best in the world when George brought us Jedi.<br /><br />There were so many talented people who worked on Return of the Jedi. In this book, Rinzler manages to cover quite a few of them, bringing them to the reader's eye, and expressing their role in the film and the nature of their personalities. It was through the work of all of those people that the movie was able to be made. And while there was some criticism of the film, which the book does cover, it was still positively received by the majority of fans and went on to break several box office records.<br /><br />The bottom line is that The Making of Return of the Jedi is the ultimate book on the story behind the film. Anyone who wants to know what went on to make the movie, what went on behind the scenes, and what could have been and almost was, well...this is the book to read to find out. It's jam packed with information from cover to cover and filled with great illustrations, pictures and concept art. There are numerous quotes from George Lucas, the actors and the crew, there are tons of fun stories that happened on set, and there is a lot of insight on every facet of the film. There is only one bad thing about the book, and that's its size. It's a big book, and in hardcover, it's heavy, so trying to find a comfortable position to read it can be an never ending task. However, the size is worth it as it covers every scope of the film. Plus the hardcover binding is really nice. Though if you have a full color eReader, it may be worth getting the enhanced digital version, especially with all the bonus features it comes with. Either way, this is a book you don't want to miss out on.<br /><br />I give The Making of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi a five out of five. In fact I liked the book so much that I'm now going to pick up the rest of the `Making of' series and I'm giving some serious consideration to J.W. Rinzer's The Complete Making of Indiana Jones.ing of Return of the Jedi is the ultimate book on the story behind the film.

However, the size is worth it as it covers every scope of the film. Plus the hardcover binding is really nice. Though if you have a full color eReader, it may be worth getting the enhanced digital version, especially with all the bonus features it comes with. Either way, this is a book you don't want to miss out on.<br /><br />I give The Making of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi a five out of five. In fact I liked the book so much that I'm now going to pick up the rest of the `Making of' series and I'm giving some serious consideration to J.W. Rinzer's The Complete Making of Indiana Jones.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it us always fun to put yourself in another's shoes. There are so many scenarios and possibilities.<br />I recommend this book for moms that have school aged children. It really outs those, well now I cry every time I hear a story like that :)
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a cute little game. I enjoyed playing it. It could use more boards but you could probably just replay them.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I love Bones.... i do.... and OMG! Chapter 32, i think it was, but oh my god... simply *sigh*.... there are no words, just feelings!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This program is an excellent way to learn a new language, or brush up on one from long ago. The process is fun, and the in game awards make it motivating to continue learning. I use it on my phone and computer, and love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It's really good, and a good way to keep someone  busy for  awhile if there getting on your nerves! XD
B008Y212PI|5.0|I've been playing this game all day.  The different size grids let you progress to more difficult puzzles.  I wish there were new pictures for the larger grids.  Instead, they reuse the same pictures and just increase the grid size.  Also, I found myself moving too quickly at times and accidentally selecting paint instead of clear. Maybe those buttons could be separated a bit and not right next to each other.  Although I got this for free, I would probably have paid a dollar for it.
B00CR1DX9A|5.0|What a great surprise to finally get around to reading this book, and discovering a gem! This is a very funny, tongue-in-cheek look at modern England, with jokes and sarcasm scattered throughout. I enjoyed it very much.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|Saw the \\"We're the Millers\\", \\"lucky seven times\\"!!!!!And when I found out the DVD will be on pre-order, I ordered my copy on August 30th 2013. And I would love \\"We're the Millers\\", win' GOLDEN GLOBES'( 71st Annual Golden Globes Awards on Sunday, January 12th, 2014 on NBC) for Best Comedy Movie in 2013!And would love to have Jennifer Aniston win Best Actress in a Comedy and Jason Sudeikis win Best Actor in a Comedy!!!The whole cast is great!Thank you to the crew.Available on Tuesday,November 19,2013!!!!!!
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Beautiful figure!  Looks just like Sailor Moon.<br /><br />At first I had trouble taking the face and hair off, because the instructions were in Japanese.  But I followed the picture and it just pops right off when you pull away from the body.  Taking it off the first time was the most difficult, but after that they slide right into place without a problem.<br /><br />The crying face and winking face are my favorite.  I like that they included both Moon Healing Escalation sticks (one with the Silver Crystal, one without).  The Moon Tiara Action disc is cool as well.<br /><br />The tiny detail put into the figure is stunning.  She's very posable and it's fun putting her in classic poses.<br /><br />The only thing I would change about it is that I wish it was bigger overall, especially for the expensive price.  The pieces are tiny and sometimes difficult if you have big hands.  But nonetheless, I love it and definitely recommend it to every Sailor Moon fan.  You won't be disappointed :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I began this story feeling a tad apprehensive...I assumed it would be much like other 'sequels'.  I've never been more wrong.  I simply couldn't stop reading it.  I'm just as impressed with Doctor Sleep as I was the first time I read The Shining.  My only complaint is that it had to come to an end!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's a very engaging show without stooping to raunchiness or shock to keep the viewer interested.  The story and the characters make the show as wonderful as it is.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Interesting and challenging.  You find time has just flown by while you played.  I would love lots more pictures. Makes you think while you have fun.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I am VERY PLEASED with this app I downloaded on my Kindle fire.  This game/puzzle is very well created.  I had NO problems with it working or downloading.  Graphics are fine.  Tutoral is very easy to understand.  This game/puzzle makes you think and works your mind.  One person can play it and you don't have to depend on other folks interaction.  It even has a button for when you get stuck so you can continue to play it.  It has also been very additive so far  :)<br />GREAT JOB!!!!  I love it!!!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is another excellent exploratory CD but I would like to see Josh explore more of the classical crossover pieces. He has to go back to explore more opportunities to explore his deeper, booming, rich voice. I still recommend this CD and for everyone to sample Josh's talent!
B000025ABR|5.0|This CD showcases more of Celine's versatility as a singer. Nice melodies and Celine shows some of her vocal range. I highly recommend this CD!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mincraft because it has really nice details and the graphics are amazing.Plus the moving sun and moon is a good update.But I think there should be flint and steel in creative and Tnt blows up in creative.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great sequel to hunger games! If you want more great reads on the first  book in the series then pick up this book.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It was a really good book if you like a good vampire book then read twilight you will really enjoy it!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This book was so insightful and emotional. You'd think a lot of the detail would be lost in translation, but this was spot on. Heartbreaking and eye-opening stories about the holocaust. Recommend that everyone reads it.
1931559317|5.0|This is a handy and well organized sky atlas, The pages are semi-waterproof but I found that they will warp a bit if you leave it outside and open all night in heavy dew. Best to keep it closed or put away dry after a night of viewing.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie was excellent! Shame on people for prejudices! This movie was so true to life yet so entertaining at the same time.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|The DVD is in excellent condition.  I would recommend this movie and will watch it again and again.  Loved it.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Not often does the viewer get to see the other side of the coin in war movies involving the Japanese foe, until now. This one does a nice job of letting the viewer see what the Japanese endured during World War II. It is nice to see that they weren't as well treated as  one might think. Japan didn't treat their servicemen as royalty, even though they expected these same people to die by suicide if necessary in service of their Emperor.<br />Overall, this is a well done film that is both action oriented and touching. I have no hesitation in recommending it to others and view it from time to time.
0525425772|2.0|I believe it should be advertised as a children's book.  It wasn't what I expected.  I'm glad I just ordered one to start with.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is probably my 10th time watching this movie.  I simply love it.  I am a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence and think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to her work.  Love the cast.  Everyone fit in their part.  I think it is a movie to show young girls and old what it is like to be a warrior woman.  To embrace your who you are and to simply be true to yourself.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This series continues to be great despite the cast changes. Joe Montegna is better than Mandy Patinkin ever was.  This season kept me interested up until the final cliffhanger.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I love the TV show, but the book is even better...so much more detail!  Things they had to leave out.  A must-read (or listen to if you get the Audio version)
B00701QVVY|5.0|Incredible metal assault! Still one of the best! The album shows that Overkill have stood the test of time and have maintained their integrity while grinding out fresh music.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|I've been using this macro converter for over 2 years & get fantastic results. Probably around 90% of my photography is macro, & I regularly get complimented on my images. I use Lumix point & shoots (currently FZ200) & with this converter I get results equivalent to a macro lens many times the cost. My only slight issue is that the plastic holder that attaches the lens to the camera is a bit cheap & flimsy, in fact that is the reason for this purchase - my previous DCR-250 pinged off one to many times & got scratched up. Other than that - great product!
1476734941|5.0|I saw a 1-hour PBS documentary about this British guy (Michael Mosley) who ate whatever he wanted 5 days out of the week and fasted for 2. He lost a lot of weight and according to his Physician, he was MUCH healthier overall. This book goes into more detail behind the science. But, to make a long story short, I have been on this diet for 3.5 weeks and lost 13 lbs. seriously, at least look into, &#34;The Fast Diet&#34; to learn more. It's pretty revolutionary as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />P.S. - PBS wanted a $100 dollar donation for this book whereas I was able to find it on Amazon more than 80% cheaper...and that was in NEW condition....probably even cheaper if you buy USED.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|&#34;My alarm clock&#34; is my fovorite app.  Quick to find time.  Alarm clock is always available with the ability to set several wake-up or reminder calls at the same time.  It is best if plugged in to make sure batter doesn't go dead before alarm setting.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great actors, great performances, and the ending was a total surprise. The clues were there, but we never guessed the murderer.
B00280LYIC|3.0|In this young adult novel twelve-year-old misfit student Percy learns that he is an immortal, or at least a demi-god. This is the year that Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor becomes a senior citizen. If he manages to outlive his mother Elizabeth Alexandra Mary now 87 whose mother lived to 102 he will become king or failing that his son William Philip Arthur Louis age 31. Now imagine that you are the offspring of Zeus or Jupiter. These Greek or Roman Gods are immortal. As such succession is an impossibility. What's a bored immortal godling to do? Hanky panky with humans is one possible amusement; hence we have Percy. Quite a mouthful to swallow just after escaping the horns of the Minotaur. Now imagine Mount Olympus on Long Island.<br /><br />Restored and healed by water and having an ability for sword-play he had no idea he possessed Perseus, Lightning Thief is sent on a quest. If you think these kids get into a great deal of trouble along the way remember these are twelve-year-olds out on their own. Their curiosity and sense of adventure keep them constantly in hot water. Not a great book but moderately interesting if for nothing else it's treatment of Greek Myth.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Great album! I can't wait to go to the Hail to the king tour in october and I can't stop listening to it in the car.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I am no literary agent or professional, but as a normal everyday reader I enjoyed the journey this book took me on.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I have to admit I am not a Trekke at all but these new ones are great. They have a sense of humor to them and actors are great
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I've read this 3 times already (and I'm not a big fan of reading) I can't wait to see where the next book takes Gideon and Eva!
B000EYK4KI|3.0|A bunch of beautiful people running around shooting at each other...it's like Baywatch with guns.  I will credit Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for their excellent chemistry...which is probably what led to all those speculations about when their relationship started (not sold either way on that arguement, by the way).  As far as action thrillers go, this is above average.  But ultimately, it is really just beautiful people running around with guns, trying to kill each other...hope the beauty pageant contestants don't get ideas from this.  If you wanna watch the alledged beginnings of Brangelina, don't let me stop you.  But at least listen to this bit of advice...if you're buying the film, get the unrated version...there's a reason these kinds of versions exist.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Ok but there is a problem when I have to update every time the change the theme.<br />I think it's just stupid.
B000059TPN|5.0|This film is living proof that action movies once had a decent plotline and it wasn't all about the special effects...we've currently got our Hollywood studios locked in their own little arms race going on in that department.  Yes, there were special effects, but there was also genuine acting (an oxymoron, I know) and real scenery...I mean, this film was mostly shot on the actual Alcatraz Island out in California...so a few things about the place were made up...it's called \\"creative liberties\\".  Anyway, the unlikely pairing of Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage proved sound once Cage's character mellowed out from the \\"Gee Wiz\\" type of nerd he came into this film as (talk about elavating your character).  I thought the nerdy persona was over-emphasized in the beginning and was glad to see it go...I first began liking Mr. Cage in this film when he explained what the poison gas stolen by the bad guys could do.  Ed Harris was great as their opposite and the writing made him into a compelling and somewhat sympathetic villain.  John Spencer was wonderfully dispikible as the scheming FBI Director and Sean Connery seemed to agree with me as he hung the man over a hotel balcony, probably intending to drop him to his death...this was also actually shot out in San Fransisco...no CGI...people actually called 9-1-1 about it because they didn't realize that a movie was being filmed.  Overall, this was a great film with great casting, great directing, great editing, and most importantly, a great plot.  It's an action film that so many action films today should try to live up to.  Enjoy it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very fun and entertaining. Would like better if you got more tokens starting out. But overall it is fun a lot like temple run an bear grille game.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|FUN AND EASY TO PLAY some are challingin I have spent many many hours playing this game. You will enjoy as much as I did.  HAVE. FUN.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|I really liked this book because of the intense action and excitement! I would definitely recommend this book for kids of all ages. These reasons are also why I love the Alex Rider series so much! It's a shame that there won't be anymore Alex Rider series coming, but I pre- ordered Russian Roullette, an  started reading it! !_!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I remembered this & it's over4all excellent showing. I could only find it to buy & was thoroughly rewarded. It is not a happy show ,but a great one!
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|To the reviewer who said this album wasn't as good as Drake's last, YOU MUST BE DEAF OR HAVE NO SENSE OF KNOWING GOOD MUSIC, this album blows Take Care away 10X, I can't stop listening to it, Drizzy said he would give the listener a different vibe, and boy did he not disappoint....
B005LAII4E|5.0|Have been waiting on release of GI Joe the second movie since after seeing the first one. Knew that they would make another. Great Cast.
B000000OYQ|5.0|Jimmy Page is always amazing.  Love this CD and have had hours of entertainment from it.<br />Any one who buys this will not be dissappointed.  such a talented artist with wonderful ideas<br />and the know-how to mix sounds that please the ear and soul.
B00BQ1D7BQ|3.0|A lot of hype for nothing special. Sounds like the tired old man who hangs around my friend's studio. Musings without direction.
B00004U45G|5.0|You just can't go wrong here!  This is music that will make you feel good.  What a great<br />mix this was.  Jimmy Page is such a great entertainer and never disappoints. Love the<br />Black Crowes also and the music put together here is so good.  ENJOY
0321934318|5.0|If you are new to Lightroom 5 or any other Lightroom program, this book will help you do things that you would not have been able to do in the time it takes to learn the program. Sure you can stumble through Lightroom but with this book, Scott Kelby makes learning Lightroom 5 a breeze & in a very fast amount of time, you will be using the techniques taught to add that look you are trying to achieve!
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Awesome!! I was live in the Golden Triangle! As for the concert in general 5 star. Just waiting for the new bluray version to come out that will fix the current sound on the first press.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I read all five books in the series.  The first episode stays very close to the book's story line. I enjoyed the imagery from the studio and video crew,
0345530578|5.0|Always a fun run with John Grisham novels.  A good airplane read.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it immensely.
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|I downloaded it for my boys and it wouldn't download ....after an hour or longer it said my nook color can't play this game!!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|What a joy . To share this game with my puzzle addicted family and friend. I don't mind  the occasional easy as pie picture  it gives a boost to my younger grandchildren they get so excited  when they are able to predict accurately . And the smiles and squeals  are worth every  minute spent watching and encouraging. Them to think and think some more. I love this game
1423136802|5.0|I loved these books so much!  Rick Riordan is an amazing author, and the consistency in the books with greek mythology is amazing.  I love the action, adventure, comedy, and romance!  One of my favorite series even though it is geared toward children and young adults.  Love!
B000002O4X|5.0|Love the movie, and absolutely love the music, previous disc was ruined and just had to get another original soundtrack.
1781162646|3.0|It is  a Steven King book!  What more is there to say.  Haven't read it yet, am looking forward to it!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual,I didn't want it to end! Phenomenal book, love  it !!! Stephen King is my favorite author, his stories make me laugh....cry and every emotion in between!
B000SW4DLM|2.0|Had to watch this for a class. Wasn't a fan of the movie. I actually fell asleep both times i tried to watch it.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|First card game like it so far. Hope it get better when after the campaign. I'm a wait before playing real ppl
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I downloaded the first five chapters free on my Kindle just to check out the book. I've always liked the idea of super heroes, but had never really thought about the world having mostly super villains with the humans trying to fight them for survival!<br /><br />My general take is:<br />-If you've started The Way Of Kings you might consider this book a bit more childish, it is intended to be in my opinion.<br />-There's far less character development than other Sanderson books.<br />-I really enjoyed the fact that the story was told from one PoV.<br />-The inability of the main character to form a metaphor was quite comical.<br />-I read the book in probably 6-8 hours, it's not very long.<br />-I will admit I was disappointed to see it is being turned into another series. While I like Sanderson's writing I am starting to enjoy stand alone books more as I get frustrated waiting for the next one!<br /><br />All in all a great read and a very low cost if you have a Kindle. I'd highly recommend it.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Saw this in the theater and have watched it already a couple of times at home. Really enjoyed the whole movie start to finish.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|One of the most insightful and thought provoking books I've ever read. Tolle is a gift to mankind. I will read it many more times.
B00C8Y21CQ|5.0|It was... AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AND EVEN MORE AWESOME!!! I like the way he does big words biggest awesome ever
B00CE03UOC|4.0|These kinds of games are addictive!  The first boards are easy, but then you get to a point where you must think, strategize to complete the board.  Quick fun.
B00BWE96JY|5.0|Without question the best World War Two series produced to date. Follows Easy Company from basic training to VE day and beyond. It depicts the heroism, fear, brutality and loss that accompanies war. It is war on a personal level told by the men who fought and rubbed elbows with death every day.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I love to play mahjong, but my fire kept freezing with this one, so I had to let it go.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is great. It's kinda hard to work and get at first, if you don't already have experience with minecraft. After you get used to it, is SO much fun. You might hear people saying that Pocket Edition is the worst of the Minecrafts, but they only say that because they compare it to PC. But I think it's by far the best app on EVERY app store, ESPECIALLY the Amazon App Store.
1476734941|5.0|I liked this book because the author did a lot of his own research and documented this.  He logically came up with the 2 days on, 5 days off strategy knowing it would be easier for others because of his own experience.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved The Husband's Secret.  It was very well written and the storyline made me not want to put the book down.  There was more than one character that I could relate to personally.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Story, acting and no CGI ~ everything was done well and entertaining. I enjoying the location shots and the action.<br />More to come I hope!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|An excellent book for all ages.  Beautifully written, with mystery, adventure & thrills at every turn.  A very unique and unforgettable read.
B00DY951TO|5.0|Brand new old Bob Dylan. Wow I'm blown away. I always liked that period around 1970. From what Ive gathered he quit smoking and steped away from the lime light for a while. Bob could croon in those days. It takes me back to my college days when I was first discovering those Dylan records.  It was exciting and new to my ears. The stuff with 'The Band' sounds so fresh. You can hear Levon Helm clearly on backup vocals. 'Working on a guru' with George Harrison is so sweet, and funny when you thin about it. I bought this on vinyl and don't regret a penny of it. You get instant download access with you buy it on Amazon.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Love the movie. I seen it on cable television a few years back and I always wanted to see the movie again. Excellent movie with great quality and a great price. Thankyou.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|The movie was ok...kinda fast paced and it seems like the story line kinda kicked in from the getgo!  Not Brad's best movie but...hey...he's Brad Pitt...a talented actor and also nice to look at!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Was a great read, enjoyed the characters, several twists. Really made you think about how you would react in the situations. Would you do what was right? or what was easiest at the time?
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Great move! The young actors stole the show - not easy to do with Matthew McConaughey on the set! Visually interesting as well. I give it four stars because I didn't find the actual story that compelling.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Loved this trilogy. Had a lot of heart racing situations. The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is too much boring detail that didn't add to the plot. If there had been a little less of this detail, this would have been a page turner!
B0055PMJMW|5.0|I have loved all of his books, and this is one of the best.  I wish they would make every one of his books into a movie.
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|I have the ABBA cd,Greatest Hits & love the movie version particularly the Greek Isles setting. The Blue Ray is fantastic!
B005KLZWZC|5.0|Came early and in great condition. Awesome books with a great storyline. I enjoyed reading them and would buy them again
B009R659L8|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  I may never read another Mary Higgins Clark book.  Can't say anything more.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Could not help but wonder about inconsistencies re: the old series.  Love Dr. McCoy.  Too much emotion from Spock, although this actor does a good job with the subtler emotions, a la Nimoy.
0345410025|4.0|I don,t know ,got it fror granson who is going to Collage next year just hope it will help him.
0440246008|5.0|Great read. My favorite so far. I just started the series a month ago. Very glad I discovered them. !
030745455X|5.0|I loved the prequel, love this one as well. I highly recommend this read to anyone who likes a good thriller.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoyed this game. It was challenging enough, but not overly difficult. Puzzle games I've played in the past have been either super easy or super hard, this one hit a nice balance. I would definitely recommend this game to others looking for a fun way to pass time.
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|Im sorry but  i cant see in my Dvd this this concert. I dont know why. The screen say &#34;wrong region code&#34;
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Can't really give a truthful review at this time, because I have not taken to play it yet, but I don't expect<br />any dislikes.
B00CE004XM|5.0|Great blues from a great player. I've followed his career since he was ten years old! You will love his style and Beth Hart.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This watch arrives in a beautiful watch box and has nearly the same weight and feel of its authentic and much more expensive, the Rolex Daytona. I wear this almost every day and its perfect, its quiet, slim, good looking, and all around worth the price. Buy this.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It started out good but grew very tired of Anastasia whining.  Thought I was reading a Twilight book.  Was told number 2 and 3 were better, not going to find out.
B00466HM28|4.0|I love it its exaclty what I needed as a college student I don't room to have a large midi control but this thing works great! I can map so anything for ableton and there are preset maps u can download to map things out for you. Overall satisfied I mean aside from the fact u can't default full volume on the drum pads its all good
B003V4AK8E|4.0|This controller is MUCH easier and more comfortable to hold and use than the standard. I think this great for anyone who has a PS3.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I admit I am a child of the 60's-70's and was hooked on the original Star Trek TV series and the later Star Trek movies with Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner.  I really like these &#34;prequel&#34; movies as they have chose actors that truly look like younger versions of the original cast.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Josh Homme does it again... this album is more like a dark epic told through grinding guitars, dark melodies and brilliant lyrics. Definitely the Queens best album since songs for the deaf.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|This movie tries to capitalize on Matt Damon's work in the series with Paul Greengrass as the director.  It fails miserably.  With new actors it is difficult to determine who is playing who in the movie.  We all know Matt Damon is Bourne, but who are these other clowns?  In spite of the &#34;spin off&#34; the plot was Ok.  Actors & actresses were good. Quality of the disc is poor.  Disc skip and freezes.  Still haven't seen the entire movie.  Description says &#34;used&#34; not a previous &#34;rental movie&#34; and the special effects disc wasn't provided either.
B000AYELVA|5.0|I love this movie. The X-Men series are excellent fanasty action movies. I cannot wait for the latest Wolverine to become available.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game! get it! the minions are so cute and funny. love this game! i hope they make more games like this
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I realyy love this movie. Jeff Bridges is wonderful in this movie. I am collecting all of the  Joel and Ethan Cohen brothers movies. The Cohen brother makes great movies.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is pretty relaxing, yet challenging. It is simple to get the hang of, and nice to play before bed in order to chill out.
B00F35BV64|5.0|loved the special effects and all the 'back story' that was either never revealed or fully explained in the original TV series...Yes, I'm  a trekkie from 'way' back!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Loved it loved it loved. That girl is my favorite song but i really enjoy the whole cd. Big fan of JT!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I'm not that much into 'action' flicks but I really enjoyed this one as it also contained a healthy smattering of comedy and drama.  Plus, the special effects were totally killer!
1451626096|5.0|Fascinating bridge book connecting Phillipa Gregory's war of the roses series to her Tudor series. Wish they could use this material to continue &#34;the white queen&#34; series through &#34;the Other Queen&#34;. I love all her books!
B0090SI4OC|2.0|This is my favorite book from Ms Meyer and so very unhappy that they changed the looks and character of some of the more important people.  What was great in the book failed in the movie after all the changes.  I mean...what is up with all the ultra modern stainless steel look?  Did the aliens win the lottery?  Why did they cast  the way they did?  This happens so many times...and it fails.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Kevin Spacey is one of our favorite actors and did not disappoint in this performance.  Robin Wright is elegantly beautiful without being flashy in the series.  The other characters are equally well cast.<br /><br />All that said, the series reminds me much of the days when those in Congress actually did wheeling and dealing.  Although the story is harsh at times and shows the manipulative side of those holding office, at least it shows a working government.  Among those of us who are older and remember the days of the Johnson administration, we probably are led to reminisce of &#34;the good ol' days&#34; when self-directed power got things done.<br /><br />Well directed, House of Cards, lived up to and exceeded my expectations.
B008Q0C248|5.0|The acting is superb, it's and all star cast, the setting is amazing! Great place to finish off your understanding of Hamlet after you read the book.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I enjoy the cover as it keeps my Kindle protected and I like how it turns the kindle on and off by opening and closing cover. Elastic strap is good and holds cver closed. I enjoy the fold for support of Kindle in landscape mode. Overall a great cover for the price.
B009GED3HS|4.0|Good but not as great as the other 7 seasons.  We have not seen the final episodes so I may update this at a later date.<br />The laugh track is too loud and gets even louder in Season 9. Even my eight year old finds it annoying.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|It is a delight to watch the interconnection within the family and the way they treat each other, Penelope was great.
B00ECLTYOG|5.0|I am going to miss those guys.They really rock as the Wolf Pack.Chow is awesome too!!! Too sad is the end!!!
B001U0HBPG|5.0|We often come to an understanding of life late in life. We can obtain wisdom early by looking at this movie. I have watched this movie many times to gain it's wisdom.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Highly recommended CD from one of the all  time greatest bands spanning decades.<br />It really couldn't get any greater......... (or could it).
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love  this show! It's amazing and I will be watching it again and again. Can't wait for the new season to start!
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Quite different from games I have played before.  Interactive help if required plus a book of tasks.  Yet still not easy to find.
0425266060|5.0|I love this book! It's perfect if you have a 50 Shades of Grey hangover.  This book is its own and Gideon and Eva are amazing!
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|I guess Will Smith and the director M. Night Shyamalan were just giving the young kid ,Jaden Smith,an expensive intro to the film industry... but I am afraid the joke is on them.  Don't waste your money like I did.  Wait till it comes out on the late night theater show on TV.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great quality and love the added bonus discs.  The case is very nice and has great artwork inside too.  All my other collections are put in books and this one stands along it is a prize in my movie collection.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very good book, loved it and there is great romance and morals. The main charcter and her lover are really close and happy, but the end is heart breaking
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I'm a fan of the Walking Dead and I don't have cable TV so I usually wait for the seasons to come out on DVD and watch all the episodes within a few weeks.  This season, Season 3, I watched in a few days.  There are so many heartbreaks and it makes you wonder how you would be in a situation such as this.  This is just flat out, great TV.  I laughed hysterically during some parts (no joke) and I definitely cried during some others.  This show is engaging and entertaining - And this Season especially will blow your mind.  I cannot wait for the 4th Season to come out.
B009GED3HS|4.0|glad i was able to catch up! I had no idea how to view the season i missed! Until I found it on Amazon!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|You don't need a huge cardboard box to collect dust, so this simple box with all 8 DVDs is perfect. I love all the films and I don't have to search for anything. It's simple and easy.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I cannot say enough about this CD, this music, and this artist. Emile Sande has an outstanding, unique voice with a lot of feeling, soul, and emotion. She also plays the piano, the cello, the clarinet, and writes her own music and music for others. Every song in this CD is heartfelt, and easy to relate to and connect with all her powerful heartfelt lyrics. She is a very talented and intelligent young lady who finished her degree in neuroscience but opted to go back to her passion which is music and to produce her own record which has become a best seller in the UK. She is right up there with Alicia Keys and deserves the same level of fame and she has the same level of talent. I discovered her by hearing Alicia mention her name as a collaborator on one of her new songs from her new \\"the Girl is On Fire\\" CD. I highly recommend this CD and urge others to tell their friends about this great musical talent!!! I listen to and own thousands of CD's. I love music!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Its fast easy and works very well , the streaming quality is good. ability to export all Chrome Browser is what i liked the most.<br /><br />Though Had issues with playing my side loaded songs in Googe Play Music, i am not using chrome cast to listen to songs.<br />Wish they had many other apps except Neflix and Google Play Music / Video.<br /><br />Bought it mainly for Chrome Browser Streaming.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Love it walking dead is and amazing show and when this came in the mail I was so excited :)
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|the Movie is really good but some of the fight are at night so it miss some of the detail of the Iron Man suits,<br />but overall is a great movie.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is great for the mathy people and sudko fans . simple but yet a little challenging.  But not so much as to make u give up. Good job
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm over 50 now but I still love stories or movies involving adolescence and/or the transition to adulthood. This life isn't fair, and sometimes time can run out way too early. Great story and I recommend it.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a very very very good game I play it all the time  at work on my lunch break
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|Awesome 1st season, the second not so much but still a good watch.  Hopefully they can continue to move forward and not lose sight by the success of the show.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Suger,sugar is the perfect game for people with a sweet tooth. Its addicting and fun but the game also makes you use the strategic part of your brain.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I am a huge Supernatural fan and love season 8...the outtakes are great as they usually are. I highly recommend this dvd (as well as all the other seasons of SPN.)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I saw this book once, and only had enough time to read the back of the book. But now that I've read the whole thing it's the best thing I've ever read and truly beautiful. I know in the future I will read this book at least ten times. :) an I see that they are coming out with a movie of this book. I soooo can't wait for it.
159562015X|5.0|This book is great and I really enjoyed what it will mean to my life.  If you're looking for strength to help others read this book.
B007QVLKI2|5.0|This is a great album. The lyrics and vocals are pleasingly unique and the melody has a wide range for various moods. My of the hits on radio were great to have, but some of the lessor know tracks were a great surprise.
B003VO828E|5.0|I like the book it was very enlightening. An awaking to a forgotten era.  A story of the power of the human spirit.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Excellent cast, and John Malkovich was hilarious!  Great movie with both action and humor.  It did not disappoint us and looking forward to part 2.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|These are comfortable and sound great.<br />The wire between the head band and the speakers is exposed, giving them a flimsy feel.  I'm always worried I'm going to accidentally pull that little wire out, but so far its been ok.<br />Otherwise these things have been fantastic!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I love Facebook, but trying to get an app that is actually worth getting is rare to find. This app constantly freezes, force closes,  and whenever I try to delete a post that I posted it won't delete!
B00915G6MG|5.0|Season 10 picks up from season 9 and carries you right along with the teams lives. Dr. Mallard recovers from a heart attack but gets in as ME to review his own case. Family is important as Abby connects with her brother, Ziva and Leon lose a family member. Tim and Tony both deal with their fathers. And Gibbs gets a love interest. We get insights into the war and its effects on servicemen and women.
B00000IQV7|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites because it's a feel good movie and i like moves based on true stories. Robin Williams is awesome in this movie. It's a movie that makes you laugh, cry and wonder at the same time.
160774418X|4.0|Great gift for a friend, took a little while to get there but that was advised in advance. Good value too.
B00633W614|3.0|The novel was a slower read . I felt the character development  was not as structured therefore I was less engaged with their fate.
B000JMKOI2|4.0|Very Bukowski, he gives a raw point of view on life.<br />The character is complex and defeated since day one.
1405911891|5.0|The truth.  Thanks for serving your country with honor. We all appreciate your pain and determination and remain free because of you and yours.
0880796863|5.0|just what i expected. i would recommend “78 levels o wisdom“(Pollack) to go with it. it is a decent deck.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|I get to use my power bricks from my last two MBPs.<br /><br />Having power supplies at work and home is a great thing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It helps slot with the amount of math work i have.<br />Best of all, I can use it in class at anytime!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Fun graphics, vibrant colors, increasingly challenging levels. Only thing they could improve is adding more levels! I enjoy the game.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Love this game its so addicting! It's cute and the graphics are too! Only thing is that the hint isn't very helpful..I also have the greedy spiders 2 and it's fun also !
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|Great movie!!  My 5 year old loves to watch this over and over again, and I love the lost boys.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This story was a magical story with fairies and goblins and unicorns even the old fairy tale stories them selves. if you're in to fairy tales, drama, romance, comedy, and even action, boy is this the book for you
B003Y5H54W|5.0|The film is a Fascinating twist to the classic story. It is mystery and suspense combined into one. It shows the bond Valerie has with her town and its people. When the Wolf comes to claim her again, her friends and the townspeople stand up for her and themselves against the Wolf, who ends up burning its paw by stepping onto holy ground. Then, Valerie discovers the truth about everything when she goes to her grandmother's cottage and finds that her father is the Wolf who murdered her sister, mother, and his own mother. In the end, Valerie followed her heart and lived in her grandmother's house away from the town and her old life, waiting for Peter to return when he had learned to control his curse. Overall, the film was excellent!
B006TVQU6C|1.0|The  Antec High Current Gamer HCG-900, 80 PLUS BRONZE, 900 Watt Power Supply  is to long to fit the Antec computer case.  almost 1/2 of the fan on the power supply is covered by the metal on the bottom, and the 120 mm sytem fan, can not be used, because the power supply is covering the bolt holes on one side where the fan goes....<br /><br />Everything else was ok, but this problem has killed using this case.  I am looking for a better case.
B00D7JQJFG|4.0|Well, not a bad art-book. Nice to look through. I compared it to an art-book about batman movie &#34;batman begins&#34;.
B0032Y0OH0|1.0|Got this to use with PromptDog TelePrompter software.<br /><br />Pros:  It looks cool<br /><br />Cons:<br />- you have to reinstall the software every time you want to change settings.  You cannot get the configure option to launch unless you do that.  (XP and 7)<br /><br />- it is waaaaay to sensitive, even if you change the settings (and reload the software 47x). Causes the TelePrompter to scroll at inhuman speeds<br /><br />The only thing that would have made my experience better was if I had not wasted $60 (with s/h) on it.
1451648545|5.0|This is a captivating and thorough biography of Steve Jobs. Isaacson was fortunate enough to establish a connection with Jobs such that he was invited to write an \\"official\\" biography. His unique access to Steve and primary sources, coupled with his clear writing style, make this so much better than the \\"unofficial\\" biographies of Steve out there. Future generations of Silicon Valley will benefit from this comprehensive and honest account of Steve's life. For sure, entrepreneurs will try to emulate him for decades to come, so it's important to have such an accurate account of Steve's life both from Jobs himself and those who encountered/experienced/worked with him. There is so much to learn and consider from this book.
0374532990|3.0|I was expecting more of a guide to the walk. This is a somewhat interesting history of how it came to be, but not a guide. If you want a history its quite good.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Not too impressed!! Gave my temp as 21 degrees when it was 80!!  Tried several times and it did not change.  Even typed in a more accurate address.
140006922X|5.0|A fascinating and perspective changing book on Jesus. I recommend it to religious and non-religious readers. It will get you thinking.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I did not like when prim died it made me so sad and finnick and Boggs and in the hunger games rue but the rest was really good
B00D2I8E46|3.0|The album cover is a reproduction of city lights books series called 'Pocket Poets'. Check out Allen Ginsberg's Howl and see it for yourself.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Very good book...couldn't put it down.  The conditions in the children's home were horrible and I am so glad for a better life for Jamie.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love Castle so I was worried about how the show would change after they got together. I can't say how much I've loved this season. Even the interplay between Gates and Castle has been wonderfully entertaining. Even if you've already seen it, it's definitely worth the buy.
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|as a visual depiction of the book you may enjoy it,though several departures from the text.  as a stand alone movie... just too slow
B008JFUPK8|5.0|After the disappointing and arguably boring Superman Returns, this film takes Superman to new heights.  The film explores Superman's struggle with acceptance and looking for a place to fit in on Earth.  The film is action packed and puts Superman into a predicament that he has never faced before, and yes this film finally lets Superman throw a punch and show off his strength.  In order to become the hero both of his fathers intended, Superman faces a critical choice. Does Superman protect the planet that adopted him and might not accept him, or does he join the genocidal General Zod and ensure the survival of his own race.  Henry Cavill embodies Superman like never before and portrays a Superman that struggles with carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Michael Shannon gives depth to the villain General Zod and plays the villain as a psychotic lunatic, but with a hint of sympathy.  General Zod is a man who has lost everything due to events that will unfold in the prologue and will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission to save his race.  Amy Adams is a great Lois Lane and could have benefitted from some extra screen time to give the relationship more depth, but can be explored further in the inevitable sequel.  This is a great film and the Superman film I have been waiting for since Superman II was released long ago. Ultimately, this is Clark's story and his journey to become what we all know him as, The Man of Steel: Superman.
0151008116|4.0|i made it a point to read the book before i saw the movie. a fantastic story. the author also came to my town for a book signing and i got this first edition autographed
B000BIQKXM|5.0|This cd was brand new. Never opened, I was very surprised that the cd was brand new! One of the better things I've gotten from Amazon.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Definitely entertaining and sweet! The only reason I didn't give it a five is because it is a little predictable. My preteen daughters loved it.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|IT IS GREAT TO HAVE AN EXTRA MEMORY CARD, I WILL BE GOING TO THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME, I PLAN ON TAKING LOTS OF PICTURES, I WILL BE FLYING & IT WILL NOT BE TAKING MY LAP TOP, SO I WILL NEED 2 FLASH CARDS & NOW I HAVE TWO. WITH 2 i WILL BEABLE TO PROCESS THE PICTURES WHEN I GET HOME.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Just buy it, love the characters, the story is amazing, I couldn't put it down. Definitely a must read! Love!
B001RPD06I|5.0|I got this to add more storage to my music player so I can go for hours on a long drive and not have to hear songs over
B008AK8FHM|1.0|A bit pompous. Read this book and then read the Esquire Magazine article. There are always two sides to consider.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I was hooked in the 1st pages. The partners are well are fast talking lawyers who go after their clients promising them the world. Then by accident the 3rd lawyer find them and decided to work for them for peanuts since he hated his 1st job well paying job with a large firm. He wanted client hands on, which he got. The drug companies spent a fortune to clear their name, If you have read other JG books, you will enjoy this one.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|An interesting tale of a young man's self-sacrafice for his family at the expense of his dreams. The unexpected relationship that happens upsets and alters the path of his life. The director has explored several dynamics in this film, not all of which are as well developed as they could be. One is left with the feeling that some storylines needed more time to take shape or that they didn't drive the overall story like they might have, had they been in the hands of a more experienced director. Enjoyable and watchable, but on my top 100 list.
B009G41CG2|4.0|It's a fun game, keeps my interest and I really enjoy playing it. It was recommended by a friend when we were traveling together. Good selection!

B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|These guys played the Laneway Festival in Detroit before they even released their first album! I could see why. This album is so good. Makes me feel like dancing in my cubicle at work.
B005M4NV1E|4.0|Got the book and then a month a go saw the movie<br />Light book and easy read for light entertainment
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great story, keeps moving and has you guessing.  Non stop read.  Can't wait to catch up and read all the rest.
0804164223|4.0|Listened to this in audiobook, was something that held my interest all the way through and recommend as a suspenseful story
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I am still not sure of the game.  I'm trying to figure everything out. The instructions are not real clear but I'm enjoying finding the hidden things in the rooms.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|We don't get the carrier for this series so were late to epwarching season one<br />Immediately ordered season 2 we became so enthralled with the story
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|this album does not have a single bad track on. not every song is like royals but its still dark, and really fun to listen too. probably the best album to be released this year. nothing sound's out of place, the lyrics are all good,most of the songs are catchy. not to mention she is only 16. talent this good hardly happens at such a young age. buy this album.
0449013634|4.0|The third of Harry hole series that I've had the pleasure of reading<br />Like Girl With Dragon Tattoo series, probably like Harry Hole series

B0065GC0BA|5.0|Well i am not one for tear jerkers or soppy reads so a big surprise for me and of course change my bias in reading A most delightful read.  I didend up with a tear in the corner of my eye and wiped it away before anyone saw me... ha
0449009521|5.0|Harry Hole series is a favorite of mine<br />Can be very violent and graphic<br />Harry as a flawed man makes for intersting character
B00C5R8364|5.0|I have been waiting for Frederick Forsyth's next book since I was in high school and he has never let me down.  He is still sharp as a tack and I have a hard time trying to remember that it is fiction since it meshes so well with current events.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Not a book I would have chosen<br />Selected by book club<br />Really enjoyed it on so many levels<br />Highly recommend
B002UWH8P6|4.0|Humans nature boiling over under stress of the unknown, as it happens over and over throughout history. I like the surprises and how the story was taken in a more serious tone instead of the joking around by the earlier stargates series but sometimes it gets lost and we have to fill in the gaps with our imagination. The story has great potential but sometimes the writers get tired and they get lost.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|it was okay the story line need more of how what and why. I want more background. I still would suggest it.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Impeccable performances that pay tribute to a country music era of the past.<br />the musicianship on this CD is amazing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because it's funny and good. Better than other running game. It's good you should get it. you wont regret it.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Love this show. My saying is if Amazon doesn't have it, it's not out there. Quality DVD. A must for any Big Bang Lover!
B00008G7UF|5.0|The scenes of the French countryside are breathtaking, as are the spot-on performances. Sweet, suspenseful, funny and utterly romantic. Brilliant!
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|If you love Baz Luhrmann's work, add this one.  The native 3D is fabulous, the CGI inventive blending right in, the modern pop/rap music blends perfectly with the re-interpretation of this classic story.  Great 3D and looks as food or better at home than in the cinemas.
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|This film has it all: It is a superbly cast, visually stunning, beautifully written romantic comedy with swoon-worthy music, too!
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|Saw Madonna's MDNA show twice and it was exciting beyond words; she is the Queen!  The Blu-ray was ridden with audio defects and was returned. I'm waiting for the corrected version due out soon.
1476727651|4.0|His name is Dan and he's an alcoholic. He's a drunk for the first part of the novel anyway; thanks to AA Dan sobers up and finds something like a purpose in his life, becoming a hospice worker who helps dying folks shuffle off their mortal coils. Meanwhile he also becomes a mentor to a small kid named Abra, who similarly shines, stronger than Dan ever did.<br /><br />Little Danny Torrance of The Shining (1977) becomes Doctor Sleep's (2013) 40-something Dan in several quick steps, the novel skipping sprightly from the smouldering ruins of the Overlook hotel to the present day, discarding its old seventies skin for the new, sparklier and magic-infused storytelling of latter-day Stephen King novels. Some characters are the same and Jack Torrance's shadow looms large in Dan's life, but otherwise it's a brand new ballgame in a brand new ballpark.<br /><br />There are elaborate villains, for one: a group of psychic vampires called the True Knot. Rambling along the highways of America in their RVs and their campervans, they subsist on something called the steam, a vapor they extract through torture from kids who shine. Through several circumstances, their leader Rose the Hat (thus called because she wears a hat) fixates on the young Abra. With the help of Dan and several other folks, Abra fights back.<br /><br />So gone are the subtle cabin fever atmospherics of The Shining; instead, it's an action-packed psychic fightfest from New England to Colorado, with body swaps and all sorts of mental trickery. And it'd be lying to say it's not fun; it is, extremely, and funny too, with generous doses of humour sprinkled throughout (a particular passage underlines a villain as truly evil because he abhors baseball). King has certainly enjoyed writing the novel, and it shows.<br /><br />The result is almost too relaxed; the writing and plotting are very loose, events and characters often nearly cartoonish. The villains are somewhat hapless as well, suffering from malnutrition and dying of measles. The dangers are mild, and none of the good guys dies in the book, except for centenarians at the hospice whose time it is to croak anyway. And you can trust even mad Jack to swoop in with a helping hand and a wink, as the finale plays out on the site of the old hotel. Some grit and edge would've improved the novel that now seems slightly too nice and polite at times; too neat.<br /><br />There are several references to Joe Hill's excellent NOS4A2 along the way, and there does seem to be something of a mental kinship between the two novels, both being modern fantasy rather than ballbreaking horror. In the end Doctor Sleep may be a sequel to The Shining, but it's none too nostalgic about it.<br /><br />Read all my reviews at mikareadshorrorfiction.wordpress.com
B0077QS9C6|5.0|Not just the best sports movie or best documentary I've ever seen, but easily in my Top Ten movies of all time. The less you know about the very true story of Ayrton Senna the race car driver, the better and more riveting this movie will be. I watched it with a female friend and she loved it as much as I did on second viewing. It has al the elements of a great story and yet it all happened. Sit back and enjoy it- particularly the scenes where you are literally inside his car whipping around the track at over 200 miles an hour.

0761172726|5.0|We have been using this calendar for at least the past 6 years! I can honestly say in our busy lives, we would be lost without it! There is a slot for all of us (2 kids, 2 adults) and an extra for other activities! It is nicely organized, whereas with a traditional wall calendar, you would just have a jumbled mess on each day! Thank you Sandra Boynton for making our lives easier! (still haven't found any stray $100 bills!)
B00EAH3EQG|5.0|She's a very disjointed artist, but this is a very good album nonetheless. I love her and she poured her heart out on here! Bravo!
1451697686|5.0|I am inspired! We already live very frugally by choice and recycle compulsively, but this book showed me even more ways to reduce my footprint and simplify our lives for the better. Excellent book!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I downloaded it but cannot get it to work on my samsung galaxy tab 3 running Android. it will let me type stuff in but then won't do anything. When I hit the Return button it just erases what I wrote and goes back to a blinking cursor. I not only paid for the game I paid for the updates and can't use it. hopefully they will fix this soon as it is an awesome game I have played it on other platforms.
1419705644|5.0|This book explains a lot of the stuff that happens on the TV show.  As a grandparent I like to know what I am allowing my grandchild to watch.  They can watch Adventure time!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is by far THE BEST APP I have EVER purchased for my Kindle Fire. It is amazingly fun! No kidding! My son loves it, I love it, my sister loves it! Plus, the upgrades are free too! That is very rare, mostly free apps are great but you have to pay to upgrade. If you only want one really fun app, get this one!
0385751060|4.0|Purchased book for son. It's a mandatory read for his English class this year. He is enjoying it much more than he expected. (...as a mom, gotta love that!)
B008X9Z37A|5.0|It does what I wanted it to do...it protects the Kindle.  So far, i have no complaints about it.  Price is not bad.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|As usual Justin Hayward excels at what he does and gives us music to enjoy, inspire and live with. It also demonstrates how<br />you needn't be a certain age to follow dreams and be successful as well as appreciated for what you do.
B00CFYAT6O|3.0|I held off purchasing this for about a month after release. I thought Revelator was a pretty decent album, and I like the band. That said, I have to be in the mood for it. Well, I finally grabbed it the day Gov't Mule's Shout! was released. Oops. That album takes a dump all over this one. I just find it very uninspired and boring. Susan's vocals get tiring, and I hate to say this, but Trucks' masterful slide playing does the same at times. The material seems dumbed down and aiming for less discerning listeners. I don't know, just not feeling it. I give it 3 stars out of respect for the high level of musicianship involved and the fact that there are FAR worse albums being made today.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Cher is among the best female voices in the business and I feel this is her best work yet. Another fine example of age, talent and experience having no limits. Not to be picky....but it would have been nice if the album contained 1t least 15 or 16 songs instead of the 11......maybe having a remastering or updating of a few hits like &#34;Believe&#34; added. Otherwise...this is a platinum album from day one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is so amazing. I would definetley recommend it. Get it if you love despicable me and despicable me 2
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|In my opinion part 2 is way better than part 1. I like the beats, there more up tempo and it's more \\"poppy\\" than the first. I have listened straight threw no skipping tracks at least 5 times now and I love it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very thought provoking and entertaining, puzzles are challenging yet solvable.  A very time consuming in a good way.<br /><br /> thank you
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Edited:I just changed my review to 5 stars because of the digital copy and the other formats this set includes. First, you get a choice of which platform you get to use (iTunes, Amazon instant, etc.). I chose Amazon and I can watch this movie from my computer, smart TV, Kindle, and phone. There is a 3-D Blu Ray, a regular Blu Ray, and a plain old DVD that you run on your old DVD player in the kids' room. You really do get a LOT for $38 here.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Best Christmas movie by far.  One of my favorite movies period, of all time.  I watch this thing over and over again during the season and even during the summer.  Just bought the Blu Ray collectors edition on Amazon.  comes with awesome, well made coasters, santa hat, mini moose glass and fake snow.
1476727651|5.0|I have and read 37 books by Stephen King. For me, this is one of the best. It is also one of the scariest. He introduces just the right amount of horror to let the reader's mind be fearful of what's going to happen.  Mr. King is a master with words and story-telling. The flow of the narrative (and story) is perfect. I liked the ending. As Mr. King says life is a wheel. It all comes around.
B000093BDX|3.0|The songs are great but the recording is terrible. The songs sound \\"tinny\\" and almost every one of them starts twice as loud as the rest of the song. It is a great album as far as the choices on it and their songs are always fantastic but the sound quality on this album leaves a lot to be desired. To be honest, I had not contacted the vendor before writing this review, however, now I have and the album will be replaced. I hope the next one sounds better because these songs are really fantastic and I plan to listen to it A LOT!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|After all the publicity for this book, I was very disappointed. The plot becme predicable after reading part way through the novel. I didn't even finish it.
B000000XB9|5.0|This album brought back a lot of great memories from an earlier era. Being from that time, I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it highly. The vendor got it to me quickly and the price was reasonable.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|Pretty sure other people have reviewed this movie already.<br />Just watch it. Always amongst the top 100 things to do with two hours.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|For awhile now i thought Mr. King had lost his magic but this along with Under the Dome has proved me wrong. This sequel was fresh and thoroughly enjoyable. As usual his character development is second to none. He creates real people that could be your neighbor, friend or yourself. I loved the characters and the storyline kept me glued to my Kindle. It's well written, well edited(some previous works could have used some paring down) and an easy read. Buy it, you'll be glad you did.
B003F46RVO|5.0|loved it when it first came out,bought it so my 13 year old grandson can watch it. he has never seen it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Have a more perfect book ever been written? I loved this book. Too much. While I sit here crying I feel happy because they had each other but sad at the same time. This book was utterly brilliant.
0812974611|5.0|Great story wound around lots of history. Good condition. Quick mail. This one was probably more fiction than history, but the history was worth it.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|As realistic as a world with magi and flatheads could be. Well written, sometimes brooding (I say that as a good thing), always riveting fantasy.
B002RRN952|3.0|Wished there was more action involving the old style terminators T800.  Some good effects, but ultimately only OK for me.  Some good effects, but that doesn't make up for a so-so story.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I like this. The end is better than middle. A different style of writing . Hats off to Robert Stevenson
B003204MQS|5.0|Every few years a really good independent horror films comes out: Blair Witch, Saw- this one was great for it's slow building suspense.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|5 stars The book was amusing, kept my attention and I will read the next chapter with great interest and attention
B005DF2QMC|1.0|My unit would only make contact with the tape if you kept your finder down on the play button.  And even then the sound was hissy and garbled at times.  And this happened on several different tapes that played OK in other tape decks.  I quickly returned it and spent more money on a better model.  You do get what you pay for....
B0002BO0HG|5.0|This is the song used on the show, Cold Justice.  I liked it on the show and still do. Glad I bought it.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Tries not to be a &#34;zombie move&#34;- but that's what it is.  A low budget idea with big budget and an A list celebrity.  Ultimately we have seen this before, but it was a nice way to waste three bucks.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The Rosie Project is a good fun read.  If you like The Big Bang Theory on Tv, you'll love this.
B001208QSA|5.0|Another incredible soundtrack from Glass.  Haven't seen the move, and not sure I'd want to- but the score is beautiful.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|feel good movie - realistic events which happen in everyone's life however learning to adjust and cope and actually make the best of a bad situation is hopeful and inspiring. Feeling hopeful about a sad or disturbing situation is a good thing and more movies should aspire to instilling hope in our society - not hatred, fear and terrorism!
B001DUDKEY|1.0|Luckily, I red the book first. Otherwise, I would not understand the plot. Actors  are so much older that their characters!<br />Also, I did not understand why we have to see almost 2 hours Amanda Root and Ciar&aacute;n Hindsye  crooked teeth , and constantly consumed by everybody a large amount of food.I did not like the casting of Frederick Wentworth at all!<br />Yes, even Ann's beauty was gone, she should not look like a 50-years old cleaning lady.<br />It captures Jane Austen's story, it fails in its spirit. Anne is perhaps the most difficult character in all of Austen to portray. Her quiet strength and intelligence are hard to exude on screen. Amanda Root is simply not skilled enough to pull off such a challenging role, where the majority of her lines are unspoken. She portrays instead a dull and vapid creature, almost devoid of personality, When the character actually does have lines, her persona is so very different from the sullen woman portrayed through the rest of the film that it feels utterly incongruous. One of my favorite's from Jane Austen, but sadly the film does not live up to its source.
B00DHHWY9I|3.0|I bought the &#34;Great Gatsby&#34; after seeing all the hype and advertising for it, but for the most part, I just didn't care for it that much.
B00632HWOG|1.0|This did not work for my yahoo business account.  Perhaps I don't know how to use it, but it did not meet my needs
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I Would love to see this one win some awards!  Can't wait to see these guys live at some point as well.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Got this version to keep my baby boy from being frustrated from all of the ads on other versions. Works fine for him now without all of the advertising interruptions.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Even this old lady could do it. However, even my techie daughter can't get my Galaxy tablet to get web content through it. Works great with YouTube.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I went into this with the whole Walking Dead syndrome; guage it's performance compared to that TV show.  I couldn't have been more surprized.  It's nothing like any other Zombie movie, and had a realism to it that made it suspenseful.  I guess the greatest thing about this movie was that they didn't have to say the &#34;f word&#34; every other sentence to help make scenes more suspenseful.  Overall the movie was an excellent watch.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Probably, what this book missed was to emphasis that sharing home responsibilities (which used to be considered only woman's responsibility) is that this is also an important base line for marital happiness.<br /><br />I do not agree with all Sheryl's views, but The information she shares and analyze is enlighten, I was kind of amazed when realizing how actual this issue is in the American business environment and society.<br /><br />I am in total support of the main idea to promote and eliminate gender inequality in the world.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I thought it was shallow and very poorly written .. I had great expectations and was looking forward to a gripping escape ., I can't believe this had such good reviews and sold so well ?
B000V86OKG|5.0|the episodes with Lila were fantastic.  I could not wait for the next episode.  The ending was a huge surprise.
B0082Z447U|2.0|I would not recomend this book. It was very hard to make any sense. I did not read very much of it, but someday I may go back and try to read it again.
B000A2GS2W|5.0|Years ago I had a copy of, &#34;The Best of the Animals.&#34; Since I couldn't play the Lp anymore, I've been missing those great instramentals they played. The organ solos in The House of the Rising Son, cut through you like a hatchet through a grape. The orriginal album is not available with the orriginal songs because of a record company take over. So this CD with the Complete Animals was the next best thing, and includes many more great songs by the group. I can't stop listening to it. It's playing in the background as I type this.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I like this author very much, so any book she writes always is a winner for me. The language is always good, which is important to me, when I select a book.
0307887898|5.0|I have given many copies of this book away... at LeaseQ we run our company on the tenants in the book.  20 years of learning in 290 pages.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|i guess you could say i have more than the norm in music..been collecting for years, and there are 2 or maybe 3 floyd cds and albums i have. This cd is one you need to have....if you dont like it at first or your not a big floyd fan.....just let it play and all the way thru.........just mite become one of your favorites...and if your a floyd fan..&#34;classic&#34;
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Love it! I even cried twice. I love the relationship between Spock and Kirk. They definitely left the ending open for another.
0062255657|5.0|Another winner from Neil Gaiman. Loved it. I'm looking forward very much to whatever projects he does in the future.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|A well paced novel that entraps you in the mystery of the night circus.  Well worth reading to escape to a place of illusion and magic
B00DY951RQ|5.0|This is some of the most satisfying Bob Dylan music ever released.  The alternative versions of the songs from the original Self Portrait are for the most part far superior to what we've heard before and the additional cuts from the Self Portrait and New Morning sessions sparkle with originality and beauty. Dylan's voice has never sounded better, even on the Isle of Wight disc live with the Band. From the bootlegs we've heard previously from this concert and the cuts on the original Self Portrait, who knew this was one of Dylan's greatest performances? Though the deluxe box set is expensive, it's well worth the investment. I expect to get decades of pleasure from mine!
B004ZH66XO|5.0|No ads and you don't need to buy anything to win. Very addicting. I don't know what some of the other reviewers are talking about. I think they have a much older version.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|Greys anatomy will always keep me entertained. Keeps me glued to the screen and it's very insightful to how doctors and nurses handle things
B00CL151G4|5.0|I love this show it is intelligently written and superbly acted.  Amazon had the best price for this dvd set.  Glad I preordered.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This is a book that everyone should read in their lifetime, especially if you are thinking about committing suicide. I loved this book and this author is phenomenal.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|If your a fan you have to have this. A friend let me borrow seasons 1-3 and now my family and I are hooked so we had to buy this.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a secret! And the faster I read to find out, the more intriguing it got. I have now bought 3 of Liane's other books and they are just as good.
B009AP4MGE|5.0|Alot of good things happened in season 4..<br /><br />I choose to rate it 5 cause it was awesome..<br />I didnt like it, I loved it..<br />I do recommend anyone who loves and has not<br />seen season 4 yet.. or if they missed alot of it..
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|Just a great story about how a marriage can get in a rut. LOVE THIS MOVIE! And these two Actors really play the part perfect.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|It was a great film. Full of mystery, adventure, heartbreak and love. I could not tear myself away from the screen. I can't wait to read the book!
B001NLL93W|5.0|WOW I have to say that I was thoroughly surprised at some of the plot twists in here. I guarantee you will too! Although it was a little iffy when it came to language.
B00D4PDJMY|3.0|This album is brutal and not for the faint of heart and is very extreme musically in most places, there are however parts where it grooves just not long enough for my taste. I was though surprised at how much I do go back and listen to it and pick up on a lot of the subleties that you don't hear on first listen because of its' sheer brutality. Some parts of this CD do remind me of Pantera Great Southern Trendkill era but again without as much groove.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Seriously people. I have never seen an app on my kindle wit so much issue and hassle to log in. I as a teen use kik on my kindle, to connect with my friends when my phone is dead. Lately i can no longer do that! I have loved kik from the beginning, but now it does not work. I went to log in about 10 days ago on my kindle. I tried everything from downloading and re downloading the app to restarting my whole device, nothing. nothing i do is fixing this issue. Every time i try to log on it continuously does the same thing. it will say its loading then 2 minutes later a message will appear saying &quot;kik is taking longer to load than usual please come back later and try again&quot;. or something along those lines. I find this problem highly annoying and defeats the purpose of the app. I highly recommend not using it at all or using it on a different device.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|This album is just too good the best thing they have ever done and is clearly Mike Mangini's real premiere playing for them. The drumming on this album is just insane which of course leads to musical insanity but Dream Theater does know when to pull it back and let the songs flourish. This album runs the gamet from heavy, groove, mellow and atmospheric there are even dare I say moments that I could even hear on Top 40 adult contemporary radio (the song Along for the ride especially for this one).
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I don't know  how to explain  this but I love this game it is so fun and hard at the same time
B004P7CN5O|5.0|What a movie - George Clooney at his best, Tarantino, Keitel, this film is filled with great character actors. Action-packed but with a heart ( many bloody hearts...)
B001FB4W02|5.0|I love it. It was all I expected to be on blu-ray. It's a dark season but it's good in the end. It's my second favorite season of smallville.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|great book, especially liked the summary after the end of the book...it answered all the questions about the main characters
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Loved this, so cute. A great story for anyone, not just kids. It's adorable. Watched it at college, all of us love it.
B00CNBS5XS|5.0|My 9 year old grandson loves LEGOS and the more pieces the better. I checked with him before purchasing and he very much approved and is looking forward to opening it on Christmas. As we obviously have not seen the gunship unwrapped yet I cannot tell you how he likes it completed. I think he will love it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Never got passed the ads. I tried to lower the quality, but it doesn't allow me until video is ready, which is never!!! Horrible app!!! If the zero stars was available, I we would've given it to it
0307271080|5.0|This is a beautiful book! Written in the voice of Ifemelu, a Nigerian girl, who comes to US as a tourist and becomes illegal alien; and then does a Fellowship at Princeton and eventually goes back to Nigeria after 14 years.<br /><br />The book is full of Ifemelu's sharp wit and observations about American society and culture, African-Blacks and American-Blacks and the distinctions between the two and makes a very absorbing read.<br /><br />When Ifemelu tells her American-Black boy friend Blaine about shopping for cloths in Malls and he expresses disapproval, Ifemelu retorts \\"So do you grow your own cotton and make your own clothes?\\"<br /><br />Ifemelu talks of different tribes in US: Liberals & conservatives, Rich & poor, White & Black, North & South, Christians & Jewish etc. And she says inter-tribe marriages are possible in all except Liberals & conservatives!<br /><br />From beginning to end, this book makes a great read and is hard to put down.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|After when you feel down it will pick you right up to the nth degree I just love the movie.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Worth the cost of the BluRay.  A movie where you can' anticipate the plot. A lot like Arnold Schwarzenegger in &#34;True Lies&#34;
B002BWQ6H6|1.0|I can not understand why this novel is so highly rated. The writing style is almost childish, almost mechanical. The characters are not believable. I have led a wordly life, and the story just does not fit into the world that I have observed. I gave up about halfway through
B00CL151G4|5.0|Love the chemistry between Holmes and Watson. The script is clean and witty. Highly recommend.<br />Looking forward to Season Two!
B007THA4FI|3.0|Good friend recommended this read so here I am trying to finish.  I just don't like any of the people in the story.  I like to root for someone and this book just doesn't give me that.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Much superior to previous attempt w/Sly Stallone. How they got Karl Urban to keep that helmet on for the whole film must be a story in itself. Good supporting cast and restrained use of CGI in an action film--plus Lena Headley shows off her psycho-bitch chops outside of the Cersei persona
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|I just saw this movie and was thoroughly entranced.  The scenery is spectacular. The plot exciting.  The actors are made for their parts. I loved it.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|Chose the movie because I love R. Pattinson .  I was not disappointed.<br />One of his earlier works, sorry it never got the coverage it should have
1449305172|4.0|I got as much out of reading Ash's material online.  The book was pretty good, but I felt disappointed because he had already released the essence of his material online.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very entertaining and time-consuming.  challenging enough to keep your interest but not too hard or frustrating.  Pretty good as a free game.  Now they need to add more puzzles.
0374533555|5.0|This is a long slog, but totally worth it, if you can last through the verbiage.  Don't read it for entertainment, read it for the concepts that Kahneman discusses .... especially as it relates to why people buy.

B002R27J1W|5.0|Smart, suspensful, and Audrey Hepburn.  A great story line, and a great clean suspensful movie without all the gore, sex and swearing.
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|the movie was ok a little drawn out for my taste and a little boring I would rent instead of buying
1878424319|5.0|Informative to read how you can change your reactions<br />to everyday occurrences. Simple  old fashioned logic.<br />Practice will make life easier.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|The director, the actors all dis very very good jobs and the movie was very true to the book ad the story. However, something about watching it play out and seeing the extreme emotion displayed by Tildas character...It made me sick to my stomach. She is sooo good at her craft and the new actor who plays Kevin was equally impressive. It was very difficult to tear my eyes away even though I was trying to multitask and get some work done while watching it. I knew the story yet it was like reliving it all again but on a much deeper level. I felt deeply for Tildas character. It haunted me for days afterwards which the book didn't do as much I suppose it is because we can buffer out minds in a way from what we are reading in a book and imagine it as we want. but the movie doesn't let us do that. It forces us to see the story in a raw way. The only complain I have about the movie is the god awful soundtrack. I understand the person who selected the music, likely the directory, was probably trying to use such simple, old fashioned, creepy ass annoying music to put us into the moms...or kevins head a little better so we felt just as out of control and confused as they did. but I found myself having to mute the movie and turn on CC to keep watching. I still recommend people watch it as it opens up a discussion about the significant and scary trend we are seeing in society lately.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This book makes a great gift when partnered with The Lincoln Lawyer CD that I recently purchased. It is a well written book.

B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|It was interesting but repetitive.  I enjoyed the first half better than the last for this reason.  The author got bogged down with too many minor facts of history after Jesus death.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Click here to get Doctor Sleep on Amazon!Over the years, plenty of constant readers have wondered, What ever happened to Danny Torrence?<br /><br />Danny Torrence, of course, is that five-year-old boy with the special ability called \\"shining\\", who narrowly escaped death at the hands of his father, who'd been driven insane by a haunted hotel.<br /><br />Or rather, that's who Danny Torrence was. Apparently the master of horror (and Danny's literary father) asked himself the same question enough times that Doctor Sleep, his new novel, is the answer.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is every bit a worthy sequel to The Shining narratively, thematically and in terms of scare.<br /><br />Hail to the King, baby!Doctor Sleep opens in 1980, three years after the events of The Shining. We get a sense of how Danny and his mom Wendy are coping in the aftermath of Jack Torrence and the Overlook. Quickly, the book skips ahead and over the first few dozen pages, we drop in again and again on Dan Torrence now all grown up.<br /><br />Like his father, Dan has become an alcoholic, though Dan's drinking is ostensibly to suppress his shine. Sooner rather than later (thanks to King's tight narrative), Dan finds Alcoholics Anonymous, gets cleaned up and finds work at a hospice, where his particular gift enables him to comfort those at death's door - hence his nickname and the book's title, \\"Doctor Sleep\\".<br /><br />Dan's journey to sobriety turns out to be all prologue. Once he's installed at the hospice, the story truly begins.<br />Have you read this? You need to.Doctor Sleep revolves around Dan's decision to come to the aid of one Abra Stone, a teen girl whose ability to shine dwarfs Dan's own (he compares himself to a flashlight; Abra to a lighthouse). Abra has become the target of a vampire-like group of near-immortals who travel the United States in RVs preying on children who shine.<br /><br />Dan must choose to face his myriad demons: those from his childhood, from his past mistakes and those threatening this little girl who is otherwise helpless.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep draws heavily on its predecessor. Dan is an eerily perfect image of his father, Jack. King uses the culture of AA to explore how we use addictions to hide from pain, and Dan is no exception. The monster that consumed Jack Torrence is always hovering just below the surface, one drink away from consuming Dan as well.<br /><br />In saving Abra, Dan finds that Abra becomes his salvation, too.<br />King gives us a passing reference to Abra Bacon, the character in Steinbeck's masterpiece East of Eden. Steinbeck's Abra represents the possibility of growth and redemption for two brothers, Aron and Cal, who in their separate ways are trying to escape the image of their own father.<br /><br />So too, in committing himself to Abra's good, Dan discovers the strength to choose to resist the lure of the monster within. Dan embraces the truth he learned in AA: he doesn't drink because he's covering up his secrets, or to suppress his shine. Dan drinks because he's an alcoholic.<br /><br />So too for us: we make painful choices because we're broken.<br />Plenty of this. Don't you worry.Just like Dan, just like Cain (on whom Steinbeck's Cal is based), we choose death or life. And so Doctor Sleep really becomes a meditation on the strength to choose life: where it comes from, what gets in its way, and why it's so scary.<br /><br />Speaking of which, you may be wondering if Doctor Sleep is scary. Fear not. It is terrifying. It may not plumb the depths of fear its predecessor did, but then again, maybe it does. I suspect this is largely up to your personal tastes, and I was looking over my shoulder and avoiding dark corners after only a few pages.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is a great, non-stop thrill ride. King fans should love it. It relies heavily enough on The Shining that you should read it first. And yes, I would read the book even if you've seen the film. They're different enough that it matters.<br/><br />Bottom Line: Doctor Sleep is King at the top of his game. It's vintage horror that reflects something terrible and true about the human condition.<br />YOUR TURN: What did you think of Doctor Sleep? Did you like The Shining? Are you happy with the further story of Dan Torrence?/><br />Bottom Line: Doctor Sleep is King at the top of his game.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game a lot.ive only had it for a little but already I can tell its really fun. definitely recommended.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|On the plus side, Canada contained in depth character development, sparse poetic prose, and an intriguing life perspective which was beautifully summed up in the final chapter.  On the negative side, it was an agonizingly slow read.  If you are looking for a fun, entertaining escape, I would not recommend this book.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey really opens up in this book which is a fun, easy read. She talks openly about her career and her life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My brothers and I are just addicted to Minion Rush. We just can't stay away from it. It is my favorite game!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great movie, greater book. Explains in much more detail. It's kinda hard to stick with in the beginning but the adventure really starts once the ship sails.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Great price, keeps accurate time, looks great.  I have had the watch for 3 weeks and have not had to reset the time or worry about winding the watch. Great size doesn't look like a wall clock on my wrist.
B009RX7WTI|4.0|Love this show - hard to wait til it comes out. Hard to believe that we keep losing the stars we love and still keeps us coming back for more.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app rocks!I use it to help me with my homework. Math of course. THIS APP ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!! I love this app , But no adds next time . ITS GOT ADDS!!!!
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|Well directed! Wonderfully acted! Follows the book amazingly! Need I say more. Oh the only flaw they used a schnauzer instead of a Airedale in the movie.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|In my complete and honest opinion I've played and  of course it's fun and everything,but it takes to long to load!  Then since you have wait for it to download on the page! Not a great deal. Also the video is a bit inappropriate for young children so watch out parents!!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was advertised as a young adult book. I'm not sure that young adults have enough contact with or knowedge of Death to be able to understand much of the story. Told by Death, this book brings to life the emotions and devastating effects of the war on a neighborhood of regular, 'normal' Germans. The use of English language is strangely poetic for a narrator such as Death. The development of main characters as they grow from children into teens, of the hidden Jew as he wrestles with his past and his future, and of the foster parents as they struggle to survive financially is beatifully handled. Hints from Death of what the book's climax will be does not prepare the reader for the actual events. The ending is like the cymbal clang in the middle of a symphony concert, jarring and, at the same time, inevitable.  A book I will read again.
B0013D69YE|5.0|What can you say about Queen Bey except that she is one of the greatest entertainers of this (or any) generation? She's amazing and this album is full of hit after hit.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very spiritual book. Made me really think about reality and my portrayal of reality. I owe this book my relationship to God; helped me find my path and what I was missing.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|They just don't make them like this much any more. 5 starts for the storyline (which should have more to come if you read the books), 5 stars for the beautiful scenery, 5 stars for the action scenes, and 5 stars for the computer generated &#34;bad guys&#34;.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a very fun and extremely addictive game. It's very reminiscent of Angry Birds because of the slingshot kind of play that shoots the monkey through the sky to propel him through the game. Plenty of levels to complete, abilities to learn, things to unlock and medals to win. It's really fun to play and you'll have a hard time putting it down.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This book was as engaging at the Magicians Nephew! I would recommend this series readers of all ages. Great Read
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is really fun to play. Many levels to play and replay. It's a really fun, &#34;think your way out&#34; puzzle game that is not too easy but still not extremely difficult to get the hang of as the levels go up. I would definitely reccomend to others.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|A little bit of a self realization book, so if that's up your alley, this is a good one to choose.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Fantastic, beautiful songs a great collection.  Fast service :) I really enjoyed it.  Took me back and brought back a lot of wonderful memories
B00915G6MG|5.0|This is such a great series. Our whole family watches it together. We can't wait until the next season comes out.
6305212112|5.0|I love this movie! (There is some violence.) I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes chick flicks like me!
B0017P520U|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. I home school my son, and I used this movie along with the book, and the CliffsNotes.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I love this movie. I am a sucker for English love stories. It has a great ending. I love Happy endings.
B00019074O|5.0|Silly and so entertaining!  It just never gets old.  I love Eugene Tackleberry-he is so intense.  This is the best of them in my opinion.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent show! Entertaining, enjoyable television with great acting. Well written.  Wish it had a better time slot though, tired of it getting pushed around with sporting event times!
6304806434|5.0|Full of action, pretty violent, but what a ride!  Buscemi is at his best when he plays these kind of characters, and Cage might be the star, but the cast carries him.  There are some big names in here, and they are awesome together!
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This is the first action figure of Sailor Moon in her 20 years of existence that I believe is worth getting.<br />It's small, that's true, but it is incredibly detailed and the paint job is phenomenal for something of that size.<br />There are more parts to this figure than most other action figures out there, with several faces, hands, and accessories to swap out.  The stand is cute and adjustable, too.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would stand up to play.  I think she's more for collectors than as a play-toy, because it seems she's pretty delicate with very small joints.  With gentle positioning you could get her into whatever pose you want without fear of causing damage, but I don't think she could stand up to rough play.<br /><br />She can do just about any pose you want, but I did find it a little hard to do positions that require her arms crossing her body.  Just about everything is articulated though, including places I wouldn't expect (her pigtails, between her body and chest protector, her ankles)<br /><br />You won't regret buying this figure.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|We had no clue what it was about  real thriller loved the suspense. buy it mind blowing action adventure. the end
B006XBSAP2|5.0|This is an awesome CD, and is up there with my favorites.  Every song is excellent- I can't think of one that I don't like.  Katy Perry really put her all into this, and I love the remixes towards the end of the disc.<br />This is definitely one of the CDs I can replay over and over again without getting sick of it.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Not user friendly. Not intuitive. Did not seem to be what was described online. I could not get app to work well.
B008R14YBK|3.0|I watch the Disney Channel regularly, and like Bridgit Mendler.  I bought the CD because I liked the first song, which was played over and over on the Disney Channel.  Unfortunately, I didn't like any of the other songs near as much.  I didn't *dislike* them, but they left something to be desired.<br />It's great casual-driving kind of music, but they're all missing a little something.  Bridgit has a great voice, and she has a lot of talent.  I can't wait to see what else she comes out with.  As of now, I think the lyrics are a bit silly at times, and a lot of the songs sound the same.  This is a great CD for the pre-teen crowd.
B000007WQB|5.0|I have always enjoyed listening to Dionne Warwick's music, saw a concert on PBS, and ordered this CD.  It is so good.  Glad I ordered it!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|After hearing so many songs I liked on the radio and realizing they were all the same group, I decided that buying this CD was a no-brainer.<br />This is my new favorite CD and I can listen to it over and over again without getting bored with it.<br />Some of the songs were a little hard to get into, but after hearing them a couple times, I love them as much as the rest.  It's true that they have some &#34;Queen&#34; influence, as many people like to say, but as a fan of both I really don't think they're the same at all.  Fun. has their own style, which somehow comes off as melancholy and uplifting at the same time.<br />Give them a try!
B0012QRPU4|1.0|I would have never bought the season if I new it was a censored version. I<br /> Will be watching the other seasons somewhere else. Disappointed.
0744014549|3.0|The pictures are kind of cool, but the one thing I wish this guide would do more of is talk about the creative process.  Most of the text in this book is a retelling of the story- which I already knew having played the game.  Even if I hadn't, I would assume if you're buying this book you would be wanting the play the game eventually, and I'm sure the detailed outline of the story wouldn't have been good in terms of spoilers.<br />I enjoyed the artwork, but would have preferred they talk more about what everything is and why they decided to do it that way.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  At first I thought it was just another macho post-apocalyptic study in violence but by the end I was won over by the subtle and not so subtle morality play inserted within.  I recommend it.
B000062X90|5.0|you need this album and Wishbone Ash, Pilgrimage, Blowin' Free (early lives dates) and First Light ( W. A. before they got polished up
B003P2WO5E|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!<br /><br />This book was **THE BEST** fantasy book I've read in years.  If you're thinking about getting, do.  If you're not thinking about getting it, change your mind and get it.  At least read the sample.  This book is wonderful
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|This book is really good and very kid friendly! This would be a good book for kids ages 7-15.  Grown ups might even like it! This is very interesting book and I highly recommend it!  😊
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just want to know wen the 0.8.0 come out but if ur looking at this get this game its so fun iv had it since 0.4.0 and I still play this non stop strust me get this game
B00FF56IR4|3.0|Too many of these tv shows, Revolution comes to mind, are supposed to be gritty or set in a post apocalyptic world and yet everyone is dressed perfectly, their hair freshly blow dried and everything looks nice and clean. It's not hard to make people looks grungy. Just come to my house on a Saturday morning. Also the writing is corny, the action is tepid and all around I'm disappointed.  Maybe not enough budget?? If they can do it pretty right with Falling Skies I know they can do it with these shows. It's just poor vision and casting/hiring.<br /><br />Needs work. Fun concept though. I REALLLLLY hope it gets better.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book had me laughing OUT LOUD! For anyone that has hiked with a heavy back pack, for anyone who works so hard to lighten their load, for any hiker who &#34;lost gear&#34;, this book is will will hit home. Then there is the deeper emotional experiences that this hiker had while on the trail. It was a page turner, but I fought myself to read quickly through. I wanted to savior each chapter.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|Outstanding!  I couldn't stop laughing at this hilariously entertaining movie - my friends and I watch it over and over just for the laughs!
159562015X|1.0|I was not aware when I bought this book that it contained a one time use &#34;code&#34; in it. So the book is useless because the entire book explains what you find when you use the code for the online questionair. Waste of money because it should never be sold as a used book.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I have loved the Disney movie pollyanna since I was little. When I saw the book I thought I'd give it a try. The book is beautiful and filled with even more of the sweetness that calls to me. This book is what I wish there was more of. I wish my daughter had Books filled with joy and hope and happiness instead of snotty little girls who don't obey.  I will read this aloud to her soon.
1451695195|5.0|For those who need credible proof of an afterlife and comfort for those who lost someone to death, this book and the author's credentials are fantastic.
B005544V6A|5.0|great show love it! totally worth watching it!  got hooked after first episode can not stop watching...... Highly recommanded 5 star
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Lots of action. I would watch anything he made. Spoiler Alert: I hated seeing his house destroyed. Made for some great action though.
B00CATONCA|5.0|great box! hope that the next season will be a region free blu ray box! wait for an other great limited season 4 box!
B001B1UO6W|5.0|Good flick brings back childhood memories . Would recommended watching the first chucky then the child's play two and so on and so on.
B00BSZZA3I|3.0|It's cute but doesn't protect the phone from damage when it falls.  It is a pretty neat stand and cleans the screen.
1559277734|5.0|Hell of a good book! Love stories about animals. Excellent production. Readers accent makes the story more real and he does a wonderful job on the different characters in the story.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is great! I have never owned anything at this level, for this price. At first, I had a Razer Deathadder picked out, but I am in filmmaking, and after talking to a few friends who are also editors, they suggested the Anker 8000, over the Razer Deathadder. So, I gave this a shot. Now, it's also a great gaming mouse too. So, the fact that it's universal is a huge plus for me.<br /><br />I love how my hand contours to it too. I have larger hands, and my thumbs are pretty big, and it fits nice. I've had other mice that were way too small, or way too awkwardly big, without any compensation. Not the Anker 8000, it's amazing!<br /><br />The Anker 8000 is the perfect balance between fit and movement. The sensitivity is awesome too. You can adjust everything. The software that you need with this mouse is just simply amazing too. You can macro everything with it. You can even set the sensor to pick up super slow-motion precision, for better modeling and editing.<br /><br />It's a great mouse, and half the cost of most other mice in its league.
B007V65R54|5.0|Appears to be very well researched, a good semi-technical introduction to Bayes' Theorem, an eye-opener in respect to fragile basis of most predictions, and very readable.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Once again Martin does nor disappoint. Deep complex characters and plot along with detail. Always finishes the reading wanting more.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app has been very useful. It lets you know exactly how much battery life you have left to watch movies, play games or read your books.
