0316228532|1.0|Though her humanity and empathy for the human spirit remain, Rowling's wit,taste, charm and wonderful humor are lacking in this book.  The heavy topics are dealt with in an offensive manner.  I'm disappointed in this book, and think she could do much better.
B003L20IJM|5.0|I love him
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is great. Although it has the same idea as minecraft, it has better controls. The developers clearly put a lot of effort into this game.<br /><br />I especially like how the ores give off different light, and the floating islands. They both make great looking effects that you won't find anywhere in minecraft.<br /><br />Out of ten? Eleven!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Dumbest game ever!Its hard to drive, I had crashed a million times and its hard to turn left and right.This game is really stupid.

B0029QRA1U|4.0|This record player is a god entry level player.  It is quiet and operates well. I would recommend it for the casual listener.
B0043ZDFEQ|3.0|The songs from Sammy's Turtle Tale are great the others are trash talk!<br />This guy mixes music types that don't go work, don't get this album without listening to all tracks!
0345803485|1.0|This is the most annoying book I have read since Marc Levy's \\"Et si c'était vrai\\". How can a piece like this attract so much interest?
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I'm on a Kindle Fire and would be nice if this would update soon,, andorid version already updated now jus waiting for this one /: UPDATE SOON PLEASE?!?!?!
B002M87V0A|5.0|This is without a doubt the very best movie ever produced. The acting is superior and the music although dated is excellent. I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 60... The young people today don't have clue to what real music is. They would not like it at all.
0525953728|5.0|Since I knew the ending, this was not a suspenseful read.  It was however very entertaining, interesting, and informative.  Mark dispelled some of the myths surrounding the killing of UBL and appeared very honest about his fears and emotions - or non-emotions.  I was stationed in the E-Ring of Pentagon in the early 1980s in OP-60 and later OP-06 working for Admiral Art Moreau when Commander Dick Marcinko was forming Seal Team Six.  I had just finished reading Marcinko's biography Rogue Warrior prior to reading No Easy Day.  Quite a comparison in warrior styles and characters to say the least.  Mark's willingness to risk ostracizing himself from his friends and fellow warriors by going public with the details of the end of one of America's most vicious enemies is to be commended.  I am sure it was a difficult decision but Americans appreciate knowing the truth without the political or biased media spin.  The most telling fact of Mark's concern for his fellow warriors is that he donates much of the proceeds from the book, and he requests that readers consider donating, to charities that support military heroes and their families.  I enjoyed this book and heartily recommend it if you want to learn more of the actual facts of the raid that killed UBL.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I loved this game! Was up to level 82 when it reset itself and I was back at level 1. All my hard work GONE.  I reported the problem but no one fixed it. I will most likely play it again. Just pretty frustrating.
B003TOMAPC|2.0|Kick Ass is an ok movie. Everything about it is just average. Too many \\"timely\\" references like MySpace to make the movie hip I suppose?<br />The real star of the movie is Hit Girl. Chloe Moretz is fantastic and her story is far more interesting then Kick Ass's story. A Hit Girl movie would be fun, and I think it shows a sidekick can work in a superhero film.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I absolutely love this book i have to get the next one!!!!!!!!! it is so awsome i cant believe it ended like that.
B000V656X4|5.0|Asia the group that contains personnel from the group Yes is similar to Yes but unique in it't own right. well done done and enjoyed by the masses.
B00846WWVM|4.0|I have this on my phone and I loved it. glad its on kindle fire now!! wish sprinkle Jr. was also on here for my little one. she really enjoys that game which is aimed at a younger audience. I would've given five stars if sprinkle Jr was also available.

B0087HT36U|4.0|cool game my kids and i like to sit and play this game together before  we go to bed sometimes and it is a lot of fun.
0316228532|5.0|JK captures brilliantly the everyday life in England that I grew up with. However, I hate this book because it brings back all the ghastly memories I prefer to forget. This is why I left England to become an American citizen. I admire JK's courage to write this book. It captures history and 200 years from now it will probably be read along with the books of Jane Austin and Charles Dickens who captured the everyday life of England in their time.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Such an addictive game I play it the whole time I am at work when I am supposed to be doing my work
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app allows me to use my kindle even more for business. I carry my kindle almost everywhere and using the calculator plus app was at my fingertips when I needed it most saving me time and money.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i love this app on my kindle fire! all my phots upload great and i can edit them perfectly fine. i sugest this to everybody! it makes my pictures lookso beautiful! get it you wont regret it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|In recent years, all of King's later books seemed to be a rehash of what went on in his earlier books.  I had stopped reading him, and then I was told that this book was different.  I gave it a shot, and was pleasantly surprised.  A real page turner, lots of interesting characters, lots of interesting fodder for thought.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Tempest\\".  \\"Pay in Blood\\" & \\"Scarlet Town\\" are excellent & several of the other songs are very good.  Dylan's voice is no worse than in his previous album & as Keith Richards (no fan!) said of his voice \\"He knows exactly how to put it.\\"  I am astonished at how cheap it is to buy songs of the most important musician of the last 50 years.  I suspect that this is his farewell to music as Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\" was to play-writing, but I hope not.
B008XG1X18|1.0|this app crashes more then it works. I love pinterest but they nerd to work on the app.  its slow and I have to close it out 3 to 4 times everytime I want to use it
B005898DDO|5.0|Awesome footage and dialogue. I would recommend this to any Dylan fan. The description of how he went from folk to rock is fascinating.
1423140605|4.0|I read this in two days, like all my 570 page books, and it was awesome, had some parts I didn't take too, but that's with anything, the overall story was great. And I am a huge Percabeth fanatic and this gave me sooo much fodder for my Insanity.. I am 30 and admit that I am in love with this series and wait for it with as much anticipation as I did the Harry Potter book/movie empire.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool series was refreshing; something new in a genre overrun with boring carbon copies and franchise works. It reminded me of the good ol' days of science fiction when almost every book was something new.
B0086700CM|4.0|it's a good game, great to kill time. I found that the later areas are glitches from time to time.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Jane Doe is like nothing I've ever heard before. Packed with emotion and intensity, it slowly but surely fills me with emotions I've never before felt. The album gives life to Jane and allows you to hate her for all her flaws, but at the same time, love her for her undeniable perfection. Jane Doe has something for everyone. All you have to do is listen with open ears, an open mind, and an open heart. \\"Run on girl, run on\\" - Jane Doe
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love all the great ideas in this app; never had any kind of connection issues.  If u are a creative soul this app is for u.  the best part is the price --free!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I finally purchased this CD.  I love every song on it and now can listen to it while I am driving.  Wish I had purchased it earlier.  Every song on the CD is a hit.  Her voice is just outstanding.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This movie is a must watch and if you have already watched it like I have many times,it does'nt hurt to rewatch again, you can watch it instantly and for so cheap, which made it even better, even the quality is great.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app, unlike those that limit themselves to simple temperature, precipitation, wind speed/direction and the like, goes so far as to include a page for 'lifestyle', which will let you know whether it's a good day for fishing, skiing, arthritics (!), etc.  It's flawed only by a bias against staying indoors with a good book even when the weather outside is perfect!<br /><br />  Oh, and it does all that, along with providing radar maps, precipitation, moon phase, and so on, for anywhere on the planet.<br /><br />  And that's the just free version!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Yeyyyy,  love the app and use it daily. This one's on my Kindle Fire and it works great. Thanks for making it free!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I heard about Sixto Rodriguez in the recent film documentary \\"Searching for Sugarman\\". The songs highlighted in the film caught my attention immediately and I still have a hard time understanding why he didn't catch on in the U.S. The record companies appear to take a large share of the blame. Because of his cult status in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, I bought his album Cold Fact. Every song on the album has very interesting lyrics and hauntingly beautiful melodies that his great voice brings out. I also appreciate having all the words printed in the packet. It's my best surprise of the year.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|What is there to say?  Sorry I waited so long to watch it.<br />If this isn't a mirror image of the atrocities of early America, nothing is...shame on the U S, and yeah...I was born here too!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is a awsomee game bit it has a few flaws in the game like on how much it cost to take out a hill in the game
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl has an interesting and unique plot.  It is a relatively quick read.  However, do we ultimately care about two psychotic, narcissistic characters?  I'm not sure in the end that I really did.
B008G12ERC|2.0|I have listened to this album straight through, multiple times. Every time I do, I can't help but think that much of the music came off of another artists album. The song 'Follow me' makes me want to brake into Gloria Gaynor's \\"I Will Survive\\". I can hear Queens \\"One Year of Love\\" and \\"Don't Stop me Now\\" throughout 'Explorer'. First thing I thought about when I heard 'Panic Station' was David Bowie. I can hear Roger Waters and David Gilmour in several areas with some U2 thrown in. Lyrics are straight-forward and less challenging. Christophers songs do not belong on this album at all. He has a wonderful voice, but it is better for backing a lead singer. The last two \\"songs\\" are an exercise in mediocrity. Dubstep was a step in the wrong direction (absolutely no pun intended). There seems to be a lack of complexity I am used to from MUSE. This album seems like an ode to other artists music. And therein lies the problem. Who are they trying to cater to. How many different groups of listeners are they aiming for. I know that all bands tend to go downhill artistically after their fourth or fifth album. I guess my expectations were higher for Muse. I wanted more and got less. SOAD and the Foo Fighters are on hiatus. Maybe a hiatus would do MUSE some good.<br /><br />10/26/12: A friend of mine said that 'it was an album of B-sides with the dial turned up to 11'. That sums it up perfectly.
3836503050|5.0|THIS TASCHEN 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION OF GIL ELVGRENS' WORK IS STELLAR. THE PIN-UPS ARE ADORABLE AND COVER THE DECADES OF MID 1930,1940,1950 AND 1960.

MY HUSBAND LOVED IT AND I GOT A KICK OUT OF IT TOO!
0525478817|5.0|I preordered The Fault In Our Stars when it was first released only to wait months for my signed copy. Best decision ever...<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars, is so great, because any attempts to outline the plot or characters make it sound like one of the worst books ever written. Green has always excelled at writing the sorts of young-adult books where the characters learn important things about themselves, which is already dangerous territory for writing.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I loved the way it went from being laugh-out-loud funny to gut-wrenchingly depressing in a matter of moments. Hazel and Augustus were really interesting characters. They definitely didn't talk like most teenagers I see today, but they still seemed realistic to me, given everything that they've been through. I also really enjoyed reading about Isaac. He's not a huge part in the novel, but his scenes were definitely some of my favorites.<br /><br />The Van Houten section of the book was a little strange. I understand why that whole bit was there - and, really, there wouldn't be that much to the plot if you took it out - but it seemed a bit unrealistic to me, especially as the book went on. And I wish we could see more of a reaction to the letter that Hazel reads at the end of the book. I'm really not sure what to make of it. It kind of sounded insulting at times, and yet it was also very sweet. At the very least, it forced me stop and think for a while, which isn't something that every book does, so that was refreshing. All in all an amazing book that I highly recommend you read.
B006VC3LES|5.0|I agree with other reviewers, in that Chinatown is definitely in my top-ten list of all time, as well. I received the BD the end of August (2012) and have just now taken a look at it. My screen is a Panasonic 42 inch Plasma-- absolutely right-on in its video quality, color balance, and all adjustments (made by myself -- and not some Geek-Squad guy!!). I used to be a photographer for many years, so I'm very quick to spot any resolution and color saturation,  tonal discrepancies quickly. My BD player is the Oppo BDP-93 -- fabulous video processor! Read some of the many reviews of this BD player online -- and get one!<br /><br />Anyway ... back to Jack, and Chinatown. I am very pleased with the quality of this incarnation of this movie: excellent resolution-looking at the rocks, for instance, in an early scene, at the dam (in daylight) where Mulwray is watched by Nicholson from a distance - every rock could be discerned sharply outlined, and crisp. Shadow detail is very good also. Overall contrast is also excellent. I want to say simply, that this BD for me, and on my system, audio included, is first rate, and an easy recommendation for any Chinatown lover. Sit back and enjoy !!<br /><br />I forgot to make a comment on graininess, mentioned in another, excellent, review. I personally did not see any objectionable, if any, grain at all, from what I have watched so far. I think of the old B&W print days, and various degrees of grain,  be it intended or not. So, in that context, I did not see any obvious grain. I'm not as well versed in the video world yet -- I do wear my distance eye glasses (prescription) for critical viewing on-screen, so I will let you other guys write in more detail about the technical end! :-)
1451662432|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book -- it is informative and entertaining and fun to read--it's Arnold! The details of his life in Austria --the early body building years-all the background info was enjoyable to me--I have always admired the fact that Arnold decided when he was young to come to the US and he followed thru on it and has been a huge success--and he has never been shy about saying it could only have happened here<br />Has he been perfect? of course not and it's mostly none of our business on the details
0375413405|5.0|Wonderful!  This was a special treat to me that I decided I wanted after seeing the movie \\"Julie and Julia.\\"  Can't wait to try some of the recipes.
B0088X7YMS|4.0|This is a cute movie that follows the plot of the movies, is a pitty they did not use the voices in the movies..
B008MG1E4A|3.0|An easy read which even those who do not have any military background will be able to comprehend and appreciate. While it does not have the same level of thrill or suspense compared when reading Clancy or Ludlum novels it makes you turn those pages with interest knowing that its the personal account of someone involved in taking down UBL.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Among Child's best. Have read all Reacher books. True intent of bad guys at end was a bit of a letdown. I did appreciate it being sex-free.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put it down! The author did a wonderful job of projecting emotion. I often found myself staying up way too late because I was engulfed in the story!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Exquisite!  Very much well done - beautiful music combined from classical, vocal, wonderful selections and arrangements.  It reminds us of the three great tenors.  We bought all five albums.  Great music!
B0091THRCU|4.0|This product is wonderful! The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it's sometimes inconvenient when you have that important call and you can't extract the phone quick enough. Otherwise it's a wonderful idea, I use to have a blackberry and had always used a similar pouch protector, and just love the concept of it.<br />Some good things about this case is that it has great deterrence to \\"TEXT/TALK and DRIVE\\". Especially if you drive a manual car. All in all, great concept, great case, and the pull tab system they have going on is a great idea to extract the phone without having to ruin the case.

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Enjoyed the challenge and story line. Good deal for 99&cent;. Will definetly be getting game 2 to continue on and see how this plays out. Puzzles aren't too challenging either so didn't use the skip option. I like how each puzzle had instructions if you were stumped
B0083SBJXS|5.0|After 500+ reviews on Amazon, does anything really need to be said about the movie itself? What I really enjoyed were the extras on the DVD. I'm not normally a person who geeks out over blooper reels or stuff that was cut (because the bloopers aren't often all that funny and the stuff that was cut, well, it was usually cut for a reason).<br /><br />But in this case, the cut scenes actually filled in a lot of blanks in the movie, and I would love to see an \\"uncut\\" version released. Warning! Spoiler! Of particular interest was the scene involving Hawkeye and Loki. This scene really fleshes out some more of what went on while Hawkeye was Loki's thrall, and also changes a little of the dynamic when you realize it was enthralled Hawkeye's idea for Loki's stunt in Germany. The scene added a little depth to Hawkeye's character insofar as how his mind works, even when under mind control.<br /><br />Best of the bloopers: let's just say just like in the actual movie, Hulk steals the show. Once you watch the bloopers, you will know exactly what I mean. I laughed harder at the blooper scene than I did during the \\"puny god\\" quip.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I like every one of Lee Child's books. Can't wait for the next. I find it hard to believe that Tom Cruise will be Reacher in the movie. As always a nice pace of action with this novel. Child gets you thinking but keeps you guessing. I recommend all of his books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I received this book on my kindle at 9pm and finished it at 12:21pm. That is how engrossing this book was. I do not write reviews, but this installment deserved it. This is no shades of grey.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|very challenging,  great graghics and sound. Loved the hints and the realistic surroundings. Recommend Big Fish games to anyone who enjoys search games with a story line.
B008G12ERC|4.0|Muse's new album The 2nd Law has been a much talked about subject for me lately and I feel the need to go into detail about what this album has, what to expect, and why it warrants repeat listens.  With this being Muse's 6th studio album, their style continues to grow and evolve with each release and this one is no different.  Much like their previous albums, at first listen long time fans might be put off, but as with all their work, they will make a fan out of you if you give them the chance.  There is a lot going on with this album, so I will dissect it track by track.<br /><br />Track 1 - Supremacy<br />Right at the start they come out with a dominant track.  From an instrumental standpoint it sounds like a piece worthy of being in a videogame, like a Final Fantasy pre-boss discussion/FMV piece.  For this reviewer it evoked the same feelings brought out by the track Ruled By Secrecy from Absolution.  That track felt like a missing track from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night that was given lyrics.  This is a song that I felt would be better...without lyrics.  Not that they're bad or anything, just that the vocals are kinda distracting.  They seem to take away the majestic sense of power the melody provokes.<br /><br />Track 2 - Madness<br />This track is the Muse track one would expect from a \\"new album\\".  There's a lot going on here with some new elements being incorporated into their style.  The combination of it's solid melody and dreamy vocals makes it a song that will only continue to grow on listeners over time even in spite of the heavy reverb/dub element.<br /><br />Track 3 - Panic Station<br />This is the obviously-not-traditional-Muse style track.  First thing that comes to mind is Supermassive Black Hole from Black Holes and Revelations.  That's a track that was emulating another band's style and they were incorporating it into their own and the same thing it happening here.  It has the potential to be a polarizing track for long-time Muse fans, butits funky tune and earworm chorus has the potential to make this a commercially viable, music chart rising track with radio play.<br /><br />Track 4 - Prelude<br />Much like the initial track \\"Intro\\" from Absolution, this track serves to set the tone for the track it leads into, but unlike Absolution's Intro, Prelude was instead placed here, toward the middle of the album.  At first glance one may think it should be placed at the front of the album as the lead-in track, but if you look at this album as going through movements or stages, then it makes sense where it is.  It sets the tone that Act 1 is over and Act 2 is about to begin.<br /><br />Track 5 - Survival<br />My opinion of this track continues to change with each listen.  At first I didn't care for it, then it really grew on me, then it began to grate on me again.  I can't commit to how I feel about this track.  Maybe it's the fact that it was tied to the Olympics.  Maybe it's the feel that it's channeling Queen and they're trying to do a victorious song like We Are The Champions or We Will Rock You but feels less sincere.  Regardless of its true purpose, one thing I believe wholeheartedly is this: that the song is strengthened by the presence of the Prelude before it.<br /><br />Track 6 - Follow Me<br />If you're looking for a track that feels like required filler to move an album or theme along, then look no further than Follow Me.  It's not a bad song by any means, but it's nothing special either.  Compared to the rest of the songs on the album, this track is devoid of life and inspiration.  It almost feels like the band is just going through the motions.<br /><br />Track 7 - Animals<br />If you're looking for a track that feels like their past work, then look no further than Animals.  The melody and instrumentation sounds like a deleted track from Origin of Symmetry that they reworked to release here.  It may not resonate with newer fans as strongly as other tracks, but it is a prime of example of a track one could leave on repeat and get immersed into the song.  My one concern is that the sound effect of a mob at the end was a bit much.  It easily could've cut out along with the music and nothing would've been lost.<br /><br />Track 8 - Explorers<br />This is the \\"Ballad\\" of the album.  It easily evokes similar feelings like past songs have.  Unintended, Invincible, and even Endlessly come to mind.  This track appears to set the stage for the next \\"phase\\" in the album, much like how Prelude set the stage for the previous phase.  This is another track that could rise in the charts with radio play.<br /><br />Track 9 - The Big Freeze<br />Much like Follow Me, this is another track that is a little weak.  From a lyrical standpoint it has Matthew Bellamy's touch all over it, but doesn't have that wow factor.  It feels like a band trying to emulate Muse, or more aptly, Muse trying to emulate a cover band of themselves, if that makes any sense.  As a result, it feels like more filler.<br /><br />Track 10 - Save Me<br />The first of two track sung by Chris Wolstenholme.  Right off the bad Chris' voice will polarize long-time fans who've come to expect to hear Bellamy's voice.  Chris' voice isn't bad and the song isn't weak, however, I think what would've been best is to release a \\"pre-album\\" like \\"Muse: The Chris Wolstenholme Project\\" or something like that to prepare listeners for the transition.  In spite of the change in vocalist (or perhaps because of), the song seems stifled and muted.  Acceptable for being a new song from a different vocalist, but it could a frowned upon move as well.<br /><br />Track 11 - Liquid State<br />The second of two tracks sung by Chris.  This song is has a heavier sound than the previous track. bit still lacks that \\"wow\\" element listeners will be looking for.  Vocals still take some getting used to, but this track did do one thing for me at least: Make me wish they would consider a \\"Chris Wolstenholme Project\\" just to see if he could possibly expand his vocal abilities.  Still be the trio, but let Chris take point on vocals.  And perhaps change up themes a bit and not just be about alcoholism.<br /><br />Track 12 - The 2nd Law: Unsustainable<br />The first movement in the two-part title track of the album.  This is the track that strongly uses dubstep elements...and it's so outta place, even for Muse.  The track has such great potential as it starts that with a solid melody that's building to something, then the hardcore \\"wub wub wub\\" crash hits and it destroys the song.  The truly sad part is that it is used at the right parts in the song, but it just so sharply contrasts the established beat that it comes off, not as an enhancing twist or an ironic deconstruction, but just...noise.<br /><br />Track 13 - The 2nd Law: Isolated System<br />This is the antithesis of Unsustainable.  This is the track it wish it was.  It starts off with a soft melody that steadily enhances over time.  My only issue with the track is that it sounds more like an intro to a 2-piece set instead of a closer.  And there in lies the rub with the two-movement title track: instead of being clearly defined complementary parts like the 3-piece Exo-genesis movement from their previous album The Resistance, Unsustainable and Isolated System sound like to two completely different tracks vying for dominance instead of harmony.<br /><br />So there you have it, this person's take on the album.  Now you may be asking yourself why I gave it 4 stars if it sounds like most of the songs have flaws.  That doesn't seem to correlate, but it does when you incorporate what I first said that the album requires repeat listens.  This album may not have many WOW, knock your socks off tracks, but when taken as a whole, it is a solid album.  One that can be appreciated when taken as a collective instead of looking just for \\"highlights\\".<br /><br />If you read this far, I hope you found this review helpful.  Give the album a listen and see for yourselfthat The 2nd Law warrants repeats listens to appreciate.
B0000U1NHO|3.0|I tried to review this earlier but it kept saying \\"try again later\\"??  That's too bad because the earlier version of the review (now lost) was a \\"masterpiece\\"!<br /><br />There were a few problems with this order although some of them may not have been the seller's fault.  1-The jewel case was cracked.  2-It was a German release: the title and liner notes were all in German. 3-In a couple of cases the artist OR the version of the song was different than the one in the movie (i.e. Girls Aloud instead of The Pointer Sisters and a more polished but less appealing version of All I Want For Christmas by Olivia Olson than the one heard in the movie).<br /><br />I did not pay a lot for this CD so I'm not that upset about these discrepancies.  I do think, however, that the product I received was not precisely the product I ordered.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|So, when I saw that this was finally released, I couldn't have been more excited.  However, I was so disappointed in the sequel to Bared to You.  I must have read Bared to You ten times, and I absolutely loved it.  When I picked up Reflected in You, I was hoping to be just as impressed.  I started the book, and it was one of those books that I had to convince myself to keep reading, hoping that it would get better.<br /><br />I love to read these kind of books, and have read hundreds, which is not an exaggeration.  But I have to say it was disappointing; So I hope some of you read this review and at least go into reading this book not expecting anything.
0316228532|5.0|I just got this book in the mail, and I just can't wait to spend all night reading the newest Harry Potter!
B003L77G6A|5.0|I just reviewed season three so I don't have too much to add. I enjoyed season 4 a lot because the addition of Mayim Bialek (hope her name is spelled correctly) has added much to my enjoyment of the show. The development of \\"Shamy\\" has been a delight to watch. Amy is a foil for Sheldon, but she's not a female Sheldon. Whereas he never cared about fitting in or missing out on social events in high school (and college), she does regret not having those experiences. In her friendship with Penny (which she takes great delight in), she's trying to experience all the social events she missed. It's fun to see Amy (who was bullied in high school for being smart) becoming friends with Penny, who was the popular girl in high school (and was perhaps a bit of a bully as is exposed in one episode). Amy has a bit of a girl crush on Penny (well, maybe more than a bit)and sometimes doesn't recognize personal boundaries, but Penny is fairly gracious and kind about this. Watching Sheldon mature emotionally (recognize he has strong romantic feelings for Amy)is heartwarming. I love it. Although I don't mention the other characters, I enjoy them too. I've always liked Howard. Raj is my least favorite because there always seems to be a bit of meanness behind his humor. I find him to be a bit creepy. Overall, this is one of the BEST shows on tv. Tops my list (replacing Castle and New Girl). Although I'm still loving Fringe.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The series was awesome. I loved it from the start and connected with all the characters. With all the surprises and pop up factors that made you jump, it still made you think ' could that happen to us'?<br />The end was somewhat expected as I wasn't surprised of the ending. However I wanted more, there are so many unanswered questions and fill ins still lingering.<br />The writing died down towards the end, maybe Suzzane got tired or ran out of ideas but it showed. Can't wait to see the movies now?<br /><br />Awesome series!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I never watched this show until a co-worker insisted that I, as a sci-fi geek, would LOVE it. She loaned me the first two seasons on dvd and I inhaled them. The cast is wonderful, the acting is good (Jim Parsons!!!!!)and the writing is excellent. It's such a breath of fresh air to see a show about a group of very smart people whose differences are celebrated. In today's world, describing yourself as an \\"intellectual\\" and as not religious or (the horror) as an atheist is comparable to being a puppy killer. I love that this group of people are smarty-pants and proud of it. I like their acceptance and affection for Penny, who isn't their intellectual equal, but often has much more common sense than they do. Sheldon is my favorite character. I particularly enjoy his relationship with Penny and how he learns that being a genius doesn't always make you the smartest person in the room. This show delivers the message that it's important to be yourself, be accepting of your strengths and differences, and not be afraid to go against the crowd. I absolutely adore this show. In fact, I'm going to purchase the season one dvd right now!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow. Gideon Cross. I think he's even hotter than I remember!  Book 2 in the Crossfire Series was an excellent continuation of Gideon and Eva's story.<br /><br />Without giving this book away at all I can say that it's full of drama, angst and scorching hot love scenes! Gideon and Eva's relationship is nothing short of difficult with both of them dealing with past issues and insecurities. It's an emotional roller coaster of a story. When things are bad it's really bad and when it's good, it's really good! And the sex is REALLY GOOD! I felt Eva's frustrations throughout the entire book  with all of Gideon's ups and downs. They have an  extremely addictive relationship and they are each others choice of drug! I wouldn't give up Gideon either if I were Eva!<br /><br />I am completely addicted to their story and can't wait for Entwined With You!<br />[...]
1932735410|5.0|I passed my PMP exam today, and I have to give a lot of credit to Rita and her book. She helped me study effectively and efficiently.  She explained concepts from the PMBOK in a way that was meaningful from my background and experience. Her guidance on dwell-time in study, how to interpret vague phrases in questions, and how to apporach nuances and shades of meaning pulled me through the exam and helped me better understand the PMBOK.  Thank you Lauire for following up with this edition.<br />Fantastic book, well worth it's weight vs. the cost of the exam!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|this is like the best game ever! you are stupid if you dont get it. you should be happy its not 99&cent; (even if it was i would still get it). get it get it now or you will miss out on the most awsame game in the world! get it get it get ot get it get it get it get it get it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|totally addictive! I can't stop playing!! you will not be disappointed if you download this game!!  great sounds and super challenges!
B002POVIMS|5.0|Great album start to finish! Love to hear this album on headphones, you can hear all the hidden sounds and the bass is loud! Also fun to dance to!Love it!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Reviews for this book kept popping up, in magazines and newspapers, it sounded fascinating, and I was ready for a good read.<br />BUT I struggled with this book from start to finish. I was disappointed with the he said/she said style, with each chapter, giving each others version of their story. I found it frustrating. I was waiting for a third party to step in and take over the story, so it would flow consistantly instead of back and forth.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Although dated, the movie started with a good concept.  Ultimately, it fizzled.  A scene in the trailer, produced to entice the viewer into believing that there will be an ultimate showdown of man v. beast, never occurs.  Major disappointment.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is super addicting. If you love Mario than you'll love this!!!  I can sit here and play all day!
B00005JA8B|5.0|This is the story where Arnold \\"the Governator\\" Schwarzenegger, Jesse \\"the Body\\" Ventura, and some other people go to the jungle and find themselves face to face with THE PREDATOR!  An invisible, tree-hopping, laser-shooting, green blood-bleeding alien with an oddly human laugh.  Why is the Predator trying so hard to kill Arnold?  Who knows?  What else are ya gonna do on a Saturday night if you live in the jungle?<br /><br />This is a classic, red-blooded American, meat-eating, flag-waving, gun-shooting action flick.  The characters crack one-liners, their eyes squint and bulge, they speak in low whispers, their veins pop out of their necks, and they fire their machine guns while shouting wordless, one-syllable screams like \\"ARRRRRRRGGGGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" and \\"UUUUAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\"  Is it kinda dumb?  Sure.  But who cares?  You're not watching this because it's great social commentary, you're watching it cause it's fun.  If you're looking for a good action movie full of big explosions and hilarious facial expressions, look no further.  Get it, you won't be disappointed.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I listen to this CD and I bought it because of paradise but it really is amazing. Overall I'd say good job!
B008JH5CVS|3.0|Really, this movie is more of a comedy than an action movie.  The main character is cracking jokes and doing one-liners all through the film.  Most of it's actually pretty funny.  Still, I kinda felt like he was lacking any real charisma.  The impression he gave me was, \\"Tony Stark's annoying little brother.\\"  But like I said, he was funny most of the time, so I really can't complain.  Then, there's the bad guy's brother who's pretty entertaining just cause he's so effing crazy.<br /><br />This movie goes way overboard on the CGI at times.  I don't have a problem with CGI, but dude, there's a limit.  Some scenes look like real people walking around in a PS2 game.  There's one part where they're diving down to Earth in these space suits, and I'm thinking, \\"How are they going to get through the atmosphere without blowing up?\\"  Their suits spark up a bit, then the flames die out and they keep falling.  So the atmosphere was pretty much like a firecracker that didn't quite go off.  I was like, \\"Dude, what the hell was that?!\\"<br /><br />Really, there's just not enough meat to the story.  It's basically \\"save the president's daughter in space.\\"  Some characters do some stuff and then the movie ends.  The bottom line is, it's an okay movie, but nothing to get excited about.  It's alright to rent if you just like to rent movies.  There's nothing really wrong with it, it's just that there's better movies out there.  That said, it's perfectly harmless fun.  If you're into these kinda movies and you're looking for something to watch over the weekend with some friends, this is something to consider.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I get to play tons of games and its free<br />I suggest that you get this app it is really good
B003O86FMW|3.0|It's hard to be a sequel.<br />After the fantastic Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins had to do something apparently impossible and try to make a second book that made justice to the first one. Well, she didn't.<br />It's not a bad read, by any means. It's just that, after reading the first book, this one leaves a lot to desire. Several plot points feel forced, there's lots of rushing, the pace is all over the place in some chapters... Yet, you must go through it in order to enjoy the great third book, Mockingjay.<br />So, read this one, take some notes and think like this: it's something you gotta endure to reach the great ending. It's worth the pain.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|this was my first  ebook. The download was fast and easy and the price was right. In general I still prefer real books as they require no batteries! But I wanted to try this to see how its works.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, I tried to find some of the books that shaped the \\"teenage arena\\" sub genre. In The Long Walk, Stephen King did many things way better than Collins, and this is a book you definitely should read. Garraty, the protagonist, is incredibly humane and tridimensional, a boy for whom we really root. Other characters are just as well drawn, some nice, some evil, some anonymous. The tension of the Long Walk (an event where 100 boys walk until only one is still alive) is palpable and every death makes you cringe, while some will sink your heart. There are stories of friendship, of love, of loyalty and a big thread of loss -- and bodies.<br />This goes though 99% of the book, then there's the ending.<br /><br />Man, does it suck!<br /><br />As far as I know King's work, he's really bad at endings (I mean, Dreamcatcher, anyone?), so I didn't have my hopes up. Well, it played as I expected. But the thing is, the rest of the book is so good, it all seems so possible in the reality TV dystopia we already live in, that one can go over the ending and pretend it just never happened.<br />I only wish there were fan fiction picking the ball where King left it fall.<br />And yes, it's way better than The Hunger Games -- except for the ending.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|A brilliant performance by Adele.  This was a performance by a Londoner in London for a London audience and as a Londoner I'm offended by those wanting to judge it with non London values. It's spot on and thoroughly enjoyable.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Cloud Atlas is like a maze of stories through which you travel alone, following a main character and a main theme. Part of the thrill is to discover how these stories are connected, and it's highly rewarding. As a bonus, this book has several separate books inside it, and it's worth rereading the chapters in different orders.<br />A word of caution: try to avoid reviews who delve too much into the plot. One of the biggest pleasures in Cloud Atlas is the sense of disorientation you feel as you travel through its many twists and turns. In the end, you'll feel the story coming full circle and will have a lot of things to digest and talk about.<br />A magnificent read.
0525953728|5.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" was an excellant book.  It showed you what Special Ops. go through to get the job done.  There was nothing in the book that revealed anything that would compromises their job (Special Ops.) ,it was a well written book that provided you an insight to what a lot of people don't understand.  It's a great book that I would highly recommend.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson tells in this biography a story of how the world we live in was shaped by a man. The works of Steve Jobs are all around us, some made by Apple, some heavily influenced by him. His personal life shows in many instances that, as any human being, Jobs had his flaws, but in the end he was just that: human.<br />Isaacson doesn't get it right every time (geeks will cringe whenever he starts delving too much in technology, since it's definitely not his area of expertise), but he does the job well overall. The highs and lows, the roller coaster life is, is well captured and there are several, several nuggets of fascinating information that we can't find elsewhere.<br />Jobs' story is one meant to be known. His vision shaped our world, so we might as well try to know more about the man.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Ordered this one after refusing to pay $45 for the rip-off official case.<br />Very happy with the purchase - It's well made and far easier to hold now.<br /><br />It needs to be open when charging, but that's no big deal.<br />The elastic strap is useful when folding the front cover all the way back behind the device.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ok, know this: if you love strong female protagonists, good world building, dystopic futures and thrills, you're gonna LOVE The Hunger Games. No wonder it's become such a success, both in books and movies.<br />Just do yourself a favor and don't watch the movie before reading this. The book is SO MUCH better: it has perfect pacing, great tension, lovely characters (except for Katniss: she's not lovely, not at all, she's badass!) and lots of memorable moments.<br />Pick this up and read it in one sitting. Oh, and one more thing: get snacks, because you're bound to get really hungry while you read. Believe me, I went through this twice.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An amazing account of what happened on the bin Ladin raid. If they end up prosecuting him for releasing no vital info on how spec ops go then they should throw the book at Obama for leaking info to make a movie!
B003X27L9U|4.0|This is the worst kind of terror: the one that feels common. The story in ROOM makes me shudder, and the way it is wold is even worse. Things we take for granted are snatched out of our hands and we are thrown in a hell where we feel as impotent and helpless as Jack, the little boy through whose eyes we see the Room.<br />Emma Donoghue did a great job writing this chilling story, even though here and there we can kinda see the seams in the world. Certain parts feel detached from the major theme and others sound rather too uncanny, but that's a minor blemish in a great literary work.<br />This is the kind of book that I hope will see a movie adaptation soon, but don't make the mistake of only going to the cinema when it eventually does: there's a great deal of feelings that only the written word can deliver.<br />And boy, does Donoghue deliver!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Great case very happy!  I would definitely buy another case from this vendor again.  Worth the while!  Very user friendly.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After more than a thousand pages, how do you let go of the world of Hunger Games? Like this.<br />Mockingjay is the final installment in the trilogy by Suzanne Collins and it really does justice to the story she built thus far. Here we see the final fights of Katniss Everdeen and everything comes to a great finale. There's lots of struggle and surprises, also the body count goes through the roof.<br />There's really no reason for anyone who've read the other two books not to pick this one up ASAP. Just... just make yourself a favor and find the time to finish it in one sitting, because you won't put this down until the very last page. Word to the wise: have food, water and tissues at hand (yes, I cried).
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I've always loved this story, ever since pre-K and I have to say this is definitely my favorite adaptation of The Lorax<br />I recommend this movie to everyone; young, old and everyone in-between~
B008M34INW|5.0|ok i was not sure about this movie seeing how it was a stright to dvd movie, but i loved it if u can forget all the crazy stuff hes done and just watch the movie you will like.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Kind of disappointed that Katniss isn't actually smart.<br /><br />She's just floating the wave. Trying very hard to protect her little boat without actually doing anything. Entertaining story however.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Glad they came out with this app because now I don't have to log in everytime and pinning is so much easier
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I've read every book in this series so far and love them all! Great writing, characters and story! A must read!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Addicted to this puzzling game. Just when you think you've got the hang of it, it gets tougher.  Get it!
B0098VYCCE|1.0|This movie was boring. She is a horrible actress. The movie drug on and I ended up not even finishing it. Blah.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Provided a decent overview of SEAL training and the peer pressure associated with being inside.  Good overview of the Bin Laden mission, and as he said, he tried to keep any classified info out of the book, e.g., dates are obscured so the actual time compression from notice to execution is not obvious.  Decent coverage, though.  If you've ever read Ben Schemmer's book, The Raid, which is about the Son Tay prison rescue attempt during the Vietnam War, I'd say No Easy Day falls short of in comparable details.  Recommend you read both, and The Raid is a 5 star non-fiction, IMO.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved it.....didnt want to stop playing. cant wait for the next one to come out or to download it. it is gonna be good
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty shades of grey is so unbelievably addictive!!! E.L James captures and creates a new way to enjoy a romance novel!!! This book is to die for!!!

B00973DDN2|4.0|I love this album. The killers have a very unique and complex sound. Every song has something exceptional about it. And Brandon's lyrics are amazing.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|This album has a real refreshing vibrant energy to it and is alive with creativity.  There is an interesting variety of styles and sounds to enjoy.  The songs are strong from the first to the last.  Thoroughly recommended.
B008HK3SO0|3.0|This case fits the Kindle Fire HD perfectly. My complaints are that it doesn't provide any padding for the device. Also if you're considering getting this product, you're going to definitely want to put a screen protector on your Fire. The inside of the case is pretty rough and I imagine that it would scratch your device's screen (I have a screen protector so I'm going off the feel of inside for that last statement.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to just put your Kindle Fire HD in, this is the perfect product. If you want something with padding and a soft inside, get something else.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This is an awesome movie. x-men 2 is alot better than 1. all of the actors are back as thier x-men characters and this movie introduces nightcrwaler. the actor who played nightcrwaler did a excellent job. this movie is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B007THA4FI|1.0|This is the first time that I have ever requested a refund for an ebook from Amazon. This book has so many characters, long back stories for everyone and is incredibly boring. I loved the Harry Potter books, but this was terrible.
B000AYELVA|5.0|This is an awesome movie. X-Men are so cool. the actors who played thier characters fit the part espicialy hugh jackman as wolverine and patrick stewart as professor x. and halle berry as storm. this is one of my favorite superhero films. this movie is astonishing. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B004LWZW8S|2.0|I think the title says it all.  The plot was lame and the film was shot so dark that it's difficult to make out a lot of the action.  If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother.  You didn't miss much.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|This is one of the best superhero movies of all time. superman is one of the greatest superheros. and christopher reeves plays him very well. and gene hackman as lex luthor was outstanding both actors are great at thier roles. superman is just awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0062502174|5.0|This book is the inspiration everyone needs input into their daily lives the wisdom the book posses is uncanny. Highly recommended for any type of reader you might be, consider this book a refreshment from all other books.
B000J10ERO|5.0|This is an awesome movie. i was kind of woried about this guy playing superman. but he did a good job. garantee he will be no christopher reeve but he did superman in his one way which was cool. i think brandon roth did the character justice and kevin spacy did an excelent lex luthor. this was a good fresh start on a new superman hopefully he will stick with it. one thing i did like about this movie was that it was a continuance not a remake or reboot. this is a awesome film. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B008XG1X18|4.0|Everything Pinterest is about, well packaged and delivered. It shows your notifications, your boards, pins, etc. The only tweak I'd recommend to happen is to let pins be shown from EVERYONE that you've followed or is following you, not just select few people. Other than that, a fantastic app, especially for Kindle Fires.
B000IJ79V6|5.0|This is an awesome movie. superman 2 leaves off of superman. christopher reeves is just as cool as he was in the first movie. superman 2 is a must see for all superman and superhero fans. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B0099G4Y26|5.0|P!nk really created the perfect album with The Truth About Love. Every song is flawless, and good for any type of mood you're in. Must be #1, soon.
6305903182|5.0|This is an awsome movie. scream 3 is pretty good all of the scream movies are. scream 3 completes the story. i liked how they kept all the original cast for the movie that was this movies best quality. all in all this movie was great. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
034580404X|1.0|I never even received this product. i would not recommend on purchasing products from this buyer. I was very disappointed.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Fantastic value for the complete box set of this classic TV series. Beautifully presented in a protective case includes all series and bonuses. Love it!
0385344333|2.0|Sorry to say, but I didn't like this book although I wanted to.  I feel that Lee is losing his touch, and perhaps it's because he's pretty much exhausted the Reacher story.  Reacher is so far off the grid and just can't exist in today's modern world.  He's an anachronism.  Lee's first books were exciting and different; there are enough of them already for us to savor and there's no need to continue with the same old story.  Also, Reacher's encyclopedic knowledge about everything is annoying since he's been out of the mainstream of military knowledge for so many years. He would have to be a constant scholar to stay abreast with present technology.  It's OK to keep the mind active but his knowledge boggles the mind and just isn't believable.  The story, at best, is mediocre.  The peripheral explanations of Reacher's knowledge is annoyingly distracting. I was glad to finish the book, but it was not a satisfying read.
B007P6VM04|3.0|I was hoping for more of the actual production numbers. It seemed more of a Katherine McPhee CD.  The History is Made at Night, I Wanna Be Your Star, and Mr and Mrs Smith were my favorites.  I would have liked to hear the \\"Bollywood\\" production and the song when Karen and Ivy are singing outside when they got drunk.  It was okay but not what I thought it would be.  More of a club music feel to the beginning of it.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|You will enjoy great music with a delightful accent!  This group is one not to be missed.  They have a great sense of humor, as well.
0345803485|1.0|The nitwit heroine of this book has turned blushing into a new language.  She blushes, flushes, reddens and her cheeks become red on almost every page. She doesn't really need to talk to express her feelings. She just exhiblts different shades of facial redness. The writing is unbelievably repetitive.  The characters are ridiculous. The girl isn't really into beatings, restraints, etc. but goes along with it because Mr. Grey is so hot and a billionaire.  Save your money.
B00881VLCE|1.0|very limited on puzzles - good pictures, just not enough to choose from.  Also would like to see different levels from easy to advanced.
B005FITIDC|5.0|This movie is awesome! I just watched it on Netflix today and loved it. Of course I cried and I cheered! There are so many emotions for this movie. And knowing it's a true story with some one out there like that helping makes it all the better. I wish they took some of the proceeds from the movie and gave to the Sam Childer's orphanage. I mean they may have, I don't know. I'm also glad they gave info where we can go to help. It's great when your wanting more than anything to be able to help hands on and can't due to disabilities to have a place to go online and help in other ways! This movie is very eye opening and heart felt! I highly recommend!
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great app the only thing I dont like is the pinterest decal does not show up on my app page.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like the game but my money on my kindle is out so I can't buy it so please make a demo
B008RV5K4U|2.0|I was never a huge Batman fan until I read this graphic novel series - I read the series the day before the first Batman movie with Micheal Keaton came out.<br /><br />After reading the book, I very much wanted to see a very dark, serious Batman. Obviously, thats not what any of the original Batman movies were about until Chris Nolan started directing them.<br /><br />Ive never been into watching this cartoon series either, as the style is just to casual for Batman for my taste.<br /><br />In a world of Toy Storys, I just cant watch minimal animation techniques where only mouths move when speaking and animation is conservative. This isnt 1970 Speed Racer...this technique just does not convey the character emotions that animation could bring to this story using modern techniques.<br /><br />That said, I gave it a shot, and watched about 15 minutes. It depressed me similarly to the way the first Michael Keaton Batman movie depressed me. Just not the way I would personally like to see this story introduced to moviegoers who havent read the story.
B004EYSXT8|5.0|This book provides a valuable insight as to why practice is important to good performance. It also shows why only perfect practice makes perfect. Excellent reading for any coach or for a parent wanting to guide their kids practice/study.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I have already seen this film. Now i own  a copy. I love this film. I just love it. I seen this movie at least 50 times and always find something new. It is just one of those movies you cant get out of your head. It is a true classic film.A+ for the film and A+ to Amazon.com for offering it.. Just the best.....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved Bared to You and couldn't wait for Reflected in You! Had my emotions all over the place! Loved the drama! You also felt like the characters were real, normal, every day people struggling with every day issues like the rest of us. For those that relate this to Fifty Shades couldn't be more wrong ... both great reads, but entirely different. Anxious for the next book! In the mean time I plan to read more of Sylvia's books!
B00003CX8N|5.0|I have loved this film for years/ Being a book lover it was my kind of film.I wore out my VSH copy so got this DVD. I love any film with Anthony Hopkins in it. And here he shows his true acting and it is A +.It is true they didnt put alot of money into this film as can be seen with that awful wig they used on Bancroft head at the begining of the film. But when  they come together it is magic. You will notice a younger Judi Dench as the wife, another wonderful actor.I always say i have a top ten list of favorite movies and this one is on it..This film is for anyone who loves books and love to read... A+  Thank Amazon.com for carrying  it...You always have what i want.Thanks
B005NNJL0O|1.0|There is a good-quality dvd of Melody Nelson in existence somewhere in the world, France for sure. It's not in this set. The dvd is a documentary. The company that supplies this set must have decided that we foolish Americans cannot see Gainsbourg's masterpiece.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Being a man I found this movie interesting. But more so the music in the movie ,as i grew up during the time it was popular. I think this movie with all these A+ actors could have been great. But i dont  know something is lacking. Roberts doesnt seem to know what to do with the part. And although most of the young women  in the flim are great It is still lacking when it comes to good acting. This could have been a classic movie , but the acting shot it down to the B- level.I keep thinking of Good Bye Mr Chips, the old one.... This could have match that and been best picture of the year , but couldnt because of  the bad acting & lack of direction.Anyway it is a good movie to watch...And does give you an ideal what things were like way back when..<br />B- from me . I hope others like it better.
B004QWZ92W|2.0|\\"On the Origin of Species\\" is as groundbreaking today as it was when it was first published, and it's so eminently readable that will become a favorite (if you're willing to give it a chance). I love and admire the book - but I'm not so thrilled about the \\"Illustrated Classics\\" version.<br /><br />Several book publishers have approached this book with fresh eyes (most recently, David Quammen). The approach makes perfect sense: take Darwin's text, and add illustrations that demonstrate Darwin's ideas in a visual format hat the author could only imagine. The disadvantage with this, of course, is that you may come closer to a coffee table book than anything else. But the \\"Illustrated Classics\\" version contains some period pictures, biological illustrations, and the like in something that comes closer to a mixed salad than a meal. For such a great price, it's a pretty good bargain; but this gathers together a variety of inexpensive and public access images that's more appealing than raw text - but some readers may want more.<br /><br />I love \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" but I only wish the \\"Illustrated Classics\\" version could be more compelling.

B007TBZ63Y|1.0|I use my phone as my e-reader for convenience; Carrying my phone around is much easier than a kindle or an iPad.  That being said, I have read many books on my phone, and have had not one problem.  this particular  (book) was freezing earlier today, and now, it crashes entirely, taking me back to the last title that I had been reading.  I find this very upsetting because I have been waiting on pins and needles for this book, and now that I am roughly halfway through it, I can't read it! Please fix this as soon as possible! Beyond the technical issues, I have enjoyed what I have read so far. which make it doubly frustrating.  If this is what I can expect to happen with ebooks, I think I may return to hard copies of books.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|A quick read. Story is not very intriguing or thought provoking. I suppose it makes you think about the meaning of life - if you didn‘t already know.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a very gratifying book I would recommend this to most anyone I'm sad that it's over leaves me wanting more. I felt an almost need to be closer to the characters somehow wanting to be closer to him and want to be her.
B0089BSM70|5.0|This is a review of the overall content itself and NOT the movie. As we all know, Halloween II is a perfect sequel.<br /><br />Halloween II is my favorite (aside from the obvious original) and I was very excited about getting some special features for this installment. The fact that the TV version is included as an official release, warrants the purchase alone. The feature on the making of the film, trailers, TV spots, and stills is what we Halloween fans have all been waiting to see for an HII release. And as an avid Halloween fan, I am greatly please with what Shout! Factory has brought us. On a final note, the transfer (picture) quality is much cleaner than Universal's \\"30th Ann.\\" release. This is definitelt worth the pick up.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A great read. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I've been a fan ever since \\"Pillars\\" and this is one of my favourites so far. Can't wait for the next instalment.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The chapters that discussed the UBL raid were insightful and honest; I think it was important that the story be told and genuinely appreciated the author's perspective. Unfortunately, I was less interested in the life of SEALs and found the first chapters less interesting.

B005HJWWW8|2.0|The biggest problem I have with this product is that the output volume isn't significantly louder than the volume you get from the 3.5mm jack in whatever device you are using in the first place. You would think that the amplifier would \\"amplify\\" the sound. It works well for my application but again the volume could be louder. I use it in order to listen to the output of a UHF wireless microphone system to be able to monitor a recording live.

B001NCQSDM|5.0|In late 1968 I had the privilege of attending Cream's final US performance in Providence, RI. I was 17 and totally in awe of this magnificent band. The power that these 3 skinny Brits unleashed onstage was astonishing. And the knowledge that they were breaking up made the concert a bittersweet event.<br /><br />When \\"Goodbye\\" was released it was a blessing to us Cream-heads who had only 3 albums  to get us through the rest of our lives and I, for one, was ecstatic. It was not their best LP, but it had plenty of fine stuff. The live tunes (especially \\"I'm So Glad\\")displayed the power that I witnessed that night and the studio ones were excellent examples of the psychedelically quirky tunes that they were so good at. For anyone new to Cream I would recommend starting from the beginning with \\"Fresh Cream\\" but \\"Goodbye\\" is also a mighty fine album.
1400032717|5.0|Author Mark Haddon's past experience with autistic individuals gives structure, consistency, and sympathy to his portrayal of his main character, Christopher. The book is beautifully written, and the author deftly weaves the seemingly simple with the more complex. Even though Christopher's worldview is not one that most of us share, Haddon does a great job of providing a window onto some of the possible thoughts and feelings of autism. Christopher makes a very unique and likable protagonist, with his powers of observation, his methods of self-calming, his aversion to lying, and his attempts to navigate the sometimes painful complications of human interaction. I found this to be a truly memorable book.

0316228532|2.0|There have been many eloquent reviews already which echo my thoughts on this book.  I was not expecting a rehash of Harry Potter, was forewarned it was for adults and had few expectations.  However, I would have put this book down several times out of disgust and boredom, had I not hoped that somewhere, somehow, a little bit of redemption would be present.  I wish I had put it down at some point rather than force myself to keep reading.  Glad I had it from the library.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|This movie was very well done, and is still my favorite movie. Mark whalberg fires on all cylinders as he did a great job researching what a marine scout sniper would do in a desperate situation.
B005SCSL56|4.0|An amazing book written by one so young.  I found it a fast and fun read as did my grandkids.  He took us to a place fairy tales do not usually go. Very entertaining.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I'm a big fan of this app, but it still has some shortcomings that just drive me up the walls:<br /><br />1. Sorting. \\"The Beatles\\" should not be sorted under the letter \\"T.\\" The sorting works fine in the iOS version, but for some reason, on Android, it's a mess.<br /><br />2. When opening the app, it should default to \\"Artists\\" not albums. It's logical for people to think, \\"oh, I feel like listening to [artist]\\" rather than thinking of an album first. It's one extra click, but it's a fairly obvious thing. And this is something that only recently changed, it used to work just fine.<br /><br />3. Random songs on my cloud drive just won't appear on the mobile app. Haven't figured out what causes this to happen. Sometimes deleting and re-uploading the track works, other times the missing song might just randomly reappear. Whatever causes this needs to be resolved.<br /><br />4. User's should be allowed to shut off \\"Upgraded Audio.\\" Great, so I rip my MP3's at 256 to 320kbps (VBR) using the LAME MP3 encoder, and Amazon tells me that they're \\"upgrading\\" my audio to 256kpbs? Last I checked, 256kbps was of a lower quality than 320kpbs.<br /><br />5. Could use an editable EQ. Currently it has presets you can cycle through, but I'd like the ability to edit the EQ settings myself.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Really enjoyable game. As with all of the glu mobile games you will need to use coins for certain upgrades and items which you can buy or earn through playing. Its not too much of an annoyance since playing the game is a blast. Definitely download this app.
B007Z9QS5K|4.0|Just a fun movie with lots of feelings.....Something the whole family can watch and laugh and cry with and enjoy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am nearing the end of this second book in the series - I love it!  The writing from Anastasia's \\"mind\\" adds a lot of humor to a sometimes dark story.  I have really enjoyed seeing how Christian is evolving into a good man with the love of Ana.  After being just dumped at the end of book 1, with memories of bad, this one is refreshing.  Can't wait to get to book 3 - except I don't want this to ever end!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its an ok game. hard to get the pieces to unlock puzzles sometimes. would be better if there was easier way to unlock games or puzzles or whatever they are
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This second book in the Crossfire Trilogy was not at all what was anticipated. Granted there was a lot of sensuously passionate sex and an unbelievably addictive, explosive relationship between Gideon and Eva as was in the first book, but the ultimate climax of the story was the heart and soul for one incredibly essential element that will truly bind the relationship...trust.<br /><br />Although the love they demonstrated throughout the narrative was so overpowering, there is a wonderfully brilliant twist that seals their love in its entirety. This leads in to the magnitude of the story--unconditional love. I didn't foresee where the story was going but I really appreciated the mystery and anticipation of where the journey was taking me. The genuine love two people could ever possibly have was breathtakingly portrayed and was incredibly illustrated in the outcome (the last couple pages are powerful)...the most beautifully-written, all-embracing, heartfelt story of love ever imaginable. The entire story is embedded in Gideon's words early on: \\"I'd kill for you, give up everything I own for you.  .  . but I won't give you up.\\"<br /><br />Brilliantly written, exceptional characters, extraordinary premise, and an overall breathtakingly beautiful story of love...obsessively intoxicating read! Highly recommend!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|only problem I have is the game keeps resetting after I get to level 44,  then starts back at level 1.  Hard to get coins as well
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I loved the music. It brought me back to the amazing concert I attended of Hugh Laurie. One thing I didn't like was some of the songs on the cd didn't aline with the cd jacket's list of songs. So I didn't know which song would play next.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book was such trash it's hard to describe! I felt like I was reading some seedy, salacious, poorly written diary or something! UGH- a total waste of my time!!!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Works well on the fire, except vids don't seem to play correctly from youtube from certain sites unless you go to the webpage.
1423140605|3.0|Okay...don't get me wrong...  The book is good...but even with the cliffhanger I'm not that excited for the next book because I feel sort of let down by the last-minute-save that always seems to happen in all Riordan's books.  I have a feeling even their new deadline will still be another that comes down to the wire.  The good old \\"we have X number of days but we'll not get it done till the last possible second\\" scenario is getting tiring.  Can't they come in and save the day before the countdown reaches 1 second left?  They need a little more breathing room!
B000ICXQF6|5.0|One of the all time best time travel movies. Terry Gilliam's finest production.  Acting is great with a killer ending.
0525953728|4.0|Amazing firsthand story and explaining of an entire event, the larger view showing scope of the war. Kept me on the edge wanting to read the next page, extremely interesting and he goes into detail in which a 5th grader could understand.
B008RV5K5E|3.0|I purchased the blu-ray version, the picture was very clear, great to look at! Sound clear and crisp, all the better to hear the movies fantastic soundtrack. So why only 3 stars?<br /><br />The voice acting was hit and miss, Peter Weller did a very good job as Batsman, I would say that the main characters were good, the surrounding  characters were more like who they could find the read the script. There was very little emotional impact to be from the  supporting characters to me.<br /><br />The animation was what you could find on any of the current DC shows now on TV. I could Bothell be feel a little cheated that the Frank  Miller cutting edge novel was just not there. The story was very true to the book,  but  I wonder how well the novel would''ve done, with  Archie comics drawing? The other thing that bothered me  it seemed they  could not make up their minds whether to make this as aother DC show, or go for more adult content. Basically with very little edit, it could  make the Saturday morning cartoon line-up.<br /><br />I liked it, but could''ve been so much more.
B0054TVW04|5.0|Civilization:  The west and the Rest is a broad historical survey that covers the key factors and developments that contributed to the rise of Western Civilization generally.  It is well written, well researched, and bravely affirmative of the value of Western Civilization in general.<br /><br />Some criticize the book for its failure to go deep into the many topics it must touch to deliver its thesis.  This is silly - the History of western Civilization is taught in colleges as a year long course, and even that is just a survey!  Others call the book racist.  This is also silly - Western institutions have helped shape the world, from the business suit to human rights.  Ironically, the rejection of racism is a (recent and attained at great cost) product of Western Civilization.  Some say the book ignores the failures of Western Civilization.  This is simply untrue and the comment suggests the reviewer did not read the book.  These attacks you can safely ignore.<br /><br />This is an interesting, insightful, and thought provoking work of popular history.  It is not a college course, but it would be an excellent text to assign in one.  It is written in Mr. Ferguson's usual, highly readable style.  It is clear and fun to read.  It offers insights and explanations, generally very convincing, that can change your world view.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a well written popular history text with more than its share of insights.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Never liked noise machines &amp; most &quot;nature&quot; players were too scratchy or fake. I downloaded the free version of relax melodies and loved it so much I actually bought the premium version! worth every penny! Love the ability to not only mix my own sounds but also the ability to vary the volume of each individual sound. The best addition is the added decibals for relaxation &amp; sleep. Also on my kindle fire it plays in background &amp; has a timer that works with the screen off.

B0031ESIZQ|1.0|I bought RC Tycoon 3 for my wife's use.  She has played through all of the levels of the original RC Tycoon, but she couldn't even get started with RCT3.  The original is complex, but RCT3 is ridiculous.

1594484805|4.0|Drive looks under the hood of motivation. The author narrows it down to three things:<br />Autonomy: People want to have control over their work and the decisions that affect their work.<br /><br />Mastery: People want to get better at what they do and to use their brilliance in the workplace.<br /><br />Purpose: People want to be part of something that is bigger than they are and to know the big vision which is sometimes hidden from their view.<br /><br />With employee engagement reported at 29% in the US it is time we looked under the hood of motivation and determined that how we've been \\"doing\\" leadership does not work. The book outlines how people tick which might provide insight to leaders and reinforces what that the workforce demands more than a paycheck from their work. I did like how the book is summarized for quick reference in the back and it offer some inquires for leaders to ponder about their own leadership, motivations and their own drive in the workplace.[...]

034580404X|3.0|I did it, I completed the trilogy. Without giving away the story I was impressed that the main character made her choices about her career, her future and her own finances, she was able to do what most women struggle with, balance work and relationships and take time for herself and self care somewhere in between while exposure male vulnerability from a strong male. Taking a corner office when not quite ready is a bold move that more women can make and setting boundaries and safety words in their relationships keeps them in charge too. This series made for an interesting reflection on women and the popularity of the book series leaves one intrigued. Cheers to writing a series that flowed from one book to another with ease and reached a stage of completion that seemed just right.  [...]
0439023513|2.0|I think Suzanne Collins must have been very tired about writing these characters and couldn't write herself out of the holes she made, because besides making Katniss shell-shocked and hopeless, the character at the core didn't change much.  She didn't learn how to express her emotions, she didn't become \\"better\\".  She didn't grow. The internal struggles she feels never make it to the surface.  She doesn't change her reckless behavior patterns.  Instead, she is targeted and manipulated so that the rebel (District 13) cause can capitalize on her very predictable impulses and her celebrity/sentimental appeal.  She was still very self-centered and brusque at the end of the series--even moreso than in books 1 & 2.  Yes, she likes to \\"save people\\" but when she has to \\"deal with people\\" Katniss has zero skills.  She had some good moments in book 1 and 2, so book 3 largely depends on that previous attachment for her as she was in her best moments, much like the Mockingjay persona/symbol does for the rebels, she is romantized and idealized by the rebels, the districts, and the two love interests. However, she doesn't show any winning qualities in book 3.  It's just really frustrating to read her interactions and dialogues with other characters. Never, never, does she do anything but repeat the SAME banal thoughts HUNDREDS of times.  Always torn between the same feelings since book 1.  The same so-called \\"realizations\\" over about Petta, Gale, and Haymitch, etc.-- she is the see-saw girl--always going back and forth and cannot make a rational decision and just stick with it.  Selfish too.  Really, she couldn't choose between the guys until the choice was made for her?  It's just so weak.  Sure, Katniss figures out plot points (she has to of course to keep the plot moving since she's the narrator), but the girl never does anything mature in her interactions with others, especially with Peeta and Gale.  She's grown up enough to shoot arrows at hovercraft, but not to just say what she means and feels, even to her mother? She also treats both Peeta and Gale so badly, worsening throughout book 3, it's hard to keep liking her or to root for her romance to succeed.  By the end I like none of them and don't want any of them together in any combination.  Colllins completely destroys both Peeta and Gale irrevocably. She kills off any great character, either with a death or a death of personality.  Why did I get into these books? The ending is disappointing, depressing, and leaves you feeling hollow.<br /><br />There were many holes and gaps in the story and plot that added up to lazy writing.  I'm not going to point it all out here, because it's too much to write.  Collins skips major sections of the war and aftermath in Mockingjay--I'll just say that.  Really, there should have been another 100 pages at least.  After reading all the series, Collins doesn't even bother to tell you how the government turns out!  Did it work?  Is it better?  By the way Katniss acts, it sure seems like it's all just as bad as when you read the first page of the series.  She really doesn't even transform the characters, show them overcoming their emotional and mental difficulties/trauma, the way many veterans do (just look at many WW2 vets who mostly cherished and led decent lives).  She bothers to show you 20 years ahead, but it's just as bleak as 21 years ago.  Collins instead takes away any of the qualities that you originally liked about her characters, and so by the time the book ends, who cares? SPOILER AHEAD: I mean, she burns Katniss alive 40 pages before the ending? Stops the action before President Snow is seized? We never even see Snow killed. Also, the whole assassination platoon move gets characters killed and yields NO results, which really makes you dislike Katniss more since other likable characters were thus pointlessly killed. Really Collins?? Boy, you ARE a tease AND a KILLJOY.<br /><br />Gale is unforgivable (because of the part he plays in the tragedy), Peeta is a nasty jerk (nothing like before), Katniss is really egotistical, depressing, and rendered useless and mutilated by shock and PTSD. Ugh. I know it's not going to be rosy, but finish the story and show the truth--from war comes recovery too, healing, etc. SOMETHING.<br /><br />The deaths of Snow and Coin aren't even explored in the book at all--what was the result?  No Information from lazy S. Collins.  Sorry folks!  You know that war she made you care about?  She won't even tell us what the outcome was!  Seriously??  \\"Mockingjay\\" is a true BUMMER and like me, it will probably make you mad.  I'm not saying Collins is talentless and didn't have some good ideas, but she does those ideas and characters grave injustice by leaving most of the story untold and making bad plot choices, especially at the end. I literally flung the book at the wall.
1591391105|5.0|This book offers the how to information new leaders need to put themselves into the respected position of leader as well as to bring out the best in expediting the potential in each individual and in the highest team performance.

The common problems of new leadership are addressed such as becoming the leader of former peers, taking on leadership of others and bridging generational gaps, being fearless as a leader and making key moves in the first 90 days to build the trust in the organization that you are indeed a leader. I am recommending this book to a new leader next week and asking them to take the action steps noted.

It certainly takes an interesting path, taking the reader on a journey similar to scenes from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I began to ponder the interest of women in reading and recommending the book to others. This first one was an eye opener and I'm holding out my vote until I keep on reading. I marvel that the author had such descriptive writing that was waiting to be birthed and give her credit for stepping out on center stage with something new and different. [...]

0071636080|5.0|My review is a bit different than some of the others. I really liked this book and am using it as my guide for developing engaging presentations based on what Steve Jobs did so well, provide great stories and repeatable sound bites that helped to position his products and his company to be the best. Known for his famous \\"put a dent in the universe\\" and Stanford University's Connect the dots speech, this book takes the prize in media coaching in understanding how powerful messages can be heard with the fewest of words and how words can drive emotion. I liked  how the author looked at various speeches as well as marketing presentations and took them apart to dissect the golden nuggets. I am pulling it from my shelf as as I prepare for an upcoming speech. I think it is a book that should be introduced to all business communication and public speaking classes to illustrate how less is sometimes so much more. [...]
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good game a lot more fun than I thought it would be but pretty darn addictive I would definately recommend it
0316228532|5.0|Wow. Just wow! One of the grittiest and most intelligent human character studies I've read in a long time.<br /><br />There aren't many places I can look to find so many richly explored characters that I can care about, love, hate, pity, respect, ridicule, identify with, hate some more, despise, and forgive(you really have to be able to keep up). The humanity of all of these characters (and each of us as people?) is thrown into such sharp relief that it becomes almost too painful/uncomfortable/ugly/horrific to \\"look\\" at, but I could NOT stop reading. (Like the train wreck that you know is about to happen, but you just can't look away)! It broke my heart. It made me miserable. I felt despondent - like I just wanted all the inhumanity to just STOP and leave me be - but I pressed on and read on and I walked away feeling more alive (or at least more aware of the fact that I was alive and glad for it) and like I'd learned something about myself and those around me (the characters were about as unlikeable as the rest of us can be. Like many of the characters, we all have one version of ourselves that we present to the world and another (sometimes darker) self that may be tucked away inside of us but really runs the show. Likely few of us have inner selves quite as malicious, as self loathing, or, cowardly as some of the folks in Pagford - but we all know at least one person who is. We all also know a Barry Fairbrother - the everyguy/girl who helps everyone else even attempt tolerate each other and whom our entire social realities would be doomed without).<br /><br />I think Jo told a real, harsh, **expertly** written story with no happily ever after endings, but with a bit of redemption for a few characters. She wrote about real life. Some of us don't like this kind of storytelling. I, personally, find it reaffirming.<br /><br />I can count on one hand how many books have been able to move me to tears, three of them now are by JKR (including Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows). I grew up with, cherish, and have dedicated a portion of my life to the HP series and now my children are taking up the reigns! But Harry Potter this book most certainly is NOT (anyone hoping to find even a semblance of it here has surely been ill advised to do so), but, in the real world, magic doesn't happen with wands - it happens through the transfiguration of the human spirit. I'm charmed! ;-)Hallows). I grew up with, cherish, and have dedicated a portion of my life to the HP series and now my children are taking up the reigns!

B004UID2LC|1.0|this piece of crap doesn't work. I deleted it right after I downloaded it now I cant listen to free music on my kindle.
B005721W9O|5.0|Galaxy Quest is one of my favorite parody movies of all time!  Each cast member does a phenomenal job, especially Tony Shalhoub.  I didn't feel I needed blue-ray for this one, so for the price, how can you not add this DVD to your collection?
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game isn't too bad. I like the way the rooms change. However I don't like how you can get stuck waiting to play. You should be able to explore rooms as often as you want.
B008NW67E0|5.0|First of all, there are some awesome songs on this album! My favs are: I Will Wait, Babel, Not With Haste and The Boxer.  If you saw the movie Brave, part of the lyrics from Not With Haste were used in the song Learn Me Right (a great song on its own), which was a collaboration between Birdie and Mumford and Sons.  In my opinion, some of the songs in the middle of the album like Broken Crown and Hopeless Wanderer, were not that great (some were too slow for me, others I didn't care for the lyrics).  Least fav. was Broken Crown (I didn't like the lyrics).  One of the main critiques about this album that I've seen is that this sounded too much like Sigh no more.  Guess what, I liked that album! So, that critique doesn't really gain traction with me.  Overall, this a great album and I'm glad I bought it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once I started reading the Hunger Games, I was addicted. As the last book, I felt a feeling of excitement to finally know what would happen to the characters, but was sad to know the story ended once I finished this book. I would highly recommend this series. When I finished this story, I felt as though I was leaving part of me behind. It's a great series and keeps you wanting to know what comes next.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|I watched an episode a few months ago on tv and I loved it so much I had to buy the first 3 seasons. When I finished those I couldn't find season 4 in the stores so I ordered it off amazon. I'm absolutely hooked! I don't want it to end! I think I seen the complete season 5 here on amazon & if so, I'm definitely ordering it! FYI---This is not a show for young kids-
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Got the video very quickly no issues at all. Will buy again from this vendor.the three disk set lets me enjoy this anywhere.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|One of the reasons why I bought this was because I was on a budget and wanted to save some money on the video card. All I can say about the HD 4000 is wow. It wont max games out but it will play any game on the market. Shadows is what really kills the fps turn them off and I can run crysis on very high at 1680x1050 with shadows turned off and it runs great. Same with skyrim with the 2k texture pack. I might not even buy a graphics card now. Haven't overclocked yet. Would highly recomend to any gamer on a budget.<br />Asus PZ77-V Pro Mobo<br />8 GB Corsair Vengeance Ram (doesn't overclock very good)<br />WD 320 HD (Only way to go if your buying a regular HD)
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book is a must read.  You don't need to have any particular interest in Apple or its products.  This is just an amazing & well written biography of a very complex human being.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I had read all the books in this series and the movie followed the books very well. It is a story that could happen.
B005LAIHGI|1.0|Mister Cohen: The joke is on you. You think you're funny, the rest of us do not. Your stupid stunts to promote this film and your other films are desperate attempts to bring attention to yourself. YOU are simply one of the worst comedians of this century. Maybe of all time. Maybe in this universe. This film couldn't be funny if one snorted laughing gas. It wouldn't be funny if it had a laugh track, or an appearance by a 1950's Jerry Lewis. It simply reeks of crass commercialism and stupid writing. There, is that clear now? Take the money you've made on your previous stinkers and ride off into the sunset.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved 50 Shades.  Took some time to get into Bared To You but Reflected In You had more content and kept me interested. There was more of a plot and better overall writing.  Ready for book 3.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a fantastic app!  Haven't had an issue with bugs.<br />One thing that I love is that the music is continuous, not recorded and replays itself!<br />Love that you can pick and chose what exactly you would like to hear and mix the sounds.<br />Perfect for an ongoing mind that needs to relax!
B008XG1X18|5.0|would recommend love this app. it works great on my Kendal fire. I'm addicted to this app so many great ideas on here
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Could not be better. Anything to go after our prexy. Loved his contridictions re what we had heard prior to book
1439102430|2.0|Just boring. I gave it 2 stars because I actually finished this. I read the new Lee Child book, A Wanted Man, right before this one and I have to say that with both of these books it seemed like the authors just phoned them in, or had someone else do it for them. Bones are Forever started with a promising premise but then rambled off into scuzzy, unremarkable characters, diamond mining, and a incoherent setting. None of the main characters seemed to like eachother at all and the constant sniping or cold shoulders just left me rolling my eyes. Skip this one.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is pretty good.  some slight issues with timing issues,  on some of the levels.  The game concept is cool better then normal catapult games.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|Received the DVD in super fast time and was in new condition.<br />I will buy from this seller again.<br /><br />Action movie but, I did not care for the story line of kids<br />killing kids for entertainment of a group of future people.<br /><br />The actors did a good job of acting in the movie.<br /><br />I will review the DVD that I am buying in the future.<br />My rating is on the movie not the seller who was great 5 star.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Needed it for a hypnosis track I needed to download to my laptop as well as my tablet and it works great.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|If you liked the previous 16 and are prepared to overlook a few unlikely story twists and turns, and enjoy a rollicking good read, then get it and read. Otherwise don't!
B008N1V11U|3.0|I would like to start by saying it is about time this game was made avalible for the the Kindle HD. This is a a 5 star quality game but I will not give any Gameloft games 5 stars until they put full support into the kindle fire HD. It makes no since to only have these games avalible for the old kindle when it doesnt even have enough space.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I just bought this product after reading many reviews on different headsets. I've personally owned 5 or 6 different brands over the years, always in the mid-range for cost.<br />The difference in this product is just amazing. All I did was install the drivers and right away the sounds from a game I've been playing for over 2 years just leap out of the game like never before. The surround sound is great, and the weapons clashing give a very satisfying CRUNCH that wasn't there before. The microphone voice quality is superb right out of the box. I didn't have to do any tweaking. Love this headset :)
B0086700CM|4.0|I thought it was a fun app and it is really addictive. it is s good buy. I highly recommend it cud its free
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the ability to down load multiple versions of the bible. In addition, the fact that the notes can be listed as public so they can be shared with others is awesome. You have different interpretation of the same scripture at your finger tips.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book makes me proud to serve my country. It also really sheds some truth on how the federal government inter-twines with our military.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|the game only has 1 race.  you have to buy the whole game and it wasn't even much fun. it just takes up space.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Another good book by Ken Follet, couldn't put it down. It did drag on towards the end and I kept waiting for something more to happen.
B008G12ERC|5.0|\\"The 2nd Law\\" is great! This is another great rock album from Muse. It is one of the best rock albums of the year.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|All in all, this was a good read. As usual, lots of humor as well as decent writing. But I think there were just too many characters to fully represent them all. Gonna quote one of the characters here, There's a reason there are usually only three people on a quest... With all the important characters in the story, some of them aren't really coming across as 3-dimensional. Hopefully a challenge Riordan can overcome in the future.<br /><br />What saddens me is that I want to read it again, yet I can't because for whatever reason, the book is simply refusing to be opened on m kindle touch. I have tried sending it to archived items and redownloaded it at least twenty times now T.T Am kinda at my wit's end here.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I enjoyed the book Delirium.  I especially enjoyed that it was delivered wirelessly to my Kindle  and I was able to begin enjoying it right away.  The book is a good read.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well written account considering the limitations placed on the author for security reasons. It provides a brief narrative on the training and exploits leading up to the take down of UBL. Considering all the security leaks from the WH that could very well impact other missions as well as placing those who serve in danger, there were no secrets, confidential methods or documents exposed by the author.  Only reason I can see for all the hoopla stirred up by the DOD, was possibly the last chapter where innuendo of the teams opinion of the present administration was less than flattering.  Good reading, difficult to put book down till finished.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. I read Bared to You and I couldn't wait to start reading this one.  I read the 50 Shades Trilogy and I have to admit I loved it too.  But something about Gideon and Eva has me hooked.  I'm not one to wish time away but December can't come soon enough.<br /><br />Everyone is pushing for a 50 Shades movie.  Well I personally would love to see Gideon and Eva transpire on screen.  Their story is much better then Christian and Ana's. Even the supporting cast of characters are intriguing <br /><br />For those who loved 50 Shades, you will love this story too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a lot of fun for all ages! It takes me back to when I used to play in the arcades.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The thought of what if is always something to be contemplated. Every person in the world whether they have children or don't. Have love for children as a whole. This book shows you what can happen when people are subservient and aren't willing to fight back because you have family.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Ultraviolet does not work well and not worth anyone's time or money.  I will change my review for this product when there is an itunes digital copy included.
B00005JO5L|3.0|I wanted to have this unusual film in my library at home in order to be able to watch it when I felt the urge to be watching something so dark and bleak; it does sort of place the notion of serial killers and gay men in the same story for whatever reason, and that is an interesting combination. I also really like to listen to a good directors commentary. This one is not so great unfortunately. I have interviewed William Friedkin face to face in the past, and am a little fascinated by his choices as a director. He likes to stick with the gritty crime drama a lot of the time and he's quite accomplished at the genre, but he slips over into other material such as 'Boys In The Band' and 'The Exorcist'. When he deviates over to these other genre films - genre as in - horror and gay film - he tends to bring some of his action drama gritty crime film-effects with him. Listening to the commentary here I started to wonder what the point of it really was; I didn't get a great deal of information from it at all, I'm afraid, but it did start me to wondering about the director's vision in relation to his other films. I am now wondering if the good director has started a chain reaction in my imagination linking the evil spirit in Regan's life into the murders that go on around and about the meat packing district in 'Cruising'. After all - the same voice coming from a variety of men... and other strange revelations William makes during the commentary really does push this film into the super natural. It is a strange and alienating film on many levels, not the least level being the one where you share the viewing with the director himself - who seeks not to answer questions, but to pose them. I understand why there was some outrage at the film when it was released, after all it doesn't read very clearly as to what it is saying, and with Friedkin suggesting one victim is the next killer or one killer is the next victim, he really does open a can of worms around the subtext. When I first saw the film in the early 1980s I was shocked by the brutality of it - now I see it as less brutal, and more sinister than ever. It tells the story of a cop who goes under cover to find a murderer - he acts as bait - and he does eventually pull a killer out of a sub-cultural group he is playing bait for.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The final half of the book gives the reader the clearest picture of what went down with the OBL mission.  I'd like to thank the author for proving us with a history told in an enthralling manner.  And not one macho \\"hoo rah\\" in the whole book!  In military parlance, \\"well done.\\"  BTW, I did not find this to be \\"political\\" though he scarcely gave the president credit for undertaking what proved to be a very dicey operation.  He was critical that any hesitation occurred which illustrates his limited world view.
B0074Y2YZ4|5.0|A must have for Roxette fans!!! Very much in the same vein as their Touring album. I loved it...but I love ALL of Roxette's albums...does'nt everyone???L.O.L.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I would tell someone new to re-read Bared to You prior to reading this book. While Bared to You seemed similar to 50 Shades, Reflected in You illustrates very clearly that it is not. This is a very different book. This is a book about two abused individuals trying to find a \\"normal\\" and perhaps failing. In Bared to You, Eva seems normal but in Reflected in You, she is very much desperate, clingy and needy. It makes you think \\"HOT MESS\\". Gideon is really not there or you are not clear of his purpose for most of this book.  Without giving too much away, it ends with you knowing that he has a very extreme set of values.  I am not sure what Entwined with You, the sequel,  will be. This book kind of seemed like an end to a distracting story of love.
1601253788|3.0|When you get to bestiary 3, things start to get weird.<br /><br />Paizo managed to keep it together and present interesting monsters for PCs to fight.<br /><br />Overal, a good book. I WOULD give it 3.5 stars if I could!

B009AJDDQU|5.0|I love this movie!  It really feels like you are there experiencing what the Prometheus crew is going through.  Can't wait for the sequel to this prequel!
B007STBUIW|5.0|What a beautiful restoration.  Actually, the blu-ray version looks better than the theater.  Saw it with the grandchildren and they were really transfixed with the movie.  Their mothers in an earlier time registered the same emotions.  And they all agreed, \\"We are going to need a bigger boat\\".
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy this game a couple of times a day as a quick break to clear my mind. I wish the walls would stay up a little longer! Otherwise, cute and fun.
B000TERFGO|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time. Anyone interested in getting to know Jazz from its beginnings should definitely know something about Coltrane.
0439813786|5.0|Saw the movie first, had to watch it twice because the graphics in it are AMAZING!! Movie was very good too! I decided I wanted to get the book and im glad I did! the book has a lot of the drawings in it, which are cool to look at and see how they looked before edited into the movie! Book and movie follow along very well.
B007KOMTUI|3.0|I watched all four seasons on netflix and was hooked.  I am embarrassed I couldn't wait until the fifth season was available on Netflix too.  I searched all over the internet for a free viewing of season five but without success. I did find the cheapest rate on amazon for about $23 but the video quality was so poor I would never do it again.  I could have ordered the disk set for $10 more. But I would never watch them a second time. Oh, well. Next time I will wait. Great season, though!
B000M341RI|4.0|Love this movie. Careful...the default setting includes subtitles. The bonus DVD is okay but nice to get the movie you can't get in a store.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this app is so cool I have been waiting for this app which feels like forever. I think they added a little more to it then its origanal. but it is still a dealt fun app a little bad but it could be better
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I needed a camera bag and didn't really have a lot of money after buying all my camera equipment so I came upon the AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras. THIS BACKPACK IS PERFECT! If you don't really want to spend a crazy amount of money on a high end camera brand slr backpack then this is the way to go. You can pack a lot and it feels great on your back also. Comfortable and adjustable.
1451662432|5.0|I have read \\"life stories\\" of Arnold before but this book by him really is the bomb...I could not put it down from the moment I started it, say what you want about his \\"sexual\\" blunders, and his ego, but the rags to riches story and the incredible drive and determination of the man is a testament to him...The book really \\"speaks\\" to you in Arnold's language and it is funny and charming kinda like Arnold himself.  Would I want to be married to him, HELL no, but do I find him (and this book) amusing and entertaining, you betcha!

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a fun app. I would give it 5 stars but the waiting for only 1 coin at a time is bad. You can buy more but why purchase so few coins for such a high price. You dont get anything for going higher in level. Still a fun little app though.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Yes there were problems, but it was all worth putting up with to see that damn huge gun-looking pilots seat come up out of the floor! That's how it works, and it wasn't an elephant in the seat it was a humanoid! I have waited over 30 years to see that! I remember going to see Alien and Aliens many times. The others were not that great, imo. And I thought my gorgeous wife, Noomi Rapace (she doesn't know we are married) was a great tough-girl Ripley-like character. Nice intensity - and stuff, ahem. I thought the entry and landing on the alien planet was spectacular and I thought David was a very interesting robot with obvious pride and emotions. I'm guessing he was working for the evil corporation just like Ash (bad Bilbo!). So this movie was made for me and I loved it!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I saw this movie recently and felt I should make a review to share with people who has seen the movie or for  people who want to see the movie and want to get a perspective of it at first.<br /><br />First the only snow white in the movie is the 1. Mirror 2. A Dead King 3. The Idea of a Stepmother who wants Snow White dead. That is it, no more, I do not understand why they simply didn't make something else, the fair princess who is in a total mess and everything around her will suffer till she meets 7 gnomes? yes not dwarfs and who apparently is followed by Thor who is lost in it's character and chased by a looney albino ???<br /><br />Seriously WTH is this, not only the main character who was supposed to be Snow White who by definition , was as white as snow, hair as dark as night and have red lips as red as... and whose beauty surpassed everyone else even the \\"queen\\" ok that fails, the girls is not white, the hair is ok black the lips are idk what and she is not breathtaking.<br /><br />The story then falls into LOTR then turns into fairy land and comes back to WTH... I mean really whoever wrote this was on something, then the persons who thought of the main characters and their roles, shared the something the first guys inhaled, and the casting person was clueless.<br /><br />Over all go see Mirror Mirror it's dumb but at least funnier and entertaining.  whoever gave this movie 5 or 4 starts is entertained with plain crap.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is very challenging but that is what I like.Its fun and it makes you think &quot;Where is the 1st dot and where is the 2nd dot? &quot;It also helps if you are mentally challenged then this is the app for you.Also if you have a lttle kid then it can teach colors and connecting the dots.If you are looking for a free challenging game to play while you are bored then this is the app for you.
B00338QENI|5.0|There are many facets to this brilliant and interesting book. A friend recommended this to me and I am very thankful to her. I learnt a lot from this book, on history, science, medicine and journalism.
1609611543|3.0|This book is an ok read.  If you're really interested in celiac or going gluten free, this book is not that great.  It also gives a diet info in there that is definitely not new stuff.
0525953728|5.0|What a great book. I could'nt put it down. A real first hand account of what the 'SEALS' do from training to rescue to assault.I thought it was brialiantly writen.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Crazy as a rabid bat with a toothache but a competently executed B-movie which should be on your short list of favorites.  Fourth Reich warriors in an isolated super-base on the moon execute their plan to invade the Earth.  Special effects are excellent for a $10 million movie, film and sound quality are fine, actors are excellent, the final reel has a Dr. Strangelove feel, and you just can't hate a movie in which Nazis die.  Add it to your list.
0345803493|5.0|The book was like new and I received it ontime. It was packaged well. I will definitely reorder from this sight.:)

B006ZCWU5K|1.0|Like Bob Dylan, Bruce no longer is a relevant singer/songerwriter.<br /><br />I once read an interview with Bob Dylan, when asked why he could no longer write<br />and record songs like he did at the peak of his career (cira 1965). His response, 'it's just not in me anymore'.<br /><br />I can't remember the last time Bruce put out an album/cd that I played more than once. Oh, I got all his stuff ... and like you have seen him perform countless times in concert.<br /><br />Sadly, he is now living off his 'Born to run - River - Darkness & Born in the USA' music. I can't remember the last time I heard any of his new music played on the radio. Luckily I can still hear all the old stuff on Sirius/XM.<br /><br />The new stuff from the previous decade+ ... nothing.<br /><br />This current collection of new music ... Terrible!<br /><br />I will continue to see him perform live when he comes to my town, as I want to remember both his & my 'Glory Days'.<br /><br />What I've written here is truth, I liken it to the 800lb Gorilla in the room, everyone knows it ... but sadly, too afraid to say it anything.<br /><br />Bruce Springsteen - RIP<br /><br />Tim

145162607X|5.0|I do enjoy historical novels, and this is an especially good one. It is a little over 400 pages, but I found it a fast read, because it is so intriguing.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This movie was not what I had expected. It had a great cast of characters and the acting was top-notch. What was interesting to me was how the Director did such a great job at portraying and showing the growth and development of each character. Each character within the movie goes through their own transformation, and it is this transformation that allows you to get engrossed by the movie. Don't get me wrong though, this movie is funny and witty and has a charm that cannot be understated too. All-in-all this was a movie that was a hidden gem as it gave much more than I expected!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Intricate and well developed plot and characters.  Especially love how mr martin keeps true with the characters' personalities as they are changed and develop through the events, people do change in life and he has captured this well. I rarely give full “star“ credit on any review but his work is outstanding beyond any other comparable writer i have read.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was far more capable and interesting than the movie by a mass margin. That may not be surprising but it has a large impact for me in terms of like of this series.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|Twelve tracks...the 10 listed, but adding the new spunky fast-rapping \\"Talkin' That\\" and the great \\"Over The Moon\\", a song that I thought was replaced on the US edition...so the only track missing is \\"Dub On The Track\\" but replaced by 3 tracks...the great new \\"Behind The Music\\", \\"Oath\\" and \\"Talkin' That\\", but not \\"Stay\\" or the Snoop Dogg version of \\"Want U Back\\".<br /><br />Still, Cher has a fun UK-flavoured street pop sound, like Lily Allen meets Jessie J, or in Girls Aloud speak (Cheryl Cole WAS her mentor on the X-Factor, and in my opinion, GA is the greatest girlgroup in modern pop history (1980-now), and their solo careers are stellar)...Cher's solo work combines the pop savviness of Cheryl's solo records with the creative & street sounds of Nicola Roberts' \\"Cinderella's Eyes\\"...compare \\"Want U Back\\" with \\"Beat Of My Drum\\".<br /><br />So Cher's record works in 2 contexts...with the Girls Aloud references and without...overall, it's a fun record and I'm happy it hit here well...still bummed that nothing by GA, group or solo, never had a US release...if they did, I wonder if US pop history would have been the same??  I'm not so sure.<br /><br />Also, I wonder how I can get just the song \\"Dub On The Track\\" without having to buy the UK version of Cher's album as well??

B0071BGOJC|5.0|After a very long time waiting for this book, I bought it the first day possible. Very, very good and (to me) it seems to have been written with more empathy. The carachters were more convincing, I am waiting eagerly for the next book! Definitey worth its price.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|Best photograpy book yet. Will be ordering books number 2,3,4 and four.This book really simplifies photograpy.Scott Kelby is the man!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book! Once I started it, I could not put it down. Read all three in less than 2 weeks.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|I'm glad I didn't pay full price in a theater for this movie! The original story was good, why rewrite it? (and I'm not talking about the Disney version, I mean the ORIGINAL story)<br /><br />Kristen Stewart was the wrong choice for this part. She cannot act very well at all and did not represent \\"the fairest of them all\\" as the mirror tells. In some scenes, her hair looked like a rats nest and she's always pouting.<br /> Some of the situations throughout the movie were unexplained and unrealistic. It seems Hollywood is relying more and more on the stars' names and special effects than a well thought out storyline. I won't give any spoilers but may be some clues to what I'm talking about:<br />Why isn't she dead already? An army comes and they bring a prisoner with them?? Seems everyone lives in a deadly forest? Why is it so deadly? and many more that would give away too much.<br />Charlize does a fine job of being wicked though!<br />Chris Hemsworth is good too but there is no closure in this film for his character.<br /><br />I for one probably won't pay to watch the sequel unless Kristen isn't in it and I can watch it streaming.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was one of the worst books I have ever read. I was very excited for it when it came out and was completely and totally disappointed. I kept hoping that it would get better and that is the reason I kept reading, but when I got to the end, I was literally disgusted. What a horrible end, but I guess it fit with the rest of the book in my opinion.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|The hype of this book has triggered me to download it into my Kindle. The need to finish something that I have already started is the only reason I kept going.<br /><br />The story is implausible, filled with repetitive phrases and at times profanities. It lacks character development and proper writing style.<br /><br />The underlying message is .. frightening to say the least.. that a young woman graduating from University would be willing to sign a contract to become a sex slave, an attempt to find romantic love from a dark and submissive place.<br /><br />He, the self made billionaire at the age of 26 with a flawless anatomy has spotted his 16th sex slave and trying to lure her into signing the contract.<br /><br />The rest is sex, more sex, more and more sex .. BORING!<br /><br />I found myself speed reading half the book as the repetitive use of words (eg. lips, jeez, double crap, crimson, scarlet, & profanities .. ) has enabled me to know the context of the story and jump to the next paragrah.  BORING!<br /><br />Spend your time reading something else !!!

B006L4MX0Y|2.0|My opinion of this movie is based off the movie, not the books. Not \\"historical significance\\". Not \\"my Uncle was in this!\\". Just what I saw on the screen 15 minutes ago.<br /><br />The premise was a bit odd.<br />The \\"world\\" background was totally left out (seems like it was supposed to be a modern day Japan) so it seems odd that the adults decided to toss a bunch of unruly teens -by unruly I don't mean murderers or rapists, just kids who didn't seem to like \\"respecting their elders\\", although in Japan, maybe that's worse than murdering or raping your parent... - onto an island to kill each other off. At least Running Man had a whole world built around it so the suspension of belief was much more attainable.<br /><br />The action wasn't anything special. No cool moves or creative effects (although for the time the addition of the post production blood spray - much like what you see in The Expendables now - might have been ground breaking). All pretty standard to sub standard. The Uzi of unending ammo got real annoying after awhile (he did change clips once but that was for drama - yhea yhea, showing all the clip changing is boring and uninteresting so they just edited those out, right? All, say, 15 of them? how heavy was that backpack in the first place!? btw it was amazing how much his ability with that thing varied).<br /><br />The movie was more about the relationships between the students than anything. That's where most of the screen time went and creative writing. But if that's what you're into, go check out The Breakfast Club before getting this. Personally, I didn't care if any of them lived...or died, really. Of course, I'm not a 16 year old Japanese student, either, so who am I going to relate to? The only two ****incoming spoiler, kinda**** I was glad got it was Ms Psycho chick (with the sickle) and the Uzi guy (just so he'd stop firing that damn Uzi).<br /><br />No idea why this was given 5 stars. I generally don't write reviews even though I have over 1000 movies in my collection, many off Amazon, but the rating for this movie was just so overbalanced I just had to say something.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie is good entertainment.  The movie is full of action and the special effects are great.  My 7th grader loved the movie.  However, she was quick to inform me that the movie DID NOT adhere to the book!
B008PDROCQ|4.0|Granted, HEARTBREAKER has been released before in a remastered format a couple of years ago.  Though that version was much inproved since the CD was first issued, BBR has done a stupendous job to really bring this album full circle for its 30th anniversary.  As with 1979's DIONNE, Ms. Warwick's first Arista outing, HEARTBREAKER was the 4th Arista release and paired Barry Gibb with Dionne after his success with Barbra Streisand's GUILTY.  Though Barry has no official duets with Dionne on this release, he and his brothers are well represented with this stunning album.  The remastering makes this one actually sound \\"live\\".  Stereo separation is improved, and as with DIONNE, there are instruments and backing vocals I am hearing clearly for the first time.  BBR did jump the gun on this issue, as the release was to include bonus tracks of Single versions of a couple of songs.  I don't remember this album having any specific single versions that were differrent from the album versions, or I would've had the 45s back in the day.  BBR did make notation and a reviewer from the UK on Amazon.co.uk noted in his recent review that BBR receiving information from Sony with single versions at lesser time notations, the tracks were discovered to be identical to the album tracks and times.  Arista had mislabeled back in the day, so alas, there are no bonus tracks.  However, you get one punching album of great material.  For Dionne and Bee Gee fans alike.  This is the ultimate version of HEARTBREAKER.<br /><br />Let us hope that BBR will continue with Dionne's Arista catalog of albums and get out recordings that have not been remastered thus far or reissued properly since their original release.  FRIENDS from 1986 most definitely should be the next issue because of \\"That's What Friends Are For\\" and its recent 25th anniversary.  There are some great tunes on this recording, and a definite single version of \\"Whisper In The Dark\\", the second single from the album does exist.  They can continue with FINDERS OF LOST LOVE (Without Your Love overseas) and clean that one up, and possibly extract from somewhere the alternate version of the title track that featured Luther Vandross's vocal, as in the first several episodes of the TV program from 1985-86.  Once the single was issued in January 1985 with Glenn Jones, the track was updated on the TV soundtrack and the other version with Luther disappeared.  At this time also was Dionne's recording of the \\"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\\" theme song CHAMPAGNE WISHES & CAVIAR DREAMS, which has also not seen a single release, and was intended to be one or a B-side.  Just never materialized.  RESERVATIONS FOR TWO would follow & correct something.  As NO ONE IN THE WORLD appeared originally on FINDERS..., Anita Baker released it as a single from her RAPTURE album the following year and had a smash hit with it.  The song was then added again to Dionne's RESERVATIONS album as the tenth track.  Since BBR would remaster both albums, take NO ONE...off of RESERVATIONS and add the alternate version of LOVE POWER with Jeffrey Osborne that was issued in Japan as ENERGY OF LOVE (Love Power).  The lyric in the central chorus changes from \\"you see I haven't gotten over you\\" to \\"we've got to let the Energy of Love shine through\\", which to this day, I do not understand the reason behind it.  Therefore, we have a rarity that should be included.  Other guest appearance tracks could be added to a Dionne album for the first time, including one track recorded for Richard Carpenter's solo release TIME, with Dionne's beautiful lead vocal on \\"In Love Alone\\".  I was expecting this to be the second single after Dusty Springfield's issue with Richard on \\"Something In Your Eyes\\", which was a minor hit before Dusty resurged with the Pet Shop Boys about two years later.  Also at this time, Dionne recorded two tracks for Dave Clark's TIME show concept album released in UK first, then the US.  Both tracks, \\"What On Earth\\" and \\"Within My World\\"included a voiceover at the end of one & beginning of the latter by Sir Laurence Olivier.  Recently, these tracks were made available on US iTunes without Olivier's spoken part.  There are a few odds and ends also to be taken into consideration that wound up as new tracks on US and overseas versions of GREATEST HITS 1979-90 including WALK AWAY, TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU AND ME (with Jeffrey Osborne), I DON'T NEED ANOTHER LOVE (with the Spinners), A TRUE LOVE (with Sacha Diestel), and a track that didn't make these albums, YOU AND I (with Paul Anka).  If you can scrunch all in, extend to 1991 with IT'S ALL OVER (with Dieter Bohlen of Blue System issued on Arista in Europe - single and extended versions), SAIL AWAY from the lullaby album \\"Till Their Eyes Shine\\" and two tracks from Placido Domingo's GOYA concept CD of TILL I LOVED YOU (with Placido, which was a single for Barbra Streisand & Don Johnson prior to this release) and Dionne's gorgeous solo ONCE A TIME (I LOVED YOU).  If there are just too many songs, carry 1991 tracks over to 1993 when you remaster FRIENDS CAN BE LOVERS.  I also left out two Johnny Mathis duets above and beyond the FRIENDS IN LOVE album of TWO STRONG HEARTS from Johnny's Once In A While album (too bad it wasn't a single), and Who's Counting Heartaches from Johnny's Better Together duets album.  These tracks are from 1988 and after.<br /><br />BBR, keep up this great work.  The Dionne Arista catalog never sounded better.  I can get further into FRIENDS IN LOVE, a full concert remaster of HOT! LIVE & OTHERWISE with the studio tracks of the period, HOW MANY TIMES CAN WE SAY GOODBYE (So Amazing overseas) with lots of bonus tracks, and restoring SINGS COLE PORTER with the missing \\"You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To\\", in a later review of any future Dionne BBR releases.

B003ASLJO0|5.0|A wonderful insight into human nature from the worst to the best.  Many surprises throughout, tears will be shed, and no doubt, prejudices will be re-examined from the inside out.  Exquisite film, ignore the physical violence.  It is the violence within the heart that must be dealt with, and it is, quite nicely.  Best Clint Eastwood film I've ever seen.  Rock on, Clint!<br />And I can't get that song out of my head...cruising along the coast highway in 'his' Gran Torino...<br /><br />Perfect condtion from the seller.  Sent in record time.  I gave it as a gift, and it will keep being passed around until there is no more silver left on the dvd...
B000W237RE|5.0|This album reminds me of the loudest concert I have ever attended -- The Allman Bros right after this album was released. That aside, the instrumental/guitar solo in the middle of Blue Sky is my all time favorite guitar -- weaving, soaring, delicate, toe-tapping, wistful, almost visual. Everyone owes it to themself to hear this song a few times!  Close your eyes and let the instruments carry you places. Still \\"Wow\\" after almost 40 years.
B006Z9K97E|4.0|I have read many books on Korean history, famous Korean people biography including NK human rights leaders stories and defectors escaped to freedom stories.  Each story is a painful recollection of what was, what could had been, and at the end of the reading, it would deposit something deep in one's heart, caused us to ask questions if there is justice and righteousness in this world.  Escape from Camp 14 is a very easy to read book, one of those books on NK refugees you must read, it is not just about Mr Shin's painful memory of growing up as a child in an enclosed labor camp that sounded more like those death camps set up by Nazis Germany during WWII. He shared his struggle to forgive himself to have caused his mother and his brother's death in the camp. It was amazing he lived to tell the stories and his stories were confirmed by many who spent time in similar Camps like his, we were brought into the reality as to what really went on inside those labor camps. The author, Blaine Harden, did a very good research on current events to make the book a total completion, with interesting news known or unknown to the public on the high level corruption that went on behind the scene within the Government who used their people to make their life supremely well off while others were dying or suffering from hunger was no pain to these elites. I cried when Mr Shin described the number of people locked up in these labor camps as hostages of the government. The truth is every single ordinary North Korean is a hostage of his own country controlled by a few on top.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing story. I was truly engulfed in each and every page until the very end; each new page providing another surprise. The ending provides an unexpected twist.<br /><br />This story is truly life-changing, and you will consider to yourself how much you really can endure.<br /><br />One of my absolute favorites of all time! I will admit that I loved this story so much, that it made me sad when I had finished the book. I want more stories of Richard Parker and Pi!

0316228532|5.0|They are all there.  Rowling puts together a story that deals with the class differences and idiosyncracies of life in England. Snogging, shagging, and all other kinds of words we usually don't see on my side of the pond. I thought the story was extremely well crafted. It took a couple of chapters for me to adjust to all of the characters thrown into the story, but they were all distinct enough to be be interesting.  Think of a world where Jane Austen re-wrote \\"The Wire\\"... minus the police angle.  Social issues abound and are looked at from all sides.  I honestly thought the book was fascinating!!  I highly recommend!!<br /><br />Regarding the comparison to her previous work... I went to see a famous singer one time who remarked, \\"If you are going to write a famous song, better be sure it has more than three chords and repetitive verse - because that is all some fans will ever want to hear.... for the next thirty years!!\\"  I loved the Harry Potter series, but this book is an apple to those oranges.  Social issue novel vs. Christian Apologist Epic Hero Quest... There is absolutely no way to \\"compare\\".  This is it's own work... and I really liked it!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay
B0026772N8|5.0|While this book is not an \\"easy read\\" by any stretch of the imagination, it is worth taking the time and effort to contemplate. Pirsig's unique approach to telling his story of a cross-country motorcycle ride with his son crosses with his deep and fascinating philosophical internal monologues, while slowly revealing a personal history which involves a descent into mental instability, and the family struggles which go with it. I think the reason why this book is so popular is because it grounds the intense philosophical challenges of \\"quality\\" with a very real personal story and honest, soulful attitude. The reader can feel close to Pirsig's narrator, despite some esoteric and sometimes mysterious images. Highly, highly recommended.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This review was first posted on Kindle Nation Daily.<br /><br />Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan<br />Review by Andrew, 5th grade<br />Teacher:  Julie Treadwell<br /><br />It is very educational and if you like action books, you will think that it is the best book in the world.  The Percy Jackson and the Lightning thief series is a very good and fun way to learn Greek mythology, because he is always fighting and learning about new monsters.<br /><br />The book is about a 13 year old kid who is a demigod a demigod is a person who has a god and a mortal for parents. He trains at a place called camp Half Blood which is where demigods train. He also learns that monsters are real and how to fight with a sword that is made of a special type of bronze. To a mortal it looks like a gun or a dangerous weapon because of the mist, the mist is to make sure that mortals don't learn out about demigods. He makes friends with a girl named Annabeth and a boy named Grover. He is accused of stealing Zeus's lightning bolt. Zeus is the master of the gods and his lightning bolt is the most powerful weapon in the world. Percy is accused of stealing it and even though he pleads innocent he is given ten days to return the bolt or their will be war.

I do not have cancer that I know of. I did become intersted in Kris Carr's books after watching her documentary. I am interested in obtaining a healthier life style and by watching Kriss in her documentary and reading her book I am a huge fan of hers. I have purchased all of her books and read them all except for the cook book which I pre-ordered but will be realease on Oct.30th, 2012.<br />If it were out I am certain that I would have read it or be close to finishing the book. These books are full of personal wit and humor from Kriss. Easy to read and follow. They also contain some healty delicious recipes to try.<br />Kriss Carr is an inspiration to me and I am learning to make lifesyle changes just from reading her books.<br />She is one lady full of wisdom.

B004P8JPS6|4.0|Overall, the storyline was very good. Kept you wondering, how? what next? are they?  With different characters towards the end, it was a bit difficult to keep them all straight. I'd read another story with Jack Reacher.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I don't often write a review of a movie or book unless I really enjoy it or really don't like it, and this book I really enjoyed.  It begins with Charlie, as a 30 year old man, in a time when society is very intolerant of people who are \\"mentally retarded\\" or \\"morons\\" as the book calls them.  Charlie has an IQ of 68 and is in the \\"high functioning\\" area of the mentally retarded spectrum.  The book is written from Charlie's perspective in a series of \\"progris reports\\" as he calls them.  It takes you through months before and after Charlie receives an operation to increase his IQ, at one point taking Charlie up to an IQ of 185.  It is easy for the reader to follow the progress Charlie is making in how he writes, spells, talks, and engages in the world around him.<br /><br />While the book is an incredibly easy read, suitable for young adults, I found it incredibly difficult to read as someone who works with children and adults with disabilities.  This book is very though provoking, making you challenge the way you think and see the world.  While Charlie has an IQ at the genius level he is still lacking in many things, life experience, for example and is expected to \\"grow up\\" very quickly to fit in with main stream society.  The book is heart-wrenching and beautifully heart-warming at the same time, it will send you to bed thinking about it long after you have put it down, and it will challenge how you look at life and society as a whole.  The difficulty I experienced while reading this book made it even better than I think I could have imagined.  It was heart-wrenching to see someone struggle as much as Charlie had as he recalls his earlier memories and struggles to fit in now but, just as I dance in joy of the little successes my clients have, I found myself rejoicing with Charlie as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to read it.  If you are looking for a thought provoking book this book is a winner.  If you are looking to teach children a little bit of tolerance for people who are different, this book is amazing.  If you are just curious what life may be like if we could \\"find a cure\\" for \\"mental retardation\\" this book gives a pretty good example.  Pick it up and enjoy the ride.a little bit of tolerance for people who are different, this book is amazing.

B001EZ2T7W|5.0|I am a big Richard Dean Anderson fan, so I was worried when the line-up changed. No need to worry fans, the energy of Stargate SG-1 is in safe hands. My daughters are new to the series, so the younger, good-looking replacement, made them happy. For me, the action and continued theme thread, made me happy.

B0058YPLA2|5.0|I do love me some Lana Parrilla! She is doing a beautiful job portraying the Evil Queen and is a joy to watch! Finally a legitimate story for the Evil Queen and it has nothing to do with Snow being prettier. I have also really enjoyed the other character's back stories. It makes them so much more fun. Looking forward to season two!!!

B003QP4NPE|5.0|This (and the second half of the story, Freedom) is one of the best books I've ever read. There's lots of action to keep the plot moving and there's plenty of tech thrown in by someone who actually knows tech. There's none of the silly \\"ENHANCE!\\" stuff. The plot is plausible in the very near future and that just makes it all the better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book.  I am ready for number three. The books are better than I thought they would be. very impressed.
B008B0QH5S|4.0|This one's a no brainer: Pet Shop Boys release new album; I buy new album, for every album of theirs has at least a couple of stunners. And the best thing about them? Even if I don't love the melody or music to one of their tracks I enjoy listening anyway for those clever lyrics and sharp observations on human behavior.The one that's jumped out of the pack this time so far is \\"Everything Means Something.\\" Their brilliance is such that each album is layered: I listen once, and a gorgeous chord change catches my ears; listen twice, and it's a great lyrical twist. As for not doing yet another album of dance tracks, perhaps the boys have tired a bit of the clubs? Given the dreadful state of current dance music, which mostly sounds like a bunch of wanna-be-decadent tarts and assorted cheerleaders urging people to \\"party, clap your hands, bla-bla-bla\\" I wouldn't be surprised.However, what I've found is a humor as sharp as cat claws on this album, and at least two of the cuts made me laugh out loud.Do the boys have a sense of humor? Hell yes! They've cut enough rugs in their time; now they're cutting at some of the crap in relationships again, and few do it better. Love \\"Your Early Stuff\\" guys, but I'm a long time fan, and still with you on this one. Whatever else, you are never \\"being boring\\".

We love to listen to music and guess what instruments are being played.  Seeing their faces that afternoon when we watched the video on YouTube was priceless.  They were so surprised to see that it was simply a piano, a cello, and five extremely creative guys.  I'm buying a copy for all of our friends, and for my children's teachers.<br /><br />Thanks guys!  You've got three new fans, and more in the wings.
B001BJNIIK|5.0|love this they should have did a follow up movie
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan you went to the next level. Until last week the series was characterized by heroism and friendship, maybe a crush here and then, but nothing serious. \\"The Mark of Athena\\" is not a romantic book, but it certainly introduces its characters to the epic love that goes beyond death, without being tooooo much (A.K.A twilight) at the same time that keeping the heroism that we all love.<br /><br />Althouhg there is some rivalry between Jason and Percy, both show their fears and learn to lean on each other. I love that the characters are older, and more mature.<br /><br />BTW... Leo is the best!!! Team LEO!!!!  I hope he has better luck in the next book.<br /><br />It will be a very long wait until the next book.  Thanks Mr. Riordan!!!
B0014YPEI4|5.0|ok,before i get started i'd like to get this detail down:it looks just like big al from [[ASIN:B000B7HZQY Allosaurus - A Walking with Dinosaurs Special]]!<br />it's rather ironic,wouldn't you say? onto the toy itself,it's a nice color on the belly,but it's paler than i expected. at first i expected something closer to the<br />style of the [[ASIN:B004JQN4WM Papo Ankylosaurus]],but it's not bad at all,and arguably looks even better on the allosaurus than the papo ankylo's colors would. the back has details to show thickness,like armor. it looks even more armored than the ankylo! again,i like this in the toy. there's red in the crest around the eyes,which is realistic. the eyes are just like on the papo ankylo,orange with black pupils. the pose is rather dynamic,with him circling around,looking at whatever's beside him. but with his jaw open,it changes like magic to him aggressively roaring at a foe. the arms are touching (one almost touching) the legs,meaning a kid wouldn't really get a kick out of this if they like arm combat. as for the jaw,that's why i was wanting a papo carnivore forever after i saw the papo ankylo's detail,dosen't open that wide,but to be fair,the teeth,tounge and insides of the mouth are all easily visible and detailed.  he's got spikes on his neck,back,and tail. however,they are not as big as the picture makes them look. my thoughts when i opened this were \\"this is huge!\\" but yet,this is said to be the smallest of papo carnivores. (the velociraptor being an exception). if a 9 and a half (9 1/2) inch long toy is one of the smallest,i can only speculate what the t rex,or even spino may be like! overall,if i can find the dinosaur i need in papo's line,which there is an extremely good chance of,then i would always consider that one first. papo has the best detail i've seen in pretty much all my life.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|A great way to keep track of the stock market and your investments. I watch Bloomberg TV and this makes me feel connected to the Stock market when I am on my Kindle Fire. This is a must........ you will love it...
0345803485|4.0|I was told book two of the trilogy wasn't worth reading and I was told also that it was a must read. I have found that it is a must read, because they are falling in love. I can't wait until I get to book three.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|I first saw Mayer Hawthorne on Live From Daryl's House and loved his music immediately. It reminds me of the old soul music I loved as a kid, but it has modern touches.  This second album is at least as good as his first, if not better. Beautiful music that is sexy and romantic.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am addicted!  .  . . . . . :).....:)<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />. .<br />.. . . . .
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I was unaware of Mayer Hawthorne until I saw him as a guest on Live From Daryl's House.  His music is wonderful and reminds me of the soul music I loved as a kid, but with modern touches.  Very sexy and romantic and I loved it immediately.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|TWD is one of my favorite TV shows.  I had, of course, already seen season 2 but it was as good the second time.  I also have season 1 and am planning on buying all seasons of TWD.  If you like this type of genre and have not seen TWD, you should buy the DVD sets, you will not be disappointed.
B005FWO3QK|5.0|I have been watching several of the segments from Wagner's Ring series  from the Bayreuth DVD and have been immensely impressed by the quality of the performances. The music is specially moving in such memorable pieces such as the \\"Flight of the Valkyries \\", the Rheingold maidens opening piece, and the pieces by the giants. I highly recommend it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This was one of the funnest games I have ever played! I played all of the levels, found all of the files and I-nators, and guided Balloony! It was hard enough that it was a challenge, but not enough to discourage. There are levels that make you think and levels that make you say &quot;Duh&quot;.<br />Throughout the game, I found myself humming &quot;Doobie, Doobie , Doobie, Doobie, Doobie, Doobie Perry! Can't wait for more levels!!<br />I have it on my Fire and my Galaxy S II and it played extremely well on both.
B005HJU7HA|2.0|I love Conan Doyle's stories and his Sherlock Holmes tales are legendary. But this \\"complete\\" edition is a mess. It's not just that the breaks between stories are sloppy and that there are typos and font errors.<br /><br />THE STORIES ARE OUT OF ORDER.<br /><br />This is very important after you read \\"The Final Problem.\\" I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't read \\"The Final Problem,\\" but trust me: you CAN'T go on and read \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" much less even start \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\" as the edition lays things out without being hopelessly confused. The next story in order is \\"The Adventure of the Empty House.\\" And I don't have time to type out the rest of the order. You can look that up for yourself.<br /><br />This Kindle edition is cheap, but not worth the mess and confusion -- especially if you're giving this to a young person. Spend a couple extra dollars and get an edition that's professionally produced.
B008J34466|5.0|PINK's latest album takes you on a journey of emotion that is real and relatable. Just Give Me a Reason is a stand out track that will speak to everyone. Beam Me Up and How Come You're Not Here are heartfelt in the special way only PINK can pull off. I never buy music but I purchased this album and would do it again.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|When you start watching \\"War Horse\\" movie, make sure you carve out 2.5 hours out of your time to watch this wonderful movie.  The story is set in early 1900s in England just before an onset of the Great War.  A young man from rural England finds himself training a horse to plow fields in the area that is clearly hostile to any agricultural endeavor.  The horse itself is a magnificent animal.  He is not a work horse; he is smaller and more fit to be a race horse than anything else.  His personality is amazing and before long, young man Albert and this new horse he names Joey create unbreakable bond.<br /><br />As Wold War I breaks out and Germany declares war on England, Joey is sold to the British army to help out during the war.  His young caretaker is heartbroken from being separated from the animal that is clearly his great companion.  Joey first becomes officer's horse, but as war goes on his destiny leads him from British to German and then French population.  Joey makes friendhip with another horse as equally beautiful and honorable as himself.  As story evolves, we see how at times of war people of all backgrounds and all generations are able to connect with this amazing animal that allows them to connect with their own humanity.  Joey is able to give them back their dignity, love and understanding that even humans lose touch with after seeing all the horrors of the war.<br /><br />I will not retell the movie, because it will spoil the viewing of another Steven Speilberg's hearwarming story.  This film is meant for all generations.  It has moments that are touching and deeply emotional.  I enjoyed this film from start to finish.
B008XG1X18|4.0|it works just like using it on the computer although it sometimes gets stuck and I have to close out of it and restart but this doesn't happen too often. fun on the go!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|you know you lost lots of money as a kid playing this game! now you can play and not lose REAL money!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I like the book overall but was dissapointed with the ending. The book kept me intrigued & I wanted to read more each day.
B000ID37RM|1.0|Took forever to download then it would not play on my ipad.  :(  Threw away $3.00. Too bad...it's a good movie.
B00003CXB4|4.0|good way to reduce cost on getting kid movies for my daughters.<br />I highly recommend it for all parents.<br />the movie was great
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy to use. I like the backspace button. data from previous input is also handy. I can reccomend this ap as A+
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Very good, can't wait for book 6. As with the previous 4 books, I couldn't set it down, I wanted to keep reading to the end.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|fun game I like how there are many different types of puzzels but some did not work correctly and that was frustrating.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is so convient for me.  I keep my Kindle Fire beside my bed and when I wake up and want to review the weather, I do it on Klndle Fire.  I don't have to wait through commercials to see the weather on television.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|One of the best Reacher books I've read.  Once I got it open I couldn't put it down.<br />I'm still waiting for a Reacher romance in at least one of his adventures but will continue to read them if it's not to be.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The graphics were better than average and the storyline was interesting. I especially liked that the Hint button can be used without penalty if you get stuck.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game.  Wish it was easier to buy land. Every thing else is great though. Can't wait to expand my city.
1476712042|5.0|I love books but it takes me a while to read them between working full time and being a nanny, I finished this book in two days it was AMAZING I completely fell for Travis and cant wait to read the second book next year when it comes out! I would highly recommend this book to read :)
B0084AZXKK|3.0|I thought this book was good, usually classics are, but I didn't find enough action or twists and personally my favorite character was either Ben Gunn or Long John Silver. Overall I give this book 3 stars for reasons I've already stated.
0525953728|5.0|I have not finished reading this book, but so far it is without a doubt one of the most compelling accounts of a great day in American History. It only makes me appreciate all my service personnel more. Everyone should read this account.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was amazing! I went through so many emotions while reading this. One minute I was giddy and the next minute I was crying! Sometimes I find that second books in a series are just fillers but that definitely was not the case with this one! I highly recommend it! One of my favorite books I have ever read. Cannot wait for the next one!
B00000G42T|5.0|Used to have similar copy and lost it. So glad I can find another one, with good quality and price.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a great saga. Great story, well written.  Can't wait to read the rest of the series.  Good introduction to the evolution of both WWII and WWII.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|What a sweet and inspirational family movie! We all laughed and cried. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to prove that people don't need a lot of sex and violence to be entertained!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game longer in a day's time than I really like to admit. I play it every day. I guarantee you will love it!
1423140605|5.0|I love this book! Riordan just gets better and better with each book. I was suprised at how much happened in this book in such little time but it didn't feel jumpy or chaotic.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|i have only begun to read this novel but already recognize superior writing and a good storyteller.  i have only read up to chapter three but already the charactors have come alive and make me want to know thewm better.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Reading these interviews makes me realise that Top can now never make an album that satisfies even the bulk of listeners. To do that it would need to sound like the First Album, Tres Hombres, and Eliminator all at the same time.<br /><br />For me though, well I'm largely out there on my own.  Twist my arm and I'd rate my favourite Top albums as Tres Hombres, El Loco, and Mescalero.<br /><br />The sound of La Futura kinda started with XXX, and progressed through Mescalero.  Whatever you think of these three albums, they all start with a blistering, dirty, dirty guitar sound, which then resurfaces intermittently across the albums.<br /><br />Song choice is typically varied.  I'd thank Rick Rubin for that, but really, that's what ZZ Top do anyway.  Though Flyin' High does sound an awful lot like an AC/DC number....<br /><br />I don't think La Futura, good though it is, tops Mescalero though.  My reasons are:<br /><br />- Patchy songs.  While songs like Gotsta Get Paid and Heartache in Blue are fantastic, gritty numbers, \\"soft\\" tracks like Over You really are over me, and some seem comparatively ordinary, like It's Too Easy Mañana.<br />- This is a short album in the post CD era.  Just under 40 min for the 10 track around 46 min with bonus tracks.  In other words the pool of tracks is smaller to start with.<br /><br />Now my techy assessment.<br /><br />The album sounds to be well recorded and mixed, but unfortunately is mastered by Vlado \\"Destroyer of Music\\" Meller.  Rick Rubin likes the Destroyer, which surprises me.  I'd have thought Rick would know compressing the *%!& out of music just for first hearing impact is pretty lame.  And the Destroyer went to town on this album.<br /><br />So compressed is it the levels are right up there with that much criticised Metallica \\"Death Magnetic\\" CD.  The only good news is unlike that Metallica train wreck, somehow La Futura only sounds badly hurt, not fatally wounded.<br /><br />Oh well, maybe the vinyl will, as the vinyl sometimes does, get mastered by someone who actually likes music.  (update - the vinyl is two 45rpm discs of the 10 track album.  Mastered by The Destroyer, it is heavily compressed, but no where near as bad as the CD, which is probably why it DOES sound better.  PLEEEEAAASSSEEEE dump Rubin, dump Vlado, get someone who cares what the music sounds like!)<br /><br />A final grumble - what sort of rip-off is allowing one retail chain to have extra tracks?  That's money first, screw the fans marketing.
0439023521|5.0|From start to finish I was completely engaged in the stories, characters and I just would love to have more and more.  I really look forward to reading what is in store for these characters and this world that was so easy to delve into.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|Since the update this app is horrible.  It wont open documents. It also keeps asking me to download a font package.
B0039HR5QS|3.0|I have seen this movie several times and recently watched it for free on Amazon Prime on the Kindle Fire. It has probably been over 10 years since I last watched this movie. It is amazing how poignant this movie is to today's current events. It was beyond it's time. The only thing I felt contrived was the relationship between Dunaway and Redford. When this movie was first screened, the Middle Eastern espionage must have appeared outlandish but for today's audience, it is very real. I am not going to go over the plot of the movie since other reviewers have done so. It it is worth viewing. If you like Robert Redford, you will like this movie. He's very sexy in the Navy Peacoat. Cliff Robertson is also very good in this movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just like books 1 and 2, this book is written so vividly that you have a real sense of Christian and Ana's life together...their love story.  Best series of books I have ever read
B0036T31YY|1.0|The plot and acting for this movie are terrible. The conclusion doesn't make any sense. I watched this movie because of the positive reviews. After watching the movie, I wonder if the positive reviewers were paid to review this movie. It is very frusterating to watch because the main character continues to make the same mistakes over and over again. The ending brings no closure. Spoiler: The beginning is the ending and the ending is the beginning. I suppose the writer thought it would be witty but it is just a ridiculous plot.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was funny, mysterious, and gripping to read. I wonder if this kind of thing is happening now. Some young couples that are married for 5 or 10 years, getting bored with each other, and wanting a way out of it?
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The continuing drama of the struggling relationship of Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell.  They're the best and worst things that have ever happened to each other.<br /><br />Eva is still having trust issues... trying to learn to trust and believe in Gideons' faithfulness (much like in book #1 [[ASIN:0425263908 Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel]]...and she's tortured with such a jealousy that it constantly casts suspicion upon every beautiful brunette female that Gideon talks to.  She and Gideon are physically close (that's putting it  mildly)...but always emotionally distant.<br /><br />I LOVE Gideons' damaged soul.  He's strong yet he's weak in no many instances.  He has to have complete honesty, truth and trust from Eva.  I LOVE his possessiveness of Eva.  He has to be in total control.  He's THE ultimate \\"control freak\\" - - he seldom bends.  LOVE IT!!!...(but that's just me)<br /><br />Gideon and Eva's lives are fraught with drama...DAILY drama  - - and it can get exhausting at times just reading about it - - seldom is there a peaceful moment between them.  They both can read suspicion into the tiniest, most innocent issue/action.  It's exhausting, true....but fascinating and exciting to watch these two tortured souls work through their issues and both grow towards each other.  It's exhausting.  It's crazy.  It's great!!  Compromising is sometimes hard for both of them to relent and give.  Eva is so incredibly insecure and wants Gideon ALL THE TIME...except when she wants \\"space\\".  lol...doesn't make sense, but that's the way she is.<br /><br />Once again Cary's character steals a few scenes with his witty dialogue and comic-relief.  He's such a messed up Sweetheart..ya gotta love him.<br /><br />I loved this second installment of the Crossfire Trilogy.  Ms. Day does a phenomenal job bringing sharp attention to detail.  The characters and plot are strong and well developed with special attention paid to the issues and trauma of child abuse.  Brava Ms. Day!  Brava and Encore..ncore..
B0087HT36U|4.0|I liked that it made me think. A good game for passing time. There are still a few levels I didn't make gold on, will be replaying them.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|We watched this when nothing else was going on. It had some great action scenes and an interesting plot. I didn't even mind Tom Cruise although it was the rest of the cast that made this movie great.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin Dozed is a very addictive game but very fun trying to get the prides is kool to,  would recommend for anyone
B001H1SVO8|5.0|David Fincher is one of the masters of modern cinema, this is by far, one of his best works.<br /><br />Norton and Pitt perform flawlessly.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|The overall movie was alright.  There were definite portions that seemed to drag, most due to Kristen Stewart's acting skills but some scenes just lacked focus.  If you want a great movie this is not the one, but if you want to be mildly entertained then by all means, enjoy.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Another hit from Ryan Murphy and company! This show is sexy, suspenseful, and totally creeptastic and addicting. All of the actors do an incredible job but Jessica Lange is the true standout. I plan on watching a marathon to get hyped up for season 2. CANNOT WAIT!!!!! :)
0792839749|3.0|The quality of this movie left a lot to be desired. I loved the movie as a child and wanted to share it with my Grandchildren. I was sorely disappointed with the quality, and there were several glitches throughout the movie. An old movie does not mean the quality should be so bad from Amazon; it almost looked pirated.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Absolutely love this game! I downloaded 2 and 3 and both are very fun if you like the match 3 kind of games. Even my 8 yr old daughter enjoys these!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it! Can't wait for the next book!  Great read after 50 Shades! Do wish we could just buy one book instead of three, but totally worth it!  BSDM for moms.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I lost 20 diamonds and lost the whole world but my buildings. Can you help please try and fix this game I have been playing nonstop for the last 3 days after school and I have been playing it with my baby brother I also have it on the xbox computer and a ipad
0525953728|4.0|I received the book just as promise and it was in excellent condition. Really haven't had a chance to read so I have no feedback on that part of the book. I would buy from this seller again. Very satisfied.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great way to build self-esteem. Being rewarded for doing almost nothing is great for slow children and Alzheimer's patients. Amazing.
B002WJI66C|5.0|This toy is really fun. I love its design, and its very cool. Kids and Super Mario plush collectors will love it! Highly reccommended and get this item at a good price, preferably the lowest one. Great Toy!
B002KKBVTC|5.0|It has a great on board blade storage compartment. The main tool tip retracts in and out and fastens with a nice little screw. Feels solid even though it's metal mixed with plastic.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|So glad to find that so many people have rallied behind this film.  This movie had just about everything that you could want from a fantasy / sci fi movie.  Just watch it and find out for yourself.<br /><br />I would definitely go see a sequel, and I hope that this following ensures that one will be made.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not a good read. Same thing over and over, and nothing in it but continuous sex, and just doesn't go anywhere with the ending. Will not purchase the next two, that's for sure.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its an awesome game. I play it everyday. my sister even plays it.fun fun fun fun fun fun fun .
B000002J2F|5.0|Sadly though,  It will be the last time they have one.  Not to say they didn't deliver strong albums after,  They would just never be of this caliber again.  1980 found genesis merging from progressive rock into pop rock.  Duke became the bands transitional album.  This is a definitive symphonic progressive rock album.  The band is incredibly tight for this album and give the listener a variety of tones and styles that never gets dull.  One will notice a strong Phil Collins vibe during a few of the songs that would have probably sounded more at place on one of his solo albums.  His couple of songs are my least favorite but do not distract to much from the overall classic Genesis effect.  There is still a heavy dose of classic genesis to be found on Duke.  This CD seems to get better each time you listen to it.  It is so intricate and an example of how effortlessly Genesis were able to grow and change with the direction of popular music.  This would probably be considered \\"selling out\\" to some however,  given the fact that they were able to maintain most of their original sound while still doing music that would actually chart said a lot about their creativity.  Take David Bowie for example,  Does the Ziggy Stardust album sound anything like Lets Dance.  Genesis would become an even more \\"commercial\\" band after duke but at this point they were still the Genesis most new and loved.  I would put this in my top 5 Genesis albums including the Gabriel era, and that's saying a lot.
B00243FQFA|5.0|While the finale of the series could be call ambiguous it also left a decent ending that will still leave many fans of the series happy enough so there should be little disgruntlement felt by them.  This season saw the removal of Sam Carter as leader of Atlantis and the Representative of the IOA placed in charge though he isn't the puppet many expect him to be. Also we see a much stronger showing of some of the background characters which is appreciated especially since this is the final season I guess the writers and producers felt that those characters deserved that.  While we say goodbye to this sci-fi series which started weak but ended strong a sad farewell you can add this series to your other t.v. show dvd collection to watch again at your leisure and for the price very much worth it....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I said it before and I will say it again.....I LOVE SYLVIA DAY!!! I am her newest, biggest fan! I have been impatiently waiting for Reflected in You forever it seems and NOW I have to wait again for the next book!<br />Reflected in You in my opinion was a touch bit better than Bared to You. It has just enough of everything you need in a hot steamy book!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|When you thought the Winchester brothers faced their harshest troubles yet when dealing with out of control angels now they have to deal with another of Gods creations the Leviathans.  The series has had its ups and downs in entertainment but overall the series still is entertaining and hopefully last a few more years,at least ten even like Smallville which would be fair I think. Anyways it's nice to have a show which doesn't follow the clone shows of forensics(CSI/CSI:Miami/CSI:New York) or the typical cop shows(Law&Order/Law&Order:SVU/Law&Order:Criminal Intent/NCIS/Criminal Minds). The series gives us the spooks and scares we enjoy greatly from ghosts to rabid humans, the chemistry the two actors have between them is also what makes the show so entertaining as you can almost believe that their actual brothers on how they act and while you expect that kind of talent from good actors you still need the camaraderie and chemistry to make that work.  If you like shows that deal with the supernatural or just plain action shows with a talented cast here's a good series to check out, after you watch it I'm sure you'll be clamoring to collect the entire season sets to add to your t.v. show library collection...
B00881VLCE|5.0|good game enjoying everyday. very pretty pictures to choose from.lots of free ones. has a large variety to pick from
B005K17RU0|5.0|great!!!!!! like it a lot.  quick. easy. it gives me what I need when looking for my weather report. thanks.
B00000425R|5.0|This is a splendid recording of the complete set of the Op.6 Concerti Grossi by Arcangelo Corelli, performed by the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields conducted by Neville Marriner. Corelli lived a generation before the better-known Antonio Vivaldi but he wrote concertos in a similar style. String instruments much as we know them today were developed in Cremona in the 17th and 18th centuries by three families in particular - Amati, Guarneri and Stradivari - to replace the viols that had been used in the previous centuries. As a result, there were several composers, in Italy especially but also elsewhere in Europe, who composed works for these exciting new-sounding instruments. The Concerto Grosso was effectively a musical structure that subsequently, in the hands of Albinoni and Vivaldi, became known simply as concertos, often with one, two or four solo violinists. Here there are three string players - two violins and one cello - playing as a group (the `concertino') in contrast to the whole body of strings (the `concerto grosso'). In addition we have a bass line or continuo made up of Christopher Hogwood, Trevor Pinnock and Colin Tilney on harpsichord or organ and Robert Spencer and James Tyler on theorbos. These concerti are quite short pieces - the longest is the `Christmas Concerto, No. 8 in the set at 13 minutes - but are they all quite delightfully warm sounding in this recording.
0345803507|5.0|i loved the other two book and this one keep up with the other two. i also like how they ended the book and i cant wait for the books in his point of view so good!!! the shipping was fast and the book was in great condition
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|This 1993 movie is based on an Ira Levin novel of the same name. It tells the story of a New York publishing editor, Carly Norris (Sharon Stone), who moves into a New York high-rise apartment building. The apartment she moves into has become available as a result of the death of the previous tenant, Naomi Singer. As soon as she moves in she attracts the attention of the building manager, Zeke Hawkins (William Baldwin), who promptly seducer Carly. Another tenant in the apartment building is dried-up author Jack Landsford (Tom Beringer). Hawkins holds Landsford responsible for Singer's death, while Landsford blames Hawkins. It emerges that Hawkins owns the building and that he has had video equipment installed in every apartment to spy on his tenants. There are some tense moments as the possible guilt of one of the two suspects swings back and forth between them. There is a cameo part for Martin Landau as Carly's Editor-in-chief, Alex Parsons. This is an entertaining thriller, quite erotic in parts as Sharon Stone's movies often are.
B007H1HQW0|3.0|the cutter was fairly easy to assemble the cutter and actually pretty easy to use.  However after following instuctions to the letter I still managed to break 2 out of every three bottles.  After getting a case of wine bottles from a restaurant and practicing with different pressure of scores, different amounts of time in hot and cold baths, etc., I finally landed on a nuance that worked, but suffice it to say, there is a learning curve and skill set inolved with this.  As long as you go into it with eyes open and don't expect perfection, you will be OK.
B001DHXT2A|5.0|This is a vast improvement over the Ang Lee Hulk movie. The CGI looked very good and the Abomination was a great choice as the villain. I just wish the would of cast Mark Ruffalo as the hulk in this movie it would of made it a little better, he does a great job as the Hulk in the Avengers. I am not saying Edward Norton did a bad job as the Hulk but it seemed to me after watching The Avengers, that Mark really played the part better, especially when he is Bruce, and everyone knows the Hulk is nothing if you don't have the right Bruce. Don't let that stop you from seeing this movie though. It is filled with alot of.action, and well worth a viewing. I have the DVD version, but want to badly upgrade to the blu ray version, because I have heard this is one of the best looking blu ray films from Phase one. So if you are looking to upgrade, based on what I have been told you should definitely do that.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is fun, i like it because it makes you keep going until you connect them all. it is also good for your mind.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I really enjoyed Thor. The blu ray version is beautiful. The 3D is pretty good, not alot of out-of-screen effects, but it does add depth to the movie. Chris and Tom did a incredible job playing Thor and Loki. Tom was just so sneaky, he was like a snake slithering around, he was so deceitful, what more could you ask for from a villain. I think he has become one of the most liked villains, that just goes to show you what a wonderful job he did with his character. Chris is Thor! He reminds me of Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, once you see him you just can't imagine anyone else playing that part. The only gripe I have about this movie is that I wish they would have spent more time in Asgard or another realm besides earth. I wanted more of the fantasy world, but hopefully we will get that with Thor 2! I liked the introduction of Hawkeye in this movie, it was like a little bonus. Marvel and Disney are doing a great job with these movies, let's just hope they keep up the good work with the sequels.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I read some of the reviews with complaints about it being slow. ive had no problems with this app. I love it.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|This is the movie that kick started the Marvel Universe Phase One. This is a awesome movie and Robert Downey Jr is the one and only Iron Man. This will be the role he is remembered for. He does a excellent job playing Tony Stark. I had this movie on DVD, but it was on sell at Walmart for 10 dollars on blu ray, so I picked out up along with The Avengers 3D blu ray, and if you haven't seen The Avengers yet be sure to do that, it is a can't miss movie. Back to Iron Man, the blu ray version looks very nice and was well worth the upgrade. I enjoy the story line of IM1 a little more than IM2. I am not saying IM2 is a bad movie, cause it is not, I just enjoyed seeing how Tony Stark progressed into Iron Man. The action in this movie is fantastic and the CGI is incredible! I think the CGI along with Downey's performance is what really makes this movie believable. If you haven't seen this yet, make sure you do, you don't want to miss out on this blockbuster, and if you are wondering if you should upgrade, if you can find it for a reasonable price go ahead, you won't be disappointed!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|really great game!!! so glad I bought it!! cant wait for the next one!! and it works great on my kindle fire!
034580404X|4.0|I would give it 5 stars if it had been 1 book ,not a triology ...since it is what it is,the story is unusual and worth reading
B0053O89JM|5.0|This is exactly the product we wanted.  In fact, it came so fast we were surprised.  We pre-ordered House, Season 8 and it got here the day before its release date.  We'd just got done watching the 1st 7 seasons in a 2 week House marathon, so the timing was perfect!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really liked this book. It was well written and gave a good idea of these anonymous heroes that do things that no one else can do in places no one can find under conditions that would deter anyone. AND they don't crow about it.<br />  These guys are the REAL Men In Black. The best of the best of the best.....Sir!<br />The training, the deployments, the mind set, the operations, the BS. It's here in words and details that make you want to keep reading even though you know that UBL gets it in the end.<br />Recommend it for any one!
0743496736|5.0|This book is probably one of my favorite books by Jodi Picoult. If you like a mystery type book, that unravels as it goes on then this is your type of book. She does very well writing this book. It has many twist and turns making the unexpected happen. She was able to make the characters so that you could place them in a school setting and just visualize exactly what was happening. She kept it interesting the whole time, because in different parts of the chapters different people would narrate what was going on from there perspective. She would give you flashbacks so as to give you clues to the future. All of this just making the story more complex and better. I would definetly recommend this to someone who is a fan of this author or a fan of these kind of books.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|boring movie and snow white was not the fairest in the land. need to stick to the true story more just didnt care for it.i should have just rented it
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just like book one I started it and couldn't put it down. I prepurchased it on my kindle so kept checking to see if it had downloaded yet. Loved it so much can't wait for book 3 to see what happens to them. I would so recommend this book but be sure to read book one first<br />Not going to go into the story line as I don't wait to mess it up for those who haven't read it but you will love it if you love Sylvia Day
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|The acting is incredibly scripted. The main actor is no Arnie, thats for sure. He grumbles along through his obviously scripted dialog worse than the new Batman.<br />The special effects and costumes are pretty awesome. There is a good bit of gore, which pleases me.<br />It seems like hollywood is always trying to redo classics and it never quite works out. A good example is the new karate kid.<br />Its worth watching if you get it for free with prime. I definitely wouldnt pay for it, though.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I was a little bored with the beginning of the movie.  It is necessary to establish relationships between the characters for later in the movie.  Hopper shows he is able to foul things up without trying and is lacking in leadership abilities, that is until he meets the aliens.  From then to the end of the movie is non-stop action.  I especially enjoyed the last battle scene when the USS Missouri is allowed to show her stuff after being a museum for so long.  Providing awesome naval gunfire that tore the alien vessel to pieces.  Another thought provoking event in the movie is a Japanese naval captain serving aboard the USS Missouri helping to defeat the alien invaders. Wonder of wonders.  Providing a skeleton crew of her original sailors, now aged, was also a nice touch since the current sailors had not a clue of how to fire the boilers much less load the 16 inch guns.  Anyone who likes war movies will enjoy this production.  The special effects and computer graphics are very realistic and beleivable.  A good way to take your mind off your worries for a period of time.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Don't get me wrong, Reflected in You was still a great book, it was more or less the same thing from the 1st book, but G was much more sinister but we found out a little more about him. Sylvia brought a lot of things together that I wanted or was looking for.. well more like a \\"teaser\\" of information.. and Eva and her never ending jealousy. I was yelling at my Kindle.. I couldn't help it..<br />I'm looking forward to reading the last book, I'm sure Syliva has bunch of surprises for us!!  =)  And I can't wait!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|True to Lee Child's form of writing.  Jack is at his best in this book broken nose and all.  A  MUST read book for Jack Reacher's fans.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Hilarious from beginning to end and sure to offend anybody who considers themselves Politically Correct! As funny as Borat and totally without shame, Baron Sasha Cohen has done it again!
B008XG1X18|4.0|love this --so many great ideas ----app has issues connecting sometime but it is worth the hassle --I recommend it ---works well on my kindle fire
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the new angry birds.Simple but fun. The objective is to run as far as you can.<br />Also watch out for the trees stumps by sliding your finger up , and the sharp turns by sliding your<br />finger to the leftnor right. If you don't do it fast enough you'll get eaten.  If you make it far enough<br />just keep going. A few pointers this game you can colllect coins and it does not have life's if you lose do it over and over . You can see how many miles you ran.<br />  You will enjoy this game.
B009KUANWG|5.0|It won't move you like \\" Set fire to the rain\\" but it certainly is a beautiful song, that I will love to listen to when I am shuffling my songs! Nice, slow with a bit of a dark feeling all over..you won't regret buying this if you like Adele..
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is an enjoyable way to play solitaire.  no hassles or<br />outrageous moves. just have fun and dont worry about anything
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Not what I have enjoyed in the past with Jack Reacher:<br />Ending was weak and some of the developing plots were not up to the standard of Mr Childs:
B003WH765U|5.0|One of Brando's better non-tough guy roles. The story of an Air Force Officer's accidental love affair with a beautiful Geisha singer/dancer, and the Military's officials ban on such relationships, is central to the story. The orientals also ban such alliances. The secondary same affair/story features Red Button's great performance. The ending inspires both tears and inspiration. Very beautifully told classic love stories.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It say it was available for my cellphone but it doesnt work!!!! I want my money back!!!!!! I would never buy another app from here!!! they should have apps that usually work for specific phones not just sell it without working!!!<br />I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust is an excellent movie for all ages.  Very entertaining and I recieved the movie earlier than expected.  I will definitely order more movies in the future.  AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I LOVED Bared To You and was so looking forward to the sequel. Although Eva and Gudeon's relationship was still totally hot and magnetic, there was so much fighting and secrets that left me feeling like I was in a really bad relationship.  I felt like I was trying to stay connected and invested throughout the whole book.  In the end, I was happy with the answers revealed, but I'm really hoping for a solid conclusion in book 3!
0316228532|5.0|I can't say how happy I was to see this side of Rowling. She has definitely matured as a writer since her first book, and it was great to see her writing at her full potential, in a way she could not while writing Harry Potter. This is an honest account of life, and a great example of how the life of one person can be so deeply entwined with that of others.<br />The one thing to keep in mind is this is not a children's book. It's not intended to be. The writing style can be compared to that of John Irving -- extremely truthful and close to reality. Overall it's a great read. Although it's extremely different than the Harry Potter series, it is in no way inferior.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Loreena's crystal-clear singing is always a delight, and her meticulous production matches her performance.  That magical combination is present here in The Wind That Shakes The Barley.  It is a pleasure to admire her work.
030788743X|3.0|Ready Player One is an imperfect novel that does little more than use its plot as a means of making '80s pop culture and broader geek culture references. The protagonist is a socially awkward high school senior that acts as a geek empowerment fantasy. The antagonist, a representative of a soulless profit-driven corporation, is evil yet cartoonishly inept at everything he does throughout the book and is little more than a strawman for corporate greed. The world is your typical cyberpunk dystopian future but nothing is done to flesh it out, but that's not surprising considering the book mostly takes place in a virtual reality called OASIS. This novel is meant solely for geeks, there's not alot there for those outside of the target demographic to latch onto in the story.<br /><br />All that said, I still found myself enjoying the novel. That's probably just because I was in the target demographic and I am willing to bath in geek pandering. Objectively this book is a 2.5/5, but my geek bias adds the other 0.5 star.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|The first hint of Autumn is on us when we fire up this CD from the ever-impressive Loreena McKennitt. Midwinter Night's Dream is interesting, thoughtful, and certainly musical.  You will enjoy it!

B005IQZB14|5.0|A fun read for hikers and non-hikers a like.  It is in part a young adult coming of age story and in part the human journey of the learning to be alone and learning to face challenges. I found it hard to put down and enjoy it very much.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Augmented human memory in a portable - nearly omnipresent - way. Where were you whilst I was in school? Fantastically easy to use and maintain. Thank you.

B0058YPLA2|5.0|Once Upon A Time on ABC in my opinion is the best show of the year! I was looking forward to get this Blu-ray and the three to four month wait after pre-ordering it was worth every minute. First off, I think this is a great show, because it just isn't mainly a kid show, but a show for the whole family to enjoy. Every actor/actress in the show I feel do their roles superbly from the lead actor and lead actress to best supporting actor and actress to everyone else. I have not been disappointed at with the performance of each person. Also this blu-ray has great audio commentary to certain episodes on each disc by the directors, and actors/actresses. The special features on this blu-ray is awesome and really delves into the fairy tales that we have grown to know and bring the real life beginning of how they were started. All in all Once Upon A Time Season One on Blu-Ray is definitely worth the buy, and I recommend those who haven't purchased this blu-ray or watched the show to do it! A great show, great performances, great drama, and simply amazing! Love this show, and I can't wait for Once Upon A Time Season Two to come out on blu-ray!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Human account of pre WWII and the rise of fascism in the world,along with socialists and communists. and the horror of WWII. Ken Follett is one the best on historical fiction today. You learn a lot while enjoying a good story.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I have to admit the last book in this series was full of evil and deadly horror. I liked the book. Our heroin the Mockingjay, is the symbol of the rebellion. Katniss our brave beautiful killing machine is in a violent world of war and deception and these series of events makes my head spin. A lot is going on. I'm happy she gets happy.  I would recommend reading.

B008EZVNO0|3.0|This CD is the perfect definition of something to put on and kick back to after you've had an especially rough day at work, and you want nothing more than to unwind with a gin-and-tonic, either at home or in a bar down the street from your workplace before heading home.  Nothing wrong with that, if that's all you want fom a Van CD.  Van's voice is still an instrument of wonder, but it's become quite obvious --- the days of musically challenging, thought-provoking work like the 'Astral Weeks', 'Moondance', 'St. Dominic's Preview' and 'Into the Music' albums are well behind Van.  This is lounge jazz-pop bordering on muzak.  What saves it (as usual) is Van's voice.  But there's nothing to really grasp on to here.  Whereas Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Neil Young still release albums that are thought-provoking work, Van has settled into being a sort-of white, B.B. King-like elder statesman.  That's OK if you you view music as wallpaper background for your day.  If you want something beyond that, however, this will inevitably disappoint.  It's not a bad album.  But by Van standards, it could have been much more.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|I must confess that I love this play and have seen it 6-7 times and thus cannot be totally objective. The presentation of Phantom on this DVD is wonderful! It takes the listener/watcher through the play and gives a close up and personal viewing. The production is first class. For the first time, I was able to understand every word and song, which can be dificult when seen in a theater. For anyone who enjoys this play, this DVD is a must!
0525953728|4.0|Before my review, I must say you are reading the review from the perspective of a 12 yrs Marine with 2 deployments to Iraq, and one deployment to Afghanistan as an Army bubba...i have done a few entries, raids, arrests and what not...masters and bachelors degree from two reputable colleges (not online)...not special forces, not secret squirrel...nothing...so with that out of the way, this was a really outstanding book.  336 pages all read in one day because the author did not use crazy military acronym that nobody understands.  He did not try to confuse  you with military jargon that is unique to specific units.  He wrote the book for the average person to understand.  He did not go into too much detail because that will risk the lives of other operators right now.<br /><br />Now why didn't I give it five stars?  Well that is basically because I think some of the subjects discussed in the book is sensitive (not classified but sensitive) and should not be talked about...And I can't give it five stars because I can't validate all the facts in the book as to how they really happened.  Did Obama really not bring these guys to the White House for some beers after he said he will?  That is sad IF IT REALLY HAPPENED...<br /><br />As to the motivations of the author, I don't know and I can't comment on that...What I can comment on is the fact that the book is a good read...He puts you in his shoes as he said he was going to try to do...so you can see it from his perspective.  That does not equate trying to over glorify himself or the teams.  These guys on the team do a job that none of us obviously can think of.  They put themselves into situations that will make us wet our pants. When they describe part of their job, its not because they think that they are a bunch of bad a$$es, its because that's what they do.  And being in the military for 14 yrs now, I must say Kudos to this guy for giving credit to everyone that supported the mission to get UBL.  Everyone including thepilots and the fuelers that were set up for refueling at a FARP in the middle of nowhere.  That is a first.<br /><br />This book is a good read.  It goes by quickly. You will not want to put it down.  And it will make you proud to be an American.  Too bad the author got so much flak for writing this.  I see why he did, but some of that information is public knowledge, however, I would prefer if it wasn't.  But that's why we all have freedom of speech.  Now considering that he signed a waiver as to not talking about missions, training, or what the team does, I think he is wrong.  But that is my opinion of the author NOT THE BOOK....

B006GM8NXM|5.0|I started watching this show on Netflix since I don't receive HBO at home.  I was hooked from the very first episode.  I would call it my guilty pleasure, but I don't feel guilty watching it.  It is a very creative show where every episode ends with a cliff hanger and leaves you wanting more.  I never read the books the series is based on, but based on other reviews the first season stays true to the books.  I bought this episode before finding a very reasonably priced boxed set on ebay. I like the extras that a boxed set can give you, but instant viewing episodes like this one from Amazon are good for when you are on-the-go.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a cool game as long as you like hidden objects I have been hooked on this game since I downloaded it
1600595871|2.0|I had hoped to learn how to make handmade books when I purchased this, but the author seems to have focused on adding a large number of TYPES of books to the repertoire while not really spending enough effort to describe any of them in detail. It's great (I guess) that there are 100 types of bindings, but the descriptions and diagrams for even the most simple ones are quite difficult to follow. She wastes a lot of type talking about her friends and who invented what, but when I try to follow the instructions I find them sketchy and poorly diagrammed. A ten-step process may have only one or two diagrams. Ten would be better.<br /><br />Often the author assumes knowledge that I don't have. For instance, she has a whole page devoted to making endbands, but she never explains what an endband IS. She also does not show a diagram of one in use. I suppose I could go to the web and get a lesson on that, but then why do I need the book?<br /><br />This might be a great text for a class taught by the author. As a stand-alone teaching aid it lacks substance.<br /><br />I found the book \\"Cover to Cover\\" by Shareen LaPlatz to be more useful. It is a smaller book with many fewer binding types, but each one is explained in clear detail with adequate drawings for each project.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|Some reviews said this movie makes you THINK? REALLY! Because its my opinion the crew of the Prometheus would of died from their own stupidity even if they had not encountered the alien. The alien seemed to be the only one in the movie that knew what it was doing.

B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I purchased the ATR3350 from Audio Technica via Amazon in June for a project I was going to start in late summer. When I opened the product and tested it out it did not work. I thought the battery might be dead so I bought a new one, nope, the mic just didn't work. I tested it on two different devices just to be certain.<br /><br />I looked at Amazon's return policy and since it had been over a couple of months (pretty short time if you ask me) I had no options for returns or exchanges. I'm just as upset at Amazon as I am at Audio-Technica.<br /><br />I checked Audio-Technica's return policy. Sure, you can send the product to them, pay for shipping to them and include an $8.00 shipping and handling fee for them to send you a replacement... I sure hope that one works. But in the end I would be paying $16 to exchange a $20 mic. Yeah, great deal. It appears both companies have poor customer service and no one to call. Consider carefully before purchasing.<br /><br />By the way, even if it did work, I would rate it lower for 2 reasons:<br />1) Getting the battery out to replace it is very difficult. I had to use needle nose pliers and work like hell to get it out.<br />2) There is no \\"on\\" indicator light, battery strength or anything else to indicate if the mic is working or not.

B006RXQ6FM|5.0|Like much great art, Doubt doesn't titillate, nor does it provide neat and tidy answers wrapped up in a package for the viewer. It tells a small little story, supported by amazing acting, and through it poses questions about what it means to truly know something, what can happen when we become utterly convinced that we are in the right, and what we do with all that damn mystery in the world. I've watched it several times, and it never gets old--because the questions at the center of it are timeless.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I love reading well written fantasy books and this is one of them!  The plot is tight. The characters believable.  No loose threads.  No disgusting, unnecessary sex scenes that some authors place to \\" spice up\\" the story.  I hope the next book is as good!  I can't wait!
0316228532|5.0|JK Rowling's first novel for adults is a complex, detailed portrait of an English village, told through the vehicle of a local election to fill the casual vacancy on the parish council left by the death of Barry Fairweather. Rowling has created a complete setting that feels very real, with a geography and history and society that make a concrete impression in the reader's mind. And she's populated it with a very diverse cast of characters (well, mostly white, if I'm honest, but diverse in background and personality) whose lives I really started to get wrapped up in.<br /><br />What it isn't is Harry Potter book eight, so if that's what you're looking for, you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for the same sort of detailed world-building found in the Potter books, however, you'll find that in spades. Only here, it's applied to the real world, not the fantastic.<br /><br />It's also not a clear-cut, straightforward tale with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Instead, it's a collection of the little moments that fill a particular period of time in a particular place. To a degree, it's got that in common with the Potter books as well, only here the small moments aren't broken up with epic battles against mythical creatures or snake-headed evil sorcerers. Make no mistake, however; this is still a book that tells a complete story. And it's a story that I found compelling and difficult to put down.<br /><br />I think that some fans may be disappointed at Rowling's shift from the epic to the everyday. And I don't know if that's an unfair feeling; up until now, being a JK Rowling fan was synonymous with being a Harry Potter fan. However, I hope those fans are reasonable enough to treat the book on its own merits, and acknowledge the difference between poor writing and unmet expectations. The writing here is every bit as good as her Harry Potter prose, only here it's in service to showing the small details of ordinary people living in an ordinary community. Shehasn't suddenly gotten any more flowery or poetic, just more down to earth.<br /><br />I'm a fan of stories about communities, where disparate people lead disparate lives, and instead of focusing on one character or one event, we see the stories of their connections. This is very much that kind of book, so I really enjoyed it. Just don't try to skip ahead to the next Quiddich match, or your heart will be broken.

B007549W62|1.0|First off i got the movie from walmart and wish i didnt spend my moms money. The story was intense indeed but left the viewer with more questions rather then answers. But having rape and other content was way over the top. Making fun of dooms day prepers doesn't help much either some of them arent nuts they are  trying to prepare incase something serious does go down in the future. The average person who would watch this movie would probably kringe and freak out maybe as a good shocker to think about the future but i feel the director should of went more towards a stronger story and show folks that some humans can survive the apocalypse if prepared right and with a solid mind. I would recommend you download this movie on netflix and then delete it real quick. One seen stuck in my head of rape and things isnt pleasent to think about. I threw my copy away in the trash cause it just didnt really seem right to me that they think humans are animals only with no sense of caring for one another. Bottom line i wanted to ask the director are you part of the new world order or did they tell you something we need to know? Instead look for a real good documentary like [...] alex jones movies or something!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I really wanted to like this case and thought that the idea of it was great! However, the screen did not fit tight against my screen, when made it feel like 1 big button. It really was not longer a touch screen, but rather a large button to push on. Also, I had a very difficult time hearing with the case on my phone. Everything was muffled.

B008E77AEK|5.0|After thoroughly enjoying Zero Day I couldn't wait for Trojan Horse to be released. Pre-purchased on Kindle I was enthusiastic (or perhaps 'sad') enough to keep hitting my available downloads to check for it on the day it was released.<br /><br />Once again Jeff and Daryl are chasing down cyber-terrorists to stop a major world changing event. Mark has again blended a good mix of plausible technical detail (for us geeks) and suspense/action.<br />I occasionally attempt other \\"cyber thriller\\" novels and I always walk away thinking the author either knows nothing about what's realistic or assumes the readers are dumb enough that they'll just accept what's being read. Mark doesn't make any of these mistakes, to me the scenario he presents is completely plausible (and scares me to bits).<br /><br />I'm also paranoid about my phones now.... (read Trojan Horse and you'll understand) :)<br /><br />I can't wait for #3!!!<br /><br />Ken

B007EC6FIS|5.0|I absolutely love Keane but to me they have never been able to recreate the magic of Hopes and Fears. Well, not until now.

B007X4ECMI|2.0|Sometimes you watch a movie and the \\"What were they thinking?\\" soundtrack plays in your mind.<br /><br />Well, clearly, with \\"Lockout\\", nobody was thinking. At all. It is genuinely, incomprehensively bad on every level.<br /><br />Apart from the lead characters who actually do a good job in this C-Grade sci-fi action-thriller. Guy Pearce, Maggie Grace and especially Vincent Regan have a lot of fun but the Universe they inhabit is so full of plot holes that it rips the heart out their credibility and if you have even a passing knowledge of sci-fi, your WTF meter will be dinging off the scale:<br /><br />* Artificial Gravity - WTF?<br />* A satellite prison where you do your time in statis - WTF?<br />* Amazing automation that runs the prison, yet they still have Human guards - WTF?<br />* Hundreds of armed space planes just sitting around waiting for action - WTF?<br /><br />I could go on but it would spoil the movie and even though it was really really bad, it's worth watching when you need a silly action movie that does not require too many neurons to light up to enjoy it.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I do recommend this headset if:<br /><br />* you like your ears to feel like they are hungover after gaming<br />* you need a disposable headset<br />* you need something to break to release your pent-up rage for about $70<br />* you need a long cord to strangle someone with<br /><br />I do not recommend this headset if:<br /><br />* you actually want a headset<br /><br />I sent in the first one that broke to Turtle Beach which they replaced; I guess the one star I'm giving can go to their customer service department. (You earned it!) The replacement headset broke in the same exact spot, the swivel joint as other reviewers have mentioned. I repaired it by bracing the joint with a plastic spoon and wrapping it in silicone tape. Whilst repairing the joint, the other side broke in the same fashion. I decided to switch it up and used epoxy cement and electrical tape on that side. Even though both sides no longer swivel, I believe I have made an improvement to the product and would like to be compensated for my efforts by Turtle Beach.

I would enCOURAGE any single guy out there to at least take the time to watch it.

B0010SKSTO|5.0|Love this book, it allows the reader to slowly absorb all the information contained within its' pages.  And, I've started really concentrating on 'reading' my surroundings, trying to become more focused as suggested in this book.  So far I'm fairly impressed and amazed at all the things I've missed on a regular basis.  Highly recommend this book!!!!
B001QITO52|5.0|My favorite song out of the album is \\"On The Turning Away\\" or \\"Sorrow\\". Like all Pink Floyd albums in my opinion (Excluding Piper at The Gates of Dawn). The songs are ordered the way they are for a reason. The first time you listen to it you have to listen to all the songs in order. I always think of it as just one long song. Probably my third favorite Prog Rock album behind Animals and Moving Pictures.

0545123275|2.0|Grace was attacked by wolves at a very young age and probably would have become wolf meat if the mysterious yellow eyed wolf hadn't saved her. Six years later and that same yellow eyed wolf still watches Grace from the woods behind her house. I picked this book because a lot of people compare it to the book Twilight because of all the werewolves in this book. This book is NOTHING like Twilight. First of all there are no vampires, and second Twilight was a book that kept you on your toes kept you wanting more, this book was just boring. I felt like the only reason I continued to read it was because I was hoping something exciting would happen. This book needs more action more cliffhangers, from all that I have read the only cliffhanger in this book is at the end when they (Sam the yellow eyed wolf and Grace) found a cure to being a wolf. I also thought it was weird of how the wolves changed into human when it was warm and back into a wolf when it was cold, I mean unless you wanted to change into a wolf every year why would you live in a place that turns freezing cold in the winter. You'd think it would be the wolves' top priority to try and stop them from turning into a wolf ever year. I know in the book they said that some of the wolves went up to Canada (where it's warm) to try and stay human, but then it says that when they past an air-conditioned place that they immediately turned into a wolf. to me that sounded kind of stupid, for one thing the author keeps suggesting in the book that you have to be very cold to be able to turn into a wolf, and I'm pretty sure you're not going to be that cold if it's humid outside and you get a blast of cold air in the face. I think the author needed to put more thought of how and when they should they should turn back and forth to human and wolf. I did like however the way the author wrote it so that you had the point of view from both characters, so that you could have different reactions to how both of the characters looked at things. The only thing I didn't like about that was that sometimes I got mixed up with which point of view I was reading. I liked a lot of the authors wording too, but sometimes it seemed she just went a little over the top and was a little too dramatic. I really liked the characters back round stories too and all of the emotional meaning it has behind them. Like in Sam's back round story his parents tried to kill him by slitting hid wrist after they saw him change into a wolf, because they thought he was possessed by the devil. When this was said in the book it really tore at my heart and I could finally understand how the tiniest shred of good news or hope could bring him such happiness. Grace's story isn't as heartfelt as Sam's but still makes me feel sad either way. In her story Grace practically raises herself, with her parents being barely home. You'd think that after you almost died twice (1. She gets attacked by wolves 2. Her dad forgets her in the car when she fell asleep to bake in the heat) your parents would show a little sympathy or compassion toward you, but not Grace's they just forget about it and move on. So I think it's really sweet how these two characters find each other after all they've been through. I think the author knew her audience well, she obviously wrote this book for young teens like me, but if you're looking for an exciting read I would keep looking, because you'll probably get bored with this book within the first fifteen chapters (there are sixty-seven chapters in this book).
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|This may very well be Stanley Kubrick's most perfect movie from start to finish. It has a subtle laugh-out-loud humor that comes organically from the characters and how they're played. Sellers is amazing in all 3 roles and George Scott and Sterling Hayden shine in supporting roles. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and take a couple hours to enjoy one of the best films ever made.
B008966SIU|5.0|Grizzly Bear have made a reputation for themselves as being a precise, meticulous and at times very uptight and stuffy rock band. I use the term 'rock band' very loosely as well. Go back and listen to Yellow House and Veckatimest and tell me with a straight face that those two albums are rock albums. Do it.  I dare you. Listen, I'm not putting down Grizzly Bear because the fact of the matter is that I love Grizzly Bear. They create mood, emotion(in a truncated way) and an atmosphere of grandiosity within their chamber pop songs. It's like the Brodsky Quartet scoring an Ingmar Bergman film. It's just that in the past the guys in Grizzly Bear, while making very emotional and powerful music, had a tendency to keep the listener at arms length. You felt that there was something more they wanted to say, but out of embarrassment or fear of sharing too much and scaring us away they cut their message short and clammed up just when they were getting to the point.<br /><br />Well, the overly shy and introverted Grizzly Bear is no more. With Shields, Grizzly Bear's fourth full-length, they have made their most open, loose and absolute best album to date.<br /><br />'Sleeping Ute' opens the album with a  wild, drunken sway. Folksy and musty, this song gives off the feel of history. It has the smell of old leather and the cold sea air. This song grooves and breathes like no other Grizzly Bear song up to this point. It reminds me of CSNY's 'Wooden Ships' but leaner and more direct. It's a song that looks at you eye-to-eye, never looking off to the side. 'A Simple Answer' is another track that you would've never heard on a Grizzly Bear album up to this point. A driving tom-filled beat, with Rossen singing \\"Those saints in Lockstead/Across the wasteland/Forever gone/They're home and walk along\\", you get a bit of story telling in this very pop-inflected song. It's such a carefree song that you almost forget who you're listening to.<br /><br />Rossen isn't the only one to undo the top button on his neatly pressed shirt and loosen his tie. Ed Droste sings us some great songs within this great album. 'Gun-Shy' is a breezy, head swaying pop song. It feels as if Droste has decided to not be so serious and enjoy the fact that he actually has a 'band' now. He needn't compose with the idea that these songs are being written for just his ears. He's taking full advantage of the fact that he's got an amazing band to fill out his quiet pop songs. 'Yet Again' has the emotional heft we've grown to love about a Grizzly Bear song, except with more of a heart-on-his-sleeve honesty in Droste's voice. Droste sounds like he's pulling these songs from his heart, not his head.<br /><br />Opening the windows and letting some fresh air and perspective within the Grizzly Bear band dynamic has opened them up to new possibilities. No longer do they sound meticulous and carefully planned. They sound relaxed and loose. They don't sound like an art rock project or an indie rock string quartet. They sound like a band that loves what they do. And we're the better for it.button on his neatly pressed shirt and loosen his tie. Ed Droste sings us some great songs within this great album.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Some second books are about repeating the first book with a different storyline ( boring) This book dives deeper into the characters and who they are we see their actions coming to life and the match their words of who they truly are as people. Can't wait until Dec for the third book.
B0090EIILU|2.0|While I normally give every movie I see a chance, regardless of how the trailer makes it look, something about the previews for The Dictator had me wanting to not see it at all. Sacha Baron Cohen's earlier work like Da Ali G Show and Borat were great, and Bruno was alright for what it was, but it seemed like with The Dictator, he wasn't making any progress with his comedy. More Middle Eastern jokes, more \\"offensive\\" jokes that are boring most of the time, why not try something different? The movie had this self-aware feeling like they were writing jokes with a \\"hey, isn't this funny?!\\" mentality instead of going for more genuine humor. I just plain didn't like this movie, and it hurts to say that since I know Cohen can do so much more given the right material and setup. When it comes down to it, if you've seen his other movies and Da Ali G Show, then you've seen most of what's here. If you haven't...I suggest watching those instead. The Dictator will most likely only appeal to people who still get shocked at politically incorrect humor.<br /><br />Aladeen is the dictator of the [fictional] country of Wadiya, ruling over it with an iron fist. Whatever he wants, he gets. Be it a nuclear bomb that's pointy instead of round, winning a race against professional runners, or changing a couple of words to his own name. He has a tendency to have people executed whenever they do something that bugs him even in the tiniest bit, and as such, no one likes him. Aladeen travels to America to talk with the United Nations, but he's kidnapped and shaved soon after his arrival. They replace the dictator with a lookalike, despite the man being mentally challenged, and plan on having him sign a document that would bring democracy to Wadiya, opening the country's oil fields up for business. Homeless and without any friends, Aladeen befriends (for lack of better word) Zoey, an activist who works at one of those all-natural shops that activists love to go to so much. It just so happens that her store is catering the hotel that Aladeen's replacement is staying at. This won't be pretty.<br /><br />I'll get the things I liked about the movie out of the way first. Jason Mantzoukas, who plays Nadal, former chief of Wadiya's nuclear weapons program, provided most of the laughs for me. Whenever he'd get irritated at Aladeen's obliviousness to logic and basic instructions, it was funny. Unfortunately there's a good amount of time that goes on without the guy after he's introduced, but when he comes back, it's good. The other main thing is a speech that Aladeen gives towards the end of the movie. I was just about to write it off as a waste of time until that moment. Aladeen talks about many things that are wrong with America, and you can't help but go \\"...yeah, he's right\\" during this segment. The speech isn't delivered with a very serious tone, yet everything he says is true. There's also the infamous helicopter scene from the trailer, and it still made me laugh when it came up.<br /><br />...that does it for things I liked.<br /><br />Everything else about the movie is a flop. Jokes go on forever and don't know when to end, especially those with Bobby Lee, whose character is so forced into the movie that everything he does seems out of place. Some scenes are so drawn out that I was wondering if the movie was trying to be taken seriously all of a sudden because the attempts at comedy were suddenly gone. Aladeen just plain isn't an interesting character either, and comes off as Borat with authority more than anything else. It got old whenever he'd be talking about something sexual, and replace words for organs or actions with those in his language. The editing in The Dictator is pretty awful too, and it's clear that a lot of scenes were cut from the movie. You can see for yourself if you watch the trailer before or after watching the movie.  As for the politically incorrect-ness of the comedy here, none of it offended me in the way it might offend most people. No, what offended me was how hard they were trying to get a shock out of the viewer. Not since Carlos Mencia's show, Mind of Mencia, have I seen such a sad, forced attempt at surprising audiences with what was being said. Didn't any of the writers or anyone else have the guts to step forward and say something like 'hey guys, maybe we should stop with all this and write something more original'? I've seen the movie twice now, with the most recent viewing being 4 days ago, and I barely remember any of the jokes. How can the guy behind the genius Da Ali G Show be so desperate for a reaction now?<br /><br />The Dictator will be one of those movies that will fade from my memory in a couple of months. It's not the worst movie I've seen all year, just the most disappointing. This was a big missed opportunity. I'm really hoping that Cohen can come back with something great in the next year or two.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put this down, I had to find out how exactly their relationship was going to work out. Just when I thought the author was going in one direction I was blindsided by a different event. I am curious though, what role is Corinne going to play in the third book because you know she is going to try something. Also, it was good to see that Eva is finally getting a stronger backbone towards Gideon. The payback she plans on him is great, I laughed at it a couple of times. Definately worth the read, especially if you liked the first one. The final in this trilogy couldn't get here soon enough.

Strong four stars out of five for me.

B009CPJHY4|1.0|It started out like it had potential with all these what I thought might be interesting and funny old people that are (some) well known actors.  Was still trying to figure out why they would all be going to India as they were not of the poor appearance nor did they do their due diligence on the resort.  The resort definitely looked like a dump when they got there and I doubt I could have stayed there one night, especially if not secure and no closed windows.  And I hate to say it, but how come they have to make one of the main characters a life long gay man who is looking for a love from his past, and his life depends on it or whatever.  Not to be so harsh on the gay population but sorry, I can not relate to it.  There was possibly some good acting, but I could not get past the sad and doomed story line to enjoy any of it.  Even the romance between to two native Indian love birds looked like it could fall to pieces any moment as well.  What I hate most of all is all the large number of positive reviews, so I guess I will be more cautious next time I rent a movie on Amazon, but thankful I did not buy the movie too.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|I loved the first book in this series, however Reflected in You fell flat for me. I was so annoyed by the ups and downs, with no real resolution to any of Eva and Gideon's problems!! I forced myself to power through hoping the book would get better. The end was okay, but nothing powerful or earth shattering. Hopefully, the next book will get my heart racing!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Absolutely enjoyed this book! It goes a little deeper into the psyche. A lot of people will compare it to 50 shades, but give it a chance, you will love it....the second book is super intense!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This review is mostly advice to help with issues on the Kindle version of the book.<br />I pre-ordered the book, but didn't read it as soon as I got it.  I started it Wednesday and yesterday it freezes on my Kindle Fire- at 51%.  I called Customer Service and she sent me the \\"updated\\" version, but it still froze.  To anyone who ordered the book on Kindle Fire or Kindle, you can go to Manage My Kindle and in the library list- go to Actions.  There should be a link to the updated version there.  So, the new version she sends me still froze.  I deleted it from the device, downloaded it to my laptop and transferred it via USB.  It still didn't allow me to scroll across that frozen page so I didn't see what immediately happened after that page, but I was able to go past that location and read without it freezing.  If anyone has an issue with it, then this should help.  Also, I recommend you turn it off by holding the button down for 20 sec and then powering up before transferring the new version.<br /><br />I haven't finished yet (at 75%)- but it's GREAT so far.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Its was a moving story. i would not mind find a hot fifty shades stud like that!!!! anyone should read it!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was concerned that the book might reveal classified information. I don't believe that to be the case. It was partially autobiographical about the authors life as a Navy Seal as well as being focused on the Bin Laden mission. It gives a good description of what it is to be a Seal and part of a highly skilled team. A very good read.
B008QE9VJI|1.0|Horrible movie. I loved the TV show back in the day, but this was not good.  I really like Depp, and he did the best he could with the bad script, but don;t waste your money.
B0034G4OZE|4.0|If you're put off by the theme - characters in a psychiatric ward who have suicidal thoughts - don't be.  This is in fact a very funny movie, as well as a moving and thoughtful one, with excellent performances by Zach Galifianakis and Keir Gilchrist.  Highly recommended.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's My Perry? is a cute and fun app that I downloaded for my Kindle Fire. My 5 year old grandson loves it! I enjoy it too!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is super fun and I have a lot of utilities on it and games to play and the games
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I have a hard time 'sticking' with some e-books - this book was definitely hard to put down.  The ending was a surprise I didn't expect.  The pace, for the most part, was fast.  Other than a couple of loose ends - like escape attempts that I missed - I really liked the book.

B009B2U73I|5.0|I love all her releases and this one is no different. Sure its not jazzy and all but you can tell the influence is there. Feet tapping music with salon atmosphere and that sexy voice!!!<br />Will be buying the vinyl too.<br /><br />For those complaining about her appearance, if you look on the web, she has stated that it was to represent the period she was singing. If you dont like, get over it.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book grabbed me and didn't let me go. I'm onto the second one which I'm told is even better.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I am anxiously. awaiting the sequel. Good story, good puzzles, and good hidden object games. One of the best I've played!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The no limit music storage is killer. I have nearly 50000 songs and amazon mp3 is the only cloud that allows unlimited music storage (that I know of) and 50gb of space for your files other than music. And all this only costs 20$ a year. It's incredible! I love my amazon mp3.
B007MD2RHC|5.0|If you're looking for music that evokes a feeling of hopefulness, of transcending time and space, of fearlessness, of love, then you should buy this cd.  I came across Thomas Bergersen after hearing the track on this cd called \\"Sonera\\" on a trailer for a movie called \\"Cloud Atlas\\".  That 5 minute trailer exposed me to such music that I knew immediately that I had to have it.  I couldn't just find that track on some website and just download it.  I felt that I had to support the man who created it.  I have come to love the entire cd.  This is something that rarely happens.  So, would I recommend this album?  Yes, a million times yes.
B004MMEF30|5.0|My grandaughter needed this book for school.  Instead of trying to find one in the book stores, I had her download it on her Kindle.  Fast, easy and it made me look good to my grandaughter.  The purchase was a bargain at $0.99.  She reviewed the book, got an A on the assignment and all is well in Houston.....Buy a Kindle...download book assignments and be a hero to your family.<br />m
B003O86FMW|5.0|aw some!  this book was better than the first one. I especially liked the pace.  This book was non stop action.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Absoultey love SOA. Best show on television!! I often go back to previous seasons & watch them again. Ready to purchase season 5.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Interesting movie with interesting theme and nice visual effects.  Its not the kind of movie I can sit and watch over and over but it served its purpose.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|My take on it is that Van has been making records for a long time. He knows what he wants to play and say, and how he wants to play and say it. He's a music snob, passing judgemet on what is transcendebt and what is fake or unworthy. He's not right about that but he can only feel it one way. He can only sing about what is making him write that next song. He can only lead whatever band he's got togethr to make the kind of music that feels right to him. You get what you get from him, take it or leave it. It' not gonna be what it was. It's not gonna be what you REALLY want. He has, at least for now, reached a place of: mixing a little insight with some bitching about his problems, putting the message to mostly smooth-ish, soulful tunes usually played in an understated but deceptivey inventive way, with some really nice horn solos. You can kind of relate to the lyrics but not as much as you imagine. Repeated listens blur the words into the music and it's much more about the sound than the message. The voice is utterly unique,still, and an instruement in it's own right. It sounds better each time you listen. But you are aware of something that happened before that doesn't seem to happen anymore, or at least not as often. But then again what is there now was not there before, and anyway nobody else can give you the same thing. And you can always go back and hear what was before, and before that if you want to. And you do. Don't think too much though. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah....
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|good storyline and graphics.  definitely hard to put down.  very addicting.  worked great with kindle.  looking forward to the next enigmatis game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I got this as an e-book on my Kindle on my android phone.  I enjoyed it very much and ordered the consecutive books as soon as I finished the one before it.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Great premise and unique structure to this fast reading novel about intertwined lives connected through the music industry. Looking foward to my second time through.
0316228532|5.0|I have been having a bit of a laugh by reading all the negative reviews on Amazon. Firstly, we had a whole lot of people whinging about the ebook price. Now, we have a whole lot criticising its 'filthy' language.<br /><br />This particular review takes the top prize (I have copy pasted it from Amazon)....<br />\\"Customer Review<br /><br /> My 8 year old read this, I am disgusted by all the sex and drug use., September 27, 2012<br />By J. Mangine<br />This review is from: The Casual Vacancy (Hardcover)<br />It was my 8 year old daughters birthday and I happened to be in my local book store. I saw this in a display and thought \\"...Wow, she wrote the Harry Potter series, my daughter Ophelia would love this\\".<br />Anyway, I wrapped it up and gave it to her.<br />Next thing I knew she asked me questions about drugs and sex..she said they were in the book I bought for her birthday.<br /><br />I feel that her childhood is gone now.<br />This book should be sold BEHIND the counter so people know its not for children.<br /><br />How can we expect our children to grow up happy and healthy when filth is all around? \\"<br /><br />Does America really have such a large number of prudes?<br /><br />Coming back to the book, let me add here that I interrupted my Booker Prize Shortlist Reading Challenge, to read 'The Casual Vacancy'. As I have been reading a lot of literary fiction, I can confidently say that 'The Casual Vacancy' is a literary book. It takes a master story teller to take snapshots of everyday life with all its ordinariness, ugliness, pain and heartbreak and weave into a page turning exciting read. In spite of all the prudes, Rowling has triumphed once again.<br /><br />I have a feeling that if this book had not come with the Rowling brand and had been written by someone like say Zadie Smith, the very people who have been criticising this book (the lit-critics) might have celebrated it.<br /><br />PS - I will be posting a detailed review once I have completed my BookerReading Challenge.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I have not opened the collection because I watched the series and loved every minute of it!  Too bad his name is not on the ballot as he would WIN in a landslide.  This is a gift for a cranky Republican with whom I have been arguing about the 2012<br />campaign!  This will enlighten him--he never watched THE WEST WING but I'll just bet that he'll change his vote asap after<br />watching what a good President does in office.  I'm voting \\"more of the same\\" but still wish I could be voting for Bartlett<br />and be living in another time which was less stressful.  Blessings to us all.........!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a fun read, particluarly great for someone who likes the law & order genre. It goes by fast and keeps you guessing and wondering.  The ending was unsatisfying, personally, but worked for the book and didn't take away from the read.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much and look forward to seeing the movie. The ending caught me by surprise. I have recommended this book to my friends as a good book to read.
0307269752|5.0|I received this item within two weeks via US mail.  It was carefully wrapped and the condition of the book was exactly as described--EXCELLENT CONDITION--like a new book.  I very much enjoyed the book and pleased that it was in the condition as advertised.
0374214913|5.0|\\"Old Knowlege accounts for most things that most people know, and have ever known\\". It's in a lot of old books.  So how do you transfer that unto the Internet?  How can Google account for it? And if they can, will we achieve the Singularity when computer learning takes over in a vertical line and we all achieve immortality.<br />Clay addresses these questions when he starts work at Mr. Penumbra's book store.  The 24 hour store, open all the time like the Internet.  This is an intriguing book, full of classical allusions like all the best science fiction.  Penumbra, the shadowed rim of an object in eclipse.  We learn about a famous printer who printed the classics, a real guy, Manutius.  He printed in the code bearing best font, Gerrtszoon.  He isn't a real guy as far as I can tell, but this is the real name of Erasmus, the greatest scholar of the Renaissance, who taught among other, Henry the VIII and edited the New Testament.  This book is full of these references and I enjoyed hunting them down.<br />It made me think, passed the time well, and drew some fascinating characters.  A perfect book for those of us who love real books and still plunder the Internet and carry a Kindle!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun I'm so addicted to it I've only reached. to 22,430 meters but I'm glad to play this game.
0439023521|5.0|This is an intense riveting tale that always keeps you at the edge of your seat. The main characters Katniss, Gale, and Peeta are nicely developed throughout the book and as they progress throughout the series, in a good but also bad way. You can't help but sympathize with each of them, it is terrible to think if you had to have a young family member have to participate in a terrible event such as The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Brutal, some of the scenes in the book could be pretty violent, I was surprised how violent and gruesome it got but I never wanted to put it down. You felt as if you were right along side, Katniss in her terrifying adventure.<br /><br />Although this book can be terrible in different ways I don't think there was one part I didn't like. Suzanne did a beautiful job and I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone. Although kids should be over the age of 13 and no one squeamish should attempt to read this either.
B0042UFWES|5.0|I bought the original on vinyl on the afternoon of Dec. 8, 1980, but didn't have a chance to listen to it that day. By the next day, I didn't have the heart to listen to it. I went back to the music store, still hoping that it was all a mistake. I stood in the middle of the store, with hundreds of others, listening to the tracks on the store sound system. I wasn't the only one crying.<br /><br />Eventually, of course, I listened, and loved it - even the Yoko tracks. This new version, this Stripped Down mix is wonderful, cleaner, crisper, and much more personal, more intimate than the original recordings. Of course, with the original songs included, this is something very much like a great value. A must for all music fans.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|The acting is fabulous but the message is very depressing. Difficult to follow character roles but I won't watch again to figure out the story.
0525953728|5.0|Being a veteran, I know the spin politicians put on any operation.. I want first hand information. This book gives as much as it can. Solid copy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this second book in the trilogy!  Mr. Follett really has tied all the loose ends together and the families have become more interesting, especially their ultimate interactions.  Can't wait for the third book to be released!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Omg that all i have to say i am ready for the next book you need to hurry up lol love it
B008532S54|4.0|Very funny. Now I want to be a hippy!!! I wonder if Alan Alda ownes a place like this in Montana? If so that would be perfection!!!
B000TJ6CPY|5.0|A dear friend had recommended this to me, since I have a great interest in Jazz. And it is one of Oscar Peterson's best. Several originals by Oscar and Clark Terry ( the + One in the title) make this a marvelous effort from a very under rated group of musicians. If you like Jazz, and don't have this, you should think about getting it. There are some other Oscar Peterson efforts that are quite good, but this is solid.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn did an amazing job with this novel. I love mysteries and this one kept you so engaged the entire time. There are so many surprise twists and turns and the ending is just as shocking. I didn't want it to end.
B005CM9DX6|1.0|I love Opeth. Really, I do. But this is just wrong. Seriously, this album is actually painful. Literally. I know what \\"literally\\" means: I damaged my rotator cuff when I violently ripped it out of the CD player and flung it at the help. You will face federal prosecution if you come within 100 feet of a school with this album in your possession. Star rating? Amazon should have a collapsed star/black hole system available for rating this kind of album. Just looking at it makes my eyes bleed, nevermind listening to it. Don't reward Opeth for this - they know better. If you feel a burning need to buy an Opeth album this very minute, buy...well, basically ANYTHING ELSE of theirs. If you already have the whole catalog, go buy another version of Blackwater Park, there's like two dozen variations on content and packaging available out there.<br /><br />If you still think you want this, go search Amazon's $5 deal page instead. There are lots of bad prog-rock albums there much cheaper. If you get five bad prog-rock albums, you qualify for free shipping! Some washed-up prog-rock guys will get royalty checks for a nickel! Opeth does not get rewarded for...whatever this was supposed to be (Music? Lost bet? Practical joke?)! Everybody wins!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I'm in the middle of reading it on my Kindle App on my Droid 2 Global and at 51% it's crashing repeatedly. I'm extremely frustrated! I've only read a couple other reviews and the crashing complaints seem to be on the Kindle Fire. I would give it a 5 star but this middle of the book crashing thing is NOT cool.<br /><br />The book itself so far is really good. I'm still wrapping my head around all the characters and their relationships and baggage. I would almost say it's too many main characters but they're all starting to hold their own. If I can't read more by tomorrow I'm refunding though. This is ridiculous.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book and I am so ready for the final book in this series. I love Eva and Gideon and can't wait for Brett to show up and rock the boat. At least thats what I expect to happen! Wonderfully written by Silvia Day and I hope she keeps them coming because I am a fan.
B008966SLM|5.0|I have several efforts from Robert Cray dating all the way back to 1985, but I still don't know what to expect from Robert except that it will be good. This new effort does not fail that test. He still can play that guitar so well and so fresh. The entire CD is great, with \\"Won't Be Coming Home\\",\\"I'll Always remember You\\",\\"I'm Done Cryin'\\", and \\"Blues Get Off My Shoulder\\" and perfect for the blues. And check out \\"Worry\\". Very interesting song. As I said, I have many efforts from Mr. Cray, but I do recommend this to anyone who hasn't heard of Robert (say it is NOT SO!). Thanks again Robert Cray for some real saucy blues. Awesome!
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I was really impressed with the book!  I read it in about two days while traveling and am very glad I did.  I am runner who has run 4 half marathons and am constantly on the verge of injury and working to stay motivated.  This book came at the right time for me!  I learned a little about myself, it brought me closer to my wife (who has MS), it endeared me to my hobby of being a runner and has lead me to being a healthier person in seeking out more veggies in my diet.  I mean, I don't credit the book for everything, but the words of Scott and the way he tells his story as he progressed through school, his experiences running multiple ultras and even being in \\"Born to Run\\" was very inspiring and enjoyable.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in running any distance.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is sooooooo cool!!! I didn't really think I would like this game but its really cool. its just soooo addicting. I would definately recommend this app
1593157134|5.0|Getting and staying on tract with my dream of becoming free from everyday worries of where and when my bills, necessities and wants in life will come from. I've long awaited for something of this magnitude. Anyone who have doubts of where to go from here can wrap their brain around what is read in this book.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|After The Resistance this album is definitely following on the trend that Muse set.  The loud guitars and heavy bass have dwindled even more on this record, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great album, just different.  A lot of Muse's pre-release press hinted at the fact that they were going to change their sound on the new album and it shows.  After 3 listens through I am hooked and currently this album is competing with Babel for my ear time.<br />Favorite tracks<br /> Madness, Unsustainable, Survival.
B000062X90|5.0|I bought this as a replacement for the Album I had which was wore down to the core. This was the best Wishbone Ash effort, with Andy Powell and Ted Turner at their best, before Ted suddenly left. The CD has great liner notes, with better descriptions of each song done better than I could do in my dreams. \\"Time Was\\", \\"The King Will Come\\" and \\"Warrior\\" are classics. Most of my friends have this in one form or another. I recommend this to all who want to rock, because you will, and will remember what a great album it was.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It definitely lived up to my expectations and I could not put it down.  Prepare to be completely captivated,as you enter The Hunger Games.  I am certainly hungry for more.
0525953728|5.0|This is a first class account by the participants.it has been vetted by competent authority.  The Administration is running from the truth as displayed in the first person narrative.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|My wife loves to spend two hours a day listening to these guys.  Not me, although they are classy, I'm getting a little tired of them.  I forgot to mention, she has the CDs in the car too.
B000JMKO3C|5.0|This book gave me a lot of food for thought.  It enlightened me as to how various parents, both currently and in the past, as well as in other countries, reacted to their children who were more interested in following their own artistic paths in life rather than the \\"sensible\\" ones their parents had laid out for them.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I enjoy following people that I admire and respect along with receiving updates about current events that might not make it to the regular media outlet.This is my first and only social media forum and I am loving it, Twitter can be tailored to your personal likes and enterests just perfect for me.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I first heard the song \\"Gabriel's Oboe,\\" from the movie \\"The Mission,\\" on my local classical music radio station. I was so taken by the emotion, depair and hope that the music portrayed that I wanted to hear more from Yo-Yo Ma and the composer, Ennio Morricone. For those interested in the use of \\"classical\\" music in \\"movie\\" music, this selection is a very good one. I have been most pleased with the purchase. It has, quickly, become one of my favorite CDs.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Seriously, I mean it: get this out in paperback and you will be able to quit your day job and focus on squeezing the sequels out rapidly.<br /><br />The way I write reviews, I have to imagine that the pinnacles of this genre deserve six stars. That way, I am able to give five star ratings to books not written by Scott Bakker or GRRM. Raven's shadow is pretty close to them, and definitely on par with another of my recent favorites: The Name of the Wind by Rothfuss.<br /><br />This story is huge, and what starts as a good coming-of-age novel soon transforms into a full epic saga with a great handling of character growth, politics and magic.<br /><br />In one way I think you can rate a book by the number of memorable scenes. This book has a vast number of them. It is not your typical self-published cheap eBook, that has carefully been cut up in shorter stories to maximize the revenue potential. This is a huge work of great quality. It should be in airports everywhere.
0307341550|4.0|Some books are just decadent.  Sharp Objects is more a depraved horror book than a true mystery.  I am not going to pick apart flaws that are in the book.  Sharp Objects is dark and filled with morally bankrupt characters, yet the book flows forward with increasing voyeurism that I couldn't turn away from.  The perfect movie version of this book would star:<br />Adora:  Joan Crawford<br />Amma:  Patty McCormack (yes, the little girl in the Bad Seed)<br />Camille: Rooney Mara<br />Alan:  Donald Sutherland.<br /><br />The great thing about books is the imagination.  Obviously you can't put those actors together today but it is mighty fun to think of what it would have looked like on screen.<br />It's October, the weather is getting cooler, the days shorter, Halloween is coming.  If you enjoy creepy, read Sharp Objects!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I love seeing a movie that most regular people could not make even if they tried.So many movies nowadays seem so low budget that it feels like anyone with a camcorder and a decent dialog could film it. Not this movie! It took you to exotic places around the world and gave you the ride of your life. Loved the exotic feel and the music was nostalgic. Great escape from the mundane!
B004SYP5WC|5.0|It was not too difficult to learn the interface to this app. It's attractive and functions well. I like that the Icon doesn't give away the true nature of the app in case of prying eyes. Once I had it properly set up, and, yes, there is a wee bit of a learning curve, but nothing daunting, it functioned like a champ.<br /><br />I spend so much time on my Kindle that I never saw the reminders on my computer anymore. Now, once again, I don't have to worry about accidentally overlooking something.
B00884GR0W|3.0|This game is not nearly as polished as Minecraft, Minecraft is smooth as butter on my Xoom, this game runs slower.<br /><br />There is however a huge difference, that being, seeds are infinite up and down and in all directions, LOTS of content and monsters. Just a lot more to do, Minecraft PE is beta though, this is more of a full release.<br /><br />One suggestion, please increase the viewing distance, I realize this is a huge programming undertaking and there are a lot of variables involved such as hardware. But please make it so you can make the view distance VERY large so I can see these immense and cool landscapes. Even at full viewing distance I can only see a very small distance. Maybe add more options that I can turn off or down in order for my machine to handle the extra distance.<br /><br />The 4.1 update was giving me some issues getting stuck in some places but need to test more to figure out why.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This books gave me another perspective on economic changes made by rapid technology grow. How things we are enjoying can(are?) causing societies to worry. Those changes can affect future political views of nations, can destroy whole civil pace. Everything depend on us. It's worth to know how the world we are living in is working and changing, what can we do, what problems we are going to stand against.
B0058PJ6NE|3.0|I haven't bought this app and I originally wouldn't be here but I have been having problems with the free ver. whitch I just found out today is no longer here so if possible please bring back the free ver. or at least judging by the other reviews upgrade this ver.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun to play, challenging and a good time waster! Highly recommended if you like games that make you think.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel is just so well-written. You learn something new about Amy and Nick with every chapter. And then when you're done, you have to re-read it. It's a MUST! It picks up the pace and then you start not only questioning the characters' motivations, but you start to question everything you've just read. I highly recommend it.
0312430000|5.0|Everyone writes checklists. People generate lists of things to do. Grocery lists. Packing lists. Bucket lists.<br /><br />How do you write a good checklist, however?<br /><br />One reviewer wondered about the necessity of a book when, he supposed, a magazine article might suffice.<br /><br />He missed most of the point the author was trying to make. The checklist is an underrated powerful tool. When used correctly and deftly the results can be life changing. This book offers valuable insight on what works and doesn't work when designing a checklist both implicitly and explicitly through examples.<br /><br />Anyone who has worked in health care, the military or in any other technical business has undoubtedly seen ponderous technical manuals. They're not what you need to be reading in a crisis. A well-designed checklist can help professionals tackle the most onerous, vexing problems and see them through to success.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|after my alarm clock broke I had to have my mom wake me up each day. with this it wakes me up guarenteed on time and you can set it so it repeats on weekends or weekdays. it also has a way that makes the alarm start soft and gradually get louder. I thought this app wa better than the other alarm click apps, so I kept it. best alarm clock app you can get for kindle fire for free.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am obsessed with Pinterest. So I was really excited to see that they made a Fire app. It works great for me. Though once in awhile it'll not start up so the force close box comes up. I try it again, and it works fine.

B0053O89WY|5.0|I just find this show so funny.  Not sure how many more seasons they can keep going.  This is just another funny season with lots of Sheldonisms, and I just love seeing Blossom again!  What a talent she is.
0156034026|3.0|The story is intriguing enough to keep you interested as it's a short book but I agree with other reviewers that the narrator's pretentious tone is irritating and distracting.

B007F7RRNY|4.0|I found this to be a well-written, engaging critique of the contradictions of modern Indian economic growth.  Portrays the realities of a highly polarized, class-based \\"dog-eat-dog\\" society, but you can't help rooting for the underdog hero.

B000OVLBIU|4.0|Note: I have two Blue-ray/ DVD players. One is \\"Region A or 1\\" (the norm in the US) and the other is \\"Region Free\\" so that I can play anything I want in it (including Region A's or 1's).  My Panasonic \\"Region Free\\" is only about a year old.<br /><br />This Blue-ray disk has great a picture & sound.  How good the movie is I leave up to each person.  However, I do have a WARNING for everyone.<br /><br />I just discovered that some of the \\"Region A or 1\\" Blue-ray disks that I bought on \\"Amazon\\" will not play in my \\"Region Free\\" player.  But they play just fine in \\"Region A or 1\\" player.<br /><br />Most of the disks that will not play in my \\"Region Free\\" player will display a \\"Fox\\" back ground with a message that reads [the disk will play in a \\"Region A\\" player only] on the screen after you insert the disk.  The others that will not play in \\"Region Free\\" player have different backgrounds with a similar massage.<br /><br />*****This Blue-ray disk happens to have this problem!<br /><br />Since I have one of each this is not a problem for me, but I thought it would be useful to know for those who might only have a \\"Region Free\\" player.
0375842209|5.0|When I first started this book I got easily confused but now I am really enjoying it. I have not finished yet, about half way through, and it gets better every time I pick it up!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This is a great twist on the old fairy tale with some great actors that seem to be out of their element in this movie.  The Wicked Queen played by Charlize Theron is on where a great actress has some very poor writing holding back her performance that could be so much more than what we see if the director had capitalized on the opening scene more and kept her moving throughout the movie.  The role of Snow White played by Kristen Stewart, is well developed and the visual effects that surrounds her journey are at times breathtaking to say the least, the only thing lacking here is a strong actress to play the role as in one scene riding on the beach she looks more like a wet puppy then the leader of a nation about to go to battle as she slogs through the surf.<br /><br />All in all a great story, great visual effects, but some weak performances and really slow points hold this movie back from being on to keep your attention or you on the edge of your seat.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I liked this season mainly because the fmaily was back together. I, personally, hated Season Six mainly because the chemistry was missinf fir me. I didn't like Seaver at all. She was sort of a bargain basement JJ for me. But Season Seven proved that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
B008MC175A|4.0|Note: I have two Blue-ray/ DVD players. One is \\"Region A or 1\\" (the norm in the US) and the other is \\"Region Free\\" so that I can play anything I want in it (including Region A's or 1's).  My Panasonic \\"Region Free\\" is only about a year old.<br /><br />These Blue-ray disks has great a picture & sound.  How good the movie is I leave up to each person.  However, I do have a WARNING for everyone.<br /><br />I just discovered that some of the \\"Region A or 1\\" Blue-ray disks that I bought on \\"Amazon\\" will not play in my \\"Region Free\\" player.  But they play just fine in \\"Region A or 1\\" player.<br /><br />Most of the disks that will not play in my \\"Region Free\\" player will display a \\"Fox\\" back ground with a message that reads [This disc has been coded for Region A only and will not play in this machine. Please eject this disc and play on a Region A player.] on the screen after you insert the disk.  The others that will not play in \\"Region Free\\" player have different backgrounds with a similar massage.<br /><br />*****Four of these five Blue-ray disks happen to have this problem!<br />  Only \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine would play in both players.<br /><br />Since I have one of each this is not a problem for me, but I thought it would be useful to know for those who might only have a \\"Region Free\\" player.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this game rocks balls. it a total copy of grand theft auto. but it does have a good story line and I have enjoyed playing it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|What a rollercoaster ride this book was. I have to admit there were parts in this story where I'd just had enough of Eva and Gideon and their constant self-doubt. I was so frustrated with their on again off again relationship and the fighting and making up. I asked myself countless times, is this relationship worth saving? Maybe sometimes love isn't enough and it's time to just throw in the towel. But then Gideon would do or say something so contrary to his actions that I'd love him again. I just had no idea what was going on in that man's head. In this case, I love the use of the first person narrative. It was perfect for this story and kept me in constant suspense.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva's relationship is just dysfunctional. There is no other way to describe it. Yet, I can feel how much they love each other. I thought perhaps Gideon couldn't say he loved Eva because he just didn't feel it, but when he finally does share his feelings you realize he feels so much more than love.<br /><br />\\"People get over love. They can live without it, they can move on. Love can be lost and found again. But that won't happen for me. I won't survive you, Eva.\\" My breath caught at the look on his face when he glanced at me. \\"I'm obsessed with you, angel. Addicted to you. You're everything I've ever wanted or needed, everything I've ever dreamed of. You're everything. I live and breathe you. For you.\\"<br /><br />I have to admit, Eva bugged me at least half the book. She was so insecure I wanted to smack her. But Gideon's behavior didn't help her insecurities. The pair of them were heartbreaking at times. They loved each other but just didn't know how to communicate properly and keep from hurting each other.  Just when I was about to come to the point when I couldn't take anymore, Sylvia Day finally explains what prompted Gideon's strange behavior. Arrrggg. And then she left me hanging. So now I'm frustrated for a totally different reason. I love Gideon again, but now I have to wait for book 3 to find out what happens. All I have to say to readers is, be patient. All will be explained--eventually.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|love the game. I would recommend this to people who are looking for something to do when they are bored.
0307592731|5.0|I read a lot of accounts of true adventures, like thru-hikes, sailing around the world, cycling Asia, etc., and this is one of the very best, IMHO. Extremely well-written. Strayed combines brutal honesty with nature writing, and with realistic tales of life on the trail, and descriptions of her motivation, inner states, struggles, to bring it all together into something much better than a novel. It's an adventure, and the reader goes along. I loved it and just plain enjoyed reading it. If you like this kind of account, you'd also love Cactus Eaters, another description of a Pacific Crest Trail thru-hike with lots of personal detail, and so well-written.

B0017YDPI2|3.0|I buy quite a few movies through amazon, however, I was very dissatisfied when I opened up my package of movies and saw the binding on all the movies were in perfect condition, except for Supernatural Season 3. I wouldn't normally complain, but Supernatural has and will always be my favorite TV show and seeing that made me quite upset. They have given me the assumption that they don't particularly care for each and every one of their customers, considering they get many people from all over the world and they always come back for more. I thought about returning it, but decided not to, b/c I'm not going to pay shipping again and again just to get the same condition.

B008IGP8RI|4.0|Nick Cave and Warren Ellis are a force of musical brilliance that rendered me a pile of shaken tears from their scores to The Proposition, The Road and The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford. They are simply the two most brilliant composers to have ever graced the medium of cinema. Nick Cave has a very rare distinction of being not only a bandleader with Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, but he is also a screenwriter and a composer. He wrote the screenplay to The Proposition as well as for Lawless. John Hillcoat directed his band's music videos so naturally when Hillcoat made the leap to features he brought along Nick Cave and Warren Ellis (also part of The Bad Seeds). Now, Lawless is a unique musical experience. The film is made up equally of songs and score. The songs though are such an integral part of the story that they act as score. Cave and Ellis pretty much wrote, performed or produced every song on the soundtrack as well so this isn't a normal song album of source music. The songs are the score.<br /><br />Lawless is a fantastic film, and I really mean that. The characters carry the film, but since it takes place during prohibition the music needed to focus on the time period and location. Hillcoat loves westerns and he infuses this film with many western archetypes even though it takes place in Virginia. The film is definitely labeled as a gangster film, but honestly I think gangster and western genres share almost all the same archetypes. You'll notice that Cave and Ellis do different incarnations of the same songs very much like they did in The Proposition. The music's tone changes as you progress, and even though it's hard to get a handle of the film through this CD you can tell that the songs do set a certain mood. The only bit of score on the CD is \\"End Crawl\\" and it's a decent piece of score even though it's only a tiny piece of the big picture. The score in the film working with the songs is the real experience, and unfortunately we are missing that score on the CD. The full experience is top notch. The film is extremely heavy at times and the score does a superb job of carrying the narrative.<br /><br />This is a fantastic album filled with Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' approach for the film from the song perspective. Their score side is equally impressive and should be experienced so make it a goal to see this movie. Lawless doesn't come close to the brilliance of their other scores, but I consider their other scores to be masterpieces. This is score capturing the essence of a time and a place. The songs set up the necessary moods and work extremely well in the film and make for a great album as well.missing that score on the CD. The full experience is top notch.

B0031RS64G|2.0|I don't like this book. I want to like it, I am trying to like it, and having paid good money for it I don't want to give up on it easily. But so far I am failing badly. I should like it - an intelligent book filled with beautiful prose and original ideas rather than tired clich&eacute;. However, it is just such hard work. There are too many characters and too little character building, so that I find I can hardly remember from one reading session to the next who they are or what they have been doing. The plot seems to jump around with so little flow that it is hard to feel involved or to care about the story. In many ways it is similar to Martin's Ice & Fire books - an original fantasy world of huge scope, of light and shade rather than black and white, many characters and numerous plot threads, and mature writing. However, though Martin's story managed to hook me from the first chapter, Erikson has so far left me cold. I'll persevere, but...
0553382179|4.0|I would love for her routines to work for me.  But I just don't see how I can get through all this work and still have time to do things that I actually like to do.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|A complete surprise. A hero worth rooting for that isn't plagued by a superiority complex. Great plot twists and hooks. The only dissappointment was discovering book 1 was relatively new and I would have to wait an extended period until the next. Spoiler alert** When the novices square off against the guards with their newly aquired skills I felt like a kid again- YEAH KICK THEIR A***! LOL- LIke I said- I was impressed.
B001UU6XPA|4.0|There is a reason year one is a big deal.  It was the starting point for all modern age Graphic Novels for Batman.  Many of them have become cannon and the author has become one of the most celebrated authors in all of comics!  (with the exception of all star batman and robin of course LOL)  Year one was one of the first batman novels to show you what Gotham looks like from the perspective of your average working-class blue Collar Joe.  This Joe's name is Gordon and he is the new honest guy cop whose mouth got him in trouble in the last town he worked in.  That is how he ends up here in this dump called Gotham.<br /><br />He wants to do some good in a corrupt town.  Of course he knows it's not gonna be easy and it's gonna be hard to find people he can trust.  Bruce Wayne is a guy with  money, killer skills, and a serious grudge who wants to change the town where in a way that the corrupt politics can't interfere with, and you meet a DA named Dent who stubbornly tries to make the system work correctly.  The three of them meet to form an uneasy alliance and they try to find ways to use their different skills and connections to make the city a better place.  It's not always easy but it works minus some minor hiccups along the way.  The only reason I don't love it, is because the side stories sometimes distract TOO MUCH from the main story so I don't feel like I get to see enough of Year One Batman in Action.  Also, I don't like the fact that Batman is already 25, 21-23 would've been a better age because there is A LOT of Bat Stuff in continuity and it doesn't always make sense that it somehow manages to fit in there.<br /><br />And Lastly of course, it's all about the gangsters.  And for the first year, why would it be anybody else?  I just don't care much for the gangsters in batman who aren't Maroni, Falcone, or Black mask.  I prefer the Super-villains who do not come along until much later!!  That is just personal preference though.  You should not dare call yourself a true Batman Fan if you don't read this graphic novel.f a true Batman Fan if you don't read this graphic novel.

B005LAIGPU|4.0|This movie was fairly good and shows how troubled teens don't need super powers. But I'm not a fan of the camcorder filming of a movie. The plot isn't great but okay, acting was okay, a little dark. Could have been a good movie if not used so much of the camcorder film aspect. I rate it 3.5 stars.

0307237699|1.0|Here is God's truth that He alone is saviour:<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the multi-faith movement where all religions/gods/goddesses are treated the same.  This book seems to romanticize multi-faith and diversity.  Look to the One True God who made Heavens and earth and only Him if you value your life.  Obey His law.<br /><br />Daniel 7:19-26 JPS  Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell; even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose appearance was greater than that of its fellows.<br /><br />I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the kingdom.<br /><br />Thus he said: 'The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.  (Global world and along with it, the multi-faith movement that professes all faiths should be treated with equal respect such as Tony Blair of the UK is a proponent of.  They use such words as \\"diversity\\", \\"religious tolerance\\" and \\"unity\\" and \\"interfaith dialogue\\".  Notice how Book of Daniel actually uses the word \\"diverse\\")<br /><br />And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings. And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a timeand times and half a time.<br /><br />But the judgment shall sit, and his dominions shall be taken away, to be consumed and to be destroy unto the end.<br /><br />Isaiah 43:10-15  Ye are My witnesses, saith the LORD, and My servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He; before Me there was no God formed, neither shall any be after Me.  I, even I, am the LORD; and {{beside Me there is no saviour.}} !!!!!!<br /><br />I have declared, and I have saved, and I have announced, and there was no strange god among you; therefore ye are My witnesses, saith the LORD, and I am God.  Yea, since the day was I am He, and there is none that can deliver out of My hand; I will work, and who can reverse it?<br />Thus saith the LORD, your Redeemer, The Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their shouting.  I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.<br /><br />Isaiah 45:5-7 I am the LORD, and there is none else, beside Me there is no God; I have girded thee, though thou hast not known Me; That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside Me; I am the LORD; and there is none else; I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I am the LORD, that doeth all these things.
B005LAII3U|4.0|So, so movie, it was good as good as the first original version with Arnold. But that movie stinks when you watch it now years later. This one was a little more then the first but still not that great of a story line, the story line of the original was better, but the effects and acting in this remake was better. At least that's my two cents.
B004N7WJF0|5.0|I bought this DVD for the first time quite some years ago - actually in Singapore when it was playing in a music store. I had not really heard or seen anything of Scorpions before but the music was too fantastic to ignore. Over the years I have continued to thoroughly enjoy a superbly crafted concert, albeit in a somewhat contrived physical environment, and while I have no pretensions as to being able to assess the quality from a solely musical perspective, the whole thing was a joy to hear. Remarkable to be reminded that so many well-known pieces were delivered by this band. The recent purchase was for a friend in the US, who was also bowled over by the superb quality and tight performances. Highly recommended whatever type of music floats your boat.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app makes pinterest so much easier than just using the mobile version. it is awesome:) the app itself works so well you don't really even notice its not on the computer.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is one of the greatest concerts ever! I've watched it many times, and each time is just as great as the first. The venue, the bands, Eric Clapton, Olivia and Dahni Harrison outdid themselves. Fantastic!!
B005LAIGSC|5.0|Good suspense and drama, as well as plot. Great actors, I like Ryan R. and his other works. This has allot of action and he does well. Denzel is good as well also. Good twist and plot, as well as story line. Will probably purchase for my father (and me).
B0038AUY96|5.0|Again Jo Nesbo keeps you guessing until the end, compulsive reading, taking the reader from frigid Oslo to flooding Bergen; from the sordid world of the drug dealer and the desperate life of the drug user; to the sleazy world of the prostitute and the lascivious and secret life of her client.

B0024SQW2Q|5.0|Good Vampire vs. Lycon flick, I enjoyed them all pretty much. Story is okay action is great and drama and suspense is in there a bit as well. No name actors did well also at least none of them I really recognize from anything else.
B008M34INW|5.0|This was one of the better Mel Gibson movies that he has made and definitely the best that he has made lately.  Mel is going back to his roots in this one in playing the smart, quirky, funny bad/good guy.
034580404X|5.0|These books were AMAZING!  The entire series was jaw-dropping and entertaining.  I couldn't put them down!  Yes, it is risque, but it's not horrible and it definitely goes with the story-line.<br />The only negative thing I can say about the entire series is that the third book seems a little bit rushed.  Like maybe the author was in a hurry to get it done, or was just anxious to get to how she wanted to end it.  Overall though, great books.  I have no idea what to read next!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I was exited when I got this app but after a while I noticed that it wasn't saving my worlds what do you press to save it?
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|This is not your childs Disney movie for sure. But a more adult version of the classic snow white tail with a evil witch queen. Much more action then expected and good action at that. Special effects were good and not to over powering. All in all a good movie, not 5 stars but a solid 4 stars. Again its an adult version of a kids classic so one can't expect to much or can you?
B006OOHYIC|2.0|Great game, but the last update wiped my whole progress. Now I have to start over. Did you even test the update? Can't give more than 2 stars for such a novice mistake.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Another Harry Potter movie, and a great one it is!  Gotta love how they kept the same cast and the same quality of acting all through the series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun, simple, addictive game just like the fair! Only downfall would be it taking awhile to accumulate coins. Great to pass the time.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Great Thor movie, good action, good story line, good drama, and characters were good as well. With plenty of action, and fights.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It passes time.  App works well, pics are great.  Use it to unwind.  Not much of a gamer.  Like word puzzles more.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|No movie is better than the book, but this was still great.  The acting was superb!  And the casting was very well-done!  Great movie with a wonderful message and story-line.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|We wanted to watch a movie that would make us laugh and this delivered.  I wasn't sure if it would be just a dumb flick based on the concept and the previews that I saw but I have to say it really was funny.  I really enjoyed it.  It's a good comedy.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|I think they went in the wrong direction with this one. It wasn't nearly as good as the other movies. It was okay with some action, but also some clumsy story lines and plots. Things any idiot could see coming a mile away the great Zeus couldn't see? A rental that's about it not worth buying for me anyway.
1402210086|4.0|It's little wonder that Heyer is considered the best author of Regency romances. This book was a pleasure to read mainly because of by the underlying humor characterizing most conversations as well as the character portrayal of the the hero and heroine (the former a simple but practical man and the latter a vivacious  well meaning person)<br /><br />While for a romance novel it is indeed low on the blushes and passion, I loved how the H and H's relationship evolves and they come to realize their love for each other- it stems from deep rooted affection<br /><br />Many of the historical authors today definitely would do well to take a lesson in language from the author. Most of them get some elements of the setting correct - i often see a  mention the ratafia and punch - but the characters speak in almost modern day america
0439023491|5.0|After reading Hunger Games I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book!  I believe I read the whole thing in a day and a half!  It was entertaining and filled with so much action!  I loved it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great follow up! I can't wait to find out what is next. Ace and Angel are really working things out. I am sure there is more drama ahead for the two of them though.
B008QE9VJI|4.0|Great movie, dark but not to dark and full of comedy.  Johnny Depp plays the character well just like Capt. Jack Sparrow. It's a dark comedy type movie, not a horror flick, so if you're looking for a horror flick keep looking. If you want something kind of like a funny horror film but not kiddie funny then this is a hit. It is quirky in the right way and fun all around to watch. I will probably purchase it soon or ask for it for Christmas from my wife :-)
B00571F26Y|5.0|After reading \\"In the Defense of Food\\" I was fairly sure of eating better. However,the facts about wheat are really amazing. In the past week without wheat my wife and I are in fact noticing differences in our mental and physical health. It very well could be a placebo effect but probably not. There is no astounding differences just sensing differences where the need to eat \\"a little more\\" bread is gone. We did fall into the trap of buying some rice flour crackers and then upon reading about their raising blood sugar. We won't do that again.<br />A book like this should be required reading for all fat school kids and their parents!!!
0439023513|5.0|Great ending to an awesome trilogy.  So well-written, with all the characters and parts of the plot being described in such detail.  It's easy to get lost in these books!

B005LAIIQC|4.0|It wasn't the first 3 and was supposed to be taking place during the 3rd one in different parts of the world. References to Jason Bourne and what was going on popped up now and again. Over all a nice action flick, plenty of good action and fights. Was it better then the first 3 no not really, was it worse.. Hmmm... Not really, it was just below the first 3 but not a total bomb. I liked it okay and would probably ask for it as a gift for birthday or christmas.

Sound quality is excellent, very comfortable the controls are easy to use and the battery life is very good.  I can walk around my house without any loss of sound no pops or cracks like my Xbox wireless headphones.  What I like most is you can hear every little detail when gaming even down to the movement around you giving you the edge over those that don't use headphones.  Recommend if your going to make the move for the money they are well worth it.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. It started out like many novels, a story about a writer(s). What do writers understand best? They focus on stories about struggling writers. However, the plot took a surprising turn, many a time, and I was completely hooked. Lots of fun, enjoy.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|If this series (7 TV seasons: 1999-2006) had been written this year it could not be more relevant to our current political reality, both domestic and international. This may say as much about the nature of our adversarial political structure and shrinking world interdependence as it does about the unbelievable insight of Aaron Sorkin and the West Wing writers. Even though it is billed as fictional, actual incidents are clearly borrowed from the front page and re-purposed here for their dramatic qualities. And although the story revolves around a Democratic administration, all points of view are presented in the most cogent and compelling way.<br /><br />The actors are brilliant. I cannot get enough of Bradley Whitford, Allison Janney or Richard Schiff, and I was really sorry to see Rob Lowe leave the show. The characters are clearly defined, each with a unique set of foibles, flaws, philosophies and loyalties. They triumph and fail... just like real human beings. Something should be said here about the casting of the show: perfect.<br /><br />I am constantly intrigued and often uplifted by the stories, even the ones that make me mad, e.g., two instances of the President ordering acts of war after little or no effort to seek a peaceful resolution. The conflicts are deep, like real life. The writers expertly weave and insert, complicate and resolve twists and turns you never see coming. The characters talk fast which makes the show demanding to watch. You can't have it on in the background while you do other things. But the investment of time and thought was, at least for me, very worthwhile... dare I say educational. The wry wit of the dialogue is lots of fun and the subtle humor in the interplay of characters in compromising situations makes me LOL regularly. Over the well-developed serial stories, the set ups for jokes really pay off.<br /><br />I used to make my own copies of the West Wing on VHS tape. But my life took over and I stopped watching the show; I missed about 3 years. Then like everybody else, I stopped using my VCR and ended up throwing all those tapes away. So now being able to see the entire show on DVD from beginning to end is like an old friend coming back to me. Amazingly, the show is refreshing and new... even though I still recall some of the most memorable scenes from the first viewing years ago. I will watch it all again, too, as there is so much here, it easily bears re-watching... which is why I bought the collection.<br /><br />I cannot recommend the complete WEST WING highly enough.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|I ordered this movie before the release date. The movie is great. One of the best I have seen in a long time. Follows the book closely but as happens a lot with books that are made into movies, the book is better. You get more information than they can fit in a movie. The shipping did take longer than I expected but since I got it a lot cheaper than in the store I was ok on waiting.

B005LAIHZE|3.0|This movie was not that great at all. The best parts are probably in the trailers, and teasers. It was okay for old time vampire vs. human action. But some of the weapons like his Axe was way over technical for the age, as was his sudden ability to take out a 20\\" diameter tree with one swing. Also the story line was a bit much, with a bad history lesson. I will not purchase it or recommend to friends and family other then a redbox $1.00 rental when you have seen everything else good to see.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I'm not gonna say much since so many others have already. Simply put, this is a great film. As a Batman fan, I am very satisfied with this adaption. It follows the book very closely, taking out what might not work on film. All the intensity and excitement of the original story seems to remain intact, and Batman has a great presence throughout. I truly felt for the character and his mission while watching, and I'm looking forward to viewing it again.
B007L6VR6M|4.0|The 411 by Maria:<br /><br />The movie starts off feeling very odd to me, I mean Ed Norton, Bruce Willis, Bill Murphy, Francis McDormand, and Harvey Keitel (to name a few) big name folks in a movie that seems very dated, slow and \\"stage\\" like.  Ed Norton in a \\"cub scout leader\\" like uniform through the whole movie was just odd.  BUT...once you get past that you see it is a yesteryear look into the 60's done in a beautifully nostalgic way when life was simpler.  BUT...beside all of that, it is a beautifully done, well act movie by all players.<br /><br />The story focuses on two tweens, one odd and an orphan and the other from a well to do home. Their love story is very sweet, and the actors both in their first film are incredibly talented.  The girl, Suzy played by Kara Hayward reminded me of a young Abagail Breslin and the actor Sam, played by Jared Gilman was adorably odd and dorky with his slightly askew glasses and crooked smile.<br /><br />The scenes are set up beautifully and while the movie is slow, quiet and sweet, the love story of these two children affect all around them mostly for the better.<br /><br />I love the scenes of the two off on their own, making camp, fishing, taking inventory of their belongs and taking care of each other. Very sweet.<br /><br />There are a few scenes that I was uncomfortable with as the two youths (I sound like Joe Pesci), were 12ish during the filming and spend a bit of time in their underwear. I mostly imagine 70 or so people on the set while these two walk and dance around in their skivvies and how wrong that is. Their kissing scenes are adorable too and not overly sexualized but I always wonder what sick fantasy the writer or director are living out.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good movie with a great cast!

Being a horn player for many years, I was pleasantly surprised to hear a plethora of horns used throughout the album.  Actually featured might be a better description.  The horns are not only featured but used in unique, creative arrangements.  The players must have been thrilled to participate in such a wonderful project.  Easily a contender for my favorite album on 2012 now.  I love it when I try and album and get a wonderful surprise!

Alien race comes to earth after we send a signal to them not knowing we are not at advanced as they are.

0440237688|5.0|\\"It's the choosing that's important, isn't it?\\"<br /><br />Jonas lives in a world of \\"Sameness\\" with his Mother, his Father, and his younger sister, Lily. It's a world governed by rules, by rigid structure, by conformity. Jonas enjoys his life--until he is selected to be The Receiver. His job? To receive the memories from The Giver of the past. And what the past unveils shows a drastically different world than Jonas lives in.<br /><br />This week is Banned Books Week, and in honor, I selected this from the ALA Banned Book List. Some of the reasons included euthanasia, sexual awakening, and infantcide.<br /><br />Another reason I chose this book is I love dystopias, and with the modern crop of iffy dystopias for Young Adults, I thought I would return to the roots, to see one of the first (if not the first) Young Adult Dystopia novels.<br /><br />In short, this book is brilliant. The dystopia works, the characters are great, the writing is excellent, and I was genuinely moved.<br /><br />A lot of recent dystopias seem to have their world-building constructed like a house of cards: one little sneeze, and the entire thing falls in your lap. With the exception of the giving and receiving of memories (Is Jonas genetically modified to be able to give and receive? Is this science? Magic? How does this happen?), the world building is consistent, realistic, and understandable. People have been stripped of choices; they live in a sanitized \\"safe\\" world where no conflict exists. Families are created based on strict algorithms; people are assigned their jobs, their spouses, their children. The only books are those based on the rules of the society. People must be precise in their language; you don't just toss around the word \\"love\\" anymore.<br /><br />What I thought was most amazing was how polite everyone was. To eradicate conflict, everyone was trained to immediately apologize for sins and to accept apologies. Debate, discord, arguments--all of these never occurred because there was no outlet. I felt sad about this, particularly because my hobby is reviewing, and if there is one thing I've learned while reviewing, it's that everyone has a different opinion about everything. But in this society, such things as a difference of opinion would never have been cultivated or encouraged; we would never have debate; we would never argue and learn to be social. Instead, we would be silenced.<br /><br />The characters were great. I really got close to Jonas, and there were at least twice when I was nearly moved to tears after something happened to him. I was astonished at how quickly and easily I great attached to him; it's truly a gifted author who can write her protagonist so well that the reader is so close to him after so short a time. Other characters, such as The Giver, Mother, Father, Lily, Asher, Fiona, may not have been the highlight, but they were well-established. Asher's clumsiness with words, Lily's impetuousness, Father's nurturing (very interesting, as it is so often the woman is pigeon-holed into this role!), Mother's rationality--they hint at each being an individual, straining to be free in a Same society.<br /><br />The writing is obviously for a younger reader, probably about middle grade. While I don't typically read middle grade books, I felt I was still able to enjoy it, that it wasn't too \\"dumbed down\\".<br /><br />As for why it is banned....poppycock! I think this is a perfect book for a middle-schooler/early high school student. While I might agree that a parent should be on standby for some scenes (just in case questions or discussion topics arise), I think this book is a great gateway into a better understanding of our world and the things we hold important. What better way to show a burgeoning young man or woman how valuable choice and love and the beauty of nature around us than to show a world that doesn't have any of that. What a better way to show kids to be engaged in everything around us, that life is precious, that emotions, good and bad, are important and healthy.<br /><br />\\"The Giver\\" may not be the first dystopian novel nor the last, but it's still an important work that can teach everyone something new. If things like loving your family, the horrors of killing someone because they aren't \\"useful\\", and the gift of choice and the beauty of nature are things we don't want in our society, then sure, this book should remain banned. Personally, I WANT to love, I WANT choice, I WANT to see beauty. I think the banning of this book is the highest form of irony; I know if I ever have kids, that I won't be banning it from them.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B0058YPL66|5.0|Wow!  This show is like a breath of fresh air.  This is just the kind of show that television networks really needed.  It's a serious antidote to all the sitcoms, crime dramas, and reality shows that seem to fill network television air times.<br /><br />This is fantasy story-telling, for modern times.  While the language used in the \\"fantasy world\\" scenes seem too modern for the usual fantasy genre, it fits perfectly here.  Again, this is a fairy tale for modern times.  This ain't a stage production of Shakespeare.  What it is, is a story being told to viewers of all ages and not some high-minded theatre.  And it does not pretend to be.  The production quality is very high, and the special effects from the Season 1 Finale are just as good as what you would find anywhere in television.  And that includes HBO.  I would go out on a limb and say that the production and special effects on this show rival, if not exceed, those from the highly-regarded Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Lana Parrilla (Regina/Evil Queen) is probably one of the more interesting villains on television today.  Her character is well-developed, capable of both good and evil.  Admittedly, she usually chooses the latter approach in most of her dealings.  Her motivations for her hatred of Snow White (Mary Margaret in modern times) is something that the audience can relate to.  Well, some of the audience.  This is a story that crosses both time and space.  The games being played between Regina, Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold, and Snow White take place simultaneously across time.  Love and hatred, revenge and vengeance, know no bounds it would seem.<br /><br />And what a terrific job Jared Gilmore had done, playing Henry.  I cannot remember a scene in which he has acted badly.  Here we are, 23 episodes done and he just continues to shine.  The rest of the cast are no less spectacular.  This is a show filled with good acting.  In my opinion, Robert Carlyle and Lana Parrilla deserve all the credit and all the recognition that they've been getting.<br /><br />So what is the show about?  What can I write that would not spoil the plot for you?  Ok, here are the basics.  Young Snow White makes a big mistake, which resulted in a very painful loss for Regina.  Regina turns to dark magic and vows revenge on Snow White.  Meanwhile, a humble Rumplestiltskin (played by Robert Carlisle) decides to take the power of the Dark One for himself in order to no longer be the coward that he is known for.  Snow White grows into a young woman, all the while running and hiding from Regina, who has become Queen.  Meanwhile, she meets up with James, known as Prince Charming.  Every move that Regina makes to take her revenge on Snow White has failed.  Somehow, Snow and her friends always managed to beat back Regina's attacks.  But, not to be outdone (hate is a powerful motivator after all), Regina makes one very bold move.  One that would affect the entire realm.  She puts together a curse that transported everyone in the realm, into a world without magic.  Yes, our world.  And without their memories intact!  That is the curse, to live in a miserable world, never remembering who they once were.  But all curses can be broken.  A master carpenter named Gepetto creates a box, from the wood of an enchanted tree.  And in that box, the daughter of Prince Charming and Snow White was placed, in order to protect her from the curse.  She gets sent to the future along with the others, but because of the protection afforded by the magic chest, she has abilities that protect her from Regina, who is now the town mayor.  The daughter, Emma (played by Jennifer Morrison), ends up in Boston.  Young Emma grows up bouncing from one foster home to another.  She gets pregnant at 17 and makes a decision to give up her baby (Henry), to give him the best chance in life.<br /><br />Just like the very best and most engrossing of all stories, this one is equally driven by plot and by character.  Perhaps one of the more touchingcharacter plots here is that of Pinocchio and his father Gepetto.  Great acting from Eion Bailey and from Tony Amendola.<br /><br />In my view, this is the best show on network television right now.  Perhaps equal to Game of Thrones. The latter ofcourse is for mature audiences only.  Once Upon A Time is a show that everyone can enjoy.  There's something there for everyone.  With so many characters, and so many plot lines, you are sure to find one that will keep you tuned in week after week.  And, if you missed Season 1 and are slow to catch on, this DVD set is just the ticket.character plots here is that of Pinocchio and his father Gepetto.

B0088749CW|5.0|Outstanding movie. Asks a lot of questions. Please watch it with an open mind. It is NOT a horror movie, is more like a social thriller. Don't listen to the naysayers on this website, they most likely didn't understand or don't agree with the final question the movie asks at the very end as the titles role..<br /><br />The action takes place in a small mining town in Washington state in the middle of the woods. The plot is poorly described on the cover of the blu ray. I will do my best to describe it without spoiling the story for you.<br /><br />Jessica Biel is a nurse (Julia Denning) who lives in this small town. She was married to the town's doctor who died and now tries to take care of everybody in this small town. This was a booming town with everybody working at the mine. Everybody was prosperous and happy. The mine is closed now for some time and the town is loaded with jobless poor people and a lot of young kids running around aimlessly while their parents drink, smoke, fight, and make more kids (...wonder where all the money comes from, for cigarettes, food and alcohol). The kids grow old and then they get married and make more kids on their own, while sitting in a bar drinking, complaining about how hard life is, and smoking all day long. After the mine closed and the town started deteriorating, young kids started disappearing. Everybody talks about a tall man who is most likely responsible for the abduction of the children. While everybody is uptight about the tall man, the kids are still out playing while their parents seat around in the town's small restaurant drinking, eating, and doing nothing. The movie starts when already 17 young kids are missing and Jessica Biel's son (David) is abducted too. She is chasing down the person who stole her son, and ....<br /><br />I am going to leave it here because I don't want to give you the really interesting plot and the unexpected ending of the movie. Unlike other movies that let you guess at the end or create your own ending (...sic!), there is a full explanation at the very end of the movie (last 2-3 minutes) and a question that begs for a discussion and an answer. It is difficult to give a straight answer. The director wants to make sure that we know exactly where he is going with the movie. After watching the movie please come back here if you want, and let's have a philosophical discussion about the story and its purpose. Do we need to break the cycle?<br /><br />Jessica Biel is outstanding and the supporting cast provides a great performance.

B008QE9XD2|3.0|This is a Tim Burton movie!  That should have already told me that this is not going to be anything like the original Dark Shadow.  Sometimes, I got the impression that Tim Burton could not make up his mind.  Is this a comedy or a horror show?<br /><br />All this tragedy, all this suffering, came about because a young Barnabas spurned the love of the family maid, Angelique.  Unfortunately for Barnabas, Angelique is unlike most women.  Most women who get spurned simply just suck it up, get depressed, and write poems about it.  But not Angelique.  Angelique knows witchcraft!  She puts together a curse to strike at Barnabas, turning him into a vampire.  Unable to control his urge to suck the life blood from humans, Barnabas eventually gets imprisoned and buried away.  The people of Collinsport eventually got tired of his dining habits, marches up to Collinwood and takes Barnabas into custody.  Driven by Angelique, they imprison Barnabas into a special coffin and buried him deep under ground.  Time marched on and eventually these events were forgotten.<br /><br />Now, fast forward two hundred years into the future, to the year 1972.  Construction workers accidentally release Barnabas from his coffin.  Still alive, the vampire wakes up from his sleep of two centuries.  Immediately, he makes his way back to Collinwood, and finds the once-glorious mansion in a state of decay and disrepair.  The family fortune has turned for the worse, it would seem.  Barnabas introduces himself to the now dysfunctional Collins family and learns that the once thriving Collins caning plant has been struggling to stay in business. To complicate matters, Barnabas must now learn to adapt to the modern world.  Nevertheless, Barnabas makes a vow to his new family that he will bring the family business back to its former glory, and with it, the family finances. Angelique is still alive, naturally.  And now owns the biggest business in town.<br /><br />This is actually a pretty good movie.  I'm just not a big fan of Tim Burton's ideas.  I much prefer the Dark Shadows revival of the early 1990s.  Anyway, I do agree with the comedic and light-hearted treatment of the material.  With all of the vampire movies out there (Twilight, True Blood, Underworld, Blade), the last thing Hollywood needed was another stereotypical vampire flick.  So, perhaps this may not have been the right moment to bring out another vampire film.  And if you must do so, you have to be a little different.  And this one certainly is.  Vampires are a dime a dozen in cinema today.  Perhaps Dan Curtis' vision would have been met with lukewarm reception, given the number of vampire exposure on both the big screen and television.  Tim Burton probably felt like he needed to take his movie in another direction.  Given that there were other vampire-themed movies to come out in 2012, from the outlandish \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" to the latest in the \\"Twilight\\" franchise, it may have been the right thing to do.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is actually very good as Barnabas.  Eva Green and Michelle Pfeifer were pretty good in their respective roles.  In my view, Chloe Grace Moretz should have been given better material to work with.  She was wasted in this film.  Jack Earle Haley is fine as Willie, but I would have much preferred Steve Buscemi for the role.t not a big fan of Tim Burton's ideas.  I much prefer the Dark Shadows revival of the early 1990s.

B008QE9VJI|4.0|This is a great comedy with absolutely great music!<br /><br />Everybody knows the story. Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is turned into a vampire and locked in a coffin by Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) a witch who is in love with him. Barnabas is found 200 years later and released from his coffin. He returns to Collinsport (a town that his father build with his fortune), to take over the dying business of his family. Thankfully he is released in 1972 when the music is great. Imagine him released from the grave in the mid 90's with all the rap music we could have to endure throughout the movie. The film opens with \\"Night in White Satin\\" by the Moody Blues. You get your money's worth just on the music. The soundtrack of this movie is absolutely FABULOUS.<br /><br />The performances of Johnny Depp, Eva Green, and Michele Pfeiffer are absolutely stunning. Eva Green is particularly outstanding as always in her role of the mean witch. There is a lot of black humor in the movie and while the end is totally predictable I enjoyed getting there.<br /><br />If you want to spend two hours enjoying some great acting, great music, and some black, totally British humor (where Alice Cooper is considered to be the ...ugliest woman and the McDonald's sign is the sign of the devil), then this is a movie for you. However, this is not the kind of movie that is going to keep you on the edge of your seat guessing about the ending. The love story of Barnabas appears to be a secodary minor plot.<br /><br />Five stars because of the amazing cast, the acting and the music. The plot and the humor only get three stars. Overall four stars.

B008I34YYY|4.0|In the Rogues Gallery of B-movie history, one villain rises above all others: the Nazi.  There's some sort of psychological work at play: schlock entertainment revolving around one of the greatest human evils ever known.  It's the subject of theses and studies, and it provokes fear and fun in the viewers.<br /><br />But to hell with all that.  We're dealing with Nazis on the moon, for God's sake.  Here's the deal: in 1945, the Nazis set up a base camp on the dark side of the moon.  Now, in the year 2018, an American astronaut/model (Christopher Kirby) stumbles upon their superstructure.  A rising star in the Nazi party (Gotz Otto) plans to use the American in his scheme to unseat the current Fuhrer (Udo Kier) and overtake planet Earth; only thing is, his cutie Earthologist girlfriend (Julia Dietze) has taken a shine to the newcomer.  Shall the Nazis prevail in their campaign against a war-hungry American government (run by a Palin stand-in)?  Or shall the world pull itself together and kick some moon Nazi butt?<br /><br />Well, you can guess which it is.  There aren't a lot of surprises in IRON SKY.  Nor are there supposed to be.  It's a campy good time, with some truly disturbing themes, some hilarious moments, quite a bit of eye-rolling political insight, and just all around fun.  If you take movies seriously, steer clear.  If you're looking for a good horror film, go elsewhere.  This is shlock entertainment at its modern-day finest.  Do you think you can give this film a shot?  Yes you can!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I just finished \\"No Easy Day\\".  I thought it was a very good book, especially the chapters dedicated to the raid of the compound.  It was an easy read and at times I couldn't turn the page fast enough. It was interesting to see how the SEALS train. I thought it was well written.
B003QNXPUK|5.0|This is the second set I put on. The first time I put both front and back on, and it was \\"sticky\\" comming out of holster, plus I dropped it a couple times causing it to curl up at corners. This time I did the front screen, only, and took my time to get bubbles out, saving the back side as a replacement for the front in future, with some minor alterations. I've got this product on both phone, and IPAD. It really protects the screen from scratches. Minor bubbles after intallation evaporate after a couple days. I also tried some cheap versions, but they are very stiff, and don't adhere, like this one.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Folks,<br />  Hollywood remakes foreign movies for our convenience of eliminating the subtitle hassle, and out of arrogance. Eh, don't let them touch this one.  THEY WILL RUIN IT TO ALL GLORY!!! It is just fine. I did the hard work of: stop, rewind, play, pause, etc. And, it was worth it!! I literally found myself trying to talk to the main character (the seedy guy making his buck) to hold it together and not get killed! This movie was smart, unpredictable at times, and just simplistically beautiful. I had lucked out through my search with this one. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THIS FILM!!! NO USUAL MOVIE CLICHES in this one!!! You will not do the 'yeah, yeah, yeah...'<br /><br />  Hollywood is slipping... There are foreign films out there like this one that are so much more memorable.<br /><br />  Americans, get off the straight a way highway were you zone out. Be a little more active, exert a little more  mental energy, and WATCH MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE!!! It will be worth your night!!!
1423140605|3.0|I was excited to get this book, but halfway through it froze the app up on my kindle.  It froze up the same place when I opened the app on my phone.  I called and they were pretty unhelpful, though they did call the next day to say I had a valid complaint?  I was able to skip and scan past the bad spot and continue reading (skipped probably 10 pages).<br />The book itself was ok.  A little jumpy, probably from having too many main characters.  The end was sad, but good and well written.
B009GLHF5C|4.0|Muse is my favorite band, and one of the things that entranced me about them to begin with is how different each of their songs can sound from one another.  They tend to blur the lines between rock, pop, classical, etc., while bringing out the inner \\"awesome\\" of each genre they touch, and that is what I love.  So unlike some others, I do not really mind that they \\"change sounds\\" all of the time, because for me it is this variety that sets them apart.  With all that being said, the tracks on The 2nd Law just don't seem as \\"strong\\" to me as some of their other songs.  It is not merely the lack of a rockin' piano piece, or the scarcity of really heavy guitar songs, or even the prevalent 80's music vibe throughout many of the tracks (although I really like 80's music).  It is hard for me to put my finger on exactly what is lacking, but all I know is that on my first playthrough of this album I did not have that immediate sense of \\"This is awesome!\\" with each song that played.  Many of the songs came off as \\"interesting\\" or \\"cool\\" or \\"different,\\" but very few came off as instantly amazing.  This album maybe exudes a more \\"subtle\\" kind of awesomeness, because after a few listen throughs I have gained a greater appreciation for each track.  The album is very good, but in a more subdued way.<br /><br />1) Supremacy - Really solid rock-out song.  One of the strongest tracks on the album.<br /><br />2) Madness - One of the songs we were well familiar with before the album's release.  Good, punchy, mellow 80's sounding track that crescendos to greater, more triumphant awesomeness near the end.<br /><br />3) Panic Station - This song seemed very humorous and weird to me at first, especially with Matt's cheesy background vocals accompanying him.  However it is very catchy.  This is one that has grown on me and now I love singing along with it.  Its goofiness has become part of its charm.<br /><br />4) Prelude - It's all in the title, simply an instrumental lead-up to Survival.<br /><br />5) Survival - This song is still a mixed bag for me.  It's very cheesy, and still not quite in the good way that Panic Station is.  Great guitar parts, but the vocals are just weird.  In some moods I really enjoy it, but I also skip it a lot, too.<br /><br />6) Follow Me - I love this track.  I wouldn't call it love at first listen, but certainly by the second or third.  Sort of starts out sounding like \\"I Will Survive,\\" but that's okay, it gets so much better.  A very high energy song.  I hope they will release a more \\"rock\\" version of it, because what I saw of their live performance of this blew me away!<br /><br />7) Animals - A more mellow guitar piece.  Similar to some of their older stuff.  Low energy, but refined and solid.  The Wall Street sound byte at the end doesn't add much to it, or at least could have been a bit shorter.<br /><br />8) Explorers - I like this piece.  It has sort of a lullaby sound to it.  Good for soothing my frayed nerves, but not really made for rocking out.<br /><br />9) Big Freeze - I love this song.  I know that is a controversial statement.  My husband upon first listen funnily and aptly described it as the background music for some kind of 80's montage scene where they're building something.  So again it's a little heavy on the cheese, but not in an unappealing sort of way.  Still, even though I would call this \\"good\\" it doesn't hold a candle to some of Muse's better tracks.<br /><br />10) Save Me - The first song sung by Chris Wolstenholme, the bassist.  I was very surprised by his light and airy voice, I expected him to sound a lot heavier, like maybe Chris Cornell.  Anyway, this is a very good track, but runs a little bit long.  It's hard for me to make it to the end sometimes, but I can't outright skip it because it sucks me in every time.<br /><br />11) Liquid State - Chris' other song.  Very good, catchy, fast-paced rock tune.  This one could have benefited from a good solo, though, and whereas Save Me should havebeen shorter, this could have been a bit longer.<br /><br />12) The 2nd Law: Unsustainable - It's growing on me, but it just makes me think of the trailer it came with, and I wind up skipping it a lot.  The dubstep is okay, but does not amaze me.<br /><br />13) The 2nd Law: Isolated System - A groovy minimalist piece.  I wish it would have grown into something beyond the sound bytes that were incorporated into it.  Also seems like a weird closing track.  The three-part Exogenesis was much stronger and flowed much better than this so-labelled two parter.<br /><br />So like I said, when you look at each song individually most of them are quite good, but with some deficit as to prevent it all from being amazing.  I would still recommend The 2nd Law as a solid addition to any Muse fan's collection (obviously, since I gave it 4 stars), and even to Muse newbies since the newbies I've shared it with were far less critical than me and really enjoyed it.
B0000844M8|5.0|A British game warden in Kenya along with his wife adopt a baby lion named Elsa orphaned after her mother was shot. Elsa is cute and rambunctious, eventually wearing out her acceptance after stampeding a herd of elephants, causing damage to local houses and crops. Told to send her to a zoo, they instead commit to teaching her to become wild and live among her fellow lions. After a great deal of frustration and some scary moments involving Elsa fighting with other lions, they eventually succeed. Most incredible, Elsa returns to visit them from time to time, bringing her cubs with her.
B00973CGXK|2.0|I felt that this album was a disappointment compared to past albums by the Killers.  I had greater expectations.  Not much new or exciting about it.
B000002IAZ|5.0|This is an excellent CD. I listened to this music years ago and who doesn't love Neil Young and Stephen Stills?  A great band that made a big impact during the short time they were together as a group.
0439023513|1.0|I loved the first two books of the \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy, but was very disapppointed in the third book, \\"Mockingjay.\\" It's unrelievably dark and violent, with no bright spots anywhere. I won't give the plot away, just don't get too attached to very many characters, most of them won't be there by the end. A large group of children gets slaughtered horribly, people fall into the \\"meat grinder\\", people's skin gets torn off, people get addicted to \\"morphling\\", they get eaten by ghastly \\"mutts\\", and on and on. The writing slogs along as if the author ran out of her original good idea and just grimly powered on to the end. Even the decision by Katniss as to who she really loves is flat, with the reason given in just a couple of sentences. I realize the author is trying to make a point about war and violence, but she herself commits plenty of it here. I can't believe this is marketed to 13 year olds.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Might be.  Certainly in the top 10.  So many memories as I bought this when it came out on vinyl and played it on a one speaker system.
0375413405|5.0|It's not the easiest cook book. So, you should have some cooking experience before you start using it. But I love this book. Recipes are very interesting to cook, though I have to read it very carefully through before I start cooking.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I enjoyed this book almost as much as the first one but I got so frustrated with Gideon and his damn mood swings. I wanted to scream at Eva for having no dignity and to get her head together and start playing hard to get!. All in all, it is well written, hot and steamy and has a twist you probably won't see coming! I'm looking forward to the next one.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|There was little plot in this boring pedantic story. Wordy.  Went no where.  Not satisfying. I loved the first book. This one was very bad. I will not even borrow the third. What a waste.

0142420891|4.0|Where She Went was another book I couldn't put down and I think I liked it a little bit more than If I Stay.<br /><br />The story takes place three years after Mia's accident, it is told from Adam's perspective and I really liked that. We get to see how Adam's life has been in these past years, his journey but also some flashbacks of his past, when Mia was still a part of his life.<br /><br />Each chapter starts with lyrics of Shooting Star's songs, Adam's band, all of them being inspired by Mia. You can really see his pain and emotions in the lyrics and I think this added a nice touch to the book.<br /><br />Adam is very intense, angry and depressed in this book and I understand why, but I feel that his incapacity to get past the breakup is a little bit unrealistic, since the story takes place three years after Mia left.<br /><br />Mia's explanation wasn't my favourite and I still think she was selfish and she should have set him free, but I couldn't stay mad at her considering what she had been through.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this book was the ending. I mean, I know it was a happy ending and it offered a closure, but I think what happened in the last few pages was rushed and cheesy. They got back together after spending a few hours together. It was like all those 3 years never existed. I am one of the few persons who didn't want to see them becoming a couple again. I just wanted Adam to get the anticipated explanation from Mia, to sort his life and move on. I was relieved when he let go of her, but just after that scene they got together again. I want to pretend that the book ended with the bridge & ipod scene.

B008RYN44U|3.0|No Doubt releases their first studio album  since 2001's [[ASIN:B001O37H1C Rock Steady]], 2012's highly anticipated [[ASIN:B008RYN44U Push And Shove]]. 11 years and a solo stint by Gwent Stefani have come and gone prior to Push & Shove's materialization. The veteran rock outfit manage to balance their ska stylings, adding modern pop and 80s sensibilities.  Solid overall, Push & Shove is sometimes `too safe.'<br /><br />\\"Settle Down, \\" arguably the `crowning achievement,' embraces ska fully, sounding like signature No Doubt.  Catchy and captivating, hook-line \\"Get get get in line and settle down...\\" easily sticks in one's head. \\"Looking Hot\\" is more in line with modern pop, though switches to reggae stylings on the bridge. Gwen lyrically inquires \\"Do You think I'm looking hot? Do you think this hits the spot/how is this looking on me, looking on me...\\" .\\" Stefani's vocals are more present on the chorus than on the verse, where they are covered ever so slightly.<br /><br />\\"One More Summer\\" opens with electric guitar but is eventually superseded by synths and a 4/4 thudding beat.  \\"One More Summer\\" comes off solid, albeit it safe. \\"Push & Shove\\" is characterized by a pounding beat, wacky production, and quick-paced vocals that are manic, and cutting-edge.  Diplo is amongst the list of songwriters (and production contributors) and Busy Signal and Major Lazer guest here. Dubstep, ska, and pop are incorporated creatively here. Stefani's chorus is smooth and quite enjoyable: \\"You work it hard (you work it)/boy you got me good/you push and shove (push and shove)/ooh boy you're hustlin' me...\\"<br /><br />\\"Easy\\" is more standard 'fare' than cutting edge (safe), though Stefani does achieve some solid vocal grit by the end. \\"Gravity\\" also feels safe, though benefits from a catchy chorus (\\"A million miles and it fades/we're into orbit now we're safe/so don't let me go/don't ever let me float away//we're so luck/still holding on/just like Venus and the morning sun/you and me got gravity...\\" \\"Undercover\\" has retro sensibilities and makes sound use of a big bass line, synths, and electric guitar.  Despite being musically sound and compact in duration, the band still sounds a bit 'uninspired.'<br /><br />\\"Undone\\" is highlighted by production and pacing with some timbre and stylistic changes eliminating some predictability.  \\"Sparkle\\" does `tropical-soul' effectively, even if the song is merely solid and not exceptional.  \\"Heaven\\" is notable for its bridge: \\"Don't have to get technical/you know that I want you/Don't have to get technical/you know that I want you.\\"  Closing cut \\"Dreaming the Same Dream\\" again runs on a platform of `sound' but much like most of the latter half of Push & Shove, it is good, not `great.'<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008RYN44U Push And Shove]] works, but does not eclipse the band's past work.  No one expected it to, but many expected more from the veteran band after 11 years off. \\"Settle Down,\\" \\"Looking Hot,\\" and \\"Push & Shove\\" are triumphs, but the rest of the album doesn't maintain the punch of this trio.

B0041B785Y|2.0|The album is okay. It's about time these guys hung it up but I suppose the money is too good or something. I feel they have done all they can do at this point unless they change their sound. This album offers zero new insights. The vocals are beginning to bore me and the music just isn't doing it anymore. The compression is nearing Boris levels of absurdity. I think this is a DR5 recording and that is just too much for me. Must listen at lower volumes or it's painful. No dynamics really left anymore.<br /><br />I will have to give this a few more listens but I much prefer Destroy Erase Improve through obZen. I can take new angles and new styles of play. Nothing and Catch 33 were just that. This band is easily one of the better metal bands around but I think that nobody in metal knows when it's time to quit these days. It doesn't really sound EXACTLY like any of their albums... I think the problem is that it just doesn't go anywhere that hasn't been explored before. obZen did a lot of this same stuff and pretty much better if you ask me. Not a good feeling. If you don't have anything new to say then don't say it, but as I said record labels and money are more the culprit here I assume they had to release something.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is a wonderful book!  Telling the story from the perspective of the young girl who has been murdered allows for dealing with this tragic event in a way that is both suspenseful, but also warm and loving in the eyes of Susie.  I have enjoyed it immensely - Sebold is a great storyteller and writes beautifully and sensitively.  She shows in many ways how much Susie has lost - and what her family has lost.  A wonderful read!

B008J34466|5.0|I really enjoyed this album. The feel of the music was different than a lot of what she'd done before and very fresh. I loved almost every song on the album. The only thing I didn't like was that I bought the digital download here on Amazon and she's tagged as \\"Pink\\" and not P!nk\\", so this album's songs get separated out any time I try to load it to my mp3 player and I can't seem to change it.
B001F4UHFI|2.0|It is more of a documentary in nature than an entertaining movie - kind of slow one. The blu ray was just average. Nicolas Cage justifies his role. I have great respect for soldiers (irrespective of country), I couldn't accept the movie much.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Since i love this show i have nothing but good to say about this series.  I am glad i purchased it and cannot wait for all the rest to come out so i can add them into my collection.  It was a decent price, arrived on time, packaging was in good shape and i had no issues whatsoever.  Very happy with the whole process an product.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|The first alien movie was great but the others we kind of tiresome and kind of did not live up to the franchise potential. This movie is spectacularly made: great story, gat actors and wonderful special effects. Really worth watching. It kind of explains some stuff in the alien movie but other reveiwers have a lady discussed that at length.
0316228532|1.0|I have only read the first half of the Kindle sample.  I am returning it unopened and unread and regret having pre-ordered the book (first time ever with Amazon).  I wish the book description had been more forthcoming about the subject matter and themes.  I didn't expect Harry Potter but I did hope for the same rich literary style, symbolism, and uplifting themes of the HP series.  Life can be dark and ugly but also light and redeeming.  From the reviews I have pored through good and bad there seems to be nothing terribly positive in this book or its resolution. One big Jerry Springer episode.  I was turned off by the characters even before I hit the crude language in the sample chapters and chose not to finish and delete the sample.  There was no hook to keep me reading.  I will wait with anticipation for her next work and hope that is something more inspiring and with more likeable characters.  I love JK Rowling's writing, just not this particular path she has chosen to take.  Maybe next time--but I won't be pre-ordering.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the Holy Bible gives me peace,it is the most interesting and amazing book you will ever read.  So when. you feel there is no hope read your Bible
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Much better than expected. While the two iron man movies were great, one could not really say that about Thor (one of my favorites as a child) or captain America ( never liked him that much) but this is one great movie where all the superheroes are put in a great spotlight. The action starts pretty early on and increases non stop until the end.
1476712042|5.0|This book was amazing! I could not put it down...literally read it in a day and a half. It just roped me in page after page. I could not wait to see who did what next. Absolutely loved it and recommend it!

B005OP3VJ8|5.0|What makes this show so great are the characters. The storylines themselves may not be as great as in the previous seasons. Gloria is somewhat turning into a caricature of herself but that is the only minor point to a wonderful ensemble. It will be interesting to see how the kids evolve as they grow older.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I'm a Dark Shadows fan from the soap opera days of yesteryear.  I also loved the remake starring Ben Cross, which was closer to the original but still a different approach in it's own right.  If you can just forget the story we all know and accept this movie on it's own terms, it's quite entertaining.  I think we all have had our fill of remakes with no creativity.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|okay, so maybe this book has it's many a hot moments, and I have read it all the way through, but I really don't know what the fuss is about.  Any sane woman would not want a man like that.  Okay, he has money, and redeemable qualities, but the controlling personality, the touch issues, and the rest are not an ideal man.  Women who are happily married should stay far away from this book. Gives a very unrealistic picture of love.  the everyday lasting love, is not wrought with all the drama, angst, and only sets women up for disappointment from their lovers - who most likely can not live up to super man Christian Grey.
B0053O89WY|5.0|While the previous season was simply fantastic, season 5 is almost as good. It does somewhat lack some of the more hysterical pieces in last season but overall it is the funniest show on tv or DVD at the moment.
B00514HDNW|1.0|I must say that I went into this expecting it to be more like the movie but better. I didn't know it was basically a short story. This book short story whatever you would consider it was all over the place. It went from being a vampire survival story, to a medical/scientific discovery. The main character seems to be two totally different people as the story unfolds. once the climax comes and it seems you may finally get some really meat from this story it comes to an abrupt end. To me the script writers did an amazing for the movie taking what little the author have them and expanding it into a passable story. The movie wasn't amazing but was much more plausible than the random thoughts that were jotted down and called a book. Just my opinion
B007Q0OV6Q|2.0|I just purchased this advent calendar about an hour ago while I was out shopping for other items at a local brick and mortar store.<br /><br />It must have just been put on the shelves because I didn't see a price for the item but I figured it would be about the same price as last years Star Wars advent calendar.  When I came home and looked at my receipt...Shock.  Almost $50.  I was thinking I was incorrectly charged, but when I came to Amazon to compare prices I realize the price is in the right ball park.<br /><br />I won't re-hash the other reviewers comments, less pieces, smaller ships, etc.  But it does not seem like a good value.  I'm going to return my purchase and wait around for a price drop.  Boo to you Lego.  I'll put aside reason and rational thought often because of my son's big brown eyes and beautifully soft cheeks.  But you've crossed a line.  I guess now is a good a time as any for my son to understand cost and benefit.<br /><br />I'm actually a bit miffed and disappointed so I'll stop typing.

B002VL1CIU|4.0|This book is packed full of great recipes for vegans, vegetarians and anyone with a sweet tooth really. For those of you that fear tasteless or worse weird tasting cookies let me assure you this book will have you and your non-vegan friends coming back for more. I've tried about 15 of the recipes and all have been fantastic.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Clear concise information on all the key ingredients such as flours, sweeteners, a good section explaining substitution and a troubleshooting guide for cookie crises.<br />- Easy to follow recipes (and some more challenging ones if you're in to that type of thing)<br />- No filler. Yes there are cookie books with four hundred different recipes, but this one has a really solid selection (I use this book for 80% of my cookie recipes).<br /><br />Cons<br />- None really. For some of the recipes, I dropped the chocolate content and increased the nuts or dried fruits, or added more banana, but they are still quite tasty if you go by the book.<br />- Each time I bake something from this book I say I will give 3/4 of what I make to friends, but in reality it's only 2/3...<br /><br />Highlights (supremely easy and equally tasty) - Wholesome banana breakfast cookies. Chocolate fudgy oatmeal cookies!<br /><br />What more can be said... Isa and Terry are clearly culinary goddesses!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read!  Could not put down.  I cannot wait for the third book.  I just wish it was going to be out sooner
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Love her deep voice, but, IMHO, this CD is lacking.  Move on and skip this album.  This CD does NOT appeal to me at all.  It has to be selling as well as it is because of the sexed-up cover.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is my first experience with J. K. Rowling. I can only hope she continues to write adult books.  I am an avid reader...how many books have I read in 60 plus years????  Cannot even begin to guess. This book, The Casual Vacancy, is in the top 10 of all time on my list.  I had a slow start because I am normally a mystery, thriller advocate.  Soon, I was swept up into all the characters' personalities, lives, conflicts.  This is not a romance novel..... it is about individuals' shortcomings, misunderstanding of intent and subsequent fall-outs.  The frailty of the human spirit, the pettiness, fears, cruelty of the human psyche and how all of these affect people's lives.  Ms. Rowling's writing skill is so remarkable.  She has taken a group of characters and their lives and placed them into a clear order and class structure within the confines of a small town in England. I KNEW each of these characters, their relationships, their weaknesses, their dependencies. Because the author is so skillful a storyteller I felt like I was actually there and witnessing these events.  Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Great movie material.<br />P.S.  Anyone who finds this book dismal, disappointing, etc.  has totally missed the whole point.  Or, was looking for Harry Potter on every page.
B003O86FMW|5.0|That's both book one and two in less than 5 days i couldnt put them down hands down best books ive ever read so far
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me wanting more. Hard to put it down once i started reading. would recommend this series for anyone to read
B005IQZB14|4.0|I could not stop reading this book as Cheryl engaged me from the first page.  I felt at times as though I was on the trail with her feeling her highs and lows.  The lessons she taught herself, the courage she found in conquering her fears make this a remarkable journey.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just got the new changes and they are GREAT ! I love this app ssssoooo much ! Thank you YouVersion for all your efforts ! Keep up the good work !
B000JLQS7E|3.0|As the lead reviewer already pointed out, this is the reissue of a film already issued years ago on VHS and DVD ([[ASIN:B00002NDLW Verdi - Aida / Maazel, Chiara, Pavarotti, La Scala]]), documenting a performance given at La Scala in 1985, in the production of Luca Ronconi, with the Radames of Pavarotti, the Aida of Maria Chiara and the Amneris of Ghena Dimitrova. It isn't exactly the same cast as on the CD-set recorded around the same time, ([[ASIN:B0000041S0 Verdi: Aida / Chiara, Pavarotti, Dimitrova, Nucci, Burchuladze, Maazel]]). The principals are the same, but on the DVD Nicolai Ghiaruov replaces Paata Burchuladze as Ramfis (who in turns becomes the Pharaoh in the place of Luigi Roni), and Juan Pons is Amonasro instead of Leo Nucci.<br /><br />The difference with the previous DVD release is that the new one now comes with a bonus DVD, from 1988, a 78-min program on the making of Aida, with commentaries by Pavarotti, Grace Bumbry, Renata Tebaldi, Carlo Bergonzi, Eva Turner, a section with brief vocal excerpts from Aida featuring Enrico Caruso, Emmy Destinn, Eva Turner, Aureliano Pertile, Ebe Stignani, Beniamino Gigli, Giovanni Martinelli, Renata Tebaldi, and Grace Bumbry. Scenes from the performance are also shown with commentary about them.<br /><br />In all honesty, I haven't seen it. I have seen and reviewed the previous release. Whether it will give incentive to the potential buyer to go ahead with the new release is, of course, his choice. I refer to my review and the many other ones under the entry for the previous release. By almost universal consensus it seems, the singing of the three principals is great, the production and filming provide no reason to want to see this more than once, and maybe even less than that (even if the specific reasons may vary). I differ from the general consensus in liking, in fact, the lack of any acting of both Pavarotti and Dimitrova - if you consider that \\"to act\\" is to move around the stage and make faces. I consider thatAida is vocal theatre, not \\"theatrical\\" theatre, and I find the very small expressions on these two's faces far more expressive and intense than any facial antics by some of their esteemed colleagues on other DVDs. I also differ from the general consensus in finding Maria Chiara as Aida unbearable to watch, with over-expressive, cheaply melodramatic and redundant gestures, as if she was trying not to imitate but to caricature the actresses from the silent film era - so unbearable in fact that it comes in the way of my enjoyment of her singing. So as long as I'm going to shut my eyes to listen, I might as well buy the CDs instead. The bonus DVD here gives me no additional incentive.
0385344333|4.0|I was a little apprehensive about this new Reacher novel in the series after reading through some of the feedback - but must say I enjoyed this novel just as much as all the others in the series.  If you're a Reacher fan, it's another solid novel in the series.  Keep looking forward to the next ones!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in YEARS! I really couldn't stop reading it or put it down!
B003TO5414|5.0|Enjoyed the video once we got a dvd player that would play it. he information was printed there I just did not read. The series is enjoyable another good one from BBC.
B009IQG5LK|5.0|This movie is a timeless classic in my book...I remember seeing this in the theater with my brother & sister and my mom & step dad when I was just a kid, have loved it ever since!  It's about time this movie got a Blu-Ray release!  I for one will be snatching this up for my Blu-Ray collection upon it's release!  I don't buy too many older movies on Blu-Ray, but there are just some movies that are classic enough & worthy of buying over again which each new format, and to me this is one of those type of movies!  I'll be patiently awaiting this come December and trade up my DVD copy for it!  Heck, I may even just keep the DVD too so that I have both formats...that's how much I love this movie!  To those of you in the younger generation or anyone who hasn't seen this movie, I would recommend giving it a watch...it's very entertaining, I suggest giving it a watch!  I for one will be snagging this upon release!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Let me start by saying that this review is in large part, a comparison to it's first part, Bared To You, which I loved.  I still appreciated the flow of writing and certain aspects of the characters but where we were deeply involved with the lives of the protagonists and achingly curious about the villains of Bared to You, I find that Reflected In You leaves us with shallow connections with all characters and their story lines.  Simply put the characters have changed and actions and thoughts have now made them more fantasy than they were in the first place.  There is now a disconnect and the genre of the writing has shifted.  Where once we read about a complicated romance, I feel we picked up with a different but similar story that can now only be characterized as a suspense.<br /><br />Reflected In You contained a lot of confusing interactions for the characters, all of which is pulled together in the end.  We are denied certain interactions and character developments that seemed almost promised in bared to you.  Prominent characters who once seemed to seek out normal, healthy lives and interactions now seem to have abandoned all sense of functionality in the real world and exhibit sociopathic, co-dependent tendencies.  I felt like Eva and Gideon became a Bonnie and Clyde of sorts by the end.  Cary became a secondary character when he was once very important to the story line.<br /><br />Emotionally, Reflected in you leaves a lot to be desired.  There are still the incredible sex scenes but in this book sex becomes a tool more so than in the first and loses some of it's intimacy for me.<br /><br />I still appreciated the writing style and the story was okay but if you are expecting to read something that is a strong link to the first book in this series, I think Sylvia Day may have missed the mark being caught up in mass market appeal and the time constraints she had to released the next part of the series. Something here is lost in translation.
0385360177|4.0|The story is captivating when you listen to the words. You can visualized the scenes as if you are a part of the book. I can't wait to read or listen to the 3rd part of the trilogy.
140132634X|5.0|I have loved all of Mitch's books.  This one just came along at a time that my adult children are going through troubled times and at times all seemed hopeless.  I was able to use this book to soothe my fears and share with my children that insight into \\"life is not hopeless\\", and it is never too late to forgive or be forgiven.  My favorite quotes were \\"It's never too late or never too soon\\" as well as \\"Time is not something you can give back\\".  I will listen to it again and again.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Insteresting how so many people are criticizing the book, saying it is silly and pourly written.<br />I think the book was great knowing that its purpose was not to be the next Ullyses but rather entertain and relax
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is just not my thing. A ton of people love it & that's great, but I was unimpressed. But, then again, I hold a completely different view of love & sex than most people in America today. That's ok, if it's your thing you'll probably love it. Not this girl, though.
B0016CTX1S|5.0|In my opinion 1 of the greatest albums of all time. Stones \\"Acid\\" album a step outside the box but an absolute masterpiece. And the album cover is a lot of fun too!
B008BO61BE|5.0|This was the first album I bought as a teenager! I rode my ten speed bicycle 5 miles to the local record store and bought it with my own money! I bought it on cassette! Rode my bike home and put it into the cassete player and was completely blown away! 30 years later I am still completely blown away! I havent taken it out of my car cd player in two weeks! I play to work and home from work!  Long live the Priest!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is such a good free game, which you can definitely sink some hours into. The game allows you to buy upgrades with real money, but it's easy to buy upgrades by just collecting enough coins in the game. Support for Amazon GameCircle is pretty cool too, since it allows you to shoot for achievements and compare your stats to other players'. Can't go wrong with this game!
B00008WG3U|4.0|Cd was received quickly and as described. NOFX is always a good choice to rock out to any day, any where, any time.
0486284735|5.0|I researched this book, but it does not come out and tell you that the dover thrift edition is unabridged, it states something to the effect of \\"like orginal 1813 writing\\". So this edition, the dover thrift edition is unabridged.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it gives you reminders for planned readings as well as many plans to get you into the word.very easy to use all the while hiving you options to make it more organized like colors  for highlighting and a note pad. the best part is that the app allows you to share the word through several social networks!
0316228532|1.0|I am a HUGE harry potter fan, and was very excited about this book. I ordered it months before it was released. I was very disappointed. It has a lot of swearing in it, as well as a lot of sexual references, and I did not make it very far into the book. One thing I really loved about the harry potter series was how clean they were. This is so close to a different writing style I would not have suspected it to be written by the same author if I had not know previously.<br /><br />I would suggest renting or borrowing from the library before adding it to your collection to make sure this is a book you would like before spending the money on it.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|It is here. The long awaited follow up to \\"Over The Under\\" is finally released and it doesn't disappoint. The production is a little more gritty than their previous album but it still have that very organic and dynamic sound that characterize them making you feel like you are in the rehearsal studio with the band. At first I was skeptical of the EP series idea but if this is a signs of thing to come then there won't be a lot to complain about.
B008XG1X18|5.0|on my Kindle Fire it is awesome! I can use it in every room of the house especially in the kitchen for great recipes!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|spent way to many a good quarter on this game at the fair.  there is no real winning but at least I'm not losing all the coins in my piggy bank.
B008602KQI|4.0|I definitely enjoyed this movie. I have read the books, and personally think this movie is for those who have. I'm not saying that people who haven't read the book will dislike it, but it definitely helps as there are a few elements from the book that I believe are not fully explored in the movie. Otherwise this is an entertaining dystopian society movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|large buttons...very easy to use...keeps a history of your previous transaction just under your total...I can always see it lit up unlike my stupid dollar-store calculator that keeps running out of solar power....and this app is FREE.  Need I say more?
0375805613|5.0|My child has a love affair with Grover in this book, The Monster at the end of this Book! This is the first thing he looks through after school and the last thing he looks through before he goes to bed.<br /><br />Something about Grover really speaks to young children. Grover is serious and silly and anxious about life. He's pretty \\"human\\" in  that regard and I think that's why this character is so appealing to readers of all ages.<br /><br />If you have access to the same title in your app store, I recommend the interactive version too, it brings the pages of this book to life and Grover's voice is authentic. I also recommend the other monster book, featuring Grover and Elmo. It brings a lot of laughter!
B007SGM084|1.0|I am not a fan and don't get what all the hype is about. I thought it was poorly written and boring.  By book two I was just skimming over all the \\"he's so hot, my loins are on fire, but he's so f%ed up\\" stuff.  Author completely overused salacious, lascivious, and other words. Just like I hate to walk out on a movie I've paid for, I hate not finishing a book (or in this case three books) I've paid for, but it's 16 hours of my life I will never get back! What a waste if time. Even the few plot \\"twists\\" were completely predictable and not worth it.  If you want a real BDSM book read The Story of O. If you want romance go with the books with Fabio on the cover. If you want to read how-messed-up some-dude-is but-it's-ok-cuz-he's-so-damn-hot, over and over then this is the book for you. This trilogy was not worth the money or the time!!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Scorching as ever, but I found Gideon to be a sinister presence and he' s more 50 mill shades of f*** up than Christian Grey. And there's not much I like about him unfortunately. And we FINALLY hear from G about his abused past but as he's driving a car??? It was a total letdown in presentation and drama...I was waiting for a Big Bangg moment for this event in the story.<br /><br /> The secondary characters who were so built up in the first book--messed up Cary and especially evil brother Christopher...primed to play a big sinister role on book 1 and yet nothing happened, NOTHING, just more of the same actually a 2 minute appearance, as with Gideon's mother.....verrrry disappointing, lost opportunities there big time... and they stayed on the outer sidelines. Very outer. And the big Enemy/Threat of the story for our hero and heroine is kept totally off camera and we don't even hear about him until the verrrry end when it's already to late for him. Hello??? All that buildup and no payoff.<br /><br /> Of course there's a heck of a lot of sex which I'm not sure propelled us forward but just further into Eva and GC's twisted obsession with each other. All this \\" I need you, etc, bla, bla\\" (started getting on my nerves)=Psychology 101= bad news for a relationship!  Their issues and obsessive need to be saved thru each other will take eons of therapy to work thru. The third book is going to have to start \\"10 years later\\" at this rate. Especially with the ending we got here....whoa!!! Uh oh, now they're in it wayyyyy deeeeep!! I enjoyed the ride, but still...ugh.
B005LAJ1H2|4.0|After watching season one, I was pleasantly surprised to find the story gets more involved during season two. The characters are developed to a greater degree than in season one. Not just good guys vs bad guys shoot em up.
B008XG1X18|3.0|i lovee pinterest! BUT the app keeps messing up and i keep having to close it out all the time. it randomly just shuts down and the more Im on it the more it does it! its getting very frustrating! almost not worth the app, its easier to just go to the website instead. i hav a kindle fire. hopefully they get this fixed very very soon.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Wow! I love this it has a lot of great relaxing sounds compared to some other apps. I love the star that lets you pick to dream or meditate. I use it to lucid dream. Works great! Thanks Relax Melodies!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|the game itself is realllyyy fun! but the graphics are horrible and blurry on kindle fire. but overall I love it
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was the BEST adventure game out there!! I loved the inventory wall. I felt like I was staring in a role on Law and Order!  Big fish needs to make hundreds more like this!!
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|My nephews (ages 8 and 5) visited us over the summer and didn't seem interested in watching this movie, until they realized it's not just some animated Peter Pan film.  I was surprised they had not already watched this version, since they are (unfortunately) movie-buffs at such young ages.  I'm so glad I recorded this on my dvr before their long summer visit!  They were mesmerized all over again and again by the characters, the plot, the danger, the tenderness of family ties, etc.  I knew I had to buy this DVD for them to enjoy at home!  While they stayed for a few weeks over the summer, they watched this movie at least 5 times if not more!!!  I think I enjoyed watching them excited about watching a well-made movie as much as they enjoyed watching it.  I highly recommend this version of Peter Pan to boys and girls alike (for any age)!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|this was a great app fix problem<br />before you able to save in computer now it does not show<br /><br />after last update will not start at all.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Have read all Lee Child's creations.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is his homeless hero!  Jack has a built in alarm clock, mind like the best mathematician, head butting, master of<br />logic and whip ass with no strings attached.<br /><br />It is awesome escapist page flipping entertainment!!!<br /><br />Jack Reacher can take Mitch Rapp (but they are kindred spirits)!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book has so many twist and turns that my nose bleed a few times. the book has a wonderful story behind it and worth checking it out
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|When Lana Del Rey first started making the news, I didn't pay any attention. Then I downloaded \\"Born To Die\\" \\"Video Games\\" and \\"Blue Jeans,\\" but just assumed the rest of the album was filler. Then one day I previewed the rest of the songs on Amazon and was surprised to find the whole album was just as good or better than her hits. There's really not a bad track on here, which is of course very rare these days. Don't judge her by her SNL performance (feel free to judge her for it, but not by it, if that makes sense). Also, I'm a guy, so don't assume it's just for girls. Her lyrics are also very interesting and got me to think about them, whereas I normally don't really pay attention to lyrics because I assume they are frivolous and only chosen to match the sound. Bottom line, it's well worth listening to and may well surprise you.
B004S5FVJS|5.0|I enjoy reading David Baldacci . He puts together a very good plot,and unlike many authors You cannot pick the villian until the very last
B0017V7GTY|5.0|I bought American Slang around the time it came out, and while it is a great album that I enjoyed very much, I never thought to listen to the '59 Sound. I bought the album about a month ago, and I can't put it down. It had to grow on me (first time through I liked it but it didn't sink in) but after a few listens I was completely hooked. If it's not my favorite album ever, it's right up there. Every song is at least \\"really good\\" and some are simply incredible. Handwritten and American Slang are great albums, but this album takes the cake (I haven't listened to their lesser known work. Yet.) It is possible to overstate how good this album is, but you would have to put in a serious effort to do so. I just wish I had listened to it sooner.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely  fabulous book. I would highly recommend to anyone. I was a little apprehensive at first when I thought about the macabre story line, but was so enthralled in the action... Can't wait to get my hands on the next two!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game it is fun to play and waste time. fun to use it on the kindle fire.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|As usual, Baldacci writes a compelling story.  It isn't a huge stretch to think that it could have actually happened but most of us won't ever run into people like either the heroes or the villains described or the situations encountered.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|The Star Trek Enterprise series was totally enjoyable. As the series went on I was able to get into all the characters and really liked the relationships between them. The quality of the dvds was great, and being in widescreen was a plus. I will watch the whole series again, and would recommend it to anyone who is a serious Star Trek fan.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have learned more about the history of the 2nd world war and the faschist idea than I did in college.  Follet always gives as much history as he can from the eyes of his characters.  Each character is the voice of his or her part of the world.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read this because my friends told me I should, and if you read the first book, this is really just more of the same.  It's entertaining, don't get me wrong, and has given me some.. er. inspiration?  But as far as fine writing or complex plot go, it's a bit lackluster.  Enjoy this book for what it is-- a fast, somewhat mindless read with extremely detailed lascivious passages that are intended to awaken your libido and spark your curiosity.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon cross, what more can i say! very very good book!  I felt my heart break for her!  Now i can't wait for book 3!
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Could not get Blu Ray disk to work at first, but did finally do so.  First Blu Ray I have had, only bought DVDs before this.  Blu Ray Player was on sale couple years ago.  DVD of Iron Man II worked fine, movie good.  Digital copy licence out of date so dropped it one star.  Also bought Avengers at the same time, and luckily watched IRON Man II first.  Liked the movie.  Going back to it after watching the Avengers,  could not compare.  You need to see Iron Man II before the Avengers, I think.  Buy or rent the Avengers and you will not be unhappy.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|As many other Bared to You fans I was anxiously waiting for Reflected in You to be released. I bought this book the moment it became available in the kindle market and immediately dove in. The first half of the book was amazing but then I seriously began getting frustrated with Gideon's behavior. I really felt like Eva became a weak character and that ruined a majority of this book for me. In Bared to You she was so strong willed and she didn't put up with any of Gideon's crap and in this one I felt like she lost her spark. I think had Sylvia Day added just one more chapter at the end it would've saved the book but I was greatly unsatisfied with the way it closed. I still have hope for a great ending though and look forward to December.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was a terrific read.  Kept me spellbound until the end. I am ready to download the next book by this author.  Read Gone Girl first then went back to read her previous books.
B008EQIK90|5.0|What the movie lacks in quality it makes up in crazy humor. It's always nice to see cute guys making an ass of themselves.<br />I watched it twice.
B008764ZQ4|4.0|This was another Amazon.com purchase that gave me agreat reward for placing my confidence them.  This iS my type of music and I proud of the great deal from Amazon.  Recommend it to all classic rockers.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I just got back from watching the digitally remastered version in the theatre tonight.  While this was already my favorite movie ever, I can say that the new version is simply gorgeous.  I am really happy that I had the chance to see it on the big screen, and would highly recommend that.  However, I'm looking forward to the BD collectors edition as it has a lot of neat extras that to me, a fan, are well worth the money.  They showed a few of them in the theatre and I can't wait to watch them again without the idiots behind me who insisted on discussing carpet any time the actual movie wasn't on.  At any rate, this is the greatest cinematic achievement ever, and if you have never seen it then do yourself a favor and buy it on Blu-Ray when it comes out in November.  Then do yourself a bigger favor and if it ever comes to a theatre near you be sure you get out to see it.  You'll be glad you did.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I have played lots of big fish games. and I have to say this is one of my favorites !  enjoy!
B000HC2LI0|1.0|I purchased this DVD set exactly a month, for my husband, who's a huge West Wing fan. Imagine my disappointment when the DVDs in the fourth season did not play at all and kept skipping. I'm appalled that Amazon would sell such an atrociously faulty product. I want a working replacement for this set and would be looking into requesting one right away.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I have this app for my kindle fire and I love it has very good graphics for a tablet game. One of the best games I have played in a long time.
B004XISI4A|5.0|My children read these books and recommended that I would love them.  All five books are just amazing and I can't wait for the next one. George R R Martin is an incredible story teller.
B005KMX866|5.0|A really great cover album of old Rock & Roll classics, Chris Isaak does an amazing job of creating a sound so similar to several legendary singers like Elvis and Johnny Cash but still manages to make them his own.
1476712042|5.0|I love this book read it 3 times! cant wait for the 2nd one to come out I need more
B008MG1E4A|5.0|One of the best military books ive read to date.<br />I don't believe this book should be kept from readers.
0739352989|1.0|This is a poorly written story of a dipsy uni-dimensional virgin college girl who meets a weird, kinky, 30-something billionaire, and they form a contractual bond for unrealistic dominant-submissive sex. Period. No plot. No character development. Dialogue on a ninth-grade level. This was written by an obviously imaginative woman, and it is clearly intended for homely, middle age women who spend a lot of their boring lives living vicariously through day-time soap operas and hoping that some day a rich handsome man  will find them irresistible and sweep them off their feet and whisk them into a world where they are taken care of and treated to daily and nightly doses of endless orgasms for merely biting their lower lip. The fact that this series has sold so many copies is a sad commentary on our society. After reading a few pages I felt the need to take a shower in the same way that one would feel after wallowing around in a pig pen. Don't waste your money. If you are looking for sexual stimulation from reading, go get a copy of an adult magazine. Same thing.
B005LAII6W|5.0|I found this movie to be action packed and a complete mind trip. I loved Milla Jovovich(Alice), Michelle Rodriguez(Rain), Boris Kodjoe (Luther), Johann Urb(Leon), and Li Bingbing (Ada) in this film. The movie kept us on the edge of our seats. I love how the characters introduced from the video games stayed true to cannon. I love the subtle romance between Leon and Ada and hope to see more of them in future films. This part also stayed true to cannon.
0525952926|4.0|\\"You have set our iniquities before You,<br />Our secret sins in the light of Your countenance.\\" -- Psalm 90:8 (NKJV)<br /><br />The plotting for this book is beyond my wildest imagination. With a relatively few characters, Mr. Follett manages to give us close-ups of almost every one of the major events in the United States, England, Wales, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Spain during the 1930s through World War II. There are also bits and pieces of other nations touched upon.<br /><br />I found myself pretty comfortable with that approach, except towards the end where I felt he went over the top in terms of the coincidences the plot brings together. It left me feeling that he had lost perspective on his story.<br /><br />I thought that the treatment of Germany was especially well done. He did a fine job of giving a sense of what it was like to be opposed to the Nazis. Some of the lesser known evils of that regime are also exposed.<br /><br />One of the book's strengths comes in the way that Mr. Follett showed the harmful consequences of each nation's governmental and economic systems. It's a more balanced look at the nations involved than can normally be found in a novel.<br /><br />The book's main weakness is that the events dominate the story a bit too much. Most people wanted a good family saga from Mr. Follett more than they wanted a detailed history lesson. I was a history major so there wasn't anything new here for me. I marveled at how much effort went into including all these details, but I suspect that they might seem excessive to those with less interest.<br /><br />Be glad those days are behind us!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awsome best book ever and im not going to.spoil the ending but lets just say they will have one tough juorney ahead of them
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i love, love, loved this book and i think it was the best yet. so many personalities! and finally yes, we get a look into annabeths world! the cliffhangers in this book make you wanna scream &#34;nooooo!!!!!!!!&#34; (cue rain and thunder) but seriously good book. and i cannot wait til next year!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The S&M is sensational, but the whole story line is amazing.  How Ana & Christian make sacrifices for one another is such a tug at your heart!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was absolutely mesmerized reading Mark's account of our Navy Seals heroic task.<br />I always knew Obama didn't kill Osama....now I'm sure!
B004FV1ESW|5.0|The film is outstanding and feels incredibly authentic. Affleck gives a cool collected performance and there is a vibrant energy to Jeremy Renner through out the whole flick. Very cool and appealing to anyone who loves a good heist film.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I liked Pinterest on my desktop computer, but this app makes it so much better. It's easy to navigate, simple, and fast. I use Pinterest way more often now.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|The author of this book provides a detailed, documented account of Islam.  It has been one of the best reads I have discovered since starting my quest to learn and understand as much as I can about this religion.  This book is truly a wake-up call!  It is frightening to see the diabolical and methodical way in which Islam is rapidly attempting to take over the world, while Americans and Europeans gradually allow this creeping scourge to worm it's way into every facet of our societies.  Maybe if enough of us read this book, a true awakening of the threat the author has  presented in will be realized.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Love this author. Always enjoy his book and this one was no exception. Can't wait for his next one to come out.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game has it all! great character creation with orc and undead options- lots of quests and opponents- huge map w beautiful. terrain. Honestly I didn't mean to buy it,  it kind of snuck into the free games but now that I play it,  its well worth a few dollars :)
0553062182|5.0|Delivered as promised and in good condition.<br />The book validates who I am and offers new insights and perspectives in living with this trait.  Nice to know I am not the only one!
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Viktor Frankl has done the what no other book about the Holocaust has accomplished. Rather than dwelling on the atrocities of the guards and the evils of Nazism, he has shown us what the strength of the human spirit can accomplish.<br />He describes a new way of looking at human interaction called Logotherapy, which explains why some people survived the camps with their spirits intact, while other who were even in better condition gave up and died.<br />I loved the way he explains a difficult concept, and found myself re-reading several passages. He is a great philosopher and writer who understands humanity at a level few of us ever appreciate.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I rarely say \\"wow!\\" when I see a film, but this did it.  I honestly thought this was going to be a bad movie for a number of reasons, so I put off watching it for a long time.  Had I known Joss Whedon (my favorite director) was directing it, I would have watched it sooner.  The action, the dialog, the acting, the effects; everything was fantastic, and I didn't have a single \\"oh that's stupid\\" moment -- which I thought I was going to have with a big budget movie that was capitalizing on prior blockbusters. Very very cool, and a must see if you're at all a fan of comics and superheroes.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have enjoyed reading all three of these books.  I hated to finish. :( I was leary on reading them but i found it to be the most amazing love story.  I think every women wants to meet a Christian Grey.
B000006OS2|2.0|Unfortunatly this DVD is poor quality. The sound track doesn't always match the mouths of actors and there is a shadow or double image particularly in the beginning. I was very disapointed. Thinking of returning this DVD.<br />Bird Lady
B002T921DE|4.0|... this is still a good concert video. The only songs I truly missed were \\"I Want Your Sex\\" and \\"Monkey\\". The only other issue I had with the concert is the same issue I had with the Faith concert I saw in 1988 ... he constantly turns the microphone over to audience. If the preceding issues did not exist, this would have been a GREAT concert and video.
1451627297|5.0|Brilliant story about time travel and what might happen if we could go back and change the past. What course will the world take if one man goes back in time to save JFK? I highly recommend you read 11/22/63 and find out.
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day, what really happened in the raid to get Osama Bin Laden. Excellent book written by a highly respected Navy seal who was there. This man and all those like him are the best America has to offer and should be thanked often for they're service.The book is very detailed and dramatic. Will keep your attention. Makes you feel like you were there. Read it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got this for my son and I like it just as much as him! Very fun for kids to watch the coins and prizes falling down.
B004NOH9LC|1.0|Unwatchable. Two hours of Harrison Ford's ridiculous imitation of Jack Nicholas, complete with the awful, greasy, combed-straight-back hairdo. Contrived, stilted, unbelievable scenes with dialogue that made me cringe; a festival of stereotyping. Wholly wasted potential and an utter waste of two hours.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|We watched Big Miracle 3 or 4 times in just a couple of days.  It is a very good, clean movie--family friendly.  Thank you.
B005LAII8A|3.0|Spoilers Below. . .<br /><br />Looper is not a very good film. It threatens to be a good film. Halfway to three/quarters of the way through it does become a good film, and quite interesting. Then you realize it's just copying the contrivances of a good mystery and suspense film without being one itself. There's almost a formula. Subject us to 45 minutes of nonsense. Make it interesting, so I suppose we feel smart for having sat through it. Then have a righteous conclusion. Looper is 'well made' and has good acting, I give it 3 stars, but it does not get the 'thumbs up' of approval.<br /><br />I suspect Willis is supposed to be the star of the film, and the hero. He's the one who kicks the most ass. That's how you can tell, I think. It turns out his younger self is the hero. Couldn't they have made his younger self, couldn't they have made the two actors look more alike? I'm not usually a big fan of Bruce Willis movies for whatever reason. I did like the film Twelve Monkeys. The Fifth Element is OK too - a guilty pleasure (had forgot about that one). Bruce Willis is the highlight of Looper; he gives a good performance. It doesn't hurt that he's the first character in the film who makes sense. He calls his younger, drug using, criminal self an 'idiot who doesn't know what he's doing'. This is more a dark Western than anything else. Using the word 'Looper' in place of Hit-Man does not make it a science fiction movie. Using the phrase closing the loop does not make it a profound one.<br /><br />It wasn't until thinking about it later, well after the movie was over, that I wondered, what was Bruce Willis doing? Bruce Willis was killing so he could be with his wife, as I remember it. Not to prevent her from being killed. He was killing so he could be with her. How was he going to get back to the future to do this? We see no way for character's in 2040 to return to 2070 (and why are all the characters dressed and equipped as if it's the old west)? If he meets up with his wife he'll be 60 years old and she'll be 20.<br /><br />Other than the humor and the insight of the Willis character I didn't really like any of the characters. They are all 'anti-heroes', I think. Each is selfish, at best - until the final sacrifice at the end. What is it they say? I think I was kinda hoping the giant crocodile would eat all of them, including the sullen little kid. Perhaps they would all appear before a Looper gun, one at a time and 'pow' it would be over. Frankly the only promising character is the older 'Rainmaker'. At least he is 'closing the loops' which would mean there would no longer be these assassinations taking place, wouldn't it?<br /><br />What does this film do other than desensitizing us to the murdering of people you've only seen for 2 seconds, and to homelessness, and tell us the way to a better world is to kill yourself? Is it a bit disturbing a young man who lives for today, uses drugs and is a professional hit man appears as a normal every day person, someone the movie goer is expected to identify with easily?ife he'll be 60 years old and she'll be 20.<br /><br />Other than the humor and the insight of the Willis character I didn't really like any of the characters.

0446547573|5.0|I could not put it down start to finish. I have never been disappointed with any of his books.  Keep busy Mr. S. we are waiting.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|the movie was good and had quite a bit of action. I love Charlize Theron and she plays a great part in this.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|In my opinion, this book was great. Even though it was full of clichés, Riordan found a way of making them funny. I have read most (if not all) of his books and I think he is a great author because of the way he blends the modern world with ancient greco-roman mythology. I am a great fan of mythology and science fiction, and comparing this to other great works (A Game of Thrones), I find it is a bit too predictable. However, I find this book a good, casual read to make time pass without really getting bored. However, the ending (no spoilers) is a bit different to his other works (and dealing with a very different feeling than most of his other books) and I find this really redeeming. I recommend this book to anyone from 10-15 who likes mythology and doesn't mind a book being too predictable.
B0072X2NUS|1.0|I guess I just expected MUCH more from these two artist. I'm a big DM fan and have all their CD's. I also enjoy have both Yazz CD's and a Erasure CD. That doesn't make me and expert, but at least a qualified critic.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|I have a lot of respect for Matt Damon for narrating this very insightful film. If you really want to know what brought the USA and much of the world to the brink of financial collapse then please watch this film. The scary part for me is that virtually nothing has been done to to reign in the greedy Wall Street behavior that got us into this mess. Without common sense regulations to stop this highly risky type of trading by Wall Street \\"insiders\\" it will happen all over again.
B0099G4Y26|4.0|My wife is a huge Pink fan. She has all her albums. I enjoyed her singles that she's released but there was only a few songs I really liked off her old albums that she didn't release on the radio. I have to say, after listening to this album, there's a much larger percentage of this album that I really got into. There's still a couple slower songs that I skip (Beam Me Up for example) but on this album I'm happy to report that all the \\"upbeat\\" songs and most of the \\"slower\\" songs have even got me singing along. If you're a big Pink fan, you'd most likely give this five stars. It is a must have for you. As someone who was on the fence I give it four stars because she really won me over with this one.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great author.  Do not attempt to read this if you are very easily offended due to strong language & subject matter.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Real fun games for all age gamers. Play with my son and wife and had a good rest time. thanks!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I programmed the app to tell me out loud when my charge gets to 20% and lower. I love it.
B00338QENI|5.0|Fantastic book. Great writing. Wonderful true story. I highly recommend. Henrietta's place in history was saved by Rebecca Skloot - and Rebecca's life was changed as well. Buy the print book - the pictures tell a lot of the tale too.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I don't write many reviews in fact i hardly ever write revews but after reading this book once I immediately went back to the beginning and started all over again and now feel compelled to tell everyone that that this book was truly amazing. If you read the first book and like me got caught up in the relationship that was going on between Eva and Gideon you would be hard pressed to not get sucked into this wildly erotic and heartfelt romance that was happening between these two damaged individuals.  Their relationship is as many people have described, a roller coaster but boy is it worth the ride.  I had a relationship like this once and it was as hot and as terrible at times as it was depicted here but in the end I had no regrets. I have such high hopes for these two and can't wait to read the next book to see how they wind up. If you are not a lover of sexy scenes then you shouldn't read this series but if you are you will not be disappointed becase these are some of the most erotic scenes I've ever read (and not been grossed out by).  However if you are not into sexy scenes you should move on now because this book will test your limits. If you're on the fence I say read on my friend and enjoy where they take you.  I did...
1583334386|5.0|I usually don't like to write reviews for a book I haven't finished yet, but I was in the middle of recommending this book to my sister in an email when in dawned on me that I should leave a review before I forget! To sum it up, this is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. I'm sure that will change over time, but given my current life sitauation, I find the book particularly pertinent (yay alliteration). I've been struggling with an eating disorder for 2 years now and am having the hardest time breaking the habbit. Obviously there is more involved to an eating disorder than just summing up the willpower, but it does play a HUGE role. At the end of the day, addictions are choices. I know that's a controversial thing to say, but more and more research and addiction treatment facilities are confirming this. Turning to a substance in a time of stress or whatever is a choice we make, and through repeatedly performing this action, our brain creates \\"shortcuts\\" that enable us to do it more often/efficiently and make refusing very difficult and anxiety-inducing. This is where the books proves invaluable. The author understands all of this and explains it in a very clear, well-researched manner and then provides strategies for improving one's ability to say no, as well as all the ways our primitive brains trick us into saying \\"yes\\", so we can avoid these traps better. I'm still far from cured (and only half way done with book), but I'm confident that applying many of the book's principals to my treatment will give me a better chance of recovery and happiness. NOTE: This is NOT an addiction treatment program! Most of the subjects in the book are less \\"hardcore\\", and case studies include those trying to quit smoking, lose weight, be more productive at work/school, exercise more, give up obsessive email/facebook checking, etc. But a fascinating read for anyone, even willpower masters, who is interested in how our brains function and the conflicts that can often arise!
B008B11RLQ|5.0|What a great collection! Twenty mini replicas of original Elvis albums - right down to the LP covers. I do actually have all these in their original 33 rpm format (most in near mint condition). I haven't played them all yet, but the sound quality is excellent on those I have listened to. Recommended to all Elvis collectors!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|TubeMate is a nice little simple app that lets you download the actual video files that the Youtube player on their site or the Youtube app access. The interface is just youtube's mobile browser site, but the app shows a green down arrow on the video page that you press to get the video. Click that, and it gives you the choice to pick from the available resolutions. I'm glad you can get this from Amazon appstore now, because updating by downloading the apk from Tubemate's site was annoying.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I LOVE this game. There need to be more games like this one.  Cannot wait for Enigmatis 2 to come out.
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|I thought this was like the old Pac-Man game.  It is difficult to remember the do's and don'ts when you have to go back and forth.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This really is a good game.  entertaining and fun with very good graphics.  highly recommend to anyone who is looking for an arcade style game with an RPG feel.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love the game. keeps you busy when you try to decide the best placement. just like games from when I was a kid!
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Solid writing, kept my attention but the plot is a little far fetched    and  doesn‘t  really fit. Ending was  predictable
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|I was thinking of a slightly lower rating because of the storyline itself but, the epic fight scenes made me go higher. I would recommend it absolutely for the fight scenes. Also, rewatchablility factors into how I judge movies. The story seemed tired and predictable, which was a little disappointing as the rest of it was so exciting. The storyline seemed only to exist, in order to explain the fight scenes. It was the only thing that dragged the film down for me. The acting was very well done, which I was especially surprised that the lead is a newbie to acting. I would love to see more movies with her, she's a natural and an absolute BAMF. It is rare to see actresses to believably pretend to be tough. With this lead actress, there was no pretending, she could mess you up. It made me proud to be a girl. At least watch it once, to see a chick believably holding her own in a fight against guys. The DVD has nice behind the scenes featurettes, which were really cool to see how the cast interacts and how some injuries happened during filming.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|LOVE IT! No problems &amp; I love the brightness/page color settings! I've been using this app for 6+ months &amp; its really been great!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am enjoying having a link to the Weather Channel on my new Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The resolution on the Kindle is great.  There are so many Android apps on Amazon.<br /><br />Liz Carpenter
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|As with most websites Amazon is poorly designed. Their digital movie downloads don't display how much has downloaded nor when it is a good time to play your movie without constant buffering interruptions. The sound was off and image was pixelated, had to restart several times to correct this problem. Awful design. Blockbuster.com let's you know when your movie is ready for uninterrupted play. Amazon's site also doesn't give you shipping cost on individual physical items when purchasing several items, not even at check out! Awful design again.<br /><br />Rating is for Amazon. As for 'The Avengers' - it's a great movie!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The packaging is very nice and easy to access numbered discs to follow the series in order. The \\"file\\" system for each season is attractive and nice to diplay in my \\"mancave\\". West Wing was one of my all time favorites and I am happy to be able to watch it over and over in sequence.
B007OWG3LM|5.0|From start to finish, this work is some of their finest.  So easy to be transported to a state of nothingness.  Enjoy responsibly ;o)
0316228532|1.0|I had been really looking forward to this new book from a talented author.  I stared reading it and couldn't continue.  It was so base and disgusting.  The language was terrible.  I didn't find any redeeming qualities in the book or the people in the book.
B003XQRZ7E|3.0|I was interested in this band for Joe and Jason more than Hughes.  I like the instrumentals, and Glenn plays fine bass.  I just can't handle a whole album of his vocals.  It is like the football running back with speed that doesn't know when to slow down.  He just is over the top all the time.  For me, I can't listen to a lot of his singing.  Joe plays a great guitar, and the drums are good.  I will admit, after Glenn's book, he really turns me off anyway.  Lots of ego, \\"the voice\\", but I wish he would tone it down.  And he likes liner notes explaining why each song is so great.  Look Glenn, you haven't done that much in your career - ask Gary Moore (if you could) and Tony Iommi.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I loved this app before it was even conceived - back when I cut and pasted ideas from magazines into comp books.
1427206031|5.0|The combination of Jeffrey Archer's clean, but expressive prose, and Roger Allam's wonderful interpretation was perfect in the recorded version of \\"Paths of Glory.\\"<br /><br />Taken as a piece of fiction, the book had all of the elements that keep you sitting in the driveway listening long after you've arrived home: an engaging storyline, interesting characters driven by important and unique goals, clever antagonists, humor, tragedy, pathos and charm.<br /><br />If you are a person who keeps one book by the bedside and an audio book in the car, don't miss this one! It's one of the best to come along in a great while.
B006MW3UZW|1.0|The video takes forever to load and freezes often. Will never rent again. Netflix is infinitely better. I gave up halfway through the episodes.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Watched on Netflix.  Enjoyed so much, I purchased the DVD.  This movie is very well done.  Loved the characters and the interaction with the bookstore staff.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Received an email from Amazon that the complete series, which normally sells for over $200, was available for under $100.00.  I received it in a week as expected and love being able to see every episode of this great show.  Looking forward to the first snow storm so i can have a WEST WING marathon day!
B007SGM084|2.0|This book did not measure up to all the hype.  Very disappointing.  There should have been more to the story.
0316789798|5.0|If you have anyone who likes to doodle this is the book for you (or them).  My boys, 9 and 6, love these.  Everything is step by step with stuff that kids like to draw.

1417734035|5.0|These books are great for kids, my boys checked them out from school last year and spent a whole week drawing these wonderful pictures, even the 5 year old, you could see the story he was telling in the picture.  They love all of these books. The \\"Make a World\\" one has so many things on each page, it is amazing. Each one drawn out step by step.  I think it really could have everything in it.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|My daugther and I are huge Phantom fans and we were both thrilled with this DVD. Both the stage production, and this DVD were top quality. Highly recommended!!

B0030IIYWA|5.0|Great movie for boys & girls of all ages. Bought it for my daughter & she wants to watch it right after we finished it.. Definitely would recommend to family & friends.
B000062X90|5.0|(1972)  It's all been said before in the last 82 reviews.  The only thing i can say is you don't have too love \\"Argus\\", to be a Wishbone Ash fan.  I've had a love-hate relationship with this album, for 30 years, but mostly love.  You can't go wrong with \\"Time Was\\", the folky \\"Blowing Free\\", a hit  in England, \\"Throw Down The Sword\\", \\"Warrior\\" and \\"No Easy Road\\".  Just great arrangements by the band.  Next up \\"Wishbone Four\\", in 1973.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I have had this app for a while on my kindle fire but it wont download anything anymore after the update. Please Fix!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|In the beginning, I  thought this was  going to be either \\"X\\" or \\"R\\" rated, at the very least, lol! But, as I continued reading, I was hooked on the story-line!  Seriously, I want my husband to read just a couple of pages so, maybe he and I can repeat the magic that Christain and Anastasia found! Once you really get into Book One, you won't be able to stop reading! Enjoy, I Know I Did!  (HaHa!)
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book stops working at the 51%mark on the kindle fire. So far the book is really good but now I am waiting for the problem to be fixed to finish the book. I am hopeful that the amazon team can get all sorted out quickly...
B005H29GSI|2.0|I bought this game for my 5 year old as he loves Angry Birds and it was one of the few toys he specifically requested.  I was concerned by previous reviews about the product but decided that in this case it was worth the risk.<br /><br />It is not very well designed and even my 11 year old daughter got frustrated when trying to play the game according to the rules.  The pieces are very hard to build into the towers and the catapult is hard to aim correctly to knock them down, the bird either sails over the top of the tower or along the ground.<br /><br />However, once we had established this, we abandoned the cards and my son spent a happy hour playing with the pigs and birds and the catapult.  We then built our own towers together with me doing the balancing of the bricks etc.<br /><br />Overall the game is not really worth the money - it is only the beginning of October and after a month the game is abandoned.  The pigs/birds get carried around occasionally but that is all.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved all three books. Couldn't put them down and actually found myself missing them (or him..Christian) when I was finished! lol!
B005LAIHPE|1.0|From the acting to the special effects this movie has no redeeming value. The story has so many problems that you can't find the plot for all the plot holes. Save yourself the lost time and money you'll get from this stinker.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun to play, if you have time to kill this will fill your time and more, entertaining for all age groups
B0098VXE50|5.0|I loved this movie. Yes it was Snow White but it takes it to a different level because it has so much more details and action in it. I would so buy this movie. Would so tell people about it and to watch it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app! I love it more than using it on the computer! keep up the good updates though :)
B008LZHA3G|4.0|This latest offering is very similar and tone to his two previous releases.  I enjoy this direction he is taking us.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I'm not much for fantasy, but this film captured my heart.  Claire Danes is a true star in this film which is all about finding true love.  There is a lot of death in the movie, but much of the gruesomeness is left up to your own mind to define.  I wouldn't recommend it for younger children, but it's a great movie for not-too-sensitive tweens and above.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I read this book in less than two days. I was so excited for it even the librarians who handed it to me seemed excited telling me how many other kids had asked for it but they had to say no because someone else had already laid claim to it. I thought it was amazing and loved it, just like every other Rick Riordan book. The mix of Roman and Greek mythology is perfectly balanced so one doesn't overwhelm the other. And the way the characters are written, they almost feel real, and the enormous differences in their personalities makes it hard to believe they're all thought up and written by one author, those two combined with how they interact with each other can suck you into the story so you actually feel like you're standing on their Greek Trireme living out the scenario or looking through their eyes as an unknown eidolon switching through them as they take turns narrating. The bonding and relationship drama make it so anyone could love this, or any of the other books Riordan has written. I reserved this book at my school library two weeks before it came out and stopped half way through reading the seventh Pendragon book just to read this. All of the new situations and twists placed on the basic storyline that has existed since Percy Jackson and the Olympians: Lightning Thief have made this sequel series even better than the first series (in my opinion). I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted to read something interesting. I definitely can't wait for the next book, next fall. And I'm sure The House of Hades will make me even more excited for the last installment of the series even if I'll be a little sad the series has ended. I sincerely hope Rick Riordan is able to release the next book sooner than next fall while continuing to achieve the same level of writing he has managed so far, but id be willing to wait even longer than just a year to get to read the next amazing book if it meant it would be even better than its predecessors.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Boring... If I wanted to hear Elvis Costello, I'd go buy an Elvis Costello album.  But I'll be glad when the REAL Diana Krall of \\"The Look of Love\\", \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\", \\"Live in Paris\\" comes back.  \\"Diana Krall Does Elvis Costello\\" is not my cup of tea.
0525953728|5.0|Everyone needs to know the truth. This is it. If you wish to cut through all the<br />spin and hearsay, read this book. It connects the dots and provides insight into<br />what really happened as opposed to the crap you get from the main stream media.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book is exciting, enlightening, and liberating. This book is an excellent read. It will take you on a journey and provide insight into your own personal journey.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Simply the best movie of 2012, or perhaps any year for a thinking adult. No need to rely on gimmicks with superb acting and sensational locals.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Great game and a good time sink, but glitches on my phone prevent me from getting certain prizes. Worked great on my Evo.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Nice layout. Stable - no weird crashes. Music is annoying but that's easily solved. Overall a good game and great deal.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|The book provides many insights into the way the human mind works as well as creating awareness of foibles in decision making and development of beliefs.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|...anyone can. By all accounts, I'm pretty fiscally retarded. So much so I'm not even sure that last sentence made sense. Michael Lewis does a great job of explaining the craziness that lead to this amazing event in US history. As a home owner who bought in 2006, it is scary. Our realtor & the banks kept trying to get us into ridiculously priced homes and loans we knew we couldn't possibly repay. This book made me grateful for our foresight, and angry at the  greed that lead to such an unnecessary disaster.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Reflected in you is so much better than Bared to you. It contained alot more suspense and unpredictable moments which kept me interested.<br /><br />To be honest, the first half of the book was a bit too slow and took me a while to get into. But the second half was amazing! Kept me on my toes and i just didn't know what to expect.<br /><br />1%-50% is 4 stars<br />50%+ is a whopping 5 stars!<br /><br />LOVED it and cant wait to read the last installment. I hope it'll be more on the development of Gideon & Eva's relationship!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is best read when the reader has access to one's sexual partner during the reading of the book. Very attention grabbing, very detailed and to the point.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|simply put: kick @$$ album! what a great voice and great music in general. so glad i bought this. please support good music!
B0086QS7N2|4.0|I am a big Rush fan and think this is easily their best effort since Roll The Bones or Counterparts.  It even stands up nicely against some of their finer efforts like Signals, Permanent Waves, etc.  There are a variety of sounds and styles but the overall feel is very much Classic Rock.  Standouts include \\"Headlong Flight\\", \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\", \\"The Garden\\", \\"Halo Effect\\", and \\"The Wreckers\\".  There are very few, if any, throwaway tunes on this album.
B003O86FMW|5.0|THIS WAS MY FAVORITE BOOK EVER!!!! I WILL READ THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. GO TEAM FINNICK!!!!!! IT MADE ME CRY AND LAUGH AND BITE MY NAILS TILL THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO BITE! THIS BOOK WILL BE THE BEST THING YOU'VE EVER READ.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is one of the most useful apps i have, its compatible with all my electronic devices.  When I take notes on my phone and I dont have to worry if my computer crashes, my phone acts up where I loose all my info (Ive had that happen where Ive had to recreate my notes from memory) because of this multi-tasking app I can look up<br />those same notes on my Kindle, on my computer and my phone instantly. Now that i have the new Kindle Fire HD I can use the front facing camera to take pictures if needed, for my project.  If I could give this app 10 stars I woulf
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I think Mocking Jay was an ok addition to the Hungar Games series but it wasn't the best one. You kinda have to read it though in order to full fill your Hungar Games craving, but compare it to Catching Fire or the 1st Hungar Games, it wasn't as action pacted or exiting. I still liked the book but it wasn't my favorite one in the series.
B003N7GATM|4.0|OK, so supposedly this is an effort by Reznor to 'branch out' and try things different than he thought NIN fans would accept.  But the same layered, nuanced, distorted, industrial, dark, nihilistic tones are there, just fronted by somewhat less fiercely screamed but nonetheless somewhat distorted female vocals (his wife)?<br /><br />She must not have near the range or the passion he does, since much of her voice seems to be intentionally processed; that's alright - it seemed to fit the tone of each track, vs. just being 'autotuned' as so many wannabe young divas are.  And she doesn't sing with the anger he has - more like a mix between a bit of lascivious \\"love me long time\\" stereotype pandering or perplexed why-am-I-the-victim tones.<br /><br />None of the above is intended to mean I don't like it - I do.  The 4 stars is mostly because it's so short, only 6 tracks.  Would love to hear more.<br /><br />But frankly, I tend to like virtually everything Herren Reznor and Ross have done...their particular audio landscape manages to hit my nerve endings with a set of impulses like no other.
1423113454|4.0|good lord Rick Riordan has launched himself into some serious magic!  i love love love this new series...I've been a die hard fan of percy jackson but always felt there wasn't enough magic.  This book about Egyptian heroes and channeling their magic is phenomenal...more power more weakness...it's really a fantastic blend of truth, mythology and earth magic.  the attention to detail and symbolism is very on point as well...you really appreciate the dots that connect throughout the story...his writing has come to the caliber of JKRowling in HP5.  i'm impressed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. I could not put it down. This is a fantastic story. A must read for sheer enjoyment. The entire trilogy is wonderful.
B008H6GH8I|4.0|Let's be honest, the Paul Anderson, Mila Jovovich movies make money. They do it because they're ridiculous over the top action movies with violence and gore and a familiar name association. The problem is they enrage fans of the videogame series they're named after because the only similarity they have is in having a bunch of people dressed up as the game characters and occasionally a few familiar iconic enemies show up for no good reason in a story that has gone so far off the rails that it even contradicts itself. To say the live action movies are a huge disappointment to fans of the video games would be an understatement, but they continue to make money because they entertain the common movie goer who has probably only played the first game or knows it has something to do with zombies. The live action movies do nothing to further the cause of videogame movies being taken as seriously as comicbook movies. They arent as horrible as the shlock thate Uwe Boll makes but they're still not helping the validity of videogame movies.<br /><br />The Japanese on the other hand understand what makes the gamer happy in relation to their franchises. Compare any of the Anime versions of things like Tekken, Street Fighter, etc. to their live action counterparts and they feature better action, more emotion and easily more accurate representations of character personalities than the live action movies could ever dream of. Now with the focus moving away from hand drawn animation to near photo realistic CG animation the Japanese animations should be a rival for their pale imitators right? Well almost, but not quite.<br /><br />Resident Evil Damnation, like the first CG movie, lives solidly in the videogame continuity, managing to be a good lead into the new Resident Evil 6 game, much better than the live action and exceeds the previous CG movie in terms of pacing and animation, no small task as the first was well produced feature. Where the first movie was slow to get to the point, this one gets there within the first 10 minutes and rolls into a story that could also have been treated as a Metal Gear Solid movie if you replace the infected people with Cyber enhanced soldiers and the stronger BOWs with Walking tanks. Leon, a hero dedicated to stopping the spread/use of a dangerous weapon, left to fend for himself in a fictional \\"Eastern Slavic\\" nation where two sides fight for control of small provinces trying to break away from the main country. The two sides somehow acquire BOWs (Bio Organic Weapons, created by Umbrella) from the black market and Leon wants to stop them and find out who supplied the weapons. Although unlike Metal Gear Solid, every slow or quiet moment is quickly followed by action so your never left twiddling your thumbs at excessive exposition. There are some humorous moments (Leon is a master of deadpan quips) and some great action scenes throughout, the characters have motivations involving casualties of war and some characters are plotting and manipulating behind the scenes. The one problem if I had to pick on thing that keeps it from being one of the first truly great videogame movies is the writing, written by a Japanese writer and presumably edited or localized into English, which means occasionally eastern sensibilities permeate the edges and can create moments of confusion as to what the motivation of certain characters are at least until they spell it out. The voice acting comes right from the level of the game (which has improved greatly from the horrible origins of the first game). The visuals match the game a bit more this time probably because it's coming out right before it, but with occasionally softer looks, sometimes the mouth movements can be so subtle that you hardly see them speak which I think is intentional as overacting is so easy in CG and motion capture. Don't get me wrong though, there's still plenty of over acting.<br /><br />Is the movie perfect? No, but compared to the live action movies, this islike Capcom's apology for allowing the live action movies to become a parody of the games. If you are a fan of the games you should watch the CG movies and give up on hoping that the live action ones will either go away or get better.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Original cable that came with my 2nd generation Kindle literally fell apart.  Contacted Amazon, they sent a new cable to me at no charge.  Works great, pliable, fits perfectly, no complaints about Amazon service.  No questions or hassle, just a positive response. Very satisfied.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|No complaints from here.  Great packaging, it was plastic sealed and everything worked great.<br />showed up on friday and wasnt scheduled tell monday so i got to watch it in piece while the wife was out at girls night.
159562015X|1.0|I ordered this book as a new book. In order to access the website to take the Strengths Finder assessment there is a one time use code in back of book. It had been used prior to my receiving the book. What a rip off!!!!!!! What a waste......
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Bought it while on business trip and it was a good read. I would rather have it in paper form though.  Easier on the eyes.  (I read it on my ipad.
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|I have 3 kids reading this book on different devices (kindle fire, google nexus and kindle fire hd).  Crashes on all of them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is addictive. it is not very challenging at first but it sucked me in as I advanced through the levels. now I cant get enough of it.
B007SGM084|5.0|One heck of a book to keep your interest going. This was a hard one to put down. Had to read all 3 books to curtail my interest.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|After reading the entirety of this book I came away with mixed feelings. So parts seemed worth doing, like the website, blog and links to kindle etc, but others seemed seemed downright underhanded. Then when I discovered locke actually achieved his goal by buying reviews rather than earning them, that was the nail in the coffin. If you're into being dooped, by all means buy this book, but if you're a honest and hard working writer just keep at it and hold onto the fact that you're not a cheat.
B007M45PMU|5.0|\\"Ho Hey,\\" got me hooked, but the rest of the album is good, as well! There's only one or two songs I skip on ocassion.
0061969664|5.0|Cornwell never disappoints! Every book of the Saxon Tales series has been outstanding! Death of Kings follows suit. Uhtred is ever the Viking warrior who follows a Christian king
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|We hsve always enjoyed this movie and now we have it on DVD.  We are looking forward to seeing the \\"extras.\\"
1401322786|5.0|We have read all of Mitch Alboms books and this is another awesome read. He never lets his readers down.<br />I recommend this book to everyone who likes to read. You will not view time in the same way after reading this.<br />Koodles to Mitch.
0446585025|1.0|I am a fan of Ellen but this book was well.. boring. There were maybe a few things that were a little funny but not enough to pay for this book at all. I wish I had not bought it now and will probably stick watching her on TV instead of reading her books.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Although I love my bose earbuds, I didn't like the wire always getting in the way while working out. Decided to go wireless and this little gadget does the trick.  It works great on my iPod nano, but does wear the battery down significantly. I like that it's tiny enough it doesn't get in my wrists way, as I have a band for the nano.  I use this only for my iPod. I really like it!!
0061719544|5.0|I have LOVE this man for years and think he is hilarious and this book was no exception! When I seen this book I just knew I had to read it and I am so happy I did. I was laughing so much though most if and the only times I wasn't was when he was talking about something series. I have so much more respect for him now after reading this and hearing his story.<br />If you don't know who Craig Ferguson even is I would recommend picking this up anyway because you don't have to know anything about him to find this a fantastic read!
B008HK3QII|5.0|When I first got the Fire, I bought a folio case, thinking I'd only be using it to read books, and that a folder which opens like a book would be a good way to carry it in my larger bag.  However, I've found that I use the Fire a lot for streaming video, and standing it up in the folio I purchased is impossible.  Also, it isn't protected adequately when I shove it in my bag (or put other items in afterward).<br />I've been very happy with the sturdy construction of the Timbuk2 backpacks and messenger bags which I already own, and this case, which holds the Fire perfectly, is no exception.<br />I am happy with the case and would get a similar one for any other tablet I end up owning.
1594484805|5.0|This is an important book that provides a very different perspective on the topic of human motivation.  Very relevant to business leaders, parents and teachers.  The work presented is well researched, and the conclusions are presented in an simple and memorable framework.  Dan Pink is one of the most important thinkers of our day.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am extremely satisfied with this bag. It is roomy for all of my photo accesories, including lenses, batteries, cables, manual, flashes etc. Confortable when transported and most important... keeps everything handy and well secured always. A real bargain considering the relation price/quality.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very easy to use and does exactly what it is supposed to do. Those being the most important qualifications for an app, Calculator Plus gets five stars!
B00005JMAH|5.0|the dvd was as described and arrived on or before expected date. I am very satisfied with this purchase. And it works like a charm.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i have been using this game for some time and i must say experience on kindle fire HD is as great as ever... :-)
B008C1O8CA|4.0|So I've been playing Uno in the car this week, and that has been about the right place to play it, since it is almost entirely a power-pop album. Imagine an entire album at about the tone of the song \\"Know Your Enemy\\" from the previous release, and you're getting close to Uno. More than that, Uno also sounds like it might have been the follow-up to the more pop-like Warning album. It definitely sounds professionally, perfectly produced. The slick production is a big part of what transforms it from a punk to a pop album. Having said all that, it doesn't have the weight of previous albums and feels incomplete. This is probably because in a sense it really is incomplete being the first of three releases in a short duration of time, but I'm hoping for more range out of the next two releases. I give Uno an overall thumbs up, but it just doesn't stand on its own like practically every other Green Day release. If nothing else, it is very good high energy power-pop, ready-made for blasting out while heading down the highway.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|i must say creativity goes a long way and the developers of this game have done that!  although looks simple initially but can quickly make you an addict :-)  nice graphics and sounds..
B005OJTVAW|5.0|Great cover for kindle fire good  color shrimp fits in purse and isnt bulky also previously had black zip cover I put it down and forgot it  luckily a honest person returned it to me
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Does excellent job protecting my Kindle Fire.  Is exactly as represented. The cover can withstand the frequent usage I give it and is easily wiped clean, if needed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I LOVED Bared to You -- it was easy read and I could not put it down -- I read it twice that is how much I loved it....  I could not wait for the second book in the trilogy to come out.<br /><br />I love Eva she is so confident and strong even though she is so messed-up inside! and of course LOVE sexy....masculine...HOT....Gideon.<br /><br />In Reflected in You -- I though Eva came out like a whinny.....school girl. What happened to her strength and confident from the first book.  I was confused, everything was so fast -I got whiplash (SERIOUSLY) -it was like they had dated for months from the end of the first book to the beginning of the second book. There are a lot of un-answered questions, which left me hanging.<br /><br />I am hoping that the third and final book will answer all those questions. (i.e. why was there lipstick on his shirt cuff...why did he take a shower if he had taken one already! Did Corinne surprised him by kissing him and that is why the sofa had been moved and what about the cushion on the floor)-it was never explained. Also, when did Nathan started coming around to blackmail Gideon or Eva's step-father and why didn't the stepdad do anything to protect her.<br /><br />I had to read the book again- read the ending the pages where Detective Graves tells Eva her speculations- so I could make a timeline and understand the rest of the book-that is how confused I was.<br /><br />I still LOVE the the Novel. I am just hopping that the 3rd book will answer some the questions that were left hanging, and I mean there were a few!!
1416550542|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and have recommended it to others who have read it and loved it too. The story will keep you in suspence until the very end. Each character is important to the story line in their own way and add so much to the plot.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good novel to read.
B009329Y30|4.0|Sorry! I never got a chance to finish it, but I heard it was a good movie. I will rent it again.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|The movies came in great timing and this one was amazing. Story line, acting everything about it was great. Definitely would recommend.
B009LZDGSI|5.0|I enjoyed being able to not worry too much about my children watching this, emphasis is put on deductive reasoning and not just the blood and gore of murders or crime. Great cast, hope they start showing more of Aiden Quinn.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|Great idea and decent built, this is what the stock lens cap should have been, though Olympus choose to make some extra bucks releasing this after<br />I think it is a little pricey for what it is though, but I don't think you can find it cheaper anywhere, I bought it from Amazon because of the benefit of PRIME, there's a couple of other sites including the Olympus website for the same prize + Shipping.
B0064W67IM|4.0|This was a relatively good read. I feel like the individual stories were a little short but knowing that this was a monthly release it makes sense. The stories are certainly to the point and when collected together in this manner does make for an entertaining  and comprehensive read. I'm definitely going to buy the second volume because with the introduction of Death at the end of this one it looks like the plot will thicken and have more substance as it continues. I would recommend to any fan of somewhat darker material any really any comics fan in general.
0525953728|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read! It is truly a great \\"see through the eyes of the author\\" Biography. My thanks to the guys of Team 6 and all that continue to serve to this day. You deserve the highest honor!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|In the 80's, I was reintroduced to comics by reading the Dark Knight Returns and the Killing Joke books. I was instantly hooked on the Batman again. The darker tone captivated me, as the writing was not kiddie stuff, but good enough for grownups to read and contemplate.<br />This movie follows the graphic novel faithfully; very minor deviations.<br />I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the Dark Knight Return books years ago, and to anyone who likes the current Dark Knight movies. I hope the follow up is as good as the first.<br />Hey DC, how about a Killing Joke movie? Guess that might have to be rated \\"R\\", huh?
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My granddaughter loves this app. Especially now that she is addicted to Doc McStuffins..being a doctor to her patients in this app is a lot of fun. The child has to bring the patient to a bed in the hospital. She discovered by mistake that the beds can be changed...lights turned on/off...trashs cleaned...which I use as a tool to tell her that patients dont want to be in a dirty room....The only medical treatment that she struggles with is the one that the magnet has to be lowered and raised...She cant figure out how to do that one and will either bring the Nabi 2 to me...or just quit the game at that point. Otherwise...all of the other medical treatments she has to do ..she loves....Also she likes to have the helicopter take off from the roof of the hospital.  Oh and dont miss the Panda's medical kit on the first floor...
B0036EH3UC|4.0|I am still working my way through the seasons and I have to say that this is such an engaging show.  Even if you are not a sci- fi fan you will like this program.  I believe this is more about religion and politics than it is space.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is because season 2, disc1, episode 1 will not play.  It freezes up for some reason, all other episodes on that disc play  like they are supposed to.  I hope that will be the only episode that has that problem, otherwise 5 stars all around!!!!!!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|Very cute game for a younger child for cooking....the customer is dropped off on the main floor and then the child has to place the customer into one of the chairs upstairs...a bubble will appear to show what their order is....the child will have to stir pots, chop veggies, pour food into blenders, peel fruit , bake pies and other fun things....My granddaughter is 2 and 1/2 and really enjoys this game. Other than cooking...the child will have to occasionally sort trash into the recycling bin....clean and set the tables...remove the spider in one of the rooms...
0316228532|4.0|This dark but engaging novel has one thing (at least) in common with the Harry Potter books: it deals at length with the disconnect between the actual lives of teenagers and how those teenagers are seen by their parents. The teens in the village of Pagford are not magical, but they do have a power their parents don't recognize: they are comfortable with computers. One after another, they hack into the parish council website to wreak havoc with their parents' lives and reputations.<br /><br />Ms Rowling is an astute observer of the lives of teens, whom she depicts with sympathy and depth. The lives of her adult characters are interesting but somewhat less deeply examined. She does a wonderful job, though, of presenting from everyone's perspective the life of the man whose sudden death at the beginning of the novel precipitates the action.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading The Casual Vacancy. It was long but well-paced, looping through its largish cast of characters and perspectives with confidence and clarity. The chapters, scenes, and sentences were well-constructed, with some beautiful descriptions. Rowling used some dialect to indicate class distinctions but no regional expressions or pronunciations that would indicate where in England the story takes place. (At least, the reader was not tripping over \\"innit\\" all the time, as in some English books.)<br /><br />Rowling's take on the human condition is, on the whole, more compassionate than caustic, but she does not seem hopeful that the enormous burden of class disparity is going to lift from English society any time soon. One of her teenage characters is preoccupied with the idea of living an \\"authentic\\" life. The way people define themselves, and how that definition affects their actions, is at the core of this thoughtful, funny, and affecting book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun game to play. wish that it went a little bit faster than it does. just want to keep stopping coins
B005ZUR724|5.0|I love it!  great questing great graphics.  I spent hours here recovering from injuries.  I am an avid WOW player and still play even tho now recovered
B005LLT0DQ|5.0|The best show ever. Period! I was a big sopranos fan and I wasn't interested in a show about a motorcycle gang. After the first episode I was hooked! Now I'm buying a harley and riding free!
B007P6VM04|5.0|all the music of smash is fantastic. i wish they would have included more of the original songs written for the show.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Enjoyable movie that you can't help but watch over and over again! This is a great Disney movie that will become a classic!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed the first book, but I really think that this book was all around better. Only bad thing is now I have to wait until December until the 3rd book comes out.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I enjoyed this game even though you need to purchase bombs to get past a couple of the levels.  still worth it.
B008NEVPCC|1.0|Cher Lloyd is a rapper....sorta. The problem is that her music is not very original, nor exciting at all. She also tries to sound powerful (check out the constant \\"HUNH!!!\\" on the opening track), but her voice is simply limp and lame.<br /><br />Similar singers who easily best this mess, and who I recommend rather than Cher: Pink, Katy Perry, Alanis Morrissette, Avril Lavigne, even Jessie J....the list goes on and on.<br /><br />The production is also pretty standard & pedestrian, with nothing new to offer.<br /><br />Avoid this junk CD, and buy something else by someone that REALLY kicks some ass.<br /><br />In the end, Cher Llloyd is just a wanna-be....or, maybe....a never-was!
B00005QCYC|5.0|Great set and nice to have all three, kids love it,  was shipped quickly and delievered exactly as described .. very happy w/ this vendor
B0087HT36U|5.0|I only have short bursts of time for game play and this one is particularly fun and intriguing. A couple of minor graphics glitches from time to time don't bother me especially when the game is so engaging and fun to play.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app because it tells me how much time I have left on kindle. I'm always going on it and changing. the culor. my ants even love it! Im thinking about geting the pro veshon!

B008MZPUXW|3.0|been following Neil's work since the 90's<br />I bought this CD without listening to the samples<br />because I know that everything he does is wonderful<br /><br />this record sounds to me like he's been hanging around Jack Johnson too much..<br />it's far too soft and pretty for me<br />and even though Neil's records are very mellow<br />they always have had a bite to them<br />that keeps them from drifting into inane sweetness<br /><br />with the exception of \\"Tied to You\\"<br />this album belongs in either a nursery<br />or a nursing home<br /><br />I respect his creative decisions<br />but if this is the direction his solo work is headed,<br />I'm thankful for his extensive back catalog.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love Ken Follett and this doesn't disappoint. Can't wait for the third book! Follett makes this time period come alive. I don't usually enjoy historical fiction from this era, however, this was particularly poignant and I could hardly put it down.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Downloaded and played. It's awesome!<br />Played before on iphone/ipad versions.<br />I have to say on Kindle Fire this took a little to get used to. The screen feels a little too slippery and not as refine. But that's not the birds fault :)
B000NY17J6|4.0|The sound is very good and as always with greatest hits compilations there is going to be someone dissappointed with a song not being on there that they think should be. I am also guilty of this and think it is a shame that the George Lowell standard \\"Willin'\\" from the \\"Heart Like a Wheel\\" album definitely should be on here. Again it is hard to get everything great an artist like Ronstadt has done on even two greatest hits albums. And of course I could think of many more.
0525953728|5.0|This book is a must read if you're interested to learn about some of the inner workings,of the most elite Special Operations Forces in the world. You will read about the most dedicated people in the U.S. who finally brought justice to one of the most ruthless terrorists the world will ever know.
B004GF87VE|5.0|This books make you feel as if the world can be a kinder place.  if u have a love for animals and just a nice story this is it
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was a little put off by the first book Bared but having read it I needed to see how the story continued. Reflected is so much better than Bared! I was finally able to actually fall in love with Gideon. I didn't think much of him in Bared and thought he came across as weird, not the cool rich dominant he was supposed to be. Reflected changed ALL that, especially after the Brett incident! Reflected was so much more engaging. Having said all that I feel like both books are way too short, at just a little over 300 pages each. I feel like they should have been combined into one really good book. It would have felt a lot more satisfying and I could have given it a 5 star review. People who are now just picking up on this series will at least have the opportunity to read them back to back. Looking forward to Entwined!

B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book was interesting enough but not really very dark.  I think it reads more like a romance novel and I was expecting it to be a little more shocking.
0525953728|5.0|I have never posted a review on a book before but after reading this one I must.<br /><br />I've read many, many similar books on team guys.  With the bad press and reviews before the book was even available I didn't jump at first but then after seeing the positive reviews pile up I jumped in.  I was hooked from the start.  Here are a few things I liked:<br /><br />- This book doesn't start at BUD/S and go on how hard it is.  We know that.  We read the Warrior Elite.  It spends a little time in Green Team which was nice because little has been written about Green Team.<br /><br />- I realize it was ghost written for him but the central figure is not arrogant.  He comes across as human.  Many times he states his own personal limitations.<br /><br />- The writing was strong.  While relaying real world events it flowed extremely well.  It made the book pleasurable to read while being informative.<br /><br />Criticisms were about giving out information that could hurt operational security on future missions.  I have no idea if it did that or not.  But I can say I am very happy to know men like this exist and have done, and continue to do, the things that keep us safe.<br /><br />This, Fearless, and Lone Survivor are my favorites.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Even though I enjoyed fifty shades trilogy bared to you and reflected in you are so much better I can't wait to see what is next great series!
B004XKXGTA|5.0|Free is good. This had a lot of extra data and behind the scenes stuff. My hubby and I have enjoyed watching it together. Has some funny bits.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|I know Hollywood is starved for originality, but mining old TV series isn't working and they can't figure it out. In the same vein as A Team, Starsky/Hutch, Dark Shadows disappoints. It failed to capture the macabre, creepy, campy feel of the TV show. I normally love the Depp/Burton collaborations, but this one fell short. I don't recommend buying it. Maybe as a rental if youre tired of watching Avnegers, but otherwise skip it.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Good product, I was suprised at the sound when I first put them on. They sounded good. I thought the sound was very natural like I was not wearing them.I walked away from my computer and was happy to hear no distortion. I did not go far but I liked the fact I could walk away.<br /><br /> The Feel on the head and in the hand is strange. I mean the are comfortable on the ears for hours and they feel well made in the hand. Then theres the feeling of flimsy contruction at the same time. I mean they are well made but because of the design which alows them to move in mutiple points makes it feel less sturdy than it is. I guess I mean it will fool you in thinking it might not be as well made as it is.<br /><br /> I Have the plantronics most expensive head phones a love them. They are awsome for the sound. I purchased the Logitechs for mobility. I am always loseing headphone from eiter rolling over the chord one to many times or snaping the cable because I forggot about the chord. The chord in genral gets in my way constanly having that fredom was worth the extra I paid to replace my perfecty goods ones before I destroyed them.<br /><br />The software was eay and siple and clean looking. Should have no problems there and as always DL the lates toss the CDs in packages.<br /><br /> This is my 1st week owning them been toying around for at least a year to get them finaly did woth buying. I will update if any thing changes.<br /><br />Only 4 for now will see if anything changes might go to 5 stars
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought this book was a waste of good money.  I do not object to a book for mature audiences if it is well written and tastefully done.  I admit that I didn't finish the book.  I had more than enough after 3 or 4 chapters.  I believe this book is more fitting for a strictly porn shop.  If kinky is what you are looking for, this book will fit the bill perfectly.  I was really disappointed.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|It was awsome The best B movie goodness.<br /><br /> Having said that keep in mind I am rating this in the B movier cat so keep an open mind. For a regualar main stream movie it would be bad not horible but bad.<br /><br /> Now then, the movie was awsome great sory line (For B Movie) and special effect were good, Acting was suprisingly well. I could not tell they were trying to act like most b movies which means they hired actual actors. Some were main stream actors who you will recognize right away. The weakest link in the whole move was the black guy, sorry dont know his name or anyone elses for that matter. He was the only one who remided you this was B movie acting.Other wise the plot and syle of the movie would be the only thing letting you know it was a B movie.<br /><br /> It had the fell of Attack of Mars, very entertaining. My main thought when watching this was why did it not have its do in theaters.<br /><br />Pleasure to watch.*** For what it is it exeled***
0307346617|1.0|Given the book's popularity I was expecting something really exciting and engaging. I quickly grew tired of the interviews that always stopped just at the point when they could have gotten interesting. Perhaps if I'd gone into it with lower expectations...    But then again, I think Zone One by Colson Whitehead is spectacular, and its overall rank on amazon is 3 stars, so I guess I'm at odds with the current here.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|1St I dont not know how this is getting anything less than 5 stars. They buyers must not have been true fans. I glad it was made in the first place. A 70 cartoon with not a gigantic fan base transformed to the silver screen.<br /><br />I was very afraid this might ruin my child hood memories of the cartoon. I turned it on expecting the worse and this is what I got.<br /><br />Great acting for what was low budget. The special effect I thought were good. It was upo to par with the new version of battlestar galactica whith better acting.<br /><br />If you liked the cartoon then you will love the Human rendistion. I wnat them to make all the other ones now. I would like to see them on kick started to get a budget to follow up thats how much I think fans will enjoy this.

B00480OHWK|4.0|Great book for children!  I read this book to my nephew and he loved it! He made me read it over and over.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have not read through the entire book one, but I'm not really trying to write a plot synopsis anyway, so here goes my experience so far with reading this book.<br /><br />I would probably tag it as under my \\"guilty pleasure\\" category. To aptly describe it, Fifty Shades is the adult version of Twilight. It is a very easy read (after reading the GoT books, I had to take some time off with the heavy dialogue and plot twists), simply written, bordering on the amateurish, but the simplicity of the story was refreshing.<br /><br />I could see where people come from when they wrote the previous reviews. Sure, there was a significant amount of usage of the term \\"subconscious\\" (a.k.a. inner goddess), and more than your share of gasping, and blushing -- I swear the main lady character Ana has managed to turn 50 shades of red by the time you reach the middle of the book, they should've renamed the book title. I pull a smirk whenever the \\"inner goddess\\" reference is mentioned in each chapter, all the while remembering the people who have commented about it here. I mean, come on -- easy on the subconscious references!<br /><br />I have to smile though, because in my opinion, I did not think it was a horrible book. It may not compare to Anne Rice's (AN Roquelaure) hardcore erotica books (which chafed my imagination raw), but we have to admit we (I have to say, most women?) all have the same conversations with our subconscious \\"inner goddess\\" in us. At least I do -- maybe that's what makes me relatable to the character. I don't call her \\"inner goddess\\", though (because I am THE goddess). OK -- smugness aside...<br /><br />The only thing I have to say to those yet thinking of picking up the book is not to set the initial expectations so high. This book appeals to most and is very successful because it's of its freshness and mundanity. It provides an easy-to-read depiction of what an S&M relationship is all about to the curious, that it's just more than just a form of perversion, that some people use it to get in touch with their sexuality. It's like S&M 101-- then you can move on to \\"heavier\\" erotica, if you are still interested. It's not Tolstoy or Tolkien-esque, but hey -- it wasn't intentionally meant to be voted for a Pulitzer Prize. The writing style is not appalling -- I've read worse. To those with vivid imagination, it still has enough elements to leave you \\"hot and bothered\\" [oh my!]<br /><br />And I'm just easy to please. I have all three -- I WILL read them. And, maybe, get a hard copy to add to my physical \\"guilty pleasure\\" bookshelf.that some people use it to get in touch with their sexuality.

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I love this game but it seems that jetpack joyride on an apple product for example an IPad get more items in the stash and get different areas. What is the cause for this?
0061692042|4.0|This book holds few surprises; the biggest plot twists are revealed at the very beginning.  As Dell, the protagonist of this novel, reveals his life story over the course of the book, one cannot help but become increasingly engrossed, both with him and with the landscape of the country around him.  Is Ford rejecting America's smug self-contentedness and its ability to get itself into a pickle without much consideration aforethought, or is he embracing Canada for all its foibles?  Not sure; but I rank this one up there with Independence Day.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked the first book a lot and cant wait to read the third book.  These have never been a fan of these books but after reading  The Fifty Shades of Grey novels i was hooked!:)
1423140605|5.0|This book is the best one in The Heroes of Olympus so far. The cliffhanger at the end was horrible-I can't wait for the next one!<br />It was very funny, although since they're all older, he adds in too much romance for my taste. It was a great read and I encourage anyone who wants to to read The Mark of Athena.
1451673442|5.0|I loved this book.  Even if you're not a big fan of the secret, I think this is a good book for anyone to read.  It's all about gratitude, and I think we can all use a reality check on that now & then.  There are a lot of great exercises to get you into the mindset of giving thanks every day.  I have re-read it numerous times to refresh myself on these great habits.  I can read a book and think I need to remember to do something, but having exercises to do each day gives a way to put that into action.  I could feel my spirits lifting and my outlook brightening.  Maybe reading it at the gym with my endorphins going helped with that!  There are good examples of how to put these practices into action, viewing people and situations in a different light.  Feeling gratitude and adjusting my view have really led to some great outcomes for me.  I have put many of the tools into action, and it really has made a difference in my life.
0375507256|4.0|Rather than re-cap what others have said, I will add a new insight.  This book required full attention while reading.  I found the post-Fall center section the most difficult because of the dialect.  I had to slow down and mentally \\"speak\\" the words and sentences in my mind.  The dialect is very lyrical and there was unique reading pleasure associated with this part of the book. This is a book that is NOT a quick read but the rewards are worth the time invested.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I did not want to put this book down. I lost a lot of sleep due to not being able to put this book down!!
B007SGM084|4.0|I dont know if anyone else noticed this, but its actually cheaper to buy each indvidual book than the whole trilogy. Fail for the publishers who charge 30.00!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Two things---listen to the bass and you'll fall into a groove so deep and wide you'll not get out 'till the music stops. \\"Pagan Heart\\" is a stunner--resurrects John Lee Hooker almost in the flesh---and the electric guitar playing is the most uncanny facsimile of Hooker's own it's absolutely clairvoyant. The song conjurs up other ghosts as well, as most of Van's songs do. Van is one of the very few artists still alive and active who remind me of why I fell in love with this music all these years ago-\\"and it's too late to stop now\\".

B008NW67E0|5.0|Good strong second effort.<br />Poignant lyrics and well produced.<br />I have an ultra high end system and it's very unkind to poor recordings.<br />No complaints with this recording!
B000FBJHT4|4.0|All of your suspicions of government cover-ups and secret developments are described in pretty good detail.  This book is an easy read that weaves together the known history with the first-hand experiences and hear-say of a credible Colonel Corso to describe the technological development of some of the world's greatest advances.

0525952926|4.0|Through masterful storytelling and attention to detail, Ken Follett's historical novels bring the past to life.  This book, the second book of his Century Trilogy, is no exception.  A history of the causes and events of World War II, it takes place from approximately 1920-1949 in Germany, England, Russia, and the United States.  He describes the Spanish Civil War through the eyes of the foreign volunteers.  Although this book portrays the most important theater of World War II, it describes only one part of the war.  There is only a brief mention of Germain occupation of Scandinavia.  No mention is made of the German occupation of France, Belgium, and Holland.  Nor is the Italian experience mentioned.  The fight with Japan in the Pacific is only briefly described.  The war in China, and Southeast Asia is not depicted.  Nor does this book portray the war in North Africa and the Middle East.<br /><br />Most books about World War II in Europe focus on the Jewish experience.  The Holocaust is barely mentioned in this book.  Follett focuses on the experience of non-Jewish civilians - especially the opponents of Fascism and, to a lesser extent, Communism.  When I thought about it, I realized this tale also needs to be told.  I was a child during World War II and have always remembered newsreels depicting post war Germany and the liberation of the concentration camps.  Both were horrifying.<br /><br />As I now realize, the Holocaust was much more horrifying than post war Germany, which is why so many have told stories about it.  But people should also be reminded of the experience of Germans who either did not believe in Fascism or who were naively seduced by it.  Through vignettes about characters in Germany, England, Russia, and the U.S., Follett vividly describes the German and Russian descent into this horror and the pain and suffering of the British.  The American role is less central to the story.  But America's ties to England and Europe become clear.<br /><br />Totalitarianism and war is horrific.  I have no doubt that people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Cambodia, Burma, and Vietnam can understand and sympathize with Follett's story.  Follett dares to show that war is terrible.  For example, he makes war seem realistic by letting important characters in his story die and/or suffer.<br /><br />Follett's weak point, in my opinion, is descriptive characterization.  I award four stars because of this.  This problem is particularly evident at the beginning of the book when he introduces the main characters.  All seem like collections of trite ideas rather than people.  Since there are many characters to introduce, I almost put down the book.  I am glad I didn't.  Follett describes characters better through their actions.  Subsequent actions gradually imbued most of the characters with some complexity.<br /><br />Follett is a master of storyteller.  The tension he imbues in his plots keeps the reader glued to this long book.  If you are the kind of person who just keeps reading when the going gets riveting  - beware!  Few people could finish this book by reading all night.<br /><br />If you are interested in history, I recommend this book.
B000005ALN|5.0|This is it. This is George's Masterpiece. The layout, the production, the lyrics, the raw emotion all make this one of the best records of all time. Not only does this record transcend genres, it also transcends time. Older is a timeless record that speaks from the heart about discovery of ones self, the loss of love and the realization of 'how life goes'. Peppered with a couple of upbeat tracks, the over all tone of the album is heartfelt and a bit serious, kind of how life feels when you realize you are indeed, getting 'older'.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've never read anything like it. Do you want to remember youth? Such an unexpected jolt to the imagination too.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this App, it's quick and simple to use. I even use it for and to balance my check book.
B007DA2FHG|4.0|What a great movie!!! How they tough that horse to do so many fascinating things.....I struggle just getting my horse to stand still so that I can brush its  tail! A must see for anyone really! My 11 year old daughter loved the movie too she has it on her kindle fire, I have it on my iPad still have another download available on this movie to one other device, all for 14.99 such a great deal!!!!
B000VJAICK|3.0|Oh Tremors how I adore you. Why can't all movies just be fun? I bought this because I still utilize my HDDVD player and thought this would be a great addition. Visually I can say that it is certainly High Def and looks really good. I don't think much care went into cleaning it up but overall it didn't need it. There are a few places that look a little pixelated but nothing that ruins the viewing experience. Sound is excellent but still suffers from really quite talking versus the really loud movie music but that's not the fault of the disc. I certainly recommend this to anyone that hasn't seen it but enjoys silly monster movies.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This amazing book kept me on the edge if my seat. Suzanne Collins is an incredible author!  this book really is admiring.
6305692572|5.0|Received quickly in good packaging.  New, love the movie anyway so it all worked out well and could not beat the price.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love it. it keeps my place. easy to read. easy to follow.  best reviews. wish I had more time to read it,
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|I love Liam Neeson's movies he was great in this one. First off he's like a 6 ft dude who knows about rouge wolves thats pretty cool, Second great acting from him and the supporting cast really it just keeps your face glued to the screen the whole time!!. Third it's weird that the wolves stalk them the whole time but awesome to. Finally got a movie were you just keep guessing (What's gonna happen next or ooooooo that wolve is gonna get him). I really liked him in \:[[ASIN:B001TODCII Taken (Single-Disc Extended Edition)]] & [[ASIN:B004A8ZX28 Unknown]]. Also don't wanna spoil the last part but it was great i don't know why all these 1 star people are hatin on this it's so good, sick & bad. I would give it 7 but you cant.
