B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I always enjoy a good Penderast novel. Preston & Child write a good little si fi type of book. I think The Relic was my favorite.
0451205766|3.0|First, I haven't seen either Godfather movie. I got the book from the library and began reading it and was intrigued enough to continue.<br /><br />I know I am going against the grain when I say this, but The Godfather really IS a mediocre work of fiction. Sorry to all the fans, but that's how I see it and that is, again, never having seen the movies. The characterizations are adequate but certainly not earth-shattering. Puzo keeps the reader at a distance by doing a lot of head-jumping (as one other reviewer noted). He also creates over-wrought dialogue that often sounds forced and unnatural.<br /><br />The book is engaging for sure. But it's also extremely misogynistic, violent, and over-all a shallow view of iconic characters. My review might seem very muddy, but well... the book is pretty muddy too. It has flashes of brilliance amid a whole lot of meh.
1475143389|5.0|Founded on sound research, intelligent, articulate, simple, and just plain common sense.  This book makes it its mission to cut through all of the fitness BS that's out there and just spells out exactly what hypertrophy is and how your body REALLY responds to diet and exercise.  Mike Mathews is one of my new favorite authors. I highly recommend this book and any other books he's written.  Also, the audible audio version is very well done.  Great for the commuter.<br /><br />Long enough to provide detailed information. Short enough to keep out the fluff. A+
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Unexpected and switching plot, great writing, after a while impossible to put down. A different kind of genre: crime meets marriage counseling. If you like twisted and morbid stories, and /or is interested in the dynamics of a relationship, you will like this one.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Personally, I love the country/folk sound. It's different and it's great. The only bad thing about this album is the fact that its really only 10 songs long. Beautiful.
B0089LOG02|5.0|We decided to read this book for my book club.  It was a joy from the beginning. Quick read.  Really enjoyed both women's stories.  Recommend it highly.
B00785P2QC|4.0|the animation is good the moneys good the buildings are good its all a bunch of good stuff lol all around it was pretty damn good.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fast paced and nifty. Enjoy playing it with all the kids watching over my shoulder. They're just jealous of my mad skills.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game! It's so much fun. It's even funner than Subway Surfer. I like that you can go to different scenes. I also like the mini games it has. The power ups are cool too. It's really fun but a bit challenging at times if you go a certain time without dying because it gets faster. Very fun!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Interesting story, a little disjointed from time to time though. Overall another great book from Khaled Hosseini, very talented author.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|I found this disappointing - It wasn't what I expected. Someone who is new to the area of law of attraction may find it helpful but i was looking for a deeper undertsanding
0307352153|5.0|If you are an introvert or some derivative thereof (I'm not sure how you can know what flavor of &#34;introvert&#34; you are without reading a book on it), you will get a lot out of this book.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I really love the stories and all the twist and turns. I will keep reading the series for sure and recommend it to others.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Oh my gosh! I love this game so much! Its an awesome time killer and its so fun to play! Basically all you have to do is to control your little vehicle collect coins and don't run out of gas by collecting the gas cans. Awesome game overall!!!!
B005LAII80|5.0|Karl Urban is fantastic as Judge Dredd. Why does he wear a helmet the entire movie? Because with an arse like that in 3D, there is nothing left that needs to be seen. Have a 3D setup? This is a great movie to enjoy again and again.
0385523394|4.0|I bought the book after devouring the tv series. While not as sexy as the show, I thought the book was a highly entertaining, informative read.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I'm going to comment on the series as a whole, given the nature of the story, making this by far my longest Amazon review to date. No spoilers for the climax, and only minimal spoilers for the series.<br /><br />First, some of the mechanics.<br /><br />I read the novels in the 90s, at first, until I ground to a halt around books 6-8, as so many did. On this go around, I listened to the first 13 as audiobooks, mostly in the car or at the gym. This was, as you'd expect, a long-term project, begun near the end of 2009. The audio version had two readers, Michael Kramer and Kate Reading, for the male and female perspective characters, and they stuck with it for all 14 volumes (somewhere over 300 CDs). They were excellent, especially Kramer at the beginning, but I came to appreciate Reading more over time. My only real quibble is that I wish they'd coordinated on the pronunciation of the fantasy names. In any event, due to changes in my circumstance, I read most of AMoL as written word -- which got me through a lot faster.<br /><br />Another mechanics note is to applaud Brandon Sanderson's work. It was no easy task that he took on, regardless of how extensive the written segments and notes were that Jordan left. And the transition was nearly seamless, a rarity in my experience of such things. The man did his homework.<br /><br />Now to the story and writing. Jordan was notorious for certain writing tics, such as mentioning at least three physical characteristics of each character encountered, no matter how minor the role. Admittedly, in some ways, this helped with keeping track of the cast of thousands. And throughout the series, the women kept sniffing, all perspective characters had disparaging internal narratives about the opposite sex, Lan's face was all hard planes and angles, etc. Perhaps especially in audio, it got a little old. But there's something to be said for consistency. The only really jarring character-breaking I can think of was in the awkward transitionat the end of book 3, presumably when the contract extended to the much longer series.<br /><br />Also something I may have noticed more in audio, because there is no skimming, the segments from the perspectives of the characters with zilch for self-awareness (I'm looking at you, Nynaeve) got a bit painful.<br /><br />And for the good: Jordan was a master at tracking. I'm thinking specifically he always considered what any given character at a given time knew or believed about the other characters or world events. This gave the reader omniscience that no character had, even aside from certain beliefs based on genre conventions (I'm looking at you, dead Moraine). It's a tricky line to walk, especially with scores of perspective characters, but he did a marvelous job.<br /><br />More than that, I found on the second go-through that certain themes, mostly about the nature of stories, were woven throughout the series. Very meta at times! But there was more than one message in the massive verbiage. I also found elements I appreciated more as a more mature reader, such as the differences in the literary roles for Mat, Perrin, and Rand.<br /><br />As far as AMoL specifically? First, the bloody (pick your meaning) 193-page chapter entitled \\"The Last Battle\\" was tough going. It was obviously a key part of the story, but it felt like every surviving perspective character from the previous 13 characters had to get at least one scene. In put me in mind of a college coach bringing the seniors off the bench in an already-decided game.<br /><br />And non-spoiling about the climax: He (I should say they) deftly dodged some of the pat, cliched resolutions available to them. Not that there were no cliches -- the nature of this story, even with talented authors, demands some -- but they were not pat. I can't say for sure that I found it completely satisfactory relative to the immense effort, sometimes a slog, to get to the end, but I'm not sure such a balance would have been possible.<br /><br />All in all, the series gets a solid 4/5, which is at least 1 higher than I would have rated the half-story I gave up on in the 90s.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO FUN! I would play it all day if I could...<br /><br />I like how you can go to 3 different worlds. And have to run to get to the world you want to go to! I love it! So fun! Also, the minions you can unlock, cost G coins, but once you reach a level, then the game will start to offer them to you, and you can pay bananas for them.... or you can use real money to get extra G coins to get them. Or. You can save up the G coins to get the minions.....<br /><br />I think it's better than temple run!!!!!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great start to an amazing series. Complex characters and a story that is strong and keeps you on your toes, just when you think you can figure everything out the story surprises you again! A can't put down read.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|clever writing, great songs. some of the characters are annoying but the songs are too good to ignore. it's fun.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy this game very much. It is very relaxing. I would recommend it to others. It met all my expectations.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Great movie.  What more can you say.  Holly Hunter is adorable in this movie and looks amazing in that white dress.  One of her best movies.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|its so awesome I love how you can just let your imagination run wild if you have a crazy imagination then get scribblenauts remix for $0.99
B003YL4LYI|4.0|One of the best series out there!  Plots and schemes at every turn.  What an imagination. Can't wait for the next one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book. Ms. Moriarty's writing  cycled me through so many memories of my own. I laughed and cried and in the end loved everyone.
B008602KQI|5.0|GOOD PRODUCT & TIMING SHIPPING, KEEP THE WAY IT IS AND DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. HAVE A NICE WEEKEND. NHAN TON
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Living in Dallas, this book gave such insight to life here in the early 60's. The Butterfly Effect, indeed! Great read, for sure.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Simple to set, no extra bells or whisles like som3e of the other apps. One thing I found irritating is that when you find a location and set it, you are stuck with it.  If an error is made and a wrong location is set, you cannot delete it. That I found annoying.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is entertaining and provides a nice distraction when needed. The sounds can be a bit tiresome, but the mute button is always an option. Overall, this is well worth the download.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It does what I want it to do.  No bells or whistles, just a plain ole clock you set and wake up to lovely chiming in the morning.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For quickly de-burring a blade or to put the finest edge on one this is a must-have for any bug-out bag, hikers pack, or simply for an every-day, pocketable sharpener. I purchased two of them at $6.80 each on Amazon Prime and expect they'll last for years to come.
B00AEBB9T6|4.0|What an incredible cast, lending itself to this unique project.  When radio was the sole entertainment of a majority of the masses, one was left to their imagination.  This is a visualization of the genre of that period.  Great work.  I had to watch it twice, and follow the back story of it inception, and development..........
B005D9MUWY|1.0|The Google gesture keyboard is way, way better. Plus, it's free. SwiftKey's swipe feature is very poor. Even when done in slow motion, the wrong word keeps coming up.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|this addition to the Bourne franchise, is a thrilling episode.  Subject to some continuity, I could not help but compare to the Matt Damon contributions, and feeling that there was something missing.  Perhaps it was the dead calm delivery, in a frenetic environment, that gave way to the latest version imbued with passion.  Perhaps it was a result of the program meds...........
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome is the only word I can thinnk of. I was on the edge of my seat each episode. AWESOME!!!
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Resent having to purchase additional gadgets for higher scoring. The birds are always fun but I find the games repetitious from one to the other. Angry Birds (original) is still a favorite game for me and I guess its founders have to find ways to make money from it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. Eat bananas, run fast, fool around. Doesn't really need real money to play well. Two thumbs up! Give it a shot.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I can't feel any fondness for the monkeys. Resent additional purchases to attain higher scores. I do like the birds.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|It is fun so far looks to be a big world. interesting lead-in story with small bits of humorous installed in it. there are occasional cuss words as well not suited for small children.that's it for now. going back to the game by.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|A funny film for a distraction, can't take it seriously.  Some great lines in the dialogue, the last line of the film had me rolling (albeit a very politically incorrect line).
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like this game. It had me playing for hours. Just couldn't put it down. I would<br />recommend this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is one of the best games ever. I like to play this game because it makes me get a lot of bananas
B00DBSZEH2|2.0|Era Inappropriate swear words used for shock? I found the use of the F**$# word very surprising as it definitely was not a word used in the era that this movie was supposed to be in. This was a fluff movie with some action and violence to keep it moving. It could have been so much more if they had hired writers for a story instead of just special effects specialists.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I've been watching these since the first Die Hard which seems like forever ago. I remember when that one came out. This one was not as good as the first, of course, but it was entertaining and nice to see old Bruce back in action. The script was lacking not as snappy as some of the past films, but the action made up for that lacking aspect. It's mostly about father and son bonding in a very violent kick butt way. Very entertaining and very macho. Fun!
B00COGY2P2|3.0|This movie keeps you guessing for awhile. But was not a memorable movie.  As soon as I realized I had watched it already, I stopped it. Not worth seeing twice.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Great game just wish I could add friends without going on Facebook, otherwise good time passer and fun game for my children and I.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like that the HO locations change...I can play at a slower pace or spend actual money to speed things up. Great look & feel to play...a little complicated with extra bells & whistles of all the \\"collections\\" to accumulate, and crystals, and the like... which don't really seem necessary...but again, I'm enjoying this one.
159514188X|4.0|i let my sister borrow it and she loves it :).. i cant wait to read it for myself again... thankyou for giving it to me on time  :)
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as good as the Hunger Games, however, you are purposely left hanging so you have to read #3 to bring it all together
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I like this because I can keep tract of important events.and reminds me of future events.I keep track of everything
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I read many of the reviews both good and bad and I just want to say that the movie was as good as the book.  Reviewers love to take something that they could not do in their entire lifetime if they had a full staff to assist them, and run something down.  Staying on topic, the DVD was very good.  It could not (of course) give the same amount of time to the characters that the book did.  Duh! No 90 minute movie can do this.  Overall, it was a very good movie, well worth the money and the time.<br />To the reviewers that want to take something good and noble and turn it into something evil and racial, I've got two words to say to you: prove it!<br />This movie and book did a great job showing exactly what it purports to show.  It portrays black \\"help\\" working their lives away in white households because that is how society developed from slave times to today.  One of the maids says that her mother was a maid and her grandmother was a house slave.  This is exactly the point of the movie and the book.  Society didn't give these women the opportunity to go to college (or even high school in many instances) and make their lives better.  It demonstrated how they felt about their plight.  That was the point of the book and the movie for those ignorant reviewers who didn't get it.  Many reviewers wanted to mouth off about how this white woman (the author) didn't help the civil rights movement! It certainly helps to show people today that many black people really had the cards stacked against them in the recent past.  I don't think she comments on racial events of our day nor should she.  It was a book about the recent PAST.<br />Too bad reviewers don't have to be honest or smart.[[ASIN:B007HCCNJU Kindle, 6\\" E Ink Display, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers (Black)]]
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It would be good if you had grandchildren. Now  I have to wait till she gets old enough to play it. I will keep this .
B00B9366VO|5.0|I only wish Sound City was still in business so we could record on that Neve board. I heard David Grohl owns it now. Share time is over!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Kept my attention for awhile. Would love a second one.I've played this over and over again till I got all of the jems
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I've read the book several times and I was so excited about this movie!  I'm so glad I wasn't disappointed.  It's amazing!!  I loved everything about the movie, great cast, great interpretation of the book.  Very pleased.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Amazing show!!! Not at all predictable, keeps you guessing every episode. Can't wait for the new season. This is a must watch.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved it. It kept me turning the pages to fing out how it ened. Recomened it to anyone who is interesed in great sci fi.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was an awesome mixture of monster ,romance action and just complete awesomeness. I didn't think that he could top the sea of monsters but he proved me wrong in this book. I would totally recommend to any and all people. I DARE YOU TO NOT LIKE IT!!!
B00EOO55GW|5.0|A7X another great album. maybe not as great as Nightmare but few albums are. The songs flow well together and show how the guys have went back to their roots their influences. Its still unmistakable A7X album. It really showcases all of their talents. Nightmare show cased the Rev. and Hail to the King showcases the excellent guitar solos, vocals. The only thing I dislike is what its really missing is a longer set list.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Love this product, have the first 3 seasons already in my collection, all expectations were met with this one....definatly will get another season as soon as it comes out
B00E193TM2|5.0|Cant wait for the second volume. volume one is great and has a lot of collaborations with other artists. You is probably my favorite song off the record so far.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|While a lot of their music is an adaptation of music by someone else, their spin on it is refreshing. Fun to listen to.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and my kindle. I'm a big fan of manning games and this one is my favorite. Never leave home without it!
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|It is quite possible a worse movie has been made. Possible, but unlikely. A wretched and cartoonish rape of an American classic, full of swooping cameras, over-saturated colors, too loud music, and overheated performances. Rarely does the movie pause for a breath, and when it does, brace yourself, because the effects people are about to unleash more visual overload. DeCaprio almost pulls it off, but he is about the only thing in the movie that works, and he is too often betrayed by whipsaw cutting and a camera that can't stand still. Perhaps most annoying of all, nearly all the outdoor scenes are filmed on obvious indoor sets with false looking landscapes digitally inserted. One hundred forty three minutes of your life irretrievably lost, time that might have been better spent pulling your toenails out one by one.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It's 12 in the morning and I just finished the book this is a must read book of all time
B00847KFDS|3.0|I don't know ifJohn Fogerty just needed money or what, but this C.D. is pretty mediocre. Some of the people he chose to pair with for duets are kind of a stretch. Pretty so-so work.
140006922X|2.0|This was a very easy read; the writer had an enjoyable style of writing.<br /><br />After having read the work - several sections were a re-read - and having thought about the text, there were no surprises in the text.  The research methodology was a bit awkward and quite difficult to understand.  The assumptions made throughout the work were something to &#34;ponder;&#34; however, there were no major revelations.<br /><br />For other readers, the work is a source of entertainment; if you are looking for an academic approach to a very difficult topic, I do not believe that you will find it in this work.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|This is a good version for quick updates and check ins.  I would like to change the connections feature to see how many connections I have.
0544104404|3.0|The author did a fine job with the premise of the work.  It was an easy read with few problems throughout the work.  I would recommend the text for anyone preparing to work with diverse populations.
B001QJUX24|5.0|One of the best westerns ever made. One of the best films ever made. Epic. Fantastic cinematography. And then, there is The Duke. It don't get no better than this.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|I have to assume the writers know the real behind the scenes story. I'm enjoying being in New York City and Broadway area specifically. Would love to live the life some of the characters do.
B00CWQAFT6|5.0|Overall a great classic metal album. There are a few lighter tunes there to show Noorah's soft side and give your ears a break, but a solid showing end to end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is so fun and has different costumes although they are to expensive please make it so they only cost bananas not gru coins because the only way to get gru coins is by in app purchase also please add more levels and also please fix the lag whenever there are alot of obsticles my game begins to lag.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Great album full of awesome dance , work-out and chillaxin music. I am very pleased with my purchase. The auto rip feature is an incredible deal. Thanks Amazon!

B00908DDZM|5.0|Oh man, this album exceeeded expectations! Every track is awesome in it's own unique way. Ryan Lewis and Macklemore have mad skills and deserve some serious recognition. I am definitely a fan after hearing this album. The beats and lyrics are in a catagory of their own!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|happy with it. i watched it from my tablet. wish i could have burned it so that i could watch it on my tv, but i guess that is why it cost less than buying the disks. ;) it got the job done. love the show!
B00CE3IC74|5.0|they work excellent, and they have also a better look than in the pictures. I recommend them specially for international purchases, I am from colombia an the shipping arrived just in time with any defect
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I enjoyed watching this series.  Was sad about the ending of Season 3 though.  Will make for some interesting plot twists in season 4.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Wow!  What a book.  I've never heard of Tesla but what an extraordinary man.  I put this book on my Kindle and read while traveling.  I'm going to buy one for my grandson who is an engineer.  He probably heard about Mr. Tesla while in college but there may be some &#34;inside&#34; information of which he is not aware.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is so fun I`m playing the game on my kindle! So fun when I play it! I hope there's a 3 movie!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was ecstatic that Neil Gaiman wrote another  book, and I was  not the least bit disappointed. The Ocean at the End of the Lane was a book I wished  would never end, and even in that ending it tore at my heart strings.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Perhaps the WORST movie I've ever seen!  If you want to watch this, think about a pre-frontal lobotomy first! Ugh!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I have tried several timers.  This one can use my music and can set several timers at once.  Timer can be set with a snooze function.  Timer can be labled and you can choose set labels or add your own label. Great app
B000ZN8036|5.0|This is a film which will have you reaching for tissues but it is really worth watching. It is a true story of one man's journey to discover himself and what is out in the world.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch is fantastic in the title role, he plays happy, tragic, heroic, and victorious so well and takes you along for the ride.<br /><br />Everybody should watch this film.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart is also in this film in a small role but it is a key role to the story.
B00BUCXVPI|1.0|I laughed when I watched the scene in the bar as they found an entire room of extras under 5'4\\" to make the ego-elf look tall.  No suspense no thrills no talent.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great page turner of a book. The story is well told and keeps you wanting to know what happens next, very hard to put my kindle down!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A wonderful book full of love and loss. It takes you to another place where you feel you must have been but don't quite remember.
B00AXVHHTI|5.0|[[ASIN:B000F9ZGL4 ROYLCO R2131 Bright Buttons, Assorted Sizes, Shapes and Color, 1/2-Pound]]I'm not a great fan of British film but I've been converted by Downton Abbey.  It begins with news of the Titanic and the beginning of the 1900's.  I was spellbound; completely taken in with the time period, awed by the fashions, the details of the mansion, the language, the way the servants lived in conjunction with the wealthy upstairs family.  Downton Abbey, the mansion, is itself a character.  I want to look in its many rooms, and am often given the chance to do just that.  Any questions you have about the mores of the time are answered throughout this series by the innumerable problems that the characters encounter.  The pacing is swift and, like a great classic book that is hard to put down, I dreaded reaching the end of this Episode, feeling as if I'd be leaving new but dear friends behind.
B009AY04A8|4.0|love these types of games and enjoy solving the mysteries..nevosoft makes the best version of hidden object games especially with the minigame bonuses
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game because it's just like the movie. I saw the movie and I thought it was great. when I saw the game I had to have it. I love it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|So much has been written about this book, so I will just say that I'm a professional woman in a male dominated field, and this book helped me to name some things that I was doing to perpetuate my &#34;leaning out,&#34; and how important it is for women to be fully engaged with their careers if that's what they choose.  Well worth a read for women and men who work with women. :-)

1933492953|5.0|Reading Marcos's book, Framed Ink (2010), in the fall semester of 2011 re-kindled some old passions, when I was taking some graduate courses in the college of Design at NCSU, as well as some classes in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This is the future for those interested in environmental design and landscape architecture and GIS and other social sciences, as well as those interested in deconstructing superheroes to acknowledge the need for human geographers to understand visual storytelling is an artistic endeavor. Without question, this graphic and literary masterpiece serves its purpose of drawing pictures to raise the consciousness of art as \\"an investigative approach\\" to study life, evident in his \\"Last Thoughts\\" when Mr. Mateu-Mestre states: \\"Creating art will force us to make that extra effort to rationalize the things that are deepest in our mind (p. 119).\\" You should know that every chapter of Framed Ink (Mateu-Mestre, 2010) offers some foresight, hindsight, and insight into the world of animation, graphic novels, and movies by sharing universal principles associated with art, from the strategy of studying the atmosphere to the tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with chiaroscuro and designing shots with a sense of purpose.

0385360185|4.0|Probably the best of the trilogy. Just take these books for what they are, fluff. This one is the fluffiest, in my humble opinion.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. I liked Jaden and Loved Will Smith. The boy's acting is not bad, some seem to be irritated about the fact that he works with is father. Going on about how they Hate a kid pretty sick. If the boy didn't have any ability it would be different but he did his job and I agree with others it was a survival story not so much of an epic type of thing. I will definitely buy this when it comes out. Just see it for yourself don't go by what others are saying, that's pretty much always the best way to go.

1781162646|5.0|All I can say is this book is worth every penny. I would easily place this in a top 5 of Stephen King's best works. Stunning and very emotional. It's a story where you feel connected to the characters and care about them, something that isn't in many books nowadays.<br /><br />Well done, Mr. King. You gave your Constant Readers a real treat.
B00CBKLO52|1.0|This was very frustrating for me. Not at all user friendly and since I am not a geek I had to give up... so sad because it looked like it could have been fun.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|After reading Proof of Heaven, I turned around and recommended the book to my family, my friends, my neighbors.  It has immensely impacted each of us who have read it.  The peace of knowing that Heaven exists, and that &#34;nothing can separate us from God&#34; is the gift this book offers to those who read it.
B008QMMEOE|1.0|kept hanging up my phone and freezing it,,,my virus scan said it was unsafe and I guess it was so I never used it
B003Y74KCK|4.0|This case is a great deal for the price.  I've used it for the last year (with lots of phone dropping) and my screen remains uncracked.  I recently ordered another one though because over time, the plastic stretches out.  You can't beat the price so I'm fine ordering a new one every 12 - 18 months.
0307001369|5.0|this is a great book as it has basic pictures that 2 year olds recognize simple pictures without a lot of extra things to confuse
B008OW1SAC|5.0|This record is one of the best I own, if not the best. Alt-J has made a masterpiece from beginning through end. Vinyl just puts it on another planet.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|took it off as it didn't work and kept freezing my phone also my virus scan said it was unsafe
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun for both me and my son to play. We play together and take turns. He loves it causes  it is ice age.
B005D63ICI|5.0|This season, like its predecessors, delivers what you expect from Dexter: the unexpected. I'm glad I didn't discover this series until after seasons were complete because I enjoy watching one episode after the other. Fortunately, the end of this season seemed like a naturally point to pause and focus on thesis writing before enjoying the next season.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Very entertaining show. Great storyline. I would recommend this show to everyone that likes law and order type shows. Great cast.
0545128285|5.0|I love that JK decided to write the stories that are mentioned in the HP series. They're very similar to stories that are already told in all cultures, but with more whimsy and magic. They teach excellent values and life lessons.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Well written story of an orphaned girl, enlightening portrayal of foster care also. Provoked a good book club discussion, and agreed that we all learned a great deal from reading this book.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|A Depp classic!  I have watched this movie several times and never tire of it. Its funny and serious overall a GREAT MOVIE!
0486266885|1.0|Please don't label me as ignorant, but I bought this book because my high school forced us to for summer reading. It is horrifically boring, as I fell asleep countless times while reading this.<br /><br />It may be suitable and interesting for an older audience, but for a teen, it's just atrocious and mellow. Another book we had to read was Animal Farm, and I loved it!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The one thing this one has over all the other I have is the fold out rail, I really like that feature. The over all device is small and light, and does a great job putting a fine edge on your blade. The fold out rail is aggressive and gets to it, putting that sharp edge on your knife, moving on to the next feature the carbide sharpener and then finishing with the ceramic. I had used a few different sharpeners and this is my favorite. I recommend and would buy another.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Alsp, it always gets p eople impressed bt my tablet.  It's an amazing game to make an hour Fly by
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I am so happy I found this game on Amazon.com this evening. I've been playing for an hour nonstop and I love it so much.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Well you must be a die hard fan to want something this expensive from the hit tv show &#34;The Walking Dead.&#34; But hey, considering what it comes with and the details put into this one-of-a-kind Limited Edition Blu-ray than you can't be That nuts. After seeing the prices sky rocket for the Season Two Limited Edition Blu-ray I knew I had to purchase the Third Season's offer right when it was available back in March. I just received the large box today and was more than thrilled to open it seeing how perfectly wrapped up it was. Inside there it was! The large case with two sets of plastic removable containers for the sorry suckers that got their heads cut off by the infamous villain known as the Governor. All five heads are highly detailed and designed to look exactly like the many from the television show and clip onto the back of the two plastic containers that, get this, can actually Hold water in them. There's a plate on the bottom that allows you to put a battery in that, I only assume, allows you to have the epic effect of the glow from behind the floating Walker heads. The Blu-ray is safety snug behind the heads that also come with accessory &#34;jaws and pieces.&#34; Pretty wicked huh?  With all that said, I say start your Walker collection with this piece at the top of the bookshelf. Five Stars!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I didn't understand the style of the book when I purchased the Kindle edition. The story, was compelling even the nature of the tale involve a family of immortal witch-like women on a farm that is a portal to the universe. I enjoyed the story and was thankful that it was fairly short,
B008J34466|5.0|Every time I think that Pink has released her best material, she tops herself. The Truth About Love is amazing. I bought it the day it came out and it is a staple in our cars.
B00EQ8J1OI|5.0|I am an intermediate swimmer, without much access to live coaches.  This book allows me to progress in my swimming.<br />The instructions are clear, and the explanations make a lot of sense.  An appendix at the end helped me build my own training/learning program.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I really like Final Fantasy III.  I have played a lot of final fantasy games from the time the original final fantasy was released on Nintendo.  You still have your choices of warrior, monk, black mage and white mage.  You still get called Kupo by Mog.  I found the grahics and sound quality both on the game to be great.  I am still playing this now, and it is one of the few games I wanted that I finally did break down and buy.  Although I think it would be nice if they would lower the price of the game some, it is worth every penny.  I don't find that the movement controls are too terribly bad when walking, but I find it hard to zoom in and out constantly to find sparkling things.  You can set the config options as well go help configure the way you move.  For those of you that have played final fantasy, in this one you can switch your job levels back and forth.  So you can switch from red mage to black or from white mage to red mage or even from a Mage to a warrior.
B005TVYVI2|5.0|I use the tempo trainer mainly as a pacer for timing my laps.  It helps slow you down at the beginning of a long swim, and motivates you towards the end.<br />I also use it as a way of speeding up my stroke rate.<br />And it floats.  (a feature that came in handy once.)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun its like you have a real horse its so fun and  great i love it.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Classic film from the 80s. My kids did not find it nearly as entertaining as I did when I was their age.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is really a great game. Love it all the way to the end , and keep you thinking.  I liked the way you can hear them talk not just reading what they say.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This guy wakes up in the morning and pi****es excellence. Sorry for the crassness, but that is the only analogy with sufficient hyperbole to express how much I like this book. He overdelivers with every successive title now.<br /><br />I am a serious hobbyist when it comes to cooking, but it doesn't matter if you're not. Tim Ferriss somehow writes his books to appeal to very broad markets. However each different type of person feels like he's writing to how deep or shallow they want to go into the rabbit hole with him.<br /><br />The book is huge - it's meaty. It's one of the few I would recommend to get in hardback, too. You'll want to keep this one around - it's not a 4 hour workweek where you can rip through it in a day. This is meant to be slowly digested over the next year or maybe even couple years.<br /><br />Enjoy - seriously, you will.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this app!!!!!!!Usually apps that are free aren't that fun but this one is really really fun I would recommend this to anyone who has always wanted or does have a farm and likes animals and don't forget about gardening
B00EV4F5TC|1.0|Complete rubbish. Oprah is a total disappointment, as usual when she is not giving out free things her sponsors provide. Even if there is a shred of truth in this pathetic tale, it is lost in the ridiculous cast of characters. Save three hours of your life, and go for a walk instead.
B008MM9630|5.0|I like this game a lot it is fun and free and free is very good. It takes a lot of waiting but it is worthwhile to wait.

0156030306|5.0|Charlie Gordon is a good-natured, learning-motivated man with an IQ of 68. He becomes the subject of an experimental brain enhancement surgery and records his experience in a journal which comprises the text of the novel. The experiment has also been done on a lab mouse, Algernon. After the procedure, Charlie's mental capacity increases but new, violent thoughts also appear. He also learns that many people he formerly considered friends were actually cruel to him. His resentment and eventual supergenius abilities lead him to self-isolate, with only Algernon as company. By studying Algernon's development, Charlie learns about himself and his destiny, and tries to reconnect with those close to him.<br /><br />Excerpt:<br />\\"This intelligence has driven a wedge between me and all the  people I once knew and loved. Before, they laughed at me an  despised me for my ignorance and dullness; now, they hate me for  my knowledge and understanding. What in God's name do they want of me?  They've driven me out of the factory. Now I'm more alone than ever before. No one I've ever known is what he appears to be on the surface.\\"<br /><br />The narrative brilliantly conveys Charlie's personality changes and deep emotional discoveries. The themes include man's inhumanity to man; scientific experimentation and progress; challenges of maturity, honesty, and sexual relations; alienation; betrayal; and existential despair. The story arc conveys an emotional lifespan -childhood, adolescence and adulthood- in a gripping account of loss and struggle at every level. Highly recommended.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great way to pass time and unwind. Excellent practise tool. Touch tiles good size for all fingers. Very enjoyable and challenges with progressive difficulties.
B004R739LE|5.0|I bought the Orion DayPack 200 to have a more roomy and practical photo backpack for my day-hikes in the local nature reserves, and it fits that purpose almost perfectly.<br /><br />Bottom compartment:<br />With this bag I can almost bring my complete micro-4/3 photography/videography kit and spend a whole afternoon out on the hills, and look like a recreational hiker, not a nature photographer. I can for instance fit all of my Panasonic GH3 with the 35-100 mounted, the 7-14, 12-35, 100-300, a small shotgun mic, Tascam DR40 audio recorder, camera remote, and a medium gorillapod into the bottom compartment and there's still some room for extra batteries and such. You need to pack a bit smart though to fit all that.<br /><br />Top compartment:<br />To access the top compartment, when it is stuffed full, it is most practical to lay the backpack down horizontally and flip the back-padding up. This ensures that the contents of the mesh pocket stays in place, but more importantly, the content of the main compartment won't spill out. Given this, it is also best to organize it the same way when you pack. Accessing the top compartment with the backpack standing up will easily lead to having to redo the packing. This is something to get used to. This being said, the top compartment is quite roomy - roomy enough for some lunch, a couple of drinking bottles (0.5l), a wind-stopper jacket, maps/papers, foldable seating plate, sunglasses, plastic rain poncho, micro-fiber towel and more. Bringing thick clothing extra will eat up all the space immediately though.<br /><br />The build:<br />The construction quality seems very solid, and it is surprisingly lightweight. The basic design is very nice, but it lacks some afterthough and features that would have made it perfect. For instance, it is not designed for use with hydration systems (no way to lead a hose except through the zipper) and the next best thing - having a regular-size water bottle in an easily accessible pocket - is also not possible. If the outside mesh pockets were more stretchy and an inch taller, you could have used those. The vertically zippered pockets outside the top compartment are also too small for water bottles. You need to have a canteen, or stop to access the top compartment for your water.<br /><br />Backpacks often have breast straps, and I feel this backpack could have benefited from one, or at least had prepared some daisy-chain loops on the shoulder straps to attach an aftermarket one to. There could also have been buckles for attaching a hip/waist support belt if you want to use it on long days.<br /><br />There is also no included rain cover. I would not trek out with this daypack on a day with constant/heavy downpour, but such days don't sound the call of the wild either for me, so not really that much of a problem. It will take the occasional shower with no problem, but I'd feel safer if I had that cover to pull out when needed. I'll get an aftermarket one...<br /><br />The last thing I'll mention is that there is no way to quickly pull out the camera on the move. The only thing you can do to speed up camera access is to leave the zipper open and only lock the camera compartment with the buckle. You still need to take the daypack off your back and put it down to get to your camera though.<br /><br />Even with these shortcomings, I think the Orion DayPack 200 is excellent value for the money. My perfect daypack with all my issues fixed would be priced at a different level.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's a really fun game for kids. I'm a brony playing this game game and its great.  I think other bronies and little girl who like MLP should get it. I'm telling you, it's a great game! Trust me :D
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie gets off to somewhat of a rough start without any real character or plot development. It does recover towards the end. The story is unique but I'm sure the book was much better. There's just not enough time in this movie to tell the whole story.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed watching it so I would loosely recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game no problems kids loved to try to shoot the animals fun for all Americans put down have fun
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns and found this to be a continuation of good books by this author.  His writings of Afghanistan before and during the various wars is enlightening and his writing style makes for a good read.  And you do see his characters as real people with real lives
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I waited to watch the movie so I could ' read the book first, and I'm glad I did. Sooooo good I couldn't put it down
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|After reading The Kite Runner, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I decided to read the other books that this author has written - and I was not disappointed - a page turner from the beginning.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It is amazing I love how it tests your mind but keeps the fun in it. I love playing this game with friends
B0094M2ITG|5.0|Great movie, great story, great acting.  I'm sure it's not for everyone.  I've watched it a few times and every time I get something more from it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy playin. So much that i play on my husbands profile as well. I look forward to keep on playing.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|After the first two seasons my expectations were at the highest level. With the events unfolding as they did in this set I have had to re think my evaluation of the series as a whole. After doing just that I still come to realize that this third DVD is still perfect.  As with life there is always unexpected  occurrences that don't seem to fit into your own scheme of things yet we will always, hopefully, go on with acceptances and proceed along the journey. Downton Abbey Season 3 has enough continuance of what you come to expect from this production that it brings you enjoyment and anticipation every single episode. My total satisfaction with each character has me euphoric: the perfect timing of Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess, the complicated but deeply understandable rogue image of Thomas, the loveable Anna one of my favorites, and the many other perfectly human characters give me much to enjoy. I could enumerate the complete cast and each actor as absolutely wonderful. Not one was a poor performer; not one was unbelievable. The complete ensemble provided perfect movement to the storyline with no dull moments nor lulls. I must tell you I have watched the full three series more than once and am already set to enjoy them again now while waiting for the fourth much anticipated installment.

B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love the game, easy to follow what needs to be done, fun for all ages. There are some challenging ones but love playing until I got three stars.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|There is a good action figure for everyone in the family with a story line that keeps their attention throughout.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Perfect case for my favorite headset. While traveling, it protects and charges my headset. On arrival, I leave the case plugged in and store the headset in it at night. When I need to move, the case goes in my briefcase and the headset in my ear. That gives me three charges or approximately 21 hours. One in the charged headset and two from the case.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is quick to pick up and hard to put down!! The only downside is so far no refill on hints!!
1444777556|5.0|This is a book I found to be excellent in many ways. It was filled with pathos and humor. A touching, uplifting story about a man on the edge of society who helped himself<br />to find his way back with help from a delightfully independent ginger cat, who like him, was living by his wits in a uncaring and sometimes hostile world. It was fascinating to hear how the two connected with each other to help each other through difficult times. How they understood one another even though one was a cat and the other a human. I appreciated the fact that James became totally committed to the care and protection of this deserving animal. It lifts the spirits to see that kind of connection.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|It was so refreshing to read a book that had me laughing out loud.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Rosie Project.
B00DPY95D6|5.0|After reading some of the reviews I knew I wanted to read this book.  I love how the author combined the thriller and court drama into one great book.  The detail in this story was impeccable.  I personally enjoyed the relationship between Cheryl and Daniel it made for great reading.  If you like drama get this book.  If you like a good thriller get this book.  Heck, get this book if you like to read...PERIOD!  Excellent book.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|I never cared for the Beatles when they were the rave...it hasn't been till I've gotten to be older that I have come to appreciate some of their songs.  Some of still a little off the wall for my taste, but the simple songs and ballads I love
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Hamlet is Shakespeare's greatest masterpiece, and this production powerfully portrays the full complexity of character, beautiful, soaring language, and grandeur of this incredible work. Kenneth Branagh, along with the rest of the cast, is stellar. To me, this is the gold standard by which all other productions of Hamlet are measured.

B0094K1K8I|3.0|It had a good build up and some great startlers, but it was very Blair Witch and you wondered why the dude had the stupid camera running for every second of his day and night.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|I enjoyed all of the new characters of this show. It was good to see a story line based on the characters and everyone was a star not just the captain like the original Star Trek
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved this series, cant wait for the new season to come out.  I had rented season 3 on DVD but decided to rewatch it on my kindle to remember what happened in season 3.
B005K17RU0|5.0|One selection from home and I'm there.  It surely beats waiting for a computer to boot up and it is free.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie was awe inspiring about a fresh out of college girl trying to make her way in the world by making  a difference.  Emma Stone plays a young reporter & aspiring author who has a kinmanship with the &#34;help&#34; (servants) in her hometown.  She persuades them to do a tell all at a time in history when blacks were looked down upon and still being treated inhumanely by white folk.  I think the movie clearly shows us how much we should revere the older black women.  Not only did they raise the white children but encouraged them and gave them words of wisdom.  They paved the way for all women to go out in the work world and try to balance their home life with making a living.  These women displayed courage in the face of all the hardships they were placed through in life and are to be admired.  This movie is their voice.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Disney family movie.  Nicely done.  Just a lovely film to watch for a family movie night.  Not many of them around any more.
B001MNFOIW|5.0|I think the main character is who we all want to be at some point in our lives. We get tired of what we think we are so we can find out who we are and what potential we have.  I know that I do and believe it or not, I want to be him in some ways . Great action packed movie with an ending that is somewhat a surprise. I recommend it to anyone who likes action, eye candy and not just for the men. The guys are hot, too.
B000002J1M|5.0|Had Foxtrot never been produced, it is possible Genesis may never have become the giants of progressive rock that they are remembered for. Sure, the band's previous output had been admirable, but after giving this album a listen, it is clear that this was all just buildup. Here is where the combined lyrical and instrumental talents of the group truly emerged. Peter Gabriel gave his finest vocal performance, Tony Banks gave his finest keyboard work, Mike Rutherford his finest bass work, Steve Hackett turned in a guitar performance that is unmatched to this day, and Phil Collins kept bashing on his drums (his drumming was already perfect)<br /><br />The album opens with what is probably the most well known song from Genesis's early days, Watcher of the Skies. This is the track where their final identity as a band emerged. They combined hard hitting rock with thoughtful lyrics and spooky atmosphere to produce this progressive masterpiece. It is ironic, because the rest of the songs are so wonderful not because they follow in the same vein, but because they are so different. Excepting Get Em Out By Friday and a certain album ender we'll get into in a minute, the rest of the songs are gentle acoustic songs. The lyrics on Time Tables are perhaps the most thoughtful of all early Genesis songs, with Peter Gabriel giving a beautiful performance as he sings of \\"a time when honor meant much more to a man than fame\\".<br /><br />Of course, the aforementioned Get Em' Out By Friday stands out as possibly the strangest of all Genesis songs from any era. It has a wonderful keyboard/guitar duel throughout the song, calling back memories of the Musical Box and Return of the Giant Hogweed. The rather forgettable Can Utility and the Coastliners is the weakest song on the album, but it still is not weak enough to bring down the album in anyway. Of course, with these four songs it already would've been one of the better Genesis albums. It's what follows that makes it THE best.<br /><br />After the gorgeous Horizons (reason to buy this album alone), Genesis launch into their greatest work, the epic Supper's Ready. With a story taken from the Book of Revelation, the band uses this 23 minute suite to showcase all their finest work. It shouldn't work. It really shouldn't. The song is really a series of seven songs strung together into a single piece. This could've been a ridiculous, even laughable utter failure. But the reason it works is perhaps because the individual songs work so well individually. I often find myself listening to the Apocalypse in 9/8 or the gorgeous opening Lover's Leap on their own simply because they are so wonderful as solo songs. But taken all together, they are something truly magical.<br /><br />In short, Foxtrot is a masterpiece. While some argue their subsequent work is stronger, and it will probably not do much for those who have known Genesis only as a pop band, it's my opinion that Genesis couldn't get any better than they did on this album. This is one of the few flawless progressive rock albums, and it is a true masterpiece.

B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|Even though the fight scenes were not as frequent as I would have liked, they were explosive.  I loved that part of the movie but it was lacking in a real story line. Fan of both Christian Bale and Taye Diggs but this movie lacked substance.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This movie is for anyone who has ever listened to music...any kind of music, ever. You don't have to be a music aficionado to appreciate what this documentary has to offer.  It includes incredible photos, film & commentary spanning the life of Sound City - and no, I had no idea there even was a Sound City. But now I do & respect what wonderful music they made!
B00CLT31D6|3.0|The gook is someowhat outdated, but still gives some good, pragmatic advice. It's well written and if you're really not familiar with how to manage your finances or you overspend, then the book is worth the read.
0399255370|1.0|Boring!  I found the book tedious, not interesting and each color's letter went on and on about how unused and abused they were.  Really!  I didn't think this is a book I want to read to my Kindergarten and first grade students.

Pistone aka Donnie Brasco.I would highly recommend<br />anyone who likes a good mobster movie to purchase this one.  I would also like to thank DVD&Media Express for handling my order. You people done good job.DVD<br />came  packaged great shape and very prompt. thank you and keep up the good work<br /><br />Terry T&#62;<br />.

B005ES1232|5.0|I thought for that last month that perhaps I ate too many salty chips at work and my feet were showing the effects of retaining water. I had questioned to myself,  that perhaps my feet were growing, (but I knew being over 55 yrs old that was unlikely).  It was not until one evening getting out of my car and I went to put on my shoes for work that I realized it is the clog. They shrunk so much that the back portion of the clog was hitting my foot at mid heel point.  I am a RN and work the night shift.  When I get out of my car at home, off come the work shoes, and on come the home shoes. I did google &#34;shrinking croc clogs&#34; and guess what?  They do shrink when exposed to high tempertures.  I had left my crocs in the car during the day, the car heats up in the summer sunlight, enough to shrink my crocs.  I wish that the company would of put that warning label on the package or tag when they sell the clog concerning this problem,  but they do not.  I did order another pair, as with my heel pain in one foot, these are the only shoe right now that gets me through a 12 hr shift.

I thought the premise of the story was very interesting...the &#34;violent gene&#34; theory was captivating and intriguing.<br /><br /> I enjoyed reading it from the father's point of view.<br /><br />It just didn't develop as I hoped it would. I felt let down near the end. Not only did it end abruptly, it just left me cold.<br /><br />I think it could have become a much longer complex story and have taken more twists and turns. Just totally bombed for me..

B00640UICA|1.0|This game has a fantastic concept behind it, combining unique gameplay with making you think hard to get all the stars. I would have given this 5 stars solid, however I've had to restart the game 4 times. In my opinion it's extremely frustrating experience so I can't give this a recommendation to anyone.
0060919760|2.0|This book has received great reviews.<br />He writes it under grammatical rules, he published it using procedures, in other terms he follows rules of normal societies.<br />Why do we follow rules, laws ... Simple, if we don't things would get out of control.<br />I have the impression that this book tells people that because they have followed the rules in life they are unhappy and \\"YOU\\" have to do what ever YOU want because that's best.<br />Why did he follow grammatical rules in the book? Why did he do what other professional told him to do?

B00DHHWYAW|5.0|The Great Gatsby, a literary masterpiece, is now a visual feast. So stunning is the cinematography that the excellent performances by the lead cast, most notably Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio are lost in the dazzle.<br /><br />In many respects this is the movie Francis Ford Coppola envisioned with [[ASIN:B005KBP50Y One From The Heart]]  his failed attempt to create a fantasized dreamy  Las Vegas. Only this works, because unlike One From the Heart the visual richness is tied to a classic of American literature and the equally classic icon Gatsby.<br /><br />In 3D the film is magical if at times a bit like a Red Grooms in the Hamptons diorama. It is the one movie to have for your 3D monitor.

Again, love this movie!!

This book book brings the crazy right to You from the start, the sex is hot but it gets a bit too much and makes you wonder if that's all they got . Nobody is that needy ever so that got my head spinning , overall it's a must read because you are committed go the series and we just have to find out how far and crazy everyone is.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I received this set today and have it build already! It is wonderful. Easy to understand instructions and three different options to make the delorean depending on which movie is your favorite. It even comes with the original outa time plate and the future barcode plate that I was pleasantly surprised about. I have no complaints! If you are fan of this trilogy this is a must have.<br /><br />I have read other reviews that you can't put Doc or Marty in the delorean, Unless you remove their hair. I managed to get Marty in naturally with his hair. The trick is while you build it, after putting the flux capacitor in and before you start to build the roof, place Marty or Doc in there then continue your build. Only one of them fits at one time, but is possible.

Jump distance may not be so different but the quality of colors change dramatically using this flash. Also internal flash in auto mode is at the autonomy but with this flash, it always works so you'll get desirable picture in any situation, certainly not professional but considering the size and difference it makes, it's an awesome all around flash, a must have.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|I had doubts about Scott Bakula as Captain of the &#34;original&#34; Enterprise, but I was pleasantly surprised at the great assortment of characters that pulled me into the various stories.<br /><br />In this season, a majority of the episodes involve a long arc of the &#34;Xindi&#34; attacking Earth and the crew pursuing them, trying to discover where they are building a superweapon that will be used to destroy Earth. I would have preferred a shorter arc (maybe four episodes) and more &#34;exploration&#34; and introduction of various species, but it kept me involved.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best books I've read. That's saying a lot since I've read close to a 1000 books. I think it's great that ebooks have given new authors like Hugh Howey a chance to show their talents. This was a very unique storyline that kept you on your toes through every page. I wish it had lasted longer. What else can I say but for the price, you can't go wrong with this series.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|It is hard for me to find movies I can watch with my son, but this was one of the best. My only question is how an 11 year old boy dragged a 1,000lb robot out of the mud, up a cliff, and out of the junkyard in the rain.

But beware, we watched the entire season 1 in one sitting plus all but the last episode of season 2.  We could not wait for the next episode. I really loved it, I highly recommend it even if you are not a Sherlock Holmes fan, this series is so worth it.

B001K3KK0Q|5.0|A real classic, this version from 1974 with Rebert Redford, Mia Farrow, Bruce Dern and Karen Black beats the heck out of the latest one with Leonardo Dicaprio.  It so perfectly captures F. Scott Fitzgerald's vision of Gatesby & the rest of the characters.  Leo Dicaprio's Gatesby seemed clownish, pompous & shallow in comparion;  Robert Redford's Gatesby was a lonely, haunting romantic who's untimely death tears your heart out.
B006S053K8|5.0|Adventureland excellently captures the humor/drudgery/bittersweetness of working at amusement parks. I watched this movie after working a particularly long and depressing day at the State Fair and was pretty moved by the movie, actually. Even those who don't personally relate to the specific job, will find it's a poignant coming of age story balancing comedy and drama. The 80s/90s soundtrack along with Yo La Tengo's evocative score brings it all together and makes watching all the more satisfying.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the best musical/movie/event EVER MADE!!!!  It is a &#34;must have&#34; for my CD collectables!  5 stars!
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Update of previous review as of September 6, 2013.  Have now used the Platinum for a while.  The case coming with it is quite nice, leather and easier to get in and out than older cases with Gold model.  And it is lightening fast.  I notice that the on button seems to take a little more holding down to come on than on my Gold models.  Not a big deal but could explain some of the reviews indicating problem with buttons.  I have found no problem with other buttons.  The Gold model I bought 6 years ago has the 0 and the + signs nearly worn off but the one I bought 31 years ago still has all the white letters clear as day I bought it.  Must be change in paint and hopefully they corrected in Platinum.  But will not know for some time about that.  Also I notice that the size of the numbers is slightly larger in the Platinum model but they are also slighter fainter than Gold model.  Not an issue indoors and have not used outside.<br /><br />I have owned HP calculators since first produced in the 1980's starting with the HP80 and buying one of the first HP12c models.  That one is still working although its rubber feet have been replaced but otherwise has worked fine with only two battery changes in 31 years.  Several years ago bought a second of these for a second office and it too works fine. My daughter dropped her HP12c recently and so decided to give her my gold model and replace mine with the Platinum (although she may talk me into keeping mine and giving her this one!).  The Platinum model comes with a nice case with place for business card, which is nice if lost and someone honest finds it!  Also place to engrave your name on the back.  Has the usual quick start formulas on the back too although I find with age those get harder and harder to read without magnifying glass.  Takes two, easy to find, inexpensive  CR2032 batteries which are very long lasting in the lithium form.<br /><br />What impressed me most vs the gold models I have (more recent may be fast too) isjust how fast the calculations are done.  Having an undo and back button will be handy and while understand their including both RPN and Algebraic entry form anyone who has gotten used to RPN not likely to go back.<br /><br />Comes with a quick start guide and a user manual in pdf form.  Usually do not like those but found this one loaded quickly on computer and should be relatively easy to use.  Fortunately still have my manuals for when they put them out in paper form.  But for formulas you use infrequently but are complicated having in pdf and ability to print out those formulas could be extremely handy, better than having the complete user manual.  Can always laminate them or put in plastic sleeves in notebook for ones you use a great deal.  Companies put out this way to save paper and money but in this case it might actually be an improvement!<br /><br />It is amazing that in this world of technological change that this calculator has changed so little since its introduction 31 years ago. I cannot think of another technological product that has survived this long.  True it is faster now but otherwise its functionality remains the same.  Easy to recommend for anyone that has need for a top of the line financial calculator.  And over the years the price has dropped too.  Have noted some have questioned the quality but so far have seen nothing that indicates to me that this is a problem.  Should I find that to be the case I will come back and revise this review.

The book was misleading on who one of the main characters were but I understand it i guess.<br /><br />There is one part of the book that I loved and when you get to it, you will laugh just as hard as I did.
B0001ZXM54|4.0|The Lil' ol' band from Texas makes their case as one of America's best and most durable outfits here. Their older '70s material really stands up well which can't always be said for some of their '80s missteps. If you thought their experimentation with a drum machine and keyboards was sacrilegious (as I do) kindly avoid the (gulp!) &#34;mixes&#34; of the last couple tracks on this collection. The rest is pretty prime boogie cats!
B00E8JZILA|5.0|My introduction to the series \\"The Walking Dead\\" was not through the TV series nor the graphic novels. Instead it was Telltale's fantastic \\"The Walking Dead\\" on Steam. The story of Lee Everett, a convicted murderer, and Clementine, a little girl whose parents are missing, make this game stand out than most \\"AAA\\" games. During your struggle to survive you encounter many characters and obstacles and it's up to you to make the choices with both. \\"What do I say to them?\\" and \\"Will this affect me later on?\\" are but a couple of the many questions you will ask yourself as your choices affect the story of the game. The gameplay is that of a point-and-click adventure and this simplicity helps you stay focused on the story. The Vita port gives us the traditional analog controls and the iPad-esque touch controls. Give the touch controls a go but in the end you're more than likely to go back to the more comfortable controls of the analog sticks.<br /><br />The Walking Dead on Vita was first announced at E3 2012 and is one of the main reasons I purchased the Vita as I wanted to play one of my favorite games in the best portable form and worry not, this port delivers. Unlike the botched Jak and Daxter: HD Collection on Vita, The Walking Dead translates masterfully with smooth framerate and console/PC graphics. Only sacrifice is the slightly-more-than-occasional load time but it's a decent price to pay for an overall smooth experience.<br /><br />All in all, if you have a Vita and have-or-never played The Walking Dead before, buy this game for $25 for the cartridge, or $20 on PSN. (2.3GB btw on PSN) Enjoy this wonderfully crafted game that also includes the recent 400 Days Episode! Play it now as we eagerly await for Season Two of Telltale's The Walking Dead!

B000SEFNMS|4.0|This is a really interesting read.  I recommend it to anyone from middle school to adulthood.  We visited this area of the country in Alaska and actually met a tour guide who knew all about this person and the story because it was close to where she lived.  I bought the kindle book because of her interesting summary of the story.  It is well written!  It's a good lesson to those out there who take the wilderness for granted.  It doesn't matter how smart you are or how prepared YOU think you are.  The Alaskan wilderness can swallow up even the most experienced outdoorsman.  This poor kid was so ill prepared.
0761169253|5.0|I'll start by saying that this is a very thin, but a very heavy book. Thin in terms of the number of pages and heavy in terms of the topics the author discusses.<br /><br />The author gives many examples for 'Re-mix seems to be the order of the day'. I was floored when he said 'Our failure to copy our heroes is where we discover where our own thing lives. That is how we evolve.'.<br /><br />Conventional thinking says 'keep yourself busy all the time', but the author goes the other direction to show why being bored is critical to be creative.<br /><br />Kleon highlights the importance of getting an education even after your schooling days. It helps you to get curious about even the most commonplace. Being surrounded by books seems to be crucial for any kind of growth and I resonate with this very well.<br /><br />There are people who crave for being in the lime-light and there are others who do silent, great work behind the screens. The book suggests being in the latter. Kleon tells the only way to become popular is to do good work and share it with people.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a book that tells you how to add value to your life by adapting these ground-rules.

B005B0QYMM|4.0|This movie had a great build up and overall I thought it was good, 4 out of 5 stars. Now for those of you who have not seen this movie I recommend watching it. But I advise you, stay away from the second one its not good,trust me. Spoiler alert, what's so good about the first one is that you don't know why these \\"patient demons\\" are trying to kill the crew and why the doctor is performing lobotomy on some of them, and the satanic book and skulls and stuff. It makes you fill in the blanks and you can come up with different theory's about it. this movie has somewhat of the same kind of style of motives for the killer (Michael Myers) in the movie Halloween 1978,see Michael goes aroung killing babysitters, but its much more than that. There are some reasons that Michael would be killing, 1. he's insane(sometimes this theory doesn't work)2. he's controlled by a more darker demonic sort of force and so on. But what Im really trying to say is that sometimes not knowing makes a movie scarier, and that's why the sequel to grave encounters and the 7 or 8 sequels to Halloween sucked(not including 2 because that was still good in my opinion, and 3 because it has nothing to do with the Michael Myers storys but whatever). Thanks for reading and watch this movie.

B0036S4B6M|4.0|OITNB is an intriguing, and often heartbreaking, look into our nation's prison and incarceration system. Piper's experience at Danbury is certainly one worth writing and reading, and I would recommend the book to anyone. Aside from constantly comparing the book to the Netflix series (which is absolutely worth watching), the only issue I take with the book is the writing. Kerman's narrative is choppy, awkward, and often very simplistic. There were a number of occasions where she began to talk about what could have been an insightful and powerful experience at the prison, but then inexplicably stops and moves on to some other event. There were just too many times where her story became too detached from what her actual experience likely was, and it was frustrating to be drawn into an emotional event only to be left out in the cold.

It has a wonderful aesthetic, and incredibly useful ribbon thing for marking pages, and the elastic band slides over the cover easily to keep the thing closed while in transit.<br /><br />I use this to keep track of assignments for school. It's small enough to fit in the front pocket of my backpack for easy access. It's also large enough that it isn't a pain to write in. There's lots of reference pages, tabbed pages in the back, I love this thing. Does exactly what it should do in a much more pleasing way than competing planner things.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I had Aspahlt 7: Heat since it was released, and let me just say \\"amazing\\". Asphalt 8: Airborne is over the top. With much improved graphics over the 7th one. This game is by far the best car racing game on the market to date.<br /><br />+ Graphics: (5/5) = The graphics from this game are amazing. Starting to get up to par with consoles.<br /><br />+ Gameplay: (5/5) = The controls and gameplay are easy to get used to. Easy to handle and very smooth.<br /><br />+ Performance: (3/5) = The game runs extreemly smooth for a while. If you play it for more then an hour the performance starts to lag. It got to the point where it froze my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and I had to completely restart it.<br /><br />+ Sound Effects: (5/5) = The games sound effects are on point.<br /><br />PRO's:<br />+ Gameplay is great.<br />+ Graphics are phenomenal.<br />+ Sound effects are good.<br />+ Multiplayer is nice.<br />+ Includes Amazon GameCircle.<br />+ Lots of cars to choose from.<br />+ Good selection of maps.<br /><br />CON's:<br />- Performance has some lag issues.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The game is only $0.99 and is well worth that price. If you want the best car racer on the market, then stop looking. You found it. This is the best there is. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of that performance bug. Other then that the game is perfect. I'm sure that will be fixed in a future update really soon, but until then 4 stars is what it gets. Hope you guy/girls enjoy ths game and thanks for reading.
1475972350|3.0|I gave Time Keeper a star for being the most original idea I've come across in a long time. I have never read anything close to this idea in all the books I've read and I have read a few. Readers who like reading about man's inhumanity to man will love the brutality described in Tim Keeper. The serial killer is doing away with people who have wasted his time. He does this in inventive and very cruel ways. Not only that, but he is also making them pay up for the money he feels he has lost, because time is money. That is what he keeps mumbling the whole time he is doing his violent dirty work. I think this writer has one hell of an imagination and I feel the writing will get better over time.<br /><br />This is just my personal opinion, but I think the writer could have done so much more with this concept. After such a title and such a great idea, I felt the writing should have been a lot better. The main characters lacked depth, they weren't developed enough, and most of the dialog just didn't seem real. This was such a great plot, and I was disappointed in the way the story was handled. His two detectives, lacked personality, and I found myself almost rooting for the killer, because he was the only one that made me understand his motives. This book did one thing for me. It will certainly make me think twice before wasting anyone's time.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|ive always liked a7x this new album is great just like the rest.  highly recommend to any body. bad ass
B005J0VPNC|1.0|Tried downloading and installing Paper Camera last night, as a freebie, but to no avail. Tried again just now, possibly at full $1.99 cost, yet still to no avail. Never had this problem on my Kindle Fire HD before. Was really looking forward to seeing the results of this app', but guess it's not meant to be. Confused and disappointed.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I found this book very hard to put down fast pace and interesting plot twists kept me guessing till the very end.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This heavy duty knife should perform nicely throughout the entire zombie apocalypse! After several stabs through cardboard zombie effigies, this knife has kept its keen edge and given me confidence that it will deliver hundreds of zombie head shots will no ill effects. Also, this knife can be fastened to the end of a bamboo pole relatively easily making it the perfect tool to have on you when your Fed-ex flight crashes into the ocean. Just remember when spearing fish to always aim high. Sometimes I talk to it...I love you Ka-Bar Becker.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I am so glad you carried this season.  I had no idea we had missed the entire beginning of the show and loved to watch every episode to learn about each character.  They couldn't have chosen a better cast and have just started the second season to watch the new characters emerge.  Quality was excellent, but sound could have been a little stronger - maybe it's my ears.  Thank-you.
B0098460O4|5.0|I love every single song that they sing as a duo.  There is a magical energy between them and I look forward to the next duo album.<br />Not only do they have angelic voices but they have a beauty and charm that is unique.
0425263924|5.0|Sylvia Day is a master at romance writing.  I patiently waited for this book (tapping my toe, impatiently).  Reread book 2 to launch into 3 and it's worth it.  I haven't heard when/if there will be a book 4, but, keeping my fingers crossed.  Thank-you S.D. and keep them coming.
B00860YICC|5.0|The acting by many was so awesome and the music enchanting.  One of the movies that I treasure and watch again and again.
B00701L5XS|5.0|I love this app. my scout uses these knots in his troop and it has been one of the easiest things for him to learn. great app just love love love it.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I really like this app.  I am always up for a challenge and like that this one delivers.  Just when you get on a roll and think these are easy, it throws one in that makes you have to stop and think.  Great way to pass the time and give your brain a little workout.  I would recommend this for anyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't add anything new. This series is captivating and I enjoy watching every episode. Never disappointed, usually surprised. Don't start watching it unless you are ready to become obsessed with seeing what happens next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool even its popular with six dollars.<br />A lot of crafting stuff a friend's play too awesome
B006RXPUR2|2.0|I heard this book was great, but I couldn't get into it! I have no specific reason as to why though.... Seemed like a good plot though.
B0083EW97W|5.0|Saw John Mayer at Bethel Woods Center last week. I went because the opening act was Philip Phillips, who was great, and wound up falling in love with John Mayer. I came home and immediately downloaded his entire catalogue. This album is so well put together. The songs are soulful and his guitar work is incredible. His guitar style is old school but still today. Wonderful album

B005EXA8XC|5.0|Are you kidding me? if you love music particularly Grunge you have to have this DVD. Nirvana is clearly in there prime during this concert. Got to love Kurt with his second hand sweaters, I love it rock on. I remember when Nirvana came home in 91, no I didn't go to this concert, my bad. I still get to see it on DVD. Nirvana's music still rules, if you appreciate good concerts then get this DVD. It's unacceptable that the BLU-RAY version of this concert's audio is out of sync that's why I bought the DVD version. Seriously if you check the reviews, all the negative reviews are buyers that bought the BLU-RAY version and all the good reviews are from buyers that bought the DVD.  Nirvana was pretty amazing live.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It's pretty fun, and you don't really need money to actually have fun, which isn't that common. Especially with multiplayer games
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I absolutly hated this book, at every turn all I could think, was dumb dumb girl..........RUN!! I have no idea how this book got so popular, I'm really begining to doubt Dr. Oz, I bought this book because several of my friends and family raved over it, and the sequels, REALLY?? WHY? a bunch of BDSM drivel, do women really want this life style? can a man really love you, if he gets off on causig you physical pain? Pfffft, please dont read this book, it's whole moral concept is revolting.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|How refreshing to have a film that tastefully confronts and weaves together - disability, rich, poor, humanity and hope.  I think the fact that it is not an American film makes it all the more real and possible.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This is a real classic and is probably Bogart's best film.  Bogart runs a night club in Casablanca and is involved in lots of under handed deals with the police and others.
B0082A3HTQ|4.0|It takes a bit of getting used to - the mixing and matching of R&B and Classic, but it grows on you.
B004K58GSO|5.0|This is one of my favorite John Wayne western.  Everything (story line, acting, cast, etc.) is great.  Wayne's sheriff friend becomes a drunk and Wayne returns to the town to sober his friend up and help him get the bad guys.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I enjoyed every aspect of the movie. It had comedy, drama, action, and it is family oriented. A huge plus in my standards.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|This is a great Hitchcock film and probably my favorite Cary Grant flick.  Grant is mistaken for a secret agent that doesn't exist.  The bad guys apprehend Grant and he gets away ... etc. A real cat & mouse type action through out the movie.
B00CXVX1OQ|2.0|I didn't enjoy playing this particular game. It  is boring , lacks spark. It is geared towards children between ages 7 and older.
B002ZBJ6SY|3.0|I already had &#34;Hang On&#34; and &#34;Broken (feat. Amy Lee)&#34;, so, when I saw the whole album on Amazon for $5, I got excited. However, no other songs really stuck out than &#34;Hang On&#34;, &#34;Broken (feat. Amy Lee)&#34;, &#34;Pig&#34; and &#34;Get Out of My Way&#34;. Slightly disappointed that only 4 songs stuck out on an album with 20.
0525478817|5.0|This book was amazing! I received it earlier than expected and finished it the day it arrived.<br />I can't wait to get Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska, and An Abundance of Katherines next.<br />John Green is a magnificent author and will go down in history.
B005KXT58U|4.0|Personally, this is my second favorite Evanescence album behind 'Fallen'. Highly recommend the tracks &#34;What You Want&#34;, &#34;Made of Stone&#34;, &#34;My Heart is Broken&#34;, &#34;Sick&#34; and &#34;Oceans&#34;.
B0086QS7N2|2.0|I prefer old Rush -Caress of Steel, 2112, Farewell to Kings, Fly by Night and Rush are what I prefer, the new stuff just doesn't resonate for me.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Not for the weak of heart.  Very violent movie, but I really think there was alot of real history in this movie.  It was gritty and was probably a good indication of what life was like at that time for some people.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|First of all, I admit that this book was written in the first person and I don't like first person narratives. Nevertheless, Child has woven an interesting, even unique, plot that kept me turning the pages late into the early morning hours. Fortunate, the author changed to third party narrative, and the rest is history.
B004N6369Y|4.0|Danielle steele never writes a bad book atleast i haven't found one yet. In this book she really pulls at ur heart, like most of her stories.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Awesome game especially for free and the scratches are only 45 minutes apart which means you don't have to wait till the next day for coins to play!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This charger provides the most convenience in charging your headset when you are not home and it allows for two charges so now I would not be afraid that my headset will die while I am on the phone.
B001XUIBNO|4.0|Slow to start, although it had an intense and unique climax. Definitely a Jack Nicholson movie! If you're looking for strange and unsettling, the last half of this movie delivers.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Nolan has probably been the biggest director in the last few years and Di Caprio is quite possibly at the peak of his prowess (though I hope he stays there for many years to come). This team up was highly anticipated and I don't think they disappointed. Psychological/Deep Sci-fi has probably became my favourite genre (they should create that name for this genre if they haven't already), and along with Alien, 2001- A Space Odyssey, Inception is right up there at the top in this genre.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Classic Kurt Vonnegut. I was required to read Slaughterhouse 5 way back in high school and, while I enjoyed the book, I think this would have made a better introduction to the writings of Mr. Vonnegut. The book revolves around a obscure religious leader and his cult, the workings of a third world dictatorship that pursues the cults followers in a alternatingly  vicious and benign way, the amoral pursuit of scientific progress, and the writer who just wanted to do a piece on one of the fathers of the atomic bomb but ends up documenting the end of the world. Man ultimately outsmarts himself and brings not just humanity to a end but the world itself. With no hope of recovery. The book is a absurd apocalyptic nightmare whose believability is actually enhanced by the absurdity of the events and characters. If humans ever do bring the destruction of the world about it will likely be through just such a unpredictable and bizarre chain of events and not through the obvious, and so avoidable, causes we all worry about.
B009JBZH54|5.0|In the case of movies, one generally has to look over a few years' timespan to be able to filter the mere good from the top notch stuff. In the last eight years or so, Nolan's Batman movies stand out above others. People say Keaton's Batman was better, and while I am planing to watch his movies on Amazon Instant sometime, I think I will have to keep my fingers crossed hoping Burton's movies match up to Nolan's. Batman fans might have been spoilt forever by this trilogy, they have set such a high bar.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is really fun.reminds me of growing. up as a little boy.the thing better would be at the fair shaking the machine and getting the quarter that fall out.<br /><br />l
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I loved this movie. I have seen it over 20 times. It has comedy, good music, and a good overall cast. Looking forward to the sequel.
023076651X|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to students of online business building. I would recommend however that you purchase it from another seller. It took way too long to arrive. 7 to 10 days has always been my experience with anything I bought online, but I waited over three weeks to get this book.<br /><br />I did get the book, and it was in brand new condition, so I will give the seller that much. I just didn't appreciate waiting so long for it to get to me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hooked after watching the first episode! I had heard about it from others and thought I would give it a try.
B007FROH4G|5.0|Insightful and informative.  So valuable for anyone faced with dementia in a loved one.  Positive, kind but very real and I could completely relate to all the emotions.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|This book gives you an inside look at what our amazing service members did to serve our county in Iraq.  Chris is a true American hero.  Humble and courageous, Chris is the ultimate warrior.  May he rest in peace.
B005K17RU0|5.0|So far no crashes on my Kindle (1 month).  Maps work fine for what they do.  More map layers would be useful though.  The forecast hour by hour for wind, clouds, dewpoint, ... has kept me more comfortable on my bike.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Very meaningful but had to concentrate to understand it. Definitely glad I read it though. Good insights on suffering and surviving.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Great spin on the old classic.  Easy to learn simple controls, but offers challenge . little pricy for simplicity .
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I've read the other reviews, the majority of which go like &#34;this sucks, nolthing happens in this book compared to the 4 others&#34;.<br />I completely disagree: I love the attention which was given to digging a bit more into the characters. Moreover, a lot is happening and let's hope the author will finish the next volume as announced by next year!
0060245867|5.0|I give this book to children and adults. I come from a family of DIYers and so often projects take on a life on their own. Being able to quote from this book keeps a sense of humor going.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I *had* to read this before the movie is out!<br />Great story, great writing. It's really interesting to be inside the kid's head.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love this show and now I have the DVD to watch anytime I want.  Thank you again Amazon.  thanks.
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Second album from AMOB pure Rock GOLD. The guys do an awesome job bringing us well known songs from yesterday! Only second best to their first OMERTA!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I couldn't find this memorycard anywhere in retail stores including Best Buy and the local camera shops.  I found it on Amazon and was so thrilled I bought two.  Amazon always comes through for me!!!
B00DURILJ2|5.0|Watch this movie! Matthew McConaughey delivers the dirty goods, along with a terrific supporting cast of beautiful lady, great kids, and the plot-line works for the casting. If you enjoy a little salt in the air, a little salt in your beer, or a little salt in life, you'll enjoy getting a little muddy in thus one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best post apocalyptic novels I have read in decades. I would've passed it by if not for the glowing reviews from other Amazon readers. So I am leaving a quick review of my own before moving on to the next installment of this series. The writing, characters and plot unfold with suspense, intelligence and pathos. I cried, hoped, smiled and raged against the machine along with the characters. You will too.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Great movie - I have become a history buff and just can't get enough. Great actors/actresses - thanks for great work.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Liked the game very addictive. Me and my daughter share the game and I like that I can move the stuff she buys.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the perfect solitaire game for me, the changes to the deck are brainless and fun, game is still challeging when you want it to be
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I wasn't sure about this game and once I downloaded it, I played it all thebway through.  It gets easier the more levels you play though. I do wish there was a little more direction and maybe a hit every few levels.
B0062QFZ10|4.0|Berg/Beethoven: Violin Concertos is a 2012 harmonia mundi recording starring violinist Isabelle Faust as she plays Alban Berg and Ludwig Van Beethoven. Jean-Paul Montagnier has written the music notes. I am not a huge fan of Berg so the first part gets a 3 but the latter part with Beethoven gets a solid 5. So it ends of with a 4 out of 5. Recommended. 4/5.
0399226907|5.0|Love this classic children's book. The board book is exactly what I wanted. It is the perfect size, not small at all, and a wonderful story.
B0055G0BGW|5.0|Handel: Agrippina is a 2011 harmonia mundi recording under the direction of Ren&eacute; Jacobs who leads Akademie Fur Alte Musik Berlin. Ren&eacute; Jacobs has written the music notes and it also includes a synopsis. Sunhae Im (soprano) does an excellent in the role of Poppea. Truly a splendid recording that I very much recommend. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I would not have even looked at this if it wasn't for the controversy that brought it to the general public's attention. I read in the reviews and learned from personal acquaintances that the book doesn't really bring any new information to the discussion; however, it was new to me, and I found it very interesting and presented in a way that was very palatable. For the most part, Aslan was respectful of the Christian religion while remaining true to his promise to write about history. I personally was not offended and it actually piqued my interest in learning more about this historic period.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Both I and my daughter loved it! We just couldn't put it down!!!! We can't wait to see what Suzanne has in store in Mocking Jay!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app alot. I love that it is full screen...makes it easy to hit the right keys. It seems like everyone is trying to make money with apps so I really appreciate it when a useful app is free. Thank You Digitalchemy!!

B000UGG39Q|5.0|Down's third full length release \\"Down III: Over The Under\\" (which was released in 2007) is nothing short of pure brilliance. It is truly one of the best metal albums in my humble opinion, I mean not one single word can't really describe how awesome this is. I just love it. I've been a big fan of Down ever since I was 18 when I first bought and listened to their classic 1995 debut album \\"NOLA\\" back in 2002, and it instantly became one of my favorite 90's metal albums. Then Down came back in 2002 with their second album \\"Down II: A Bustle In Your Hedgerow\\", and while that album was not as heavy as \\"NOLA\\" was, but it was still an amazing album nonetheless. Now fast forward to 2007, \\"Down III: Over The Under\\" is a much more different beast than the first two releases, but it still has all the classic elements and trademarks that this New Orleans metal supergroup is so well known for. The songs on this album are a lot more complex, and the production courtesy of Warren Riker (who also produced the band's second album) is more sophisticated as well. The lyrical themes on \\"Over The Under\\" include the band's anger and frustration about the devastation and destruction of their hometown of New Orleans at the hands of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, as well as singer Phil Anselmo's frustration over the murder of Pantera/Damageplan guitarist Dimebag Darrell in 2004, and the bad blood between the two of them up until Dime's death. The band's musicianship of course is outstanding. Everyone on here is in absolute fine form. Phil Anselmo does less screaming and more clean singing on here most of the time, and believe me, Phil can sing just as good as he can scream, and this album is indeed proof. Meanwhile, guitarists Pepper Keenan and Kirk Windstein are both at the top of their game, busting out heavy, hard hitting, gut wrenching riffs and also layering some different parts together to create awesome songs as well. The rhythm section is also very tight and outstanding as bassist Rex Brown pounds the ears with his strong, meaty bass lines, and Jimmy Bower keeps the listener's head bobbing with his heavy, rock solid drumming throughout.<br /><br />The songs:<br /><br />Every song here on \\"Over The Under\\" is a standout, I mean they all rule. \\"Three Suns and One Star\\" is a strong, monstrous, energetic opener which begins with a nice pumping guitar intro which is reminiscent of Black Sabbath's \\"Children of the Grave\\" including some spoken vocals from Phil, and then the song kicks straight in high gear with heavy, pounding, energetic Sabbath-esque riffing and head bobbing drums, and then Phil bellows out the line \\"The old dog has to learn a new trick and more...Or the next trick will be on him\\"!!! The song also features a slow and catchy Southern influenced breakdown in the middle which slows the song down a bit before picking up the energetic pace again. The second track \\"The Path\\" is a slower yet still heavy number highlighted by heavy, crushing doom/sludge like riffs plus a great melodic guitar solo as well as excellent singing from Phil, while the following track \\"N.O.D.\\" is another groovy and energetic number which boasts more heavy, pounding, head bobbing drums and ear ringing cymbal crashes, along with more pounding, crushing riffs and bass lines as well. Track four \\"I Scream\\" is another outstanding song on here that features more great riffs and awesome vocals from Phil with a mix of singing and screaming especially with the screams at the end of the song. Another one of my favorites, track five \\"On March the Saints\\" is another addicting and energetic monster riff driven number highlighted by more of Phil's amazing vocal work, plus more awesome thundering chainsaw like riffs, and then an awesome breakdown is thrown in around mid-point, and the rest of the song turns into a straight up mosher that includes a catchy chant-a-long vocal refrain of \\"MARCH\\". Meanwhile track six \\"Never Try\\" is a nicely restrained, slow-burning brooder that slows things down, and includes some gobs of nice and tasty bluesy guitar leads, as well as some wailing melodic soloing to boot, while track seven \\"Mourn\\" brings back the sludgy heaviness in full force with thunderous riffing, beefy rhythms, and more stunning soloing as well. Next up, we have \\"Beneath the Tides\\" which is another one of my favorites here that features dark, intense, pounding guitars, juicy, flowing bass grooves, as well as another stunning and powerful vocal performance by Phil to go along with that. The next track \\"His Majesty the Desert\\" is a nice calm, mellow, and atmospheric interlude that leads right into the tenth track \\"Pillamyd\\" where the boys come right back with a barrage of thunderous and bludgeoning riffs, hefty, booming, monstrous drum beats and crashing cymbals, awesome soloing, and catchy sing-a-long choruses, making this song a heavy, booming, rip roaring riff monster. Definitely another highlight on here for sure. Moving along, we have track eleven \\"In the Thrall of It All\\" which is another epic highlight featuring more amazing riffage including some catchy wah wah guitar licks as well as some more impressive solos are thrown in the mix, and there's also a nice acoustic outro at the end as well. Then finally we have the album's closing track \\"Nothing in Return (Walk Away)\\" which is my absolute favorite song on the album hands down, and also one of my favorite Down songs too I might add. From the almost Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin (Houses of the Holy era) stylings in the intro, to the heavy and heartfelt riffing and melodies, to Phil's amazingly emotional and powerful vocal performance, not one single word can even describe how amazing this song truly is. A perfect album closer this is, it even brings tears to my eyes when I listen to it.<br /><br />So in conclusion, \\"Over The Under\\" is a triumphant return for Down five years after their last release, and it musically and lyrically documents the lives of these five New Orleans natives throughout those five years of catastrophe, tragedy, and ultimately triumph all culminating in an absolutely brilliant modern metal masterpiece. There is absolutely no question Phil and the boys have definitely hit another home run right out of the ball park with this album. So anyways, if you're a fan of Down, Pantera, Crowbar, Eyehategod, Corrosion of Conformity, or just metal in general, then you'll definitely love this album by all means...Strongly Recommended!!!<br /><br />\m/gs down, and includes some gobs of nice and tasty bluesy guitar leads, as well as some wailing melodic soloing to boot, while track seven \\"Mourn\\" brings back the sludgy heaviness in full force with thunderous riffing, beefy rhythms, and more stunning soloing as well.

1452000247|5.0|Like Lewis Carroll's Alice, Peter is drawn into a world of mystic creatures and powers. Where Alice's adventures border on following the paths and advice of somewhat mad but lovable characters, excluding the Queen of Hearts, Peter is thrust into a dark realm of chaos. He learns to help in the battle between good and evil, finally opening his own mind where the Cirinian has him imprisoned.  It is a masterful tale of fantasy and dark enchantment, and suitable to all who wish to surrender to the chills and thrills that William O'Brien portrays!
B005LAIGZU|4.0|Nice movie although the storyline is about the same as every other movie but good shows overall. Nice gear showing
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I've never been a fan of Country type music but, Taylor's mix of light country sound and pop style make it enjoyable to me.  It was her pop hits pounded into me on the radio that piqued my curiosity.  Overall, I really enjoy this entire album.  It soothes me and also gets me moving.  I'd like to hear more of her music now.<br /><br />Thanks.
0312944926|1.0|Like much of Hollywood, this technical parts of this book are written for excitement not accuracy.  I don't think he accomplished either.  I'm not even a huge stickler when it comes to technology.  When a scientist can somehow write a virus for an alien technology whose operating systems he knows nothing about (e.g. Independence Day), I wince, but I still enjoy the movie.  With the poor writing in this book, I winced and hated the book.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can say more that what was already said in a lot of the other reviews, but I will echo them.<br /><br />I didn't even take any cryptography classes on my way to a Computer Science degree and the cryptography parts of this book (not to mention the other computer related parts) were painful.  I knew the climax before I'd gone too far because the cryptography in the book wouldn't work the way Dan Brown described it.  It took a whole novel for the expert NSA cryptographers to come to the same conclusion that a person with a Bachelors in Computer Science with limited cryptography knowledge had already come to.  I hope the NSA's top cryptographer knows more about cryptography than Dan Brown gives them credit--for the safety of the United States.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Angels and Demons and the DaVinci Code.  I guess I'd better stick with Dan Brown books on subjects that I know absolutely nothing about.<br /><br />And if you're thinking this guy must be the one who writes all the one star reviews, think again.  This'll be my first and my last.  I rarely finish reading books I hate.  I just put them down.  I don't know what I was thinking finishing this one.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|Having heard a few of Selena's songs on Slacker Radio I couldn't help but purchase some.  There were more albums than I expected so I went with the one that had songs I'd heard and I am very happy with it.  It's all fun, happy and feel good music.  I need that in my life.  I look forward to purchasing more of her music in the near future.<br /><br />Thanks!
B001DJLD1M|5.0|We still like the Matrix, after all these years so we were glad to buy it so cheap.  Aside from my husband liking it just for the stories, I love Keanu Reeves and will watch him in anything.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Of all the CD's I bought at the same time this was the one that I was hesitant to buy but, it ended up being the one that I enjoyed the most.  A review I read by a woman my age (41) is what sold me.  She laid it out in a way that sounded like she too had reservations but, like myself, was pleasantly surprised by the both fun and serious sides of Ke$ha.  I look forward to hearing more of her music.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie and cannot agree with some who say it was too slow.  There was so much beauty to look at and such good acting and the story may not have been unusual but it was  realistic.  If you are not older and cannot identify with the characters in any way, than you might only like it if you are a deep thinker or, as someone said, work with and like seniors (or have parents this age).
B000J103PC|5.0|Meryl Streep is a magician on the screen. Emily Blunt steals the second  seat from Anne Hathaway with her on point portrayal of the conniving co-worker. The clothes are stunning. The script is knife sharp, and clever. It is absolutely worth watching a time or two!
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Exposure (iris), aperture, shutter speed; these are the most confusing things to learn in photography. Bryan makes it as simple as if you are learning nursery rhymes. Kudos to the genius.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|A great cast who do their parts well, of course. The story is a bit over the top, but the actors could pull off anything. Personally I am not comfortable with Hollywood's insistence that everyone buys into immediate sex with no consequences. Predators don't suddenly turn into faithful loyal companions. These movies annoy me.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love the music, the acting, and let message that it sends.  I am totally hooked on the sound track and my wife watches the movie all the time!
B008VSEJPK|5.0|This book is great , it clears up a lot of misunderstandings a lot of people have-  at least it cleared it up for me it explains everything in Avery clear way and at the end of each chapter it has exercises , and  links to examples suggestions for further reading I enjoyed reading it and I highly recommend it-
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have been a huge fan of David Baldacci for years.  Often in his books he grabs your attention in the first couple pages, this book is no different.  I found myself trying to read it ANY moment I had a chance. I am having my fiancé read this book (he is not an avid reader), but he is breezing through the book. He is loving the action and suspense. I have never seen him read a book this fast!
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|I read the book years before the movie came out. I had the video but the DVD takes up less space. We need to be reminded that this happened in the 20th century and to say NEVER AGAIN
B0083Z614S|5.0|Good reading at any age.  Uplifting and captivating.  You can't help but be in the magic of the garden yourself.
B005LJETYI|4.0|Bought the book to read before seeing the upcoming movie. Did not disappoint. Very good story. Will continue to read this author's other books.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I have a bunch of different knives, each has its own benefits.<br />This one is very strong and has a lot of weight for its size.<br />The only negative I can think of is that I did need to use some locktite on the screws that hold the handle on, apart from that this knife is flawless.<br /><br />Of course I have lighter & thinner knives for tasks that suit lighter & thinner knives and I have longer blade knives for tasks that suit a longer blade.  But then I have this knife for tasks that suit a knife of this size.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have purchased, now I can get all my gmail through my kindle just love it, if you have gmail this is the app that you need on your Kindle.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game with a lot of opportunities. you could run through different areas and have fun! I think that the game should offer more coins.
B000QJM8Z0|3.0|This book wasn't what I expected. I enjoyed the movie better. I feel this was a waste of money. Lol
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Started off a little slow then it got way better can not wait to read all the rest if them
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was  very impressed as a man I expected this nook to b  really dumb because th  heroine was a girl. I expected  it to be all about love  an  feelings. She is awesome. Can't wait  to read  th  rest
B00EAI9CSY|4.0|First off. I hate vampire movies. Vampires as a metaphor or literal, terrible plot device in my opinion. Almost as bad as zombies or werewolves.<br /><br />But...<br />I like this movie.<br /><br />The sense of drama is not overdone, there are some funny parts you have to laugh at the utter seriousness of it. Its not really \\"new\\" but I think its right up there with Warm Bodies and Beautiful Creatures. There is the idea of bringing horror into realism and asking the question: \\"What would it really be like if...\\" and then making a movie out of it.<br /><br />Now to be fair, I am a deeply cynical and jaded movie watcher. My initial reason for choosing this movie was if the wife wanted to see a vampire movie at least don't make me pay $15 a ticket for it, lets stay near our bathroom and fridge on our couch with our headphones and do this.<br /><br />I filtered this movie out based on 4 star rating and currently in theaters; wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />If you like vampire movies? Even better, you'll love it.  If you like drama, romance and vampires, this movie has just enough dialogue and story to get you by until the next movie.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This movie is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. I laughed so hard at so many parts.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|will not install might be a good game but if you can not get to run who knows fix it please
B0013ND30M|5.0|my daughter loves this show. How ever beings that we have watched it 20+ times I am over it ha ha. In all seriousness though its great. thank you
B00005JKOI|5.0|If you're into the 80's movies this is a good one to watch, Molly Ringwald at her finest the original brat pak. You'll love her in Pretty in Pink.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I have five grandsons!  Ivan and Gregory of 6 and 5 downloaded this game on Kindle. They like this game!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I absolutely love this app!! It is the best one I have found. I can finally use my kindle firs as a fully functional computer!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|So incredible. Stop wasting your time and buy this book!  Fantastically gripping. I loved every minute of the time I spent reading this book. &#34;Life changes on a dime...&#34;

B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is the best kindle game EVER! It is so real world...ish. The best thing is that the game play physics are so realistic. Keep up the good work!
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I hate reading and I loved this. This is the first book I read all the way through. Haha. Amazing.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Highly exciting and intriguing. I absolutely loved the interview style and the description od each nation's response to the crisis demonstrates Brook's fantastic cultural insight.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It'$ ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fluffy oh yes herre the world and night in herre to get you started in herre the world is messed
B006S01GH2|4.0|Nice film with great characters in the world of Amelie. Worth the time and it kept my interest.  Fun to see some of the views from Europe.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I've become completely addicted to these games and this is one of the better ones. Don't start. You won't be able to stop.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a very good series!  Most interesting to watch. It is very dramatic and charming and a nice love story, so far.
B00E9PXI3S|2.0|Very disappointing. In recent interviews De Palma's has spoken pridefully of his careful pre-production story boarding. He has also described himself in rather highfalutin terms as a &#34;visual stylist&#34; and &#34;abstract expressionist.&#34; I didn't see much evidence of the precisely story boarded visual designs of which he speaks, though the film is stylish in a kind of eurotrashy way. But &#34;abstract expressionist&#34;! Give us a break. This is a really silly movie, the characters are poorly written, the plot points are feebly constructed and the performances by two excellent actresses decidedly subpar. The ballet is lovely but gratuitous. Like what's the friggin connection? I think it's pretty arrogant to do a remake of an excellent French thriller and then claim (as Mr. De P has done) that he has made it better by making it his own. This is second tier De Palma, and that's sad. Maybe it's getting to be time for the guy to put down his view finder and rest on his considerable laurels.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I don't know how anyone could ask for more proof of heaven.  I purchased the cd so I could listen again.
B00005O5CM|4.0|A cute chick flick with Reese Witherspoon's character as a strong role model for young women. A great motivator if needed.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|I loved this movie in the theatre, and rented it to share with friends.  It froze at 1:44min in.  UGH
B009AMANBA|5.0|A great depiction of our 16th President. Daniel Day-Lewis performs in an outstanding manner as he depicts the character of Lincoln.
B00CHRBA12|4.0|Funds being what they are, I chose the double disc set for this.  The original album sounds fine.  There's Jessica, a little longer, and the hit single Ramblin' Man along with Wasted Words.  All old friends to revisit! Then there's disc 2 with a couple old blues, a Wasted words outtake and an equally qualified Jessica, also labeled an outtake.  We revisit Eat a Peach staples Trouble no More and One Way Out.  It's a decent buy, similar to the expanded Eat A Peach album, released some years back.  If you're intrigued by the Allman Bros band, and want a little more, then this is great exploration model for you, although in my mind, the first 2 albums with the full band are the best record for this group's impact on the then fledgling Southern rock scene.  Add Fillmore to see how they were live.  Brothers And Sisters are just icing on the cake.
0785153942|3.0|After seeing Pacific Rim, I wanted more. I wanted to know the backstory, I wanted to see the little references expanded on, and all in all I wanted to support such a heartfelt, quality movie. This graphic novel didn't quite scratch the itch. The writing is uninspired and it's told in a fairly generic way. The characters don't grab you very much, and the art is merely okay. They attempted to tie far too much together and as a result, the world feels smaller, not bigger for their efforts at expanding the universe. It doesn't go into the detail you expect a graphic novel to do, and I found the design of the prototype jaeger to be decent at best.<br /><br />If you're a diehard fan of Pacific Rim, you'd likely enjoy it and not regret your purchase. Anyone else, I recommend you stick to the movie and save your money for the Blu-ray when it comes out.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Everything you would want in a period classic! Amazing scenery fantastic acting! It gives you different realms to live in and side with if you choose!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The storyline picks up almost immediately from the first book, but is practically all roses after their reconciliation. Aside from the glimpses of the stalking ex (sub), and Anna's corrupt boss and loathing for Elena- there's virtually no conflict. I thought the book was decent, but far from exciting. I hope the loose ends make for a much better plot development in the next book. My take on this book of the trilogy:  It doesn't require an entire book for Ana to reiterate how much she is \\"in love with this beautiful man,\\" and for him to finally admit it himself, with boundless sex (pun intended) all in between. I expected much more, Mrs. James.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There has been a lot of hype over these books. It was readable, but not great.  Just not my kind of story.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|The story smash your heart.<br />It deals with the lost that a person feels for his own life. It's an elegy of who u should became compared to who u really r. The damage of time and failor, the goon squad, u can hardly survive.<br />The story moves it a surprising turns and routes, it keeps u alert.<br />I was waiting to come back to the book. When it was over I felt it got inside me, as if I met a person I care about.<br />If u love stories about what is happening in people souls u will adore it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I was going to call this read refreshing, however fresh better describes it. Pam is an incredibly talented and engaging writer who challenges you to open your life to beyond how most think it is. This was my first Pam Grout read and I'm now a fan! Great work. Thanks Pam!!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This book is a fantasy at its best. It tells the story in a way that seams imagery to the daily life but true in a deep sense. U read it and it is unbelievable and makes sense, un usual and familiar.<br />the story contains a lot off small charming stories. A lot of dreams for those who love dream. Fascinating characters.<br />The main character is lovable. He is not an ordinary guy but he is human and it is easy to identify with him.<br />If u love epic fantasy we will enjoy it a lot
B00AC8ZJ6K|3.0|The movie is watchable but more for the people that have followed the Halo mythos.  If you haven't played the games this movie won't mean much to you.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Cute but boring after awhile. The story is enjoyable but after awhile I got tired of the characters and of the plot. The characters do not evolve and their basic lines r not enough for the log run. The plot is fun till half of the story and after it is not surprising or interesting.<br />Still it has grace, it has love for humanity, it is honest writing. U might enjoy it if u r in light full a<br />Un demanding state of mind.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|awesome but glitchy. at times.  very fun. cannot wait for the sequel. more enigmatis. give me more. love these games.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Another Dicaprio film that is exciting and fast paced.  We enjoyed it watching on big screen just like in the theaters.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Love &#34;The Heist&#34;! Macklemore, Ryan Lewis and others have done a great job with this album and I can't get enough!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is great if you need a mobile bible that has an abundance of translations. Since the translations are downloadable or accessible via the web app it is extremely versatile.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|See my review of season 1 which explains my view of this series.  It is well worth your time if you enjoy adult dramas.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|My reading of choice is non fiction and therefore Lean In seemed like it would be a great read.<br />However I thought it started off strong but the middle to end seemed to repeat some of the earlier stories but with a slightly different point. The Acknowledgements at the end seemed to be a significant  large part of the book.<br /><br />Overall some of the concepts that Ms.Sandberg were informative and valuable for women and men.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I only started watching The Good Wife in the middle of the last season. Amazon Instant Prime has given me the opportunity to view the previous seasons before the new season begins.<br /><br />This show is well written, keeping me guessing what is going to happen next.  The character development feels natural, in the way that a person would usually get to know someone they have just met. It is interesting to see Alicia's (the main character) development from shell-shocked homemaker to lawyer that is only known for being the wife of the disgraced state attorney or the friend of a named partner to a respected and skilled courtroom attorney.<br /><br />The complexity of the decisions that the characters (lawyers, family members, investigators, political operatives) must make are true to life in that there no easy answers. Should reconciliation happen with a cheating spouse?  What should an adolescent believe in or do when faced with the growing pains of sex, drugs, friends and their parents' jobs? How do you deal with an aged, interfering in-law/mother? Will the firm represent despicable, perverted, unethical or criminal clients not because they are entitled to legal representation but because their money can keep the firm from going under in the bad economy?  Is loyalty or personal power the guiding force in forming shifting alliances within the firm with or against other partners or co-workers?  How far should an investigator go and what are they willing to do, to find out the information they are charged with learning for their employer?  These dilemmas occur frequently in this series with specific episodic predicament's to keep things fresh.<br /><br />I would recommend this program to anyone who is interested in a drama with adult themes and humor, without gratuitous violence, from the point of view of a decent, principled wife/mother/lawyer, viewing the inner workings of politics and the justice system from both sides of the courtroom.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love this game but some off the tasks are hard to do and you dont getchance to do them in time
B003ZSJ212|5.0|it's star wars in a box set, need i say more?  my only complaint is that it isn't offered in dvd!  oh well, gave me an excuse to get a blue-ray player.  watch and enjoy in hd like never before!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great read! It was a page turner with an interesting twist. I would recommend the book to anyone that enjoys a good book.
B00BESM14U|5.0|absolutely loved this movie!  it's a coming of age story.  charlie has a troubled past and is starting high school friendless.  he then meets sam and patrick.  you'll fall in love with patrick from the first second he's on screen.  people have said it's like the new breakfast club.  not really a fair comparison to me.  this one is much better!
B008476HBM|5.0|This is my all time favorite book and was glad to be able to read it in bed at night on my kindle fire during a low period in my life~it really made my day~I have read the hardback book countless times so wasn't sure I'd enjoy it on the kindle but it was a pleasant reading experience.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A real saga.  Kept my attention completely focused.  Filled with nuance and fun, pathos and danger.  Wonderfully engaging with a unique magic system.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Plot jumps all over the place.  It may all come together at the end but is hard to follow.  Not very interesting.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Fantastic series, I recommend reading the books first. This show just keeps you wanting more! Can't wait for the next season to come out! Whoooo season 3
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love to play this game the graphics are fantastic and I don't want to step after I start. Can't wait for the next release.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Detailed and gritty presentation of the events surrounding the locating and attack on Bin Laden's hiding place. Well worth the price.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I do not like the constant asking to get onto facebook. I just want to play the game with no interruptions.
B00003CXAA|4.0|This is a nice collection of the three movies. Conveniently packaged in an attractive sleeve, with an additional DVD with bonus features.
B00AS88FKG|4.0|Since Batman: The Dark Knight (Batman 2) raised such high expectations of course this one failed to measure up. But, standing on its own, it is a very good movie. With a tortured hero and dastardly villains this dark movie may not be to everyone's liking but the plot and acting is mature and very good, thus the ranking.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is an accomplished actor; this is one of his best performances. Compelling and believable presentation of historical event.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I've been really enjoying this game.  The graphics are pretty straight forward and I like that they try to have reasons why you are looking through the massive hoarder piles of stuff.  My only complaint is that in the scenes where the room is dark it can be difficult to search around your stylus or finger. The navigation in these scenes is a little wonky, but it doesn't come up too often so its tolerable.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Another great movie, with Ben Affleck at his peak. Would recommend this film to anyone interested in the subject, especially those who love Affleck.
B004RKXNDU|2.0|THEY HAD JUST MADE THE MOVIE AND I HEARD IT WAS GOOD.  I HAD HEARD OF THE AUTHOR, AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS GOOD.  HOWVER, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOOK.  TOO MUCH UGLINESS, TOO DARK, TOO COMPLICATED, WHEW, IT WORE ME OUT.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love the music in Les Mis and have it on my ipod.  That just wasn't enough.  Had to buy the movie to watch again and again.
B005IULERU|5.0|My throat became sore from laughing so hard reading this book.<br /><br />It is a very fast read with one text per page, easily finished in one sitting.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I had seen Life of Pi and loved it so gave it as a gift to my parents.  They are having a few health problems but still love to stay up on current movies.  Well, they loved it and plan to re watch it with their grandchildren and great grandchildren.  A movie for the generations!
B00DGMVC4C|3.0|I found Sparkle 1 to be much harder...almost too challenging but I kept playing it until I finally finished.  Sparkle 2, although I like the larger size is not near as challenging and so somewhat boring. I would like to see a Sparkle 3 that is in between the two.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|Always watched Stargate on TV so now I can relive the oldies when I want to see them Thanks to Prime it is great.  Never know where the gate will take tme in time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Works great on smart phone and on Kindle Fire. My 10 yr old grandson thinks this app is great. 5 stars
B00000G3I2|5.0|Bought this to replace our CD, like the DVD better. Was college friends really like that?  Makes you think obout life
B004I744AS|5.0|I have been using this app for a while now on several devices. Never a problem. I definitely give this app five stars.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Lots of action and if you don't mind the violence, Syvester Stallone and other great actors are great. Exciting to watch and see who else will show up in the movie
1476733953|5.0|I am not a big sci-fi person, but this series is awesome!  Keeps you guessing and thinking. Then when you are done reading, you start to ponder how this all applies to society.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I'm a Treky fan,the DVD's are better than the CD's I have, I how have the full collection and happy I could get them  Now to start on the New Star Trek Generation
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What a good game,not to taxing but fun.once you get started you get sucked in and Don,t want to stop. GREAT.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|Glad I could add this to my colection to replace the CD of have of it. Looking for the others to go with it.  Like the action
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've been saying for a while that the internet version of Magic is horrible and that these nerds were really missing the boat by not having a mobile app game. Then all of a sudden...BAM! Here we are. I am stoked.<br /><br />I am four games deep on the free tutorial and am hooked. I plan to pay the ten bucks for the full version no problem. I hope it's like Words With Friends where I could challenge a friend to a game and then we rotate turns at each others convenience. It could be like a long ongoing game! Whoever makes Risk should do the same thing.
B00B4Z5J92|1.0|Didn't like this one I was looking something else to watch with some action or adventure.  This will talk you to sleep.
B00338QENI|5.0|Very interesting and informative. Rebecca has brought a understanding an thoughtful narrative to what could have been a difficult subject. A great touch of humanity
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|Cute movie! Children were satisfied and it has been watched many times. Would recommend for anyone who loves the smurfs!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Terrifically well written, imaginative, page-turner. This one will keep you guessing. The ending was perfect! Do not be put off by those who want a pink, bow tie ending. This is a marvelous read that is pure genius. Absolutely loved it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Beautiful thought provoking story you find yourself asking who really should judge someones right to die!!  Could not put this down!!!!!!
B00CA4S3UI|4.0|I liked this release. However.... do not listen to it just once or twice.<br />This is an album that needs 5 listens minimum to get to know the songs as individual tracks.<br />The vocal performances are not in question but the melodies could have been stronger for this listener.
0439023521|5.0|I love things involving dystopian societies, post-apocalyptic worlds, and the like. Very enjoyable (for me, I mean).<br /><br />Also, people really need to stop with that whole plagiarizing Battle Royale (which is equally good) thing. It's true that they're a bit similar, but even then, the concept wasn't exactly new.
B005PK57NU|5.0|The show is well written the characters, well developed. I really enjoy this show and can't wait for the next season to be released
B003F3NDWG|4.0|got this for my sister and mom who are castle freaks. came on time and they have enjoyed every minute.
B000IHJ2B8|5.0|We never get sick of this movie, my hubby is definitely impressed with my taste-- even tho it is considered a guy's type of movie I am totally into the action.
B0053O89KG|4.0|got this at the same time as the other for mom and sister. i think this season is their fav.
B00C9G22R2|4.0|The cinematography was worth the price of admission alone, and I can honestly say that this film was a study in creativity and the beauty in each movement.  For the first half of the movie, there was almost a  meditative quality in every action.  About half way through the film, when the Sino-Japanese war starts, the movie becomes a bit of a downer...  which of course can be life and war; but if you like happy movies, this might not be the flick for you.  There was another comment I read where it noted that about 20 minutes of the film was cut out for American audiences.  After reading what was cut, I would say that it was integral to the plot and should have been kept.  Without knowing what was missing from the film, the depth of the relationship between Ip Man and Gong Er doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.  (The edited version makes it seem like one of those old movies where the boy and girl have one dance and all of a sudden they're in love.)  So if you watch knowing that, it will help make the movie a little less confusing.  Overall, I found this to be an interesting and insightful look into the ravages of conflict and the humanity of people who are esteemed as masters.  This is one of those movies that kind of gets to you at your core and makes you think about life. So, if you're looking for pure escapism and fun, you most likely will not enjoy this movie.  Also, it has subtitles, so if subtitles aren't your thing, you might not enjoy this film.  But, if you are in the mood for something less \\"entertaining\\" in a modern sense of the word, and instead a slower moving, deeper experience, than you will walk away feeling it was well worth it.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|cant have the second and fourth without the first now can you? thank goodness they have all 3 so far to trade off.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is an amazing story about friendship, love and family. It also offers fantastic insight about how heartache can truly make you crazy! Very honest, a great read!

B00005B36H|5.0|I love every Tool album in its own way, but this one is overall my personal favorite.<br />Message to first time Tool listeners: The first time you listen to a Tool album, you probably won't like it. Give it a week of listening, you will come to appreciate the complexity and genius.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I didn't kbow how to approach this book, because it had been stereotyped as an children's book but soon found myself loving it. It mixes greek mythology information into a childs adolesce and gives you more to look forward to. It reminds me of the Harry Potter books. This book and those that came after will grab your attention even if you're not a child anymore.
B000001EL7|5.0|Awesome rock and roll! This reminds me if when I was a little boy in the '70's, and KISS were super heroes!
B00992CF6W|5.0|love the game it is not rip off at all it updates from time to time  it is not a slide<br />show
B00C061I3K|5.0|It's been a long time coming. Terrific pieces by a terrific group. A tribute to with a short narrative therein by Giorgio Moroder, the godfather of modern day electronic \\"dance\\" music of my era. Check out \\"Chase\\" from the movie, Midnight Express-it'll send shivers up your spine. A very enjoyable album.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely love this application on my PC. It is so nice  to have multiple locations that allow me to my studies. Also works great on my Hp tablet
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am surprised at how much we are enjoying Downton Abbey, both Season 1 and 2. This period in England, at the beginning of the 20th century, is not one I am especially familiar with so I can learn a bit about the lives of the aristocracy and the servants who made their lives possible. Every time I see a view of the &#34;house&#34; itself, I am amazed that such an edifice existed for a single family. The number of specialized servants that took care of every possible daily task is astounding. The characters are engaging, even the villains. I can understand why this series has gained such acclaim. It's just a lot of fun to watch. This way of life is gone forever, and that is for the good, but looking back at the class stratification that existed is like watching a totally different world.
0525478817|4.0|My daughter likes it. Amazon acount is mine, so I report her opinion. I guess I´ll read it. Too depresive?
B002M87V0A|5.0|OK, so the plot is a little absurd, but this is still a great movie with great music.  Robert Preston should have been nominated for an Academy Award.  Shirley Jones was a beautiful young woman with a great voice.  And even though I saw this when it was released in theatres &#34;back in the day&#34;, it is still a great movie to watch, and own.
B008VBYN80|3.0|The game has an energy system that I don't like. We should be able to do anything we want. Some of the quests cost diamonds, and that can cost money. This game would be great without the energy meter, and the greed for our money.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I decided to read this book when I saw trailers fir it .  I couldn't put it down. Told from the perspective of Father Death, the grim reaper, a story of many souls is retold replayed as he unveils Nazi Germany.  War is an ugly truth, but the words are vivid and alive.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Exciting, smart and fun to read. Defintely a sci-fi classic. I wish I had read it earlier but glad it was in my summer list.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|i enjoyed placing it. but just recently it has started putting an ad before you play and you cant exit out. it is really annoying. I wish they would fix it
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, I thought it was a fairly fast and easy read but definitely a different writing style, much like a movie.  The ending was a twist I never saw coming which also made me quite sad too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is very classy and keeps you interested.  The history of the series is very enlightening.<br />I love watching the way separation of the classes were handles in those days.  ( rich and poor)
B004TN7QPG|5.0|It does  exactly what I wanted it to do.It is the best.I will recommend this for any one who need a good reader
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This has been one of the very few games that I have found myself playing over &amp; over again.  Yes,after excessive play titime I have over done it but after some time away I am back at it.  Each level is different with the same main objective.  As you get into the higher levels there are more obstacles increasing the difficulty.  When you play you have to find diamonds for extra points.  You don't need them to complete the game but it's fun to go back &amp; find them all.  There's also quick plays with a single objective during a specific time frame.<br /><br />I didn't have to be signed in to Amazon or connected to the internet to play.  I did have to to be able to download the game initially as with everyone else.  DUH!  As well, I have never o crap received a notification from this app so I don't believe the single review that says it.  I bet my life that they had another app installed that is spamming them.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter never fails. I love this series. Cant wait for the next one. Too bad it is all coming to an end sood.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I downloaded this app as the FAOTD promotion.  I was so excited to have this app.  I thought I got something special.  After all, the FAOTD are the paid versions for free to be downloaded that day.  Not when it comes to PLAYFIRST!  I had the entire version for a shotry period of time &amp; after an update I now have the demo version that everyone &amp; anyone can get anytime.  I don't understand why Amazon would allow this....  well Amazon is shady as all can be too so I am sure they received a nice kick back.  It's just the same as the apps that are free then suddenly an outrageous price then added as the FAOTD so everyone thinks they're getting a $5 app for free when the app was free all along.  Why PLAYFIRST would get involved in such a scam I don't know but if they're willing to do this then they obviously are willing to scam all their customers so think twice before allowing them to access your devices!  I am willing to bet they're selling your info to anyone willing to pay for it.  This junk is being uninstalled now that I see them for who they really are.  Good luck people!

B005DOL0R0|5.0|I got one of these (in blue) for myself when I got my Kindle Fire over a year ago.  I think so highly of it that I got this one for my step-dad when he got one just recently.  While I'm not a fan of the lime green lining inside the grey sleeve, color doesn't impact just how wonderful a job this product does at keeping the Kindle Fire safe and protected.  I'd highly suggest this to anyone who will be taking their Kindle Fire anywhere... be it across town, or across the country.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|I was dying in anticipation for the Blu-ray release so i bought this to listen to in the car prior to.  It helped ease my anxiety because it is so awesome.  When I finally got the film, I felt even more connected with it.  Love the movie.  Love the soundtrack.  Baz Lurhman is a genius and Leonardo DiCaprio is a dream.
B001NERPHS|3.0|\\"The Basement Tapes\\", a double album from 1975, was the first official release of recordings made by Bob Dylan and the Band in 1967, eight years previously.  This double album is heavily flawed from a historical perspective, for reasons I will go to in depth in this review.  The sessions were well known and eagerly anticipated, largely due to Dylan's status in the rock culture.  Very few musicians are as heavily mythologized, academically analyzed, or held up as one of the great movers and shakers of rock and roll as Bob Dylan.  The Beatles are one.  Elvis Presley is another, although he is more an industry unto himself than a musician bearing the same weight in a strictly academic, university setting.<br /><br />In terms of Dylan's career, the recordings do feel fill in the missing link between the cerebral, wildly surreal, acid drenched \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and earthy, brown, extremely streamlined and economical songwriting approach used in the 1967 album \\"John Wesley Harding\\", which differed so drastically from the wild garage rock and Beatnik writing of his three pre-motorcycle crash albums of 1965-1966. John Wesley Harding\\" is arguably a founding document and a progenitor of Alt Country ushering in a roots rock musical approach that would command such force in the late 1960s, moving away from psychedelic song-craft, and represented a great divide not only in 1967 (the year of Sgt. Pepper and Their Satanic Majesties Request), but also Dylan's own studio ouever.<br /><br />\\"The Basement Tapes\\" are essentially several hours of recordings made on home equipment in the basement (hence the name) of Big Pink that Dylan made with the band in 1967, after the 1966 motorcycle crash.  These sessions were never meant for commercial consumption. In December 1967 (several months after he had finished recording \\"The Basement Tapes\\" with The Band), Dylan released his first studio album entitled \\"John Wesley Harding\\" since the epoch-making double album, \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", which was rock's first double album.  However, none of the twelve songs were known to be recorded during \\"The Basement Tapes\\".<br /><br />Over the years, people have called for a Basement Tapes Bootleg Series installment.  While such an archival release is inevitable, we must be realistic: a lot of these recordings are very brief, fragmented, and commercially not viable for a mainstream release, so I don't think we will ever see them all released.  After all, the recordings were not done in the premier conditions.  Also, don't be surprised if Dylan and his management have some aces up their sleeves when it comes time to do a Bootleg installment of this material.  Until the release of \\"Another Self Portrait\\", NO ONE publically, and I mean NO ONE, knew that \\"Minstrel Boy\\" originated during the Basement Tapes era, let alone that a BT recording even existed!  From a recording sessions perspective is the single biggest revelation yet unveiled in \\"The Bootleg Series\\".  There are some other known songs that aren't circulating, including some legitimate Band songs and at least two Dylan songs, one called \\"Wild Wolf\\" whose lyrics were published in the 1986 book \\"Some Other Kinds Of Songs\\" and one about going up and down stairs.<br /><br />In 1968, Rolling Stone ran an article on the unreleased sessions, calling them Dylan's lost album and did a track-by-track analysis of the material that they knew about.  What they were referring too was a fourteen song acetate* that Albert Grossman (Dylan's manager) began shopping around his contacts in the music industry of the new songs Dylan had written with The Band.  Beginning in 1967, several major acts began recording these new songs and scoring commercial success, which is how the acetate came to the attention of the rock journalist industry. **<br /><br />Traditionally, most Dylan aficionados will refer you to \\"A Tree With Roots\\", a four disk bootleg that encompasses all known recordings currently in circulation.  As far as the researchers can ascertain, \\"A Tree With Roots\\" is arranged chronologically.  The first two disks are largely cover songs from a wide variety of musicians, and the last two disks are the originals Dylan began writing at that time.<br /><br />The rock press and Dylan's rabid fanbase has assigned complex \\"mythological\\" meanings to these sessions, chief among them that Dylan was taping into the great American zeitgiest as defined by Harry Smith's famed \\"Anthology of American Folk Music\\", perfectly exemplifying that \\"Old, Weird America\\" as found in pre-rock musical traditions that so defined Dylan's song-writing ethos.  Greil Marcus wrote a rather rambling, often times incomprehensible 1997 book by that very title, exclusively devoted to \\"The Basement Tapes\\", along with extensive notes and source information for over the 100 recordings on \\"A Tree With Roots\\".<br /><br />All in all, Marcus's reading is a pretty complex reading of sessions that were never even meant to be released, let alone endlessly studied by the fanbase and self-important rock critics.  Equally interesting is that at the time of Marcus's book, roughly eighty percent of the material was (and, as of Fall 2013, still is) commercially unreleased, though widely available via bootleg and the Internet.<br /><br />So what does all this backstory have to do with the 1975 compilation?  Several things, and not all of them good.  The most defining (and frustrating) facet of the official release is there is a bit of sleight-of-hand going on.<br /><br />First, as well noted, the 1975 official album features EIGHT Band tracks that were all recorded Post 1967, and are not original to the sessions.  According to Robbie Robertson, The Band's guitarist, these songs, while not themselves strictly from the sessions proper, fit well into the lo-fi intrigue and musica feels and had thematic unity with the material recorded in Big Pink in 1967.  While such an argument can be made***, bottom line is that these eight recordings did notbelong at all and served little more than to push Robertson's own ego, with the rest of The Band taking a strangely silent approach to the release.  Some work and overdubs were being down on The Band songs as late as 1974.<br /><br />Secondly, \\"The Basement Tapes\\" was the first indication that were a lot more to the tapes than we knew about pre-1975.  The 1975 released featured 16 genuine Basement Tape recordings, comprising twelve of the original songs from the acetate, along with four new recordings which were completely unknown (these being \\"Odds and Ends\\", \\"Going to Acapulco \\", \\"Clothes Line Sage\\", \\"Apple Sucking Tree\\").  Of these four recordings, \\"Going to Acapulco\\" was (rightfully) haled as a major revelation about the artistry of Dylan and The Band during 1967.<br /><br />Third, there were three omissions from the fourteen song acetate.  Columbia released Take 1 of \\"Too Much of Nothing\\" instead of the more well-known second take on the acetate (personally, I far prefer the second take).  We then have two simply STRANGE omissions, on the level of withholding \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" from the 1983 \\"Infidels\\" and \\"Girl from the Red River Shore\\" on the 1997 \\"Time Out of Mind LP\\".  They did not include \\"Quinn the Eskimo\\" and \\"I Shall Be Released\\".  Oddly, an Eskimo even appears on the cover, which is supposed to represent several different characters from Bob's songwriting.<br /><br />Please understand, these two songs are NOT minor omissions.  Both were massive hits and incredibly famous, and in the ensuing years, \\"I Shall Be Released\\" has become not only one of the most famous songs from the Basement Tapes era, but also one of Dylan's most renowned in general, which is saying a lot given the tremendous pedigree of his song-writing canon.  Dylan would not release the Basement Tapes recording of \\"I Shall Be Released\\", one of his most famous songs, until a staggering twenty four years later, on the 1991 \\"The Bootleg Series Vol 1-3\\".  He did re-record three Basement Tapes songs in 1971 and included them in \\"Greatest Hits Vol 2\\" (these being \\"Crash On The Levee (Down In The Flood)\\". \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere\\". and \\"I Shall Be Released\\").  He also released a live rendition of \\"Quinn the Eskimo\\" form the 1969 Isle of Wight concernt on the critically panned 1970 double LP, \\"Self Portrait\\".<br /><br />All in all, five other recordings have been released as of 2013: \\"Quinn the Might Eskimo\\" on the 1985 boxset \\"Biograph\\" and in 2000 on \\"The Essential Bob Dylan\\", the afreomentioned \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and \\"Santa Fe\\" on \\"Bootleg Series 1-3\\", \\"I'm Not There\\" on the 2007 soundtrack to the film of the same name, and \\"Minstrel Boy\\" on \\"Bootleg Series 10\\".<br /><br />Fourth, as more material has become available in the intervening years, the 1975 compilation appears more and more lacking for the sheer amount of worthwhile songs simply unavailable, including some defining songs and undeniable highlights that have long been noticeably lacking official release.  These songs include several unreleased covers and key tracks (such as \\"Sign on the Cross\\" and probably the most highly regarded outtake of Dylan's career, \\"I'm Not There (1957)\\".  There were some Johnny Cash covers (\\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"Belchazaar) that are fantastic.  The lack of covers lack representation on what was really happening at Big Pink.  \\"Young But Daily Growin'' and 'The Banks Of The Royal Canal\\" were on the master reels for official release but did not make the final cut.<br /><br />Fifth, and this has always bugged me (The Red Album from The Beatles, and several other older releases, have the same problem), although a double album in the vinyl days, the 1975 release is just under 77 minutes long, which could easily have fit on a single CD.  Instead, Columbia makes you pay for two disks.  Dylan's \\"Greatest Hits Vol 2\\" also has the same problem.<br /><br />On August 27th, 2013, Dylan released \\"Another Self-Portrait,\\" too which I wrote a long, protracted essay.  Someone responding to that review said that it felt rather ridiculous I would have composed such a long review over what was essentially an archival release from one of his most critically despised albums and felt my review was disproportionate to the actual compilation of outtakes.<br /><br />The point this person was trying to make was that it appears every single album/project Dylan does gets a scrutiny simply not there for so many others, and he cited \\"The Basement Tapes\\" as an example.  According to this person Dylan simply wanted to be a song and dance man, and not the second coming (or third or fourth, who's counting?) so many people want him to be.  While his fanbase may contribute any number of wild theories to his music, sometimes I think we overanalyse Bob.  When he heard that the 1975 release was doing well, he was surprised: he thought everyone had them by that point.  That tells you that Bob keeps moving forward, and while we may assign different mythic meanings to different eras in his career, often times Bob is simply making the music he wants to make from his own artistic skill, and not channeling an \\"Old, Weird America\\" or any other such abstract nonsense!<br /><br />For all the flaws of the original 1975 release, sometimes we get so lost in all the legend and backstory that we fail to concentrate on the music itself as simply that: music.  While widely imperfect, regardless the 1975 \\"The Basement Tapes\\" features a key period in Dylan's musical evolution.  But for once, and this is hard, put all your preconceived notions of the mythology of the Basement Tapes away, and instead just focus on the music.  There's some great stuff there! And throw away Greil's book, at least for a little while! :)<br /><br />(As far as the 1975 original release and the 2009 remaster, there's not too much difference, as these recordings very lo-fi to begin with!)<br />.<br />.<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />*The 14 Song Acetate:<br /><br />1.

Ian & Sylvia, also managed by Grossman, recorded \\"Tears of Rage\\", \\"Quinn the Eskimo\\" and \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\".  In January 1968, Manfred Mann reached number one on the UK pop chart with their recording of \\"The Mighty Quinn\\".  In April, \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\", recorded by Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity, hit number five on the UK chart.  That same month, a version of \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\" by The Byrds was issued as a single. Along with \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\", it appeared on their country-rock album Sweetheart of the Rodeo, released in August.  The Hawks, officially renamed The Band, recorded \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\", \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and \\"Tears of Rage\\" for their debut album, \\"Music from Big Pink\\", released in July 1968. Fairport Convention covered \\"Million Dollar Bash\\" on their 1969 album \\"Unhalfbricking\\".\\"<br />.<br />.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />***In 2001, I wrote an extensive review about \\"The Basement Tapes\\", arguing that essentially the two disk 1975 double album, while flawed from a strictly historical, archival standpoint, flowed together wonderfully as a celebration of that \\"Old, Weird America\\" that Greil Marcus wrote about.  While I still think the argument is valid, there is certainly a very real, almost tangible frustration with the way Dylan's management (and probably Dylan himself) handled that release as evidenced by my already extensive review from 2013.  At risk of already extending the breathtaking length of this published review, I am including my original 2001 text as bonus content, with the understanding that I no longer hold these views, but I still think it's a compelling alternate view to of the official album.<br /><br />Original Review: September 26, 2001 \\"Historical criteria murders this otherwise flawless album\\"<br /><br />\\"The Basement Tapes' central problem, and here I speak of the official, double disc 1975 album is presentation. If the reader will read very many of these reviews he/she will keep coming to those who talk about the historical inaccuracy of this record and why, with so much (still unreleased) music in the vaults, it only makes this album all the more flawed. I will not go into detail on the historical inaccuracies other than what is immediately relevant to my own review as other reviewers have covered this topic quite thoroughly (given the review word limit). Alexander G. Lynn's review (7-1-01) is an excellent introduction into the various historical inaccuracies.<br /><br />Essentially, the eight Band songs present are not legitimate but recorded later by The Band. The commonly agreed reason (well backed with evidence) is Robbie Robertson's ego. Historically this release paints The Band as being nearly as active during as Dylan, which simply isn't true. Dylan was the clear domineering force in the sessions, although that should not alone be reason enough to discount the worthwhile contributions that The Band brings to these recordings. Dylan and The Band fed off each other's energy.<br /><br />My main gripe with the presentation of \\"The Basement Tapes is this blatant deception by Robertson, for the unimportant reason of feeding his own ego, totally throws this otherwise flawless album into the gutter simply because it entails all the wrong criteria to judge this work. From a historical viewpoint, this record needs an incredible amount of work. Eight tracks passing for \\"The Basement Tapes when they were not even recorded at the sessions do indeed have no business here (from the historical standpoint, that is, though not necessarily a musical, ascetic standpoint). Not only that, these eight tracks were made to sound lo-fi to fit more into the official release. It is bad enough to include tracks not recorded at the sessions, but to tamper with them makes it even worst.<br /><br />We now come to the crux of the matter: the wrong criteria (from an ascetic point of view) is used (and must be, because of the method of presentation) in judging this work. With the release of \\"The Basement Tapes, everyone came at this work from a historical vantage point. This is still prevalent, and it is not unreasonable. Because this criteria is used, \\"The Basement Tapes are often viewed as deceptive and a botched opportunity (which, again, this release is indeed guilty of historically). To be fair, it would have been unprecedented for Columbia to release the complete Basement Tapes recordings. The five CD-set, with the extended time length unavailable to vinyl records, would be a massive set unparalleled with anything else in 1975. Box sets were not established as commercially viable until the mid to late 1980s with the publication of Dylan's BIOGRAPH and Clapton's CROSSROADS. This is important facet for my view of this album, because without this facet the view I am about to state would be damnably undermined.<br /><br />If you strip this album away from the mindset of \\"This is \\"The Basement Tapes,\\" and instead approach it with \\"This is Dylan and The Band reinventing Americana,\\" suddenly the problems with this album just melt away. All of the music here is brilliant, including the eight Band songs.<br /><br />What would make this album a success would be had it been released not as \\"The Basement Tapes, but a double album utilizing parts of \\"The Basement Tapes and Band songs that had not been officially released to give us a chronicle of their reinvention of Americana. From that standpoint, this album becomes an absolutely smashing success. Had this approach been adopted, the historical inaccuracy would not exist for the fact there were songs included that were not Basement Tapes would simply not be an issue because they were not being presented as Basement Tape tracks.<br /><br />The reason why the establishment of Box Sets had not been included was because there would be the very reasonable question of WHY didn't they just release all of them? My answer, had it been presented properly, would be they found an official reason to release the songs. As it stands, the entire body of recorded Basement Tapes songs give us the same feeling: this is Americana at it's wildest, weirdest, and, oddly, most modern, yet because of the fact that had not been established, instead they give us this double album.<br /><br />If this was presented as a study in Americana, this would be fully appreciated as the wonderful album it is. In his 2001 release \\"Love and Theft\\"*, Dylan does much the same with taking old musical traditions, letting them retain their traditional feel to it, yet giving us uniquely modern music based on traditional song structures and breathing new life into them. The reason \\"The Basement Tapes are so famous is because Dylan does the same here*. In a time when psychedelic was at its most prominent, Dylan and The Band was recording music that were at great odds with the musical community. CCR is the only comparable band during this time frame that engaged in the same sort of musical rebellion, and although they have a string of must-have albums, they do not reach the brilliance here. Their music was recorded for release whilst this was not.<br /><br />Another thing this ascetic way of approaching this album has going for it, while historically a travesty, the eight Band tracks provides a context for Dylan's wild and extremely loose approach to these sessions, as AMG points out.<br /><br />Bottom line: From a historical viewpoint, a botched opportunity. From the viewpoint of a study in Americana, this stands as one of the best albums ever issued. ...Dylan synthesized older traditions into music for our day and age. ... Dylan could not have accomplished this without burying himself in traditional songs and the older music of an era long ago. \\"The Basement Tapes of the 1960s and \\"Love and Theft\\" of 2001 have so much resonance because of Dylan's presentation of the older style of music in a distinctly modern approach, creating a tension that would not otherwise be there.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I have never read anything else by Lehane but will definitely do so now.  Drawn to it because I loved the movie, but novel was almost impossible to improve upon in film.  Pacing and dialogue were intense at face value, but still leave enough ambiguity- even by the end- to make you question the trajectory of the story.<br />It's getting harder and harder to find writers in this genre that combine literary talent with the guts to write sparsely enough to keep the intensity level high.  Lehane seems like a rare author up to the task.

Its an easy to read narrative of this one man's life being born and raised in a gulag, and  it is something I will not soon forget.  Why aren't these human rights abuses more widely known?  I don't know the answer to that, but I would recommend this book to everyone.

B00EOO55GW|5.0|With \\"Hail to the King\\" A7X has fully embraced the styles of their classic metal predecessors and written a love letter to them. I was a teen in the '80's and I remember how much I loved that music. A7X encapsulates the best from that era, with obvious influences like Dio, Judas Priest, Dokken, Sabbath et al. That era was marked by songs that were noticeably less intricate and complex than what A7X has put out in their post metalcore releases, and this album reflects that, which admittedly turned me off at first. But once I accepted the album for what it is, I came to realize just what a fantastic job the gang did with each song. If you're not too disappointed that the songs lack the complexity and layers of releases like City of Evil and Nightmare, you ought to love it too.

I was not ready to accept Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, but the movies were so good that I became a big fan again. This movie is a trainwreck. It is a complete departure from the spirit and essence of the Jason Bourne character, who although being a highly trained elite person, was nonetheless intensely human. Like so many movies, it seems the film-by-committee boys and girls stripped the film of all that is worthy, extracted the action scenes, and left the depth, character development, narrative and nuance in the trashbin.<br /><br />I believe this film probably killed the Bourne franchise, unless they realize how much they screwed it up.

0062206281|3.0|\\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" is the third book in Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's loosely connected series about The Cemetery of Forgotten Books, and takes place after the events of both \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" and \\"The Angel's Game\\".  In it, the author returns his focus to his original protagonists, Daniel Sempere and Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres (\\"Shadow...\\"), and away from the doomed writer David Mart&iacute;n (\\"Angel's...\\").  In length - and in comparison to the other books - it is more properly a novella than a novel, and it serves less as an equal partner in the series than as a lengthy epilogue to the first installments and/or a potential bridge to future and more fully-formed works.<br /><br />\\"Prisoner...\\" provides additional backstory for Ferm&iacute;n and David Mart&iacute;n, gives us a glimpse into the married life of Daniel and Bea, and provides insight into the nagging question from \\"Angel's...\\" - is The Boss supernatural, or did Mart&iacute;n descend into madness?  (Although there still appears to be some hedging on the subject.)  It also introduces a new potential villain, the whiff of a plot centered on Daniel and his wife, and draws a connection between him and Mart&iacute;n.<br /><br />Given the open-endedness of \\"Angel's...\\" all of this is welcome, but it is also frustrating.  There is little depth here - the book reads at a much quicker pace than the others - new plot elements are left unresolved, and the author's usually beautiful and deeply evocative prose is largely replaced by much more straightforward writing.  On the whole, \\"Prisoner...\\" feels like the first half of a Zaf&oacute;n novel or as if he has perhaps grown tired of these characters and whipped off a not-quite-completed coda for \\"Shadow...\\" and \\"Angel's...\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm glad I read it for the resolution it provided.  The writing pales in comparison to the first two books, and the plot was far less compelling or involving, but interestingly, I found that it helped me appreciate \\"Angel's...\\" more, as it framed the role of that book in the arc of stories the author has built so far.  Hopefully, the next book that orbits The Cemetery of Forgotten Books, if there is one, will be a more worthy successor to \\"Shadow of the Wind\\".<br /><br />(NOTE: If Amazon would allow half stars, I would give this three-and-a-half.)role of that book in the arc of stories the author has built so far.

B00E8JZILA|4.0|To preface this, I've started playing The Walking Dead on both iPad and Xbox, and didn't make it past the first chapter on either system. Not because the game is bad (it's fantastic! Play it, play it now!), but because the control scheme on both devices is heavily flawed. On iPad, the touch controls are great for interacting with the environment, but terrible for moving your character around the screen. On Xbox, the controller is fantastic for moving your character around the screen (and looking about), but horrible for interacting with the environment.<br /><br />So I was highly excited when I heard the Vita offered both control schemes, because it sounded like I could take the best of both worlds! However, this is not the case. When you start a new game you get to choose whether you will use the device controls or the touchscreen. The only concession is that when using the touch controls, you can use the left stick to move your character around (but for panning the scene around, you still have to use the awkward touch-and-drag). I really wish that they had instead developed a hybrid approach where you can choose how to control the game as you play without needing to worry about choosing one control scheme and being stuck with it. Oh, well.<br /><br />On the plus side, the game is fantastic (and being able to use the thumbstick to move around while sticking with touch controls is at least better than the iPad). Highly recommended, but don't expect a panacea when it comes to the control scheme if you have been disgusted with controlling the game on other platforms. Note, too, that the 400 Days content is included in the game, so no DLC (unlike previous platforms)! That was a very nice touch.<br /><br />Basically, this is a five star game with a three star control scheme. Probably the best platform for this one is the computer (although I haven't tried it there, it seems like a mouse and keyboard are how this game was designed to be accessed).<br /><br />One last note: if you want to switch between the control schemes, you can do so by toggling the touch controls on and off from the settings; however, this option only shows up if you back out all the way to the main menu. You can't swap between the two while in game, so make sure to get to a checkpoint before you try experimenting.e: if you want to switch between the control schemes, you can do so by toggling the touch controls on and off from the settings; however, this option only shows up if you back out all the way to the main menu.

People who want to recall their memories of WWII, and for those that want to learn of WW II, while reading a well written story of love warped by the consequences of War will find it hard to put this book down after they start the first paragraph.

B0000057C5|5.0|After listening to Rammstein's debut album Herzeleid, I was almost expecting Sehnsucht to fall short in comparison, I was definitely wrong! Once again Rammstein's unique sound comes through in this album. There is quite a bit more use of synthesizers and keyboards in Sehnsucht, but that is definitely not a bad thing, the use of these instruments makes all the songs on this album sound so innovative (despite having been used perfectly on Herzeleid already).<br /><br />The songs on Sehnsucht are: Sehnsucht, engel (featuring German pop singer Bobo), tier, bestrafe mich, du hast,  b&uuml;ck dich, spiel mit mir, klavier, alter mann, eifersucht and k&uuml;ss mich (fellfrosch). There are also 2 bonus tracks that are not listed on the back of the album, and they are the English versions of engel and du hast. Although some of the original meaning of the songs are lost in translation from German to English (which is a shame), I still think it is very cool to hear Till sing in English, and I believe these tracks are exclusive to the North American release of Sehnsucht.<br /><br />There is a great combination of songs on this album. Tracks such as sehnsucht, bestrafe mich and eifersucht are heavy songs that really bang. Other tracks like engel, du hast and b&uuml;ck dich start off much lighter and full of synthesizers, only to lead into heavy riffs and pounding drums. There is also a track called klavier which is very slow and somber, but it is extremely powerful, and I definitely recommend this song!<br /><br />If you are a fan of Rammstein's Herzeleid album and we were weary of buying Sehnsucht, don't be, it is an amazing follow up album for an amazing band!!

B00BEIYH6U|3.0|The first Kick-Ass film was a high-velocity, ultra-violent, comedo-drama about real people attempting to be superheroes. It had some riveting action sequences (most of them not for the squeamish), a deceptively straight-forward plot, and a pull-no-punches attitude towards what is often the gooey-sweet sentimentality that action hero flicks often have at their heart. The film was a success.<br /><br />Capitalizing off of that success, we have the sequel. As is a usual problem with follow-up films, they try to do way too much. In an attempt to either top the original or at least match whatever expectations it may have caused in the audience, the film ironically fails to do either, fumbling as it juggles far too many plot threads.<br /><br />Our story picks up several years after the original. Kick Ass has inspired whole legions of superhero wannabes, most of whom wander the streets ineffectually in their various, goofy outfits. They eventually face off against a villain whose name I can't type here, played by the embittered Chris, the well-to-do kid whose mafia dad was dispatched in the last film. Overall, you've got a general up-the-ante feel with the good and evil forces expanded exponentially.<br /><br />However, there's a whole lot of distracting elements thrown in to muddy the waters. You've got both Hit Girl and Kick Ass experiencing superhero angst, most of it propelled by their respective parental figures. You've got a dead-end sidetrack while Hit Girl tries to navigate the murky waters of high school popularity. You've got Chris screaming and moping as he gathers his band of baddies, with an equally dead-end sidetrack to his imprisoned uncle. Add in some fairly awkward jokes, action sequences that (on the whole) aren't quite as impressive as the first film, and deeply (deeply, deeply) schmaltzy dialogue about what it takes to be a superhero (apparently, all it takes is bravery), and you've got a film that feels scatterbrained and overly-sweet compared to its predecessor.<br /><br />While not without its charms and a few enjoyable moments, and also while not an overall disappointment, the flick nevertheless fails to really kick quite as much butt as the one that spawned it.predecessor.<br /><br />While not without its charms and a few enjoyable moments, and also while not an overall disappointment, the flick nevertheless fails to really kick quite as much butt as the one that spawned it.

B009AMANBA|5.0|The acting was superb,  The screenplay was complex with often minimal identification of the names of the historical characters being portrayed,  Thus, one should review their American History of the Civil War and relearn the names of the major players, i.e.  Cabinet members and Congressional leaders before viewing the film.<br />The after battle scenes were so vividly realistic that they verged on horrific.  Thus, I would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 18 years old due to the excruciatingly realistic portrayal of the brutality of war.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's just like temple run but with minions which is even better but I can never get that many coins
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|My sister found this movie to be really scary. I loved watching it although I myself didn't find it to be extremely scary. But purchase,delivery was not a problem.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Cute summer pictures.  Great game.  The puzzle shapes are summer images, as well as the individual tiles.  This is a fun game.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I like the game, but it no longer works after an update today.<br />wait for an update to the game.  hopefully they will fix it soon.  I took an update on 2013-8-31

B001ANYDAO|4.0|I was bored in a 4 hour Saturday morning class about technology management. I've heard about this book and was curious about it on why I was so popular. I found out after a few pages in. Mr. Gladwell grabs you instantly and never lets go until the last page. There's so much knowledge, one you've finished, it changes perspectives and opinions. It was a great ride and I'm looking forward to many more from Mr. Gladwell.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I would recommend this book to any one, but I find Stieg's book seem to get a bit slow about 1/4 the way through but then really get you in.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|I purchased 24 hour HD rental a few days after release. Few minutes into the movie, I noticed the aspect ratio was wrong. The picture is flattened out. I tried to change it on my plasma TV with no luck. It looked like a kung-fu flick you see on TV in the 80s on channel 5 Sunday mornings. I restarted the PS3 and it was still showing the wrong aspect ratio. I sent 2 complaints to Amazon and both replied with &#34;going to send to our technical team, will follow up.&#34; Well that was months and months ago and no follow ups. I requested a refund and no reply.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Like the last 2 of Steig,s  trilogy books it slow in one section, but then I just couldn't put it down<br />Alan
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|If you watched the second season of The Newsroom, the character Sloan Sabbith referred to this movie as a 200 million dollar bust yet Disney did not ask for a bail out from the tax payers. They took it on the chin and moved on, unlike the banks.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|This book was excellent.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end - A very good author.  Keep them coming please.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This just makes obvious suggestions. There is no miracle solving solutions in this.If you have played 50 levels already then this will teach you nothing new.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game was fun,but lacked long term playability.  Also, every time I exited I had to restart the level.  Decent for a free app.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|If you're looking for a good page turner that will take your mind off your daily stress, this Jack Reacher book will fit the bill. One of Child's better ones though the payoff cold have been better.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Absolutely loved it.  It was such an  eye opening  documentary. I recommended it to a ton of my friends  and  will purchase more copies.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I did not want it to end.  I felt like I was part of the crew at times.  Very good story and action!  I see why it was a hit series when on TV!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There were sad parts, but I liked all of it.  I couldn't watch the episodes fast enough.  It was well done.

B0058YPG1G|4.0|Giancarlo Esposito has a weirdly compact Bruce Lee body - always has - so now that he is older  - it feels like he is in disguise and that wiry guy is just PLAYING a middle aged man.  This season all my suspicions about Pinky and Brain are confirmed:  all the shaved heads represent slave labor at Auschwitz hence Jesse's appearance and persistent look of fear, Jesse and Walt's insistence that they will not work if the other is killed, Alberquerque with its barren landscape and low buildings is Auschwitz and YES! the Axis continues to be behind illicit drug activity worldwide.  Remember that Domingo's cousin was surnamed KOYAMA.<br /><br />Note the thin SEMITIC character who shrugs \\"it's a living\\" referring to his salvage business.  Get it?  SALVAGE work in the  Konzentrationslager, or KZ.<br /><br />And in Giancarlo's unforgettable scene at Casa Tranqillo, you will be reminded of Arnold Schwarzenegger in [[ASIN:B00005N5S5 The Terminator]].<br /><br />This show is instrumental in directing our attention or at least a glance at the Wikipedia page at Nazi-era nuke scientist Werner Heisenberg who PROBABLY had something to do with U-864 (Hitler's Last Deadly Secret). As impressive as Walter White's intellect is, Heisenberg was even smarter which means the British saved the world when they sank the U-Boat containing two Japanese scientists trained in Germany and the components for the A bomb headed for Japan.  So ... that's who we were up against.  Einstein wanted Heisenberg to get the Nobel for Physics - that tells you something.  It wasn't an easy war to end.
140006922X|5.0|Zealot, the Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth reads like a novel, but full of history and backed by the voluminous notes for each chapter.  We see a real man and his life, his humble beginnings, but his inspiration and drive come through. The book tells about the economic and political conditions of First Century Palestine under Roman occupation.  Many references are made to Old Testament prophecies regarding of the messiah, and how and why so many were yearning for Him to appear.  The clarification of historical personalities and misrepresentations of past events puts a new light on the conditions at the time. It also gives a new insight to Jesus the Man, and what led to his execution.<br />I heard of this book through a &#34;share&#34; on FaceBook referencing an interview of Reza Aslan on Fox News.  Aslan's rebuttal of the interviewer's questions that showed her true lack of information--obviously she'd not read the book! Made me want to read it. I am glad I did. But it is a must read for anyone who is interested in the evolution of Early Christianity--
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|It's The Beatles Help! and it sounds great. That's enough for me. I recently bought a bigger/better TV that I will set up after I move, so I don.t want to critique the PQ. I love the soundtrack on this disc. I hope to give this a proper review later when I'm relocated.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|A new game for me, a bit of a mind worker. Really is quite fun, my 13 yr old grandaughter<br />loves to play it when she is over.  Some of the levels are quite tuff.  Simple set up but really<br />a thinker on some levels.  I enjoy it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is fun.  I like to play it a lot. You may enjoy it too.  You should buy it.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|just started watching this, am half way threw first disk and LOVE it as much as first two seasons . I dont get this show on tv here,dont have cable so can only watch on dvd. I love this series
B00ELIKDXG|4.0|Gousseva's characters embark upon a half-Narnian, half Russian adventure that is perfect for reading out loud to children, and entertaining enough that they'd want to read it by themselves. She has a sweet, brilliant voice and lively characters.

B00BSBUZPK|4.0|This documentary is fantastic, very well put together, and if you are even remotely a fan of this group it is worth the expense. I do have an issue with it, however, and if you intend to purchase this product you may wish to be aware of it.<br /><br />The first two discs are superb; SIX stars. The third one is simply not up to that standard, however. It is a recording of a concert in Maryland recorded during the Hotel California tour back in the 70's. The group is great, sounds very good, and they had several cameras set up, so you got to see what was going on over the whole stage. Great. But -- here you go folks -- THEY DON'T GIVE YOU THE WHOLE SHOW! There are only a few cuts from Hotel California, then a few of the oldies, and suddenly Frey is singing \\"Take it Easy\\" and saying good night to the crowd!! If they had done that for the crowd in Maryland there would have been violence! Really, when that disc ended I immediately said, aloud, \\"Frey... Henley... Azamoff...!!!\\" What the you-know-what, you know?! And I wanted the whole show not only because I love this group, but because the OTHER discs were very thorough and detailed, particularly the first one. When the whole experience was over I reflected upon that third disc as almost the equivalent of a bonus track from a CD, which are rarely good. Ya coulda done better, guys!
0143036424|3.0|I liked the Indian friend of Walt's the best of the characters in the book. Most of his observations of life made me smile. Only one slip up by author where Indian character spoke with a contraction when &#34;Walt&#34; said his friend never spoke a contraction, but said every word, Walt finally grew on me, but it took about half the book because I kept trying to replace the written word with the series Robert Taylor persona. It was like putting a square peg in a round hole. I don't plan on buying anymore of the books as the &#34;Series Walt&#34; is etched in my brain..

B002G1YPH0|5.0|One arm tied behind it's back? What???<br /><br />I am using the supplied fan on this unit and it is keeping my A8-5600K APU/CPU a cool 30 degrees Celsius. When I put a BIG load on it the max is usually 45 to 48 degrees. Once I got it up to 52 degrees. It won't go over that with this thing on it.<br /><br />You can install another fan on the other side. It comes with one. You have to buy the other. The brackets to mount the second fan are included in this box.<br /><br />THIS THING WILL MOST LIKELY SLIDE AROUND YOUR CPU!!!<br /><br />This is actually normal. Don't FrEaK OuT!!!!<br /><br />It uses technology to push this thing down on your CPU. The tech is not adjustable by you. This is on purpose. Have you ever turned a bolt or a screw until it broke off? Imagine doing that to your CPU. Turning it down until it CRACKS in half!!! That is why this thing handles how hard it pushes on your CPU. You turn the screws. They can only go so far into the holes provided. It stops and feels short. But they are spring loaded. So it is pushing on your CPU with a lot of force. Plenty enough to spread your thermal paste without bubbles and come in plenty of contact to whisk away heat, yet not damage your CPU.<br /><br />So when you clip the fan back on you will notice this thing shift a millimeter this way or that way. And you will want to turn the screws another turn... but they are already tight. It is normal. You will set this on your desk. It will be clamping down on your CPU. You will have a cold CPU. Life will be good. Right after you freak out a little.<br /><br />It comes with thermal paste. You don't have to buy any. Thermal paste is like HDMI cables... You can buy a Monster HDMI cable for $140 and it won't work any better than a $6 cable. You can buy $25 thermal paste and it won't work any better than the free one that comes with this product. It is just the way it is.<br /><br />Thermal paste goes a LONG way. Don't slather a ton all over your CPU. See the ZERO on your keyboard? That is a lot of paste! A dab that big is a lot. Only use that much if the metal on your CPU goes from one side to the other. Otherwise if your CPU has metal only on about half of the top you should use a dab the size of the minus sign.<br /><br />There are two types of CPU installers. One that swears by leaving a bead and letting it spread out as the heat sink gets ratcheted down, and the other guys who like to spread it out first. This product comes with a brown piece of firmly folded paper. It is for spreading the paste. Start in the center of the bead and pull some out, then the opposite way. Then again to the other two sides. It doesn't have to cover the entire CPU! When you ratchet down the heat sink turning 1 screw three cranks, then the opposite screw 3 cranks, then the 3 screw three times, and the fourth, and back to the first, second, third, fourth, and back again and again, it will slowly spread (squeeze) the paste across the entire CPU. You will see tiny beads of it getting smashed out on the side of the CPU.<br /><br />Make SURE you have a big enough case! I ditched my tiny Dell case for the Nzxt Technologies USB 3.0 Tempest 410 Steel Mid Tower Airflow Case and it fit with about an inch to spare from the side panel. You want to have a case that is 7 1/2 inches MINIMUM in depth. The case I bought was 8 inches. It fits nicely.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This works very well. No issues so far. Seems sturdy and strong. We use it for the kids-- a mini television. They seem to like it.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|As far as CPU's go the AMD A8-5600K is perfect when you need high speed for a great price.<br /><br />I went to those sites with lists of winflops or whatever they are called looking for a CPU that could outperform my old one and cost around $100. I found this one to be high on the list for the lowest price.<br /><br />This thing speed steps to save you money. If you are taxing it the computer runs at 3.8 Ghz... hey! Wait! I think my motherboard is running this thing .2 Ghz higher than normal. It is keeping a cool 30 degrees Celsius so no complaints! But when I am not doing anything it runs at 1.4 Ghz to save mad cash on the electric bill.<br /><br />I have it paired with an MSI motherboard that had 1 HDMI, 1 DVI and 1 VGA port. I used an HDMI to DVI cable to have this run my dual monitors that both have DVI inputs. It is working sweet. So good in fact that I sold my video card for $100. So it paid for my CPU!<br /><br />I love you Amazon!

B00CATSONE|5.0|This is not just a short bio of a 'Great Inventor'.  It is an inspiring story of an incredibly creative and curious mind and an in depth look at how such minds work to achieve such heights of inventiveness.  It is also the story of a good man, who despite every event imaginable that could have thwarted him on his path, remained steadfast and honest.  This book should be required reading in every school because it is sheer inspiration.

140006922X|4.0|As an ex-Christian I still had an interest in the central character of one of the world's major religions. Was he real? It seems the only historic reference we have is from Josephus, the first-century Jewish historian, who mentions him only as the brother of James and the one they \\"called messiah.\\" Hardly a concrete testimony to his life, but it does support the belief that he did exist. But all the other things about Jesus must be speculation, the best educated guesses based on the historical references to the social environment of that time and place. The best we can conclude is that Jesus was illiterate, for where would the son of a carpenter in a small, back-water town like Nazareth get schooling in anything but farming and the woodworking trade of his father? Again, we know practically nothing of the life of Jesus before he began his three-year ministry that led to his execution.<br /><br />So, those who fault Aslan for \\"not sticking to historical facts,\\"  or anything similar, are suggesting that historical \\"facts\\" exist that simply don't. The Gospels are not reliable as history, since they surfaced long after the death of Jesus, and seem to be written to promote the idea of Jesus being the prophesied Messiah.<br /><br />I don't accept everything that Aslan has written as infallible, but I enjoyed the book because it gave me a different look at the man called Jesus, a look that would seem to be reasonable and logical; and he writes this work almost as a work of fiction, in that I found myself turning the pages with interest. I do believe that Jesus was a zealous young rabbi who sought to reform the Judaism he believed in and defended, but was highly critical of the power of the priests of the Temple in Jerusalem.<br /><br />Even as a Christian I had always heard that Paul, or Saul of Tarsus, was the real founder of the religion we know as Christianity. Aslan gives me a more negative view of Paul, one who was promoting his own notion of who and what Jesus was, although he had never known him in life, and who denigrated the Laws of Moses and the Jewish traditions. Well, if he hadn't done so, Christianity would have remained a Jewish cult instead of the religion that eventually became the official faith of a failing Roman Empire.<br /><br />I would encourage anyone with an interest in Jesus the man, whether a believer or a skeptic, to read this book. I found the image of Jesus Aslan presents as eminently reasonable, though perhaps troubling to some close-minded Christian dogmatists.<br /><br />Aslan gives lots of notes, at the back of the book, for those who want to delve further into his conclusions and the basis for them. I was thinking of buying this book, but suddenly my local library got a copy of it, and I grabbed it and read it. I liked it, but I can't say that I \\"loved\\" it, so I would give it 4 stars in my brief review.lthough he had never known him in life, and who denigrated the Laws of Moses and the Jewish traditions.

B00AVPYT8I|4.0|I downloaded this at because I am a frequent reader. At first I thought I was wasting my time because a different app like this wouldn't work but it turns out I was wrong this app really works and I plan to download multiple books at a time and so I highly recommend that you download this app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is enjoyable to watch. There is drama and mystery without much violence. But mostle it's about the love of one family
0525478817|5.0|I finally got to read this book, and I had to make my sister and then my brother and then my friend read it. I cried, I laughed, I sobbed quietly in the middle of the night in order not to wake anyone.<br />Hazel's dad made me cry over and over. Hazel's dad is the best.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|the real version of games have been wanted on the kindle fire for a long time but yet there are those stupid useless nockoff games that arnt even close to the teak game. like clash of the clans and candy crush and so forth.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I like the information that is provided and easily accessible.  I also like how easy it is to get information on other cities.  Really findnthe Realtemp helpful, too.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I was so happy that my 3 year old loves this movie as much as I did.  My older children also enjoy this classic.  Thanks!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really loved this book. Kathleen Grissom really makes her characters come alive. Loved her style of using different points of view to tell the story.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This is really great app.... I just watched a Korean movie n they were playing a Korean song.... well Shazam listened to the music n it picked the movie n Scene from the movie... wow!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I loved this movie, but then I usually love anything with Bruce Willis. It had action, story line and as usual with Bruce it had comedy lines. All the stars were very good. My husband and I both enoyed it. Haven't seen Red II  yet , but I am planning to soon.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|They went back to being angry,  tempo and the rifts, great songs and the cover of this CD very cool
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I did not think I would like this movie but I did. It tells how Oz  came to be Oz the Great. The story was entertaining and the costumes and makeup was very good.It probably would be too much for small children the witches and special effects could be too much for them.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham scores again! He presents a crazy plot with many twists and turns and does so in believable fashion.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, I liked the setting, the era, and the fact that more than one persons story was told. It contained some violence but I would say it would be ok for over 13 years old.It was well written and acted.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|This is a well-written story with more twists and turns than a roller coaster. My only critique would relate to how it ended. Definitely worth the read though!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|This is a rare film: a creepy scare film that is appealing to a broad audience - from tweens to adults. Low on gore and long on story, it's a good family choice. No, it isn't a classic, but it is a scary movie that's worth a view.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I was getting bored with candy crush it seems that game is geared to making additional lives purchases if this one doesn't go there it's far better.
1451626096|5.0|Philippa Gregory is one of my favorite authors and I love the way she presents her characters along with the historical background of her Cousins' War books.  You can follow the book as you watch the TV Series and don't miss a thing.  If you like history, you'll love the magic of this book.  It isn't a dull history but filled with excitement and personal feelings of the characters.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Love playing the game! Find myself playing until I win, but the app has too many ads. And they are mostly the same. They are not going to influence my purchase of anything.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I waited forever for this game to be free and now it is its so gooood it rocks I love it id give it a 100 star rating
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|With the buttons being bigger makes it easier when adding up transactions faster :-) does the job and works for me
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This seems to be a very fun to play game. Sometimes it is not very easy to find the object you need to find run out of energy too fast.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Zeptolab is a awesome developer, but this one just didn't  come out like Cut The Rope or Cut The Rope Experiments. I have both as well as this one. It is very very fun on the first and second world then on the third level it glitches a bit on the first level but I think it still is an amazing game. I love the fact that it's an HD app. I'm glad it does work on kindle fire 1 and 2 as well as the HD one.  I do still recommend this app for anyone who likes the Cut The Rope series. Thank you for reading this review.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Pirate Adventure is a great game. The dialogue can be annoying  at times, however, the puzzles more than make up it.  I recommend this game for hours of entertainment.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I haven't read novels in a ling time and I kinda stumbled into this one- Thank goodness I did. Green does an unreal job of creating characters, of exploring the nuances of human thought and emotions, all while dealing with the uncomfortableness of the C word. Truly worth a read!
B003U53GK8|3.0|Not as good as the middle seasons. Stop before Season 6. Seasons 3-5 are the best seasons available to watch.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's Pinterest. What's not to love? It's got food, cute animals, funny stuff, boobs, and nerdy s***. It's like reddit but with more recipes and less politics.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Story is exciting, interesting, funny, and keeps you guessing. Guest appearance of Ernest Borgnine a rate treat! Willis at one of his best.
B00EOO55GW|3.0|I must say, I've been a huge A7x fan since Waking The Fallen.<br />This was SUCH A disappointment.<br />There was no power at all.<br />Easily stated... It was weak.<br />The drums were plain and simple, something I wouldn't normally find in A7x songs.<br />Even in their slower songs, The Rev would do an amazing jobs on the drums.<br /><br />Now I won't say it was all bad.<br />Acid Rain and Requiem were my favorites.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Although this season wasn't as climactic as the previous season, it still had a few small surprises.  As usual, it depicts the dynamics of a law office in a very entertaining manner.
0811879542|5.0|I purchased this book for my then two year old son.  He loves this book and continues to read it even today as a six year old.  The pages are sweet and draw the reader into the simple process of what happens to dots when you touch, clap, blow, rub, tilt, etc. the book.  I have read it in preschool, kindergarten and first grade classes to the delight of students and teachers alike.  I have also purchased several more copies of it to give as gifts to teachers and baby gifts to new parents.  I love this book and am sure it can become a favorite in anyone's household.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Good human interest story of the average family caught in the malaise of taking life for granted when suddenly it all unravels.  Good family movie of the need to never give up in the face of adversity.
B005HED5YW|5.0|A great series for its time.  Revolutionary vision into the possibilities of what could be.  Can't understand why originally Amazon assigned it a TV-MA rating but I am glad to see that now it has a TV-PG rating.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I am updating this review - after having had more time to play with it. It DOES have a use - when you have a TV which is NOT network attached.  I have a computer monitor/TV - which does not have RJ45 or Wifi connections - SO having THIS device - allows me to hook up that TV - and spin off movies from various sources.  I have used it with Netflix, Hulu+, HBO-GO and Youtube.  You should go to wikipedia and check out the various products available for use with Chromecast.<br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />I opened the box, everything was there, hooked it up to my 29\\" Vizio Smart TV as well as an older dumb 26 inch Samsung Monitor/TV. Those two worked fine!  It failed to work with my 32 inch dumb Viewsonic TV.<br /><br />I Used my iPad to configure it - configuration worked fine. Software works fine.  Hardware works fine.  Great piece of engineering, great user interface.<br /><br />It isn't 'Bad', but for me - I don't use it all of the time.  Maybe, if I throw the dongle into my desk drawer - I will discover that in six months it will be really cool.  Maybe I will change my mind about Chromecast, and come back, and update. alter, improve this review.  (I did!)where SOME of my media is stashed.<br /><br />There IS a 4th item that it is supposed to do.  It is SUPPOSED to stream from Google Chrome to Chromecast.  I will assume that it probably does that just fine on a Windows laptop or desktop.  However, it does not appear to function with my iPad running IOS 6.1.4 with my Chrome Browser version 28.0.1500.16 (July 30, 2013).<br /><br />The PROMISE is that more and more content will be available. However, I suspect that anyone who competes with the Google Play revenue stream - may not be able to get their foot in the door.<br /><br />SO - I am into a dongle for $35, which really doesn't get me excited.  I have another 32 inch older ViewSonic TV which could use the 'hook' into Netflix, if I didn't already have a BlueRay player attached to it (which is smart, and has MANY MANY more data sources).<br /><br />It isn't 'Bad', but for me - it isn't useful at all.  Maybe, if I throw the dongle into my desk drawer - I will discover that in six months it will be really cool.  Maybe I will change my mind about Chromecast, and come back, and update. alter, improve this review.  Maybe not.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|My second favorite John Green book ( incidentally have you read Looking for Alaska?) Great read from a great author.
0316228583|4.0|I currently run my own book blog and you can check out my full review of the book here. All of my reviews are spoiler free, unless otherwise noted!  [...]
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Not only a great message but well stated. Terrific way to communicate the message. Entertaining writing that will uplift you and point you down the right road.
B0011OVCT2|1.0|Here's my last email to the vendor. I think it sums up my experience:<br /><br />You obviously didn't read my email. I have no intention of returning the DVD as it is not worth the effort to send back a $7 DVD (that's what I paid including shipping) for which I'm going to pay at least half that much in shipping. Not to mention the time and aggravation just to get it shipped. And by the way, I find your statement about it clearly stating Region 2 in the description to be frustrating. How would you expect the average consumer to know what that means. I'm a US customer purchasing a DVD from a US based company. It seems to me that your system would be sophisticated enough to recognize that. For that matter, Amazon should never have recommended the item to me in the first place knowing that I live in the US.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is very life like I love it a lot. The game is fun and affecting I could play for hours.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|As a true Treki, I think it's awesome, It brings back memories of Ricardo Montalbon(sp?) and the gang, Seti Alpha 5 or 6....I really don't remember or care! The special effects superb. For those of us who grew up with Shatner...Ya gotta like it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|App is just like the console.  Limited world. Still the minecraft you know and love though. Even more so with the updates.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|keep making levels fun for keeping your mind involved with great puzzles. great way to pass time and not boring
B00000J2PH|5.0|Again good quality for a used product. It brings me back to the '60's and my love of folk music.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Great season as a whole! The Doctor and the Ponds go up against some of the best villains the series has ever seen. And River Song will grow on you.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game has good content and a couple different ways to set up the controls which is nice but still a little awkward. Plays well on Kindle.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Good for boys and girls. You rescue both regular zoo animals and dinosaurs. Lots of fun without spending real money. Very little reading and easy learning curve. Appropriate for around age 8ish. Players collect coins when they breed, feed and shelter their animals.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|New to ebooks - wife tells me I read too much - Kindle now  makes it easier and cheaper.  She wont win.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so addictive and really hard to put down even when life tries to interrupt no chance I'm playing bingo blitz
0345803507|5.0|It was amazin i like it a lot because it was every thing i expected to read in a book
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Dracula holds up rather well, and reading through it, now I'd say well over a decade after having seen the film first which provided me with some good imagery of what was going on, am left also quite impressed at what the filmmakers did with this script. The beginning is quite scary, and the plot after has less of a love story than the movie as the book has much less of the vampire and more of its living characters, and though it is a good read, at a few points the momentum shows to a crawl, and the epic final confrontation at Dracula`s castle is just a blur. Also thank God for the kindle s included dictionary; there are some words in here that are quite...interesting...and certainly are not common in today's day and age. It's especially interesting how the book in its entirety is told through letters, notes, etc; no part of it happens live, and yet there is still some dead as to the outcome of some of the characters, especially as I had mentioned in the beginning. Dracula is dark, classy, well-written, and hey, it's also free...download it, and when you find yourself with some free time, go ahead and give it a chance, and see how the monster makers of today were inspired.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|This is one of the worst abortions Everton come out of Hollywood. I can not believe that anyone thought this was a good idea.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Do you like a dark, visual tale?<br />Do you like a storyteller who can paint pictures with his words?<br />Do you like the slightly weird and wonderful?<br />And what about Mr Dahl's stories?<br />Or Tim Burton's films?<br />If the answer to any, or some of these questions is 'yes', then read Mr O'Brien's book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The fabric of the lives in this story are woven together so beautifully that the years melt away before you know it. It ended too quickly.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|A review of the Fifth Witness - as always Michael Connolly with his Lincoln series  holds my interest to the very end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best series on TV!  Fantastic cast. Great storyline. Masterpiece-- keep them coming.  Can't wait for Season 4!
B00B9366VO|4.0|Great piece of history.. great insights into the artists, and very personal performances and insights. A good documentary piece with fun perspectives on the evolution of both music and quality sound, and the people that made it happen.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is good for every now and then. It's good once you start playing and if you like Smurfs or games like that you will probably like this one.....
B008NAFU9A|5.0|This is a fun short read, more of a teaser for the forever girl. It's the appetite when The Forever Girl is the first course of the meal. I'd a pretty condensed story, but that means it's a fast read. I read it in an afternoon and couldn't put it down. A good way to test the authors writing style before committing to the series.
B000FC2L1Y|3.0|Let me see if I understand about Ian. Jamie and Clair travel half-way around the world chasing after Ian in 'Voyager' fighting pirates, the English Navy, Voodoo followers and others.  Then, in this book, they just let Ian give himself to the Indians in exchange for Roger.  Just, goodby Ian, have a nice life as an Indian. Not a fight or attempt at rescue. It didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />Otherwise, I enjoyed reading this book although the story line was somewhat disjointed.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The first book in a series to come, The Forever Girl is about a young Wiccan woman (Sophia) who is trying to cure a curse from her family. In her efforts she meets Charles, a Strigoi (or shifter) who at first tries to protect her from his world but then it turns out she needs his help to learn more in order to deal with her curse and the history of her family. The characters are well drawn and the story is epic. Lots of twists and turns to keep me guessing, particularly toward the more action packed ending. Well written and edited. I want more!
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|A story with many emotions because as Americans we are sheltered from what really goes on in the lands of war. It was filled with tears of joy and sorrow throughout. I want to read more by Hosseini.
B00EDF43MY|1.0|not a smooth app. it is not so intuitive for beginner. the app might work on tap which has higher process performance
B007ZXQNGA|5.0|It's all very well to dream, but the practical, realistic and non-delusional detail that this book presents for consideration is what will help you achieve it. There are no ridiculous personality categorizations implying you might be unsuitable to do such a thing, but lots of good examples of successful businesses run by all sorts of people. The references he gives are also high quality.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Watched 2 out of the set already in a few days; just finished Wrath of Khan last night -- had never seen it and it helps explain some of the newer Star Trek movies. This is original, great, classic Star Trek; with compelling plots, good dialogue, unexpected twists & turns, etc. vs. relying on special effects, explosions & gun fights like so many modern movies. I hadn't seen some of the older ones though I watched many Star Trek series on TV and have seen all the more recent Star Trek movies. I like Matrix, X-Men, Star Wars, Star Trek, etc., so if you haven't seen these and like those kinds of films, I highly recommend it. Plus, the price was unbeatable.
B00CATSONE|1.0|this book was poorly written, title is misleading and thus a waste of time. its a self help book and was not advertised as such. do not read id u think its non-fiction
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Reinforced my psychology training with the latest printed material.  I loved it.  It was a keeper and in my collection.

B00555X8OA|5.0|Trained me to get speed when I needed to and to calm down when there was nothing I could do about it.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|this series is truly gripping tv.  the characters are well written and well acted and the leads are perfect foils for each other.  i'm loving it.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Prepared me for 2009 and I predicted the crash before it happened and almost gave away stock picks that you should invest in.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I love this book! perfect illustrations, easy to follow through and the products outcome are 100% awesome!<br />the delivbery was very fast
B001FA0W5W|5.0|It made me understand that there is causation and an underlying order to chaos.  On and on and on and.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not impossible. Easy to get caught up in winning. Great way to spend some free time. I would recommend.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I really liked the way this story was written. Sort of matter of fact - not an overuse of adjectives. The story is interesting and it reads as if it were non fiction.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I am new to automatic and mechanical wind wristwatches, so, after purchasing a rather expensive battery operated quartz movement over a year before this Seiko the battery went dead and that was a huge disappointment for me. The battery operated quarts movement  watch that I owned was supposed to have a 5 year life but died much sooner. I took the watch to a jeweler to have the battery replaced and the cost for the replacement battery was through the roof. Not only was it expensive to have the battery replaced but the Jeweler ruined the water resistance 'integrity' of the watch by smashing the o-ring that seals the back of my watch. Well, it didn't take long for my battery operated watch to become totally destroyed by water intrusion. Almost immediately after my battery watch failed that's when I decided that I was no longer going to buy 'ANYMORE' battery operated wristwatches so, the search began for a new mechanical or automatic watch. It took a long while, I was shopping almost everyday for over a month but most of the wristwatches were overly expensive and had features I wasn't really excited about. After about 2 months of shopping I accidentally stumbled upon these Seiko's. I sure am glad I waited and found them. I AM VERY PLEASED!<br /><br />When I received my new Seiko automatic wristwatch I could see right of way it was no piece of junk. It was heavy and felt good in my hands. The dial was easy to read even without my eyeglasses. I am a 54 year old man with extremely poor vision so I need high contrast to see the time and daily calendar. Although some reviewers may have complained it's smaller then what they had expected, I think it's a very appropriate size for both males and females. Perhaps for some people and I guess depending on your taste in fashion and social statement perhaps it may be to small for some men. I am a 6 foot man at 260 pounds and I think it's a perfect size and I am very picky. Just so everyone knows, most of the watches I currently own are the Invicta Russian Divers and they're huge timepieces, I really love those large watches however, this smaller Seiko watch was refreshing. What I mean by refreshing: I am always worried about ruining my other expensive watches, I don't wear them everyday but this Seiko is a watch I can wear everyday and not worry about banging it around since they are cheap enough to actually purchase several others.<br /><br />These Seiko's are perfect for everyday wear. I usually only wear my Invicta's when I go to dinner or some other social gathering but these Seiko's are actually very pretty and masculine enough to go out for dinner or other social occasions. Really, it's not that small and it's also not an ugly watch. This Seiko wristwatch probably won't get noticed as much as perhaps another more expensive wristwatch but if you take it off and show it to someone I know they are going to like it. I think what matters most to myself is knowing that I have a brand new 'name brand' Seiko quality wristwatch and never have to worry about a battery ever again or accidentally breaking it. I'm usually pretty careful so I am not really worried about breaking it although, this Seiko feels really tough so I think it can take a good beating.<br /><br />Let me tell you what I like about my new Seiko wristwatch. First, It keeps perfect time. After just a few days it's still accurate...I like the size of this watch, large watches get bumped a quite a bit however this watch has a lower profile so it's not likely to easily bump into things as you perform your daily chores... I like the stem at the 4 O'clock position because it makes it much easier to adjust without having to remove the watch from my arm...The brushed steel finish is absolutely beautiful... The crystal is flat making the watch face easy to read at any angle... I truly like the high contrast of the hands against the dial... The calendar is very large and very easy to see with ample contrast even without my eyeglasses... Pulling the stem out one click sets the calendar without stopping the watch, turn the stem clockwise for the day and counter clockwise for the date... I like that the watch movement does not stop operating when the stem is pulled all the way out to adjust the time, you can however stop the watch from ticking if you put some slight counterclockwise pressure on the stem, this allows for more accurate time setting. A little more counterclockwise pressure also makes the watch run backwards for even more accurate time setting... I happen to like the watch band and buckle, too...  What I really like are the luminescent hands and markers. I noticed just this morning after 5 hours of compete darkness the hands and markers were still view-able although, the luminescence wasn't overly bright but there was just enough to see the time in complete darkness... I like that the watch is not overly complicated with sub-dials. Everything I need to know about the time and date is supplied with this Seiko... I like that it's water resistant... Finally, I really like that's it's a Seiko but more importantly it's the perfect wristwatch with all the perfect features for the perfect price... This watch has all the features I was looking for in a in a new watch... I have to say, \\"I am so very happy with this new watch so I just purchased two more in different colors, the tan and the blue. Soon I will buy a green and another black.<br /><br />I think you'll truly enjoy this Seiko wristwatch! I am not disappointed whatsoever so, I highly recommend the purchase of this watch. For this kind of money, it's absolutely PERFECT!<br /><br />Thank you for reading :)<br /><br />.ling the stem out one click sets the calendar without stopping the watch, turn the stem clockwise for the day and counter clockwise for the date...

B003BW0CB6|4.0|Very well written, exciting from beginning to end.<br />I enjoyed reading . I want to buy more of his novels
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I had this on my Amazon \\"wish list\\" for a while based on all the good reviews.  I am so glad I borrowed it from the library instead.  Nice enough book, easy read, but the characters were not developed enough and the ending was rather a let down.  I am not sure exactly what I was expecting, but this did not live up to the hype.  This book has a good premise, but I still felt is was lacking.  Worth reading, but not buying.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|I love how they matched up with the originals. It flowed beautifully! I would definitely watch it again! Great plot!
1781162646|5.0|I was a Stephen King fan years ago but stopped reading his work when aliens starting becoming a common theme.  This book was the old style thriller.  Even my husband, who is more of a magazine than book reader, enjoyed Joyland.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is pretty good. The more you play the harder it gets. The only issue is it puts a drain on your smart phone or kindle.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game has had its up and downs but all the glitches seem to be 97% fixed!. Favorite Hinton game by far
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|This movie was very well acted. One of the best fight pictures we have seen in years. Would recommend it.
B00640UICA|3.0|I couldn't find a help section to help me figure things out when I got stuck. Othr than that, it was okay.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Just &#34;No&#34;t a good movie.<br />Really strange story line and did not make any sense and  very hard to follow.
B004RCUJ9E|2.0|I had too much difficulty manuevering the shark around the screen to eat the fish. Help info is not very helpful.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Thought provoking... intense film.  I would recommend  it to my friends.  There are some good twists thrown in it for kicks.
B00DU16OJM|5.0|Another Guy Clark great.  Yes, Clark is old and his voice sounds that way.  However, his songs have always supported his voice.  It's not like he's loverboy trying to hold on to some 80s hit.  No, Guy Clark's age fits each song perfectly and sounds like, well, the old man in Desperados Waiting for a Train.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|The Christmas Carol is one of my favorite Christmas stories. I love this novel and I am glad I have my very own copy on my Kindle so I can read it whenever I feel like it. Thanks Amazon for having it a such an unbeatable great price. I highly recommend this book.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time.  Love Cheney's style.  Look forward to more from her.  Highly recommend this one.
B000002KFJ|5.0|This is an awesome album, glad I found it on cd. Had it on cassette and it wore out from playing it so much!
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|Movie is about how the wizard of Oz came to be, the history of the wicked witch(es) and Glinda.  Gives some depth to the original movie The Wizard of Oz.  Well made movie, must have!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very cute little app don't like that everything costs so much when you're just starting out and have so little money. But overall cute game.
0545586178|5.0|I could not stop reading this.  I finished the book in 2 days.Had to keep reading to see what happened next.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Reza Aslan demonstrates an excellent understanding of the time and context of the life of Jesus of Nazarath. As a life-long Christian I found nothing in his book that was incorrect. I found much that elaborated on the life of persons living in that era. Bravo, Reza Aslan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome thinking game<br />Loved playing n trying to figure it all out can't wait for not to play more levels. Have fun
B004ADH1RI|2.0|While trying to watch this movie I experienced difficulty in loading. sometimes when I tried to pause the player, it ended up fast forwarding the movie and started there.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This was a very enlightening book.  I have since stopped taking wheat products for about a month now.  Since then I have lost about 5 pounds and a rash I had for 50 some years has disappeared.  It is hard to stop eating wheat products but the book explains why you have a hard time quitting but it is worth the small discomfort.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book fitfully concluded the saga with a bittersweet ending. My Spider Senses were already tingling at a most likely ending. Some bombs, both literal and metaphorical were tossed in.<br />I could sense that Katniss was moving from being Captain Ahab to realizing that one tyrant was being replaced with another. It needed a court scene with Katniss making a Cicero like oration and winning her point to be more satisfying.<br />Catching Fire had a more effort to result feel to it.<br />Over all I think our heroine thought too much. Over thinking leads to incorrect conclusions. Believe me, I know!
0062014536|3.0|I wanted to like this book so much. After the cliffhanger we were left with in the second book, the third book was just aching to be read right away.<br /><br />Lena proclaimed her love to Julian and finds out that Alex is still alive all at the same time. Now she is a bit torn between them, though this book barely focuses on the love relationship and only really has a couple dramatic scenes of issues because of it. I enjoyed learning more about Hana's life in this book. However, I am left with loads of questions that won't be answered. We are left with a cliffhanger again in a way but with absolutely no mention of any book to come out after this, though it is truly possible to go on! I felt like the book was forced to a climax and had no ending at all. Sure the little end phrases were pretty and all, but the whole thing just bugged me.<br /><br />I am glad I could read about Alex's time for a 27 paged short story about him after the book finished, but that only leads up to his time before seeing Lena when they realized both of them were still alive.<br /><br />I also have a hard time reading a lot of the profanities throughout this. This is a young adult book, but many teens read it, and yes, I get that many teenagers use such language, but a lot of it took away from the enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />It wasn't a bad book, and I enjoyed the story, I was just left completely unsatisfied and felt like it was a bit boring, even if it did only take me a few days to read it (I read a lot of books in general though).<br /><br />I truly hope that others like this book more than I did.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm a big fan Stephen King fan.  Loved the Dark Tower Series, but the latter episodes faded a bit. Under the Dome was excellent, but I think this was a better book overall. I definitely couldn't put it down once I started.
B0053O89K6|5.0|Great ending for a great show... Emotional, thought provoking.  The friendship between House and Wilson is a study for the ages. This season is as culturally significant as great works like Star Wars!<br />A must own for any fan of great TV dramas!!
B005P1TH2G|5.0|If you have ever coiled wire by hand you know it can take hours to do large projects.  This really does do it much faster & once you learn to use it and find your rhythm it also coils much more symmetrically than by hand.<br /><br />There are a couple different Coiling Gizmo products by Beadalon but this is the better version and the stabilizing bar is much larger.  The other version is much smaller & does not offer as many size variations. I purchased the smaller one first then found this one on Amazon for about the same price I paid for the smaller version.<br /><br />As with any new gadget there is a bit of a learning curve but there are some great videos on YouTube to help you out.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Lessons of life in this gem of a read. It will change how you look at facts and weigh intuition to make decisions!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Wow. Well, where to start is a little difficult. I guess, What at twist, is a good place. This post apocolyptical rendition is one of the few better ones I have seen. I guess because I can relate to the dangers of being a technician out in the field. But, I guess that's getting too deep into it. But we really loved it. Just wished it lasted a little longer and maybe hinting of a sequel or something. My mind was eager for more. I would recommend this to all. Especially the sci-fi techies everywhere.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This was a great movie. I remember watching Star Trek when I was a kid with my Dad. Would love to see this come out as a series or even a mini-series. Keep them coming. Great acting and action all around....love it!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very good! Well articulated, and all the Actors and Actresses are to be commended in delivering a very fine performance on Downton Abby.
1781162646|5.0|It's Stephen King weaving a scary yet fun story about youth...Lost and found.  Would recommend to anyone who loves the Master of storytelling.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Great game. It moves fairly fast on the more difficult levels which is good to keep the pace up. I hate it when a game takes forever to analyze its next move.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|One of the best military stories of courage, compassion, and determination. Marcus had guardian angels protecting him via the prayer warriors back home in USA.<br /><br />Highly recommend American Sniper - Chris Kyle.
0307949486|2.0|It is quite hard to understand the huge popularity of this book.I started it with great anticipation as I enjoy the thriller genre,The plot was slow to get going and one has to plod through the first 200 pages before it sparks into life and starts to grab the attention.<br />However,the characterisation is so poor-one has no real idea of what the characters are like,and thus cannot feel either much empathy or hostility to them.They are cardboard cut-outs,very much in the style of pantomime \\"goodies\\" or \\"baddies\\".<br />The prose style is leaden-in some foreign language books this can be the result of a poor translation (as one finds in some of the Wallender novels) but in this instance I believe it is just the style of the author.<br />Apart from the leaden prose style,there are areas where the author throws in extraneous material which the reader does not need to know.For instance,he devotes a long description to Sweden's care laws,which is deadly dull.He also constantly throws in immaterial information on the computers being used by the characters-this comes out as a paen of praise to Apple-I am an Apple fan myself,but became irritated by the constant references to powering up excellent Apple devices etc.In fact,the \\"goodies\\" in the book use Apple products and the \\"baddies\\" use PC's!<br />Inevitably the book ends with all the \\"goodies\\" coming out happily,with great jobs and a good sex life,and the baddies all end up dead or in gaol.Predictable and dull,perhaps like a Swedish winter.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Wow, what an album. This is a true rock blues treasure that is just fantastic. Stephen Stills sounds great and his guitar solos are mind blowing. This collaboration was simply genius. Take note, album needs to be listened to at a high volume setting. Rocking in the Free World and Word Game alone make this a must buy. As you can tell I love this album and just hope it isn't their last. Can't wait to see them in concert in September. I only wish there were more than 5 stars.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Unbelievable. He's been criticized lately. Too bad for the haters. It opens you up to question and examine your faith or lack thereof.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is one of the best games ever. Beautiful graphics, lovely music and challenging and unique puzzle solving challenges. What more could you ask for. This is the third quell game and they keep adding new challenges and features. Love it!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I knew nothing of the artist Rodriguez going into this movie which was probably a good thing as the movie takes you on a wild ride back in time.  The movie starts out slow but is a wonderful journey.  After watching the movie, I ordered the CD along with the two original CDs for sale which speaks volumes for the quality of the music produced by Rodriguez.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's a very fun game. But needs better updates for glitches in the system. It freezes up and product codes don't always work.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I knew nothing about the artist Rodriguez until I watch the &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; movie.  After I watched the movie, I bought this CD and &#34;Coming from Reality&#34;.  This first album is more raw but it is very good and interesting.  It is good to watch the movie to understand his background and better appreciate the messages in his songs.  &#34;Coming from Reality&#34; is more polished but it is hard to make a determination of which is better; each is different and good in it's own way.
B00DW3X07M|5.0|Very beautiful and enchanting music. Part medieval, Avante Garde, Fusion. Some of it reminds me of a Dragonslayer soundtrack. Virgil's drumming is impeccable. Highly recommended.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I knew nothing about the artist Rodriguez until I watch the &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; movie.  After I watched the movie, I bought this CD and the first album &#34;Cold Facts&#34;.  The first album is more raw but it is very good and interesting.  It is good to watch the movie to understand his background and better appreciate the messages in his songs.  &#34;Coming from Reality&#34; is more polished but it is hard to make a determination of which is better; each is different and good in it's own way.

B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Having seen the original judge dread with Sylvester Stallone I had to watch this film. Though I made it through most of the film it did not keep my attention and I ended up doing other things around the house while kind of watching it. It was entertaining but certainly not a very good movie. I give it three stars because I ended up watching the whole movie.
0545265355|4.0|My daughter is enjoying it very much. She has already finished the first book and looking forward to the second and third.
B00006JDVV|4.0|This is a great adventure movie in its own right, and should not be compared to a B Movie, even a good one.  It has a great cast, well acted and like all good fantasy films while the special effects are excellent they do not overwhelm the film.  I only wish the film was longer with more character development, and more tank vs dragon action.  The journey from the north of England to London seemed a little rushed which is a shame, a director's cut would be most welcome.  However, all things said this film is definitely worth a watch.

You can do all of the things you can with a real camera and more! And when you are finished it saves, but you can go back and step by step it shows you the changes you have made! This product is definitely on my list of best app ever! There's really nothing bad to say about it, it's absolutely amazing!

B000KWZ7VU|5.0|The Beethoven 32 are a cornerstone of the classical piano literature and offer an amazing range of emotional and intellectual challenges to the performer and listener alike. Maestro Barenboim has been performing these pieces since he was 17 and so has been digesting them for over 50 years. Accordingly he is able to approach each single note with comprehensive knowledge of them all and so it seems to me that there is not one nuance in any one movement of any one sonata that has not been thought out from the perspective of all 32 sonatas taken as a whole. This is why I think Maestro B's Beethoven is so great.<br /><br />These videos are a &#34;once in a lifetime&#34; opportunity to hear great music played by a great musician from the perspective of sitting on the bench beside him. The close ups of his hands and his very individualistic approach to the keyboard are priceless. The sound quality as well as the overall intimacy of the video is first rate. I have now listened/watched through the full 32 four times and will certainly do so many more times..
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have not enjoyed a crime mystery as much as William Landay's Defending Jacob in quite a long time. The development of the characters and story are well thought out. The writing here is engrossing and so realistic that I, who am a parent of a teenage boy, found myself relating to the frightening situation presented when Jacob is accused of murdering his classmate. I highly recommend this well written book.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott Jurek's story is both interesting and inspirational. You don't have to be a runner or a vegan to enjoy the book but, if you're not, you may be persuaded to try one or the other, or both.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This very well-written, page-turner is the story of Denny, an amateur-turned-pro race car driver, his marriage and then his wife's suffering and untimely brain-cancer death, his young daughter's experiences through all of this and the challenges his in-laws pose after their daughter dies. Sounds like a rather routine, run-of-the-mill soap opera eh? Wrong!!<br /><br />What makes The Art of Racing in the Rain so wonderful is that these happenings and more are told through the eyes of Enzo, a marvelous, all-knowing dog who paints marvelous word-pictures as only a gifted author (Garth Stein) can portray.<br /><br />From Wikipedia, &#34;The novel became a New York Times bestseller, remaining on the list for more than 156 weeks.&#34;  If you love animals as many of us do I urge you to read this superb story.

B00915G6MG|5.0|Another year...another superb season of NCIS!!  My husband & I just received our DVD today & couldn't stop watching at least the first disc.  We would have watched more until I realized it was after midnight!  We can't wait until tomorrow when we plan on watching at least one more disc.  We are now the proud owners of all 10 seasons.  The characters work so well together & the storylines are great.
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|Matt Damon takes on the big insurance company and stands up for the little guy. He plays a straight-laced newly licensed lawyer who is teamed up with Danny Devito and his own classic, slightly sleezy Devito style. Makes for an interesting match up.
B008YI91HS|5.0|It's still a ground breaking film.  I watched a new TV dino movie the other night and Jurassic Park FX, from 20 years ago, blew it away.  Jurassic park is a creative, enjoyable, and intelligent, and thought provoking.  Plus, my 8 year old daughter LOVES it!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Pretty good movie, Charlene Theron played a great part.  I like Kristen Stewart, she played a good snow white, movie was a little different than I thought it would be.
B008YI9CWW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  This pacing was uneven.  The trailer over the cliff was drawn out too long.  Jeff Goldblum is always fun to watch.  I enjoy the cadence of his words.  The little dino's attacking the mean guy was a little disturbing.  Looking forward to part 4.
0800132009|5.0|A drawback of the film (which some viewers protest) is that it distorts details of historical incidents in its failure to depict the depth of the atrocity-horrors that actual POWs experienced.  It also distorts facts about historical circumstances behind the story [which Hollywood movies often do].  For this reason, some former servicemen and POWs have taken offense and have given the movie a very low rating.  I think that the story which the movie and the actors do successfully tell is nevertheless excellent and quite worthwhile.<br /><br />The film is not meant to be chiefly a historical documentary but a fictional character study and societal commentary [about war and traditions of honor] set in the War-and-POW movie genre.<br /><br />When I first saw the story, I understood it as a story about the excellent accomplishments of Colonel Nicholson and his \\"army\\" of POWs.  I thought it was about their strength of character and obdurate wills bent upon excellence of accomplishment, despite being under extraordinary stress such as POWs typically undergo.<br /><br />Seeing the movie again recently, in 2013, I see that it's SO MUCH MORE than a typical POW/War movie!  In fact, I tend to think it is an anti-war movie at the same time that it is also appreciative of the heroic lives of some servicemen during wartime.  I base my new anti-war interpretation on the last spoken remark in the film.  This is by the Medic who, even though he isn't a leading figure in the story, has \\"the last word.\\"  It is just ONE word which is his take on the amazing tragedy that has just occurred.  (--And it's noteworthy that as the story draws to a climax, the Medic has taken a high and objective point of view above the bridge.)<br /><br />Themes interwoven in the story relate to living and dying with honor in the midst of great adversity; following war rules with absolute obedience (specifically in this case, the rules of the Geneva Convention which the Japanese General has no respect for); and having the \\"courage\\" to be obdurate and also self-sacrificing when one's principles are threatened to the point of torture and death.  (There is very little in the movie to indicate that any of these men act out of loyalty to God, but rather they act out of a typically British devotion to personal dignity, honor, and superiority of character at a high human level of traditional societal war values [specifically traditional British].)<br /><br />The American serviceman, who is selfishly self-interested, always willing to lie and compromise integrity and forego honorable actions, is played off against the high-minded, absolutely dutiful and responsible British Colonel who stands immovable and fearless in the face of persecution.  The Colonel is truly a Wonder and a Heroic figure, a very sympathetic character, but at the end of the movie, with the last flash-view of the Colonel's face (marvelous acting on the part of David Niven), one realizes that the Colonel has had a realization and there is the HINT of a different realization for the viewer also.  One wonders if his seamless devotion to duty and excellence has been actually a slavish form of inhuman madness!  Is he actually a \\"madman,\\" a military automaton?  And when the viewer thinks back over his demeanor during the story, especially the initial view of him as he marches into camp at the head of his body of soldiers, there is the memory of his being proudly mechanical, somewhat puppet-like.  Well, it's a thought to be weighed in the balance when the viewer meditates on Nicholson--and the other military leaders he or she has observed during the story.<br /><br />When General Saito begins to tell Colonel Nicholson about his personal history, in which his father has forced him away from a career in art and into a military life, the Colonel interrupts Saito, cuts him off without any fellow-human response or interest.  If the viewer recognizes that Saito has opened himself up personally and made himself vulnerable in this attempt to speak to Nicholson on an equal level, personally, more or less as a friend, it is painful to experience Nicholson's cold indifference to him--although, of course, Saito has demonstrated that he's capable of being a cruel and heartless man.  The vulnerable character of Saito who breaks down and cries--who must look forward to a ritual killing of himself if he meets with dishonor and failure as an officer under command--is interesting and touching.  [I think that Saito was one of the best actors, besides Niven.  There was a touching poignance  in the \\"hidden\\" character of the inwardly sensitive but outwardly cruel General Saito who had been forced into an unsuitable and yet highly-responsible military rulership by his father's probable regard for traditions relating to honorable professional choices within the Japanese culture.  So, it's interesting to note how General Saito is a foil and a counterpart--in the role of military leader--for the character of Colonel Nicholson, the very perfect embodiment of a great military man.<br /><br />Early in the story, when Saito and Nicholson clashed wills, I thought about the very difficult role of responsible military commanders in very difficult circumstances.  How horrid it would be for anyone to find oneself trapped in such a role with very important decisions to make, and yet to feel the task unwelcome and the decisions impossible.  Saito was unsuited to his task, was trying hard to enforce the power of his ruling position, and perhaps for that reason proved to be unwise and unequal to the situation.<br /><br />There are other subtleties which go into making this an intricate character study (involving man's inhumanity to man in wartime and the scores of senseless violent deaths resulting therefrom) as various individual men with certain individual personal traits undergo certain tests and responses under great duress.  It's a fine, excellently well-acted story, and it deserves to be considered the classicthat it is.<br /><br />The film has long, extended \\"trekking\\" sequences that are boring and seemingly serve little purpose.  I felt no compunctions about speeding these up during my VHS version of the movie in order to get past them.<br /><br />The quality of my VHS film was poor.  Blurry images throughout.  Better film quality much to be desired, but numerous reviewers complain about the poor quality of the newest blu-ray remakes too so there may not be much improvement to be had from investing in those.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I was always a big fan of Buck Owens and Don Rich, and when Merle Haggard was discovered in the early sixties. I was also a fan of his, and I loved the sound of his main lead guitar player &#34;Roy Nichols&#34; I was a fan of Vince Gill while he was a band member of &#34;Pure Prarie League&#34; I was really glad when Vince decided to make this tribute CD to Buck and Merle. I preordered it, and thought I would never get here, it finally did, and I was very pleased. I wish Vince would do a tribute now to Wynn Stewart.

B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Maggie Smith is only the cherry on the sundae. Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins (Upstairs Downstairs for one, Billy Connoly (Scottish comedian), Andrew Sacks (Faulty Towers) and a host of old stagers, musicians, singers Make this an affirmation of life well lived behind the footlights. While the credits were rolling, photo insets appeared of the unsung players with a photo of them in their best known rôle.I am not ashamed to admit that I wept manly tears at these people who had contributed so much to the entertainment world taking a last bow, as it were.<br />Dustin Hoffman was up to these Stars. He proved himself as a director.<br />My complaint: being of an age myself the Amazon rentals have no closed captions and even with two expensive hearing aids, the dialogue was frequently undecipherable. I must have lost many of the spoken nuances, but it was a great show nonetheless.

0486406482|4.0|In this timeless Jane Austen classic, Emma Woodhouse is young, rich, and beautiful.  She is happy and comfortable, without any complaint in the worry, doted on by everyone around her, especially her pleasant father.  A tragedy in the Woodhouse household is when someone departs -- first the eldest daughter Isabella and then the beloved governess -- but both Emma and her father are assured and comforted by the strongest belief that the two could never leave each other.<br /><br />The departure of her governess has vexed Emma though, and bored and feeling mischievous Emma decides to take on a new plaything -- a young impressionable Harriet Smith -- and play match-maker.  In the rustic bubble that is the lower British aristocracy, there is no crime, poverty, and disease, and everyone ends up marrying their rich, well-to-do, and articulate cousin or neighbor anyway.  Marriage then is a very low-stakes game, but because it is a game people -- especially Emma -- take it far too seriously, and seek to marry for the greatest advantage possible (marriage is for \\"security, stability, and improvement\\" in her words).  In her silly game-playing Emma mischievously plays with the feelings of all those around her, and in her silly mischief ends up marrying herself to the perfect man.<br /><br />I did not enjoy \\"Emma\\" as much as I thought I would.  Sometimes, the writing is beautiful and musical, as per Austen's intention.  But sometimes it can be clunky and overwrought as well.  The plot -- if what happens can be called a plot -- is low-stakes and meaningless, empty and silly gossip and chatter in people's parlour-rooms.  And insight into the priorities of high-born women intent on marriage -- especially the evasiveness and trickiness of their emotions -- is better handled by Iris Murdoch and Edith Wharton.<br /><br />What recommends the book -- and why it remains a timeless classic -- is that it is a perfect and timeless encapsulation of the priorities, engagements, and thinking ofwealthy women in any society and in any time -- the desire to maintain peace, grace, and the veneer of friendliness in their small society, while blocking out anything unpleasant or threatening to their small society.

B00D6QUMWG|5.0|When she begins this Verdi recital with Lady Macbeth's letter scene, Anna Netrebko (or her producer) had to be aware that she was putting herself directly against Maria Callas's first Verdi album, where the incomparable Callas stamped this music indelibly with her power, charisma, and dramatic intensity.  Throwing down the gauntlet runs the obvious risk of invidious comparison. But I must say that Netrebko triumphs. The dark coloration of her soprano, which began as a lyric voice, now carries real weight and passion. No one is a second Callas, but I haven't heard anything this good in a long time. It must also be admitted that for accurate intonation and evenness of tone from top to bottom, Netrebko outdoes Callas, who had acquired some vocal deficits by the time she made her Verdi album.<br /><br />Add to this much better recorded sound, and everything is set in place for a notable success. One hears a true Verdi dramatic soprano, capable of coloratura as well as power and thrilling intensity. For me, Netrebko's absence of Italianate style has been a problem, and even though her pronunciation doesn't sound like a native, it's as good as any rival on the scene (e.g., Maria Poplavskaya, Karita Mattila, Sondra Radvanovsky). She is developing Mattila's versatility, too, and the tone is similar, with a strong lower range and flashing top notes.<br /><br />With superb confidence Netrebko moves on to another great Callas aria, the Sleepwalking Scene from Macbeth, done with tremendous personality and excellent vocal acting. Not just Callas but Scotto and Tebaldi evoked more tenderness and poignancy in their singing, but once you're comparing Netrebko with such great artists, she has already won the day. Since I admire Noseda's conducting, it's a bit disappointing that he doesn't dig in more - the Macbeth arias seem to skate by a little.<br /><br />In her selection of five heroines, Netrebko has chosen two rarities, Joan of Arc and Elena from I vespri siciliana.  Of the other heroines, Leonora from Il trovatore is represented by several arias, Elisabetta from Don Carlos by only one, the stupendous 'Tu che le vanita,\\" which Callas also made her own. It requires the ability to sustain the character while singing at the upper and lower extremes of a soprano's range. Up to now, I've admired how well anja Harteros encompasses it, but Netrebko is stunningly even throughout, a display of vocalism that really does remind one of the Golden Age. I never suspected that she would develop into such all-around excellence, but I'm thrilled that she has. Every opera lover will be deeply grateful.<br /><br />Verdi:<br /><br />Nel d&igrave; della vittoria ... Ambizioso spirto ... Vieni t'affretta! ...

Yes, I will finish it but need time to reconsider my perspective.

B00DP3IESY|3.0|&#34;Oblivion&#34; was worth a one time viewing but I am not likely to watch it again.  The special effects are good and add a modicum of entertainment value.  CONS:  The plot is convoluted and the basic concept is unrealistic and not particularly well conceived - even for science fiction.  The construction of the characters does not really permit me to &#34;connect&#34; or empathize with them.  I felt this way right after watching this movie.  Two weeks later, this is not a memorable movie for me in any sense.  Rent it to watch - not worth buying the DVD.

0316066524|4.0|This is a fascinating, mind-bending read, something of a modern-day meld of Moby Dick and Ulyssess. And yes, i mean that in a positive way, those are among my favorite books. Like both those books, it's long, dense, and there are parts that bore, parts that challenge & puzzle, and parts that sing. Like Moby Dick, there are LOTS of footnotes, and some are among the best parts of the book.<br /><br />You will have to get beyond the 1990s vision of what today would be like; it somehow manages to be both less technologically advanced and more---but the corporate sponsorship part is perfect.And you will learn more about tennis than you ever possibly wanted to know.<br /><br />But, do yourself a favor and don't buy the paper version. The ebook version is soooo much more portable and it's so much easier to click through to the endnotes & back again instead of fumbling with pages and losing your place.

B00C391Y3I|3.0|Good editing does not draw attention to itself, which unfortunately is not the case here. A whopping 77 camera edits during the Victim of Changes guitar solo alone.  This Editor should never work again.<br /><br />Also, what's with Halford hunched over and staring at the floor while he is singing...is he arthritic? Check out the 1983 US Festival video (also on youtube) for the real Halford I remember seeing. Yeah, I know he's 60 but that is no excuse for ignoring the audience. Overall, great set-list, stage show, and music but I can't recommend this in its current form.<br /><br />Please re-release for those with a normal attention span.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|From the outset of this film, I was captivated by the young lady's journey through lavish stage sets and fantastic landscapes as she followed 'the aerialist' as he vanished into a strange and mystical world. This production incorporated some of the finest performances I have ever seen by Cirque du Soleil performers, including some amazing sets and extravagant costumes. Every Cirque du Soleil show that I have seen has been greatly enhanced by the accompanying music and this one is no exception, which is especially impressive when listened to through a good Dolby Digital sound system. Highly recommended.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|If you know Bruce Willis, you know this movie. Typical action thriller. Not ready for the Oscars, but it is fine for its genre.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Those is challenging  and fun!  And who doesn't love a minion or two.<br />Very similar to temple run if you like that you'll love this.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This is outrageous.  See the title?  That's the language I get.  Found a place called just answer, they charge $30..<br />Forget about both of them.  I'll just ask my husband if I have any questions for Google.  He knows everything, anyway.
B005PK57IK|4.0|I truly enjoy this type of entertainment ~ even if it is a soappy! Sometimes I watched the episodes all day!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Intense from the beginning to the end.  The story moves from one episode to the next. can not wait for season 4
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters in the show seem to reflect the social mres of the time. I especially like the dowinger countess.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I'm not really a big Tom Cruise fan, but this movie was very watchable. Good action, although a little slow to develop. Worth a look!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Moving, suspenseful,good character development, entertaining read. Different generations approach to an age old problem.<br />Good, relaxing vacation story with an Australian twist.
B0058VW36U|3.0|First off, The game is fine. It's challenging and enjoyable at the same time and I would recommend it. However, I am sick of seeing ad after ad while paying it, It's very annoying. I wish they had a paid version of this app where I could pay a dollar or 2 and not have to deal with the ads. It's really brings down the game in my opinion.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|This notepad is not user friendly. It is difficult to enter data and not easy to edit. Will no use very much.

B006O5YHUY|5.0|This is by far one of the best (if not the very best) MMA movie I have ever seen!  The acting was impeccable and the story line couldn't have been better. It's also not filled with all of the hollywood junk that most movies have. Highly recommended!!!
B00846WWVM|3.0|Solid looking graphics and certainly interesting but that's about it. Controls are not as good as they could have been and can lead to frustration at times. It's also surprisingly difficult early on, I have no idea why, and it's a big flaw of the game in my opinion. I think once they toned down the difficulty and tweaked with the controls a bit then they'd have a much more playable game.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|slow moving; slow character development,  not action-packed.  Difficult to understand where the novel was going.  But glad I read it.
B000FCK65W|5.0|If you've ever wondered what it was like to come of age during the early 1900's than this book is for you.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable book that is more like a diary than a novel.  The characters live and breathe outside the pages, and I quickly fell in love with them as though they were my own family members.  --Indeed, I felt as though I might be reading about my own Grandmother, and what life was like for her.  This book reminded me a bit of \\"A Christmas Story,\\" as it is told through the eyes of a child, and is but a slice of her family's every-day life, and their struggles as part of the working class poor.<br /><br />Sometimes we look back at our own childhood's with nostalgia, and long for those \\"carefree\\" days of youth-- but truth be told, they weren't all that care-free.  We forget the drama of the school yard, the minefields we negotiate in our neighborhoods and our yearnings to carve out our own niche, and understand the workings of the world as it relates to us.<br /><br />The title, beautifully and poignantly metaphoric, whose message is one of hope.  A tree does indeed survive, and even thrive surrounded by concrete and the ever present threat of it's roots being suffocated.  I am so happy that this book was recommended to me, you will not be disappointed with this gem.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoy except when it shuts down and I have to remove and reinstall. I use on my Kindle Fire so have no idea how it would work on phone.
B009AY04A8|4.0|too much dialogue but great graphics.  some sections were really difficult but very addicting.  Without dialogue though, the is no story.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|FUN GAME<br />. This would be a great game for kids of all ages! I would play this game while waiting for doctors; flights; or just out of boredom.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|A puzzling solving sort of game where you have to get all the goo sucked through the pipe. It's a bit complicated and frustratingly difficult at times, Even when you are early on into the game, and it really brings it down overall. I think if it were easier then it'd be at least more playable.<br /><br />Overall, It's a solid game ruined by the high difficulty.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I like this game so far except the penalty for extra tapping. I  shake sometimes, can't help it. I like the story line also. However I did not care for hunting objects in the dark. I think this game is priced too high for what you get.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love  this game so much ice age is th  best movie ever but that's my option. It's so cool how they took the movie and replace it as a video game for kids and adults also. For this game I could rate it five stars
B0091REZMW|5.0|Not too bad. its fun when you are bored. You can run out of energy really fast. I like the game.
B00005JN0T|5.0|This is a great movie! There are many twists and turns and lots of action. If you like sci-fi, you won't be disappointed!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game really gets the old grey matter working.Thankfully there are hints<br /> for when the old grey matter gives up
B000MD9UJC|4.0|I always liked the Mini-Maglites, but did not like replacing the batteries so often.  This is a great conversion.<br /><br />It was a bit tricky getting the pins to insert completely into the sockets without bending, but once installed it works very well.<br /><br />The focus is not as tight as with the halogen bulb, but the light seems much brighter.<br /><br />Finally the switch is required because the LED can't be disconnected from the battery by turning the housing. The switch seems a little flimsy, so we'll see how well it holds up over time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the free daily games. Especially love that you can see all four cards when your playing. Nice to be able to play daily with free bingo chips
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome app could use some more updates<br />you should get this app if u cant play the pc or xbox
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Really enjoyed this futeristic tale of a post acopotlitic earth. Morgan Freeman plays the commander of the Scav's who are battling for the earth with a race of aliens. Tom Cruise plays a 'drone repairman' plagued with reoccuring dreams of a 'past life'. Well done with good special effects
B003UBTX72|5.0|Great read. Gave me valuable info on guitar tunings, so that i wrote a song using one. A loveable guy for sure. Rock on Keef.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This game makes you think and strategize. There is a flaw however, the pop up ads jar the game while you're playing throwing you off. If the small flaw is fixed it will be more fun to play and you can't beat the price.

B000SEI230|5.0|This has been my favorite book for the longest time. It's romantic, touching, and realistic. Sparks gets me every time.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My kids (ages 3 and 7) and I love The Gruffalo book.  I am always skeptical that a movie will not be as good as the book.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The movie was well done - graphics, characters, etc.  I don't feel any of the book was compromised.  Very pleased.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This is a movie you need devote an evening to as it is on the longish side, every time that you think you have the plot figured out (and there are multiple story lines running at the same time) it will take a twist into a different direction.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Good holiday page turner.. An enjoyable journey through some twists and turns. Lee keeps the action turning over at a good pace.
B004LROMSO|5.0|So, you've watched The Game of Thrones, The Borgias, and Spartacus and now it is time to watch something else.  Another fantasy?  Or Mad Men, the winding down Sopranos, The Big C or a comedy, perhaps.  And besides, you know all about the legend of King Arthur, you've seen the movies Camelot and Excalibur, right?  Well, wrong.<br /><br />  Just because something is named Camelot doesn't mean you've seen it before.  The British say, \\"You can do anything you want with King Arthur, as long as you never make him the villain.\\"  And this series decided to remake King Arthur in a way you hadn't thought of before.  Well, partly, but coming from a completely different direction.<br /><br />  First, Arthur is not blindingly cute nor is he devastatingly handsome.  This Arthur is a pleasant-looking young blonde man who has to make himself stand out and be looked up to for his courage and thinking.  Guinevere is a simple, beautiful young lass who is marrying another man and Morgan is the unloved older sister who has gotten everything wrong in her mind and turned to magic to right the misunderstood wrongs.  All of these people and the rest of the cast flit through your imagination as you watch them on the screen.  You are even surprised to find that Camelot, itself, is an old ruin of a Roman castle with part of the roof missing and overgrown with vines.  Poor Arthur really has to start from scratch!<br /><br />  The writers decided not to choose between the sword-in-the-stone and the-lady-of-the-lake.  They managed to write a very interesting take on both!  No real sorcery involved in either.  But Arthur is lead to believe there is and what we believe is what makes us what we are.<br /><br />  The scenery is gorgeous, the CGI is not overly used and the actors are wonderful.  You are easily drawn into this story and want to know more.  Plus it has the sexiness of The Games of Thrones, to appeal to the adult audience, not for children.  In the first season, like GoT, there is not yet a full scale battle scene, but very clever skirmishes.  The way Arthur handles an entire group of foe on his own will delight you.  You will say, \\"Yes.  Arthur does deserve to be king!\\"<br /><br />  Ah, you think, where is Merlin?  Yes.  Well.  There is the rub.  You can take a great actor, like Joseph Fiennes, and if he is given a bad script, he caun't save the character.  Or maybe, Fiennes was totally miscast.  As an Arthurian fan, and you most like are or you wouldn't be checking this show out, you know that Merlin does not necessarily mean pointed hat, long white beard and flowing gown with stars and moons.  But he should do something besides feel sorry for himself while gloating as well.  He might as well have been wearing a hair shirt and walked around flogging himself.  There is a way to present inner turmoil mixed with duty that is not depressing.  In no way can we feel sorry for this Merlin.<br /><br />  So, why did this well-written, beautifully filmed (in Ireland), wonderfully acted programme not get a second season?  Well, I believe that mainly you can find the answer in the first paragraph.  On the other hand, it could have been Merlin.  However, as far as the series goes, you will really enjoy it and, since you already know the story, the ending will satisfy you, if not leaving you feeling a bit sorry not to find out poor Arthur and Guinevere's reactions when they find out the truth about Morgan!  But if you are captivated by the Arthurian legend anyway, you can most likely go to another website and read lots of fanfic carrying on the story in varying degrees...or, hey, write your own!

0671042858|5.0|I've said before that if this book hadn't been written by Stephen King it would probably be taught as a good coming of age novel.  I loved the story as it combines several of my nightmare scenarios (getting lost in the woods, evil things stalking me when I'm lost in the woods, and the woods).  I found the premise to be compelling and oddly believable.  And I loved the role that Tom Gordon, and listening to the ball games, played in the story.  I loaned my copy of this book to someone and I think I'm going to have to buy it for my kindle because I love it that much and I want to read it again.  This will be at least the third time.<br /><br />This is not just my favorite King book, it is one of my favorite books, period.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey guys was just wondering if you could add flint and steel to creative mode btw love the game my user is wafflz117 thx
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's a good game to spend a few minutes here and there playing.  Good action and fast paced.  Haven't made it far enough yet to see if upgrades get impossibly expensive through playing alone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not into reality (fake) TV at all and did not like zombies. Until, I watched this and it reminded me about 'The Night of the Living Dead' movie. Used to go to the midnight showings in the early 80s and loved it then and this brought back good memories. Excellent plot for the series.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|I found the Adjustment Bureau to be very entertaining, and with a couple of subtle messages.  Not one of the standard formula movies, although the plot has been done before, often.  Thought provoking and with some cute jokes and plot subthemes.  My wife thought it was a bit slow at the start but then warmed up to it.<br /><br />No sex, no violence, and every other wasn't offensive.  Of course any movie with these qualities is bound to be a financial flop, but it's not due to the lack of a fun plot, nicely executed by a very capable cast and director.<br /><br />Well worth the cost of a rental.  I give it four dollar signs out of 5 for it's value.
B000VT6FAO|5.0|Five words: Dave Gahan from Depeche Mode. Enough said. You like the band, you'll like the man solo. Great CD!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This review is also available at: The Not-So-Literary Heiresses ([...]<br /><br />This book was a total mind-f*ck. It seriously made me happy to be single. This is what you should read when you want to get over a break-up. Seriously. It's also one of the best psychological thrillers I've read in a very, very long time.<br /><br />It's really hard to review this because I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I will try to be very vague. A seemingly happy couple. The wife goes missing under dubious circumstances and the husband becomes the prime suspect for her suspected murder. Did he or didn't he? The first half of the book is pretty much you unearthing the mystery of what happened to Amy and if Nick really did kill her, because it certainly seem that he did something. Then, all of a sudden, boom! You are slammed with a revelation so unexpected that will totally shatter all your initial thoughts about the book's storyline and its characters.<br /><br />And that is why I loved this book so much. Because the author has managed to trick me into believing that the plot is going a certain way. That the initial mystery is the center of the whole story. I felt duped and manipulated and I couldn't believe that I was that gullible... but then again this is how 80% of the characters in this book felt. My one comment is that the ending felt a bit anti-climactic... but I'm still giving it 5 Stars because it seriously did a number on me. I was thinking about this book days after reading it.<br /><br />If you want a roller coaster ride of manipulation, deceit, and deliciously twisted characters, then you should definitely read this one. I highly recommend it.

B0027MJU00|4.0|This review is also available at: The Not-So-Literary Heiresses ([...]<br /><br />3.5 Stars<br /><br />I don't know why I picked this book first and not the more popular Gone Girl. I think because I have this certain interest in True Crime and the blurb is kind of reminiscent of that. This may be my least favorite book between the three but it still served as my first taste of Gillian Flynn's emotionally broken characters.<br /><br />Libby never really grew out of being a victim. Her whole life she relied on the trust fund she received from her supporters as the soul survivor of a ritualistic massacre. Emotionally stunted and a kleptomaniac, her physical flaws are nothing compared to her mental and emotional state. It took me awhile to empathize with Libby because even though she was a victim, the grown woman I got to know was selfish and opportunistic. But then I thought, what can you expect? She grew up with the knowledge that her brother brutally killed her whole family and she's the main reason that he's in prison for life. If that doesn't screw you up then I don't know what will.<br /><br />\\"There are few phrases that annoy me more than I won't bite. The only line that pisses me off faster is when some drunk, ham-faced dude in a bar sees me trying to get past him and barks: Smile, it can't be that bad! Yeah, actually, it can, jackwad.\\"<br /><br />The story intercuts between the past and present, with POVs of three main characters which include Libby (in the present), Ben (in the past), and their mother (in the past). Reading the past for me was the most difficult because I knew what was to come and it's really hard to wrap your mind around the fact that this family, these little girls, will soon be brutally murdered.<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot's twist and turns and the storyline was so complex that it had me guessing until the end. I admit sometimes it felt that there were too many things going on with the mystery, and because of that there were times that it was too confusing to follow. But then I realize that that's the book's main point: that nothing is what it seems, even the most cut and dried of explanations can cover up a more complex truth.t was too confusing to follow.

1451695195|2.0|If you like after-death books, I recommend instead, Doctor Maurice S. Rawling's account to be most credible and complete, (as Dr. Rawlings was an emergency doctor witnessing the patient, as well as interviewing them, instead of just the patient's point of view.)  Plus Dr. Rawlings explained why lots of folks \\"forget\\" some of the experience later on. (Especially the negative experiences) I also read later about some contradictions regarding Dr. Alexander's account. Perhaps that's why I felt an uneasiness inside my gut while reading it. Sorry to all the fans...just my humble opinion.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|This is a fun game to play. I do wish the fish were worth more points. I like the fact that the game gets more challenging the farther you go.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It is so much fun and also challenging. I really like that you don't have to sign up through face book like so many other games. I would encourage everyone to get this game.
B0050UEVNM|5.0|Generally when you put a group of big name stars together in a movie, it usually does not do well (remember Valentine's Day). But they got it right this time. This movie grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go. You are drawn into each character's life and waiting to see what happens next until you get to the end and you finally see how the stories connect. Its a very funny, sad and touching journey into family and relationships. If you like a good comedy/romance/drama, watch this movie.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We missed watching it on TV<br />After hearing so much about it from others,<br />we decided to buy it and see for ourselves.<br />It was like a good book you can't put down.<br />We had a weekend marathon and can't wait<br />for the next season.

B0083EY9EI|5.0|At a time when there are so many female pop artists that all sound the same, Emeli Sande is a breath of fresh air.

B003U6BE8I|5.0|This movie is so great that I have no words to express it. Action was at the right level and timing was right. Yes it's different from the book but it had the same concept.  I'm eagarly waiting for the wholes series
B0010SKUYM|4.0|After reading some of the very negative reviews about this, I was hesitant to start it (I checked it out from my library). But, running out of new fantasy books to read, I decided to delve in anyways...and really, it's not as bad as some have said. The beginning meandered...a lot. I would say the first 20% or so I just kept thinking \\"what exactly is the POINT of this???\\" but once Chronicler was introduced and Kvothe's story got going, I couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed the backstory. The \\"present day\\" parts...not so much. I am waiting on the second book to be available at my library, so maybe the parts with the scrael will make more sense, but as far as this book goes, I don't feel it added much.<br /><br />The pacing was good for the most part. Again, after the first little bit of the book, it really got much better and didn't meander as much. The story itself is interesting. I'm still a little confused about the whole sympathy system and naming, etc., but I was also confused for a bit by the allomancy in \\"Mistborn\\" but came to love it (and the entire trilogy - it's amazing). I'm hoping the same will happen here.<br /><br />The characters were ok. I don't feel a connection to Kvothe yet and he seems a little too good to be true, but he is interesting for sure. I think most everyone can identify with wanting to be the kid prodigy, good at everything but still having a flaw or two, having adventures left and right without meaning to. I know I keep drawing similarities to Mistborn, but he reminds me of Vin, which is a good thing. The supporting characters are ho hum in my opinion, there has not been a lot of depth to them with the exception of Denna, and I still don't REALLY know the first thing about her. Hoping for some answers in book two.<br /><br />In conclusion, I will definitely be reading book two whenever it becomes available but this was definitely not my favorite first book in a series. However, it is NOT as bad as some of the reviewers have stated. Worth a chance at least.

The watch lost about 2 hours per day.<br />Amazon's return policy and procedure are top notch and easy to use. After describing the problems they gave me a prepaid UPS  label to print, and that was it.<br />I have reordered the watch and will modify this review when it arrives.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Another awesome read!  I am going to read it again just to make sure I absorbed it all.  Before ordering book 4 and season 3 DVD.
B00C6MYITO|3.0|Ever read a book when you were a kid and wondered what had happened to the character? That's why I bought this through kindle. Its a little cheesy but a nice happy read and ends the story of Pollyanna very tidily.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is still a great movie even tough it's old. One of the most innovative SciFi stories coupled with great execution. Superb combination.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved this show - can't wait for new season to begin!  I knew that was going to happen...so sorry it did.  Cliff hanger!
B00594XOZU|4.0|on my kindle fire it still texts other people on iphone i love this  app<br />on my kindle i can not change the color of my text bubble on iphones you can do that
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!!! On survival I killed 456 Zombies, 386 Creepers, 489 Spiders. Plus I have a diamond sword, a lot of iron pic axes, iron helmet iron chest plate, iron pants, diamond shoes.
B00821OX98|5.0|awesome love it drama action suspense great to fallow just in case a alien invasion knowing what could happen make you prepare
1609611543|5.0|Now goin on 1 Year exactly to the month--next month, Ive been gluten free wheatfree and feelin fine. Consciousness. Awareness. Education. Life...that is what this book means to me.
1401907725|5.0|I am so not into the negative. These are true angle cards, positive and uplifting! Thank You Doreen, Blessings & Aloha
B000FCK65W|5.0|This is a sad, moving story of another time - a true classic. I had always meant to read it and now with my new Kindle it was easy to do so.  The author so draws you into that life & time - it provided such insight to human nature.  I won't give a synopsis of the plot as I hate to ruin anyone's reading enjoyment.<br /><br />Just truly enjoyed it.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Make sure you have time to watch the entire film. It is a bit long, but nicely done. Worth a watch.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Enjoyed the book, very real life events and kept my interest throughout the entire book. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B003TJ4YUQ|4.0|This was supposed to be a DVD/CD set. Problem: only arrived with the DVD inside; no CD. Bummed out entirely.
B00CHILW64|5.0|One of the best \\"Based on a True Story\\" films I have ever seen.<br /><br />Naomi Watts(Maria) sold it, what a performance. She makes you feel her pain, she makes you believe her struggles and shows how strong the actual Maria must have been to overcome such obstacles. Unbelievable how good she is.<br /><br />Tom Holland(Lucas), what an actor. This was another amazing performance, so believable so strong. He quite possibly was my favorite actor in this movie. The emotion he brings out in you, the way he handled the role just made Naomi Watts better. He was a total selling point. Amazing.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor(Henry) is always good. He brings home another strong performance and shows his versatility. Very good.<br /><br />The two child actors, Samuel Joslin(Thomas) and Oaklee Pendergast(Simon) were so cute and played their parts well.<br /><br />This movie was so emotional. It is amazing to me how the human spirit and the will to survive, plus the strength of family are all brought to life in this amazing whole cast performance. The true family that this movie was based on is truly amazing as well. Inspirational. Still wiping away the tears. Rent it, buy it, watch it with family.
0761169253|3.0|Will know more after I have tried more suggestions from the book.  Has great possibilities.<br />Always a fun book to have on the shelf
B0082Z447U|5.0|This book was recommended by the author whose writing I admired.  She cited it as one that had inspired her.  I had never heard of Wilkie Collins before (I am ashamed to admit) not having read many Victorian novels.  However, it was also cited as the first mystery book (written in 1850) so I was intrigued.<br /><br />Found it to be very interesting, beautifully written and quite engaging!  Have gotten some of the other books he wrote (only the other top 3 of his career) and I am looking forward to reading those too.<br /><br />This one - if you don't mind a bit of old fashion style of writing - is worth the time.  I got great enjoyment out of it - and in certain exciting parts became so upset / agitated I had to put the book down for a bit.  I was quite drawn into the characters and what was happening to them....
B000YHG72E|5.0|We laugh every time we see this. Will Ferrell does a wonderful job portraying a child like elf, and the other characters in the movie are great too. Highly recommend this- it's so silly!
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I bought this book simply because I was curious about Portia de Rossi's case in regards to eating disorder. After I began reading it I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book for anyone who knows someone or is suffering from an eating disorder. I know it helped me remember I wasn't alone and nearly every second I felt like it was me she was talking about. This book is amazing and has provided me with hope that things can get better. Thank you Portia de Rossi for sharing something so personal with the world.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Alex rates this game a 5. It is easy to play and he liked the music that played for blackheads
B009MCRHH6|5.0|very fun game, thinking game great for kids and adults would recommend to everyone. Cute characters and cute music great design.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much, this one is right &#34;up there&#34; with all the other books Hosseini has written. this deserves two thumbs up!!
B00B97SNJI|2.0|I've loved Dawes for a long time and I've resisted reviewing this. I gave it months of trying and it's just awful. It's like a record executive decided a good band needed to be peppier for a wider audience. This is Dawes trying to be something it's not and whoever arranged the percussion should be shot. lol I'm praying this is a phase and they go back because it was, for a while, my favorite band.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Wonderfully written, so engaging and thought provoking.  I turned page after page quickly, desperate to follow the lives of these characters.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Typical of her usual writing style. It was very moving and though provoking. I've seen several reviews say they wish there had been more insight into the Emily's depression and mindset. In my opinion it's perfectly clear.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|The movie kicked a$$!!!! But I'm mostly super excited that most of the movies and shows have closed captions!!!! Thanks for finally getting captions amazon! I will for sure be ordering tons more movies And TV shows!!!! YESSSS!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Doesn't work on Kindle HD, stick with MX player...at least it will play most video files.  aVai won't even start the videos
1451695195|5.0|I had a death experience and this is the first book that I identified with.  The book has apparently caused controversy but I thoroughly enjoyed it and felt much better about my own experience.  I too was in a dark tunnel and saw a light at the end.  The doctors were able to revive me before I went into the light.  I recommend this book.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Awesome app for Kindle! Amazing recipes and how awesome that Amazon offered it free! Thank you James Oliver for the new and exciting recipes! :)Great value! Kudos!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was not filled with sex and violence like most programs now.  The people were very interesting and believeable.<br />Need more shows like this.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very simple and straightforward app that works great!I You have to be careful to make sure the decimal point goes thru at times but otherwise it is very nice and I like the big easy buttons.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|This second in the Beautiful Creatures series still isn't well-written (read: teeth-clenching, fourth-grade level English, at best), but these ladies know how to keep a reader entertained! I love the series enough to overlook the poor editing, so give it a shot.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I use an alarm clock almost everyday but this one just rocks it plays music for how ever long and it works wonders but it may not be for everybody
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was an enjoyable read.  My kids recommended it and it was a good summer book to keep me occupied.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Great calendar app for Kindle! Wow! User-friendly and very convenient! Great way to stay organized! Thank you Amazon for a great free app! Hooray!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|great for magic lovers who don't necessarily want to buy tons of stuff!!!!!!!! highly recommend. will buy full version soon.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|As an adult, this game is fun although it is a bit stressful.  I found myself screaming at points during the game, and then after I crashed, wanted to try and do better.  I was annoyed at the constant ads and the parts where they want you to buy upgrades and purchase more features.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This mine craft is awesome! my friend found diamond's!  I wish there<br />We're caves in it.  WHY did they never put caves in it?but it's still AWSOMENESS!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would recommend to watch.  Just watching the transition to modern times without losing dignity.  Love Maggie Smith. Can't wait for the new season.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game. Plays like a real coin drop machine. My brother recommended it. Can't give it 4 and a half stars , so it gets five.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Great version of Angry Birds...Ad-free! Thank you Amazon for putting out a free ad-free version! Awesome! Its refreshing not to have ads popping up through the game!
B0058VW36U|5.0|LOVE THIS GAMEEEEE!!!! ITS A MUST GET! PLEASE MAKE THE OTHER ONES FREEEEEEEEE!!!!! YOU HAVE TO GET THIS GAME! ITS AWSOMEE!!!!!!! :D
B00EDF43MY|5.0|Although you kind of have to figure out how the game works by exploring it, it's really fun and educational.  There's not so much of any of the airport chores that you feel overwhelmed, and about the time you tire of one task, it's time to move on.  Really cute graphics and the &#34;Yeah!&#34; of the passengers as you help them through the airport really seemed to satisfy my 2 year old grandson!  It's learning while having fun, which is the way it should be!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Awesome book. I recommend it. Cassandra Clare knows how to write amazing books. I love this book.
B003V9OCIS|4.0|Unlike the nay Sayers, I feel that the movie - and that's what it is - not a documentary - was very well made. I loved watching it. Held my breath many times. I never found a dull moment during the full 2 hour running time.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Awesome I recommend it a lot I haven't seen a lot of games like this for the kindle!<br />I bet others will agree
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|What a great drawing pad! Awesome for Kindle! Good for adults and children! Thank you Amazon for putting out such a great free app for your anniversary! Calendar has many convenient features! Kudos!
B000L212HC|5.0|This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, a lot of magic and suspense, Hugh and Christian great performance.
B003XCVQ3C|3.0|Have not used it much but it was a delicate and beautiful in the transfer of the screen and I thought the price was greatly exaggerated and not worth the price
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Howey weaves an interesting tale of survival and conflict in an environment that keeps unraveling new dimensions/context. In this way (and only in this way), it reminds me of how Clarke sucked me into the unraveling world of Rama in Rendezvous with Rama, eager for the next discovery of this environment.<br /><br />I honestly was expecting something a bit different but far happier with what I got. I had trouble putting it down.
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|This isn't a \\"make me think\\" movie, nor is it a seat jumper, it has just  enough hand to hand, suspense and \\"what was that\\" to make it enjoyable.  What I didn't enjoy was the cliched and over acted role of  his \\"seemingly\\"  disaffected, neglected, put upon, spoiled daughter.  Had I not been afraid of missing something, I'd have fast forward through each and every scene she was in.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to entertain you, rather than veg out to, it's a good movie.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great story, well written. I couldn'y put the book down. Baldacci wove an interesting tail. A an easy read that was intriguing.
B002SHD9E2|4.0|This movie version was almost as good as the Broadway musical. I just loved it. It was GREAT! My favorite Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Book was good, but found that it had way to many, lengthy details..  villain was a total shock.  Never saw it coming.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I love this game, it's very addictive and fun to play, especially on a long trip.  You will have fun playing it
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Truly in my top ten, I highly recommend and look forward to reading more of Moyes' books. Run, don't walk, to get this book and read it.
B004478AS4|5.0|This is the first book by Achebe that I have read and thought it was a great view in to Africa during the time of colonization.  Very entertaining and an easy read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author has a gift for bringing life to the Afghan world of real people and the sufferings they endure at the hands of the region's maniacal power-brokers. He does this, amazingly, in a way that fills the heart with a sense of compassionate brotherhood--an important counterpoint to the uneducated hatreds, biases, and prejudices the flames of which the media fan with such morbid satisfaction.  Both Pari's, Abdullah, Nabi, the Wahdati's, Thalia---they are now people of my heart and can never again be faceless people whose lives I ignore as the war in their country drags on. And on. And on.  In this, as in both of his previous books, I am left with heartbreaking clarity about the human carnage of the political insanity that keeps manufacturing wars, but also about the incredible courage and resilience of us humans--and a renewed awareness that we are, in fact, all one.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins'  always comes up with new locales, new subject matter, for this book is no exception. The imminent destruction of the world sends Sigma Force into areas of the world not seen & seldom written about. It's easy getting a good education while having a good time reading!  The characters are real. Three-dementional people you learn to care about quickly. Keep yoiur evening free---you won't want to put it down once you've started reading. Highest rating!!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Fantastic film and the extras were marvelous. Blu ray is so lifelike. It's as if I am watching on a stage. It's crystal clear.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it was so fun I wanted to play it every day I hope you love it love it love it
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|complete time waster but fun. self explanatory,pretty colors. similar to numerous other games and free. no goal no prizes just dragon eggs
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Morgan, definitely was not the typical morgan in this one. Rather see him on SyFy.  Cruise is still having Top Gun flash backs.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|What a brave and strong woman. she is a testament to the human spirit of survival. We should read as many of the stories of this horrendous time in history so we never forget. I would like to say so we won't repeat history but horrible things are still happening all over the world still.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|this is a pretty good game with decent graphic.  reminds me of old windows 3.11 games.  recommend this game for all ages.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This true story of Cheryl Strayed's journey on the Pacific Crest Trail is not just a narrative of a wilderness hike undertaken by an unprepared hiker, but also a touching glimpse into Cheryl's journey through the grief of losing her mother.  Thank you Cheryl for sharing your story with us.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Fun show. Love the character development. Easy to fall in love with everyone's unique traits. 2nd season, here I come.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Great story, historically accurate. A worthwhile slice of the Holocaust to know about.<br /><br />Typical Spielberg movie:  brilliant. What a talent.
B000W93CHC|4.0|This book is a great follow up to pillars of the earth.  It is a real page turner that grabs you from the beginning.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a very enjoyable hidden object game. It leads you along the story as you have to find objects to continue on. Besides the h o puzzles you also have other types to solve for other levels. Enjoyable with various levels of difficulty.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I play this with my grandkids, its pretty good. There are however better games out there, but they like it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Just as good as the first book in the series, if not better!! Can't wait to find out what happens next!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Keeps Me happy on my down time.  I have always liked the game since I was a little girl.  Oh, I still am a little girl.
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|I liked the movie, when they coming out with the next one? Why do I need to put in 8 more words? I said what I wanted to.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I got this game for my kids but found I'm playing it more than they are! Kind of addicting and reminds me of my childhood.
B009HNDTPO|5.0|Awesome there are no other words needed, its the best of shows I have ever seen.!!!<br />So much intensity put into it, amazing !
B009CF7JDU|5.0|A classic. Iconic.  For Ferrari lovers and lip syncers.  Juvenile and silly, but aren't we all from time to time?
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Game is exciting to play, just to see if you can get a higher score than the other people that are playing. It also testes your skills to see how fast you can use hand and eye coordination.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A little creepy. Good character development. Twist and turns. Good page turner. A bit of Law and Order in there. Some kids parents.
B0087GF8ZG|1.0|We purchased this product in hopes of it turning on when the baby, to alert us, or us, checking on the baby, moved around it. This product would occasionally turn on but only at night with no other lights on. Also, it is extremely bright and harsh for a &#34;night light&#34;.
0385495323|4.0|\\"The Code Book\\" is an introduction to and overview of the history and evolution of codes through the ages by Simon Singh, whose background is in physics and journalism. Singh presents 6 chapters, each addressing a distinct topic. He begins with the encrypted communication from Mary Queen of Scots to her co-conspirators that led to her execution in 1586, after it was intercepted and decrypted. This chapter digresses into a history of secret writing and codes up to that point, including explanations of successful transposition and substitution ciphers and the advances in cryptanalysis by the Arabs and then Europeans that made the old codes vulnerable, unfortunately for the Scottish Queen.<br /><br />This state of affairs naturally led to a search for a stronger cipher, and an interminable contest between codemakers and cryptanalysts ensued. The second chapter discusses the invention of the polyalphabetic Vigen&egrave;re cipher by a 16th century French diplomat and its cracking in 19th century England and Prussia. Chapter three discusses the \\"mechanization of secrecy\\" during World Wars I and II, driven by the need for better codes in the era of wireless communication. The author talks about the invention of Enigma, a machine based on scramblers, in Germany and the efforts to crack the German codes in Poland and in England during World War II.<br /><br />Chapter four discusses some successful efforts to decipher dead languages and how obscure languages have, in fact, been used as codes where scrambling machines were impractical. Namely, he talks about the 420 Navajo \\"code talkers\\"  who were employed by the United States military in the Pacific to transmit spoken coded messages during World War II.  That brings us up the digital era in cryptography, when computers replaced mechanical encryption and key distribution became cumbersome, leading to the next revolution: the invention of public key cryptography. For a detailed account of this legendary story, also see Steven Levy's \\"Crypto\\" (2001).<br /><br />Chapter six addresses the \\"crypto wars\\" of the 1990s and the distribution of an accessible encryption program, Pretty Good Privacy, by Phil Zimmerman in 1991, the emergence of \\"cypherpunks\\", and some predictions for the future of cryptography. \\"The Code Book\\" is very readable and not very long at around 250 pages. It doesn't discuss advanced cryptography or require any particular mathematical skills to understand. Yet Simon Singh excels at explaining how ciphers work and how decrypting them works to laypeople. He doesn't gloss over the new ciphers and cryptanalysis in each chapter but explains them clearly with examples. There is also a nice list of further reading at the back.\\"Crypto\\" (2001).<br /><br />Chapter six addresses the \\"crypto wars\\" of the 1990s and the distribution of an accessible encryption program, Pretty Good Privacy, by Phil Zimmerman in 1991, the emergence of \\"cypherpunks\\", and some predictions for the future of cryptography. \\"The Code Book\\" is very readable and not very long at around 250 pages.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is awesome fun! Slots and different boards make it never a dull moment! It passes the time quite well and I enjoy chatting with others around the world.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is fabulously written, researched and organized.  It speaks to all of us introverts out there.  I would recommend it to anyone else who has always felt that extroverts think introverts are just failed versions of themselves!  If we would just socialize MORE and talk MORE and LOUDER, we'd be so much happier.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Happy to have on kindle. Have on my iphone and enjoy it there also. . It is light & refreshing when in the mood for a short game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was something my teenaged son and his friends raved about so much that my husband and I tried it and LOVED it.<br />Very addictive and thought provoking!
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Don't usually watch something with this much violence but this show just grabbed me and now I can't wait for the new season to start.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story with superb writing and actors! This BBC production is the primary reason we have Amazon Prime, although Prime offers additional benefits such as other movies and shows as well as two-day shipping on most of our orders. That's a great combination!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game is a lot of fun and keeps you interested its a little addicting too<br />So enjoy! I also like that it isn`t repetative
0756405890|5.0|This book is just so mesmerizing. One of my absolute favorite books, and the very book that inspired me to start writing. I actually originally purchased the digital format, then purchased a print copy just so I can reread it properly.<br /><br />As lengthy as it is, after a first few chapters, I was already dreading the end. Kvothe is such a lovable character. Though I didn't feel like I could connect with him, oddly enough, that was actually completely fine. Kvothe is an exceptional young man, and I felt it more appropriate to look up to him in awe and revere him as the lute-playing genius that he is than empathizing with him as a fellow human being. I think Rothfuss balanced this out well with the present-day Kvothe - someone much more vulnerable, more human, more like us.<br /><br />The world that Rothfuss builds is fascinating as well, though much of the story takes place in a relatively small and confined area. The other characters are interesting - some more interesting than others. I did feel that the story progressed slowly (if at all) sometimes, and there were many unanswered questions and unaddressed gaps. It is a series after all, but those who are not too keen on loose ends may feel frustrated that you have seemingly touched only the very tip of the iceberg. Regardless, this was a fantastic read, and I highly recommend this to anyone.
B00A81MV3U|3.0|It was confusing in the beginning of the movie but got better towards the end. I would not recommend to friend.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A fun and intriguing read. Well written in a believeable style with original characters. Made me want to read other books by the same author.
B00992CF6W|4.0|i liked the game but i didn't like the price, i would rather pay 5 dollars. 7 dollars is a bit too much.
B00DY951RQ|4.0|I own about 80% of Dylan's catalog and was excited about this release.  I sprang for the 4-disc deluxe version.  I was let down.  What you actually get for the money is disappointing at best.  The actual 2 discs of outtakes are great, especially some of the undubbed versions of the Self Portrait songs.  Had he released a compilation like this in 1970 instead of Self Portrait, it would have been a classic for sure.  The Isle Of Wight disc is garbage.  It was not a good concert to begin with and the remix does nothing to make it better other than maybe a slightly crisper sound.  Even then, it's not by much.  There's a reason it was never released as an official live album in 1969.  The Band is sloppy and they and Dylan both sound like they are drunk throughout the entire set.  I wouldn't listen to it more than once or twice.  My opinion only.  You may enjoy it.  The remaster of Self Portrait makes it sound a lot better but, that doesn't dismiss the fact that it's not that great of an album.  Had he omitted the cover songs, the instrumentals and trimmed it down to a single record back in 1970, the highlights could have made a pretty decent album.  Maybe not great, but I think he would have never gotten the \\"What is this s***?\\" review.  New Morning was a step in the right direction but, again, not perfect.  Fans embraced Nashville Skyline but, it was too short.  I have no clue why more songs from those 1969 sessions with Johnny Cash were not included.  Overall, I say save your money and stick with the 2-CD outtakes only version.  You're paying a lot more money to get nothing essentially worthwhile.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book very much. I have always wanted to read it (loving the movie so much) and now that i have i will recommend it to everyone.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love it, but it really needs to have more stuff in creative mode. TNT should be able to explode when you set it on fire. Also, there should be more stuff from the pc edition like wolves and fishing rods.  Either way, I still love the game.
B001ENS0BI|4.0|I started the shows later, halfway through season 1. I got addicted and watched pretty much all 4 seasons in a few weeks. My favorite season by far was season 3. My least favorite season was season 4. The ending was okay.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book! Covers interesting topics/themes and does it well with real, believeable characters. Had to ration it out to make it last as long as possible, and it was still over way too soon. Hoping for a sequel!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I completed the 10 levels and don't want to have to wait for the new levels!<br />One of the best games on my Kindle Fire, and it was FREE :)
1579128149|3.0|There are some nice colour piccies in this book but some of those radioactive elements are a bit sus.  They can't seem to find too much of them in nature.  Perhaps they are just &#34;energised&#34; forms of other elements.  And those lanthanides, they are all very similar so there is probably fewer of them than they think.  Overall I think that the periodic table is smaller than thought and the arrangement of the atoms is just a party joke.  Stay tuned for a better book on the elements than this one.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy the games from G5, especially the free ones! Love playing hidden object games. Just started playing but off to a good start.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Cast of old Favorites.  Gratuitous violence.  good fight scenes.<br /><br />the gun violence is so over the top it could not possibly offend anyone.<br />the large population of people handling Plutonium with no side effect harly crossed my mind.
B003THJA1G|5.0|I've watched Castle since it started airing on television.  Its nice to be able to watch it in HD any time I want, as long as I have an internet connection.
