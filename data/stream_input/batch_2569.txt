B00ADS98FC|5.0|I watched this with my family.  A few comments were over our childrens heads.  The music was fantastic. Definately recommend.
B003EVWDR0|4.0|I love the detailed depiction of another world. The story and special effects make for a scintillating movie that will stay with you.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|It has some minor bugs once in a while like do not open properly or froze, but it works fine most of the time...
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I didn't like this book but by the time I realized it, I was fully invested at 50% and forced myself to finish it thinking it just might surprise me with a good ending. Not. It went on and on and on and there were so many characters described in depth with pages and pages dedicated to them that made me think of 7 degrees of Kevin Bacon. I have read all three of his books so far and I should have stopped at The Kite Runner which would have left me thinking he was Hosseini was a great author.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|While I loved this book, it leaves me wanting to know more from Christian's perspective.  I'm sorry it's the last book.
B008PZZV8S|4.0|Few grusome scenes but otherwise very decent movie. Matt Diamon and Jude Law performed excellent roles. Gwyneth Paltrow and Gate Blanchett played very lovly companions to the main charachters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft it is such a fun game even through there is stuff you can do it is still a fun game.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|Simplest and best podcast app for the kindle fire!<br />I always had issues adding the podcasts I want with other apps.
B008220D5K|2.0|This is a 30-minute sitcom material spread over 2+ hours to pose as a semi-serious satire. Overly simplistic and repetitive, it will bore you to death!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is awesome and fun for everyone u should get it this game rocks and so I give it 5 stars!
B00BI5J9BC|4.0|Beautifully filmed, Anne Hathaway richly deserved her Oscar, and gorgeous costuming.  Hugo Jackman was wonderful in his portrayal of a man hounded by the law.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Meryl Streep is great in this movie considering how old she was when she made it. The guys really sing like a wounded raccoon, which makes it even more charming.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|Love this band, love this new CD.Would recommend it to any Phoenix lovers!<br />Best prices at Amazon.com. Got this one used once. Like me I rip it once and burn CD's<br />Like new :)
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Fantastic book, very authentic style and easy read. James is an inspiring force and many can benefit by reading this
B000QRIGLC|5.0|It was a very good read. Very informative and fast moving. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is proud to be an American.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Hard to follow not as good as the typical DeMille novel I've come to appreciate,  Drop the character humor and work on  the guy we learned to like on Plum Island or chasing the Lion.
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|I haven't seen this movie yet so can't say a thing about it.  I did buy this combo for the digital copy.  After buying and going through the steps to download, there wasn't an option to import to iTunes.  Apparently, UltraViolet doesn't support downloading to iTunes or to the iPad via ANY ap.  So, if you are buying this version to have it accessible through iTunes, don't waste your money.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was so excited this book came out. I was excited to keep reading about Eva and Gideon. There love story took a twist not expected and just when you think things are getting to sappy they get interesting and then the book ends leaving you wanting more. Now I have to wait for another book to come out.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|This second CD is awesome.I recommend it to anyone that loves Vampire Weekend! It was in awesome shape, got it used, ripped once and sold to me, I do the same thing. Rip it, and burn to to another CD and send it to my IPOD
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What's not to love about this. It adds, subtracts, divides, multiplies and does percentages. And it is free. You can't go wrong with this app!!
0307476073|5.0|Great fun, entertaining adventurous tale.  I am happy to find a book to share with most of my friends - good gift book.
B00CFO7PK2|5.0|I am biased, but absolutely stunning album. 5 own compositions. No Lo Se, with Pat Metheny, is a beautiful extra. Highly recommended!
B008XKT9FG|3.0|The movie was ok, but not something I'd watch again.  I was a little slow and left too many unanswered questions.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love the game it is full of mystery and the way the people act is strange all nice it's just creepy
B000KZFMZI|5.0|This is a great series. Everyone in the family loves watching, young to old. Great product, high quality and best part it arrived instantly.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|After seeing JT perform live with his band lately on TV, my husband and I were a little disappointed with the studio versions of the songs.  Still good but a little too much of the &#34;same old same old&#34; as far as modern hip hop production goes.  Love the soul and the talent of JT and his band, though, when they play live.  Will definitely get his DVD of his tour!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This was an unexpected delight.  A fast-moving, hilarious tale filled with satiric references to scores of famous sci-fi movies.  A delightful cast, with exceptional performances by Pegg, Frost, Jason Bateman, Jane Lynch and the funniest bit by Sigourney Weaver.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|My kids and I have watched this movie I don't even know how many times. It has a great message, fantastic music, interesting characters, and is just plain fun. Love, love, love it!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a great movie with wonderful cast.  Its definitely worth the watch...action packed and humorous.. can't wait to see the sequel!
B0040NOWY8|4.0|I haven't had any issues burning 30GB+ of data to the disks.  The package is all written in Japanese, but when was the last time you read your media blank package?
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Movie received real quick, within a couple of day.  This is a really good series, high quality and makes a great gift.
0307895475|5.0|This guide is possibly the fattest guide book ever made to date. It made a good present for my cousin's birthday.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app. I have been rerding ebooks for over 2 years now. I have read about 10 ebooks using my Kindle app. My only complaint deals with the reader itself, my Xoom, which becomes quite heavy over time. I am now thinking seriously about purchasing a Kindle reader.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK; I WOULD READ IT AGAIN I'M GOING TO LOOK UP ANOTHER BOOK WRITTEN BY THE SAME ARTHUR. I TOLD MY SON ABOUT IT AND HE READ IT AND LOVED IT ALSO. WHAT MORE CAN I SAY
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a great game with a few flaws. I don't like how you have to wait a whole month for a new theme but I love how there even is a theme! This is One of my favorite games definitely!
B0026QC0TA|4.0|It is a well made film with outstanding acting.  However, I would love to see a movie where the bad guys aren't always corporate swine.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I can't believe all the bad reviews.  I like it so much I saw it twice in the theater and I'm so glad that it is finally getting released.  Fun story, great visuals and I liked the cast.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun game but difficult to play especially on a smaller screen like an iPhone....a little better on the iPad where it is a larger screen.
1878424319|4.0|Great for graduates and adults alike. Catch him on Oprahs network. It makes it easier to follow him and understand
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I hadn't heard of this movie but it was quite good. A pleasant surprise with some talented actors in the cast.
0544139453|3.0|\\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" by Mohsin Hamid takes you though the life of a young Pakistani, Changez, who has come to the United States. The story follows this man before and after the tragedy of 9/11 and how it affects Changez's life. In my opinion, this was a good book that I could really relate to being Pakistani.<br /><br />This story starts in the middle of day in Lahore, Pakistan when Changez notices an American man and starts to tell him his story. The identity of the American remains a mystery thought the book. Changez's story starts in New York where he has just graduated from Princeton and applies for a job at a company called Under Samson. After he gets the job he meets a writer named Erica who he falls in love with. Then on September 11th 2001, the twin towers collapse and in a way so does Changez's life in America. People treat him differently and a lot of his co workers avoid him. Then he finds out that unfortunately, Erica does not love him because she cannot get over her dead ex boyfriend. With his life completely changing in front of his eyes he makes an important decision that greatly affects his life. This book had an amazing writing style where the main character was telling you his story and the time shifted from past to present in each chapter. This book also great insight on how life was like after 9/11. However that being said, this book was often very dry and boring with too much detail in parts that did not need to be highlighted so much.<br /><br />This book can be categorized in the memoir genre because it is written with that kind of writing style. The targeted age would be adult. I think that personally it would appeal to Pakistani's more because they could relate to the book more, however the book gives enough explanation that it would be easy for other people to follow as well.
0061692042|1.0|While I can see from the editorial reviews that the author's colleagues are gushing over this book, I found the book plodding from one very lackluster chapter to the next.  I was hoping by page 100 I would start caring about the main character, and then 200 and then 300. But he's really a pathetic adolescent who was unfortunate enough to have total losers for parents.  I found the prose tedious and deadly slow like a long parable describing how corn grows, inch by painful inch.  It's one of the first books that I have actually gotten to within 30 pages of finishing and finally gave up.  I wasn't going to waste one more minute of my reading experience on this dreadful book.<br /><br />Greg Fitzgerald
B0054SMID0|4.0|I liked it. I had actually seen it before and wanted to see a movie with Matthew McConaughey. I recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is easy to play and fun!  It is self explanatory!  Just like playing solitaire with real cards, the old fashioned way now :)
B0096BIENY|5.0|Great motivational music. It can be listened to for hours at a time. I got to see them and they are worth every penny
B001DHXT6G|5.0|DVDs worked perfect arrived earlier than expected great for any fan of the original series full screen and lots of awesome bonus features thanks
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|There will never be enough Avery Brooks or Rene Auberjonois.  Plus, I always like the idea of a space station---with all respect to BABYLON FIVE---peopled by Federation officers and citizens from across the galaxy.<br />The opening episodes are my favorites because we get so much back-story on everyone that comes in handy down the line.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My daughter already has the hard cover copy and she also wanted to have it on her Kindle so we already knew what we were getting.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I got this because it was the free app of the day on my amazon kindle fire hd. I love puzzles and have been doing them since I was 2. I put the puzzles on the 200 pieces and rotate. They were nice because they weren't extremely easy like I thought they would be. My only recommendation is to have more puzzles.
B000W4KSVA|5.0|I love Jazz and this is a must have for the personal Jazz collection! So relaxing and refreshing!! Loved it!!

B0052UYJDC|5.0|Love this book.  Lots of great ideas on how to live a minimalist.  I have used most of her tips and it works. Highly recommend.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I had been looking forward to the third book in this series since I finished book 2. It was highly disappointing.
B0053TMP24|5.0|My daughter already has the hard cover copies but wanted to also have it on her Kindle so we already knew what we were getting.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I remember reading this book a very long time ago. I wanted to go see the new movie about it but I wanted to reread the book first. It is a very good book and would recommend to almost anyone.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I've never played the original Temple Run, but this one is really fun. My only complaint is that the movements on the Kindle are really sensitive. Moving it slightly either doesn't register and he runs off the edge or it does register at the wrong time and he turns when he's not supposed to. Other than that, great game.
B009UQCD0K|3.0|I have watched this show since the beginning since I do enjoy zombie movies.  It was mostly average with some flaws every now and then which are typical of shows and movies today.  I will not be watching no more after the last episode of the 3rd season.  Can't believe a group of people just watch one man gun them all down while themselves have guns very capable of shooting him.  Beyond stupid
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Cooler Master is the real McCoy in cooling solutions, I was unsure about what heat dissipation brand and model to install in my extreme core desktop, but prices for other brands are way to expensive (Corsair, Zalman, NZXT, Thermaltake, etc) it was so simple to install, and it works so quiet and smooth, since installed my CPU temperature goes as low as 10 degrees when idle, never before get a low temperature like this.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|\\"Man of Steel\\" looks to be very different from any previous Superman films, and so it requires a different style of music.<br /><br />If anyone is right for the project, it's composer Hans Zimmer.  Zimmer has been involved with some of my favorite movies in recent years - The Dark Knight, Inception, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Gladiator.  With the Dark Knight Trilogy, he successfully created a new tone that was different from any previous Batman music.  It appears he has done the same for the Man of Steel.  Everybody loves John Williams' theme for the original Superman films - to try and replicate it would be a mistake.  So Zimmer does the only sensible thing, and goes in a completely different direction with his score.<br /><br />Every track on this album has something unique to offer; there is great variety, and that makes for a pleasant listening experience.  There is plenty of the intense epic music that Zimmer is known for (those who have accused him of being too bombastic in the past will no doubt have the same complaint here).  But there's also plenty of emotion too - some of my favorite cues are the softer ones.<br /><br />As a bonus, you get a 28-minute track called \\"Hans' Original Sketchbook\\", which features some of Zimmer's key musical concepts, plus some early ideas and a bit of music unused in the film (although much of it sounds like pieces from other tracks on the album).<br /><br />Also, for those wondering where the music used in the film's trailer can be found, it's the track titled \\"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\\" - Track #17 (or Track #1 of Disc 2 for the limited edition CD).<br /><br />The superhero genre is full of great music, and the \\"Man of Steel\\" soundtrack is right up there with the best of them.  I highly recommend this album!<br /><br />FAVORITE TRACKS<br />[5] Goodbye My Son<br />[6] If You Love These People<br />[16] Flight<br />[17] What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?<br /><br />* The Deluxe Edition of the soundtrack, available in physical CD format or in MP3 format, contains an additional 6 tracks (approx. 30 minutes in length) not included on the regular release.<br /><br />** Also included with purchase of the CD is an insert with a unique code to download the Man of Steel Soundtrack in the Z Plus App.  This is the first soundtrack album to use the new DTS technology called Headphone:X - which simulates an 11.1 channel surround mix on a normal pair of headphones.

B0064QNS62|4.0|I like this game and thought it is very fun. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I couldn't figure out what the object of the game was at first. It would be nice to have a demo level first.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I think this movie is by far the best of the 3 Christopher Nolan Batman series. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker is so good, it's scary. LOVE IT.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great family movie that everyone can watch.  Came in perfect condition, no dents in the case or scratches on the DVD.
B00846REIS|5.0|I just love the way Sylvia Day writes I just can't put her books down and really can't wait for the 3rd in the series to come out.
1781162646|1.0|I'm sure once I read this (when and if it is released digitally) I'll give it a high rating as I've pretty much have read and loved everything King has written dating back to his first published book.  However, I refuse to buy the paperback.  I think King has thumbed his nose at thousands (millions??) of his loyal readers just because he remembers reading these types of books in paperback.  What hogwash!!!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loovvee this series and loved the second book! If you liked Matched, you will love Crossed. Cassia, Ky, and Xander have the best love story and I couldn't wait to see what happened to them.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|This was a very good movie, I'm sad it didn't get the showing I think it should have.  It was well acted and had a good plot.  To bad, I recommend  this movie.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love this DVD, but I am a huge fan of Supernatural. Anyone that enjoys anything about the supernatural and hot guys should watch this.

0307730700|4.0|\\"There are enough books that show how tough SEAL training is, there's enough Tom Clancy fiction.  What there isn't enough of is the humanity.\\"<br />This sentence in the Prologue pretty much sums up this book in its essence, `humanity'.<br />Much more than describing how tough of a SEAL and individual Adam Brown was, this book pulls back and shows what we rarely get to see when hearing about hero's and that is exactly what Eric Blehm has accomplished with this book.<br />I was captivated from start to finish from his early childhood to the final days as a SEAL.<br />This is the type of man that our children should know about and set as their role models.  Not these movie actors, rappers and others in the spotlight that most don't have a clue about sacrifice and heart. This is the real deal, heartfelt, genuine and a book that is sure to get the most hardened reader pulling at their heartstrings.<br />A review of this book seems so lacking, this is something you must just sit down and read.
B006YGC7KK|4.0|If you enjoyed the first season, then I think that you will enjoy this one. Blu Ray PQ and AQ both excellent
B00A9ET4MC|3.0|I found it boring and not very engaging. Her first 2 books were much better. I did not enjoy it very much

B00571F26Y|4.0|This book does a good job of explaining a number of health issues in our day. It also gives clear and simple instructions to get out from under our wheat dilemma. The examples shared of regained good health of those who've followed this plan are encouraging.

B000TGCR38|5.0|Great movie. Tells a love story during the war as well. kinda sad ending but I guess thats how it went.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Megadeth like always comes out with a gem of an album. The best thing about this band is that every album of theirs sounds different...and so does this one.<br /><br />Super Collider is not a thrash record.....it has that melodic vibe of the 90's albums. So the fans of that era...rejoice!!<br /><br />-Dave Mustaine sounds so much better than the last few albums. On almost all songs here he sings in his lower tone (remember 'Angry Again') with a dark menace in the voice.<br />-Shawn Drover is the surprise package here....and excels on the drums.<br />-Chris Broderick...simply put is awesome. If you listen to each songs closely, he's free-flowing on the album with his guitar parts scattered all over in the background.<br />-David Ellefson is good as usual...the Bass is really think and prominent.<br /><br />Songs to look out for: ALL OF THEM. Buy the CD and you won't be dissappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book and couldn't put it down. Looming forward to the last. I hope it's as addicting as the first two.

B002N5N5QQ|4.0|Enjoying this series greatly. Flawed characters who manage to win you over, lose you, then win you over again despite yourself ;)
B001RNO7C6|3.0|I bought these for a trip to France. Expecting lots of walking in the rain I wanted a comfortable water proof shoe. The reviews were very high for this shoe so I thought i would try these. They are well made but seem to run  1/2 to 1 size smaller than ususal. I wear an 11.5 us most of the time but the size 12 I ordered is still a bit small. The showe is well made but I don't find it a very good walking shoe. The soles are quite stiff/hard and they are hard on your feet if worn for long walks. For the money they are a good shoe but not nearly as comfortable as I had hoped.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|It's fun and all I like it I just wish there were a way to get gems easier. and a way to reduce the cost of saving lives to change to make it more encouraging to keep playing.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This product does not work for my kindle. When I try to open it, a screen with the code opens up.

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Having two people in my life who suffer from bipolar disorder, this is a good interpretation of what the patient, and loved ones, go through. The two main characters each have their own issues, and you can see how those issues interfere with normal functioning. A lesson to learn: be honest with yourself and others. Life will be a lot easier.<br /><br />I can see how Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for her performance. Absolutely brilliant how she acted like Tiffany would (I think!).<br /><br />Beware though! F-bombs are plentiful! More so than I thought they needed. So be careful if younger ones are watching.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I'm a big fan of Will Smith, an adore Jeff G. For those reasons alone I would like this movie. throw in the humor of the supporting actors like Randy Q and others. It has a more up beat attitude of us at first being excited to greet the aliens till we find out their not friendly.  it is a feel good movie that doesn't pant us as the bad guy's.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Was told about this a year ago but didn't want a Facebook page which was required at the time. I found out they only require an email now so gave it a try.  However much I love it, it does seem to eat up a lot of time lol

B00AZKCU7G|4.0|This was a good movie because Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor and solely that.  How ever even with Lewis, the makeup was unforgivable.  Where was the deep lined faces of Lincoln?  The make up in Gangs of New Your was much superior.  Where was the background.  Where was Mary's mental break down?  Had any other actor have done this it would have flopped and been considered a failure.  Perhaps this should have been.  Can you hang a movie on just the name of a star and be considered a genius?<br /><br />I expected a GREAT DEAL MORE!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a movie that needs to be seen more than once, especially after the end, because (at least for me), a lot of questions popped up regarding timing/emergence of the animals. I would have preferred to have watched it again in a few hours, but because of the licensing, only 24 hours is allowed before being deleted from your devices, so with my schedule, able to watch only part of it again.<br /><br />Whether it proves the existence of God is up to the viewer. I believe in Him, so I could see it. Well told and beautifully filmed. Good acting, and refreshing to see some new faces on the screen.<br /><br />Too bad I did not see this at the theater, in 3D. I can see how beautiful some of the scenes were, and from other reviewers, they were absolutely breathtaking!
B009EFP278|5.0|I am always looking for something new in music to get me out of the rut and this did the trick.  I heard the song Troublemaker somewhere and looked it up, thank you Amazon, and there it was, never heard of the guy.  Great music really love all of it.  Kind of Maroon 5-ish but not too much.  Great new face to my music genre and will keep my eye on this guy and his music career.  Get it, go Olly!
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Another good one with that Reacher twist we like. I'm headed for the library to start Jack Reacher number 11
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This was a gift. I've never seen the movie but my daughter requested it. She says she is enjoying it.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I think Frey is a self-center D-head, but that's just me.  Watched it three times and will watch it again and again.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I mean, come on - right?  It's Stephen King.  One of the best storytellers of all time.  This lives up to it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|What am I supposed to write about this? It's a game, and it's OK. Ads are annoying, but then it's free, so I have to tolerate them. Easy enough to skip.
B008J34466|5.0|What can I say, it's PINK!  And you know what that means, fun, a little raunchy and real.  This woman is always amazing me with her talent and ability, and of course that perfectly toned body.  How does she do it?  Oh, I think I will have a baby, get right back into shape, record a new CD and go on tour.  I mean really, what an amazing artist.  Really great music that stands me on my head and gets me to rockin!
B000059H98|4.0|I am very pleased with the movie !  it arrived earlier than I thought it would which was a huge plus since it's one of my favorite movies !

B005PK553C|5.0|Takes up we're the twilight zone left off. Exciting and edge of your seat excitement. Worth watching. Do not watch lane.
B0011ZVVOM|4.0|I like this album a lot, has some great tunes. Would recommend it if you like blues/rock type stuff with heavy guitar riffs.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|It's everything you would expect from Queens, and then more.  Feel free to get very excited, because you won't be disappointed.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Although I found this to be  quite hard to start, it ended quite marvelously.  I can't wait to start the next book!
B00AJLHUA8|2.0|The plot of this movie is good and original. Unfortunately, the filmmakers ruined it with cheap photography tricks and having characters behave in ways that defied logic.<br /><br />The cheap photography trick was the lighting. I get that they were going for dark and foreboding. Unfortunately, they rushed past that at the speed of light and ran right into something that played like a guide book on how to not film a horror movie. Almost all of the scenes were so dark that when there actually was light, it was surprising. Like I said, I get that they were going for dark and foreboding. But this runs right into the other issue: behavior that defies logic.<br /><br />Now, let's say you think someone is in your house. You're creeped out and hearing noises. What are you going to do? Walk around a dark house or walk around flipping every light on as you go? The filmmakers went for the former every single time. It was very distracting from what was otherwise a great plot. Another example of behavior that defies logic: You're asleep and someone shines a flashlight in your face. This would wake normal people.<br /><br />So like I said, this movie could have been awesome.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Got this because Kid Rock was on it, but I love the whole cd, lots of good songs on it.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|I'm been a Bruce Lee fan since the green Hornet days.I saw Enter The Dragon 36﻿ times in 1973 I was 13 years old.A movie ticket was only 1.50 cents then...lol 40 year's after Bruce passing I don't only embrace Bruce Fighting prowess but more than that his philosophy of life.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best shows on tv. Always leaves me wishing for more.  Even though I hate it when it happens, I applaud the way they seem to have no problem killing off main characters.  Really looking forward to next season.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating...I thought it was really great. Some other reviews said the movie had bad acting....I don't agree with this, I thought it was fine.
1451695187|5.0|Fantastic book since it is based on actual facts.  How amazing for a person on the brink of non-belief to now, through first hand experience, believe in goodness on earth as well as an afterlife with his Creator.  Well written and easy to read.
B009GESJH2|5.0|This is a great cd, one of my favorites on the cd is the The Mirror, also Cocaine and Gin, Rebel Soul, well I guess I pretty much love all of them, but I am a big fan of Kid Rock.
B009POCG0Y|1.0|The nudity and blood were the good parts, the rest of it sucked. Matthew was ok, the rest of the unknowns were horrible. The story was worse.
B00009APK1|4.0|I ordered this tape from the used movie section and it came in great shape and plays very<br />well.  I have watched this movie several times and the tape has stood up to the wear and<br />tear of watching it so many times.
B000MR1V22|5.0|Great cast, great story, great acting.  This will become a classic.  This is a totally satisfying film-- I wouldn't change a thing.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|This movie was so powerful that I did not want to move for fear of missing something.  You want to see this!
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Purchased this for my granddaughter's 6th. birthday and she loves watching both movies.  What a great gift for a great price.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Loads of information about The Eagles.  Excellent flow of material. Great presentation of the band's evolution and music.  A great band.  Perfect!
B0034C9CFK|5.0|I teach line dancing, and use just about all the songs in my class.  This album has a nice mix of fast and slower songs which I like.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|I have been waiting for the release of this cd since I first heard of it.  I listen to it all the time.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|We own several copies of this film and when I need a good laugh, it's my &#34;go to&#34; movie!  Robert Downey, Jr. is beyond amazing!  Although I'm not a big fan of most of the other cast (but I did enjoy Brandon T. Jackson - first film I have seen him in), it works. And it works great!
B008J34466|5.0|I love Pink and her many styles of songs.  She is fun to watch when there is a chance.  Her CD's all have a different style.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You guys definitely need to make a 7.0!  the kindle fire comes with updates slower and the apple appstore already has 7.1! please fix this but otherwise very addicting and entertaining game
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|My sister read this book and I finally looked it up and downloaded it to my tablet.  Amazing story of an amazing life.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I really like this movie/documentary! It is something you can watch more than once and really do some thinking about. No words to sway your thoughts. It's great!
B008J9EYFG|5.0|I have always been a big fan of her music.  I own just about every song she's ever recorded.  I highly recommend this cd.
B004MPESSY|4.0|It's a messed up movie but revenge in movies is always good it's a must see and own and it's cheap
B001F0TM5I|5.0|Excellent for a &#34;Blood and Guts Movie Night&#34; with you buddies.<br /><br />Pros:  It's great to see Kurt Russell play a complete jerk who gets his &#34;justs rewards&#34; at the end.<br />Cons:  None
B006LSZECO|3.0|The author didn't seem to know how the story ended;  it went nowhere.  Were they stuck with each other or did one try to kill the ohter?
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was an interesting book to read.  It kept me thinking.  I liked the fact he had the science behind him to support his experience. I believe he tried to be as factual as possible (I believe him when he said he struggled to find the right words to explain something - that our vocabulary just did not contain the words) - I never felt preached to or manipulated, which was refreshing!  I'm glad I read it - I haven't stopped thinking about his experience since I finished the book.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am a scifi lover but aliens usually leave me cold. However, Falling Skies is the exception.  An alien invasion has left earth in tatters with bands of rebels fighting the aliens.  Think of this as The Walking Dead with Aliens instead of Zombies. Not only are there different kinds of aliens, they make really cool noises.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First time reading this book but loved it! Would recommend for anyone who loves action and romance! I'm all for Peeta and Katniss getting together. Love love love it!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This was such a true movie and so funny! I'm a big fan of Cameron Diaz and she was great in this movie as always in her others!
B003WKFAIW|4.0|I didn't think it was as good as their first CD but still good music.  Maroon 5 is one of the later groups this side of classic rock that I like.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Really liked this book. After finishing it I was so wanting a sequel and am now so excited to find out the author has written one!
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|I really don't like this app. The controls don't work well . It is obviously a copy off of mcpe and it really isn't fun. Good thing this was free or I would have been very,disappointed. I would not recommend this app hoops this was helpful
B000059T1V|5.0|Absolutely first-rate live versions of Mojo back-to-back- Muddy asked the crowd if they wanted to hear something else and apparently they wanted more Mojo! He and the band upped the intensity, and as they say, the crowd goes wild, which adds to the excitement. Check out the footage of this performance where Muddy dances with James Cotton at one point. I'm sure anyone who was there will never forget seeing and hearing this giant of American music at his best.
1439156816|5.0|Like most budding writers, I've endured my share of creative writing courses, university degrees, and countless writing guides/manuals, which for the most part, really share the same things. And then I found On Writing by Stephen King. No matter what you think of Kings fiction work, fan or not, if you're serious about learning your craft, buy this book. His own habits, which he talks about, have produced close to sixty published novels, spanned countless aclaimed films, and most impressively, redefined the genre he set out to conquer. But the real magic of this writing guide comes with Kings standard blue collared approach. From the man who once called himself 'the mac and cheese' of America's literati, King argues that writing is a process, and should be treated as nothing more than sweeping a shop floor. That no nonsense approach has worked for him. And, alongside countless other no nonsense habits (like taking 10% out of your work with every second draft), makes On Writing a treasure chest for both established and soon to be established writers alike. A must buy, and a bargain at whatever price you're buying it for.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|I have purchased many cartridges of Impossible Film in the past year and this shade is my favorite so far.  The color is exquisite if you know how to adjust the lighting on your Polaroid camera correctly.  It decelops faster than the silver shade in my experience, still about 20 minutes or so.  If you are on the fence about buying any of the Impossible Film cartridges I suggest this one first, it's a great color and you are left with a gorgeous photo.
B00C4QLUFM|5.0|Good movie! All time favorite. I bought it to watch in my ipod while working out. Watching movies while working out makes me burn more calories
0679805273|5.0|I gave this as a high school graduation gift.  Before I gave it to her, I read it.  It was a very cute book, suitable for all ages.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I do not like this app at all. It is not fun nor hard at any point of the game . It is also pretty buggy. I would not recommend this . Even though it is free,they should pay us for wasting space on it. I hope this was helpful
B00821OX98|4.0|Interesting premise and good execution. Like most fantasy/sci fi shows, there are some holes but nothing big enough to ruin it for me. Worth watching especially if you have Amazon prime
B009NY43NY|3.0|----SPOILERS AHEAD------<br />OK So like everyone else I was a little blind sided with the whole Sam thing.  I mean I thought he would have been a great match for Sookie in the first book.  Maybe Charlaine had this whole Sam & Sookie thing planned out from the beginning but it felt really thrown together at the last possible second. I felt a little let down with the Eric thing.  I am in the minority in saying that I was always a Bill fan.  I loved Bill, yes even after he did what he did.  It was explained over and over again through Eric's stupid actions.  Why did Sookie forgive all of Eric's crap but not Bill when she understood that he really had no choice?  I truely think Bill loved Sookie.  OH well coulda shoulda woulda.  I felt I owed it to Sookie to see how it all ended after all these years and now that I have I feel like maybe I should have stopped 2 adventures ago.  I always loved Sookie's bravery and the rose colored glasses she always seem to carry in her back pocket but I guess after her whole torture thing it would explain her change.  It kind of felt like she grew up but not in the way we thought she should have.  Charlaine, it must feel great to finish a whole series but as a loyal fan I feel like this book was really lacked the whole Sookie-ness that I loved so much.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved it, as the first two! I'm not going to spoil the story though! It took me to a whole new level of their relationship, deeper I would say. Absolutely amazing!
B003XMAD3G|5.0|It's hard to write a good review about RAM, largely because it works or it doesn't, but the price of this RAM was the best and it works perfectly in my Acer Chromebook A7.<br /><br />I noticed a performance increase when having multiple tabs opened on the Chromebook. Very happy with the purchase and the shipping was very fast.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I, Love, Love, Love, this movie. I cried through out and was moved to emotion. I can't wait to see the play.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|This game is pretty epic but it gets repetitive after a while. And they never seem to update this game. I would recommend this game for 4-7 year olds. I hope this reveiw was helpful-_-
B0018AT890|5.0|Bring Harry and the gang back when you listen to the music from the movies you love. Not my favorite movie, but the music is always great.
B00CFA225Y|1.0|Crappy story line.  Cheap special effects.  Don't waste your money!!!!  Bad acting. Cant say enough bad things about this movie. I am glad I watched it on Netflix so I didn't buy it and be horribly disappointed.
B00AEFY3MC|4.0|Hearing all the back stage stories about Star Trek conventions, this movie uses those stories as a back drop for it's plot.  But it has a nice twist in the plot.
0156027321|5.0|I don't know what moral words I can use to describe this book, let alone to get the point across that it is a priceless work of literary art.  But, that's not going to stop me from trying:<br /><br />I knew the main idea of Life of Pi before I actually read it, I think most people did.  It is a book about a teenage Indian boy who is shipwrecked and stuck on a lifeboat with a male Bengal tiger.  Normally, that would be enough for me to at to a to-read list of some sort.  But, I never did.  Until I saw the trailer for the movie, with it's amazing visuals.  Any book that could inspire such artistry must be worth reading.  I was right!  The book isn't just about Pi's ordeal with tiger, whose name is Richard Parker, it is indeed about his life.  Which I greatly enjoyed reading about.  The whole 356 pages could just have been about Pi's life, minus the bit about being stuck out at sea with a tiger, and I would have loved it just as much.  He lived a very interesting life.  He lived at zoo and therefore had a vast knowledge of animals.  As someone who loves animals, that was a plus.  I also greatly admired his character and personality.  Though, I have to admire Richard Parker too.<br /><br />All in all Life of Pi is a book I found very profound to read.
0060090367|1.0|All I could keep thinking as I was listening to this book was \\"Geez, get on with it already...\\" If I'd picked this up to read, I would've set it down after the first few chapters. How many different ways can one person go on and on about the same thing? Read this book and find out. After a bit, I completely understood why James left her.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Epic app. This app is amazing just like Spiderman. I lerv this app. It is second place though.I would Recommend this to anyone who likes Spiderman. I hope you found this helpful
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, I love all movies (good and bad) but this movie just struck me as weird. There was a lot going on and seemed like a conspiracy theory movie. Good acting, and all that good jazz... but everything else was just off. Especially about 3/4 way through. That's when it started getting weird.<br /><br />I would recommend this to a friend, but I would caution them that while it had great acting, scenes, and effects... that it was unusual.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|There were some funny parts and some boring parts. It's just an okay movie to me. It was kind of cute, the ending was pretty much the best part of the movie.

B008S80P38|5.0|It came in almost new condition, no scratches or physical damage to the disc, and a great new album to add to my collection
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The Help by Kathryn Stockett was a huge phenomenon in the literary world. It was one of those rare stories that captured the attention of readers across the board, and garnered critical and commercial success. It was no surprise, then, when the novel was optioned for a film adaptation.<br /><br />As the film begins, we meet Aiblileen (Viola Davis), a black maid maid working for a young, white family in Jackson, Mississippi, 1962. She carries a sense of wisdom, as she raises the young daughter of the family, her seventeenth white baby. Despite the loss of her son, he couldn't get the proper care in the \\"colored\\" hospital, Aibileen finds a kind of solace through her job, her faith, and her best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer). Minny is also a maid. While she is praised for her cooking skills, her sassy mouth has gotten her in trouble with previous employers, and finds her with no job and a husband who beats her regularly.<br /><br />Eugenia Phealan, Skeeter (Emma Stone), is a fresh out of college, 22 year old white woman, who has returned home, to her mother's dismay, without a husband. We learn that Skeeter has always had trouble fitting in with what society, and her mother, expect of her. Upon her return home, she is shocked to learn that the maid who raised her, Constantine, has left the family home, and no one seems to want to tell Skeeter what happened to her. Saddened by the loss of her childhood companion and eager to get a job at a big publishing company, Skeeter decides to write something important. After a chance encounter with Aibileen, Skeeter enlists her and her friends to tell their stories of being, \\"The Help\\" to white families.<br /><br />The movie is extremely faithful to the novel, becoming one of those rare films that truly seems to bring the story to life. The cast, from top to bottom, is splendid, each actor bringing sincerity and conviction to their role. The movie is extremely deserving of all of the hype and recognition that it received. Fans of the novel are sure to enjoy this adaptation.the novel are sure to enjoy this adaptation.
B000R9J3XE|4.0|It´s better than  I expected. Good sound and nice presentation for few dollars. I would by another pair soon. yeah
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A very good book!  I was not sure till the end what would happen.  Author was very convincing.  I enjoyed the style of writing and that it was from the father's perspective.
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|Every song sounds the same. They're all the same tempo. Slow. They never pick up the pace. Apparently they were trying to keep ozzy clean & sober. Bad idea! They should have forced him to shoot up and do coke! It sounds like sabbath but never changes up a bit. It was like a job listening to this album. The only good thing I can say is the production is awesome and they didn't sell out.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I loved this app!! Until a week or two ago Norton Security ran a scan and found this app has malware. Completely DESTROYED my kindle and had to send it back! DO NOT GET!
B003B02O0A|5.0|As always, John Grisham writes a compelling story with multiple layers that's deep seated with plot tension and tumultuous situations. An excellent read.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Fun way to waste some time but SLOW to move forward. Builds increase in cost and only if you spend real money can you grow &quot;quickly&quot;. Overall a decent game. Improvement I would like to see is a way to totally eliminate another player by allowing multiple NUMEROUS attacks.
B000UZ4EP2|5.0|I love this CD and had to replace the old copy I had!  I could not live without it!  Would do it again if needed!  Shipping was fast and the product was awesome.  Thank you!

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is by far the best series on TV. The acting is excellent the directing as well and the additional bits about how the series is made and the comments by everyone involved in making this wonderful slice of history mixed with fiction mixed with an episodic story line is superb. I can watch it over and over and over!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game and fun. You get to take care of your own horse and feed it and and groom it.
B00CFYD682|5.0|Although I have long enjoyed the varied musical career of Ms Moyet, this electronic wonder--though it is sometimes lauded as a return to her Yaz/Yazoo roots, is in fact a unique creation, something entirely its own. Every track is incredible, which is why it is difficult to choose favorites--I literally love them all. As the weeks have passed, I have come to especially enjoy \\"Rung By the Tide,\\" and this week, I'm hooked on the darkly wonderful \\"Right As Rain,\\" which has beats nothing short of addictive and lyrics that somehow sparkle with despair (\\"If you can't be happy with me/Be unhappy with me/Stay unhappy with me...\\")--set to music so upbeat you can't help but move to it! Similarly, I was hooked from the start on the one track she gave away on her Web site, \\"Changeling\\"--the sound is at once such a departure for her, at least from her more recent sound (musically), but that voice shines through and they meld seamlessly.<br /><br />Ms Moyet's versatility is well known to listeners who have long enjoyed her talents, and--as one of those--I believe she's great at any sort of music she sets out to do; even so, I have to admit that I was not expecting exactly THIS sort of music from her...and I'm so glad she decided to try going in this direction. I can't recall feeling quite this way about an album before--I'm compelled to tell friends about it, and write about it on social media, and have bought multiple copies to give as gifts...it's really just so good that I can't keep it to myself.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games trilogy and could not stop reading. I thought the books got better as they went on. Of course now the movie will not be able to live up to the book.

0756407915|4.0|Like most everyone else, while reading A Wise Man's Fear, I never found myself bored, or skipping pages, but when it was finished, I was highly unsatisfied.  I felt I had been on an interesting journey, only to end up back where I started.  Yes we learned more of Kvothe's back story, but we made no progress forward.  This had better be far more than a trilogy if Rothfuss doesn't want a pack a ravening readers torching his home.  There is a lot more back story, which HAS to include more on the Chandrian and Amyr.  And he has to move the story forward... Kvothe may be \\"waiting to die\\", but we all know we won't accept him going \\"peacefully into that good night.\\"  His waking from his lethargy (throwing the fight with the soldier's sucked) and going back out into the world (he does, doesn't he?) to live or die, is worth at least another book.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  I am entertained by the world and characters created by Sylvia Day and I welcome the opportunity to live in that world for a short while - be it in a series of three books or five.  For me, the issue isn't the number of books, but how the author is handling the books themselves.  (Although like others, I saw the book marketed as a trilogy, so I was surprised by three books turning into five.)<br /><br />The problem is the book had no ending.  The book had alot of interesting story lines chugging along before it just ends abruptly without any resolution.  I have found this in several series as of late and as a reader, it puts me off completely.  I like reading a series, particularly when I like the characters, but each book must also be able to stand on its own for its story, its plot, for its entertainment value.  This book didn't.  It literally just ended with the characters going to bed and a note from the author to let us know it will be continued.  (Note to the author from me:  if you have to put a note at the end of the book to let the reader know it has been continued, then you haven't done your job.)<br /><br />Like others, I was disappointed.  It's a shame really, because I think the lack of an ending is detracting from the book and an enjoyable series.  It will also make me hesitate before I purchase the next one in the series.  The author has lost a bit of my trust as a reader.
0385344228|2.0|Each summer I indulge in a thriller or two for a little fun and entertainment. I think I'll need to be more careful about which books I pick because following the \\"buzz\\" doesn't seem to be working out. Last summer I read \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" and was disappointed by its lack of sophistication. I feel the same disappointment with \\"Defending Jacob.\\"<br /><br />The plot is simple: readers are supposed to wonder if Jacob is \\"the\\" killer of a classmate and also wonder if Jacob is, by nature, a violent sociopath hidden under a quiet, sometimes eerily-calm exterior. There is an annoying excess of contrivances and decoys to make readers both suspect and not suspect Jacob.<br /><br />There is little in the way of character development. By design Jacob is an enigma of sorts, which one might expect in a legal thriller like this. The lack of character development is more noticeable with Jacob's parents, Andy and Laurie. Andy is the narrator of the story. Andy and Laurie are characters driven by the simplistic plot. All you really get to know about them is that Andy has complete faith in Jacob's innocence and thinks of Jacob as a normal teenager, while Laurie has doubts and concerns. Oddly, Andy is a respected senior assistant district attorney in Boston who has no faith in the legal system. Even though he has complete faith in Jacob's innocence, he feels no qualms about interfering with evidence and ignoring red flags. In the first part of the book, the author goes to some lengths painting a picture of a close and happy marriage between Andy and Laurie, but later we see that Andy and Laurie are so locked into their simplistic character roles they can't have any discussion about Jacob, even in the presence of a counselor. I found Andy to be a very unlikable character, especially in the way he spoke with his wife about Jacob.<br /><br />I could list all the contrivances and decoys intended to keep readers guessing, but that would be a major spoiler. I'll just say that the sheer number of them seemed to be compensating for a lack of substance in this story. Is Jacob \\"the\\" killer? Is Jacob \\"a\\" killer? That's what this story asks readers to contemplate. But by the end of the story, with its potboiler ending, I didn't care. Even by the standards of light entertainment, this novel was too simplistic. Even though the author has real-life experience as an assistant DA, the legal maneuvers and courtroom proceedings have the circus quality and melodrama you find in the TV show Boston Legal but without any of the humor and wit. To further illustrate this point, the prosecuting assistant DA, Andy's protege Neal Logiudich (pronounced La-JOO-dis), was given a name that sounds just like \\"The Judas,\\" because that's exactly what he turned out to be.<br /><br />Better books: \\"Snow Falling On Cedars\\" is a legal thriller with character development; \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" is a chilling story of a sociopath child and his hapless parents; \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" is more of a spy thriller, but if you like thrillers and you haven't read it, it's one of the best. By comparison, \\"Defending Jacob\\" reads like a thriller written for young adults, like \\"Twilight\\" is a romance written for young adults.mber of them seemed to be compensating for a lack of substance in this story.

B002JN2KRW|5.0|I just received my Universal Waite Tarot Deck.  A wonderful deck.  I'm relatively new to Tarot but now have the Wild Wood, Druidcraft, Universal Tarot, Robin Wood and the standard Rider-Waite.  I think the UW is a really beautiful replacement for the standard R-W deck.  The Rider-Waite deck's colors were so harsh to me - the colors of the UW are much more calm, vibrant, and appealing to the eye.  A huge improvement in my opinion.  Really like the deck.  The deck has already selected me!

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Waited impatiently for the next phase of Gideon an Eva. The story did not disappoint. Gideon and Eva had a lot to work through such as Gideon killing Eva's childhood rapist and dealing with detectives trying to find the killer. Also, their exes getting into their lives and making it difficult for them to trust. The sex was amazing which I've come to expect from day readings and Gideon have the stamina of three to four twenty year olds. The ending was cheesy but you'll know there is more to come.<br /><br />Now to wait for the next installment of this story. It will go on auto like this one.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Epic series! Great acting. I really enjoyed this latest chapter, however I didn't particularly really like the season 3 ending.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Great looking, ergonomic mouse with extreme DPI (dots per inch) and beautiful lighting. It's so fast, in fact, that my mouse pad has too much friction to accurately use the mouse at times. It does toggle up and down, so you can fix it if your tracking surface isn't up to par. I'd say it's fantastic for gamers who need precision and speed, but not so much for the average user. Seriously, I cannot stress this enough, this thing is faster than the enterprise.

B00A7KKPDK|5.0|I debated getting this book because although I was in tears reading the first one because it was so funny, I didn't care for the second one as much.  I decided to get this one though and try it.  I'm very glad I did. It wasn't as funny as the first one, but it was very good. I really enjoyed reading it on the train.  I would definitely recommend it.

B007Z5LBE2|5.0|Again, this is one of those gems I watched for free using Amazon Prime. I will be buying a copy for my library. The actors really pulled you right into the story. The sets were breathtaking and later sad. This is everything you would want in good storytelling and visual decadence. Familiar with the actor's past roles, I was impressed with how they have grown and matured. You will not be disappointed. ~Bella Cosetta
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Shows how patriotic one American can become when faced with the dangers of todays war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Watched it several times
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The cast and the characters were well developed.  Loved the authentic Indian settings and hearing the Indian people. Good story with some depth, but still a lot of fun. Have recommended it to several friends.
B000JQUHLM|3.0|I really liked this book because of Pollyanna. She added a little bit of humor to things. And her persistent being glad made me smile. I like how the author morphed the classic into.a romance novel. She did a great job of showing the characters personality. I reccomend this book for people who like classics. This book is for both children and adults. :)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It was good, couldn't put it down. Read it in one sitting. The story is beautifully written. Romantic and a mystery
B0026P3G12|5.0|She loved it.  They play it in their car quite a bit.  The sound is clear and the voice lovely.  Susan has a gift from God.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|By far the best album from BTR so far!  I can't say enough good things about it.  Buy the Deluxe version to get 15 songs.  Definitely worth the extra $2.00.  The last 5 songs are really great.  Album has a more mature sound to it, but its still appropriate for all ages (unlike some other British boy bands...)  The lyrics are clean and have no hidden 'meanings', if you get what I mean.  Upbeat, positive songs that are fun to listen to.<br /><br />Definitely buy this album, even if you haven't been a BTR fan in the past.  Don't let the Nickelodeon stigma keep you away from hearing this album.  Its really truly great.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The story line was fascinating, the acting excellent, sets great, and special effects were phenomenal. Loved Richard Parker. Nothing bad, would recommend it to anyone.

B00CA4S27W|5.0|Ritchie Blackmore and his wife Candice Night (Blackmore's Night) dish out great contemporary folk music to my surprise in this new CD release titled 'Dancer & The Moon' (13 tracks). Guitar maestro Ritchie Blackmore shows off his guitar skills in instrumental tracks \\"Minstrels In The Hall\\", \\"Galliard\\" (wonderful orchestral base track, melody & also great violin playing) & \\"Carry On... Jon\\" (great bluesy guitar) as well as in the tracks \\"The Ashgrove\\" (great guitar finger pick-up) & \\"The Spinners's Tale\\".  Candice Night provides great vocals as in the tracks \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\" & \\"Temple Of The King\\".<br /><br />There are two eastern/indian music sound influenced tracks in \\"Lady In Black\\" & the title track \\"Dancer & The Moon\\" (both have a very 'rich' enticing sound).<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are \\"Galliard\\" (instrumental), \\"The Ashgrove\\", \\"The Spinner's Tale\\" & the closing track \\"Carry On... Jon\\" (insrumental).<br /><br />On overall, Blackmore's Night does not disappoint in this new CD 'Dancer & The Moon': great contemporary folk music and wonderful performance & production. A highly recommended CD listening.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|As a super fan of book 1 & 2, I have anxiously anticipated the release of the conclusion of Eva & Gideon's story. (For any of you Fifty fans, book 1 & 2 of Crossfire, put Fifty to shame.)  What I discovered with book three was a self indulgent attempt to linger and slowly churn out their story...this book lacked the intensity that the author so successfully brought to books 1 & 2. What a huge disappointment! I feel robbed! Good job SYLVIA, you have succeeded in pulling in more revenue...which feels like the entire purpose of book 3. Shame on you, I expected better. Book 3 wasn't anywhere near what it should, would, or could have been.
B0068THAGY|4.0|The small town atmosphere was nice and realistic, and the filming of the train crash was good too.  See it.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|The cord is small, and wirey you do need it, to charge the kindle, through the PC, but you need to buy an adapter for the cord separate to plug in wall, whcih makes the charging much faster.This I would say is a must.

B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have been waiting for so long for the next Quell game.  This one is the best one yet.  I love the hidden gems and extra levels.  I am trying to pace myself so that I don't finish the entire game too quickly.
1490313370|4.0|It is odd to pitch a book by saying \\"I've started 20 businesses, 17 failed.  Here are my secrets.\\"  It is also rare that an author examines their failures unflinchingly.  Altucher does both and surprisingly it is an uplifting book.  I can't find a trace of regret or bitterness in the failures.  Maybe Altucher hides it well or maybe he is honest and he is able to transcend failure.<br />I want to believe transcendence in possible.  Altucher doesn't mention it by name, but his philosophy is stoical: Don't worry about what you can not control, be social (be good to your fellow man), live in accordance with nature (live healthy).  The philosophy makes sense, but most lack the discipline. Altucher's philosophy is a remedy for our codependency. Choosing yourself requires accepting there is no one else who can help you, there are no short cuts.<br />It is refreshing for an author to refer to himself as mediocre.  I am so vain that I have a hard time believing Altucher really believes he is mediocre.  Acknowledging your own weakest is hard to do honestly.  Here is an example of how hard it is.  I can acknowledge that this is a crummy review, but I still think of myself as a good writer.  I give myself excuses as to why this isn't good - reviews are hard to write, I don't have time, there is no reason to write a good review.  But deep down, I know that I am not that good of a writer - probably just below average.  I know that is true, but I don't know if I fully believe it - is that deep down voice is real or false modesty.  Somehow Altucher makes being self critical work.

B009NY43NY|5.0|Since True Blood aired on HBO I began reading the books feverishly. They are so exciting and full of wonderful character and twists and turns.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|scanned an old black and white  photo booth picture beautifully .It was a picture to treasure for ever thank you!!! I really like that you can save and send scans as either a jpg or a pdf. If they add an easy OCR option for people to lift text to paste to documents I'll never need another scan app.
0316247545|4.0|I really liked this book.  I tells about all the main characters and gives a summary of each episode.  It does have DR Hooves listed with a picture but no information about him.  There is no mention of Derpy Hooves and she is left out of the summary of the episode in which she wrecks the town hall.  There is a picture of a pegasus pony sleeping on a cloud on page 35.  There is no name under the picture and the eyes are closed so we don't know if this is Derpy or not.  A really good book but they shouldn't have left Derpy out
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Minus the films being dark which I think is just the movie the later films seem very dark like some tv channels they were good movies/condition I like them all contained in one case not a bunch of seperate ones and it came in the mail in a timely manner
1609611543|5.0|What makes this book a must buy (IMHO) is it helped me really understand the digestive process better, and specifically how certain food groups are such powerful contributors to the creation of high blood sugar because they are absorbed so quickly.  I come from a diabetic family, so I am on alert to regain a very healthy body.<br /><br />While Dr. Davis concentrated on just eliminating GMO Wheat because is is such a big contributor to many health problems  (I have no doubt in this regard),  I made a major decision to eliminate 100% of all processed carbohydrates, and their derivative components used in so many other food products.  Also I eliminate all processed sugars and sweeteners.  I read labels carefully, if their are any trace of wheat, its components, sugar, I don't buy it.  That is a lot of food I won't touch ever again.<br /><br />I have now dropped 47 pounds in 90 days. and lost 6 inches around my middle, and the pain in my knees is much less.  My blood pressure before starting on this life change in eating was 168 over 95.  After 30 days it was 124 over 80.  That's a 40 point drop.  Amazing. Yeah, I was way overweight. I take zero prescription meds.  I am only 18 pounds from my final goal of 190.  I was 255.  I am 79 year old, and feel great.<br /><br />All I have done is totally  eliminate (100%) all wheat and other common gluten producing grains, and all the products it gets put into... also other high starch items like white rice and potatoes.  I cleaned out my shelves of all the high carbohydrate processed products ... macaroni, spaghetti, plus everything with high fructose corn syrup and sugars ... ketchup, sauces, gravies, all breads, crackers, bagels, sandwiches ... so I am down to very low wheat and grain carbohydrate intake.  I feel great ... I have no craving for bread, pasta in any form. There is zero nutrition in sugars and sweeteners.  I also eliminated all dairy.  I have found Chia, flax, quinoa, sesame seeds, and a variety of nuts, and lotsof avocado's. Live foods (fruits, green leafy vegetables, etc)... some fish and organic chicken, maybe a filet once in a while.  less meat more vegetable, nuts, high omega 3 products like Krill Oil... protein powder from yellow peas,and hemp seeds.  Smoothies are a wonderful way to provide excellent nutritional combination using almond or coconut milk and papaya or cherry juices, berries, and bananas.<br /><br />I don't consider this a diet ... it is a new way for me, of eating to obtain a much more healthy body.  I am exhilarated and freed from all the bad hype on low fat, counting calories, cholesterol bally-hoo, etc.<br /><br />This book by Dr. Davis is a god-send and a wake-up call to everyone.  Get the real story about how our bodies operate.<br /><br />Read and understand the real message of this fabulous book.  We have been grossly mislead by today's nutritionists, medical community and news media. They all hype the marketing methods of the food industry that is making millions of dollars at the expense of the health and well-being of all of us. Read this book, change your misleading ideas of so-called healthy eating of processed and packaged foods (focusing on low fats and cholesterol) ... Yes, I realize that as individuals we react differently to various foods, etc.  Watch how your body reacts.  It never lies.<br /><br />Eat real food loaded with all the essentials ... fresh, not processed.  Natural, not enhanced. Lots of herbs and spices.  I turned to Plant based eating ... Berries, nuts, fruits (not high is sweetness) ... some fish and some chicken ... not much red meat ... no dairy, no soy,  Sound tough to do ... not when my health is at stake.  My vitals are excellent ... all well within optimal ranges.<br /><br /> Yes, I am really sold on the tenants that Dr. Davis offers.  They are sound, and I am an example of how quickly the turn around of stubborn weight loss can be.  It works, I no longer crave anything with food industry processed contents. Since I don't crave, I don't stuff myself anymore.  Buy the book, it will improve the quality of your life if you will follow the guidelines presented.  Variety is also important.  Drink lots of water ... lemon or Apple cider vinegar is also helpful  (needed to help detox the gut).<br /><br />I am continuing to learn and investigate other complementary health contributions by other medical scientists ... i.e. Dr. Alejandro Junger re: \\"Clean Gut\\"  and his detox program.  Read more on Leaky Gut syndrome, etc.  Insightful and important.<br /><br />I am learning that flax and almond flour can be used for many bread like items.  But, no wheat, barley, rye, ever again.  Corn is also GMO.  I don't do potatoes, but brown rice is fine for me.  FWIW
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I loved Season 1, but Season 2 pushed more boundaries.  I love that it still maintained it's wonderful quality while still getting edgier.  Waiting impatiently for Season 3!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I am not usually a James Bond film fan, but I rented this video on Instant Video and was pleasantly surprised and how good of film it was. Right combination of action and drama, along with the usual Bond villain.
3551354014|5.0|Came in wonderful condition, on time, and is exactly what I wanted. The story is wonderful, and I recommend it to anyone. If you're learning German, I wouldn't recommend it until you're almost done with a German 2 class. German 3 would be desired, I think.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The story does not continue in an interesting and surprise filled manner, as I expected. Instead of concluding the adventures of the already long list of characters, he has added many more with very few binding explainations as to were they are going in the story.<br /><br />I am still reading the book but, If the ending is devoid of a cliffhanger, it would not entice me to buy volume 6.
B004132HZS|5.0|If it weren't for NetFlix, I never would have found this gem! It popped up as a recommendation and I'm SO glad I took the time to watch it.  I'm not keen on the recent Sherlock Holmes movies (RDJ is just so arrogant, and it bleeds into all his characters, something I find takes me out of the watching experience), but this portrayal was far more deep and genuine.  Yes, Holmes is a self-absorbed character, but in Cumberbatch's portrayal, it worked, and not because the actor is a pig (like RDJ).  I found that it likely required far more acting prowess than RDJ (or Johnny Miller on &#34;Elementary&#34;) ever bring to the character.<br /><br />There is no better, more loyal, more hilarious, or more soulful Watson than Freeman's.  He's not a sidekick in this version.  I'm so grateful to the creators and writers that Watson is not a stooge or a babysitter.  He's an active member of the team and an excellent foil to Sherlock.<br /><br />The writing is superb; it's not as dark as American crime procedural shows are (a fine relief for this Yank who's more than a little sick of all the gratuitous bloodbaths on TV these days), and instead has to be carried by thoughtful writing and believable acting - &#34;Sherlock&#34; has both.  It's also got some wonderfully comedic one-liners, which lighten the dark scenes without cheapening them.<br /><br />A note to those who haven't watched the series, especially American friends who aren't familiar with this style - this is not like regular US TV series where a season will have 21-26 episodes, 42 minutes a piece.  This is similar to BBC's &#34;Wallander&#34; (another immensely good show!) in that it's a series of 3, 90-minute movies, essentially.  It's easy to get greedy and want far more than 3 episodes per season!

B001BKVWYG|5.0|I think this is the album sold on the sly in South Africa during apartheid.  Listen and you will know why.  Suppression takes many ugly guises and Rodriguez captures the subtle cruelties of life in so many ways in his songs.  Sing Rodriguez, sing and tell it like it is....  Tell the capitalist  pigs and the elitists bigots that we won't take it anymore.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|They have taken over my tablet & PC playing this addictive game. I like it took so I bought another tablet so we can all play!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of the best games of all time, actually it is the best. But, the Apple products do have faster updates and the kindle needs to step it up with updates.
B004N6369Y|5.0|This was a good book and reminded me and everyone who reads it the value of a single parent.  Very well written
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Great performer.  Poet in the best since of the word.  Take in the movie about him and you will fall in love with him.  Just a great guy from the streets of Detroit.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|One really has to watch this movie closely. It jumps all over a period of history spanning  500 plus years. The actors play mulitple characters, in different vignettes...and sometimes in the same vignette, I think. So, to keep up with the movie, one must pay attention. It does a good job of tying it all together in the end. In essence it isn't more than a morality play, good vs. evil, but done in a creative way with really good acting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hey I'm Leah j Gulota and I love this game seriously get'm it. It is easy to earn coins and I'm not bragging but I earned 1000 coins and somethin' in the game (no kiddin)
B0085A9HXS|5.0|There are probably 10 lines in this movie. The rest is fighting. This makes one great action movie that sets the bar. Guns, blades, and martial arts (Indonesion Silat) not much more to say. If you love action or claim to own a MAN-card then you must watch this.
B009VLX8FS|2.0|The previous album was much better. Most songs sound about the same and they get old after about two listenings. I love maybe one or two songs from the entire album.
0553093029|5.0|Lots of gorgeous illustrations make this book a must-have. Wish there was even more in it.The price was definitely right!
B00BC24NT4|3.0|I enjoyed this novel, but it was merely okay.  The characters and plot are thin, and the ideology overpowers the fiction.  I knew immediately where Le Carre (and his main character) was headed; the novel holds no surprises.  The class issues - the main character is from a lower middle class background - are mildly interesting, but the message, that British intelligence has sold out to international corporations and their mercenaries, is the real and only message that this novel seeks to deliver.<br /><br />That said, a mediocre Le Carre novel is still a pretty good read.  Verdict: &#34;Beach book.&#34;  And it's summer!
B0079J28NC|3.0|I guess if you like the Beatles it is ok. I don't care for them so can't really say if it's good or not.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|4-1 star people are wrong because it is a great game for all ages. It should be worth $3.00. It is a good game
B004UID2LC|5.0|WARNING THIS APP IS AMAZING! it searches just like on a computer. it gives u the option 2 download the video if u like it(4the kindle fire) and it places it in ur gallery.

B004PZ4HC8|4.0|Max Brooks in World War Z write about the zombie apocalypse from the standpoint of him being hired by the U.N. to record the stories of survivors all throughout the world. This book was written after his other famous book \\"Zombie Survival guide\\". World War Z dosen't reference the book but does use the same zombie mentioned in it as the protagonist for this apocalypse. The book is split into 5 different sections depicting where the stories are taking place throughout the war. It ranges from a nerd who was completely outcasted from Tokyo society barely able to escape his apartment complex to a entrapeaneaur that made a fortune selling a fake zombie vaccine, killing millions making billions. Brooks uses a unique form of Q&A that acts like an interview, unfortunately this disrupts the flow of the story being given and can make you yearn for when he stops talking and the person who is being interviewed begins. Some character in this book are mundane and when they tell their story of the zombie apocalypse you are disinterested and bored. But in the end this book was a great read. It tries to adaqueately interpret how the human world would react in a zombie apocalypse. Also it creates a more realistic version of a zombie that could be seen as more possible (even if zombies are entirely impossible). This book is almost completely different from the movie that shares the same name. And you will enjoy the ok much more if you read Brooks previous zombie book, giving backsight on how to survive and what to expect in a zombie apocalypse. In the end this book is for peopel that like realistic fiction and want to immerse themselves in a world where zombies do exist and have ravished the place.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app because it is minecraft and I love minecraft it is fun it is great for all ages get this app
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it - never expected the ending! The story details were so intriguing and well thought out - can't wait for the next book!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a simple game. My kids love it my seven year old beats at it all the time. My four year old loves it as well. Keeps them busy
B0015AARJI|1.0|I did not receive the product though I contacted the sellers many times and I was not successful to get my purchase. It is billed in my credit card statement and I had to pay for it. Additionally, it is very complex to dispute the purchase through the site. Very disappointing. I felt betrayed by the seller.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|Boards of Canada have always brought a sense of dream like nostalgia with every album they've released, each album being more of a journey into a 'past that never existed', as well as a great listening experience. With Music Has the Right to Children, it seemed to be through such things as public information films, educational documentaries, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and obscure Video Nasties, evoking a sense of longing for that era with child like dream-scapes. Geogaddi was like a dark, demonic, claustrophobic nightmare, those dreams replaced by nightmares and dread that was more `tales of the unexpected' than `tomorrow's world', invoking a darker side to the nostalgia, using mathematics and numerology and reverse speech (A is to B as B is to C, Gyroscope, The Devil Is In the Details). Then came out The Campfire Headphase, (their most accessible offering), which was like an Eno-esque calm down after the storm, the Boards channelling their nostalgic sounds through wobbling folk like music and organic guitars, with soaring epic melodies like `Dayvan Cowboy'. Unfortunately, for BoC, it was a little too 'straight forward', but still a 'pleasant' listen.<br /><br />With `Tomorrow's Harvest', most of the nostalgia seems to be that of despair and nihilism. It's an album that builds in a new way upon their previous work and casts it in a 'those golden days are over' kind of light that correlates with the direction the world in general seems to be heading. The sounds of a broken world, paranoia of the future, the cold war (echoing the Protect and Survive [DVD] videos that they flirted with on Geogaddi), and the sounds of a planet 'wasting away'. Opener Gemini gives us an immediate false sense of security with a trombone like sound (a bit like something from a 'Protect and Survive' warning video that was broadcast on British TV in the early 80s) before going into full on retro '70s/80s film soundtrack post apocalyptic' mode. `Split your Infinities' contains Dalek like sounds over crunching beats and dark synths. Palace Posy is like a thunderous, Aphex Twin sound alike mantra, and a weird alien type distorted voice towards the end. These vocals seem to appear on a large abundance of the tracks midway through (much like Geogaddi), and the 'subliminal' sounds and messages are perhaps more present than ever, the beats and percussion more diverse and aspiring (the Boards have really triumphed other releases in this department) with ticks, beats and drums that almost leap out in 3-dimensional from all directions, giving a sonic sound-scape of doom and fear. This is certainly an album that rewards multiple listens to 'crack the code' to get your own personal narrative, as well as to admire the ground breaking genius of it's production.<br /><br />It's an uncompromising yet more than satisfactory effort from the Boards than The Campfire Headphase, and a progression that is exactly what us BoC fans expect (i.e.- it's a grower, and gets better with each and every single listen, has a new theme, e.t.c). If you're looking for catchy tunes that reach through dreams-capes that bring back the fondest memories of youthful innocence it's pretty scarce, but it's still there, lurking beneath the wasted ruins (Cold Earth is classic melodic BoC). This is the sound of (in my interpretation) wanting to leave a chaotic and corrupted planet that our future is headed towards, and to discover new dimensions in space in the search of hope. But I'm sure other BoC fans will have their own, which is the brilliance of their music. Single `Reach for the Dead' fits in well within the context, and a precursor of the spacey, uncertain darkness that is to come, whilst still maintaining that signature sound of 'icy cold warmth'.<br /><br />Artwork is always important with any Boards of Canada album. Rockets, the earth's destruction, and other planets (or perhaps even relating to Warfare) are all in the cards. There's even a picture of a boot stepping on what looks likethe moon. And as for earth? You only need to take a look at the album cover and a few other pictures of Threads [DVD] [1984] like dystopian cities and landscapes. And as usual, the artwork compliments the sounds perfectly (not to mention the track titles).<br /><br />BoC sound more 'alien', yet concise, than ever. Even on the beautiful, multi layered melodic classic 'New Seeds', you can hear a warbled sample from 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' at the end. This is essentially BoC's 'exploration of youth, space, and 21st century dystopia', which might explain why the nostalgia sounds bleaker, more hopeless and paranoid. A few tracks contain a 10-0 countdown to 'pushing the button' of a nuclear missile, with firey sounds in the background. So yeah, pretty different from 'The Campfire Headphase'.<br /><br />It ends with the 'Corsair' like 'Semena Mertvykh', a final short, dark ambient piece that sounds like a planet lacking hope, a finale of planet earth 'soaring through space' out of sheer sadness and desperation. It's the sound of the end of times.<br /><br />Tomorrows Harvest (named after 'an online clothing and supplies store that seems to cater for crisis scenarios - frozen and sealed food supplies, gas masks, and solar power') is a very strong, yet unremittingly bleak (their bleakest yet), return from The Boards, those childhood dreams of the past now shattered by a dark and uncertain future, a journey through sonic firey landscapes, channelled through the murky era of 70s and 80s dystopian film synth scores (of the Video Nasties variety), combining the classic sounds of their back catalogue with exciting new twists. And they do a damn fine job taking you to this strange, dissonant yet terrifying place, that will have you pressing the replay button time and time again until countdown to 0.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The acting was top notch and best dramatic film of the year! I cried and laughed. I would watch again and again.
034580404X|5.0|Thank You, Love the books, on the last book! Wish I had read them sooner, looking forward to the movie!!!
B000HZGNEU|2.0|At this point in the Star Trek movie series, the characters have become caricatures. This movie was landlocked on earth with the corniest dialogue and silly situations making jabs at the 70's/80's. Leonard Nimoy directed. He almost directed the series in into oblivion. It's hard for me not to like Star Trek, but this one did not do it for me.
1451695195|5.0|I loved that Eben examined his entire experience scientifically.  If you have a loss or no someone who is terminal this book is a must read!!  It will provide hope and peace despite the difficulty!
B001X15F3C|5.0|I understand that most people either hate or love this movie--similar to Batman, Batman Forever, and Batman and Robin. The only movie I will stand to compare this with is the Batman where Jack Nicholson reigns as the Joker, and the most recent let out movie, the Dark Knight Rises. I won't compare Anne Hathaway to Michelle (both Catwomen) because I actually like both, but (I do like this catwoman because her voice is so much yummier)...<br />This movie has Christopher Walken in it, and that was initially the only reason I bothered seeing this film, aside from the fact that it well, has Batman in it, and the same man that plays Batman is also Beetle juice; I had to take the lookie loo, just knowing this bit of trivia.<br />It doesn't disappoint; I think the Penguin was portrayed a little more monstrous that he could have been where as he's seen completely different in the animated versions on television. That doesn't mean I'm not satisfied with the character. He's just as dark and gruesome. Actor displays him beautifully in all the evilness he holds, and the plot he has towards the end of the movie is diabolical all by itself! Even Christopher Walken who plays Max Shreck is disgusted by it (and that's saying something!).<br />What I love most about this movie is the chemistry that Catwoman and Batman have together. Sure we've seen the comics, the video games, and all the other media that portrays it but Michael and Michelle just HAVE it! :D
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like how quickly thing regenerate, but not all prices are listed for upgrades or building pitches. You cannot pitches everything from sub menus, which is also frustrating.
B000HZHBIM|4.0|This is the first of the Star Trek movies and though it had it's flaws, I enjoyed it. It was more like a long ponderous episode of the Star Trek series rather than a full-fledged movie.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Not great literature by any stretch but a fun read with some insights - I felt that it was a good into to applying LEAN to software development.
B000053VAF|5.0|This movie is something that the most religious will debate being 'good', and probably any Christian would not like unless they are open-minded....like me. I loved this film because Jason Lee, Alan Rickman and Chris Rock are just fantastic. The writing is hilarious, and the actors and actresses bring it to life. This movie has a few Bible-altering theories about whether or not God is a woman or a man, whether or not Jesus was the only child of Mary (because face it, Mary and Joseph were together for years!). Jason Lee portrays a demon who helps Bartleby and Loki try in get back to heaven when they were banished to Wisconsin. A demon who cares not whether Earth turns upside down just so as long he doesn't have to go back to Hell. This movie gets pretty epic and dynamic towards the middle, but it's already hilarious when you first start watching it. Just to have a few laughs and become more open-minded this movie is like a parody of the Da Vinci Code...not exactly but it has the same principle: It makes people think.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game so much more than the first and it's so much better now with the updates. I love it and would recommend this game to any one.
B000I3UMLQ|2.0|Hmmm... this bordered on sacrilegious. I hated this movie at the theatre when it came out. My opinion hasn't changed much.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Engrossing reading about life in the camps. Was hoping for a stronger ending even though I know that this is really a living biography.
B000JCSBU0|2.0|This film is unfortunately very raw and very real for many people. As a former druggie I know from the inside what these feelings are. No hope no happiness. no purpose. Then I allowed God to take control of my life and found not only salvation through Jesus but also a sureness of hope, a happiness that runs deeper than and down day. It is my baseline. Most importantly I found purpose for living. The purpose we were created for. I had to bottom out before I was able to open up. Cause when you realize you don't have anything to offer, you realize you don't have anything to lose. The irony lies in the fact that I was made a winner by realizing I was a loser. This film offers no hope. That's it downfall.<br />\\" Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\\" Jesus in Matthew 11:28-30.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of my favorite British series.  The period details are well done, and the development of characters is carried out with great care.
B000HZGNDG|5.0|This Star Trek was one of my favorites with the old crew. They finally caught on that we want a concrete nemesis: Christopher Plummer was excellent as a Klingon Baddie. The more interesting political intrigue made this movie soar above the others. But these guys can't go on saving the universe forever. Its high time for the Next Generation.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|This app was  so slow! I couldn't search quickly or anything like that. It wouldn't even let me log into my YouTube account. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. It was a huge disappointment.
B00C2U6EUG|5.0|First things first. THIS IS IN NO WAY THE JOHN WILLIAMS THEME. Don't get me wrong, I love the 1978 soundtrack, but this is a soundtrack for a re-imagined Superman. The Williams soundtrack was his interpretation of the Superman of the 1970s. Zimmer does a wonderful job of writing an exciting, energetic, and emotional soundtrack for the Superman of today. All of the tracks are very well done, but \\"DNA,\\" \\"Oil Rig,\\" \\"Flight,\\" \\"Goodbye My Son,\\" and \\"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\\" stand out the most to me. This soundtrack also incorporates an unusual orchestra instrumentation with the inclusion of guitars, synth, and (if I remember correctly) 15 drummers. Some people may complain about the repetition of melodies, but that's to be expected. If we're to judge soundtracks based on repetition, we should be complaining about John Williams including \\"Duel of the Fates\\" in the three Star Wars prequels with slight variation AND technically including it twice on the Episode III soundtrack. It happens in movie soundtracks all the time, so if somebody says \\"oh, they all sound the same,\\" disregard their opinion. This soundtrack is definitely worth the purchase and worth many listens.
1422188612|5.0|The updated version of the First 90 Days makes an already good book even better. Some of the material has been moved around to provide a more logical sequence (e.g. the boss conversations  are now sensibly put before starting to identify quick wins). Some headings now express more clearly what follows, e.g. \\"Prepare Yourself\\" instead of \\"Promote Yourself\\"). A few helpful visual displays have also been added. This book remains an excellent toolbox for any manager entering a new job. Following the book as a roadmap not only will ensure a successful transition but also an acceleration of performance. The book can be used on its own, but even more powerfully in combination with onboarding coaching. As an executive coach, I have been using the First 90 Days as a helpful guideline to coach leaders successfully through career transitions. I look forward to doing the same with the updated version.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have a lot of fun with this game. It's addicting and well made. Easy to play but you want to keep beating your best scores.
B00CWV8X04|2.0|It was supposed to be a thriller that started way too slow.  I found the &#34;side effects&#34; boring.<br />I began to wonder why I rented the movie when I realized the movie was about exactly its<br />title - so I thought.  I thought it too long to hook you into the portion of the movie that made<br />it a thriller.  Glad I rented and did not purchase it.
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|It's a great story to begin with and told with painful honesty. But also with great skill. The result is a thrilling narrative, thought-provoking, evocative and exceptionally well written.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|This movie is so interesting. The product came in great condition. I'm really glad that I purchased it when I did.
B00992CF6W|5.0|really good game .the new update came too. if you liked this on Pc or xbox you will love this.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was simply AMAZING!! I was so engrossed in reading that it was so hard to put down! The twists and turns keeps one on the very edge of their seat! Way to go Sylvia Day....I am totally looking forward to the third book!<br /><br />\\"Do not consider this series anything like the Fifty Shades of Grey series....this series is a whole different story line of a whole different view of honest true love!!\\"
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|10 yr olds favorite game.  Build your own kingdom, fight battles, and have fun. Mom also enjoys this game. Good game to try.<br /><br />I do not like that they try to force  you to connect with other.  I also do not like the plethora of in game buying options.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This movie is a great buy! It came in great condition, secured and whatnot. Glad that I bought it when I did.
0765367351|5.0|This is a novelization of the events leading up to the events depicted in Bioshock.  It is very useful for its biographical information of the characters of the novel, which those who play the game only get a sample of from diaries found throughout the game.Bioshock has two sequels, which this novel will provide a good introduction to the world of Rapture.
B000000WHC|5.0|Gary Moore was one of the greatest irish blues musican, and this cd was his masterpeice before taking his bow. So many good memories to these soulfull, electric blues and soothing voice.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|What a wonderful Western.  My wife and I started watching it and couldn't stop until we watched all 5 episodes.  Acting by Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones were outstanding and very convincing.  Dianne Lane was fabulous even Angelica Huston was wonderful.  The views across Texas as well as Montana were great picks to see.  My only disappointment with the Blu Ray was that in all of the dark, night scenes, it was very grainy.  You could still see the video but it was very grainy for a Blu Ray.  Apparently they must have recorded it from a low level copy.  But the rest of the video was fine.  I highly recommend it.  If you haven't seen this series, you are missing some very fine Western stories that I will put as high up as Silverado, and Tombstone.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Can't wait for the next one to come out! I will definitely be purchasing that one! This movie is so interesting. The product came in great condition. I'm really glad that I purchased it when I did.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|This show is flawless, I was blown away by the supreme acting of the cast, it has also given me a new appreciation for the gladiators of the past.
0143038583|5.0|This  book was suggested for me by a relative who is a nutritionist.  I wasn't sure why she thought I should read it, until I did!  Wow!  It is such a thoughtful &#34;story&#34; of where our food comes from and why we choose to eat as we do.  Anyone who eats should read this book!
B009GI8J1O|3.0|Let me begin by saying I believe the author is a fine writer and is technically solid. He seems to have a firm grasp of character construction and can create engaging dialogue. He even occasionally coins a very steal-able turn of phrase. I think he might one day produce a very good novel. But Cloud Atlas was not it for me. The sheer tedium threatened to overwhelm me daily. From the entire novel I found exactly one truly interesting and sympathetic character. The rest were two-dimensional cardboard people with very little, if anything, to say. Ironically, the one seemingly real character is the one that is supposed to be fake.<br />The author spent considerable energy on a common thread of pro-equality and anti-discrimination, and visibly noodled with various philosophical turnings on this theme at several angles, but still remains unconvincing even on this well worn territory. To be quite honest the only reason I made it through was grim determination to see what so many people were gushing over. About halfway I began hoping the end would bring sense to it all. Alas, the book never really ends. It just stops. I'm sure many people genuinely like this book. Perhaps others give it great reviews from a momentary joy of accomplishment to have got through the interminable thing. However, I am relieved to be done and wouldn't recommend the experience to anyone. Unless you want to be bored stiff. There are much more entertaining arguments on man's treatment of man to be had from Jack London books and they take a lot less time to read.
1400044162|5.0|Half of a Yellow Sun is a beautiful, compelling piece of work that tells the story of Nigeria's civil war through the eyes of a few unique and memorable characters. The story is as much about these characters' relationships as it is about the war itself, yet it offers an intensely personal glimpse at how war affects civilians: the terror of air raids, the pangs of starvation, the humility of displacement, and the fear of conscription. Although the Biafran War took place decades ago, these realities are painfully true in many counties around the world today. Half of a Yellow Sun is an enjoyable read with a bigger meaning, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in African literature.
B005L193RO|5.0|I loved the book, very well organized, very easy to read, and very useful advices for everyone! I'm an entrepreneur, and I found it especially useful, but I'm sure a teacher or student would also benefit greatly from it.
0061673730|5.0|I first read this book in the 70's.  Loved it then and love re-reading it now.  You don't have to be a motorcycle enthusiast to appreciate the lessons.
B0000549B0|5.0|I love this movie and the copy quality is just fine.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'd heard many great things about this book and with the movie coming out soon I decided to read it now.  It is better than anything I ever heard or read about it.  The psychology and emotional make up of the characters is extreme at times, but completely believable.  It is both a tragic and heroic tale of evil and redemption and the toll both take on ones soul.
B002TXZRNQ|5.0|A very good place fo find, again, basic and common sense ideas about what really matters in life.  Will read it again, for sure.
B00338QENI|5.0|SKLOOT is admirably remarkable in the depths of her research.She goes to great lengths to be fair. The reader pitied the descendents of Henrietta and feels they should be recognized and compensated--mainly because they are so pitifully needy. Yet at the same time, SKLOOT let's us recognize the absurdity of compensating people for any bit of tissue scraped from their bodies. Who wants it? Yuk, I don't even want to see it! Welcome to it!  Until money comes into it. And there's the conundrum. SKLOOT indicates that laws will need to be made.I would not want to have to make them. This remarkable book opened our eyes to all sides of this issue.
B001E75QH0|5.0|All were shipped in good condition and shipping was just as estimated. I would recommend this series. We have had a lot of fun watching all of them.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I just finished Dead Ever After, to the loss of the work I was supposed to be doing.  Ms. Harris did a beautiful job of tying up loose ends.  I think people just like Eric WAY too much, and it clouds their vision, thus the smarmy reviews.  So if you are a true Sookie fan, go ahead and get it.  We all need closure.  It is a sweet ending, takes care of all the unanswered questions, and while there are definitely departures from her style of writing, I just don't know how it could all be conveyed without the third person.<br /><br />On a more personal note, I want to thank Ms. Harris for the many many hours of good reading she has given me.  I have enjoyed all of her series, but Sookie is the best. I've read it four times.  It has helped me survive getting 2/3's of a Master's degree, and I will probably have to start the whole thing over at some point to get through the final third.

You can learn a lot of things here to use on your life or business.

This should be for ages 5&amp;+ only because there is a little violence in this game. If ur child can handle violence then this game would be ok for them. This game is really fun and i love it.

B000FA5STS|4.0|I love David Baldacci's books - this one great, too. Well spent time. I will continue reading his books in the future.

B008KP6ENE|5.0|Reminds me of mario. Fun platformer with really nice gaphics.  Controls respond well, but would have been nice to see the controls on interface.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Not sure how realistic it is for a guy to walk in off the street and get away with being a lawyer, but it's fun to watch!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This game keeps your mind and your reflexes quick. It is more fun as you build up points and you get more pearls.
0307352153|2.0|As an introvert, I was excited to come across this book. While I really, really wanted to like Quiet, I didn't. Although this book offers some new insights on the topic of introverts and extroverts, too much of the info was repackaged from other books I've read (the author openly acknowledges her heavy reliance on outside sources/groups who did the real research).<br /><br />The most insightful part of the book was her take-down of the Harvard MBA program and the horrible consequences our country has endured as the result of embracing this management style. While hilarious and frightening at the same time, it's worth remembering that our author is a Harvard Law grad; I got the sense there was a good dose of Ivy drama being played out here.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out who this book was written for (I would consider this to be more of a business psychology book). Similarly, I couldn't figure out why the author wrote this book in the first place. She reveals very little about herself beyond her fear of speaking in public (not a problem all introverts face) and anxiety so severe that is causes her to throw up (again, not a prerequisite for introversion). Yet somehow she managed to navigate her way through adolescence with barely a scratch and come out with a fantastic education from one of the most competitive schools in the country; really? That's the story I'm interested in reading.<br /><br />Whatever her intentions, I think this books primary purpose is to serve the author professionally; it's a great line on her CV. If you are an introvert and would like to learn more about yourself, I highly recommend The Introvert Advantage.
B008602KQI|4.0|Enjoyed the different twists and turns of the plots during the entire movie.  Very good acting and directing throughout.  Duration was long but went by quickly.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My boys age 12 and 14 love this game. I am glad they both have because when they didn't they were always saying  &#34;Hey, it's my turn now &#34;. Well worth it !
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Awesome fun for all ages. We absolutely love the way the game is and how it works. I would definitely recommend this to others.
1781162646|1.0|I like very-very much Hard Case Crime books and think that some of the King's novels are rather interesting. But unfortunately this novel isn't belong to this series - too little suspense or even the absolute lack of it; 'Joyland' isn't hard-boiled AT ALL and even isn't stylish; 'Ghost' plot-line is unnecessary and didn't add anything at all to the characters or even the plot; mystery is solved at the last pages with the use of such unfair device (hack writers love to use it) as deus ex machina.<br /><br />So it's very bad thriller, and even worse mystery.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I did the tutorial, then couldn't go any farther since I didn't know anyone who also has the same app on their Kindle Fire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I got this game for my 7 &amp; 6 yr old and I enjoy playing it just as much if not more and they LOVE it, so please give it a try. I don't think you'd be disappointed at all. There are a lot of cool things about this game one thing I like is how I get to decorate my own village and there are a lot of cool things you can buy ( with coins or acorns , of course just like many other games coming out today or are out you can actually buy (with real money BUT hey they do run deals a bunch, so whether you just want to play without putting any money into it or buying coins or acorns every once in a while I'm almost certain you too will LOVE this game just as much as my family and I have ( I've even got their dad into playing it, it really is fun for EVERYONE!! If you do play, I hope you and your family enjoy it as much as we have!<br /><br />-M-
B00004D301|2.0|When I order DVD's I'm always careful to order the correct region, when I ordered no region was specified so I assumed it was region 1, however when this arrived it wouldn't play on my player. I did however get my refund quickly and promptly.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|Most of the movie was dark; and finally at the end I just thought the story line was stupid.  I would not recommend you pay 3.99 for this movie.  My husband and I were looking for a little scary but this was not scary just ridiculous.  Don't get me wrong, I love Ethan Hawke.  He is why we rented the movie. Just disappointed based on my expectations.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like this All-in-one Mahjong because it automatically lets you know how many more matches you have before you have to scramble.  Also dings when you need to scramble so you can be a winner.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Extremely well written. It kept me guessing until the very end. Just when you think you have the plot figured out she throws you for a loop. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes intelligently written works.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Are you kidding me? I waited six months for Eva and Gideon to have more sex and that's it..... what a big let down.  I think I will be coming different authors.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This has become a classic for us.  We almost have it memorized and our originall VHS copy is fading fast.  We would prefer they not have used some of the language but concede that it was probably appropriate to the time frame.  Never realized George Clooney had such a gift for comedy - but this was his best so far!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|You don't have to see the first movie to enjoy this one.  It's better than the first. The sets are not nearly as gloomy, either.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|WOW. Just a mind blowing movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, the whole movie through. It's the best drama thriller movie I have seen in a long time. Plus Milia Kunis and Natalie Portman, kiss in it. It's actually a lesbian sex scene between the two actresses. It's a HOT scene between two of hollywoods hottest actresses to date.
B00136JT3Y|5.0|It's great that Amazon lets us &#34;sample&#34; music.  I don't know a lot about Pink, but I'm finding out all about her music thanks to Amazon!  I really liked this album too!
B0002O37RM|5.0|Charlie Haden is a jazz bass player who I feel I have not devoted enough time to learning his music. Every time I hear something from this very diverse and very talented player I always enjoy it. His 2005 collaboration with Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Land of the Sun, is one of his albums that I happily stumbled upon by accident and continuously come back to time and time again. This is a beautiful romantic jazz masterpiece with Charlie Haden on bass, Gonzalo Rubalcaba on piano, Ignacio Berroa on drums/percussion and a variety of other great musicians. All of the songs except two were originally written by the Mexican composer Jose Sabre Marroquin while the other two were written by two other Mexican composers: Armando Manzanero and Augustine Lara. This album is just absolutely stunningly beautiful and it well deserves the grammy it won Haden in 2005 for best Latin Jazz album. This was Haden's and Rubalcaba's second collaboration on a latin jazz album and their second grammy together after winning one for their previous collaboration Nocturne. Rubalcaba is an absolute amazing Cuban pianist who did a wonderful job of arranging the delicate music for this album. It's probably my favorite album to put on to either enjoy a nice relaxing morning watching the sun rise or at the end of the day when I just want to sit down, relax, look back at my day and smile. The music is simple and relaxing while also being eloquent and uplifting. The fifth track on the album, Nostalgia, always puts a smile on my face and is a great way to enjoy a beautiful sunset.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|This movie is really exciting with some unexpected twists.  The acting is great and the production is exceptional.  See it.
B009AP2G26|5.0|i love this show. I enjoy the music selection as well as the storyline. Great entertainment!! Keeps me laughing and wanting to download music.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I got this book because I'm one of those peoples that always think of the perfect thing to say, about an hour later than when I could have used it.  So far, this book is helping me get those ideas front and center so I can say what I know right up front.
B005F9TQ4C|5.0|This is perhaps one of Bob Dylan's best albums , no matter what the experts say. The music, the lyrics, the vocals are all awesome.<br /><br />A must have in any music lover's collection !
B004M5HUXE|4.0|Interesting look at the way things were. Lawrence is a bit repetitive (repeats the same sentence over and over within a paragraph or within several paragraphs) but all in all I enjoyed it. Steamy? Yes. But what probably got it banned was the liberal use of the f-word amongst others.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading the book. Wish she had written more books.  I was became involved wtih their struggles and hardships and sorry the book had to end....Loved It.
B001JDGK2E|5.0|The Fun House concert tour was televised, and ever since I saw that I just had to have Pink's album in my Amazon cloud.  If you already know this album for it's hits, I highly recommend the entire album, it's all good!
B0088XXCZ6|2.0|I was never super into Fiona Apple but i've always LOVED LOVED LOVED her big hit, &#34;criminal&#34;.  I was hoping that this album would be similar to that song but it's not.  There's not a lot of feeling in any of these songs, it's almost monotone.  I've given it a couple listens, and I'll give it a couple more and see if my opinion changes after hearing it a few more times.<br /><br />I'm probably not the best judge of this seeing as how I never owned a Fiona Apple album before, and i've only been in love with one of her songs ever, but this album was very lackluster for me.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like  a beautiful albeit searching dream. Such sadness yet such healing. Thank you for this book.<br />It makes me consider my own family.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was very realistic in special effects, the truth of human suffering, human desire to help, not give up and victory. The actors really captured the spirit of the movie.
B004132HZS|5.0|My family and I love this updated version of the Sherlock Holmes stories. We are huge fans of the Jeremy Brett series and we like the way the characters have retained their personalities despite the modern day setting. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are both outstanding in these roles. We also enjoy the updates to the plots. We hope the series continues for at least two or three more seasons.
B007ZYK3CE|4.0|Not for the faint-hearted. The movie accurately portrays a set of people, rich, flawed people, suffering from the human condition.<br /><br />For a more thorough review which expressed my sentiments better than I can, please read \\"As real as it gets\\" January 20, 2013 review by  K. Pinnock
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I guess I'm not one for spy stories.  Atonement was brilliant but I finally went online to find out what I was reading this time.  Never really did discover why a government agency would give a rip about new fiction.
B000WMEAKC|1.0|It must be difficult to sound this uninteresting. This album is nothing but a bunch of Radio and TV type commercial sounds/tunes strung together. If you like a very anonymous sounding band, along with bad production qualities and compressed sound, this is for you.
0195145925|3.0|I read the 1999 book that I bought from Barnes & Noble. After reading it, I had some correspondence with the author. I agree with the book's main point, but feel that this point can be summarized very briefly. See \\"Time Does Not Exist, and the Incompleteness of Knowledge\\", philica.com, article number 188 (2010). You may find this article on my website www.analysis-knowledge.com/msgTeaching.htm.<br /><br />3 stars, as a valid point, but could be stated much more concisely.<br /><br />Here is the article in brief. It is impossible to go to the past, for if we could, then the past would not be past. If time travel to the past exists, then time does not exist. This means that we cannot observe, in principle, the past. When we look at pictures that we took of past events, what we are looking is at the present, the pictures. The past exists only in the sense of the records that exist now. The future, of course, does not yet exist. If neither the past nor the future exists as valid concepts in physics, then neither does time.<br /><br />When physicists speak about time, we speak about records of clocks. We see pictures now of clocks describing the experiments in physics. Although time exists in the equations, the reality is that the only existence is the present. Time in physics equations is merely an intermediate variable, not an actual physical quantity.<br /><br />When physicists refer to time in the framework of special relativity, talking about a fourth dimension calling it time, they mean ict, where c is the speed of light and i is an imaginary number: (x, y, z, ict). Since time exists only in our imagination, it is fitting to multiply t by i.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was hooked with the very first episode and am now five episodes from finishing...am trying to nurse it along so it is not over too soon its a long time until Jan 2014 when it returns
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I think this was the best book I read, this year.  I loved Harold and Maureen.  I was only worried that our hero would die before he made it to Queenie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I play this app 24/7<br />my battery almost died from playing it all the time.you better get the app for me
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I'm disappointed in this product.  I had used the red product, the next higher quality one, which worked MUCH better.  This one flips over every time I go onto a throw rug and spews out all the dirt it has accumulated.  It works OK if I use it ONLY on a smooth surface - ceramic or wood floor.  I bought one to use at home and one in my vacation 'home' but will return the second one and get the better one for $10 more.  Having used the other one that belonged to someone else, it's well worth the extra $10.<br />3 stars.
B003BWERF8|5.0|This is an amazing little product...turns my old nano into one with a wireless feature.  Couldn't have been simpler to use..simply plug in to nano power port, turn on wireless headphones, wait about 15 seconds for the two devices to find one another and you are good to go.  It does require a lot of power..I need to charge my nano every other time I use it..still worth it for the freedom from cords while listening to music at the gym and on my walks.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My kids both play this on their Kindles and love it.  Seems like there is enough on it to be fun, even though it's not the full-blown version.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game, but you have to skip ads. Ït plays pretty quick and I like auto finish. Fun graphics when you win.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|With a name like Wreck-it Ralph, I should have expected the movie to be aggressive. Characters expose too much aggressive behavior towards each other. The movie has a good lesson around acknowledging the good in people, but with the amount of aggression it is not suitable for my 6 & 8 year old to view. It also did not feel good to me as adult to watch through the movie, so we didn't. Graphics was good, unfortunately the presentation of the movie content was in bad taste.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My 12 year old son liked it very much. It was very much in all technical aspects. Highlight was the music.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|This movie was confusing and boring.  A waste of money.  I definitely would not recommend it to anyone.  The worst.
B0091THRCU|1.0|It was awful I put my iPhone 5 in the case and I had cut it out of the case .
B007EECSFA|4.0|Good read, a little predictable but still was satisfied with the book. I would read another of this authors work. Good for a summer book.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I always find it interesting that Jqack Reacher never gets charged for any of this killings! I just satarted reading his series of books.<br />I can see the TV writer coming through in his scenes.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|Just one car wreck or explosion after the other for the entire movie.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Stinks.
B001IF277K|1.0|This item did not work properly work.however, the owner was understanding about the deeffective item<br />The owner sent several batteries to help resolve the issue. I will not worry about the batteries or a refund. I guess its my lost.
B003XZ0WPM|5.0|We rented the Golden Compass as my child was reading the series. It was actually a great movie! I was pleased to see some action and some well told storylines in the same film. Well done.
B0083B3KOQ|1.0|Requires an upload to their server to convert! Waste of money. Should have just copied to my computer and done the conversion myself
B00C5ZORES|1.0|Since from under cork tree this \\"band\\" has been a joke. How can they possibly call their album this? They are a total sell-out pop rock garbage band who are overstaying their 15 mins. I beg of you fob go to school and get real jobs. Your music is terrible.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This book was recommended to my by my language professor. All she told me was that if I am ever feeling down about life read this book. So I did because I was and I cannot wait to read it again next summer to their lives to bring mine a greater and deeper meaning.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I didn't think I could love another hero like I did Hawke, but Kaleb has now taken my heart. Hauntingly beautiful, a story that will make you cry tears if sadness and joy. Redemption has never been so sweet, and love once lost but found again has never been so deserved. 5+ stars!
1449437524|5.0|Hilarious if you are an adult and don't mind some typically inappropriate words. Its a refreshingly honest and funny perspective on how one's dog sees the world.
0780622650|5.0|i liked the flashback to the old t.v. series. although bill mumy didn't appear, they were all very worthwhile. can't wait for redux!

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Watched the episodes with no ability to wait for each one to begin. Cannot wait for the season 3 to get here. I've read all of the books and loved them so much wanted to see the shows.
0240815807|5.0|Learnt a lot from the book, revised my approach to audio editing and mixing. Project studio owner should make this a must buy.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|It's does exactly what it's supposed to do for a decent price. This CAN fit in Mid-sized cases regardless of what some of the reviews say, just do your homework and measure it out. This cooler keeps my AMD Phenom Black II at about 34C idle and 42C during intense gaming. My only complaint is that the instruction for installations were a little unclear and it felt like having 4 arms was a necessity. If you make this purchase, grab a partner and make sure they're around to help you out once it arrives, it'll be a lot easier. I was able to install it while the MoBo was still in the case, but I'm not sure I recommend everyone try that.<br /><br />On a final note: Grab an extra fan - cause why not?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I couldn't stop watching, and I wanted to just keep watching!  Loved it indeed!  I can't wait till Jan for Season 4!

B008HJGPVO|5.0|after trying this stylus I am hooked. So much more responsive to others and a smaller tip helps too.  Have to get another one so I have one upstairs and one downstairs. Yes you can get 6 cheaper ones for same price but the quality is much cheaper too. Buy this one.
B002JT6APO|5.0|The \\"4 Film Favorites Batman Collection \\",was purchased for my son, Caleb. He enjoys superhero ,\\"Batman\\". He had been waiting for this DVD collection for a long time. We could not find the DVD's at our local stores, or online. Even though the stores did indicated that they had them. So, the anticipation was at a very high level for a 8 year old. When we received the package he was very excited. His thoughts regarding the films were to be the best movies ever, \\"he said.\\" Well to his expectation he was elated and grateful for the movies.<br />Thank you for having them available for purchase at AMAZON.
B00915G6YE|4.0|So, I've been a faithful Dexter fan for a while. Picked up seasons 1-6 on DVD. FINALLY got Dexter season 7 on Blu-Ray, but I'm disappointed in this release for several reasons.<br /><br />1) Lack of special features.<br /><br />A) Previous seasons have had at least SOME special features, if not a few. Usually interviews / commentaries. This one seems to have none.<br />B) This season seems to mark a turning point in the show. Dexter's relationship with his sister, the unraveling of Dexter's methodical, uhh, methods for reamining undetected, signals of the beginning of the end. I'd have expected the cast & crew and script writers to have plenty to say about this season in particular. The silence is deafening.<br /><br />For both reasons I'm disappointed.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />2) The deceptive use of UV Digital Copy on this release.<br /><br />Yes, it comes with a UV redemption code. But it blows for two reasons:<br /><br />A) The code is not for what you'd expect it to be for. You DO NOT get a copy of the series on UV. Nope. So why bother adding UV anything at all?<br />B) The code is for only the pilot of a completely different show. Rob something-or-other-I-really-don't-care. Yes, it says what you get on the top of the sticker in \\"fine print,\\" but does anyone ever actually read the stickers? No, we assume when we buy the thing that if we buy Hotel Transylvania with UV, we get Hotel Transylvania with a UV copy *OF* Hotel Transylvania, not a UV copy of something completely different and barely if at all related.<br /><br />It's both a slap in the face and deceptive packaging. Any reasonable person would expect that if there's a UV sticker on the front of the thing, it means you're getting a UV copy of the title you're buying. That's what UV is for. It's not for advertising some product OTHER than the title in question.<br /><br />If I'm buying Dexter, I don't want a copy of Mama's Family or Carebears, or the pilot episode of Zombieland. I want DEXTER. That was what I was expecting. Not until I got home and opened the package did I begin to suspect that the code was not for the title I purchased, but something else. At first I thought, okay, I get Dexter AND a pilot episode of something else. NOPE! JUST the pilot episode of something else. NO DEXTER on UV.<br /><br />Add this to my irritation at the deceptively packaged [[ASIN:B0060MYL3E Breaking Bad - The Fifth Season]] (which is not \\"The Fifth Season\\" bu the FIRST HALF of the season, which is nowhere mentioned in any obvious way).<br /><br />So, basically, this season is a barebones release and you don't get what you'd assume you're getting based on the UV sticker. To me, that's bait & switch. Feel free to vote with your $$ and hope they remedy this problem. Though, I'm not expecting much.<br /><br />Otherwise, the show is still great, picture quality is good, etc. I'm just irritated with the lack of features (especially given there's SOME stuff on SHO's web site relating to this season; would it have killed them to include THAT?) and the lack of a UV copy of the title purchased, despite the UV sticker (which implies, even if it actually states otherwise, that you should be getting a copy of the title you just purchased not what amounts to advertising for something completely different; I didn't intentionally pay to be advertised to, and had I realized the deception I might have reconsidered my purchase).what I was expecting. Not until I got home and opened the package did I begin to suspect that the code was not for the title I purchased, but something else. At first I thought, okay, I get Dexter AND a pilot episode of something else. NOPE! JUST the pilot episode of something else.

B005EGXSWW|5.0|Another excellent mystery from Jo Nesbo, delving into the drug underworld of Oslo. Hole, the grizzled detective, returns from East Asia to resolve the murder of a dealer in 'violin'. Outlining the plot in any serious fashion may reveal the (sensational) ending, but suffice it to say that Hole's personal relationships impede, alter, and finally determine the outcome of his quest. The characters are depicted in exquisite detail. Started reading the book in a coffee bar in Kobe, Japan one afternoon and was completely absorbed for the next couple of days.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|The \\"Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is definitely in my top 3 favorite books, not just because I like the elaborate and very complicated life of Charlie, but as I was reading the book, I felt like I could relate so well to each of the characters and that I was actually there with them, hanging out and talking in the Big Boy, watching the compelling Rocky Horror Picture Show production... I absolutely am in love with this book. I feel so connected to it like what's happening is really happening in my life. I felt sorrow for the characters, happiness, regret, excitement, nervousness. It was a never ending emotional rollercoaster. By the time I finished the book, I was practically in tears. I wanted to follow Charlie further into his life with his friends and watch how he develops into a young adult. I want to see how all of his experiences have shaped his future and see how he turns to out to be when he has children of his own.<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who is able to handle mature concepts, and for anyone looking for romance, drama, or a little bit of both. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is definitely a 5 star book in my opinion. For those who have never read the book and are looking into reading it, let me tell you that it is not a disappointment and you should hopefully be satisfied once you've finished reading.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|Its a good little game. My ten year old enjoys it as its simple enough for him to play. I enjoy it because it doesn't take much brain power!
B002RRN952|4.0|Enjoyed the movie especially when I could see it at home and it only cost 2.99 to watch it in HD.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game I have played 100 doors nd 100 floors. I really feel this is better. Please add more real soon. Dnt be like the others just took too long
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Another great story in the psy/changeling series. I don't want to give anything away but there are definitely some surprises this time around. The storyline was really good and I am glad that we got to know the real Kaleb. If you like the series then this is a must read!!
B005PK57NU|5.0|Watched Season 1 live, so glad you have it in your library.  I watched 3 episodes, but am taking a break.  Wish you had a reasonable season price; cost per episode seems a bit pricey.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|All in all, I enjoyed this book.  I agree with some other reviewers who felt the actions of the main characters was much more mature and level headed this go around.  The ending left everything wide open. I found myself thinking, \\"really, that's where you're going to end it?\\"<br /><br />Here's my main question - why do I have this odd feeling that Gideon is hiding something major?  Is anyone else feeling this?  I keep waiting for the bomb to drop.  How could a man with so much raw sexual energy be satisfied with one woman.  I hope I'm wrong.<br /><br />I'll be watching for the next book, but I don't think I'll pre-order.
B009D8RJR2|5.0|The Fifth Witness was my introduction to Michael Connelly's work.  In my mind, I immediately began to compare him to John Grisham.  I knew it would be hard to knock John off my pedestal, and indeed, it didn't happen.  Actually, Connelly took a seat right beside Grisham.  His crime novels (I'm in the middle of my second one) are just as thrilling, but are just different.  It's a real learning experience when you read Connelly.<br /><br />The topic in The Fifth Witness is detailed and current...foreclosures.  You learn how a bank does it... the step by step process.  Foreclosures are universal,  but the setting for the novel took me aback a little...I'm a New York City retired teacher and Connelly's setting is L.A. I learned some things about L.A. Now, Grisham doesn't stick to Tennessee, but his themes are so personal to me, that I don't think about WHERE they're happening (social injustice, distaste for how the law works , etc.) but WHAT'S happening.<br /><br />Connelly's work is as &#34;up-all-night&#34; surprising and thrilling as Grisham's, but you're always learning...Grisham is the first to tell you he may be 'off' on some legal points, but he's all about the story.  I learned that Connelly's investigator is as important as Mickey Haller, the lawyer, himself.  And who would have compared a musical composition (Bolero) to the way a courtroom procedure would go...reaching a crescendo, etc.?  I loved it.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Get this book for any graduate, kindergarten to college to retirement. In place of a greeting card with cash, stick a bill in this, weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, birthdays.  Better yet, don't wait for a special occasion, share now.  Loved it.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|never played it but its sort of dumb someone told me its like temple run oh btw don't get minecraft 2 and read reviews before u get apps
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|The acting was not good.  The cast did not at all fit the descriptions from the book series.  And overall, the movie seemed as if it was produced on a very low budget.  I would love to see another movie about one of Lee Child's books, but with a completely new cast.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I knew there was music involved and generally, I like musicals, but not every word of dialogue needs to be sung....  I had heard so much good about this and missed seeing it on the big screen.  Frankly, I enjoyed the non-singing version with Liam Neeson better....
B007THA4FI|1.0|It's a shame how much of a let-down this book was. Clearly Rowling was trying to create something entirely different from Harry Potter, understandable. Unfortunately it's clear that Rowling' s strength is a good, plot driven story. This was meant to be character driven, going to explore human nature and human interactions. At times I felt engaged with the characters, but mostly they came across as pretty, mean, and quite honestly, boring. I was very disappointed. If this is all I had to judge by Rowling, I would say she is an extremely mediocre author.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|For an almost computer illiterate person, I found it very easy to connect and use this app! Would recommend it to everyone!!
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|This is a great return for Sabbath.......make sure you buy the extended version,the 3 bonus songs are some of the best on the cd....Only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it sounds,to me,like a mix of Sabbath songs and ozzys band...I love ozzys solo stuff but I wanted more of the Sabbath sound......other than that its great
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Sorry about the pun!!<br /><br />I saw this show twice in London in 1984 and once in Chicago in 1985 and this was so much like the London shows!!  I have the soundtrack on cassette (!!) and this is so much better.  The CD 'extras' are great too.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I can't believe how good the new Sabbath album is. I was nervous and ready to be disappointed, but that didn't happen. After repeated listening, standout songs for me are \\"Loner,\\" \\"Age of Reason,\\" and \\"Damaged Soul.\\" Iommi hasn't sounded so good since the mid 70's and Ozzy sounds great on the album. Lyrically, there are some clinkers, but also some good stuff. Hate on Ozzy or Rick Rubin if you want, but this album is evidence for the genius of both. Iommi and Butler can't do this high quality of work without Ozzy, and I doubt the three of them would have pulled this off without Rubin's guidance.Aside from the absence of Bill Ward, my only complaint about the album is the title.\\"13\\" is just stupid. Any number of song titles on the album would have worked as titles for the album including \\"Age of Reason,\\" \\"End of the Beginning,\\" \\"Live Forever,\\" and \\"Zeitgeist\\".
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. They some great ideas for all kinds of things. I got my last hair cut and color from Pinterest.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome it passes time and you get points every time you beat a mini game then you have to make a higher score and with those points you buy games so irresolute never ends
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Another of her excellent action/ adventure films. Well done with a lot of action. Easily as good as Mr. & Mrs. Smith or her other adventure films
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was a refreshing change to what I have been reading. Once I started, I could not put it down. The turmoil between Travis & Abby fighting the inevitable just kept me reading. I could feel the torment Abby was feeling throughout the book & wanted to smack her the next.. I laughed & I cried. This is a must read!
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|The album wasn't for me, but still heard it and now OMG I totally love it, one of my favorites albums ever...I'm proud to say I'm a Paramore fan now! whay a piece of art
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I am not able to access everything.  Why can't I access my magazines in newsstand? I do like that I can access documents!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this game because you can build mansions and you can build the world your way and build a YMCA.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Good clean stuff for a  pleasant change.  Rating it with stars is good enough.<br />I think you should dump this stupid survey. blah blah blah blah blah!!!!!!!!
B00CFQMVLS|5.0|My husband & I loved this movie. I know the reviews were not great, not sure why. They spent a great deal of money making this movie and it shows in the action scenes. If you like Bruce Willis, I think you will enjoy this movie.
B00ADYYY50|5.0|I NEVER HEARD OF THIS ARTIST UNTIL I LISTENED TO PANDORA RADIO  HE HAS A NICE SWAG ABOUT HIM & HIS MUSIC I LOVED IT VERY MUCH
0385349947|5.0|Every woman and man should read this book, except that Sandberg really doesn't explain how a child feels being raised by someone other than her mother or father. She describes the plight of women brilliantly but does dodge the bullet when it comes to child rearing. I don't think women &#34;can have it all&#34; even though she does a good pitch for that.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|An incredible tool! With this software one is only limited by his or her own imagination.  Each day I give it a new challenge, so far it hasn't failed to deliver.
B002KR7NTC|5.0|For a US/British viewer Terry Thomas steals the show but it is just great fun watching the flow of the movie! You don't need to know French for this to work, but it does help.  The visual humor and timing of the international cast makes this a classic for all cultures. Chaplin resisted talkies because he felt they would hinder international understanding.  This film proves Chaplin wrong.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|MAN THIS CHICK REALLY PLAYED HER PART TO THE MAX , SHE HAD ME FOOLED SHE WAS AN CON ARTIST TO THE BONE, WOW BUT WHAT A GREAT JOB WITH THE STORY LINE NICELY PLOTTED
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Can't wait to see where Gideon and Eva take us next! Love reading about this functionally dysfunctional couple!! Hurry up 4th book!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A new author for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will try another one of his books in the near future.
B003ZA0BCY|5.0|Brendan Fraser is perfect in timing and character development.  The show moves with you going from suspension of belief to concern for all the character.  It is a great what if/ you can't wait to see how they will work it out.  Great cast.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I've been playing this game almost every day since I downloaded it. It's still fun and relaxing even after I conquered the last level.  Great graphics and sounds!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great reading adventure.  Anyone who likes to see the underdog win out in the end.  Always a unexpected twist in the story.
B004L03B3S|3.0|It is delightful once your understand that it is a movie and rarely mirrors reality (thought, I am sure that it does occur, but the boundaries crossed seem somewhat surreal. I suspect that parents would have been more adamant about the what most people would believe to be rather taboo, including yours truly.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Explains all the details of how things came to be. Very good action movie and the characters were spot on.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Every song on this cd is fantastic.  Kelly Clarkson knows how to write and sing songs. my son loves listening too!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Nicholas Hoult was excellent in this casting!  The young female part was also an excellent choice.  Saw her in I Am Number Four, and this was quite a change from the superhero type!  However, it's good to see versatility in an actress.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|I love this movie.  I'm glad we got this one cuz we had never seen many parts in it that were not in the original.  Would recommend to anyone.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Quick empowering read about women &#34;Leaning In&#34; and &#34;Sitting at the table&#34;. I love the positivity and advice given by Sheryl. We are aware that no one has the same journey or opportunities but the spirit of equality for Women rings true!  i especially loved the topic concerning women paying it forward and being supportive of other women; respecting and valuing a woman's choice to work inside or outside of the home.  What an encouraging and eye-opening read. I'm Leaning In!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the random games were all good and very playable even for a child. some are harder than others which is a nice touch.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I am a big fan of her novels she is a great writer and I have been reading her Scarpetta books from the very first one
B005M5OSBK|5.0|My daughter introduced me to this group and I liked their sound. I like this one best of the three I got, but they are all good.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Excellent writing from these writers. They constantly keep you on the edge of your seat. They have multiple story lines that come together to deliver an outstanding finale!
B00CC1JXYE|3.0|the case works good.  it doesn't protect the top/bottom portion of the phone, so if you drop it, you will ding it (i did it), asides from that, it doesn't feel solid but i like the feature to open/close to view time.
B003VVAE4W|5.0|Liked everything about these episodes.  Only ones I missed in season 2.  Wish they would bring back the show to TV.  I think everyone would enjoy this show and the four episodes I purchased from Amazon.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series. My wife and I really enjoy watching it, especially during these times that the NBA finals take up all TV..
0525952926|4.0|Many true facts<br />another written in small font making reading difficult to read<br />historically accurate<br />Outstandingly written for holding interest
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app. It is a must have if you're into picture editing. It has so many options to use and many different tools.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|Loved it. loved it. loved it.  Can't think of anything negative to say about this episode I purchased from Amazon.
B003L77FYS|5.0|One of the best shows on t v. would recommend to anyone to watch. Season 5 should even be better this year.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|It was a really enjoyable movie.  Unlike the current crop of television productions I could and did understand the actors speaking level, their voice projection, and their pronunciation.  Television productions, one example being &#34;Falling Skies&#34;, I rate very low because I cannot hear and understand what the actors are saying.  Given this major problem with television productions, even when they appear to have an interesting story line and fair video, although they are often visually to dark to tell what is going on because of poor lighting techniques, we gave up even trying to follow such series productions.  Even the voices in the series Premiere this week were so poor we gave up and stopped watching.<br /><br />Star Trek's production and story line is great as is the action, the video and the sound.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like to play this game just to relax and use up time. This version is very good. I like the fact you can just touch the screen to make the next move.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved this movie! I watched it on Amazon Prime and thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. It's nice to get a great list of newer movies to choose from and then be able to watch them instantly in your own home, too.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I sure hope Rodriquez is getting something out of this after 30 years of pirating his work in South Africa
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I'm not real keen on books that have to do with the murder of children.  So from the beginning I was not sure if I wanted to keep reading. I do miss the old Brennen novels.  I just haven't been enamored by Reich's last works.  They are OK, but not as enjoyable as her earlier ones.  I will still read her novels, but I am still waiting for  a new one that I can rate 5 stars.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I waited so long for this book and was left hanging again....  the story has been drawn out and to many characters to keep up with.
B00BP3DPJY|3.0|In my honetht opinion, thith ith a tholid album. Thometimeth I lithten to it when I'm trying to fall athleep and altho thing along to it ath part of my lithp correction therapy.
0375869026|4.0|My daughter liked this book. She is often a little shy of different people & feels so bad for them. I think this book gave her a good idea of the kids behind these faces. I hope it helps the afflicted & their peers. This should be a grade school read.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Great read. The love and passion between the 2 main character is crazy . I wish it didn't end the way it did but it opens a door for more books :)
B00CSWA1PM|5.0|Great cast album of the most enjoyable show on Broadway this year.  Diverse and original score written by Cindi Lauper
B004ZQ74G8|4.0|told from the point of view of an isolated five year old, the author really captures what it is like to be inside the head of a child who's world is severely limited.  she manages to evoke a deep pathos for the situation using his innocent scope.  lovely writing. disturbing subject matter.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I've been using this app for a week now it works much better... then all of the other battery app combines!!!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|This not good at all! Ill try to play youtube viedo and it stays loading and loading forever to the point where i use the regular internet. I highly recommend you do not Down load this app however i have a kindle fire hd so it may be driffent on the kindle fire.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Fun little puzzle game. Challenging enough if you go for three stars on everything. The sound effects are repetitious though.
1878424319|5.0|I bought six, one for my daughter, granddaughter, two brothers and sister and myself.  We are all enjoying the book!  I'm going to purchase Don Miguel's Ruiz other books as well.  My granddaughter bought one of his books in Nepenthe in Big Sur, California.  Big Sur is such a beautiful and tranquil place to sit and read his books...  I recommend it and will read it again and again :)
0307270807|5.0|A young reporter goes to Vietnam during the very height of hostilities in Southeast Asia.  Unlike any young marine or army soldier, Michael Herr has choices to make.  Where are the stories?  Is it in the clubs and dens of Saigon or Da Nang or is it in the Central Highlands with the First Cav or the Fourth Infantry Division or was it up in I Corps with the marines at Khe Sanh.  Herr got a chance, unlike any soldier, to go to all these areas and describe to one and all what was really happening in Vietnam.  His education was far advanced to any soldier who served usually in a small area of operation for his or her tour of Vietnam.<br /> The stories unfolded in this book are irreverent and straightforward, infantry language and all.  It conveys the attitudes, fears and concerns that marines and soldiers dealt with in their combat tours in Vietnam.  Herr tells us the mindsets of the soldiers whether in the field or in the supposed REMF (Rear Echelon Mother F------s) areas.  But as explained by Herr there really is no rear area.  Whether in built up areas such as Da Nang, Saigon and Hue there really was no safe haven in Vietnam.  Vietnam was a war where you could get killed anywhere.<br /> In Herr's stories he brings the unadulterated truth.  He holds no bars, even in his attitudes with the higher authorities who he knew were not telling the full story of just who was \\"winning\\" the war.  Herr along with his other youthful peers are able to go where the action is.  They are not shy about going with troopers who were put into harm's way.  These reporters do not shy away from danger, and in many instances put themselves in just as much peril as any marine or cav trooper.<br /> Of special interest in this book Herr devotes much time in I Corps with the marines in the battle of Khe Sanh.  He makes a valid comparison of the siege of Khe Sanh with the siege of Dien Bien Phu.  He tells of the similarities but also relates why the siege was broken by the Americans, whereas the French were defeated 14 years before.<br /> One thing which intrigued me was Herr's evaluation of what he thought were the best troopers fighting in Vietnam.  They were not the marines.  They were in his opinion the First Cavalry Division as quoted in the book.  \\"And now, everywhere you went, you could see the most comforting military insignia in all of Vietnam, the yellow-and-black shoulder patch of the Cav.  You were with the pro's now, the elite.\\"<br /> This is a visceral book which will let you go into the mindsets of the men who served in this much misunderstood war fought in Southeast Asia.ench were defeated 14 years before.<br /> One thing which intrigued me was Herr's evaluation of what he thought were the best troopers fighting in Vietnam.

B001I9TK1W|5.0|This is just one of my favorite movies for reasons too numerous to name.<br /><br />For instance the opening fight scene has Bruce win by submission technique. They also are using gloves with fingers in them. This sort of thing would not become common place until 1993's UFC debut.<br /><br />Roper and Williams are also delightful and fun characters.<br /><br />Worth the price of admission just to see Bruce Lee demonstrate the Art of Fighting Without Fighting.
B004R0V53K|5.0|After 25 years this book is still my favorite.  It's as deep or superficial as your personal capacity requires.  A book for everyone.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|I am a huge Vampire weekend, this cd is great.  It shows that they are evolving but staying true to their sound.  A must buy for a real fan.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Get it it's very vary scary  my Brother thinks it's scarry jest get it<br />Look to they should add a update
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I saw this in the theatre with my daughter and we liked it.<br />I love the colors and the special effects in it!<br />The movie is good for those who are open-minded to a<br />variety of movies with colorful special effects with humor :)
B003102JDM|5.0|Another good film from the Coen brothers, whose other films include Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou, and The Big Lebowski, to name just a few. This one is a semi-autobiographical story of growing up in a Jewish community in Minnesota in the sixties. The opening of the film is a theatrical and cultural gem. The story of a college professor who has reached a time of crisis in his life, and is trying to understand why in spiritual terms, is both serious and funny, though perhaps a bit confusing at first. It's one of those movies that you end up thinking about for days afterwards, and getting more and more from it the more you think about it. Though it does seem to want to tackle some philosophical themes, it manages to do so in a funny, nostalgic, and thoughtful way. The soundtrack, which includes Jefferson Airplane, adds to the great sixties ambience. I highly recommend it.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I'm a huge eagles fan and a band documentary collector.  It's very cool to see how things came to be.  From how they got started in the music business to how they met and the very interesting way in which they created some of the best songs from the 70s.  If you like taking a deep look into the band.  I highly recommend this doc.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is the beast in the world but they should put an end portal and ender portal and red stone items that is the inlet things that are keeping me from a five star review
B000002WYT|2.0|I believe DMB has had better albums, i guess nothing will live up to their &#34;Stand Up&#34; album for me.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This was a great one-see.  This film needs to be watched from start to finish to truly appreciate it.  It's witty and fantastic at its peak, bland and time consuming at its lull.  Would I suggest it to my best, good, ok, or semi-friends, YES.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this for my 14 year old daughter who loves animals of all kinds. She plays it all the time an loves it.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I like this game because it has good graphics and it is really easy to use.....but once u buy the game it only gives you like half the game. If you want to unlock stuff u have to pay money for it.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|This was a good movie, i truly was happy to see a Action Icon on the big stage again.  And he played his role well.  An aged Sherriff looking to wind it down, when things go to crap.  I enjoyed the movie alot.  Welcome back Arnold
B00881PTRC|2.0|If you're familiar with words like Slijmappel and pluote than this game is for you. As for the rest of us, you'll need a dictionary for every other word.  Gets old fast when you have no idea what word you are trying to guess.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|One of my favorite movies in years.  Seriously though, does the star look like a French Dustin Hoffman to anyone else?
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|It was a great movie glad I bought it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone that watched it thought it was really good . And will pass it on to the rest of my family to watch.
B000056K04|3.0|It is not better than Stand up, just my opinion.  I love 1 or 2 songs, but it still is not Stand Up
B000OVLINI|5.0|My daughter gave me this book for Mother's Day.  She enjoyed it and thought I would also.  She was right.<br /><br />Creative plot and characters...lots of new ways to see old conflicts.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this is the best weather app by far.i have tried others but this one is far better its a good app
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I loved every moment of this show! Great performances, beautiful women, fun insight into the lives the great players of a past age.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|It was a good movie, John McClane doing what he does best... finding trouble.  It was a good movie... perhaps a bit unnecessary in my opinion.. Live Free or Die Hard was awesome and had that final touch feeling to it... but i guess the door opened again and this is acceptable.  I enjoyed this movie though.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am hooked! I've enjoyed this app so much that I uninstalled it so I could  start over... TWICE! Much better  than the arcade game. Cheaper too!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|My first paid Kindle book. I LOVE it. It's a great story, easy to navigate, and I love that you can see other's highlights. It also has a handy explanation of characters and relationships, which in this book series, can get pretty confusing. Very good. I'll be buying the rest of the series.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Action was okay but there was barely enough details to string together to make sense of this movie.  I suppose it might of been better if i had read the book and already knew the story.  I assume by the ending that there are plans for a 2nd movie, I doubt I will watch it if it gets made.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|The first CG movie to just blow us away.... and if you enjoyed the movies as much as I did, you have to own this cool Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy Gift Set (Blu-ray + Digital Copy).  Its epic
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I originally uploaded this for my 3year old to play while we were on a trip her and I now play together everyday  I don't recommend it for travel since you do need a connection to play
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Great plot twists that I did not see coming.  I found it very enjoyable and great acting by several of the characters.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Not a bad song on the album; catchy tunes, lyrics that tell a story, a must have for any Blake Shelton fan and for anyone that enjoys solid, good music!  A wonderful playlist for the summer....pop it on when you're out on the deck with a micro brew and steaks on the grill.
B0088D3PYE|5.0|Re-read the shadows of the wind again before starting the Prisoner of Heaven as I wanted to familiarise my self with the characters again , and glad I did , but not absolutely necessary, Brilliant book , with wonderful one liners , and wide open for another book to emerge from this story ,Cannot wait for the next instalment.....................Zafon is at his superb best once again !
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love this game but it is way too expensive to play. There are too many ponies that cost hundreds of gems to get and ponies you have to gamble for by spending even more gems. I might earn one or maybe two gems a day. Also the game has a ton of glitches when comes to connecting to Facebook and even gameloft. Most of the time my friends list won't even come up so I can't receive or send hearts. The hardest thing is for me is to go to my friends towns and leave chests (about 80% of the time I can't). Other than those things I do love the game play and animation.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Not exactly what I expected. But, neither was the Twilight series. I can only compare to that series because it comes so far from left field. Can't get a handle on trying categorize or rate.  The writing is not good but it didn't stop me from reading all three.  So to sum up, I guess it was an okay and I rarely write reviews.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Really enjoyed this. A Michael Connelly book is always a good read. Will definitely get more of his books in the future.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Enjoyed the imagination used in the filming and found it very entertaining.  the acting was very good.  A Good family film.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|This is not a remake nor should  it be compared to the original &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;...with that in mind, the cinematography is amazing and as a stand alone story line, I really liked it.  It's an excellent family movie, it really is!  It's considered a &#34;Prequel&#34; in the sense of how the wizard got to Oz and the story behind the witches. (Think &#34;Wicked&#34; without the singing)  But stop comparing to the classic movie, for Pete's sakes!  Let's be realistic...this is not the 30s and this movie was not made to be compared to the original.  It's rather enjoyable!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very helpful  and the buttons are very easy to use and see I would recommend it to a friend thank you
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Tried out the free version of this game and liked it so much I spent the mere 99&cent; so I didn't have to deal with ads.  It was worth it!  Great game!
B0091REZMW|5.0|game is fun and easy to get help. only issue is after exploring a couple of the rooms it forces close. please fix.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is such a good game I love it I get to do what I get to do on a horse that's why I love it
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I was expecting a little more from this movie.  Excellent visuals. and have all three venues for viewing it on all my devices.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|LOVE it!  Very compelling, only I wish they would have cast someone else as Javert (someone who could actually sing)...
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I like this game because at times it is easier and then becomes more difficult. I sometimes feel that the bubbles don't go the way that I have them aimed.
B004P12SSW|3.0|I personally think this movie should be rated R, for nudity if nothing else, though I don't remember anything being shown head-on. That's just fyi.<br />I expected a musical, and there is lots of music, but this seemed more like a striptease kind of movie than anything. I highly recommend to adults who like to watch half-naked ladies dance, since that's what this movie is, with a little bit of romance, I guess. If you're looking for a good musical, I suggest one other than this, since I didn't really enjoy it as such. It's good for what it is, I guess, an alright movie, but I was disappointed.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Great movie, great visuals.....great price. I like the fact that I can get all three, Blu-ray, DVD and digital copies.
B004GWQT5I|5.0|I liked it, it draws you in, psychologically thrilling, not like some of the stupid, gory supposed &#34;scary&#34; movies...rent this one
1469220725|5.0|I loved the book!!!  I enjoyed all of the detail and not skipping large gaps of time. I am looking forward to having more books with Eva & Gideon to continue their story in more detail and hot steamy scenes.  I have to admit I'm a little frustrated over the feelings Eva has toward Brett and her inviting him to her apartment.  It's fine to keep him in the story line, but drop the sexual attraction Eva has for him.  Keep writing Sylvia and it would be nice if the books are not released so far apart!!!  With the delay of Entwind I felt like had to go back and read Reflected to remember where we left off.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|This film is a bit different from traditional horror movies, and thus a classic of its own kind. The acting was a little over-dramatic at times, I feel, and the storyline, though a little slow, was interesting. I recommend for fans of the horror genre.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Always a Bond fan. Again having all three venues lets me watch it again and again on all devices. But later found the price cheaper elsewhere.....
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a really cute game; our 5-year old loves to play this one.  All kids who love the little ponies will love this game.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've had several different sound machines over the years and enjoyed all of them, but this app is so much better than anything I've had before.  I love that you can mix your own sounds to make it perfect for your mood and needs.  I used this while having a migraine the other day and was amazed at how much easier it was to relax through the pain.
B00BP4ZNFM|4.0|As with most things that are idealized in our society, I'm always a little disappointed when I watch a highly-praised older film. This, of course, is an example of one of those things. It is a great movie, and I highly recommend it for any family night, but don't expect everything it's cracked up to be. This is a really great movie and clean fun, but my expectations were too high, I think. If you haven't seen this, and you're into clean sci-fi adventures, I highly recommend this to you.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The visuals in this movie are fabulous. I have watched in both Blu-ray and 3D and it's a feast for the eyes.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is a good addition for Minecraft lovers; my 9-yr old grandson loves it (I am going by his review)
B00785P2QC|5.0|Awesome game truly time consuming enjoy the real feeling of running my own city great graphics a really good buy money well spent. Cheap and inexpensive tokens
B006GM8NXM|5.0|First, a few warnings: LOTS of sex scenes and profanity. Definitely should be rated NC-17 or higher.<br />Second, my review: This show is very addictive. It's not just about vampires and sex, it's about racism, murder, and being different. A quite complex show that will have you watching episode after episode after episode. Also, I laugh a lot, I think it's funny. A great show. Once you start watching, you won't be able to stop, I mean, unless you turn it off during a sex scene, and there are plenty of those. I highly recommend for mature adults who like sci-fi, paranormal, romance, or just great complex stories with the previously-mentioned elements. A five star series so far.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book was as good as the first one.  I loved the new characters and twists during the game to keep it interesting and fun to read.  Loving forward to reading the final book.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Both 5 year old & 9 year old love this games; they play it for hours on the Nabi.  Great for dinosaur lovers.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app it's great and really fun!  I give it 5 stars anybody seeing this should try the game out.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The whole trilogy was extremely well written.  I had to get the next one as soon as I finished each one.  Loved how it was all wrapped up.
B007YOC4RW|5.0|Good album, but most all Bonamassa stuff is top notch. Dam......I'd love to see him in person. Maybe some day?
B008J34466|5.0|Its Pink enough said. Wife loves it. I can't admit to it since I'm a guy...but let just say I sometimes sing some of her songs at random...but ONLY because the wife replays the album over and over ;P
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun for kids,adults,and more.when u play this game your just like wow this game is amazing.i also think this game let's your imagination run and be free and I think you will really enjoy this game!!! so I hope I inspired you to buy this awesome game.<br />  thanks for reading my review!!!  Bye:)
B00AB7HESI|2.0|As novel as the concept is, the puzzles are either very simple or strangely very very precise in how one can solve them. This aspect took most of the &#34;gameplay&#34; out of me. Wouldn't buy again.
B00CE004XM|1.0|Sure Joe is playing his guitar, but his voice is a big part of his talent. On this album no voice from Joe and Beth is just plain ordinary..........
B00006879E|5.0|Love it! The CD along with the instant Auto RIp was a fantastic buy! Many great songs by a great band!
B00594XOZU|5.0|It is so fast and reliable. The app never glitches, and  never needs to load. If i could, rate it higher. I wpuld
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|The game places you as a hungry shark that must constantly eat or die. Pretty simple in concept and to be honest not much else it needed. Great graphics and fun game play but eventually very limiting. The game is based off of the &#34;Freemium&#34; pay model, so eventually to progress, one either has to either grind for money or pay for upgrades. Too bad the upgrades are largely pointless past the halfway upgrade mark. Would be nice if a randomized showed up with updates, so far no luck.
1439170916|5.0|An excellent writer that takes you on a historical trip demonstrating the impact of this group f diseases on both the individual and our society.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I would watch this again. Clever story line. Very well acted. The bad guy is pretty creepy to say the least.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love it!  Great way to keep the brain working.  Never thought it would make me a MAHJONG addict though.  Really glad I found this way to pass free time.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Crashed after 2nd time. Never worked again even after re-install. Too bad, graphics were nice and I dug the upgrade structure.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It has a lot of what seems to be hidden twists and hints that may or may not have anything to do with the plot.  I recommend it to anyone who likes a little mystery in their stories.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|First outing, nieces high school graduation. All camera stuff was in bag. Easy to carry and easy sling over back when shooting.<br />Great buy!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love this app I was amazed at all the info it actually provided its much better the the Weather Channel app
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I loved the begining, the middle, of course, the end, however, not so much. It was very unexpected and shocking. I did not like it cause I hate to think a 16 year old boy had to go through all that. So that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Don't get me wrong it is a great book, it's just not for everybody, specially the end.
B00BMKDTNC|1.0|Let's start with the fact....they killed Bela? Now what sense does that make? Rand rides away as Moridin into a sunset wondering which of his women will follow him? This just sucks as an ending....so many possibilities and this is what they choose to write about? 0 stars if I had a choice
B005HE5J7I|5.0|The book traces the roots of London to today. What is there that has attracted to this city for centuries?
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Recommend, but I love musicals.  If you love musicals, I suspect you too will enjoy this season.  I never watched on tv.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|I just can't get enough of soft jazz singers.  This is the first CD I've bought of Madeleine's music and I'll buy more.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS just gets better and better!<br />This was one great season! I can't wait to go back and rewatch it for all the little plot lines I may have missed the first time!
0765365278|5.0|Okay, first I have to say I have no idea why I never heard of this book before now!  It's an amazing book and I definitely recommend it to fantasy readers and even fantasy light readers.  There wasn't a single character I didn't like.  The thing that really makes this a 5 star review though is the amazing pacing the novel has.  This is  a 1000 page novel that never lags or gets boring.  I don't think I've ever read a book of this length that kept me suspended for the entire work.  Not only that but the tension ratchets up at the end which left me eagerly waiting for the next book.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Really Sylvia? Really? I waited months for this book only to have it end abruptly in the middle of a crisis with no closure at all? What on earth are you playing at? I gave this series a chance after LOVING Fifty Shades and although there are similarities it was different enough to keep my interest. I waited months for this book (after a delay) hoping to have a nice happy ending and what I get instead is a cliff hanger with a rehash of the last book with no resolution to any conflict which was mentioned in the previous books. I read A LOT, numerous books a week and it takes quite a bit for me to buy a book, let alone three, at normal publishing prices. I won't be spending my money on anything you have written ever again. Severely Dissapointed. I don't know if we readers just assumed this was a trilogy and were wrong or you weren't sure what a trilogy was so just in case; Merriam-Webster defines trilogy as: TRILOGY: a series of three dramas or literary works or sometimes three musical compositions that are closely related and develop a single theme.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. Nothing else to say. One of the best books I've ever read. Made a good movie as well.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|COOL BUT NOW IT DOSENT WORK ON MY KINDLE NOW. I LOVE IT BUT I CANT GET ON IT. IT LET ME ON ONCE BUT NOW DOSENT WORO NOW. ILL SEE IF I CAN GET IT TO WORK. IF IT DOES YEAHHHHHHH. DOSENT CRAPPPPPPPPP
B004L0NGEC|4.0|This is a great app it really works.I've placed all my plcs in albums, now its easy to find my photos.
B009IJJ712|4.0|Casting Watson as a woman is a great idea. Lucy Lou carries off the sober (in the not got any sense of humor sense) Watson character well, possibly too well. I watched the entire first season more or less all at once and she only really smiled once - in the pub scene with her friends who were staging a mini intervention. the other cast members are interesting for being/looking more &#34;real&#34; and kudos for that. I would like to see more of the sponsor character and the housekeeper/transvestite character.<br /><br />The Holmes character is indeed, beautiful, as his soon to be lover said. That said, the script writers and editors need to step up their game. A British genius like Holmes would not mispronounce French words or use poor grammar. For example, when searching a desk, Holmes says he spent an afternoon with a desk and found 12 (or some other number) cachets, pronounced ka-shay, the correct word is cache, pronounced &#34;cash.&#34; A small thing, but mighty distracting.<br /><br />I am not sure why other reviewers think this it is witty; it certainly is not. This Holmes could certainly use a bit of the Puckish humor that other Holmes have brought to the character.  Also, a professional woman who has now invaded two male dominated professions probably would not wear those ridiculous clothes.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This movie was funny because of Cameron Diaz. It did take me awhile to watch it but that was because of the kids.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Supper Funny.  Love catching up on this great series.  Can't wait to get Season 6 next time.  Nerds are so cool.
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|The movie followed the graphic novel quite, but is was equally violent.  The plot was every bit as excellent as I've come to expect from the Batman series.
B000002GYW|5.0|I now have this on vinyl, tape and CD.  A great theme based album that had lot's of good songs.  Pity that some were never given the recognition they deserved.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app on my phone and Kindle...I love it! My husband has it on his phone and iPad...we travel quite a bit for his job and it is easy to add and remove location and we always know what the weather is at home!
1623420148|4.0|Nice to read from the male pov and with a very refreshing, comedic style. Would have like better physical descriptions of the male character,Drew. Overall and enjoyable read.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|The movies followed the graphic novel quite well, but it was equally violent.  The plot was every bit as excellent as I've come to expect from the Batman series.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|For the generation that watched the original series back in the 60s, I enjoyed the subtle references to the original TV show.<br />Although the storyline and plot are mininimal, it has more depth than the currently popular action movies such as Iron Man and the Avengers.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|This book has a ton of excellent information on body weight exercises. It also has a ton of &#34;hey I was in prison&#34; moments that really don't add anything to the book. All the people I know who we're in prison try not to bring it up but it seems like the author wears it as a badge that must be shown every 20 words.
1616550414|5.0|Book came in great shape sealed and preserved upon arrival. It was definitely a steal for its price, as it contained so much never-before-seen character and level designs, and is wonderful to look through even for those that aren't the biggest Zelda fans :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|everyone knows the kindle sucks. But when is the 0.7.0 update coming out? I can't connect to my iPad anymore!
1781162646|3.0|I once said Stephen King could write the alphabet on toilet paper and I'd probably buy a copy. Joyland pretty much solidifies that harsh sentiment. It proves that he can pretty much write what he wants, and no matter who publishes it or what they try to market it as, it will sell just because the book has his name on it.<br /><br />I'd probably given this book 4 stars had it not been published by Hard Case Crime, a small company that prides itself on publishing hard boiled pulp crime thrillers with scantily clad women on their covers and Dick Tracey looking detectives with gray coats, smoking cigs, and hand guns often cozying up to them. Think back to your daddy's 70s porn mags he hid at the bottom of the wicker basket next to the toilet and you've got a winner.<br /><br />After you've read Joyland, take a hard look at the book cover again and you'll definitely roll your eyes.  The scene on the front has nothing to do with King's story.  The red head pictured is a minor character, but hey, sex sells, right?  Wanna see an even worse cover?  Go to Hard Case Crime's website and check out the limited edition hard cover!  YIKES!  HCC is obviously trying to make the book fit into their repertoire, but this book definitely won't appeal to their long-time aging fans who dog ear the pages until their next bowel movement.<br /><br />It is no where near being pulp but the story itself is definitely a winner. It really belongs in another one of King's 4 piece anthologies, like Four Past Midnight or something. It has the coming-of-age appeal of The Body (Stand By Me for you moviegoers), which was in the anthology Different Seasons.<br /><br />The story is about a college kid named Devin who goes to work for an amusement park one summer. The now aging narrator reminisces on how he got his heart broke, chose to skip college and stay on at the park, lost his virginity, saved a little girl's life, and captured the hearts of both kids and adults when he had to dress up as the park's mascot.  Sound familiar?  Eh, it's nothing you haven't read before and nothing that King hasn't already done...and better!  King once advised aspiring writers to \\"kill their darlings.\\"  It's about time he listened to his own advice!<br /><br />But oh yeah, throw in a female ghost that got killed in the park and haunts one of the rides and a sick kid who is a psychic and can read minds and see ghosts. Devin befriends the boy and finds himself trying to solve the ghost girl's murder, but both of those are minor plot points that don't really matter until you are well over half way done with the book! And both of those plot lines have boring and predictable outcomes.  I guessed who the killer was well before that, and was right.<br /><br />Was this King's best?  Ahem...No!  Was it his worst?  Definitely not. Chances are he published it by itself to give ode to HCC, a publisher that focuses on a genre King has a lot of respect for.  And it's a lucrative step in giving the Ebook industry a snub (this book is not available in Ebook format so readers have to buy a hard copy if they want to read it). He'd never do that though with a larger more serious tome (Dr. Sleep is due out in September!). I'm glad I read it though and yes, I'll read the next toilet-time book he writes, whether it is written on TP or not!mascot.  Sound familiar?

B007BFSYMS|4.0|I can't fall asleep to silence or need to drown out other noises. Here's your app. Started off with free version and liked it, now I've paid the wee price for additional features and like it that much more. Several sounds to choose from.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have looked forward to this book for awhile now, and it did not disappoint!  I absolutely love the Crossfire series.  This book was what I needed to fill in some blanks...on the other hand I didn't think that it would leave me hanging...there's another BOOK!  But I have to say Sylvia Day does not disappoint. All I have to say is hurry up with the other BOOK! I don't know how long I can take this..I have to wait for hopefully what is the end of the story. I have to know what happens to Eva and Gideon! If you haven't read the Crossfire series from Sylvia Day...all I can ask is What Are You Waiting For?!?!!!!!
0385349947|4.0|I love this book. I have gained great knowledge reading it and plan to share the learned experience with others..
B00138H5MY|5.0|This may not be the best ever performance of Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto but it certainly is the most lush and romantic. No one can play this like Horowitz. Rachmaninoff himself approved.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|I will start out by saying two things. One, this movie is not entirely fiction. What i mean is, the situation and conflict present in The Descendants does happen from time to time in the real world. Two, Despite the ONE con I have, this passively honest movie gets a solid A+ in my book.<br />The movie stars George Clooney as Matt King, Shailene Woodley as his daughter Alexandra, Judy Greer as his wife Julie, and Matthew Lillard as Brian Speer. George Clooney was terrific, Shailene Woodley was excellent and the remaining supporting cast did his/her job exceptionally well. I also really admired the scenery and where the movie was shot. There are just gorgeous set pieces and settings in the movie that go well with the overall tone. The story line has a strong message and shows some of the struggles of how to be a parent.<br />My only con with the movie is there is so much profanity. And I know there are those who will say things like \\"well what about this movie?\\" or \\"well this movie has curse words too!'' And the movie IS rated R so obviously, I would not highly recommend this for younger children.<br /><br />Is The Descendants a perfect movie? No but it is very close. To describe this movie in one full sentence: Stunningly relatable and more absorbing than you would think, The Descendants goes to show that sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are exactly the same.<br /><br />4 Stars
0345803507|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy. It's like a great love story with all the real obstacles of life. Great book but you won't be able to let it go.
0007107927|5.0|I love this book. I have gained great knowledge reading it and plan to share the learned experience with others..
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I had been looking for a good action/fantasy game for a quite some time and then I found this game. I couldn't get enough! The graphics in the game are amazing. Being a girl I loved the fact that they offer a girl character! One of the best parts of the game is the multiplayer, you can do co-op, PvP, and Team death matches.
B000W799NU|5.0|For a lot of films (past & present) a movie adaptation that is nearly 3 hours long is frowned upon or either criticized for being too long. But it is good and pleasing when a movie adaptation IS that long and stays true to the original novel; that is the case entirely with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Daniel Radcliffe Was wonderful yet again as Harry Potter who is set to begin his 2nd year at Hogwarts. We have all the original cast: Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Robbie Coltrane,  Richard Harris, and Alan Rickman. They all did exceptionally well as Ron, Hermione, Draco, Hagrid, Dumbledore, and Snape. Every performance was on point. Newcomers include: Jason Isaacs (really great actor) as Draco's father Lucius Malfoy. I really enjoyed his take on the character. Next we have the guy that (directed another great film Thor) Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart. He did a great job and also brought a lot of humor to the movie as well. In this story, right before Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he receives a warning from a elf named Doby to not return to Hogwarts. But we all know there would be no need for a movie or much less a story if Harry did not return, thus we have a movie that is suspenful, magical, and wonderful for the eyes and the imagination. With no dull moments and truly aspiring performances, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets gets<br /><br />5 Stars
B0083SBMBM|5.0|the movie was one of the best adventure hero movies in years. I highly recomend it. It was not a B movie.

B0065CCT6U|5.0|This man is amazing, with a beautiful voice, and face! I have not purchased the whole cd, but I did purchase 6 songs off of it so far, and this man's voice is beautiful, so powerful, I love it! He is simply one of the best vocalist in rock ever. He will go down in the history books, along with Eddie Vedder, Layne Staley, and many other great rock vocalists, who can sing on a wide range of style, not just one type of style. This is a must have album, or if not the whole album, at least 6 songs! :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well it wasn't bad it just didn't really catch my attention they should make a new one or n update of it.. I guess it's worth 4 stars
B005544TRQ|5.0|I would recommend this show. It is funny, yet serious at times. If you are a prime member this is a free show to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a really fun game that includes jumping over trains and onto trains and running away from a police man that is chasing you because you were spraypainting a train. you have to collect coins to get prizes and cool boards<br /><br />  -password

B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept you coming back for more.  She is a brilliant writer and can't wait to read more of her booka
B004UUKDNA|1.0|This bullgarbage doesn't need a track by track review, its GOD AWFUL MOLD. Pumped Up Kicks is the biggest smart mouth reason why this band is not good. The song talks about bullying and revenge in the wrong way and those people getting revenge should burn in a firepit where we roast marshmellows. Everyone who says that this song is inspiring and reaching out to the victims of the Columbine Massacre needs to get a life, get a soul, or just get knocked. This actually makes me want to murmur profanity at those people as well as reasons why they are flat-out WRONG at all costs. Pumped Up Kicks isnt 0/5. It's */5 because of how flipping terrible the duck vomit is. In fact, this whole album is that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how great the game is you get to care for a horse and it is so much fun I love how real it feels
B0026Q8EWW|2.0|You really can see how a actor has developed when you watch his early stuff.  I think I could do a better job at what he does.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Just purchased a Galaxy S4 and the Kindle app books are so much easier to read.  Thank you Kindle and Samsung!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game that other people love!<br />I got this app at amazon.com<br />Another game I got was dragonville
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I have never read the books that goes with this movie but I can say that the movie was great
B005544V6A|3.0|If you like flashy suits or thinking that your more special then you really are, this show is for you.  The pilot was good but didn't really live up to my expectations.  Only character with some depth and who is believable is Louis, the guy you love to hate.  Mike isn't believable as a real genius, Harvey is just a face with a few clever lines, this show wont last long if its not already cancelled.  I don't care for shows that have these really complicated problems/plots that are resolved by poor writing in order to meet the 30 minute time slot.  Yeah and the only reason people watch it is the same reason people watched entourage.  Sex appeal, a window into fictitious life style that we all wish we had.  I think time would be better spent watching PBS
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Movie concept is new and interesting, storyline is predictable. Fun to watch. Contains a little violence. Expected it to be better.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|You have to wait quite a bit but the aura to skip is fairly easy to get, fun to check in on it daily and upgrade until you have the best village around! More of a skill and strategy game.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game. It has 3 different modes. I've only been playing a couple of months but it seems as if the levels are unlimited. With other games I run out of levels after a while and get bored. I have yet to get bored with this game. It is so addictive.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I like that it is easy to use after you learn it. I didn't like that it needs WiFi in order to use since I wanted it for my 4 year old at times when we have to wait a long time- like at the doctor's office. And he is not able to use it completely without help since there is a good bit of reading at the beginning.
B005HSL626|3.0|This game is so much fun and addictive. I played so much I saw fruit in my dreams. I've had to uninstall the game 3 times because it stopped working. After the last time I removed from my device.
B003SI605K|5.0|An intricately woven story of mothers and daughters and how the culture of one affects the &#34;modern&#34; culture of the other.  Beautiful depiction of how one generation attempts to improve expectations and the spirit of the next, even when it's like pulling teeth.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is very fun and has levels from easy to difficult. I played often and ran out of levels in a few weeks. I wish more levels were included. You can purchase more levels if you like.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a real treat for those who love period drama.  Grand sets and costumes and a good storyline keep you interested, especially since we finally get the payoff of the wedding of Lady Mary and Matthew.  This season has the up and downs you expect from the world of the aristocracy upstairs and the help downstairs intertwining.
B000LJ9ZWE|2.0|Pretty outdated, not a whole lot of substance. Not worth it for the few minutes of enjoyment to be found.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book dragged and there is not much about the main characters.<br />I was disappointed but still give it three stars because the writing is still excellent.
1401307787|5.0|A secular, sane introduction to mindfulness. You can jump around the multiple essays, and just reading them helped me to feel more grounded and present in my life.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Crossfire series but was disappointed with the last book. Way to many sex scenes. Needed more plot development and suspense.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love all of Charlains books and my all time fav character is Quinn I was happy to see him briefly back this book made the series ending alot less painful for me I loved it so much and I LOVED how she ended it!!!! Don't hesitate If you like her other books you gotta read this one!
B008XG1X18|5.0|The downside of Pinterest: I'm addicted!<br />Crafts, recipies, fashion its in there.<br />Even when I'm not feeling so motivated, I<br />pin & save for later.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app has everything under the moon from recipes, latest fashion, holiday projects etc..my life will never be the same after this app!!! I LOVE IT!!!!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This was also a gift for my granddaughter.  She is very fond of Audrey Hepburn films and loves musicals.  I would highly recommend this film.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|If you like classic Boz you'll love this album. Boz's voice sounds great. Really love this album with a back drop of 12 great songs.
B000AP04NI|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughter.  It is an all-time favorite film and I would recommend it highly to anyone.
B007REV4T8|4.0|This was the first Bond where it showed him as getting older.<br /><br />We do not want an older Bond but one that lives forever. Other than that a great movie.<br /><br />Craig and Dench are outstanding
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Takes some getting used to but the game works great the graphics spectacular. Any fan of the iron man series would enjoy this app
B005LAII3A|4.0|Kate Beckinsdale made the movie for me.<br /><br />Not a remake of the Arnold movie but a movie that stands on it's own. Jessica Biel is good as always but Kate stold the movie.<br /><br />Buy this one just for Kate Beckinsdale it I spelled her name incorrectly it was an honest error.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I adore the way Khaled Hosseini write in picture words. He has an incredible talent , to bring the story into mind he is a visionary the way he captivates his audience. His perseptive on life is so grand, and he writes from his heart, Also I recommend Kite Runner That was awesome as well
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence shines in this movie she steals every scene. Not that Bradley Cooper does not also give an outstanding performance.<br /><br />This movie is worth adding to any collection. I enjoyed it as much as any new movie as I have seen lately
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I Love this show. It is fantastic and I can't wait for the next season. Does anyone know when it starts?
B009MF5BXK|4.0|This has enough old action stars in it to keep you entertained.<br /><br />Even Arnold, Chuck Norris and Bruce Willis add to the regular cast of the old action vets.<br /><br />I liked the film but someone in their 20's might not
B00AFEY354|1.0|This was aweful.  I didn't even watch the whole movie.<br />I pulled it from the player and tossed it into the circular file.<br /><br />Duckie
B009YQJ322|4.0|Good Action Film. I liked it but you have to be a fan of action films as I am to enjoy it.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|If you want something to play casually while you are talking with friends this is awesome. There is a strategy involved to know when to risk another role or stay with what you have. Try it out and enjoy.
B00005JMX6|4.0|It was a good movie for me dated a little but still a good movie.<br /><br />Might as well get a good old movie the price is right.
B0063IH60K|4.0|But it's not so great on my zeki. It's an Android tablet, and between the screen size, resolution, and app graphics, it's hard to see. Also, it does not always respond to touches. I should say I love it on am iPad.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Mila Kunis a talking teddy bear and a good effort from Mark Wahlberg.<br /><br />Get it you will like it in my opinion
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This movie was worth watching if only to see the cast from previous action packed movies all come together.  I think this is definitely more of a &#34;guy's flick&#34; but it was okay.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The case fits the Kindle perfectly as advertised.  The rotation is AWESOME and the self standing feature is way cool as well.  I highly recommend this if you plan on doing a lot of video watching and/or book reading.<br /><br />My only qualm is that I don't like the rubber band close.  I'd much prefer a magnetic strap.  The rubber band is annoying if you have headphones in and you try to close it (and you have to secure it closed otherwise the screen won't shut off.  Not a huge deal, but something that could be enhanced for sure.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Excellent film, very well acted, great story, well written and exciting. Having seen several times before and wanted for my collection.
B00BXLU1EU|2.0|but that doesn't mean it won't work for others...<br />I don't understant the need for a minimum word requiremement here!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|When I first heard Imagine Dragons album, it took me a little while to get used to their sound, but now I pretty much can't stop listening to their music. Radioactive, Demons, It's Time and Bleeding Out are my personal favorite tracks from the album, but each track is very unique and different from all the other's. In some ways it's like they tackled five different genres of music and made it work for the overall album. There were a few tracks that I didn't find quite as magnetically great as others, but I'm very happy I purchased this CD and I plan to play it frequently in the car (makes great traveling music).
0553382152|5.0|One of the best books/experiences of its kind. I have purchased many copies over the years to pass along to others. Highly recommended.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|This isn't my favorite album of theirs (Meteora is still, I think)... but there are certain tracks for this group that show they've still got it, like Lost in the Echo, Burn it Down, Castle of Glass and Powerless, which are my favorite tracks. Chester Bennington still shows his raw emotion (and raw voice) on a couple tracks, giving the trademark scream, but really I think my favorite thing about this album are some of the rhythms and synthesizer effects, which are definitely heightened throughout the album. While some tracks are lacking the energy and excitement compared to previous tracks on other albums, this album definitely has some great Stand Out tracks that made the album worth purchasing. It's definitely a Hard Rock album and very different from their past album, A Thousand Suns.
B008MVPA8G|5.0|The reference product in good quality, which meets the requirements requested at the time of order, purchase the above recommend.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is a great movie. Normally I don't like book-to-movie adaptations, but I thought this one was so well done, it practically surpassed the book. The young (and old) man that play the main character nailed the character so well and there is so much emotion in this movie, not to mention the visual spectacle of the film. The tiger alone is worth a viewing.  If you like survival stories, you might like this movie, but if you're looking for a SPIRITUAL movie, than this is the movie you need to see.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Kinda slow moving but I am to new to the game but fun so far. Going to try to get better
B00A83075M|5.0|When I was kid, I loved video games, especially Mario, Sonic, and all the other classics. While this movie is kid friendly, I think the best thing about it are all the different homages it pays to classic video games from the 70's through the 90's and still has the classic Disney ability to incorporate fun NEW characters (mainly, Ralph, Venelope, and the hilarious Jane Lynch as the Female Terminator). The video game &#34;sets&#34; are great and the script isn't too shabby either. The animation is great, too. Some scenes are packed with heart felt moments and even though some of the characters are &#34;2D&#34;, this movie certainly isn't. The voice casting is dead on, the plot was simple but enjoyable and for any Video Game fan, this is a Must See movie, for the nostalgic content alone.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I just started watching this series online and I LOVE it! So fun to watch on my computer from anywhere. I love my PRIME subscription - so many benefits :)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and kept my high hopes for this film down. Fortunately, I was not disappointed. The visual effects are great, and while they may not have quite the same WOW effect as LoTR did, it still adds to that same universe and is quite enjoyable. Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Ian Holm, Elijah Wood and Hugo Weaving all make great return performances and Martin Freeman is a welcome addition to the crew. The dwarves were all fun, except really only a few are highlighted (mainly Thorin, Balin and Bofur) and the rest are rarely seen or heard. Also, another great pro to this film is the MUSIC. Howard Shore strikes again with a wonderful, lush, score that really adds to the Hobbit as a movie.<br /><br />Personally I can't WAIT for Movie #2, purely for the animation and voice (Benedict Cumberbatch!) for SMAUG!
B009NY43NY|4.0|In case you were wondering, the Sookie Stackhouse books are light reading. That said, they are immensely fun, and the world that Charlaine Harris depicts in Bon Temps, LA, is one that you'll enjoy visiting.<br /><br />Dead Ever After has, to me, the perfect ending, and you'll have to read it to find out. This is great beach reading, though I am sorry it's the last one.
B005LJITS0|3.0|It was enjoyable and the CGI was good.  It would be neat if they have a sequel and it was in 3d
B00498YZH8|4.0|We watch movies.  A lot of them. We &#34;discovered&#34; Jennifer Lawrence in Hunger Games and thought she was a very talented actress. So we started watching some of her earlier movies.  They do not disappoint.  This story is very dramatic. The characters are realistic and the plot is very interesting.  I'm not giving it away here, so I encourage you to rent this and watch the movie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is a fun game to play.  It gets more difficult because there are more and more tiles to remove each round, but they aren't stacked very high
B00000IQW5|5.0|Holly Hunter, Richard Dreyfus and John Goodman - what a team they made in this film. It's a tear jerker but I love it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Im late to this awesome book but better late than never.  Read it!  Worth every penny.  At times I was laughing and at others I teared up.  Right on the money in almost every way!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty fun game. I wish that all animal games had this good of graphics. Love horse games and this is the best one I've found.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Did you say free?  When I saw this app I just had to download it. Keep it up with updates and thanks for the apps.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|In talking with my university professor friend, it seems that Dr. Alexander may have stretched some of his<br />'scientific proof' about baseline function of the cortex...But there is much that makes for interesting speculation about the after life.<br />I regret that I am cynical enough to wonder how much some of the contents was meant to sell books.  Sorry....
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved the whole series of books! Charlaine Harris' books are better than the series of True blood! Thanks for the great read!
B008WHTFL8|5.0|i have always loved 80's music and this band seems to be all about 80's butt rock. i love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awesome it is fun you get to fly fight creepers and stuff and it helps you with area and perimator it's a must have app
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|this movie was so funny. i had to watch it again before part 2 came out and i still laughed hard.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I watched it myself cause my son and husband was not interested in it. It is a very intense, sad movie... but well done.Sometimes it was hard to understand what they were singing for  certain accents, so subtitles are needed.Definitely would reccomend it mostly to adults.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Well written and clever. You will get sucked in pretty quick! Luckily there is only one season available right now.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Just find HQ videos on youtube and you can't go wrong with this. Take your favorite videos wherever you go! Simple as that
B005BDZQKU|5.0|Even though I already had this anniversary edition, I still had to rebuy it for the extras.  Glad I did.
1475143389|5.0|I purchased Mike's book recently, and I must say, he is one of the rare honest individuals who actually gives good tips for people to get good bodies. A lot of what he says in the book makes perfect sense, and it has worked out for me in practice. Although I've just recently started reading, I'm inspired to follow his tips and suggestions and feel that they will make a difference. If you are serious about working out and getting a good body, go for this book. I am glad I bought it. Great job Mike!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Gameloft has done it again! Blitz Brigade is a new multiplayer game that is extremely similar to the Team Fortress game series and is very fun and easy to learn, due to an excellent control system and a tutorial program called &quot;Training Missions&quot;. Like all Gameloft games, the game requires you to download extra memory from their servers that take up a lot of space, but it is well worth it in order to get this game. The only problem I can find with this app is the fact that it is almost impossible to connect to the Internet with it, and that sometimes the input boxes for your gamertag and gameloft login don't work. Other than those, it is very fun and I believe that you will enjoy it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Sad to see it all come to an end, but as per usual Charlaine Harris keeps you hooked until the very end....
B005LAJ16I|2.0|I compared this to MI 5 shown on PBS......it doesn't even come close ! I won't purchase the next season.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|This was the best movie I've watched in a long time. The plot kept me guessing and the characters really drove the theme. I loved it. This is the opposite of mindless action. This is how action/war movies should be made--suspense, tension, and emotional investment are key.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My boys are 12 and 15 and they both play this game. They laugh and strategize and have a great time. I rarely write reviews, but this is one game I can recommend wholeheartedly!!
B00336G7HI|5.0|This battery is just a good back up for extended shoots. If you will have a need for a good price on a battery this is a good company. I recommend saving money when you are on a budget.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|Stumbled across this movie at the library and recently checked it out. This movie was great with reliably good performances by Lane and Malcovich, the main actors. Also, the entire cast seemed well chosen with performances by other familiar actors with much smaller roles (e.g. Cromwell, Walsh, Baker, Thompson,etc.)<br /><br />Disney has a habit of sugarcoating biographies and history which is the reason why I struggle to give this movie five starts. I think there could have been a bit more of an edgier feel when it came to portraying the turbulence that Penny's marriage and family life endured as she devoted so much time to training a champion horse.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I would recommend this movie to others for viewing and I like that this was based on a true story.
B000001FOS|5.0|Yngwie Malmsteen suffered a nearly-fatal car accident at the same time he was making 1988's \\"Odyssey.\\" As such, it would be only instinctive to assume that the six-string virtuoso would never record again. But thinking this would be foolish, because rumors of Yngwie's death have been greatly exaggerated. He bounced back as lively as ever with this, his fourth-full length solo effort, making it a great album, and an ever greater comeback album. Twelve new songs are presented, here, and they are comprised of excellent riffing and memorable, fleet-fingered solos. And \\"Odyssey\\" is one of those types of records that you can listen to repeatedly and still find something new. But even if it isn't particularly innovative to that extent (as there are many other metal records out there that are like that), it is unique in the sense that Yngwie never plays the same solo twice. That's right; the word \\"repetitive\\" is one descriptor that cannot be used when describing this album. Some adjectives that CAN be used, however, include \\"meticulous,\\" \\"infectious,\\" \\"technically impressive,\\" and \\"shred-tastic.\\"<br /><br />And \\"Odyssey\\" might be first-and-foremost a showcase for the axeman's truly virtuosic talents, but the real heck of it all is that it also features some actual, honest-to-goodness good songwriting. There is enough hooks, nooks, and crannies, present throughout this fifty minute playing time to choke a horse. And it utilizes plenty of variety, as well, with the songs varying from full-on thrash and speed metal to Iron Maiden-approved power metal to Dream Theater-worthy progginess and power balladry. And some of the songs even verge on being glam, believe it or not.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Rising Force,\\" which might clock in at less than four-and-a-half minutes in length, but is nonetheless still a friggin' epic opener, and an instant classic to add to Yngwie's long line of amazing songs. It begins with a doomy, Japanese instrument-tinged intro before promptly locking into a thrashy, crunching groove where a propulsive and muscular -- yet always kind of harmonic -- guitar lead does battle against speedy keyboard runs and solos. And as a grand finale, the tune wraps up wit ha bunch of gorgeous guitar solos, including one breathtakingly mazy, sweep-picked solo. (Indeed, this soloing duel is truly dazzling -- so much so, in fact, that it rivals \\"Hangar 18\\"-era Megadeth!) \\"Hold On\\" is a solid follow-up, even if it is not quite as amazing as the above. It finds Joe Lynn Turner's falsetto vocals harmonizing nicely with melodic licks and riffs. The solos in this song, meanwhile, are usually melodic, but sometimes they are blazing and shred-tastic. But no matter which style they lean towards, they are always very fiery and impassioned. \\"Heaven Tonight\\" plays like a piece of traditional, cheesy hair metal, as it is complete with corny lyrics, and siren-like high-pitched, harmonized clean singing. It also features a grumbling bass bottom, a good, chunky, and aggressive main riff, and another fine batch of excellent, unorthodox, vertigo-inducing solos.<br /><br />Moving along, \\"Dreaming (Tell Me)\\" is a straight-up power ballad highlighted by a heavenly, flamenco-sounding acoustic guitar intro, which is then offset by a fairly deep and depressive bass groove, and augmented by a gorgeous, crystalline-sounding melodic solo section. But back on more predictable ground, the succeeding \\"Bite The Bullet\\" is again heavy, intense, and aggressive. In fact, it is actually a piece of full-on Eighties thrash metal. And it is highlighted by hefty drum beats (including a fast introductory drum solo), and crazy, head-spinning shred soloing. \\"Riot In The Dungeons,\\" then, continues in this same vein, as another up-tempo speed metal anthem with good, memorably chunky riffing, thudding drum fills, and amazing, out-of-this-world soloing. And so does \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu,\\" for that matter, as it begins with a thundering drum intro before latching onto ablood-pumping thrash groove with aggressive speed picking and deft, pounding skins. But the main highlight, here, is, again, the solos, as there are a ton of stellar (and sometimes \\"wah-wah\\"-drenched) solo flights to be had, here.<br /><br />\\"Crystal Ball\\" is a nearly five-minute-long power ballad with choral-sounding backing vocals that harmonize well with clean lead singing. And, of course, a ton of infectious hooks and glass-shattering solos are included, here, as well. \\"Now Is The Time\\" is another laid-back, bluesy, and melodic rocker. Its only heaviness (and, for that matter, propulsion) comes from its solos, which are positively blistering. But back on the heavy side of the line again, \\"Faster Than The Speed Of Light\\" is filled with deft, speed-punk-ish flavored drumming, and fiery, chugging thrash riffs, thus making this speedster evoke \\"Tooth And Nail\\"-era Dokken almost to the tee. And nearing the end, \\"Krakatau\\" is an instrumental piece that is stuffed to the gills with excellent riffing and miles of superb, mazy melodic soloing. It is also highlighted by a lightly-plucked string section, too. And the set closer, \\"Memories,\\" seemingly picks up where this song left off, as it is almost completely layered in one heavenly, angelic-sounding (and, therefore, ultra-memorable) acoustic guitar melody.<br /><br />\\"Odyssey\\" just might be Yngwie Malmsteen's magnum opus. If nothing else, then it is at least a shining example of just how wonderful the man's instrumental talents are. They really were amazing, and still are to this very day (even 25-plus years later). It is the kind of album one might want to put in a time capsule so that your kids can know what you listened to whenever you wanted a soundtrack for playing air-guitar.

B00A81MV3U|4.0|David O. Russell's comedy drama \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" starts with a Philadelphia mental health facility, from which a thirty-something former teacher Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) is now released. Determined to win back his wife Nikki who has run away, Pat agrees to be a dance partner of recently widowed Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), who promises him to deliver his message to Nikki. By the way, Tiffany has lost her job for having sex with everyone in the office.<br /><br />Not many people would think of making a romantic comedy involving two troubled souls, pro football betting and dancing competition. Based on a book by Matthew Quick, David O. Russell (director of \\"Three Kings\\" and a philosophical comedy \\"I Heart Huckabees\\") tactfully handles the subject matter that could be easily coarse and offensive.<br /><br />The greatest credit for making this tricky premise work goes to the actors. Bradley Cooper (Oscar nominated) and Jennifer Lawrence (who won Oscar) both deserve every accolade heaped on them, and so do the supporting actors, especially Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver (both nominated for Oscar) as Pat's concerned parents. When was the last time Robert De Niro was Oscar nominated? (Answer: \\"Cape Fear,\\" 1991.)<br /><br />The storyline itself is a little conventional in the second half, and some may want to see more of Chris Tucker, whose character seems underused. Perhaps the film is slightly overrated, but still \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is refreshing, edgy and entertaining and above all is a great love story.
B00AQA94M4|4.0|TOBIAS SAMMET HAS RELEASED YET ANOTHER METAL/ROCK OPERA TYPE OF ALBUM THAT TAKES YOU ON A JOURNEY THAT IS LIKE GOING THROUGH SPACE TO ANOTHER FRONTIER! THE MUSIC IS EPIC, MELODIC, AND ENCHANTING LIKE THE REST OF THEIR ALBUMS ARE. MICHAEL KISKE APPEARS AGAIN ALONG WITH LEGENDARY VOCALIST JOEY LYNN TURNER! ALSO BOB CATLEY AND CLOUDY YANG RE-APPEAR YET AGAIN TO LEND THEIR SUPPORT AMONG OTHERS. I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT I MISS JORN LANDE AS HE DOES NOT APPEAR ON THIS ALBUM. HE BROUGHT THAT DIO/COVERDALE STYLE VOCAL THAT MELDS WITH SAMMET'S VOICE PERFECTLY, BUT THIS ALBUM STILL ROCK'S AND SHINE'S IN IT'S OWN WAY AMONGST THE OTHER AVANTASIA ALBUMS. SO IF YOU LIKE MELODIC/FANTASY ROCK TYPE OF MUSIC THEN YOU ARE GONNA LOVE THIS!
B00127RAJY|5.0|She is tough, but it's a good tough.  Definitely not for beginners, but when you get there, it's great! It works!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A great explanation of what has happened to our culture over the last 100 years, with form now more important than substance.  Everyone  should be talking about this book!
B00571F26Y|5.0|It makes you think about how much wheat is in everything.  I haven't cut all wheat out yet, but am definitely going to give it a try.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome game, liked the graphics and the story line. Looking forward to playing further games! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys journies :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This YA book is a wonderful read!  The characters are richly drawn....I cared deeply what happened to them....and the story line is beautiful and uplifting....an absolutely fantastic book!  I was very sad when I got to the end....and I'll be re-reading it again soon.  I really miss the characters!  Their outlook on life...their insight...and their very sharp wit....all things I'll be missing!!  Can't recommend this book enough....it's very special indeed!
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|Good story  and hidden objects.  Paid for game instead of getting it free. Knew I would want to finish it after the free sample . So might as well get from the start.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie was shockingly bad. The writing was horrible and not believable. The characters didn't seem like real people at all. The opening scene was awkward and it went downhill from there.<br /><br />We actually stopped watching after about 30-40 minutes because it was a complete waste of time.<br /><br />This is the worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. I watched it because the trailer made it seem sophisticated and smart but it was an illusion.<br /><br />Don't waste your money, or your precious time, on this one.
B00991TCOG|4.0|It's a great CD with a nice collection of songs that are great for easy listening and aren't likely to offend anyone in your car. I have to say that the second track on the CD is really weak compared to the first track. Other than that I hesitate to think of any other flaws on the CD itself. The artist is obviously very talented. I'd love to purchase a CD of her violin playing without any electronic/techno/whatever accompaniment.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app is fun to play. It even guesses correctly on ones you would never think it would. I have yet to stump it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one book that I really did not fully get the plot or the story line until well into the book.  Very well written with an intriguing twist.
0061906220|5.0|I got this book cause my son loves it. I like that there is a free song and reading of the story too. I will get more pete the cat books.
B0009P66TK|5.0|I love this so much and is good for both smart and casual would recommend to any watch lover to buy one
1439153663|5.0|I have read this book twice and loaned it out to friends. What a wonderful<br />book. Everyone that has read it once will read it twice.
B0054N73EY|3.0|I am not a RHCP hater, as a matter of fact I am a devoted fan. I was also a very big fan of John Frusciante. As disappointed I was in his departure, I think he left at the right time. With the help of John and Rick Ruben's influence, when John returned to RHCP they were able to tap into a softer and prettier side of the band, starting with Californication. All that means is that instead of the band doing the same funk, aggro, rap rock, it flipped the script and made some very Beatles/Beach Boys esque records. The problem is that there is a fine line between making beautiful soaring harmonies, and going into just straight poppy crap. Stadium Arcadium had some amazing songs that couldve been on By the Way, which is melodically a perfect California beach record, but SA it also had a lot of filler crap and a double album wasnt necessary. I can only guess that John, the musical genius that he is, said to these guys \\"okay, we did some pretty Beach Boys Pet Sounds stuff, lets flip it again\\"...and their reply was \\"Um no, we want to continue to sing about Maggie Mae, and Sally Sue, and Dani California, and Susie has a baby\\". Im sorry, but the creative juices are just not flowing for this band at the moment. I cant even blame Josh Klinghoffer, who came on board, and is a skilled guitarist, and just doing his best. Anthony and Flea are obviously very talented, but I feel like they are just playing in their comfort zone at this point. They could turn this around. But John was such a tremendous creative influence, way way beyond his guitar playing, that I have a hard time honestly believing it can be better without him. He was instrumental in the writing, engineering, mastering, song and album direction, the list goes on and on. Time will tell the future of this band. The new album I'm With You has one good song in my opinion which is Brendans Death Song, which just goes to show you that if you draw your emotions from a sincere place (their friend passing away), the music can still be beautiful without John.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Though some of the characters were a little stereotyped, I enjoyed this book.  Helped me picture the structure of the kitchen and big house.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|You can spend a small fortune on the cool looking brands.  Don't bother. The professionals use Sony MDR7506 for a reason. These headphones rock.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Lovely for young teens to adults<br />Very easy read something very different intriguing ing and simple unique characters haven't come across a story like this well done
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|If your looking for headline news this is an app you will like.  It's free so load it and try it out.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is a great book for those of you who wish to improve your relationships and will help you persue new ones with confidence once you start applying the Four Agreements. I highly recommend this book.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is great.  I love that it connects you fast and you can  start tweeting fast.  Load it you will love it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|The site allows me to communicate with numerous parties. Sometimes I like to write to a specific person and not post it on facebook for everyone in my circle of friends. and it helps keep a LOT of spam off facebook.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Excellent could not put down. The ending had a twist to it that was not expected. A definite worthwhile read
B005DC68NI|4.0|I recommend this book for anyone who needs a good general overview of self publishing. It's presented in a way that makes sense and is very helpful. I'm looking forward to diving into the next book, Let's Get Visable[[ASIN:B00CPQ6YYI Let's Get Visible: How To Get Noticed And Sell More Books (Let's Get Publishing)]], for a more detailed and advanced view on what the steps are for someone who is already familiar with the basics. If you are considering self publishing and want to know most of what you are getting into (pros and cons), check out this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a good game so far but ... we'll so how it goes askes for a reveiw to early but
B00785P2QC|4.0|a very good game to play. fun for ppl of all ages. from one to ten. a very very very fun game
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Hilarious (sorta sequel) to Knocked Up. Lots of F bombs and honesty when it comes to kids, marriage, and becoming middle aged!! We thought it was well worth the rental fee!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|its fantastically enjoying it really keeps you guessing and can hardly wait to get to the next level I hope they do another game like this one
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is probably the most helpful tool I have used for my fitness! Any changes, additions, motivation I need to give myself, I put it on here and can access it everywhere! I even got my boss to start using it to help manage stock and repairs of numerous locations. Super helpful when you get crafty on how many ways you can use it.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Great movie showing the mental issue of bi-polar. The characters play an excellent part in the dysfunction of the disease and how it affects the family. If you are not family with bi-polar symptoms some parts of the movie may be a little hard to follow. Otherwise a great movie addressing mental issue concerns.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game has great graphics and keeps you busy for hours. It's interesting enough for older people to play as well as kids. Rewards are easy to earn as well!
1469220725|5.0|Wow what can I say about this book it is again fantastic.  I have bought this on audio book and it is again just like the other 2 a must read.  Gideon and Ava are finding their way in the world and making it work.  I love them both and cant wait to find out what happens in the next book.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I was admittedly a little worried as I first listened to \\"13\\": I thought the first track (\\"End of the Beginning\\")was relatively bland and left me feeling a bit discouraged. I was afraid that maybe I set my expectations a little too high. Fortunately, the fathers of heavy metal were able to set my worries at ease with the remainder of the album. \\"13\\" is an excellent slab of master musicianship that will win over old fans and young, alike.<br /><br />Personally, I think the album comes alive with track 2 (\\"God Is Dead?\\"). An 8 minute instant classic that begins slow and durgy and about 3/4 into it changes up in typical Sabbath fashion. From that moment on, \\"13\\" never lets up.<br /><br />Track 3 (\\"Loner\\") is my favorite. If anyone ever had a doubt that these old school rockers had anything left in the tank, just play this track. These guys are the fathers of heavy metal for a reason, folks. \\"Loner\\" contains two amazing guitar solos, the second one even better than the first. This song deserves to be cranked up loud.<br /><br />Track 4 (\\"Zeitgeist\\") is a classy slice of old school psychedelica and will undoubtedly be compared to \\"Planet Caravan.\\" Ends on another amazing (albeit short) guitar solo.<br /><br />Track 5 (\\"Age of Reason\\") is a contender for second favorite. What really stands out on this track is the last 2 1/2 minutes, which is all instrumental and includes a nice epic-length guitar solo. Listen carefully about half way through for the background choir that accompanies the solo beautifully. A terrific track.<br /><br />The spectacular \\"Damaged Soul\\" is sludgy, bluesy and has a great harmonica / lead guitar accompanyment throughout. Finally, the album closes on the terrific \\"Dear Father,\\" a horror story of sorts about a pedophile priest about to meet his maker.<br /><br />The album contains plenty of change ups, terrific vocals and Tony Iommi solos that will have listeners jamming their air guitars from beginning to end. Is it their greatest album to date? No. That honor will probably always go to \\"Paranoid.\\" Still, once beyond the opening track, \\"13\\" is a terrific album. It has an early Sabbath vibe to it- fitting nicely somewhere between \\"Master of Reality,\\" and \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.\\" Any metal fan should be proud to add this to their collection.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this first thing the morning over coffee and while waiting for the wife at the store or late at night just before bedtime
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Only halfway threw this season.  Looks good so far.  Like season 6.  And is nice to have an Arch enemy now and then hehe.
B002VFS6DA|5.0|the original was ok, never thought that they would be able to top it. they did. this one has better animation design and the story is great. a classic tell of good and evil. ill let you watch it. ill just recommended it. ;)
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Interest turn out on this batman series. Not at all normal as what I am used to seeing.  Kind of a good idea to a batman that is getting old in age.
6305428387|5.0|if you havnt seen this then you dont know disney. this is a great story of dreams and how you should strive for it,
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|A quick response game with pretty and clear graphics. Easy to play but the difficulty is enough to keep you interested. Overall a good match 3 game.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|We know it is a great story with Baby and Johnny. It is the supporting cast that makes it a classic movie. As an unknown cast of characters to movie audiences, these N.Y. stage actors well known to theater goers fill in the background superbly. And the music is the sound of my teen years. I play the movie in the background while working just to hear the sound track. Always worth another viewing.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|A very lightweight piece of filmmaking relative to Woody Allen's best.  The music, with the exception of the opening piece, Si tu vois<br />ma mere..., is not especially impressive.  Frothy but okay for a one time viewing.
B00008G7UF|4.0|Jean Reno is back to steal another show. While Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are good together, especially the later portion of the movie, their brief interaction with Reno is special. His subsequent role in The DaVinci Code is memorable.
B001QJUX24|5.0|THE MOST OUTSTANDING MOVIE EVER MADE.  I AM 88 AND HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE AT LEAST FIFTEEN  TIMES.  JUST PURCHASED IT SO I CAN INTRODUCE A YOUNG GENERATION TO THE GREAT FILM.  SORRY FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY WHO DO NOT HAVE SUCH MOVIES.
B0094K20FK|5.0|Need to watch with Into Darkness so you will understand the brilliant mind of JJ Abrams. Or his way of going back and changing alternate universe.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I really like this app.  I bought it for my smart phone  and now I have it for the Kindle.  The Merriam-Webster Dictionary app can be used with or without Wi-Fi which is extremely important to me because I am not always around a hot spot.  I found the Dictionary very easy to use and the vocabulary of words is quite extensive.  An extra plus for me is that the dictionary app does not freeze.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Certainly the best of the first three seasons.  Plenty of humor and suspense mixed in harmony.  Looking forward to #4.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Gives entertaining insights into the role of a sniper and the war.  Such a shame Chris' life and work ended too early.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Sylvia Day really screwed us on this.  The Crossfire Series is great, but it was supposed to be a TRILOGY!!!!  I was ready to know get to the end...I waited over a year for this book find out at the end that there will be a NEXT BOOK...in who knows how long -- another year or more!!!!  I was just so mad that she would do this to her readers!!!!  The story of Eva and Gideon is a really good one that I was enjoying, until the end.  Who knows how many books SD will stretch this ending out thru????<br /><br />Hey -- if ELJames and do 50 Shades in 3 books, SD should be able to do hers in 3 books!!!! Way to go ELJ;  bad on you SD!!!<br /><br />Very Disappointed in this ending -- or rather lack of an ending!!!!

B008BM9L72|5.0|I fell in love with Christian grey I cryed for what he went through and for how much love he gave
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I didn't care for this mouse. I see a lot of positive reviews, so maybe I got a defective one. The sensitivity seems to change on it's own and I could never get it dialed into the right sensitivity for gaming. I putzed around with it long enough that I didn't bother to return it. I'll use it as a back up.<br /><br />Updated comment: Anker noted my review and quickly contacted me. They sent me a new mouse and took the old one back with no charges. They were very gracious and perhaps one of the most responsive companies I have ever dealt with and you don't find that very often. I was very impressed with their customer service. I wasn't able to get the mouse to work in BF3 the way I like it, but that might just be me. As I said earlier, there are a lot of favorable reviews.
B00866H7SS|5.0|feel deeply and madly in love with Gideon that man is more than fantasies his everything his love knows no bounds
B009X011UQ|3.0|Marware Microshell standing case for the Kindle Fire HD was a little disappointing. I didn't like than you can't lock it, it just flaps back and forth. I am using it for my kindle to keep it from getting scratched. I don't know that I would recommend it.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|such a beautiful love so real no smooth relationship but so much passion and pain Gideon is every womans dream
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I got this app because I love this kind of game and I love Epic the movie. It is really fun to play. I have gotten addicted to it.
B00A4YZWN2|3.0|It was good  but I expected more of the series. The first book had such amazing promise, but I felt the resolution was lacking. I loved the first book though and I'm looking forward to seeing what the TV show does with it. Very well written.
1400069289|5.0|THis was a great book for anyone trying to be in business of any kind! As a college student I think it should be required before graduating.

B007TTFXC0|5.0|LOVE so many of the tracks on here! All of her music is great, but this album is my favorite.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a delightful television series.It covers the Earl of Grantham and his family and servants.The show is rich with a variety of characters who both amuse and move the viewer.From the divinely hilarious Earl's mother(Maggie Smith) to the conniving homosexual footman the.show is full of wonderful  characters , both upstairs and down who reflect England before,during and after World War I.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I kept wondering where this book would go & then your left waiting for #4. I can't wait for the next book!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well where do I start oh yeah,minecraft-pocket edition is the best game I've seen and played cause:when u feel like building with unlimited creative  supplies u can.But the best part is survival mode because u can make a place to live so u won't be killed by creepers,zombies,skeleton archers,and the least one that can kill u the spider. You can make bone meal from the archers it grows any plant to full size. Plus u can collect 3 arrows from each skeleton archer u kill then if u kill 3 spiders u get 3 spider webs and then if u use wood to make planks u can use 2 planks to make probably 8 sticks then if u killed at least one skeleton archer then u get  3 arrows then u can use the 3 webs and 2 of the 8 sticks and bravo u got ure self a bow and arrow but u have to build a crafting box by using 4 planks to make it son u can make ure self armor or weapons because there to big to craft one without using it.<br />  A person who hopes u enjoy it,<br />  bwbw.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|its good I like it its fun its not my favorite app but its entertaining I play it a lot there's lots of options to choose from but you only get three colors of eye shadow two mascara options and four tubes of lipstick for glittery and nonglittery not very many dresses either but that's okay I wish everything was unlocked though because you only get to have the one girl named Jenny and not the other three girls unless you want to pay money that goes for jewelry clothes shoes makeup and hair things but its a good app I like it it could be better its not the best but I recommend you get it if you like the makeover games by 6677g Ltd then you will like this app its good but if you're looking for an app that has everything unlocked and you don't have to pay money for things you want like accessories and makeup and everything else unlocked then this is not the app for you but if you don't care then this is a really great app its awesome every girl who likes makeup and spas and clothing then you will abseloutly LOVE this app its really cool I have a lot of fun playing it great time waster but really fun makes time fly by I rate it five stars cause its really cool if you're a girl looking for a good app then get this great for all ages teenagers toddlers and tweens will love this app its lots of fun and a great app I love this app its really fun awesome and cool so have a great time playing it great graphics loads good on my kindle fire but does take a few minutes to download but that's okay because by the time you're done reading this review it should be done and ready to open up and play so have a great time and enjoy yourself
B001QVFDA4|1.0|I was looking for an action movie to watch, and the trailer promised lots of action.  Unfortunately, that promise was not only broken, but shattered.  The film is VERY British, with incomprehensible and incomplete plot lines, the acting is at best mediocre and the \\"comedy\\" relief was not funny.  The best part of the movie was Thandie Newton, cool, calm, collected, but with a VERY minor role.  I can never get that interminable two hours back, please do not waste your money
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Never realized Hitchcock's family life was so complicated. Gave me a look into a side of the man I never knew before.
B00B769XB8|4.0|As the synopsis states, this is a grown-up Hansel & Gretel. Having killed the witch who tried to eat them as children, the siblings begin making witch-hunting their job traveling from town to town ridding the land of the dark evil with considerable skill and clever gadgets. This steampunk, adult fairy tale is as dark and gruesome as it is smart and funny. Think Van Helsing meets Underworld.<br /><br />While the over-the-top violence was a bit much for my taste, it was rounded out by plenty of humor. And the though a bit predictable, the acting was solid. I especially loved Jeremy Renner's understated performance, as well as Famke Janssen's evil witch persona. This fun, action-packed adventure is packed with suspense, mystery, romance, and excitement. I like that the film doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's a mindless action flick with entertaining characters and a fresh take on a well-known fairy tale.<br /><br />Review previously posted at SciFiChick.<br /><br />Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack Includes:<br />Blu-ray<br />*  Feature film in high definition (Unrated version)<br />*  Reinventing Hansel & Gretel<br />*  The Witching Hours<br />*  Meet Edward the Troll<br /><br />DVD<br />*  Feature film in standard definition (Theatrical version)
B008VBYN80|3.0|Pretty cool to play the different modes. Keeps things interesting. The log in system needs some work though. Good job.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this ap on my phone and my laptop.  Since I am new to Bible Study, it makes looking up the verses a snap! I also like the different versions to compare how they read.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Fantastic!  The colors, the depth, the absolute playability.  So much can be said on this superb game.  All old AD&amp;D players should be saluting this one.  I am hooked...
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Well done and fantastic acting. Humor, love, sorrow and felt authentic in time. The story line was interesting and compelling to watch.  I was addicted!. Loved it!!
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|I've never been a fan of the original series, loved the movies, and so I'm watching the other series for the first time.  I really like Enterprise, the characters are fun, the episodes are exciting and varied.  Plus, you know, Porthos.<br /><br />They just did not need to add the electric guitar to the theme song this season.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book is an inspiration. It made me look at flower gifts in a very different way. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that is seemed to slow down at the end.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Wow is all I can say.  What a beautiful transfer from a wonderful Disney classic movie.  Disney studios consistently puts forth excellent HD transfers and Peter Pan sets the bar.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|What can I say?  Watching this movie just makes me happy.  It's really well written, the music is fantastic, and I'm really impressed by the talent displayed by the actors.  Watch this and you're guaranteed to smile!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has done it again.  A masterful rewriting of history in this tale of an enslaved man eventually exacting justice on those that beat and enslaved him.  The acting was amazing, surprisingly as I am not a Jamie Foxx fan.  The HD PQ and AQ is astonishing.  If you have a nice surround sound system like I do, you will reap the benefits with this movie.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I enjoyed Lady Antebellum's new album &#34;Golden&#34; very much and listen to it over and over again. For those that enjoy Lady A's music, this is a good album to buy.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Jurassic Park goes down in history as one of the classic movies we have grown to love over the years.  Scientifically, the premise might even occur at some point in time.  The real selling point of this though is the 3D.  It blows you through the roof, almost quite literally.  On a Panasonic 3D plasma television, it looks like you are in the park being chased by dinosaurs.  Totally worth it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use my Kindles all the time. Use the Kindle with Wispernet when I travel because I can download on the road. Love the fire because it is backlit so I can read at night without a lamp. Also have many games for me and of course my grandkids. The Kindle on my phone is nice when I'm stuck somewhere and can read for shorter periods of time. Samsung has a great screen. Amazon is great with apps and just about anything you could ever want.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|What an incredible HD transfer to blu ray.  This classic movie series comes to life for the first time on blu ray in stunning HD.  The films look like they were made with modern day technology.  Kudos to Francis Ford Copolla for writing and directing such great scripts and kudos to the studio for sinking so much time and money into a beautiful, well deserved transfer.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Best combination of action, adventure, sci-fi, drama and romance. I lool forward to seeing the next one. My kind of movie.
B001EN71HC|4.0|Mike Myers at the peak of his career made this hilarious british comedy spoof series of spy work.  All of the movies are laugh worthy and the HD transfer is respectable.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I can't believe an author would do this to loyal readers.  That was not a book, it was a chapter.  The story may continue but I will not be reading it.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|What a nice treat to see and hear in HD.  This is truly an inspirational adaption of the play to the big screen.  Despite Madonna's medicore acting ability, it's a musical and her stellar music career serves this movie well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Best ever needs a hint section in case you get stuck but super fun.  Need more rooms.  Also computer can give HELP but should be with game
B00A7ZWUJC|2.0|I have to say I am disappointed.  As a long time fan of Rihanna, it seems that she rushed to put a new album out in the height of her career instead of taking time to put forth a solid piece of work like its predessor.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I love this kit. I decided to invest another $8-10 compared to the smaller $15 kits from another brand. It's a great product. Used it to open my MacBook Pro without any hitches.<br /><br />Only advice is it'll be nicer with an included Nylon Spudger removal tool. Luckily I had one from a cell phone replacement kit from iFixit. Great stuff!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Taylor Swift has established herself as a respectable country artist and she has taken a foray into the pop world to much surprise.  This is a solid album with catchy tunes.  Are they the most maturely written songs, no... but who cares?  It's Taylor Swift.
098357670X|5.0|great stuff love this book it has ever thing I need to draw my characters in my book wow thanks
B009AMANH4|5.0|This movie is epic.  The story follows Lincoln during the days of the Emancipation Proclamation.  Daniel Day Lewis gives such a riveting, gut wrenching performance here and looks so much like Lincoln it's truly amazing.  This is a great movie with a beautiful picture in HD.
0780619951|5.0|wow what a movie shows great, no problems at all. wish they make a third movie when they come to dry land
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The book was well written.  Brings many items to play in one story.  Abuse takes many forms and disguises and can be addressed without turning people away from the story.
1592537251|5.0|like to draw and sketch stuff , this book is great for me to see how others work , the book is great
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My 5 year old grandson loved this truck. It is so well constructed and very impressive that all the parts move and work much like the real thing.  He plays with this trucks for hours everyday and wants to even take it when he goes to school. So well satisfied with this company's commitment to quality which is not the case many times these days.  Woo-Hoo!
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Just like his YouTube channel, J.D.'s book is a great resource for learning how to tie his style of fusion knots.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I really like the prime membership advantages.. the quality of the show and sound was good.. I will definitely watch more
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This book is amazing as well as the rest of the trilogy. It made me sad but also happy that I live in a world like this.
B00CVSMLXS|5.0|Love the modern take and setting on an old concept.<br />Actors chosen for the roles , spot on.<br />If you love the big apple ,you'll love this....
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The graphics and animation are beautiful and surprisingly realistic, the music is beautiful. I like the goals and the ease of earning money and algae over both short and long amounts of time. For those reviews complaining that you have to use real money to advance, just be patient! You earn 5 pearls for 5 consecutive daily logins, and you earn a pearl every 2 or 3 days from rare fish if you feed them algae. You can get rare fish from the rare plants that don't cost pearls. This app is so nicely done, I can't believe it's free. My only small complaint is that I sometimes have to wait to level up before getting more goals.
0859537978|5.0|I bought this for my grandson.  He loves books and he loves the wheels on the bus song. He sings along.  It is one of his favorites.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app. I normally sleep through alarms but find I wake up better since the program uses math to help me to wake up.  If I wanted to I can skip the math.  This program is easy to use and filled with lots of options on how to set the alarm clock. I use this app every day.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game! lots of interacting. a little confusing at first since there are lots if rules you have to follow in order to di certain things.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great novel as well as a fast read. I would recommend this book to anyone! Very well written, thought provoking.
B004TI1WME|5.0|I love the Office Calculator pro and am enjoying using it whenever the need arises.  I use my Kindle Fire often so have this at my finger tips every day.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was so disappointing. I really enjoyed the first two books but this took a 180 in the direction of bad. First, I can't get over the fact that Gideon killed Nathan. I don't care why he did it or how much he loves Eva, that is just insane. I don't know about other women, but if someone killed someone and I knew about it, I wouldn't be able to live with myself, no matter how much I loved that person. And I don't understand why they \\"love\\" each other so much. We are just forced to believe they love each other even though they seem to have no chemistry  or nothing in common AT ALL outside of having constant sex. The Corinne/Deanna/Anne/insert a thousand other pointless characters here/ story line annoys me and seems to just be page fillers. As soon as I finished the book and got done saying \\"WHAT?!\\" I thought to myself that more than 75% of the book should have been tossed. This story definitely should have been wrapped up in the third book. There isn't any story left to tell.
1416909532|3.0|It was my first time ordering anything off amazon and I didn't know that this would be a daily inspirational type bokk rather than the actual book (which is what I wanted). I still am reading it but I wanted the actual book.
B009LHWEKW|4.0|season 8 seems closer to the orginal series begining.<br />There was a disconnect after the 4th season but I enjoyed the return to the supernatural style that<br />season 8th presents, will be back as a super fan again!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friend has minecraft pe on her I pod touch and she got the update on her game so when Is the kindle fire gonna get the update?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is great it lets me know how much I have. so when I click on this app I know when to charge and when to keep having fun
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it worth it, has a lot of fun I just love it so buy it now and open up a fun game!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat! Gillian is a great author, same good writing as in Gone Girl!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|dont work had to unistall conflits with regular you tube on my phone they need to work out the bugs
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is totally a &quot;cow clicker&quot; but so much fun with the ponyville story line. Everypony should play it!! It get slow after a while and the bits take a while to gather, but that's probably because they want you to buy more with money. Still it's a great game even if you don't want to purchase the extra stuff.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I expecially enjoy non-fiction movies.  This one I could relate to because my dog recently was killed.  It brought back good memories.  I would recommend this movie to anyone except those who are sensitive to an animal's death.
B00BESJYAY|1.0|This movie was awful.  The writing was bad. The movie was a bit too cheesy and Butler's acting was a bit too over the top.
B003WJ81MA|1.0|...it would have been merely terrible.<br /><br />Stilted acting, Kevin Costner-like line reading, artificial snow that looks every bit like a combination of cornstarch and styrofoam.  What's not to like?<br /><br />Fortunately, Scott, Cruise, et al became far better than this.<br /><br />If there were a rating of less than one star, I would have given it.  One of the worst I've ever seen.
B0061QD82E|1.0|There's no doubt that this is a very good movie for the entire family.<br /><br />If so, why would Disney prevent you from watching your digital movie on more than one monitor simultaneously?<br /><br />I have a dual monitor graphics card; at first I couldn't figure out why the Disney movies wouldn't play on any of my two monitors. Then one day, one of my monitors was not connected and I decided to watch a Disney Digital film and it played. Presto, I realized later on that when I have both monitors connected to my graphics card Disney has fixed so that you and I cannot watch the digital movie, we paid big bucks for, on two monitors at the same time via your computer. I have many other digital movies from Universal, Warner etc. and they all play whether or not I have one or two monitors plugged into my graphics card.<br /><br />So beware. If you have Disney digital movies on your computer and you have a dual-monitor graphics card and say one day you and your family decide to watch Snow White but you and your wife want to watch it in the bedroom and the kids in their room--forget it--it's not going to happen. Why did Disney do this? Control? They don't believe you own it?<br /><br />Whatever the reason, it's not good for business.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Acting was very good.<br /><br />Took a little to much from Blade Runner.<br /><br />Very enjoyable if you like unusual rather then mainstream movies.

B009O2XY12|3.0|This game was fun at first, but after you get to the higher levels it seems to be impossible to pass some of the levels. I would sit and strategise on how to pass them after trying several times. Then you run out of the energy power ups and have to wait to try it again. I gave up. Not the game for me.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My children love this game.  Takes a lot out of your battery usage. Keeps them busy and quiet when I need peace.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|One of the great 50s science fiction movies with very good actors. Beware the &#34;ID&#34;. It scared me the first time I saw it with my dad.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|Since i enjoy aviation in general  and love to fly, I got this for my great grand-children and they Love it as well. They have to fight their dads off it.
B004G0DN7W|2.0|Watch amoral Hollywood elites live out their fantasies - I think not. The only redeeming quality is watching technology turn on the Moabites.
B008KE3960|1.0|I like aviation games and thought this one would get my great grandsons interested in aircraft and space things. It seems to be slow and cumbersome it using it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|the past couple books I've been waiting for the end.  it just seem like it was starting to drag on a little bit. but I wasn't really impressed with how this book ended. I still feel like there were a lot of things just left up in the air, so I didn't get the closure I was looking for
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great graphica and shows exactly the state of the battery.  I am quite surprised at how often I look at it.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I used this movie to educate 10th graders about how slavery ended and the importance of the legal basis used in this movie.  Loved the characters that semed to bring this movie to life.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really didn't want to read this one as it was similar in story line to one I had just finished, but I still found this one very entertaining. You root for these lead characters even though they are always so damaged in all these young romantic novels.
0307887960|5.0|This book is amazing! it really works! We encourage everyone to at least try this out. It may impact your life forever!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Love Love this movie!  The characters, the music, everything about this movie was spot on. For those who love action/violence you will laugh out loud!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|super cool any one who says anything bad bout it is a liar its super awesome it keeps all ages intertwined for hours on the clock
B003YVCJQ0|4.0|I showed this to my teen kids who had not seen it before.  We all enjoyed it.  The action is fun, and Will Smith is funny.

0345525558|4.0|I began reading this book yesterday afternoon.  I finished it early this morning.  I could not put it down.  The book was so well written that I just had to know what would happen next.<br /><br />The main character, Victoria, turns 18 and ages out of the foster care system.  She has to figure out how to survive.  She is a person whom the flowers to best describe her would be thistle (misanthropy) and Oleander (beware).  She has worked for the last decade of her life to build a high wall around herself, refusing to let anyone in.  She understands and uses the language of flowers to communicate and describe how she sees the world around her.<br /><br />At one point Victoria convinces the local florist to give her a job.  It is through this job of working with flowers that her life begins to change.  She runs into someone from her past who understands the language of flowers just like she does.  The book then flips back and forth from telling Victoria telling the story as a young girl in a foster placement to present day life trying to make it in the adult world.<br /><br />Victoria's character is not a very likable person.  She makes some choices and does some things in this book that make the reader want to slap her.  However, the author did a good job of keeping the story realistic.  A perfect ending for this book would not have been ideal.  Nothing in Victoria's life had been perfect up to this point.  Why should everything come together for her in the end?<br /><br />The title of this review \\"Moss grows without roots...\\" has to do with maternal love.  Can someone give maternal love who never received it themselves?  This question is weaved in and out of this story.  I don't want to spoil anything so I can't go into detail.  You will have to read it for yourself.  This is a good summer read.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I like this series and appreciate NO interruptions. The more recent season is desire- when will it be available on Prime?
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|Despite all the hate, I found that After Earth is the only M. Night Shyamalan film since Signs to pack an emotional punch. 11% good reviews is harsh, as is comparing the film to the awful Battle Field Earth. I think critics just desperately wanted a film to call the worst of the year, so naturally, pick on M. Night Shayamalan. But I can say I think he's back on the right track.<br />  After Earth is a touching and actually well made movie. It's only the robotic acting \\"by Will Smith\\" that Shayamalan is known to get out of his actors and that he's in love with own dialogue, that gets in the way. Shayamalan's is at his best since Signs though and I like how Kitai (Jaden Smith) has a history with the dangerous alien species he's stuck on Earth with. I say, be open minded and form your own opinion about After Earth, it's really not horrible or even that bad.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game -makes me think! Good way to pass the time. Wish you didn't have to pay for extra hints. worth the purchase or better yet free!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|The first half of the movie dragged. It got better, though predictable. The end scenes were great. Bond is looking a little old.
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|Probably one of the best movies made about Vietnam.  Just the boot camp story of the first half of the movie makes this film a must see, but the rest of the movie is good too.
1781162646|4.0|This is a good book, I really enjoy Stephen King, because he develops good charachters and it it great storytelling.  This is a good summer book for sure.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I've been using this alarm for several months and I love it. It's easy to use, has some nice options, and functions as an actual bedside clock if you want to keep the display on. I'd like to be able to save different alarms - I don't think this is possible (?) but it's so easy to change it that it's no big deal.
0525951652|5.0|What a wonderful way to study history.  The story really gives insight into the many different reasons and ways different families emigrated to the U.S.  Couldn't put it down.  Even though I first bought the Kindle edition, I also bought the hard cover as I really want to add this trilogy to my library.

B000002J1Y|5.0|I had been, more-or-less, a passive Yes fan until  I heard &#34;Starship Trooper&#34; on Yessongs. I bought that album in what I believe was a vynil, double album format shortly thereeafter. After a house fire destroyed it, I bought a replacement on cassette. But years later, after dubbing the cassette to my computer's hard drive, the &#34;wow, flutter and hiss&#34; found on a cassette that old became very apparent. It was tolerable until I bought a couple of their remastered CDs. That's when I decided that my favorite album of theirs should be of better quality and bought Yessongs&#34; on CD. A very good decision that my ears truly appreciate!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like this game do to the realistic strategy of the game. I gave this game two thumbs up. If you choose to play this game, look me up to join forces.

B004EBZX6W|4.0|I like how this app is very easy to use and understand. It gives very accurate and clear information on what you need to know or just gee-wiz info. The graphs that are displayed are clean and organized and update frequently. The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is I like the app but it doesn't give any information as far as network traffic usage which I would like to see.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|In fact, I might be tempted to suggest that this band - if not The Who - represent the most overrated acts in rock history BASED ON MY EXPOSURE TO THEIR STUDIO WORK.  Good Heavens, imagine my suprise upon picking up the 2 CD set for 10$ and being transported to a level of high octane sublimation within the first few bars!  I'm a Dead fan, so I can appreciate the power of live performance, but honestly, this show is relatively recent - veritably DECADES after LZ's purported heyday - and yet still merits recognition as an historically magnificent demonstration of musical force and vitality (Jesus, and my generation worships flaccid wet noodles like Jay-Z, Kanye West, Mumford, and Vampire Wkend as pioneering musical artists?!).  My plea to the band is this:  Much like the Dead, and more recently, The Doors, the Airplane, and Hot Tuna, OPEN THE VAULT!  peace/katie
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire, the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy, is a very good book. I love all the new characters, especially Johanna Mason and Finnick Odair. It's really funny that Suzanne Collins makes you think that Johanna and Katniss don't get along, and then Johanna knocks her out to remove the tracker in her arm. It's great that Katniss discovers that she really does love Peeta, even though it took him being kidnapped by the Capitol for her to figure it out.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Each episode just kicks up the desire to see & learn more of these real-like characters.  So glad I have the series so I don't have to wait in between episodes.  However, it does distract me from some of my other obligations .... which ultimately get checked of the list anyway.
B001HN690O|5.0|Enough said.  It's really good.  Of course, I have three young boys, so consider the audience.  This movie is really great, and we can't wait until KFP #3 comes out!
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|We've heard it thousands of time this year \\"Its Black f88king Sabbath man!\\". This is exactly how Sabbath will make tons of money off stupid people. Like ketchup bottles in a cheap café the label is irrelevant. To pledge blind allegiance is beyond ridiculous. Taste it .. and be honest with yourself. That said I really wanted to like this album. I wanted this album to be good and would love to have been slayed by it. 13 is simply OK. Could be any number of \\"Black Sabbath\\" albums released over the years without Ozzy. The riffs are good the lyrics are fairly good and the sound quality all great. Yes its nice to hear Ozzy with Sabbath again. But this album has nothing special over the last several Black Sabbath albums previous. It has Ozzy back. That's the difference.<br /><br />Lets put it this way. Listening to this album while driving may be your danger of falling asleep. Throughout this record I could picture Ozzy, lyric sheet in one hand, calmly laying down his tracks between pill times. None of the old Sabbath craziness is present. Stuff like Black Sabbath Four which picked you up and held you there. The old Sabbath had an energy. The new Sabbath is tired, lagging and just plain boring.<br /><br />Sorry folks .... I don't care what is on the label. This is not a great album. Its not even good, merely OK.<br /><br />I don't know exactly what happened with Bill ward but lets face it. Even the icing on this product is rotten. Reunion? No its not. Bill Ward is alive, well and willing .. but $ got in the way. Wards drum style was a bsig part of the energy. The new guy is good but its just another \\"not really\\" Sabbath record like oh so many Iommi has put out. The new guy is swept under the rug like dog turd. All the promo material feature the 3 but drummer boy for hire is out of sight. That's gotta suck. You get to play with Black Sabbath but not really be a part of Black Sabbath. I don't even know his name. He's good and I feel for the guy. Watching the YouTube footageof recent live shows its apparent this debacle is a bust all around. Sabbath today is extremely boring to me. The legend lives but the people themselves can no longer live up to the legend.<br /><br />I am certain this album will sell and the tour tickets too. To fat fisted balding old men, the same ticket holders thinking Ace Frehley looks taller now.<br /><br />I peel the label off this ketchup and call it what it is; Catsup refill.
B000V7B90C|5.0|I just discovered AC/DC a couple of years ago and am now enjoying their music to the fullest (I'm 53).  This has music from both of AC/DC's vocalists so you can enjoy the style of each, which I do.  However, one should keep in mind that the quality of video from the seventies and eighties is not as smooth as that of the later years.  Like a lot of fans, I have some difficulty understanding what Brian is saying when he sings but that does not take away from the enjoyment of this video.  I would recommend it to all AC/DC fans.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is one of the best I've&acute;e ever played it grabs you with violence and get s you addicted to it by killing
B000VS6QTK|4.0|I really enjoyed this performance and so will any AC/DC fan.  I have yet to find a bad performance of AC/DC.  This DVD is well worth the price.
B000HZM4FW|4.0|Young, but exactly the same Nickolson, I enjoyed it anyway! The best is yet to come, Jack. &#34;3 more words required&#34;
B004QPOVE6|5.0|So far, this is their last tour.  I think this is one of their best performances to date.  AC/DC seems to just get better with age.  Any AC/DC fan will love this DVD.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Star Trek is always great for a Trekie, but this is a great interpretation of the original series.  Just saw the most recent movie following this movie and both give a great legacy to Gene Roddenberry.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<br />Fun I could play it all day it is sooooo addicting!! And easy once you get the hang of it!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Like a Clint Eastwood Spagetti Western with the same type of cheesy music and story line, but just plain fun.
B004V73FGE|3.0|I love this movie, but the sound quality was terrible with the streaming. I couldn't hear a thing. Haven't had this problem with other movies.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|As we all know, it is not very often that a sequel outdoes its predecessor. The Bourne franchise is not usually mentioned in this type of conversation, but Supremacy is a good example of it. Everything from the story, to the action, to the acting, to the intrigue, is kicked up a notch. The film brings Bourne into the proceedings while he is trying to enjoy an extended period of hiding with Marie from the agencies that are seeking to eliminate him. But, all good things must come to an end. Jason begins having terrible dreams, featuring quick bursts of scenes from his past, which of course he doesn't remember ever occurring. The CIA has found someone new to headline the tracking down of Bourne following Conklin's death in Identity. This is Pamela Landy, who is refreshingly all business, but very practical and rational. She is obviously the one best suited for the job, in that she can match anything Bourne can throw at them. But there is deadly intrigue in Landy's ranks also, in the form of Ward Abbott, Conklin's former boss. Since Conklin's death, he has seemingly thought it was all over because Bourne was dead or no longer a problem. Not so. Someone has framed two murders and the intentional botching of a CIA operation in Berlin on Bourne. He comes out of the shadows on a totally separate mission of vengeance, but before long, is drawn into an ever-so convoluted mission of clearing his name and figuring out how it all connects to his very first mission as an agent. As part of this, new -to-the-franchise director Paul Greengrass puts his own spin on the proceedings. His hyper-quick editing (especially during the action scenes) has been strongly criticized, but as I have mentioned before, I actually enjoy it. The editing gives the audience (and Bourne, presumably) the feeling of not knowing what's going on. Bourne is still suffering from amnesia, so he still doesn't really know where his training stems from. His reactions during such situations are only known to him, and we don't usually figure out what he's doing until it's already done. Bourne is not at all predictable or contrived as a character, which makes him so charismatic and easy to sympathize with. He doesn't truthfully know why or how he does what he does, he just does it. Therefore, during the action scenes, if one considers themselves a true fan, they must jump in and hang on for dear life. All the performances are terrific, with each one of the cast members getting at least one scene where they are allowed to shine. Supremacy is what results when we have seen Identity, and are therefore no longer needing introductions. We (somewhat) know who the characters are and what their involvement is in the story, and are now ready to get down to business. Supremacy is an amazing and ridiculously intense thriller, and I'm here to tell you - don't believe the detractors of the film or franchise until you watch it for yourself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and the fact they change the theme every month its awesome they put a lot of details that arce really cool
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Our scrabble group talks about the characters like they were people they knew and bets on what the plot line will evolve into.  Bought season 1 and 2 for my daughter, who for some reason, did not watch them.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I've been enjoying this game every time I play it.  Simple to play but difficult to master. Cute characters.  I recommend this game!
B005K17RU0|3.0|For free it's great. My biggest problem with this app it's not that reliable. It tells me it's raining and I look outside and the sun is shining but I get the same information on the news so I guess they use this app also.
B008I6ZX1E|3.0|The illustration implies that this set is the most recent edition, which it was not. What I received were indeed hardcover books (which I am pleased with), but they appeared to be a collection that was put together either from a series that were done at different times, maybe by different publishers. No two book cover illustrations are consistent with the most recent series. I realize that because the author publishes his works separated by many years that styles, and maybe publishers, change with the times. I found it misleading to show a graphic with the new book covers when that isn't what you actually receive.<br /><br />Although, I was wanting this set in hardback because I believe in the quality of the work on the pages; Just wish they had all 'looked' the same so I could proudly display them on my bookshelf as a 'set', like many of the other books I have.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome you should really get it.you may think that it is a wast of $7.00 but its not.so I hope your get it
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was afraid this book would be a disappointement, similarly to what happened to the last book of the 50 Shades Trilogy. I could not be more mistaken. The plot is very dynamic, the conversations between Gideon and Eva are smart and deep and the sex to die for. By the time I reached 60%, I wished I had just started because I did not want to end it. So worth the wait. This is maybe the best book out of the 3  books from the Crossfire series released so far. I can barely wait for #4!
B0044IABFS|4.0|The fourth season is definitely a new and different feel for the show. I still enjoyed it. All the other seasons are 5 stars. This one just feels like they didn't need all of the episodes.
B008O5NINY|2.0|The content in book format that I read some years ago was great.  The 2 stars is for this kindle version.  There are much clearly formatted versions out there.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|actors made the film happen. too much profanity for me. Thought the ending could of been better.<br />not enough suspense.
B002BPRZU0|5.0|I love this guys music, have seen him in person, and have quite a bit of his music, but in my estimation this is the best.  You will enjoy it from beginning to end.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The storyline is not the best, but the visuals are AWESOME!!!!!!!  If you do not have a 3D TV, at least watch this with Blue-ray.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game and my kids love the mystery boxes. Keeps them busy! I just wish we would have found this app sooner!
B004APVI1G|5.0|This is a good movie.  I really enjoyed it.  My niece loves it as well.  This movie is beautiful in 3D/Blue-ray.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters were very well written and I felt like I almost got to know them personally. I like a little romance in my books and this one had that as well as an interesting story line. Looking forward to reading the next one.
B008518MOW|5.0|I love the Men in Black movies.  The third one is just as good as the first one.  The third movie takes the series full circle.....you will shed a tear at the end.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I love Castle. The lead characters have great chemistry and the show has great plot lines. I have been a fan of Nathan Fillion since Firefly. A very underrated actor.
B00D2ZF24O|5.0|I don't understand people any more, if it isn't 24/7 action they aren't happy. This movie had all of it, good story and more than enough action. But to be fair I am a big fan of the whole Smith family. I love watching Will and his son Jaden together. I enjoyed this movie very much and it is what I call a pre-order keeper. Can't wait to own it my self.
B00BKRON5K|5.0|This book is wonderful. A little cheesy with many of the stories but it breaks down the idea behind the paleo lifestyle really well without going into the abyss of medical knowledge about nutrition, hormones and disease. I have been paleo for 3 weeks now and have felt amazing and am becoming a morning person of all things. I finally decided to make the switch to paleo after eating frozen dinners and fast food while living out of different military hotels for a year with little chance to prepare my own food due to a lack of supplies. I have never been overweight, but by eating more food while following the paleo approved list I have gone from 158 to 148 lbs already. I don't follow fad diets and paleo is definitely a lifestyle for me.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I liked  the twists and turns in this story. It truly reminds you to be present and thankful for all the blessings in my life!
B005JTAP4S|5.0|The magical and mysterious realms that you are taken to with Peter A Darkened Fairytale, are very creative and I really felt like I was a mouse in Peters pocket along for the adventure. This story with dark realms is so imaginative and full of non-stop action that I found myself on the edge of my seat and reading many parts out loud to my son, who wanted to know what happened with Peter and the scroll. This is his new summer read and William O'Brien is a great story teller to accomplish this. I recommend this book to everyone. With colorful characters such as fairies, elves, dragons, ghosts, and too many more to name, children of all ages will love the magical characters that come to life in surprising ways. I hope Peter has more adventures!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|After using FB on my Mac, iPad and iPhone, the Kindle download is not all that great!  Really don't recommend it for the Kindle.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I chose this book because I had never read anything like it before and I don't think I ever will. What made me like it so much is that it was detailed very well, every page made me feel like I was there with them. I would strongly recommend to any one.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Every day I get on this app, it keeps popping up with about 20 goals that I have already completed. It's super annoying. I love this game, but if you do not fix it, I will have to find a different game out there for me.
B002Q85A1I|5.0|woody allen does a great spoof of swan lake in without feathersbut this cddemonstrates the absolute beauty of the music too.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|This case has no opening for the power cord so that it can be charged with the cover closed. So I ended up putting the Kindle upside down in the case. Now that I have a stylus, it would really be nice to have a stylus holder instead of hooking the stylus on the strap.
B0086AYAQ6|3.0|Well, I liked the cd pretty well. Looked forward to leaning back, relaxing, and enjoying the music. Ended up a  little disappointed at the selection list - !8 songs comprising works from some five composers – all from the Romantic era (Beethoven classical and romantic era.) I’d have preferred maybe a couple of less Rachmaninoff and different Chopin . A bit more variety – other composers of the romantic persuasion  -  a Tchaikovsky or two thrown in (maybe one or two of his Seasons). Would’ve loved to hear a Ms. Lisitsa rendition of Gershwin’s I’ve Got Rhythm to slip in a bit of jazzy stuff.  Heaven forbid the selections include a Scott Joplin! How about some Gottschaulk (maybe his Grand Scherzo? ) I  would’ve replaced two of the three Chopin Nocturnes with an Etude and Polonaise. Needed more  variety. The pianist is skilled though. I thought too slow in a few areas, too fast in others, but just right in a lot. Taste remains to each his/her own I guess.  Loved the Liszt prelude (Un Sospiro). She plays it better than I ever did – not surprisingly. She played Liebestraum almost as well as my mother used to play it – and that’s saying a lot. But it’s a good cd – worth the cost – and as with most everything else in any market, possesses some room for improvement.  I'd recommend the cd as a listening and learning tool for all young pianists/ music students, and for enjoyment/appreciation by lovers of classical music. Ron Crooker
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game runs flawlessly. No annoying ads! The graphics are good. There's a good amount of layouts to choose from and timers for each one. Lots of fun, give it a try!
B004EC5IUW|4.0|I watched the Q (Japanese version) and that stimulated me to re-watch previous titles.<br />And I already had watched them in Japanese and their DVD is expensive, so my interest went to the English version.<br /><br />What I most like it about is the main concept of the series.<br />The story detail is complicated and difficult to understand perfectlly, but I love what they mean.<br /><br />If you don't get frustrated with unexplained situations, you will like it.<br />The series give you the highly sophisticated story, exciting actioins and heart-moving human drama!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It was a gift for my grandson and he enjoyed it. He said it was entertaining and was just like the real one.
B0030ZOYHC|3.0|I like the work itself, but the booklet wasn't brought with.<br /><br />The story summarize the early part of the TV series,<br />but that compresses the time to explain the situation, which ends up in a bit confusion.<br />No problem. You can spend time on watching it over and over again.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|He said it was a good and entertaining game and he has been playing it every chance he gets. I would recommend it to a young population.
B0000A7W14|5.0|The acting and the messages contained within the dialogue are equally fantastic.  Ice Cube even pulls off a pretty convincing performance along side the likes of Cuba Gooding and Lawrence Fishburn.  This is a must-see.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a fun game 2 play because it gets harder as u go up in the levels they also need 2 add it 2 facebook
B007BVOEPI|4.0|It was hard to follow the story in the beginning because there are too many characters.  I have to make diagrams to see who belongs to who.It takes a lot of patience to continue on but your patience will be rewarded down the line. The story came together for me at the end of the season. Now I'm hooked!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While this book took a long time to get into it was really good.  Captivating and really thoughtful in a way that makes you think harder about how fragile life really is.  I'm glad Katniss and Peers reunited.  I can only hope if a movie is made that it will bring correct memories of reading this book.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I didn't see this movie in the theater, but it looked amazing on my 3D TV. Very, very impressed with the effort they put into converting this to 3D. They made the 20 yr old, ahead of it's time, special effects look even more realistic. Take a risk, buy it. That's my recommendation. I have loved this movie since I was a little kid, so I'm a fan. ;-)
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Highly recommend to anyone who is a QT fan, may possibly be his best work. The movie itself is worth the puchase, looking forward to seeing all of the extras.
B00CS7ZXFK|5.0|Having been a BB fan for over 50 years, this is the best BB live album I've ever heard and owned.  I grew up in LA and as a young teenager, immediately got hooked on the BBs when Surfin' came out in '61.  It would be 4 more years unit I first saw the BBs live in 1965 at the Hollywood Bowl.  Of course they sounded great, but there wasn't an official concert recording to capture their sound which still sounded fresh.<br /><br />48 years later, this &#34;Live - The 50th Anniversary Tour&#34; comes close to recreating all of their greatest hits and album selections better than I had imagined.  I wasn't able to attend this tour, but what a tour it must have been, as the hits just keep on coming, usually its music and more music, with some minor banter and not a lot of chatter between songs making the listening experience similar to listening to a long mix of their greatest top 40 hits.<br /><br />Some of the songs, such as Don't Back Down, Why Do Fools Fall in Love, Wendy, etc.come as close to the originals in harmony and musicality that you can tell this was a concert experience that was taken to heart by the band and flawless song and recorded.  When you hear some of the original guitar solos, you can hear the impact David Marks contributed from his early days in the group.  I highly recommended this to any BB fan, past or present.
B0088RQ4TI|1.0|It would be cheap to say that this movie sucked, cheap but accurate.  Like a lot of high concept, big budget films someone forgot to put a story in.  At least a story that would somehow engage the viewer.  Looking for a film to watch with your kids?  Rent The Secret of Roan Inish instead.  Or rent both and compare and contrast the differences and wonder how many decent films could have been made with the John Carter budget.
B003U4UNPK|2.0|The director was on some crazy drugs. It could have been a great show but in the end there was know true direction.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Loved the series and hated it to end. Now we must wait until 2014 for the next season to begin taping.
B00CM1S1QK|5.0|Superb Sound! Sounds like RealGoneJazz might have gotten the remastered copies to rip. Here the breakdown:<br />DISC ONE - Tracks 1-12. Jazz As Played In An Exclusive Side Street Cafe (1959). Tracks 13-15 Nina & Friends. (Only includes the songs Nina sang lead vocals on). Pity, they could have fit the whole album on here. (1959)<br />DISC TWO - Tracks 1-12. Amazing Nina Simone (1959). Tracks 13-23. Nina At Town Hall (1959).<br />DISC THREE - Tracks 1-10. Forbidden Fruit (1960). Tracks 11-17 Nina At Newport (1960).<br />DISC FOUR - Tracks 1-8. Nina At The Village Gate (1962). Tracks 9-19 Nina Sings Ellington (1962).<br />Jazz As Played, Nina & Friends, Nina At Newport & Nina Sings Ellington are in stereo.<br />This one is gonna disappear like the other version. Grab a copy now. Put a little sugar in your bowl...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wish I could get more stuff without spending so much money on stuff like we shouldget more than 1 when we buy a hoverboard (e.t.c)
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I won't offer any spoilers, but I am extremely disappointed.  The ending was terrible.  Day is one of my fav authors, and I wanted to love this book, just couldn't.  This book falls very short of the prior books, and the story line was very repetitive leaving many loose ends.  Will I read the next books?  Yes...am I anticipating them like I have in the past...not at all!!
B00D8RYV52|5.0|My nephew loves this game And i love that he can be so creative. I am a huge fan of all the Dr Panda games
B004ELSDZK|4.0|This is a fun logic game that I installed on a whim to keep my daughters (12 and 7) entertained.  It's engaging enough that it keeps them occupied, but not something that they want to play all the time.  No problems on my Samsung G4.
B009NY43NY|1.0|After reading this series for so many years I am very annoyed with ms. Harris.  It was rushed and the ending was terrible.
0765342294|4.0|I bought the book after I heard the movie based on it is coming out this fall (fall 2013- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1731141/).  The book was gripping and didn't have any overly slow parts throughout.  It has a slight &#34;twist&#34; near the end that brings out other qualities of the characters, and I hope the producers of the movie don't gloss it over as being anti-climatic.<br /><br />The story is told all from the point of view of the protagonist, Ender Wiggins, a young child being trained for battle.  Though he is young, the characters are all treated with very grown-up situations and it doesn't feel like a &#34;kids story&#34; type plot.<br /><br />To Mr. Card, I wish I had read this book years ago.  For that I am sorry. :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I loooooove it!! I love how challenging it is!<br />best game ever! I really like playing it after homework to let my brain &quot;cool down.&quot;
B008KP6ENE|4.0|In a world where paper monsters are scaring your paper person, it's an easy enough game to learn.  It requires more dexterity than other games but the style of play is very reminiscent of the Mario games I grew up with.  My girls (12 and 6) like it for the engaging characters and scenery and were impressed when I made it further than they did.  (&#34;See, Mom!  My hours of playing video games paid off!&#34;)
0521189063|3.0|I was hoping that this book would be a good refresher of the grammar rules we learned (or were supposed to have learned) in grade school.  I was expecting for a solid review of parts of speech, punctuation rules, grammar rules, and for information like when to use neither/nor, when to use affect vs. effect, proper rules for commas, colons, and semi-colons.  I consider the examples I just mentioned to be intermediate; not the foundation of basic English, but a step up for some of the more subtle rules.  I found the workbook to be pretty basic...unless English is your second language.  I found that most lessons were related to verb tenses - past, present, future, etc.  I took the tests at the end of each chapter at the very beginning to see how much I already knew.  I aced it, only missing an occasional rule exception.  This book appears to be a great resource for someone needing help with verb-tenses, and especially helpful if English is not your native language.  If you have a fairly good understanding of high-school or college level English and need the next step up, this book is likely too basic for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game may not have all of the stuff that PC has, but it still is a good game.<br />There is only one thing wrong with it which is the fact that I can't update the game.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I saw Searching for Sugarman with my parents and then got Rodriguez's two CD's immediately after for my mom's birthday. The music is fantastic, she loved it, and we all enjoy listening to these great overlooked classics. An absolute best for fans of good music.

0316227706|5.0|I'm not going to lie.  I ordered two of these books because we had a session with Seth scheduled.  The book itself is awesome and provides entertainment for all our guests who look through it and it's extra special to us since Seth took the time to autograph it.  Can't wait to see his next one this Fall!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Plant Earth is our home and this series shows us our home like it has never been seen before. It shows us animal  species that have never appeared on TV before and enviroments that are seldom if ever shown.  The only real problem with this seriers is that it does not show us enough.  There is almost no coverage of the great number of species that cover the ocean floor(sea cucumbers, sponages, etc.) and the great number of insects that cover most land surfaces.  To me, the greatest series about the natural world was the first one that David Attenborough narated many years ago-Life on Earth.  This has never been released on DVD.  Still, Planet Earth is a great series and has my highest possible recommendation.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I guess I never really knew that much about Tesla except for some very basic knowledge. Was actually impressed by the amount of inventions and innovations he produced. The book certainly relates that he was not an ego maniac and therefore never as famous as some other inventors.

B009POCFTG|2.0|This film was a big disappointment. I was expecting a combination black comedy/film noir but what I got was a Texas trailer trash soap opera.  All the characters were over the top clichés with no sense of humor. There was not a single character in the film that I cared anything about. It was a 102 minute bore.
B009AMALLM|3.0|Paranormal Activity was a great film. One of my favorites for the horror genre, since it utilizes a style characterized as \\"found footage\\" shot by the characters in the film rather than a major studio, professional quality big budget horror flick. This was something I had not seen since the Blair Witch Project, and it's a style I love, since it actually gives a sense of not knowing what's going on, or what to expect, etc...<br />It tells of a couple living in Southern California, moving into a new house first thing in the film. They are Micah and Katie. Throughout the film they are haunted and terrorized by an unseen spirit/demon. In the end, only one of them ends up living, however possessed by the demon.<br /><br />The sequel, Paranormal Activity 2, tells of the events leading up to those of the first flick. This time it shows what happens with Katie's sister and her family, further detailing that a woman can make a bargain with the devil, or a demon or something, for the price of the first born son. In this movie, they have a new-born baby boy named Hunter, which is apparently the first male born on Katie's side of the family since the 1930's.<br /><br />Anyway, Paranormal Activity 3 shows what happened with Katie and her sister as children, which was briefly mentioned in the previous two flicks, however I'm mixed about it; When it was previously mentioned, it was described as they would be waken up and see a dark, shadowy figure in their bedroom at night, too terrified to move or do anything. However, this never happens in the third flick.<br /><br />Paranormal Activity 2 marked a direction in the series that I haven't quite enjoyed as much as the first flick. Rather than unseen horrors (spirit or demon or what ever), it now goes to \\"jump-out\\" horror, or rather, things jumping out or lunging towards the camera, in a cheap attempt to make the viewer jump out of their skin. This does work, but it's not quite the same as the first as I mentioned, which I enjoyed abit more since it was giving a lot more scares than the later flicks.<br /><br />The second flick still had unseen horrors, and in the third they were minimal, but showing signs of being on the way out of the franchise.<br /><br />Now we have Paranormal Activity 4. It continues the events from the first two flicks, 5 years after those events in fact, in which Katie and Hunter's whereabouts were still unknown. Now in Nevada, a family notice new neighbors move in across the street, a single mother and her young son.<br />Soon after the mother ends up having to go to the hospital, and her son is taken into care with the stories main family. And soon after that, strange things start to happen to the family, and a ghost-like figure starts appearing in the house under their Xbox's kinect, dark room effect or what ever.<br /><br />This film, was alright. It wasn't quite as good as the first two, but in my opinion it was a little better than the third flick. I liked the new family in Nevada, and finally seeing what happened after the events of the first two flicks, with Katie apparently raising Hunter as her own since kidnapping him as a baby, and raising him under creepy, demonic influence. Although there seems to be a bit of confusion or discrepancy in who Hunter is. At one point in the flick, the main family's young son, Wyatt, turns out that he was adopted into the family, and somewhere halfway through the film, he starts to claim that he is hunter, and that his old family named him that etc....<br /><br />So, did Katie give the baby up for adoption before the events of this film? I was believing that her son, who's name is Robbie in this flick, was Hunter all along, but now I don't know what's up, and nothing is ever revealed about who Hunter really is. Also interestingly, Robbie disappears later on in the film, where the main focus is now on Katie and Wyatt, and never again any mention of Robbie.<br /><br />Of course returning from the third film is the invisible/imaginary friend (or demon probably) Toby, which Katie or her sister was seeing and talking to throughout the third film. He makes a couple of brief appearances in the family's living room in the dark, though visible with their Xbox's kinect feature, which puts a bunch of dots all over the room for detection. This was an interesting and creepy thing, but again gone is the \\"unseen spirit/demon\\" that I liked from the first two films. It now has a name as of the third film, and NOW partially visible in the fourth.<br />Besides all of this, the teenage daughter of the family and her best friend set up cameras throughout their house, which is unknown to the mother and father, as well as Wyatt, since weird things start happening at night since Robbie came to stay with them while his mother is in the hospital.<br /><br />Anyway, as I've said, this one is an OK flick. Definitely not like the first one, but it does continue the story after the events of the first and second films in the franchise. I like the characters and location. And it is better than the third in my opinion.<br />I think my only gripe is that there's a scene missing from the home-DVD/Blu Ray releases. Of course an extended edition of the film is included in addition to the theatrical cut, and the Blu-Ray has even more footage not seen in any version of the flick.<br /><br />But the scene I'm referring to, which I heard about after seeing the film, apparently takes place in Mexico with a little store, and someone says that it's only the beginning. I never saw this flick when it was in theaters, so I'm not sure if it was a theater-exclusive or not....<br />I read that this is supposed to be shown post-credits. THIS DOES NOT EVER APPEAR ON THE DVD OR BLU-RAY FOR PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4!<br /><br />Well, in closing, I give it 3 our of 5 stars. It's ok, but not the best.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|My daughter loves all her wubbanubs. I bought 4, 'cause she doesn't accept any other pacifier. This one I bought as a gift. It's so cute and soft!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Works and can be used when tablet is flipped, unlike other calculator app I tried. Has a nag pop-up when first started but still good app.
B00ABO573A|2.0|slow starting and lacking in passion.  Music didn't help.  Just frames that seemed to absent continuity and storyline.  Not a favorite.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Took a little bit to get used to but otherwise it works well. Will continue to use it on my kindle.
B00821OX98|5.0|I want to watch season 2!!!! This was a really good show. I would recommend it for viewing!!! Great job!!!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Entertaining, plays good on kindle fire HD. Free version so it doesn't have many levels but still fun to play.
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|This won't be making it into my must-watch category any time soon. The story is funny and somewhat predictable. Nerds meet alien, government officials pursue alien, hijinks ensue. A bit like ALF on a roadtrip. Seth Rogen voices the alien and unfortunately in this case it's hard to match his voice to the look of the creature and it constantly breaks the suspension of disbelief. They may as well have used the actual Seth and painted him green, it would have been less distracting. There are some cool cameo appearances, Kristin Wiig, Jason Bateman, Sigourney Weaver, Bill Hader, etc. Looks like they had fun shooting it but it didn't really have many LOL moments. It was amusing and not a waste of time, but seeing it once is enough.<br /><br />PS - I read on IMDB that Bill Hader was originally cast as Paul - they should have stuck with their first choice probably.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Game plays very good on kindle fire HD. Levels are fun and challenging, even fun when played a second time.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|I'm not a huge Batman fan, but this is a really good take on a superhero movie. The whole series is pretty awesome and this is a good start to it. The only part that didn't feel quite right was the Scarecrow character. The terror just didn't translate. I know the guy was meant to be portrayed as an insane counselor, but he didn't feel that scary, even with the help of his &#34;treatments&#34;. Maybe if they would have shown more dastardly deeds or if he was physically more imposing. He just felt kinda wimpy as a super villain goes.<br /><br />Other than that the film was great. Great pacing, great back story, great character evolution and of course awesome gadgets.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very addicting, I can't get enough! Lucky for me I have all the seasons available and ready to watch on Prime. Interesting glimpse into the legal world.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This one went by too quick but the erotic love making was still just as thorough and intense as any Sylvia day novels.<br />Gideon is as romantic and strong as ever an he never ceases to amaze.<br />Eva has so many things to wrap her mind around I don't know how she can see straight...not to mention the mind blowing orgasms that are admitted to her.<br />Overall a great read and it leaves you hanging for way more to come. I'm punny.
