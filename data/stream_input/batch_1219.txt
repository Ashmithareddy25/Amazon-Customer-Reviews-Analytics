B004GYY714|3.0|The framework is great. I can browse channels by location, language and genre.  But a vast majority showed as &quot;not streamed&quot; or &ldquo;not compatible&quot;. this was a bummer.  The few channels that did play worked very well, and controls were easy.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|Excellent album. Great songs. Incredible musicianship. Very clean and tight. Best Anthrax ever? If not... it's damn close.  Welcome back Joey!
B005HG4C4C|4.0|Unlike Queensryche's new release this is not a major disappointment.  Although it's nothing new from them, their fans will still enjoy the new songs.  If you've enjoyed Dream Theater through they years you'll enjoy this one also.
B000069HZP|5.0|this movie was awesome... the first time i watched it it was just crazy... so much going on trying to figure out what the deal is with the game... and it just keeps playing you... i love it... too many movies are so easy to figure out now a days... but this one is definitely different i don't even really know how to explain or what to tell you but even after knowing the ending i still find myself caught up in the game every time i watch it... it's just too good

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Please Note: This is a Review of the original HBO series as they aired. Not the DVD product.  Well, after looking at the one star reviews to see what was going on, I have to say how much I disagree with anyone who gave this series three stars or fewer. (In my personal opinion).  Music   First of all, the opening sequence/titles music is absolutely beautiful. It instantly captures your attention and with a furious and dramatic sweeping of violins, instantly takes you to a faraway land. This music is used throughout the series, as well, though far more subtly. I happen to enjoy subtlety, and this series is full of it. Yes, some things are blatant, some things are irritatingly spelled out, but when introducing a fantasy or alien culture to an American viewer, sometimes that's necessary.  Scenery and Setting   While I enjoyed Lord of the Rings, I felt like some of the scenery and settings used in The Game of Thrones was better. King's Landing is especially immersive. In some places in Lord of the Rings, it was too obvious that computer graphics were used. Not the case in Game of Thrones. The Red Hall itself is amazingly detailed and yet well faded by distance in the few scenes where we see it thus. Even with actors in front of it. I'm sure it is a computer rendering, but it was amazingly well done. The Dathraki lands are immensely beautiful, and more believable than some of the realms of Middle Earth. Each of the kingdoms of the Seven Kingdoms has its own interesting land features. Whoever chose the shooting locations did amazingly well. Even the Wall is somewhat exciting to see as a computer rendering. It almost looks a little too fake and out of sync with the reality the show presents to us. But perhaps that is exactly what would happen in this world where the Wall was built by magic. The settings are also made more real to me because of the details we can see. The difference in dress between the Southern nobles, Riverlands nobles, Eastern nobles, and Northern nobles,is delightful to observe, as it places a very visual, very symbolic difference between the lands. This was captured also in Lord of the Rings, but perhaps not to the extent that it has been in Game of Thrones.  Character and Acting   These characters are anything but one-dimensional. If anything, they are more three-dimensional than the characters in Lord of the Rings. If I felt sad anywhere in the Game of Thrones, I know it was not because the film told me I was supposed to be sad. The emotions of the characters speak for themselves, but for the most part they are hidden well (as one might expect in a land of political intrigue where summers and winters last decades), except for the perceptive audience members who can see through the facades portrayed for us. As the series progresses, we learn what the Houses and individuals leading those Houses genuinely respect. We also learn that heroes are not necessarily heroes and villains are not necessarily villains. No \\"An agent of the enemy would seem fairer and feel fouler\\" here. You're caught in a web of complex morality, complex political issues, complex deceptions, and perhaps surprisingly complex sexuality. This is what really made the series significantly more tangible and real an experience for me.  Definitely worth a look if you have the opportunity. As for the price, well I don't have HBO. I had to watch the series online, but my family won't do that, so I'm looking forward to at least renting the DVDs and sharing the season with them.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A smart, funny and HONEST book. I couldn't have liked it more.    We've waited a long time to get a book this good that deals with what it's like to be an intelligent career woman. Not some silly glossed over version.    Deserves more than 5 stars!
B004WPYNY8|5.0|With all the negative reviews this album got I was expecting something terrible. Instead I was pleasantly surprised. It comes across flawlessly. Every song on here is a winner. If you want to here V or Twilight in Olympus then play those cd's. I've enjoyed every Symphony X cd and Iconoclast is no different. Outstanding production. I definitely prefer it over Paradise Lost. Along with Iced Earth Symphony X is perhaps one of the best 2 or 3 American metal bands today. Can't wait for Dystopia to come out by Iced Earth. Iconoclast is certainly in my top five albums of the year. And that means American or European metal.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|...artists often alter their works. Composers are famous for reworking unsuccessful material, or rewriting it to improve it (eg, Rachmaninov and Schumann). Writers rewrite books for any number of reasons -- 20 years after its first publication, Owen Wister edited \\"The Virginian\\" to reflect changed judgements of what was acceptable language.<br /><br />I have no objection to changes that improve a film technically, or add things that were not possible during the original production -- but I do object to changes that alter its substance, such as Han firing in defense, rather than (technically) murdering Greedo. I'm surprised that Lucas STILL hasn't fixed the Arabic numbers in Luke's scanner. Amazing.<br /><br />I have little to add to the comprehensive comments made by others, except to say that Episode IV has never looked so good. And I discovered that John Ratzenberger appears in Episode V. (He's the officer in gray behind Princess Leia.)<br /><br />Other than adding a scene in which Jar-Jar is slowly crushed by a steamroller with a spiked wheel, there is little that could be done to improve these films. Episodes III, IV, and V are worth repeated viewing, and justify the (discounted) purchase price.<br /><br />PS: I just watched Episode VI. It's better than I remembered -- the opening half hour is marvelously comic-booky, and a high point of the series -- and the Ewoks aren't /quite/ so annoying as I remembered. But they are a major irritation -- they look like what they are, dwarfs in Very Bad costumes (the fabric backing often wrinkles badly), and Lucas's desire to show a stone-age people defeating laser-armed soldiers makes no sense. I also noticed that the Emperor's contact lenses are badly misaligned; the seems to be looking in two directions at once. Perhaps George will fix /that/ in the 3D version.
B00198X0WW|5.0|[[ASIN:B00198X0WW The Mission [Blu-ray]]]  I saw this movie a long time ago and I was impressed at that time even thought, the copy of the movie wasn't good .I always wanted to see it again and that is why I bought this blu ray, the quality of this production is spectacular such as the scene of the people in the mission being received by the representative of the counsel and the wonderful music composed by Ennio Morricone is majestic, the photography is great.   The acting is great ,the differences between the two main characters played by Robert de Niro and Jeremy Irons were very well defined along the story and how one of them changed from a\\" conquistador\\" at the beginning of the movie who didn't have any pity for the Indians and his transformation after he killed his brother in a duel ,his repentance becoming a missioner who fought and gave his life to defend the mission and the Indians, along with the other character who defended the Indians without fighting because of his faith.  This is a powerful story from beginning to ending, how the Indians were mistreated until the most drastic and consequences, there almost annihilation  and how the missions gave them a better life consistent with Christians ideals and principles and how they defended the Indians and the mission until the end when the mission is destroyed  and Indians again are enslaved.
0891419063|5.0|This book, published 35 years after the end of WWII, should replace All Quiet on the Western Front as the ultimate anti-war - and horrors of war story.  It is more personal as it is real - it is more interesting as it is real - it also takes place in WWII - against the evils that percipitated that war not the power quests that seemed to get WWI going - so maybe it justifies war but it shows the suffering and sacrifices of those actually fighting.  An better moving read and more satisfying.  In paperback the photos and illustrations are better than on Kindle - I know as I read it on Kindle and bougth the paperback to give as a gift.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Now that I have waited 9 months since I placed my pre-order until it arrived, I can say I am nothing less than absolutely disappointed.  The name of this collection is \\"Original Theatrical Trilogy.\\"  \\"Original\\" means it was the version released in theaters in 1977, not 1998.  If I had known this was the Special Edition, I would never have bought it.  The name of this item is misleading, and should state somewhere in its description that this is the version over edited by George Lucas.

Yes, there's streaming. Honestly to tell you, the streaming was jumpy and had to pause a few times to buffer. My internet connection is great.   I will try iTunes now to watch the next episode and since they allow to download video purchases, it might turn out better.

0439796636|5.0|Michael Morpurgo's War Horse tells the story of a horse named Joey, who also serves as narrator. The story takes place during the First World War.  The beginning chapters describe Joey lovingly cared for by a fifteen year old farm boy named Albert.  The passages relate Joey' s interpretation of how hard life is on the farm and how different Albert treats him as opposed to Albert's father who at first is not pleased with the fact that Joey cannot perform the tasks required of a farm horse and the father grows impatient as a result.  But as time passes, Joey is trained and performs superbly. The father reluctantly accepts Joey and all seems to go well for a while until war is declared.<br /><br />The pressures of running the farm take a toll on Albert's father who is past fifty and resorts to drinking. He begins to argue with Albert about Joey eating too much and costing too much money to keep. The father however recognizes Joey as a strong disciplined horse and as the army is in need of good horses he eventually sells him to an army captain.<br />As Albert hears of Joey's departure, he vows that one day he will see his beloved horse again. All of this is told from the horse's perspective, including the bond that he has developed with Albert that must now be broken. Joey is abandoned and he knows it and describes it.<br /><br />The rest of the novel is a vivid description of Joey's experience as a war horse and of the various people and other horses he encounters along the way. The battle scenes are told simply and directly without being overbearing as Joey describes the tragedy unfolding around him. There is a lot of sentimentality in the book but that is to be expected. Some of the passages are very moving as Joey is transferred from one owner to another and has to leave his new friends be they man or beast or at times losing them violently in the course of battle.  The author does not restrain Joey as narrator and allows him to assume all the characteristics as if he were human and was able to express himself as such.  This aspect is what makes the story exceptional and a treat not just for children but adults as well.<br /><br />By the time I finished reading War Horse- I read the original 1982 edition from my local library that ends at 148 pages, I felt pleased that the prose sufficiently covered the years that Joey has been away from Albert during the war and closed the book well satisfied that I experience a great story of love and courage under extraordinary circumstances.<br /><br />Charles Blanchard<br />author of Mourning Doves After The Fireable to express himself as such.

1596434252|4.0|If you're used to books by the master paper engineers like Robert Sabuda, the pop-ups in this book won't wow you. They're above average, but not incredible. But the creativity and variety is very impressive, and overall I think kids would really like this book. What I appreciate is that the book does more than just pop-up. It has letters that \\"evolve\\" from E to F, or P to R, etc., in very creative ways. I would give it a 4.5/5 if Amazon allowed that.
0062060554|1.0|What a huge disappointment!!! It is not scary AT ALL, very redundant, and just gets more implausible with each page turned. As a famous line from Elaine in Seinfeld once went: \\"Just die already!\\" is all I kept hoping for so that this book would end and I could stop wasting my time.

B000CDIOYO|5.0|Bach's St. Matthew Passion is a transcendental work, firmly footed in the Baroque, but with substantial freedom of interpretation.  When performed by Mendelssohn 100 years later than its original debut, it generated substantial interest in Bach's larger works that exists to this day.  One can only surmise that Mendelssohn's approach was \\"Romantic\\" in the sense that he sought to evoke the emotion of the work while adhering to its Baroque origins.  And one can equally imagine the Romantic audience discovering Bach as never before.  Here was a Bach full of emotion, an intense and personal expression in music from a devout composer.  In my opinion, Richter approached the work in a similar manner, and it is both appropriate and triumphant.  Right from the beginning we are plunged into a world of deep emotion.  The opening chorus is sad, almost tragic, but also has incredible musical inventiveness.  Throughout the work there is a tonal overhang that never frees the listener from the intensity of the passion.  The \\"Erbarme Dich\\" is tears set to music, and other beautiful selections abound affirming the passion.  The tempo is broad, not in line with modern intepretations at all, and that is fine with me.  An example is chorus 63b, \\"Truly this was the son of God.\\"  As performed here, it will bring tears to your eyes; it is one minute of pure transport, a culimation of a declaration that defines the passion.  A more \\"accurate\\" interpretation rushes along; same notes but different effect.  We are not given the opportunity to \\"feel\\" the power of the declaration.  The forces are large.  We have a full orchestra, massive chroruses, and plenty of performers.  Peter Schreier is an outstanding Evangelist.  Ernst Gerold Schramm as Jesus has no peer.  Helen Donath's soprano is beautiful while contralto Julia Hamari brings deep emotion to her parts.  Walter Berry does not disappoint, but the secondary performers are of varied quality.  This is a two DVD set of performance recorded in 1971 so the video quality is limited.  The audio is of very good quality, albeit limited by the technology of the time.  I highly recommend the DVD.
B005GYRSAK|5.0|I enjoy this series very much.<br /><br />I have to say that aside from the interactions of Harvey, Mike and Donna, the scene where Mike checks out Amanda Crew's (truly nice) ass as she is helping him out was a very real moment that made me laugh the most this season.

B005COO1X6|4.0|Seriously, this was one of the scariest things I've read in a while. It plays on silly primal fears, but it tugs those strings damn well. The only complaint I'd have, echoing other reviews is that the ending feels incredibly abrupt, hand waved, and otherwise rushed. However, despite that, well worth it given how enjoyable it is up to that point.
0738711500|5.0|This deck is first of all absolutely stunning; the images are gorgeous and the symbolic meanings are waved into the cards both discreet and elegantly. Second; the accompanying book helps you approach tarot in the best matter possible. It also makes you learn there are no fast solutions when it comes to this topic. It has above all made me cherish this deck and brought my understanding about tarot to a whole new level.
B0052U59F4|3.0|Having heard everyone rave on the discussion boards about this book, I was really looking forward to an awesome possesive alpha male read.  After finishing it, I was left drained and somewhat annoyed. The heroine was unbelievable. She starts off super innocent then starts contemplating spanking and restraints. Why did she instantly fall in love? Why did he? The constant reference to her biting her lip drove me crazy! I love a good overbearing male, but the hero was just a freak. I realize he had a bad childhood, but it was just too much for me. I am not into the whole real pain aspect with sex. Light spanking is oK, not crying because it hurts. The whole book was sex scene after sex scene with pretty much just talks of sex in between. Since I'm not into bondage or pain, I wasn't thrilled. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because it held my attention, and I wanted to know how it ended. I don't think this is worth nearly $10, not by a long shot. Depending on your tastes, you may love this book as others have.  If you prefer alpha males that don't get off on the h's physical pain, skip this book.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|It recognizes practice allows the words I write very well almost seamless...  But it's to glitchy all the time on anything but testing the keyboard freaks out and I can't use the back space then spits 20,000 letter mostly in the web browser...  Sometimes while testing that alone makes me want to get rid of it. But it recognizes my words to well and I do not resize my texts so I debate which I should keep..  Most likely not this...  If glitch is fixed then this keyboard is perfect...
B005BQTUVI|3.0|I worked at the effects shop that built the big bug puppets and at one time had a copy of the pre-production script. It would have been a MUCH darker film. The \\"happy\\" ending was only that the two main leads survived (barely) their journey into the subway tunnels, but the bugs survive. Also, the autistic kid finds that he can use the clicking of the spoons to communicate with the bugs and when his grandfather finds him, he orders the bugs to tear his own sweet grandpa to shreds right in front of him! The kid is never mentioned in the script again. No magical autism cure, no childless couple finding love, no extermination of the roaches, just dark horror. So, I'm sure DelToro got to make this cut closer to his original vision but nowhere near what would have been an audacious first American horror film.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is fantastic. Definitely worth a dollar. Funny lovable little guy. Wanna hug him and feed him candy all day long.
B005PDJBRU|1.0|Stop trying to push the Blu-Rays on your customers, Amazon.com. Some of us are perfectly happy with the old format. And pushing something that the customers don't want to pay extra for is bad news for the distributor.   How many 3D movies are coming out now?
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I had forgotten how much fun it would be to watch this Hollywood classic again after so many years. It's beautifully produced and acted by it's cast ensemble. Can be a little silly at times but, what the heck, I had lots of fun throughout watching it.  Errol Flynn is in a fabulous athletic shape wearing his Robin Hood's tights and Miss De Havilland just looks gorgeous in technicolor.  The DVD itself is a very decent version of BluRay without many of the grainy artifacts I encountered on others BluRay's titles purchased recently.  So, if you just wanna have fun and be delighted with the extravagantly colorful scenery os Sherwood, the price is just right.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|Another fantastic read brought by Maggie Stiefvater. This book is even better than the first. I adore her writing. I will never get over the fact how much I love the amount of detail she puts when writing about the environment. So you can fully imagine the characters surroundings. This book had me turning page after page. I would always be like ok one more chapter, then another and then another. I fell in love with all the characters she brought to the story, Grace, Sam, Isabel, Cole, Beck & etc. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read & like this type of lore & romance.
B002RI9ZQ8|3.0|after reading the review concerning this book \\"the girl with the dragon tattoo\\" i will give it a miss. I get sucked into the media's reviews and too many \\"excellent reading\\" or \\"couldnt put it down\\" quotes and have become abit jaded[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Amazing way to end an amazing series. What can I say differently that I haven't said in other reviews. Her writing 100% beautiful. Tremendous detail with just about everything when it comes to the environment. Maggie really captures you & takes you into her story. She ended the book great & leaving an opened ending so you mind can decide what you think happened. I recommend this book to anyone! :) I can't wait for the movie. Let's hope they don't ruin it!
B005FNJL7K|4.0|From what I could hear of the brief audio samples here this could be a good recording. No problem with the brass!<br /><br />I'd love to see a performance of this music, especially if Shore was conducting. I may buy this disc anyway even though I have everyhing already recorded by Shore plus the whole cycle on Blu-Ray discs.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Personally I don't understand how the entire series can get any bad reviews. This book was fun, a great read, I loved the romance, the characters, and the action. I would recommend this book to anyone.  I would not compare it at all to Twilight. I know some people have. I love Twilight don't get me wrong but it's noting like that except for that fact that there is a teenage romance with a mythological creature. The author puts tremendous detail in her writing. Especially when it comes to the environment. There is no scene I can not imagine fully in my mind. She writes beautifully, what can I say?  So if you didn't enjoy this book then that's to bad but I'm sure most would. So I recommend this book 100%.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|This was a really good movie in my opinion. There was really never a dull moment. When there wasnt action, there was humor, when there wasnt humor, there were emotionally binding moments. Sometimes, they all happened together. Basically, this moment helps people to understand the back story that led to the formation of the X-Men and their rivals, led by Magneto. It shows the events that led to their divide and eventual warfare amongst themselves (mutants that is). The acting was spot on, and for me at least, i was left wanting more.<br />There is a funny cameo from Wolverine, but otherwise, the movie is left to fend for itself without Jackman anchoring it, and it works quite well.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0553801473|4.0|***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Alright, so most of us came into this book already knowing that we were going to be catching up on the characters we missed out on in A Feast For Crows.  It was a nice surprise to be treated with some brief continuations in the stories of Arya, Jaime, and the dreaded Cersei (the walk of shame was immensely satisfying).  I will say to have one measly chapter to continue Jaime's story was a tease and probably could have been omitted.  The Davos storyline was gripping, but about halfway through the book, we don't hear from him again, which is a disappointment.  I also hated witnessing Jorah wither into a pathetic shell of his former self.  Quentyn's story was interesting, but ultimately depressing and his journey proving to be nothing but folly.  Just when Bran finds the \\"three eyed crow\\" and finds his direction, we never hear from him again.<br /><br />I think GRRM wanted this book to set us all up for something huge.  It wasn't supposed to resolve issues, it was supposed to complicate them.  He was deliberately cruel in never finally uniting Tyrion and Daenerys.  Tyrion is my favorite character and having to read about the torture he endured on his way to finding Dany was tough.  Rather than come down on Ramsay Snow (I refuse to call him Bolton) with absolute fury, Stannis is instead slowed by a cruel autumn snow storm.  Daenerys STILL doesn't make it to Westeros and spends most of the book trying to make peace with Yunkai.  Jon Snow makes peace with the wildlings and takes them in as his own, struggles to save more wildings from Hardhome, only to have his entire course derailed by one letter that I believe is forged by Mance Rayder, in the process ticking off his sworn brothers.<br /><br />Yeah, that all sounds pretty negative and one would think that it was a very unenjoyable read, but it really wasn't!  GRRM is unique in his approach and the fact that he doesn't always have to end his installments with some major form of redemption for our favorite characters is a great thing in my eyes.  You come away from this  installment feeling empty, and unfulfilled. Angry, even.  But I think it's BRILLIANT because I believe that is what was intended.<br /><br />I feel like this book signals that we are in a transitional period and nowhere near the end.  When readers can come to grips with the fact that ADWD is the 2nd half of a bridge between ASOS and the upcoming The Winds of Winter, it makes complete sense.  I'm having a hard time understanding these terrible reviews.  Further proof that there is an overabundance of cyincs out there and they just expect way too much.<br /><br />This and A Feast For Crows sets us up for what should be one hell of a ride.  Will Brienne fulfill Catelyn's wish and kill Jaime?  Will Tyrion and Jorah convince the Second Sons to turn on the Yunkai'i and side again with Dany?  Will Qyburn's abomination, Ser Robert Strong, win Cersei the rule of King's Landing?  What role will Varys play since he returns with such a bang in the Epilogue?  Is Jon Snow dead or just inured?  If he is dead, will Melisandre bring him back Beric Dondarion-style? What will become of Bran as the next Greenseer?  Was the letter from Ramsay for real?  Will Theon find atonement?  What is Arya's role?  Will Littlefinger's plan to wed Sansa to the heir to the Vale prove meaningful?  Will Jon Connington take Storm's End and is this kid really Aegon?  If he is, will the bannermen of Westeros rally behind him to take down the Lannisters and Tyrells?  What will Daenerys do when she learns of Aegon?<br /><br />Come on, whether or not one thinks this was good as a stand alone novel (probably not), it was necessary.  In the saga as a whole, we needed AFFC and ADWD.  To me, it's akin to watching the clouds gather before the storm breaks loose.  From here on out, I expect a pretty wild ride.  Lightning, thunder, hail and a torrential downpour.  When it's all said and done, I think we'll all realize the the series couldn't have survived without this book.  The redemption will come, I guarantee it.  We just need to be patient and let this whole thing unfold.

0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper-Jodi Picoult,  Atria Books, 2004)<br />Finally! My first read by Jodi Picoult that truly moved me, and one that I would read over and over again.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper paints a picture of a family that is being devastated again and again by cancer, yet finds ways (usually unhealthy ones) to roll with the punches.<br /><br />Anna Fitzgerald was covceived as a genetic match for her sister Kate, who needed a blood transfusion from Anna's umbilical cord to beat the rare cancer she was diagnosed with. But it didn't stop there. As Kate grows up and relapses, her sister is called upon for transfusions and donations again and again until Anna decides to hire a lawyer to sue her parents to the rights to her own body.<br /><br />A wonderful commentary on ethics, a disease that never gives up, and how far one family will go to keep a daughter alive, My Sister's Keeper is a spot on look into the lives of an average american family, riddled by a horrific disease.<br /><br />Picoult gives backstory to the prideful lawyer, the mother giving everything she has, the father who hides in his work, the older son fighting for attention, and the sisters who have to choose to stay alive or truly live.<br /><br />Jodi's irony is evident and beautiful in this novel, and it is a must read. I recommend it 100%. My Sister's Keeper is a wonderful, challenging story, and truly a work of art.
B000002KM6|4.0|If FAIR WARNING were a Beatle, it would probably be considered a Ringo or a George. That is to say, it is not what most rock `n roll fans think of when the name \\"Van Halen\\" comes up in conversation, any more than Ringo or George are the first people you think of when somebody mentions the Beatles. The Paul and John albums, the ones everybody knows and loves and associates with the name in question, are VAN HALEN I and 1984. But just because casual rock `n roll fans can't name a single song off FAIR WARNING doesn't mean the album doesn't rock.<br /><br />Halen is generally thought of as a happy-go-lucky band - there's Dave doing a split, there's Eddie grinning goofily as he tucks his cigarette behind his guitar string and shreds a solo, there's Michael Anthony chugging Jack Daneil's. And let's face it, a band that produced songs like \\"Big Bad Bill\\", \\"Beautiful Girls\\", \\"Happy Trails\\", \\"Loss of Control\\", etc. was obviously as much out for getting laughs as head-banging and fist-pumping.  However, people who really listen to their music, all their music, know that these musical stooges had a dark, gritty side to their sound, one that is evident on every one of their albums, and which was intrinstic to the band's sound.<br /><br />FAIR WARNING is one of those albums that puts you on notice from the first track that it is out to create a certain mood, a certain atmosphere - an atmosphere not of rich rock gods driving Ferraris and living in mansions, but of  guys whose world was composed of broken pavements, malfunctioning amps, overflowing ashtrays, strip joints, fights in back alleys and sex in the back seats of cars. \\"Mean Streets\\" opening line (\\"At night I walk these stinkin' streets past the crazies on my block/And I see the same old faces and I hear that same old talk/We're searching for the latest thing a break in this routine/Talkin' some new kicks man ones like you ain't never seen\\") is the musical equivalent of pulp fiction or film noir. So is \\"Dirty Movies\\", a leering song about a porn star who \\"got the big deal in the back of a limo.\\" Likewise, \\"Sinner's Swing\\", with its ridiculously fast guitar, half-sinister lyrics and oddly beautiful refrains. Just when you think you've got the album figured, however, it downshifts into the beautiful opening melody of \\"Hear About It Later\\", which pops with the kind of cynical lyrics that only Dave could write, and boasts those lovely background vocals by Eddie & Michael which were an underappreciated but key element of Halen's old sound. After that come two terrific tracks, the tough but funny \\"Unchained\\" (\\"Come on Dave, gimme a break!\\") and the pantingly sexual \\"Push Come To Shove.\\" The album lightens up with the exuberant \\"So This Is Love?\\" and then saunters through the instrumental \\"Sunday Afternoon in the Park\\" before finishing on the same note it started, the brutally angry \\"One Foot Out The Door.\\"<br /><br />I'm no expert on the history of VH, but I do know that VH had a tough, brutal, exhausting fight in the mid-late 70s to conquer the SoCal club circuit and get signed by a label, and that they were living the classic life of struggling bands on the road: living in sleazy motels and crummy apartments, driving around back roads in cramped vans with bald tires, playing in dangerous bars, hustling malfunctioning equipment, hosting gigs where nobody showed up and nobody got paid, and basically living a life of brawls, bruises, broken glass and bad debts. The story Eddie (or maybe it was Dave) told in an interview, about sneaking around Hollywood in the middle of the night, plastering posters right over the hoardings that say \\"post no bills/will prosecute\\" and coming home with hands covered in glue, in the half-vain hopes of drawing a crowd to their earliest gigs, pretty much sums up the spirit of FAIR WARNING. So if you're looking for SoCal sunshine in your music, look elsewhere; this album is a walk through downtown Detroit.porn star who \\"got the big deal in the back of a limo.\\" Likewise, \\"Sinner's Swing\\", with its ridiculously fast guitar, half-sinister lyrics and oddly beautiful refrains.

These two books could change the world/nation/economy.  I am afraid what would happen if everyone read and followed the recommendations.  Possible changes would be: A collapse of the Medical profession; A collapse of the dairy industry; a collapse of the meat industry; A collapse of the Insurance industry; and a growth of farmers across the World.    I am afraid we would have to change the world again.[[ASIN:1932100660 The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health]]  Also: [[ASIN:1583333002 Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure]]

1400079144|3.0|I have been meaning to read this book since it was released. I am glad I was not hard on myself for not reading this book for so long. The book is mediocre at best. Was not very impressed with the plot. I have read all the books in the series and now the plot seems very predictable. I still liked Angels and Demons the most. The history lesson was good with all the symbolism etc. Seeing DC as a mystical city was refreshing. All in all, you will not be missing anything if you don't read this book.   Happy Reading!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I didn't think that I was gonna like the game as much as I do but the game is very addicting. Simple game, but it does make you think in the later stages, plus it appeals to peoples destructive nature (lol). Simple to learn gameplay, a little skill and a lot of luck makes it a fun game to play. Ads do sometimes get in the way of however so I can't give it a full 5 stars, but hey its free.
0393330435|5.0|This book was unexpectedly great. I really enjoyed listening to it. As en engineer I felt I could relate to Steve and he inspires to continually follow your passions. He reminds how to create something new, and how to design and build quality systems. Lastly it was very interesting to hear his version of the history of Apple and the development of the first home computer.  This book may not be for everyone, but if you can relate to 'nerd culture' then I think you would like it.

B000JPDJUY|4.0|S.W.A.T. is a 2003 movie that was upstaged by some megahits released at the same time: now that it is On Demand and on DVD it can be better appreciated for the tight little action film it is.  Though it still plays on the 'good cop/bad cop' concept,  the story and screenplay by Ron Mita,  Jim McClain, David Ayer and David McKenna  based on the television characters designed by Robert Hammer delivers a multilayered look at our police force primarily because it is played out by a strong cast of actors.<br /><br />As history to the current story is laid out, two Los Angeles S.W.A.T. officers Jim Street (Colin Farrell  and Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) had been assigned to stop a violent bank robbery and though they succeeded the unfortunately shot an innocent hostage during the gun fight; Street was suspended and the more violent Gamble was fired. Jump six months later and potential crime situations are so threatening that the veteran SWAT officer Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson) is assigned the task of assembling a top flight SWAT team to be trained: Obviously he recruits Street, Gamble as well as McCabe (Josh Charles), Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Deke Kay (LL Cool J).  It is the in and out play of these characters with their boss that adds the expected degree of levity that made the television series so popular. Once training is over the teams assignment is to squelch the prison escape of a French crime boss Alex Montell (Olivier Martinez) and it is this wrench of justice versus payola that divides the SWAT team and results in a chase that is high tension and surprising.<br /><br />Farrell and Renner are very well cast and are able to explore the permutations of their history versus the decisions that must be made in a situation that holds the possibility of becoming immediately wealthy versus carrying out their commitment to law enforcement with strong credibility. A great movie this is not, but a fine action and psychological thriller it is.  Grady Harp, September 11

B0013GH9AO|5.0|Literally, that is enough said. This album, like all Dre albums (oh yeah, there is only one other), is a classic West Coast rap album. Flawless production from start to finish, entertaining lyrics (do not look for inspired, socially-conscious lyrics), and 15+ tracks. Any hip-hop fan must have this album. If you are from Cali and you don't have this album, shame on you.
0439023491|2.0|Though I was a large fan of the first novel, I'm having trouble keeping interested in this one.  Though first-person present often seems like the best choice in immediacy and relatability, here it seems to fall flat as Katniss' mental stumbling fails to reveal much more of her personality.  That aside, I'll try to keep on reading, as I'm sure I'll like the adventurous plot.  However, I wish the book, if nothing else, was in 3rd person past tense.  This seems like a small issue, but with nothing particularly revealing going on in the protagonist's head, it seems to slow down the book.  When everyone shouts we hear nothing, and likewise when every moment struggles to be immediate, almost nothing feels that way.  With such a home-run on the world Collins created, I wish the writing packed more of a punch in delivering it.
B00026WU82|5.0|This album in its original LP form, changed the world of music. Like Beethoven did with his 3rd, 5th, 6th and 9th Symphonies, or Stravinsky did with Rites of Spring, or Chuck Berry or Ornette Coleman or Coltrane's Love Supreme did. Highway 61 Revisited brought modern poetry and politics and intelligence to Rock and Roll. If you've ever enjoyed 20th century poetry, or Jack Kerouac, or blues music, then just buy this CD.It not only explains the 1960's, it's the best the 60's had to offer. And this CD sounds really good too.

0553807919|5.0|As a child therapist I was thrilled to read this book; I am always on the lookout for new parenting strategies to share with the parents of my clients.  I was pleased to find that in addition to some simple, neurologically-based parenting strategies, there was also some fascinating information on brain development in children.    The book begins with the premise that everyday parenting dilemmas-- such as that fight in the backseat over who is on whose side-- can be turned into opportunities to teach kids important skills, like conflict resolution, perspective-taking, and empathy.  This is not an approach to parenting that expects perfection; there is lots of reassurance throughout the book that no parent is perfect, and that the authors don't expect parents to turn every moment into a magical lesson.  They simply provide strategies for parents to make the most of everyday moments in terms of helping their child's brain develop.  The authors come across as down-to-earth and friendly, yet extremely knowledgeable.    The book explores the differences between left and right brain, and \\"upstairs and downstairs\\" brain development in kids, providing wonderful insight-- in plain English-- on the neurological reasons why kids react and respond differently than adults.  Parents are shown how to engage with their children on an emotional level before attempting to reason with them.  Other strategies involve helping kids to strengthen their memories, improve their mindfulness skills, and manage strong emotions.    The book is filled with cartoons that illustrate the various parenting skills, as well as illustrations to explain some of the neurological concepts (which are much, much easier to understand with a visual).  There is a helpful refrigerator sheet that summarizes each of the skills learned in the book, as well as an \\"ages and stages\\" section at the end which illustrates how to apapt the skills to different developmental stages.   Overall this was an interesting, insightful book that explained how parents can engage the \\"whole brain\\" of the child to raise children that are thoughtful, empathetic, and emotionally intelligent.  I would highly recommend this book to parents, as well as to therapists who work with children.
B004QHU74M|5.0|J had been doing the acoustic thing, like Martin and Me, which was Dino Jr songs done acoustic, which might be the way they were originally written, who knows, besides J, Lou and Murph. But this is a wonderful display of his acoustic writing, and may be a group of songs he was not interested in beefing up and turning into Dino Jr songs. He takes advantage of the strengths of this style and incorporates some tight and strong harmonies, violin playing that makes it float and some tasteful Mascis type leads throughout, all non intrusive to J's voice and acoustic guitar. The lyrics are very typical J, and sometimes get a little repetitive, but everything flows so well it makes it unnoticeable (except maybe to someone like me who has listened to J or Dino everyday for the past 20 years). I love this album, especially on dark purple and black splatter wax! Thanks J!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I don't usually write reviews on Amazon. But because of all the one star reviews written by extremist fan boys, before this set even came out, I feel compelled to do so. I don't even know why these people call themselves Star Wars fans to begin with. Most of them only like the first two films. The don't like Jedi or the prequels. To me it's just crazy the way they act and I'm 39 and a life long Star Wars fan. I dare you to find anybody who likes these movies more than me. But I don't dress up like the characters or have rooms and rooms of merchandise. I just love the films.  To address the changes first for the Blu-rays, they're mostly minor tweaks. Hardly noticeable, except for the change of theYoda puppet in The Phantom Menace to a CGI character. But now he matches the Yoda from the other two prequels. Darth Vader's \\"No!\\" in the context of Jedi actually, to my surprise, makes the scene more dramatic. But all of that drama about these tweaks in much ado about nothing. They don't change the impact of the movies. They don't change the story. It should also be noted that this set has broke records in Blu-ray sales, despite what naysayers predicted. And I find these attacks on George Lucas to be childish.  Now, as for the picture and sound quality. The 1080p HD transfers are better than I've seen the movies look. They look crisp and I saw details I've never seen before on my Samsung 1080p LCD. My Sony home theater system got a work out with the new DTS-HD soundtracks.   As for the bonus material, I haven't had a chance to watch all of it yet, but the deleted scenes and vintage TV specials are all I needed. The rest is just icing on the cake.  So, if you love these movies and love watching movies in HD, I highly recommend them.

B0051MKMNC|3.0|I loved the plot concept. But it's execution was kind of stupid. It could have been a lot smarter than it was. It leaves me with many questions to ask.  1. Why did Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) not pay back the Russian loan-shark? He made millions of dollars super fast (completely legally), and the loan was only $100,000. If the drug made him smarter, why did he forget to do this? More than half of his problems in this film would not have happened had he remembered to do this. But did he really forget? He couldn't have. Maybe he thought he could get away with the money without paying him back? Who knows?  2. Why did he not immediately try to ration his limited supply of NZT? Or better yet, why didn't he immediately seek out a scientist to either make more of the drug or find out how to reverse engineer it? He starts deliberately taking more than he should. He should have known the bad effects that would have occurred.  3. Why did Eddie allow Carl van Loon (Robert DeNiro) to convince him to continue working for him when Eddie politely told him his plans to go his own way? The only argument van Loon had was \\"I know this business and have more experience.\\" Realistically speaking, this argument is useless considering the superior mental power that Eddie had and the superior rate at which HE was making money compared to van Loon.  4. When Lindy took the NZT to escape the trench coat assassin, she immediately knew how to do parkour? She doesn't look like she's in shape to be running and hopping over everything. No drug makes you good at parkour without practice.  5. Similar to note number 4, Eddie becomes a master fighter because the NZT helped him remember fighting videos he watched? Anyone who tries to do what they see in martial arts movies without any proper training ends up dead. No drug will make you fight better unless it makes you move so fast that the world is in slow motion and you're not.  This film should have been much smarter.
B005GSY23M|5.0|When I owned a record store back in the '90s, I had a couple customers who bought absolutely nothing but soundtracks. And not interesting soundtracks, either. We're talking the soundtrack to \\"Weekend at Bernie's II.   But had this soundtrack been available then, I wouldn't have been so baffled. It's not only the best soundtrack I've heard since \\"The Doom Generation,\\" but it's also one of my top 10 albums for 2011.  Others have done a wonderful job of analyzing how deftly the director of drive incorporated music into the movie. I'll simply add that as lacomic as the characters are verbally, relying on expressions and body language to convey so much meaning, the soundtrack is asked to take on a heady roll of its own. It's the Robin to the main character's batman.  And the singles from this album, the first five songs -- the first three in particular -- are exquisite, touching and at times danceable.  I saw this movie four tmes opening week, and the soundtrack was one thing that kept me coming back.

0670022411|5.0|A Discovery of Witches is a novel that entered the mainstream in a time when it's genre of magic/witches/vampires etc... has been grossly overwritten. You can hardly walk into a bookstore without some cheap paperback detailing the sallacious adventures of a witch/vampire/demon/werewolf and her witch/vampire/demon/werewolf boyfriend practically smacking you in the face the minute you cross the threshold. It is the new 'harlequin romance' and, as with any genre of burgeoning popularity, we've been inundated by lousy novels to the point where that particular area of the bookstore (much like Goodwill) necessitates the wading through of loads of tripe whilst clinging to the hope that you might stumble across something exceptional.   A Discovery of Witches is that exceptional novel that you hope to stumble across. I'm not posting this review with the guarantee that everyone will love the novel- novels are somewhat like people in that no one book is going to hit it off with everyone. But A Discovery of Witches was, for me, a Great Read. I've read some reviews scorning the small details the author gives, but I think that those very details are what sets a book apart. No, it is not absolutely necessary for us to know what the narrator is wearing when she walks out the door, what the library smells like to her and what emotions it evokes- but knowing these things is what makes the difference between reading a book and experiencing a book.  Reviews are individual, and they are not the absolute final word on a novel's 'worth'. They are opinions. And in my opinion, this book is wonderful.
0385341008|4.0|A very enjoyable read.  Good information about how people survive under hardship and keep a sense of humor. A good book to keep in the car for those unexpected delays, easy to pick up, read a letter or two and can return to it anytime.

0316017930|3.0|I read this book on a 10 hours flight. I find many of the writings fascinating and enlightening. I do not do sufficient research to dispute some of the writings (being an academic myself, that's my job to provide critiques). However, as a Chinese from Singapore, I think I'm able to challenge Malcolm's point that Chinese learn math faster than Western kids. Over 20% of children in Singapore do not learn Chinese as a second language, and schools in Singapore teaches all subjects in English except Chinese language. Thus, even among all the Chinese kids in school, as many as 30-40% of them do not know Chinese well enough to use it to solve Math problems. I was taught to use English to solve my math problems, and started counting 1-100 in English. All Maths problems appear in English and not Chinese in the country... just like other sciences, at least the generation after Singapore gains independence after 1965. Maybe Malcolm should learn something about Singapore before he claims what he has in the book. In addition, my Indian friends who learn Hindi learn Math much better than my Indian friends who learn Tamil. In fact, some of my Indian friends are probably better in Math than Chinese. My tiny knowledge of Hindi and Tamil number crunching: their numbers are more complicated than English. Maybe it's the complexity of Hindi that makes Hindi speaking Indians better in the formation of words, but I cannot confirm if that's true. My son learns how to count in English, and know how to count from 1-100 in English (yes, we live in the United States) when he's 3 1/2  years old..... the reason? Well, I'm a professor in engineering and he learns from me how to use numbers, and my wife loves to teach him math and language. He develops language skills later than most kids as we're training him to be tri-lingual (English, Chinese and Spanish). But once he gets them, he flies! So I see no correlations between good math performance in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore. The number of syllabus, as proven by the Indians, do not dictate how young children learn math. It's just like how most Basketball players are Afro-Americans, while many second generations Chinese are academics or engineers... what their parents or their society want them to be. Cheers... just my two cents.

B005HG4C4C|5.0|When the James Labrie solo album came out, I was blown away by the groove of Mr. Mangini. I remember thinking that if Portnoy ever left, he'd be the guy I hoped they'd pick. His power and groove are unmatched. Flash forward a few years.....it happened.<br /><br />This album brings back some of the older sound of the atmospheric keyboard parts, heavier vocal tones, guitar tones and some elements that I've wanted more of since Awake.<br /><br />While I've never heard an album by anybody that has lived up to the standard that Awake set, this comes very close.<br /><br />Dream Theater definitely lives on. No disrespect to Mike Portnoy, considering he decided to step away, but Mike Mangini is the 'Man' and will definitely keep the DT train going strong.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|In 1977, Journey made a major move in acquiring Steve Perry as their lead singer and he undoubtedly was the key factor in their rise to superstardom at the beginning of the `80s.  In 1981 founding member Gregg Rolie left the band and Jonathan Cain was drafted to replace him as another piece fell into place as the band became an AOR monster with the addition of Cain. `Escape' became Journey's biggest selling album and remains, thirty years after its release, the most consistent seller in the catalog. \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" continued Journey's run of anthemic ballads but this was simply the best and is probably their most popular if not their greatest song.  \\"Who's Cryin' Now\\" and \\"Open Arms\\" became prom mainstays but `Escape' isn't all sappy love songs. Two of the band's most enduring rockers \\"Stone in Love\\" and the title track showed that Neal Schon could still blast away impressive riffage while \\"Mother, Father\\" was another song in their earlier progressive mode.  I have recently come away with the opinion that `Escape' is my favorite Journey record as well though I also love `Evolution' as well. There is no doubt that AOR would be dominated by the band through the mid-`80s until that old band killer, personality conflicts, would rise up and derail the string of multi-platinum successes. Yet still they ride...
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I'm an Anthrax fan since the 80's, loving their power, crunch and ferocity. Joey was always a wicked singer, but got a little to rap styled in later releases, and not utilizing his full power. Now he is back and sounds better than ever, using his melodic range and rhythmic vocal attack to full potential.<br /><br />The production is top notch. Guitars are crunchy, bass is clear and pounding and the drums are super tight. The songs are well written and it sounds like the guys are really reinvigorated.<br /><br />If you're a fan of any era of Anthrax, this album is a must have.
B005EGXM7I|5.0|This comes out right after I get done with the 4th book....is there going to be another set for 5-10 please....I dont know if I should buy the next book right now, I wanna get it in a set!
B001R4MEUM|5.0|One of the few albums I would listen to from beginning to end.  Quite a time investment for a double album, but I love when it gets to the Colony of Slippermen and he is chasing the ravine after his mojo \\"...and though it narrows, he still flies very fast..\\".
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|\\"Dumbo\\" is, quite simply, one of the greatest films of all time; animated or live-action. The movie is a masterpiece of animated, economical and, above all, emotional storytelling. On the surface, the story may seem simple, but the movie has more emotional impact than any other Disney film. Was there any other Disney character who suffered more abuse and mistreatment than Dumbo? Well, maybe Cinderella. And, like Cinderella, Dumbo rises (Dumbo literally flies) above his miserable circumstances and achieves a heartwarming triumph.<br />  Anyone who has felt like a misfit or an outcast from society will relate to the plight of poor elephant Dumbo; who is labeled a literal \\"circus freak\\" just because of his oversized ears. When his mother. Mrs. Jumbo, protects him from a bratty circus patron, she is jailed. Dumbo's only friend is Timothy, an enterprising little mouse who plans to make Dumbo a circus star. When the first plan goes disasterously awry, causing the Big Top to topple, Dumbo is furthur humilated by being turned into a clown. After Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink from a water bucket filled with whiskey  , they find themselves up in the treetops the next morning. A group of wisecracking crows suggest that Dumbo got up into the trees by flying up. Lacking confidence, Dumbo is told that a \\"magic feather\\" held in his trunk will make him fly. Back at the circus, the feather is dropped and Timothy reveals it was just a psychological device. Timothy tells him he could fly all the time, if he will just open up his ears and BELIEVE in himself. Thus, Dumbo becomes a star at last when his big ears, once considered to be his greatest liability, become his greatest asset. Dumbo's triumph is especially sweet, because the audience has suffered along with Dumbo. Our tears are honestly shed, and our smiles at his victory are joyous.<br />  \\"Dumbo\\" is  Disney's most unpretentious classic; The animation style of \\"Dumbo\\" recalls the happy, vibrant spirit and colors of Disney's earlier \\"Silly Symphonies\\" short cartoons; before the \\"feature-length\\" sensation of \\"Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs.\\" \\"Dumbo\\" is a perfectly emotionally balanced film; alternately heartbreaking and heartwarming. The music is another great aspect of the film. \\"Casey Jr.\\" establishes the perfect circus mood. Three other moments, each very different in tone and mood, are memorable moments in music and animation. If you don't cry during the gentle lullabye \\"Baby Mine\\", your heart must be made of stone. \\"Pink Elephants On Parade\\"  is a wild, surreal sequence. Finally, the crows big number \\"When I See An Elephant Fly\\" provides a pivitol turning point in the film.<br />  The 70th Anniversary Edition improves over previous DVD releases of the film, with better animated menus and more vibrant colors. A short segment on the popular \\"Dumbo Ride\\" at Disneyland and Disneyworld is included. Best of all is a 28 Minute \\"Making Of Dumbo\\" documentary, detailing how Walt Disney found \\"Dumbo\\" at a time of great financial crisis. Disney's  first animated feature \\"Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs\\" (1937) was instantly acclaimed as one of the most groundbreaking films in cinema history and quickly broke box-office records.  Disney spent all the money made from \\"Snow White\\" on \\"Pinocchio\\" and \\"Fantasia\\", neither of which returned a profit. To survive, Disney needed a shorter, smarter story and \\"Dumbo\\" was absolutely perfect. Lacking the \\"high art\\" pretentiousness of \\"Fantasia,\\" \\"Dumbo\\" is, converesly emotional art, and the public took \\"Dumbo\\", released just before Pearl Harbor and America's involvement in World War II, to heart immediately. \\"Dumbo\\" was in production while an animators' strike was looming at Disney Studios. The animators must have felt a special emotional connection to \\"Dumbo\\"; because they completed it just before going on strike.<br />  \\"Dumbo\\" is always in my heart. I think every person should have \\"Dumbo\\" in their DVD collection, but you won't be able to watch it without a big box of Kleenex.of Kleenex.
0446581356|4.0|I like the book a lot. It has a lot of helpful tutorials and business info. It did not have many advanced tutorials just pictures no contouring or highlighting tutorial or info at all.
B000ECX0QU|3.0|This one is often overlooked film in the middle of Hitchcock's greats, for good reasons.<br />The story has 4 parts.<br />The 1st part relates to the KGB official defection and thereafter.<br />The 2nd part is in Cuba, which I feel dragged a little as the 1st.<br />The 3rd part is in New York city and the most dramatic one. The role of Philippe Dubois (the florist-cum-spy) is a pleasure to watch and reminds similar character in Bond's spy stories.<br />The 4th part, mostly in Paris, is the only part which deals with the title issue, the 'Topaz'.<br /><br />In the end, I feel the Topaz issue (which really happened in '62) could have been given more space and depth in the film than the missile crisis issue - no matter whether they are related or not. But the film did just the opposite which left questions and motives on the Topaz issue unanswered and the film bit long.<br /><br />Overall, it is an enjoyable film to watch - like a Bond film.<br />Best passages are the defection and the Uribe/Parra part in NYC.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I believe lady A truly has a winner here...I have never really been a fan of them, but I  will have to concede that this is a great cd..this is without comparing them to a more typical sound or music style that would generally be more to my liking. The sound is clean crisp and has good musicianship and great vocal blending. Peaceful tunes for the most part (my wife loves them) but not boring and drab or vocally overbearing.<br />  I have a wide variation in my musical likes, but essentially the musicianship is always at the forefront. This cd has a good blend of both vocals and musical accompaniment. Very clean and distinct composition......  easily their best, so far.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I read the kindle version. Very interesting premise. I think what made this story was the telling it from the perspective of the boy. I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in a couple of days. At first though, you're not sure exactly why they are trapped in the room. Then a few chapter in you find out she has been kidnapped. I'll definitely read other titles by Ms. Donahue.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This album is epic-level awesome. All of the songs sound very different and original. There is nothing else out there that sounds like AWOL. All of the songs have an infective quality to them, and get stuck in your head easily.
B0050PYNO4|3.0|This was a cute movie and it did have some funny parts.  I did watch the entire film, but I didn't need to buy it for my collection.  This is a rental.  If you love comedy or any of the main actors, you will appreciate the film.  Even if you are not a comedy fan, you will find the movie entertaining.  This film is a filler and does nothing spectacular to make it exceptional.  Paul is a thoughtful, yet outwardly ignorant little alien being assisted by two comic book geeks.  The story is cute and you end up cheering for the home team by the end.
0553386794|1.0|I read 5 chapters before tossing this novel in the garbage.  In four of the chapters, someone or something was dead, dying, or about to be made that way.  In the fifth, some out-of-favor lord is literally prostituting his 13-year-old sister as a means to regain power.  Setting aside the morality, biology,  and ethics of this situation and just considering a world of power politics and raw aggression, if this act constitutes a genuine power-play (as some other reviews suggest it is), then the political structure of that world is completely inane and fantastical (i.e. delusional).  And if this tidbit was thrown in gratuitously, then it was disgusting.  Either way, I'm not interested in that world.
B0051CSI0G|4.0|Yes, it is yet another vampire flick and what kind of a title is Stakeland?  Well, before you pre-judge this film and pass it by, keep my words in mind.  This was a Great film.  My wife and I were so immersed, we couldn't bear to have it end.  It had the feel of an HBO/TMN series.  The acting and special effects supported the novel approach this storyline took.  If you even remotely enjoyed zombieland, then you will love this film, which is all that and more, without the humor, and with a whole lot of seriousness.  If you like horror or vampire or zombie-like films, this must be added to your collection.  A parentless boy travels this wasteland with a loner survival expert.  The boy is learning the lesson of staying alive in a land infested with the undead and human organizations that are equally dangerous.  This film has action, adventure, humor, violence, blood, suspense and even a few heart warming moments.
B00200K2UG|5.0|I'll admit it, I'm a pack rat. I have more stuff in my camera bag that I'll ever need. Having said at least I know that all my stuff is in one location, in one bag. The price? It has gotten just a little to heavy to lug around all day. So, the good news is that it is a fantastic bag with lots of room, protection for equipment, and evident quality construction. It accommodates two camera bodies with lens and battery grips attached, a handful (6 to be exact) of other lens, two flash units, filters, and a bunch of other accessories and tools. The bad news is that this conglomeration gets really heavy. So, with this bag safely storing all that stuff, and I use a smaller bag when I go mobile carrying only the things needed (hopefully) for the shoot. Obviously, non-pack rats will appreciate the fact that the bag is simply roomy, tremendously flexible in configuration, and protects its contents well.
1401324029|4.0|NAKED HEAT the second installment of the Richard Castle books, made popular by the ABC show Castle was good, but nothing will compare to the chemistry of the T.V. characters portrayed by Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic.<br /><br />Being a fan of the television show, and an avid reader, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to read the books spoken about in the T.V. show.  And while the books read like an episode of Castle, you just don't get the same spark from paper that you do from Richard Castle and Kate Beckett.<br /><br />Since I usually read Christian fiction so that I can avoid gratuitous sex scenes or unnecessary language, I prepared myself for language and sensuality I would consider comparable to a television program.  I did not expect to find the F-word in the dialogue, and some of the other questionable content I found to be cruder than I expected.  I am an adult, and can over look these things, but I hope they don't escalate as the series continues.<br /><br />A good mystery overall. The crimes being solved and the twists that involved so many suspects was calculated and intriguing.  And yes, you could see Castle and Beckett in your minds eyes as you read along.  It would be nice, if in future installments, the characters depicting Ryan and Esposito were expounded upon  since they all make such a good team.  Enjoyable!
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I hate to lug around extra weight. . .unless there's a payback. The grip does indeed add some weight but the pros outweigh the cons. Having the extra battery certainly does extend shooting time, but the ability to go to portrait mode and have something formed and solid to grip is fantastic especially while having all necessary controls at your finger tips in that mode. Attachment to the camera body is easy and rock solid. . .the usual Canon build quality. I have one on both Canon 7D's and would make the observation that the aftermarket units such as one I put on my backup Canon 30D are not of the same quality as the Canon product. In such instances you do seem to get what you pay for.
0743298020|5.0|Ahhh! I do not really know where to begin in reviewing this book because there are so very many great things to be said about it.  The first thing that comes to mind, are the many different paths that it takes the reader down.  It will keep you guessing for all 708 glorious pages.  Just when you think you have something figured out, there comes along another unforeseen twist.<br /><br />The characters are awesome!  Each of them have such depth that they become real and leap from the pages right  into your reality.  This story is being narrated by a lovely girl named Margaret.  Margaret is a bibliophile, a biographer, and in a way she is also a detective.  She is writing the life story of the world's most beloved authoress, Ms Winter.  Along the way, Margaret gets herself caught in to the  mysterious past of Ms Winters.  Not only is Margaret writing the biography , but she is also trying to solve the mystery that she has gotten herself mixed up in.  All the while she is lost in Ms Winter's story, she is also dealing with her own personal demons.<br /><br />You will form many, many questions along the way, but not to worry because they will all be answered in the end.  Don't you just hate to read a book that leaves you hanging?  Well, The Thirteenth Tale will not do that.  Every mystery that is uncovered during this story will be answered.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this book!  It has something new to discover around every corner!
0792838912|5.0|Very erotic movie.  Places a whole to meaning to the term \\"sex in the city\\".  Well worth watching....purchase a copy and enjoy with your significant other.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|As a 43-year-old professional -- with major credit cards and everything! -- I should not be having this much fun with a kid's toy, but I just love this thing. When my girlfriend is in the bathroom, I try to sonic open the lock. My my co-worker's monitor is on the fritz, I try to fix it sonically. I'll sonic exercise bicycles so that they burn more calories, or food so that they taste better.<br /><br />In short, this is one heck of a fun toy. Is it childish? Of course it is, but it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />I have a few minor complaints, and believe me, they ARE minor.<br /><br />First, the button that slides the glowy bit up and down falls off too easy. I need to find a way to make that more secure.<br /><br />Second, I don't like that you have to have two different buttons to make sounds depending on where they glowy bit is. That just seems like a design shortcoming.<br /><br />Third and most importantly, the little pen nib keeps falling off. It's annoying and embarrassing. Fortunately, I have an intended solution: I'm going to glue it on with plastic model cement. I didn't buy this thing to use as a pen so I really don't care if permanently attaching the nib prevents me from changing the ink. It'll be much better with it not falling off. Hell, if I need to write with it and the ink runs out, I can always just buy a new one.<br /><br />I would have preferred it if this had been made of metal, but I understand cost and safety would be an issue.<br /><br />These nits aside, I love, love, LOVE this sonic screwdriver!!!!
B000J4QWMC|5.0|this is easily one of my favorite movies.  mostly because i think Li Gong is one hot 40 something lady.  i like the plot and characters too,  very good job on Colins part.  Jaime was good too, but he seems to keep playing the same character in every police or military bit he does. some parts are fast paced while other are too slow, but overall great movie if you pay attention. absolutely love the soundtrack.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|this is my new winner.  First off, the DVD is just the proverbial icing, and it's from different shows than the CDs, somebody cared to do this right.  I loved the Highlights disc from The Plugged Nickel, even though Miles was not playing his best, the band still sounded inspired.  Two years down the road, the inspiration is still flowing and Miles' technical facilities are back in full force.  New material, at this point is like a fresh breathe and the \\"live\\" factor ups the ante considerably.  These tunes, Agitation, Footprints, Riot, Masqualero, Gingerbread Boy are OK in their studio versions but \\"live\\" they're juggernauts, jumping off points for a band finding inspiration in the elasticity of the material.  The tunes often flow one into another until you're completely lost in their quest for something original.  IMHO This new release is the best example of Miles' great 2nd quintet at their apex, at a reasonable price and a great way to kick off this series.  Now, if they could only find a place to store the booklet, we'll be all set.  I marvel at how many jazz bands try to emulate the sound of this band, today.  This is the source of that wellspring.
B004VS4KLW|4.0|great movie, a little slow during the whole movie. Even the car chase scene which is considered one of the best is too drawn out for me, maybe cause i've seen it a million times, it was great only in the theater.  at home just too slow.  DVD has full screen on one side of disk and wide screen on other, don't like menu effects,takes too long to get there.  but still love the movie.
0823095223|5.0|I love this book! It has tons of color photos and how to's, along with great narrative writing about the sculpture process in regards to PoP culture images. Very motivational! Whenever I am in a sculpting slump.. I flip through some books and this is always in the stack!<br /><br />Buy it!
B0052WSX32|5.0|Doris Day has never disappointed her adoring fans; this newly released album is yet another reason to celebrate! Indeed, this is quite a fine album; there's not a bad track in the lot. True, these songs were not recorded only yesterday, but that makes no difference; I enjoy listening to this CD immensely and so will any Doris Day fan! She manages to convey so much genuine heart and soul as she sings; and that's grand.<br /><br />The album begins with Doris singing her heart out on \\"Hurry, It's Lovely Up Here.\\" Her excellent diction, sophisticated phrasing and keen sense of timing are immediately apparent as they are on every track on this album--terrific! \\"Daydream\\" (originally done by The Lovin' Spoonful) sounds terrific when Doris sings it; she puts her own stamp on this tune with her own interpretation of it. \\"The way I Dreamed It\\" by Doris' late son Terry Melcher and Bruce Johnston of The Beach Boys is done to perfection--and beyond! I'm very impressed.<br /><br />\\"Heaven Tonight\\" again features Doris singing faultlessly; I love it. She really makes this number shine. \\"My One and Only Love\\" is very, very good; and listen for yet another gem when Doris sings the passionate \\"My Heart;\\" as only she could. We also get a stunningly beautiful rendition of Joe Cocker's hit, \\"You Are So Beautiful;\\"  the classic \\"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries\\" that sounds fresh and new when Doris sings it; \\"Disney Girls\\" that again has Doris performing straight from the heart as she makes this song her own; the wonderful \\"My Buddy;\\" \\"Happy Endings\\" by Tony Melcher with a spoken dedication by Doris just before the song begins--and then Doris does a sublime job on \\"Ohio.\\" What a way to end the album!<br /><br />Doris Day continues to share so much of her talent with us with the release of this CD; and that's wonderful. This CD is a must-have for Doris Day fans; and anyone who enjoys high quality control, five star music will want to add this to their music collection.
030788743X|5.0|Ok. I felt compelled to write. I truly enjoyed this book. It's sort of like 1984 and and breakfast of champions mixed together with some marshmallow fluff and the wizard of oz thrown in. I'm not a gamer or a Big sci-fi fan. But, I know my ultra man and the tag line for the dunkin donuts ads of the 80s...
0140277447|5.0|This book was such a compelling read I finished in a day. An important but disturbing book which everyone should read. The rape of Nanking was an atrocities which was nearly lost due to the over shadowing atrocities of the Nazis. This is what History is about to learn, never forget and never repeat. The author has written a well balanced book dealing with all sides of the event. It is a book I will never forget.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I hate to start off a review with a cliche that has plagued most reviews here, which is the history thing. I got into DT back in 2006, and strangely enough through a Liquid Tension Experiment song my guitar teacher showed me, Acid Rain. Pure audio insanity, if there is such a thing! Since then I have gone on to listen to Dream Theater's actual songs, and collect their albums and what not. And they do have some really awesome and heavy stuff there.<br /><br />However, I did not love Six Degrees. I mean, it was alright, but just... dragged way too much. And this album was just... bad!!!! Seriously, not a single song on this album appeals to me at all. Thank god for the awesome Octavarium. In fact, if not for Octavarium I'd have considered DT dead to me.<br /><br />As I Am has a nice distorted/soft intro, and the guitars kicking in with the drums for a few more measures are nice too... But then the song itself kicks in, and it's just a total Metallica ripoff. The song tries to make up for it by adding in a few crazy solos, but no can do.<br /><br />This Dying Soul... Ugh. I cannot name a single thing about this that didn't make me want to bash my head in.<br /><br />Endless Sacrifice did not need to be 11 minutes long. It has nice verses but the chorus is just a nu-metal mess. Seriously Theory of a Deadman could have written this song, it's that bad,<br /><br />Honour Thy Father. James raps in this song, what more needs to be said.<br /><br />Vacant.... If you can remember this song, you're too much of a DT fan.<br /><br />Stream of Consciousness. Wow, what can I say about this song except that it's absolutely boring!  It's an instrumental, which wouldn't be such a bad thing if there were any catchy or memorable riffs or hooks. There aren't any, and seriously, Restrictor plates need to be put on John Petrucci's guitar and Jordan Rudess' keyboard. I love them but since SDOIT all their songs are about are them battling it out against each other.<br /><br />In the Name of God is just... BAD. Another song that's 14 minutes long with no reason behind said length whatsoever. No meaning to the song either, couldn't wait for it to be over.<br /><br />In short, thank god DT pulled their socks up after this shameful effort. They really should be ashamed of themselves for this album.aid length whatsoever. No meaning to the song either, couldn't wait for it to be over.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love plants vs zombies but if this is a very lazy, non-optimized, battery sucking port missing the Zen Garden, mini-games, and buggy losing saves, this port doesn't come close to the entertainment level of the PC PvZ.  If popcap decides to code this game FOR Android and keeps it the same level of fun, ill buy it definitely.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was highly recommended to me, and I'm so glad I read it!! At times Abby really frustrated me because I felt like Travis was making all kinds of changes for her, and she just threw it in his face with Parker. Granted, she wasn't having sex with Parker but it hurt Travis just the same. I appreciated that the conflict was tied into action, and not just the everyday lives of the characters. There were fights, and trips to Vegas thrown in there. I felt like the conflict was realistic, even though it annoyed me.<br /><br />The only thing I hated about this book was the level of obliviousness Abby displayed. And it was written in first person. There was no mention of her being aware of his feelings at all for her. So clearly she was either in a deep state of denial, or was just blind.<br /><br />I loved the nickname Travis gave her.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Congrats to George Lucas. In his lifetime he has managed to create the greatest trilogy in film history and the worst trilogy in film history.
0316098329|5.0|My book arrived very quickly after my order and was brand new. I am very pleased with this merchant, and I would definitely used them again.
0670022411|5.0|I loved this book. It is a complex book, filled with interesting people and a very interesting take on the paranormal universe. I can understand why some people don't like it. To a large extent this is a genre book that has broken out into the best seller world, a lot like the Anne Rice books did in the 70s and again in the 90s. But if what you enjoy is literary fiction, you are going to be miserable. This is not literary fiction.  If you enjoy the various kinds of paranormal fiction, you are going to love this book. If you are willing to have some romance enter your fiction, you will also enjoy the book.  The plot has several levels. One of them is the love story between the two main characters who happen to be a witch, with a lot of potential who isn't using it, and a vampire with a lot of history and power behind him. Another is the universe itself which has more than one sentient species in it. In fact there are four of them. And the undercurrents running under the radar where three of the species are hiding from the forth which is the majority.  And something has come to a crux, and things are beginning to change. And if this is the first book in a series, and I hope it is, we are going to discover a lot more about that crossroads and those changes. I am really looking forward to what might happen next.  I also give the author points for presenting a set up for what happens next without doing a cliffhanger. If there is no second or third book I'll be disappointed, but I won't be mad as hell.  Basically this is a good read with a lot of depth. And that is what all the fuss is about.
030788743X|5.0|Got this as a audio book when I saw Will was the reader.  As someone born on the min 70s and the kind of kid who had a TSr-80 when I was 4  I loved this book to death.  I played it nearly non stop over 2 days start to finish.  The story was well paced and the characters are very believable (well if your a geek like me). The references were one big wonderful nostalgia trip.  Only down side was the ending.  It wrapped up well but i was hoping for something open to a sequel.  I will be on the look out for more books by this author.
B005DD7H50|2.0|This movie is so lame and dumb that I felt stupid for renting this. ROFL to those who said this is a thought-provoking or smart movie.
B0037KMHRY|1.0|The music is very good, But the fancy black disc will not download to my X Box 360. I like to listen to my own music on random play from my X Box.  I just cant listen to Tron legacy.  This was a wast of my hard earned cash.
B00005V9QJ|3.0|I am a huge Sade fan. Having seen the Lovers Live concert on DVD a number of times I thought it would be great to have an audio version so I could enjoy the same live versions in my car, on my mp3 player, etc. Well I guess I didn't read the description well enough. While this IS audio from that DVD concert, it's not ALL the audio. They've only included the songs from the concert that are on the Lovers Rock album!  Not really what I wanted. If you're looking for the entire concert in this CD don't bother...it's not there.
0399250395|5.0|Aside from the 'classics' we all read in school, there are a few stand-outs for little ones.  This book is on that list.  The 40th anniversary edition is simply spectacular.  The cover is well-made and glossy for durability.  The pages are substantially thick enough to not be easily torn.  And the colorful pop-out pictures are fabulous.  This book is even better than the one I read to my kids.<br /><br />For a classroom teaching tool, it will capture the children's attention.  It's entertaining.  As you turn the pages, the story can be used to teach 'metamorphosis'; how a caterpillar morphs into a beautiful butterfly.<br /><br />It brought a smile to the face of one of my grown sons when he saw I was wrapping it as part of a newborn's gift.  So many others give baby clothing and paraphernalia.  Why not start a child on a lifetime of reading pleasure?  Give the gift that starts their own library.  The very fabulous, entertaining, and educational pop-up book.
0553801473|4.0|a caveat from me, I did not get into these books until I watched HBO's \\"A Game of Thrones.\\"  At the shows finale I jumped into book 2 and subsequently tore through all the rest concluding with the just read \\"A Dance with Dragons.\\"  I.e., there's been no years between books for me, roughly 3800 pages over the summer.<br /><br />Given the connection/split of AFFC and ADWD I'd have to say that AFFC and ADWD should not have been split and Martin's Editor should have insisted it be condensed and edited to move the story along.  Be that as it may, I thought the pace and focus of ADWD was much better than AFFC.<br /><br />I am starting to wonder how he's going to bring all his disparate characters & locations into any sort of conclusion.  In trying to keep this spoiler free I can only be vague in wondering how everyone reconnects in Westeros to settle the game of thrones at play and the song of ice and fire being sung from the wall down to dorne across the narrow sea in braavos and the grass sea outside of meereen.  I can only guess at how/if Ned Stark's remaining children will come back together and reclaim the north.  For that matter will House Targaryen get it together and locate the other two riders needed to saddle up the dragons and reclaim the iron throne?<br /><br />here's for hoping HBO does not catch up to the next book before it's written and published.
B004LWZW42|4.0|I initially wasn't going to see FIRST CLASS - the previous movies, plus the atrocity that was WOLVERINE, had turned me off of the film franchise as a long time fan of the comics.  My friend, though, practically forced me down and made me watch.  The movie ended up being my favorite of the franchise, though, combining an interesting plot, great action, and great directing with some good performances and a solid script.  What it didn't have going for it, though, was a solid cast.  Some of the performances were just downright atrocious - January Jones as Emma Frost and Zoe Kravitz as Angel Salvadore stood out to me as extremely inferior to what others were bringing to the film, especially James McAvoy as Xavier.  Nicholas Hoult also brought a lot to the movie as Hank McCoy, while Jennifer Lawrence disappointed me somewhat with flat delivery at times as Raven Darkholme.  Or that might have just been the plastic wig.<br /><br />Taking us back to the 1960s and the Cuban Missile Crisis (which a girl like me loves, having studied the time period extensively for grad studies in international security), we are introduced to the foundations of the X-Men and the eventually Brotherhood of Mutants, the friendship between Xavier and Erik Lensherr.  The movie is just as much about the characters as it is the action, from their evolution as people to the friendships and relationships that created the series we know and love today.  Yeah, it was totally nothing like in the comics, taking random characters from various time periods, changing nationalities and back stories, but it worked in the scheme of things.<br /><br />The action was also amazing, with fully realized scenes and twists and turns along the way.  I was genuinely surprised that this movie wasn't as bad as I was expecting.  Quite frankly, it was really good, minus some really, REALLY bad acting.  I mean, acting that was flatter than a pancake.  Definitely give this movie a shot, though.<br /><br />DVD Features: Um...what features? There was a little featurette and that was about it.  I hear the Blu-Ray features are FANTABULOUS, but as for the DVD, there isn't anything special here.  Quality of sound and video were decent, no playback issues, but there is nothing extremely great about this DVD.featurette and that was about it.

B001TK80C0|1.0|Like other one star reviewers I agree that this one is the worst of the lot. It is too bad that the very first one was so good and they got away from it totally into some fantastically, unbelievably bad story line and premise. I would advise missing this one completely.
B0013V33DG|5.0|This Met production is a true stand-out. Both leads are in fine voice -- especially if you just can't wait for Florez to string out those high notes! Originally made for high-definition telecast, the image is crystal-clear as the notes. Fast-paced with a great supporting cast to boot. You can't go wrong with this purchase.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is a great movie, not just for kids, but for adults as well.  The movie is mainly about two clown fish, Marlin, and his son, Nemo. The whole movie is centered on Marlin trying to find Nemo, hence the title \\"Finding\\" Nemo. Marlin searches the whole ocean with his new friend, Dori. They encounter a lot of dangerous and cool obstacles, like sharks, turtles, and even whales. Meanwhile, Nemo is in a fish tank and makes lots of new friends from all different pet stores, and even one from the ocean. The aquarium fish are even friends with a pelican, who has an important role later in the movie.      One of the reasons that the movie is so great is the plot. It is a father going out to find his son, but at the same time it keeps people laughing. You can sometimes guess what will be coming up next, but there are also a few surprises that you wouldn't expect. Another reason this movie is good, is that voicing is about as perfect as it could get. They couldn't have picked better voices for these characters. Each one matches the bodies perfectly. Ellen DeGeneres especially does a great job playing the role of Dori and Albert Brooks does a fantastic job with the voice of Marlin. The way each actor portrays their characters makes the film even funnier than it truly is.     One last reason is that the movie has a wonderful message. It really shows the love that parents can have for their children. Even though they might get into fights or arguments, parents are still willing to risk everything just for their child. It also shows the message of true friendship. Dori ended up being a true friend to Marlin, and Nemo made true friends with the others in the tank. The message is one of the overall best I have seen.      Overall I would give this movie 5 stars out of five. I have seen it many times, and it never gets old. I even enjoy quoting some specific of the parts in the movie. It is so great, that whenever I see a clown fish, I always think it is Nemo! You could be the same way if you watch this movie.

B005HERT80|5.0|This is one of my most favorite episodes. The nervous Lt. Barkley of the low self-esteem is a perfect anecdote for the high-performing Enterprise crew. And, when he is transformed into a superior intelligence, he sets everyone on their heels. Interesting and amusing.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|You can never get too much of a good thing, and the Eagles are really a good thing when they are on stage together.  The theater is a little different for them, but the show is great, I have watched it many times, and enjoy it each and every time.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This film is really an eye opener. I'm no economist, Harvard maestro, and do not pretend to be an expert in any of the issues, I'm just trying to learn the reasons without all bias political bull/s. This film did a good job of explaining many of the reasons for the American 2008 financial downfall.<br /><br />It is really depressing because you realize money lobbyists, politicians, and greedy banks with deep pockets are the ones that are king in Washington.<br /><br />The poor, middle class, and the ignorant do not seemed to have a chance in America nowadays.<br /><br />If all Americans would educate themselves of the issues occurring in our country, we would be angry realizing how Washington, lobbyists, banks, even our stupid regulators such as SEC screwed us up by looking the other way. But the sad part is that people are either too busy trying to keep a roof over their heads, and food on the table, or honestly they don't care to be keeping tabs of the complicated mess in Washington.<br /><br />This film included<br /><br />- How investments banks work (which I found very interesting),<br />- Explained deregulation of investment banks starting with President Reagan,<br />-Shows interviews with President of Harvard & Dean of Columbia which is interesting to see how hostile they become when they realize thier dirty laundry will be on air for everybody to see.<br />- It also show clips of banks CEO'S squirming when questioned by Congress.<br />-The big atrocity of rating agencies such as S&P who gave great ratings to toxic investments which people relied on and invested on them, such as the Mississippi retirement group<br />-The big disappointment of our current administration not doing anything to prosecute these dogs.<br /><br />What would make anybody sick is that many of these greedy parasites didn't go to prison for what they did to the American people.<br /><br />And there's plenty of blame to pass around here, it is sick...<br /><br />We, Americans, need to stop this madness.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This shows David doing what he does best. His performance, and that of his group is par none.  I think David is one of the top guitar players in the world, and this shows without his having to show off. He just plays at a level others cannot soar to.  This tour was close to the end of Richards life, but he seems so happy to be with this bunch. John Carin was with Roger Waters a few years ago, but he saw the light and came where he would be appreciated.  Great show, great recording.
B004HW7JMO|1.0|This was just bad.  The first season was excellent, had a story, a plot, great acting,and was based on historical events and characters (yes, there was a Crixus, and yes he did lead with Spartacus until they parted ways).  Gods of the Arena felt like the fill-in series it was, almost pointless, and ended the way we already knew it would.  It also gave John Hannah an opportunity to shed his likeable character from \\"The Mummy\\" series, and unfortunately it worked.  The extensive and continued dropping of the F-Bomb was distracting from what little story we could follow, and was hardly shocking after the first 30 minutes.  Just annoying. And yes, their continued use of \\"Apologies\\" was tedius.  I look forward to the next season, unfortunatly without Andy Whitfield.  Hopefully the next season will have an actual storyline and do a better job of creating the excitement and passion that was Rome.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I enjoy every minute of this recording. These guys don't performe together often, but magic happens when they do. This is a super performance.
B0059DOJGY|5.0|I think all of you who continue to wish Edguy would \\"regress\\" back to the \\"olden days\\" should take a chill pill and enjoy their current output.  This band from Hellfire Club to present has largely hit the nail on the head and whatever Tobias is trying to achieve these days, it certainly works for me. Bands often take what they have done early in their career and then refine it into something more concise and easier to digest with less repeated plays, and you know what?  That's ok. Yes, I liked Tinnitus Sanctus, too. I'm just glad that while my favorites like Judas Priest and the Scorps are winding it down, Edguy is still revving it up. Age of the Joker absolutely ROCKS! I love this album. Don't listen to the naysayers...they just don't get it.

0307272702|4.0|A book like this is a tricky one to rate, after all the ideas presented here don't exactly represent a consensus of modern science. But, the book is a quick and easy read and is packed with great information. One of the nice things about the author is that while he presents these ideas, he also presents the research to back it up. Just be aware that you can likely find reasearch out there that disagrees. Having spent a fair bit of time digging into various bits of research, the ideas presented here do strike me as some of the more plausible out there.  HOWEVER...  One thing that bothered me is the author's statements about how calories in - calories out is just plain wrong, and all that matters is what you eat. While I certainly believe it's true that what you eat matters, and eating a lot of sugar is bad for your health and may limit weight loss, I can't agree that throwing the calorie equation out the window is what you need to do. Calories still matter, no matter what the author says. While it's not a simple matter of intake vs output, it's also not a simple matter of just eating the 'right' foods. As an example, if you were to eat 800 calories of twinkies per day for 2 months I guarantee you that you will lose weight. Likewise if you eat 5,000 calories a day of steak, I guarantee you will gain weight. The author seems to suggest otherwise. Now I'll readily admit, if you were to eat 1200 calories per day of twinkies vs 1200 calories per day of steak, then the steak diet is likely to produce more weight loss than the twinkie diet, and probably better health as well.  Overall, I think the advice is solid, I really just wished he'd mentioned that calories still matter and you still need to pay attention to portions.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|The Blu Ray DVD's of the Star Wars saga are wonderful.  The picture quality and the sound are incredible but most important, the story that we have loved for so long is still there.  This amazing story came from the heart, mind and soul of George Lucas.  If he thinks his changes are enhancing his vision,  then is should be his right and maybe obligation to make those changes.  I loved these movies from the beginning and nothing Mr. Lucas has done has made me alter my opinion.  The changes he has made have only made the pictures better.  If you care for these movies, than you have to care for the person responsible, and trust his judgement.  That person is George Lucas.  Nett 49
B0052WSX32|5.0|I absolutely love this album!!!Although I had heard some of the songs when Doris did her \\"Best Friends\\" television show, I found this to be a real treasure. The songs have been remastered for this release and they all sound superb. Doris Day will always be legendary for her soft, silky, and sometimes seductive way of delivering a song. No fan of this woman's should be without this album, for it not only let's us in on her impeccable singing, it also brings us back to early baby boomer times. You know, when life was magical and thrilling...when fantasy made us believe all things were possible.   The song \\"Disney Girls\\" does that for us, as we journey to the past and the things that made us smile. Then, with the addition of a poignant, but heartfelt song done by Doris' son, Terry Melcher, you have the cherry on the cake with a song called \\"Happy Endings.\\" Though, originally written by him for his mother, the song hits direct to the heart as Terry reminisces of those old days gone by...and of course, \\"Happy Endings\\" becomes the charmer of the album. Sadly, Terry has passed, but his legacy, talent, and his sweet charm lives in this album.   The remastering of songs like \\"Heaven Tonight\\", \\"This Is The Way I Dreamed It\\", and \\"My Heart\\", which is the title of the album, makes you wish Doris was still recording today. You remember clearly when you hear these songs why the whole world fell in love with Doris Day. Why, even today, her fans still yearn for her music, and her music only. I personally would have loved it if the album had included Doris' single, \\"Moonlight Lover.\\" Maybe it will come in the next one...we can only hope there is more to come.   When you finish hearing the album, you will delight in what you hear. Perhaps, you will smile many times as I did as Doris takes you into her world of charm. However, be prepared, as charming and lovely as this album is, you will also feel a tinge of sorrow for how good music like this has been left behind. Perhaps, we can all vote to bring it back...buy the album and it will be a good step in the right direction. Hey, the days of fantasy and Disney Girls wasn't half bad. Thank you Ms. Day for touching our lives with your music one more time!
B000K7VHSM|1.0|\\"ERROR ON DISK\\"  I expected a two-DVD set in the jewel case but there was only one.  It had no label, as though it was not professionally burned.  It was cheap and it would not play.  This is another instance where the more expensive item may be the lowest quality.
1451629184|5.0|I really admired Jaycee for writing this book.  It gave a real insight to her feelings at the time of abduction and also  for the years afterwards. An absolute must for everyone who ever heard  about Jaycee's abduction.
B005DZMODI|4.0|WM & EC play the blues is really agood surprise, from two artists coming from different style; every item is well arranged. the only less is that this album miss of complete unity. but each piece is to enjoy !
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Chokes me up every time I see the movie. Very romantic and the DVD offers the directors comments, actors comments, etc. The reason that this is important is because it informs the viewer that Clint Eastwood acts most like his true-self than any other work he has ever played in.  I think the acting combination of Streep and Eastwood brought out the richness that this story deserves.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Pros:  I've been using this board for a month now and decided on Gigabyte due to the quality of my last board (P45-UD3R). Apart from going back to AMD (started getting into PCs back in the Athlon64 days, so I decided to gamble on AMD once again) the BIOS still seems very much familiar. Gigabyte still uses their old trusty BIOS (no UEFI yet) with plenty of options to tweak RAM, CPU, etc. The features on this board are hard to pass up for the price with USB 3.0, SATA III, two full x16 lane SLI/Crossfire support and support for the upcoming bulldozer CPUs as well as any AM3 CPU. The color scheme is dead sexy and a complete 180 degree turn from previous Gigabyte boards. I had flashed the BIOS to F3g(at the time I got this) before doing anything else and had absolutely no issues upon boot up. Windows 7 practically took care of the entire setup for me and the only drivers I actually went hunting for were the south-bridge drivers from AMDs site and the latest Etron drivers off Gigabyte's site. I would personally suggest sticking with msahci drivers for SSDs and TRIM support. Everything seems to work well with GSkill sniper 1866 memory (running @ 1333 for now), Crucial 64gb M4 SSD (average 510 Mb/s read 106 Mb/s write with 0009 firmware) and a fill-in Phenom II x3 720 BE (can't unlock or overclock past 3.4Ghz for anything unfortunately) until Bulldozer hits.    \\"Cons\\":   Now I did do my homework before going in to this, but a word of caution to potential buyers: this board (or mine at least) bumps whatever CPU voltage you set in BIOS up by .02V when the CPU is in idle and then at CPU load the voltage goes back down to your BIOS setting with occasional spikes that drop another .02V. This is with using the latest CPU-Z and HWMonitor and the F4 BIOS. Gigabyte states they followed Bulldozer specifications for this but from what I read this is better than the crazy voltage drops on the UD5 and UD7 boards.   The only other quirk I can think of is petty but might as well mention it. Gigbayte, and I believe ASRock as well, uses the Etron controller for their USB 3.0 ports which have reportedly caused some issues with certain USB devices, but in my case it takes a good 5 sec. for my USB 3.0 flash drive to be detected whereas it's instant in the usb2.0 ports (drawback of being non-native?). This is of course using the latest drivers but like I said, it's trivial and I'm sure this new tech. will perfect itself over time. O yeah, there's also no LLC control, but this may have have been implemented in the rev. 1.1 or 1.2 boards (yes there is already a rev. 1.2 board out there so hopefully Amazon sends you the latest one).    Other thoughts:   The hardest part is just waiting out Bulldozer and hoping it does well (and I haven't been waiting nearly as long as others actually). For those willing to take a gamble on bulldozer or just want to upgrade their 800 series boards, you can't go wrong with this one. Make sure to update the BIOS to F4, especially if you receive a rev 1.0 board, and you're set to go.

B00006879E|4.0|Really like this CD. It has several favorites, and some cool, jazzy songs I hadn't heard before. I'll definitely be adding another M5 CD to my collection.
0671027344|5.0|Awesome book! Worth reading. Especially for those just beginning high school. Pretty much dateless. Would apply to those in high school: then, now & in the future. Easy read that makes you want to finish the book the same day.
B00061RZBA|5.0|I love the movie Mulan, so decided to buy the DVD since my VHS is becoming antediluvian. However, I bought it from an international seller, without knowing that DVDs and videogames are domain restricted. The UK version does not work with my US DVD player. I didn't know this before!! Oh well. Mulan is still an awesome movie.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|If you don't like the changes that Lucas made to the original trilogy, then this is NOT the release for you. It would've been awesome if the originals had been included, but they weren't. I can't say I liked all the changes that were made (the song in Jaba's palace SUCKS compared to the original), but I think the majority are just cosmetic (more storm troopers here, added rocks there) and don't really affect the story. All of the movies look and sound great, really great. There are a ton of extras and haven't made my way through all of them yet. There's a whole disc with just documentaries and spoofs, which I thought was a nice touch.
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|It took a little while to get but was well worth it. the product was in such good condition and at an AMAZING price. I definitely will be buying more items from this seller in the future.

B00138J1XK|4.0|The collection is great, and quite representative. The only reason I am giving 4 and not 5 starts is that song #12, Closet Chronicles, is not available if you buy the entire album. I wish amazon would announce that.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Was extremely thrilled when I ordered this CD. Just received the CD and have enjoyed listening to each and every song. Great CD.
B004WMKSH2|2.0|For me, this was an odd movie.  First, it was dark.  Almost every scene was either dark blue or dark brown, with only glimpses of sun.  I realize this is thematic, and symbolizes the dark, almost impossible predicament, the three principals (Harry, Hermione, Ron) are in.  Second, it almost entirely lacked the interesting subordinate characters that made the previous Harry Potters so lively: Snape, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Luna, the Malfoys, the rest of the Weasleys, etc., etc. do appear, but briefly--then they are gone.  Also thematic, I realize: the isolation and loneliness are deliberately claustrophobic, and intensify the fears and hopelessness of the Big 3.  Still, these give the film a closed-in, deprived feel, that, however thematic, make it seem thin and strained.  Third, the wedding is given short shrift, while the jealousy-theme goes on interminably.  Also thematic, I know: this is the story of growing up, and all the melodrama and angst of being a teenager.  Still, all this indicates that the Epic Good-vs.-Evil conflict has taken over the movie, at the expense of everything else.  The whimsy, the craziness, the unexpected twists, the fun settings (like Hogwarts and even Harry's horrible foster-family),and the humor are all gone.  I suppose this was all deliberate, but it makes for grim watching.
0385340540|4.0|My first John Grisham book since A Time to Kill, this read was a blast! With a voice  similar to Dan Brown, I found Grisham's story about a Washington deal broker fascinating. Halfway through, I was simply unable to quite turning pages. What a pleasure.<br /><br />The depth of Italian culture in The Broker was worth the price of admission. Like all great stories, the depth of research made all the difference. In my opinion, this book is four stars because of the riveting details of Marco's new and unfamiliar journey.  A journey which gripped my intrigue page after page. Job well done, Mr. Grisham - you have a new fan.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I bought this headset for use in my tent here in Afghanistan so the sound of my XBOX wouldnt bother other people. These headphones DO NOT have a USB, just a headset and microphone plug in.  I am lucky my T.V. has a headset jack. I have not used the microphone portion of this headset but the sound is good and I can still hear whats going on around me. I am writing this review so no one else makes the mistake of buying these for use with a gaming console. Buy them for the PC.

B004EPZ07K|5.0|A lot of people are bad mouthing this movie, even before it came out in theaters. The first trailer is what started it. Then wondercon showed more footage and everyone was surprised but still skeptical. Then the premiere came, then the bad reviews came from uptight, prick reviewers. If you never read a Green Lantern comic, you have no say in this movie. This isn't a \\"magic ring\\". The ring is advanced high tech which the guardians created with green energy. The movie is pretty faithful to the comic, except in Parallax actually being the guardian Krona and how Sinestro wielded the yellow ring. I'm happy with how they brought it into the screen and didn't mind the changes. Sinestro getting the ring from the Kwardians from the antimatter universe would be too confusing for casual moviegoers. Krona is a huge character that has fought not only Green Lantern, but the rest of the DC universe and has crossed over to the Marvel universe during the DC/Marvel team up days. But that's fine. This movie used Hal's current \\"funny\\" persona from Rebirth and that's a good thing. It gives him a personality unlike the seriousness of his past comics. I loved this movie and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.

0307887898|5.0|I've read a lot of Eric's stuff before and have been to many Lean Startup meetups, so I'm familiar with the basics. This book took everything a step further and put it all in one package. Having been exposed to this stuff before, I still got tremendous value from all of the info being in one place. The language is clear, specific, and uses examples to illustrate all the concepts. With this book, I have clear action steps to use to build my start-up, rather than generalities and big concepts that  are often the focus of other books. Highly recommended read!
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I thought the picture quality was fantastic for all six films.    What I did not like at all was the difficulty in removing the blu ray discs from their individual cases.  I know that blu rays are difficult to scratch, but every time I reach for a disc and try to pull it out of the sleeve I feel like I'm going to scratch one!  Either that, or I'm going to accidentally tear the paper sleeve that the disc is in!  Who was the 'genius' who designed this?!
0446614459|5.0|As with The Winner, Split Second kept me interested from start to finish.  Given the fact that it took me about a week to finish it (due to schedule), it was a little hard to keep up with so many different characters and suspects (and since I read it on my Kindle, it wasn't a case where I could just leaf back through the pages to remind myself who someone was).<br /><br />This is only the third David Baldacci novel I've read, but all of his villains (and sometimes non-villains) seem to be masters of disguise, which is my only real complaint about Split Second.  When you know going into it that people are going to be changing their appearance, at least a few times, it could get old.  But it works for him.<br /><br />I am pleased to say that I figured out who 'the bad guy' was about a third of the way through the book, and didn't change my mind even when he tried to throw the reader off later on.  The secondary villain, though...I was way off base.<br /><br />All in all, it was a really good book.  I am sorry, though, that I bought the Kindle version, which is the same price as the paperback.
0307463745|1.0|I was anxious to read this book as it is on a must read list of someone I admire. About 1/3 into it I realized there would be nothing new for me, but I kept reading. Then I came across the \\"F\\" word and was so offended that I put the book down. What reason for such language? These authors will never have any credibility to me ever by using that kind of language in a self-help book. Save the profanity for your private offices, not on the pages of your books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story , good mix of science fiction ,mystery and survival with a bit of romance,the story will hook you one from the first pages until the end.I would go as far as to say the ending is the icing on the cake. If you are into science fiction/mystery/survival/romance you cant go wrong with this book. I would not be surprised if i see a movie adaptation in the future.
0553801473|1.0|I really, really enjoyed the first three books of this series. I was flabbergasted by how ramshackle and off Feast for Crows ended up being. I hoped for this book to be a return to how great the first three were... but I was sorely disappointed. Aside from killing some main characters, nothing happens. Oh, a few people go on journeys, they just never really arrive anywhere. The deaths that take place are rather meaningless compared to those in the first three books. It seems very clear to me that Martin had a plan for the first three and doesn't know what to do with the rest. These last two books read like material which he would have cut from the first three. I have no doubt that there will be readers out there eager for more books from George RR Martin--but I will not be one of them. I am bitter that I wasted time of my life that I will not get back reading A Dance with Dragons and Feast for Crows (thousands of pages and hours and hours of reading. I certainly will never read another of book in this series.
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|The game has a rather forward moving story with some life lessons for people if they read it.  Characters are colorful and the artwork on them is pretty nice.  The dungeon graphics are a little lacking but hey it is pretty throwback title for 8bit+.  Though the story and adventure are quite nice there are a few issues that have cropped up while i conquered the game.  Graphics: 6/10  I'd rate it higher but the map and character sprites were a little bit glitchy.  Teleporting characters and sometimes partially loaded screens distorting the picture.  nothing major but compared to other title types there could have been a bit better.  Sound: 7/10  Fun sounds, great battle music and end battle music.  A bit loud at times and then goes soft.  Especially at the title screen.  I was expecting a little bit of change from town to town and dungeon to dungeon but gave up on it being much different.  Good work though.  Gameplay: 7/10  A Wonderful throwback title.  Very reminiscent of the old 8bit games.  Fighting system is pretty easy to pick up with the similarity of movement and choose button style like Zenonia with a few difference.  Everything loads quickly after the inertial loading screen.  Moving between maps is quick and just fades in and out and bam your there. Battles are quick and the speed bar showing when you attack is very helpful especially with the break button which allows you to force an attack that may have otherwise been late (healing anyone).  The auto battle is a great feature and can honestly make the game easier once you are a bit bigger than the creatures killing.  I'd have to say the tablet system is something of a mix from ffVI and FFIII allowing you to boost your characters and give them abilities or break them.  Though there are plenty of times where you do not have a tablet to work with and your character growth just ceases... wish there were more tablets.  Controls: 4/10  Yes the controls... they aren't the best but they are not unplayable.  I mailny rate this so low due to the map screen is not in consideration of where the button placement sits.  The movement button many many many many many times sits above chests, paths, characters, just anywhere you might want to move.  It is quite annoying and shows poor decisions on map design.  It is rather touchy and if you put the non fixed keys prepare for a game that is unplayable.  Though the biggest gripe about controls is the movement key on top of the world.  Yes you can sit and wait the 20 seconds for the gui to disappear but not worth it.  Overall: 7/10  It is a great game, if you have the patients to play through the strange maps.  I wish there was some support from a community and the dev to give descriptions of stuff in english, my japanese is alright but some kanji on the page is difficult.  No game faq :) not much else on the game.  Pick it up its fun will kill some time at your desk thanks to auto battle.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|Having missed several movies in the series, DH I was a confusing, dreary bog of endless chases & snippy arguments. Glum & boring. So I was quite surprised at how tight & easy to follow the final installment was. The escape from the vault on the albino dragon was quite thrilling. Snape's big reveal was touching. I didn't have to snooze through an endless cascade of anti-climaxes like I did with LOTR: RETURN OF THE KING. Well done. 6/10
B00012QM8G|5.0|My granddaughter wanted to see this movie,and there is no place to rent it.The movie is a true story and one that needs to be seen,an excellent movie.Delivery was quick.Working with Amazon is always pleasant,with the best prices.
B004EPZ08E|1.0|As a big fan of Arrested Development, nearly all the cast and quirky clever comedies, my husband and I hoped this would fit the bill.  Sadly mistaken.  Great premise, just too overtly nasty and in your face sexual to be sustainably funny.  There can be only so many references to genitalia and sex...and then you are just not writing a script well at all...your just hoping that sex is going to be funny for 1.5 hours and people are going to keep laughing.    Funny cast, more than great possibilities...just to overt to make it happen for me.
B000009HF2|5.0|I remember hearing \\"Do You Feel\\" on the radio and just having to turn it up.  It was so different and NEW from what was being played on the air at the time, that like everyone else, I needed to get the record album. Being 1976,  vinyl was all the choices we had. Everyone I knew had this album. When CD's came into view, this was one of the first to be bought again. Same thing when the remaster came out....I gave the first CD to my 17 year old son, who also is now a Frampton fan.
0375758992|4.0|I found that I could not put this book down.  I have long been interested in and even lived in Africa and found this to be one of the most engrossing books I have read in a long time.
0553801473|1.0|First off, thanks to HBO for turning many (myself included) onto this series.  The first three books are *amazing* and it's an enormous shame the two most recent additions are of such poor stock -this one especially.  I'm beginning to wonder if there is a Lucas-esque curse going around the scifi & fantasy genre where any works proceeding an epic first three are better-off ignored or completely forgotten.  Ironically Martin has several write-ups discussing Lucas on his \\"Not A Blog\\" (along with many more discussions of various merchandizing opportunities) yet he appears to be completely unaware of this disease's progress across his own body of work.<br /><br />I'm very surprised such an experienced writer could reverse course so quickly.  We've gone from a tight, powerful story that was focused around meaningful action to pages upon pages (upon pages) describing food, bowel movements and clothing.  Martin winks at his readers so often with shout-outs like \\"you know nothing ...\\", \\"broke their fast\\", \\"it is known\\", etc. you'd think he has become stricken with a literary nervous twitch.<br /><br />All this could be forgiven if Dance had made even a handful of meaningful plot advancements but the Song of Ice and Fire has practically ground to a halt.  We have pages and pages of characters doing things that have little to no impact on the overall story or which could be summarized for the sake of moving said story along.  But these books now appear to have little to nothing to do with purposeful plot and more to everything to do with building a merchandizing empire.  We might not see another book until 2016 but in the meantime we can drown ourselves in Game of Thrones miniatures, replica swords and video games ... blech.<br /><br />Two last bits:<br /><br />- Tyrion appears to have been replaced with someone else.  Gone are the great lines, come-backs and general wit that made many (myself included) fall in-love with a dwarf.  Perhaps a blow to the head in that wine barrelcaused permanent damage, we'll never know.  R.I.P. Tyrion, I don't know what doppelganger replaced you but you no longer talk, act or think like the character I grew to know and love.<br />- The Monty Python reference, \\"I fart in your general direction,\\" made me want to throw this book out a window.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use plenty of apps but this one has been the most useful app. The key feature for me is the ability to skip a recurring alarm before it goes off. Its also very easy to navigate.
B005P68PCY|5.0|Missed the episode on Friday and was so bummed. Was looking for when it might reply or be on internet and couldn't find anything until today. Stumbled across it on Amazon, didn't even know they sold or rented tv episodes. Was worried about watching it online while it downloaded cause I have had so much issues with lagging while watching stuff online. Not a bit of a problem at all, got so soley focus on the episode and the picture quality from the HD version was AWESOME!! Thanks Amazon!!   Thankful Supernatural  Fan :)
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I love Opeth.  When they released \\"Damnation\\", the mellow twin of the contemporaneously recorded and ulta heavy  \\"Deliverance\\", they tried to break out of the death metal typecasting.  Their music has fused 70's British folk (Nick Drake), Black Sabbath and the \\"Gothenburg\\" sound with the growling vocals. They have layered in classical guitar, middle eastern motifs,  jazz interludes and layered, hypnotic soundscapes to amazing effect.  Their music is truly original and unmatched.  It is accordingly not surprising that they would need to grow beyond the limits of death metal to showcase their virtuosity.  True artists go beyond the boundaries of genre.  Unfortunately, fans are not always able to accept and appreciate such change.  Hence, the mixed reviews here.  Personally, I love a band that can have such range from soft and emotive to bone jarringly heavy.  Unique, original and fearless: qualities this band and this album extoll.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Since Persistence of Time, Anthrax has been up and down for me.  I didn't hate John Bush, but I didn't think that era was particularly good.  Worship Music is everything it promises and more.  Joey's voice sounds like Anthrax in their prime.  The songs have a great balance and manage to avoid sounding dated.  Every listen of this gets better and better.  I wouldn't put this in the speed metal category, but it has its fast moments.  Most of it is more on the thrash and power metal vibe.  I can't encourage you enough to purchase this if you are a fan.  I really wasn't expecting Worship Music to be this good.  However, they proved they still have it, and hope they continue making great music for years to come.
0670022411|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best of this genre I have ever read.  I've just spent two days of non-stop reading, except for a nap now and then when my eyes needed a rest.  My only regret is that I cannot jump to Book Two immediately! I sincerely .. SINCERELY ... hope its publishing is in the VERY near future ..
B001UV4XHY|5.0|the product arrived on time, and played wonderfully, thank you for the prompt service. Would likely purchase from you again. This was purchased as a birthday gift for my friend. Thanks again.
B0052GVGYG|5.0|It was a sheer delight to see this act live at a small intimate amphitheater in Council Bluffs, Iowa (Located east of Omaha, split by the Missouri river).  They were touring for this CD and the show was great.<br /><br />I was also blessed with my first time seeing Derek Trucks playing with The Allman Brothers band a few years earlier.  The other guitarist was Warren Haynes.  Not one lick was missed with these two.  Just as good as Duane and Dickey Betts.<br /><br />Southern Rock (a fusion of rock, gospel and deeply inspired blues) will continue into the twenty first century with a few younger bands that keep coming around.  If they keep dusting off the sound, listeners will continue buying.<br /><br />Thanks Buzz, for the early anniversary present!

B003D0ZNM4|4.0|Indeed, this album does cover some of the very best of Part's music. I recommended that Part's music fans should have this in their music library.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Travis Rice and his crew did it again. They are the same people that did That's it That's All which is the greatest snowboard video I've ever seen. This one is almost tied with it though. The only reason I think That's it That's All is just a little better is because it just seemed a little more epic. The Art of Flight is still epic in its own though. The only thing I didn't like is how much failed locations they had although this does give you the perspective of what they have to go through to get those shots in those amazing locations. Its not always going to be top notch conditions. If you ride you know what thats like. That aside the cinematography is amazing. So much detail. The lengths they go through to ride the best places in the word just shows how much dedication this crew has. I first watched this on Zune on Xbox, after seeing it I just had to have it. Can't wait to get so I can watch it again and again. I recommend this movie to any snowboarder, even if you aren't I still think you would enjoy this movie.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Enlisting a string of stars that almost equals the \\"Who's Who\\" of current pop scene aces, the still young-at-heart Tony Bennett (*1926) gets the best of the bulk, making them the Great American Songbook crooners. The result is an album that (also with the help of social network fan pages) can go miles in bringing this type of music to the ears of fans of stars like Carrie Underwood, Lady GaGa or John Mayer. And although not each song is a blaring success, the album as a whole may become - at least commercially - one of signore Bennett's best.  1. The collection starts with Lady GaGa (like Bennett, also of an Italian descent) more than holding her own against him in the Rodgers/Hart classic \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\". She sounds like great fun, sporting accents and having no vocal problems whatsoever.  2. Relaxed and smooth is \\"One For My Baby\\" with John Mayer (who goes Yes, Sir, at the beginning), although the impression is not that lasting, either.  3. Amy Winehouse duet \\"Body and Soul\\" comes as a surprise, with the late British R&B diva's singing bordering on assured and careless at once. Yet, she is feeling the tune on a level (and, yes, voice) similar to the great Billie Holiday. This is also a song which fuelled the initial great sales of the album, being published two months after Amy's untimely death.   4. Duke Ellington's \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\" featuring Michael Buble is a standard fare, oft-recorded by Bennett and profesionally taken on by Michael.  5. Very tender is the version of Bobby Vinton-famed \\"Blue Velvet\\" with k.d.lang, the artists taking their time in unraveling the delicate mood of the song.  6. Aretha Franklin sounds fresh and strong on \\"How Do You Keep the Music Playing\\", although the two singers go a little bit over the top toward the end of the tune.  7. Almost unrecognizable, but beautiful - this is how Sheryl Crow sounds on Gershwin's seminal \\"The Girl I Love\\". Bennett answers her in a third person, adding yet another fresh hue to the old musical poem.  8. Country legend Willie Nelson and Tony live it all up \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\\" - like a bit of fresh air from the old buddies.  9. Former rapper Queen Latifah, still relatively new to the traditional pop realm, sounds relaxed and self-confident on \\"Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)\\", Tony here benevolently lets her vocals shine through.  10. Playful, peaceful and smooth as silk - that's the way Norah Jones treats another favorite Bennett fare, \\"Speak Low\\". As usual, she sounds like she was born to sing the material.  11. Crossover star Josh Groban brings his operatic ambitions to \\"This Is All I Ask\\", although his versatility should get still better with time.  12. A small swing intermezzo \\"Watch What Happens\\" follows with Natalie Cole, without which any duet album of this kind would be   almost unimaginable.  13. Operatic voice of Andrea Bocelli sounds a little tame on \\"Stranger in Paradise\\", however, this subtle approach works rather well in this setting.  14. Country diva Faith Hill uses the opportunity to popularize \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" (first sung by Fred Astaire to Ginger Rogers in 1936's movie Swing Time) to the limit, the spare arrangement at the beginning flourishes later in the song.  15. Spanish is added to the mix with Alejandro Sanz-featured \\"Yesterday I Heard the Rain\\", and it is welcome indeed, as otherwise the album at this later stage might well slip into the background for a casual listener.  16. Carrie Underwood is unusually understated on the penultimate song of the album, which is a good thing. However, Bennett's long-time favorite \\"It Had To Be You\\" (G.Kahn/I.Jones) is a wonderful song almost in any version.  17. And so comes the final track, \\"When Do the Bell Ring for Me\\" with Mariah Carey, recorded when she was expecting twins and so it had Tony joking there were actually four people singing. Carey's trademark girlish crooning is here. A future direction for her career? Who knows.  What we DO know is that \\"Duets II\\" is indispensable for Bennett's fans, collectors of Amy Winehouse work and mostly a good enrichment of any traditional pop music library, offering new fresh twist mainly in the work of GaGa, Winehouse, Crow, Jones, Sanz and Carey. Furthermore, it can bring to ears of the youngsters the idea of how beautiful songs were once written. This is the recording's legacy -  and mission.
B00004RI2S|5.0|This is for the Japanese-made 'XRCD' 20bit K2 version.  Judging by all the other reviews I've read everywhere, this disc is one of the most beloved recordings in all of jazz music. It is a \\"MUST HAVE\\" to go along with 'Sunday at the Village Vanguard' as both were recorded on the same wonderful Sunday - June 25, 1961 when all the planets must have been in alignment and \\"magic\\" occured at the Village Vanguard in New York City!  This is music that can be listened to as extraordinary \\"background music\\" for 'classy' parties, studying, or just about any activity, and when you sit down and listen 'actively' (as if you were there that day at the 'Vanguard') you will find the music is worth listening to with ALL your attention. Simply, it's \\"sublime\\" and extraordinary, especially on this JVC 'XRCD' version - the most \\"natural sounding\\" CDs I've ever experienced since Compact Discs appeared in the early '80s! The brushes on the cymbals and drumskins are so well reproduced that it sounds like an 'audiophile' record - there is NO \\"harshness\\" at all, and even the slightly \\"hot\\" recording level on the piano in some places goes by without a 'wince' from me. I never thought I'd say that about any CDs, but JVC's fanatical attention to materials and EVERY detail wrest the absolute finest reproduction from this medium.  Seemingly 'out-of-print' these 'XRCD' discs from JVC are becoming extremely rare and very pricey for used ones. It took me three months to find an \\"affordable\\" used copy with daily searches online at numerous sites. But I did finally find one and despite the relatively high price, find it totally worthwhile - it's simply the finest-sounding CD version there is of this wonderful music!  Another easy 5 STARS!!!!! Most highly recommended (despite the price)!!!!!
1594744769|5.0|I am not usually drawn to  books of this type.  I am older and generally like biographies, non fiction and some fiction.  I was drawn to this book simply by the cover.  The little girl levitating was difficult to avoid in the bookstore. When I flipped through the copy in the store I was amazed at the other photos and wondered how these were connected to the story.  The story did not disappoint.  What a creative mind this author has.  As I read I couldn't wait to turn to the next page to find yet another very odd photo of one of the characters.  Some of them were rather frightening too, but that added to the suspense of the book.  I don't think this book is receiving the attention it deserves and I am hoping some creative force in Hollywood will translate this to the screen.  I would love to see these characters come to life.  I have an e reader and would have never considered buying this in any other format than paper.  I look forward to more writing from Mr. Ransom Riggs...even his name is peculiar to me.  Loved this book.  I appreciate the great price Amazon offered on this book too.

1934030554|4.0|Great book for understanding and building a power training schedule. This book really helped me understand the significance of data from my Powertap. Its nice seeing data from different skill levels and sample training programs.  The books only detractor is its persistence in citing the authors' Cycling Peaks software package, but most texts dealing with analysis have similar problems (ie: numerical analysis books focused on Matlab coding).

B005IU1OMA|3.0|Why would Brain Farm, Red Bull, Travis & Co go through the trouble of releasing what feels like a half-finished package?  Travis Rice is my favorite snowboarder in the world, but his name has been tarnished by this release.  I understand there are time and funding constraints, but why not take an extra season and actually capture some snowboarding footage?   Instead we get, \\"Welcome to Country A. Oh damn, we can't ride here. Welcome to Country B. Oh damn, can't ride here either. Welcome back to Country A. One run? Let's do it.\\"  The main reason I, or anyone I know, watches TITA is to get amped to ride. This movie didn't excite me as much as it frustrated me.  I wanted to love this release, and odds are it will grow on me, but it's no TITA.
B00014NE62|5.0|Turner Classic Movies recently did a Merchant & Ivory film retrospective that included \\"Maurice.\\" I can't remember the last time I saw this movie, but when I recently saw it again on TCM, I fell absolutely in love with it again. That last scene between Maurice and Alec Scudder in the 'Boat 'ouse' (the way Scudder pronounced it) would melt any romantic's heart and soul. It would be great to explore what happened to the couple after they expressed their devotion to each other: Where did they end up living? How did Scudder adjust to his new life, as well as Maurice? Did they stay together until death? Did their families know and how did they react?
0670022411|5.0|I am a junkie for any novel weaves science and history into a really good story.  A reader can tell whether an author has a superficial/pop cluture knowledge base (ie. all the recent abundance of Jefferson novels) and an author who has a schloarly ease with facts to use in their story. I loved the way the story takes you slowly, establishing the back stories.  While it ends leaving you wanting more. I am willing to wait for a sequel that leads me through history and the cluture of creatures in our mist.
0316154687|5.0|David's talents are best expressed through books.  I took a friend to see him live in San Diego and in the book signing phase before the show he was a total jerk.  Very disappointing.  The show was equally disappointing.  He clearly does not have the perforfance charisma of that of his sister Amy, who outshines on screen.<br /><br />David does shine in print.  It's best to keep this literary wallflower up in the attic where he can churn out his quirky humor without being egregiously offensive to the fans that keep his bread buttered.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol is a great band with a great set of lyrics and sound to back them up. Their debut album, like many other great bands, define there sound sonically. It's got some darkness but it's also got some light. It deserves nothing less than five stars, period.

B000244FDW|4.0|I am totally in love with all things Pride and Prejudice and am just starting to realize how many films and book variations are out there.  I have now seen 3 movies. The Matthew MacFadyen, Colin Firth and David Rintoul as Darcy versions.  All have their postives and their negatives.  I can't tell you which is best.  I love them all.  I will say that you must watch them all and judge for yourself.  They all bring something different to the screen and put together you get a full enjoyment of the novel.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|The first time I saw this book, I told myself that this wasn't for me. I don't like the cover at all. This is something I don't usually pick from the shelf. But after my friends talked about it, I decided to give it a try. I was so curious to see what they've been blabbing about: who's Travis? who's Pigeon? Who's Jamie McGuire? These questions have been answered the time I finished this engrossing book.<br /><br />Who's Travis? He's Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox--the smart and bad... the sexy and bad... the strong and bad... the sweet and bad... I might be exaggerating, but yes, he's the bad yet the sweetest guy you'll ever meet in this book. You'll love him!<br /><br />Who's Pigeon? she's the girl the Travis fell in love with over and over again. He's tough, but this girl's tougher. Travis is strong, but what happens when he finally meet his weakness? You have to find out for yourself...<br /><br />From the time I started reading Beautiful Disaster I was hooked. I read it even during the times that my eyes were so tired to stay open. If I wasn't so busy, I could have finished this book immediately. I like the characters the author created--from Travis, Abby, Shepley, America, and Finch... up to the Maddox loud boys... Though there are times that I get annoyed with Abby, it doesn't lessen the enjoyment especially when Travis was there. I admire America--it would be amazing to have a friend like her. She's so loyal and she's willing to give up anything... and anyone for Abby.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, but not the occasional use of obscene words that made me skipped them from time to time... I didn't like the use of God's name in any conversation and that made me so uncomfortable. The story contains so much complications, thus unhealthy relationships are so prominent. I didn't like the the environment, but the story was really good. For me, reading this book is like a roller coaster ride from the beginning to end. There was no dull moment and there are lots of steamy ones.<br /><br />And so, who's Jamie McGuire? She's no other than the talented author of Beautiful Disaster.e's no other than the talented author of Beautiful Disaster.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Mile 81 is a boarded up rest stop in Maine forgotten by many except for high school kids looking for a place to party. When ten year old Pete Simmons explores the rest stop he finds a bottle of vodka and drinks enough to pass out. He wakes up to a living nightmare - a car that eats people.<br /><br />\\"Mile 81\\" starts off a bit slowly with the introduction of Pete Simmons but once the flesh easting car comes into the picture it becomes a tension filled short story. A possessed car is nothing new for Stephen King which he openly acknowledges with nods to [[ASIN:0451160444 Christine (Signet)]] and [[ASIN:0743417682 From a Buick 8]] (\\"Mile 81\\" is not as good as the former but much better than the latter) and it is not the type of plot you want to think too much about (like where did the car come from and why does it need to eat humans). Instead, sit back and enjoy what King does best - create characters that you care about no matter how briefly you meet them. Ironically, while much of the story is focused around the heroics of young children, none of them comes across very realistically. Pete is a bit too knowledgeable for a ten year old and Rachel is far too mature a six year old when faced with danger. What worked for me were the adult characters, especially Julianne and Trooper Jimmy (who make you wish you could reach inside the Kindle and pull them away from the car). As for the car itself - yes it is a bit creepy but it is also King's take (as only King could do) on the perils of stopping to help a stranger who just may be a homicidal maniac.<br /><br />\\"Mile 81\\" may not be King's best short story but it is still a heck of a ride and King fans will also enjoy the sneak preview of his next novel [[ASIN:1451627289 11/22/63: A Novel]].

B00080ZG10|5.0|This is a terrific movie. And I'm glad Scorcese did it.  The cast is perfect for the story. I won't go into the details as others have done just as well as I could. But let me add this: As a former employee of Hughes Aircraft, I know the movie makers did their homework thoroughly because they referred to the names of the various Hughes companies using the inside names Hughes employees did. For example, Hughes Tool Company in Houston (which bankrolled all of Hughes' projects) is referred to in the movie as 'ToolCo'. That is exactly the way it was referred to by veteran Hughes employees.  I certainly hope that director, cast and crew will finish the job with a sequel  taking Hughes' life to the end.   One scene from the movie is especially priceless to any Californian: When Hughes  tells Noah Dietrich, during the shooting of Hell's Angels, to incorporate a new company called Hughes Aircraft in California, Dietrich responds;  'But Howard, you can't do that. There are serious tax implications with incorporating in California.'  So even in the late 1920's, California was known as a lousy place to set up a business.

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I'm really enjoying Lady Antebellum's new album.  Favorite songs:  \\"We Owned the Night\\", \\"Just A Kiss\\", \\"When You Were Mine\\" and \\"As You Turn Away\\".  Great vocals and a nice balance of upbeat songs and ballads.  Highly recommend!
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I am writing to report that I was very satisfied with this company. They sent the CD on time and I have been enjoy it. The quality is great. I will buy CDs and other products from them in the future. Trust me they keep their promise.

B001LMU182|1.0|Some of the voices have been redone and lines changed. I quit watching as soon as I noticed that it wasn't the original. My Blue-ray disc copy will become a Christmas present for family and my VHS copy just became more valuable to me.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|One of the MOST anticipated Blu Ray release of all time is finally here.  We've all seen it numerous times and every media outlet imaginable has either quoted it or used it as a hook for our attention.  Why does it get our attention?  Because it is one of those films that has an in depth fantastic world with clear defined lines of good and evil, backed with a powerful plot filled with likable and detestable characters.  Most of all it's so much fun to watch, because no matter what age you are it brings the kid inside of you alive.     Alive is what you will feel when viewing these Blu Rays.  These Blu Rays are by far the most impressive I have ever seen of an older movie restored, many times unbelievable was the word that came to mind.  Picture quality on all three films is crisp and clear, the best they have ever looked and then some.  The light sabres glow with intensity, Darth Vaders helmet shines with mirror like blackness and certain scene details come to life for the first time.  Several times I found myself looking at the characters detailed surroundings instead of the character themselves.  The picture quality on all three films has been so thoroughly examined there are not any moments where you wish they could have done more in any particular scene.  The picture quality is simply amazing and your eyes will be glued to the screen with the dynamic DTS HD Master Audio mix that draws you in with its dynamic use of the sound field.    The picture quality is amazing, but the DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack is in one word AWESOME. If ever you wanted to be immersed into the Star Wars universe this soundtrack will leave you awestruck. Star Destroyers rumble the scene as they pass over, Tie fighters scream from the rears to the fronts as they fly over and fight scenes come alive like an actual war is taking place in your media room.  AT-ATs, Speeder Bikes, Darth Vader's voice...I could go on and on about this unbelievable soundtrack.  Sound is so important to bringa movie to life and Lucas spared nothing on this soundtrack to give these classics a new dynamic feel.    Overall, a MUST buy for any Star Wars fan.  These films have never looked or sounded better then they do in this aweinspiring release.  I am going to go out on a limb and say this is by far the best Blu Ray release of the year.  Do not fall into what so many have already done and not buy because of additions to the \\"original\\" theatrical version.  These additions are minor and do nothing to the overall enjoyment you will feel when watching these films in HD.  I encourage everyone to do what I did and buy these films and watch them for the first time, you will be amazed at all that HD has done for these films.  Amazon has an incredible price, highly recommended.
B004SGWYW4|2.0|I feel so ripped off by this DVD purchase. For the price most collections give you a whole lot more. This you just get 2 DVD's in a flimsy plastic case and that's it. No real extras,no art cards, no slip cover, no nothing! For such a fun and great series they should be ashamed of themselves. This \\"complete\\" collection doesn't do this series justice at all. As much as this \\"collection\\" costs I expected a lot more. I've paid less for other series and they put out collections really worth buying.<br /><br /> Lets all be honest here, as fans of anime when you buy a series you're obviously doing so because you really enjoyed the show. Of course it be nice if they threw in extra perks with these collections to make it feel like it's a purchase worth your while. With the option of watching shows streamed online anytime what reason would there be to buy DVD or Blue Ray? You would think these companies figured out people that buy the DVD's want more from it. Other wise this is just a cheap DVD case, some throw away art and 2 disks. That's ALL YOU GET! My favorite character isn't even on the front cover she's on the back! What is this!

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Another coup for Moore.  The insurance industry sic'ed their exec Wendell Potter on this film to slander it and smear Michale Moore and came away saying \\"what can I say, I know it's true\\" (see his memoirs or interview on Amy Goodman Demoracy Now).  Must see for all Americans.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was unusually disturbed when a certain tribute died, so I can certainly say the characters and story were engrossing. I just didn't like that Katniss became increasingly irrelevant. Without her, would Mockingjay have unfolded much differently? I thought events would mercilessly forge her into a little general, a leader of the rebellion, a sci-fi Che Guevara, but instead she spent most of the book cowering or recuperating. I also didn't like that many of the best scenes happened off-camera.
B005KCTQSK|4.0|Glad I got this UK repackaged version of Lights from Ellie Goulding. It has more tracks than the US release. 17 tracks in total. Save a bit by getting it through Amazon UK. I love all the singles like Guns & Horses, Starry Eyed, The Writer and the Elton John cover, Your Song. But the supposed filler tracks are great as well. An enjoyable release from beginning to end.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I downloaded this game this weekend and played for pretty much every minute I had available since (only like 3-4 hours). This is intense in that it is a real-time game (as frantic as a game like Diner Dash) that requires a reasonable amount of strategy. The graphics are good on my Acer A500, it is the first game that I feel like I wanted to play on my new tablet (got it August 24, 2011). Have not \\"finished it\\" so I don't know how long but I highly recommend the purchase.
1934137197|2.0|Imagine being sat in front of a favorite meal and being made to eat it until you vomited.  Or biting into a delicious peach and being forced to chew it a thousand times.  Or reading this book.<br /><br />It's not so much a story for the reader as a vehicle for the writer to practice self indulgence.  If one descriptive paragraph is good, then ten more about the same scene or situation should be very compelling indeed.  The work is full of needless metaphors and simple nonsense.  Protagonists and viewpoints change randomly for no reason.<br /><br />If a writer's cleverness frustrates his reader, it's not clever.  It is often an excuse for laziness or insecurity or both.<br /><br />The word craft is good.  And the lie that is The Good Old Days is exposed.  Genuinely interesting issues and perspectives about the continuum of humanness are raised.  And-then-beaten-to-death.<br /><br />The book is needlessly overdone.  It would be a fraction of its current size and a compelling short story or novella if every unnecessary word was removed.  As it is, it is beyond boring and is moreover, pedantically presumptuous.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I recently picked up this dvd and let me tell you, that the action was pretty good.  I knew that Stane (one of the supporting characters) was going to be a nasty dude from the word go since I have the book of Iron Man's adventures.  If you have yet to see the movie, but read the guide which could probably be found in any bookstore like barnes and noble (I can't believe I just recommended this) go for this flick, you will not be disappointed.

034552554X|5.0|When emotions are too raw, flowers become a catalyst for expression. Foster child Victoria, abandoned as an infant, shuttled from foster home to foster home until she is 9 years old. At 9 she becomes the foster daughter of Elizabeth, a grape farmer. Isolated from the world herself, Elizabeth pulls Victoria into her `family' in the hopes of adoption.<br />Flowers and their language is a skill Elizabeth teaches Victoria over the course of the next year.<br />Victoria learns and takes in so much that when she is released from the foster care system at age 18 she eventually finds herself back with flowers, working for a florist named Renata.<br />Excelling in her knowledge of flowers and their expression of emotion, Victoria begins to make a name for herself in the floral world. Victoria continues to struggle with her own sense of belonging and self-worth that follows her in a relationship with Grant. Unable to express herself, Grant and Victoria begin a flower dictionary of expressions.<br />Fears of not knowing how to belong, of feeling inadequate causes Victoria to jeopardize her own happiness. Will she be able to pull out of herself and find the love she deserves?<br />Amazing look into the depth of flowers and a creation of a floral dictionary, detailed with their origin and meanings. I had never given much thought to the depth flowers could express, depth of emotion when our uncertainties make our words unavailable.<br />Great focus on the foster care system and the need for programs to integrate these 18 year olds into adulthood, into a society where they can feel they finally belong.<br />Told with heart and deep emotions, both verbal and through flowers.<br />Unique and Powerful!

B0034G4P7Q|4.0|It's ironic that I manage most of my company's social media channels, and only tonight did I get around to watching \\"The Social Network.\\" I thought it was a very good movie about how the global phenomenon that is Facebook originated at Harvard University. This is more than just the story of a successful business launch, however. It also chronicles the way Facebook destroyed the friendship between its two co-founders.<br /><br />I thought \\"The Social Network\\" was a very smart movie, but I was expecting a bit more, probably due to all the hype that surrounded the film upon its release. It's not a bad movie in any sense, but it's not a movie I'd ever take the time to watch again. Still, Facebook addicts will surely get a kick out of it.

0439023521|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read and I've read a lot a lot of books. It's  boring and i wouldn't advise anyone to read it. The only reason I was able to get myself through the whole thing was by reminding myself that my friends wouldn't listen to my opinion unless I finished it. The plot is not good and it is not written well. Also, the characters have no real personality and the books have no flavor. For some reason a lot of people like it which seems strange to me.     It's basically about a bunch of kids that are thrown into an arena somewhere in the woods and they have to kill each other while everyone else watches on t.v.- the last person left standing wins. So this girl gets chosen to compete one year along with another boy from her district and they pretend to be in love so that the people will root for them and in the end they are both allowed to survive. The boy really loves the girl but she's not sure if she feels the same way about him because she likes another boy back home too. I didn't bother to read the rest of the series but from what i know about the other two books, the girl is in love with both of the boys and can't decide so finally she chooses the one that competed with her in the 'hunger games' because she find out the other one helped blow her little sister up for some reason.    I don't even know why they're bothering to make a movie out of this piece of trash- that love triangle idea has been used way too much and the killing part- well, I guess no one's bothered to try that till now.     I have never read such a stupid book. (I didn't want to even put one star but they said I had to rate it...) All my friends said, \\"it sounds stupid but it's not\\" but after reading it i realized that it sounds stupid because it is stupid. Anyone who thinks otherwise is just kidding themselves- they realize it deep down and if someone disagrees with me; don't bother to comment on this review and if you do- I don't care, I'm not even bothering to check,I'm just sharing this with whoever is interested because this is my opinion, no matter what anyone else thinks... and I'm proud of it:)

0446691437|1.0|no chance this book gets published if it was not written by a famous author.  it's just churned out crap written to get a paycheck.  i see no effort put out by the author.  the first 1/3rd of this book was little more than an extremely long-winded religious rant written in the wake of 9/11 attacks.  after that i can't even describe it.  the author is way too old to have an imaginary friend, and he has a LOT of imaginary friends.  he could not go more than a couple pages without remarking about angels, god or muses.  he's truly an idiot.  i got absolutely nothing out of this book.  this ties for the worst book i have ever read.
B004EPZ0BG|2.0|Spoiler warning.  The leads are charming, but the story lacks depth and is totally predictable. And worst of all, flash mob on movies simply doesn't work, let alone twice. Flash mob is cool in real life, but in movies it's just a cliche, because in movies people burst into songs and dances all the time, been done a thousand times before.
B003L77FYS|5.0|- Castle: \\"How did she die?\\"<br />- Lanie the medical examiner: \\"Stabbed in the back of the neck with an ice pick and then stuffed into the sofa.\\"<br />- Castle: \\"So she didn't see that coming.\\"<br /><br />After eyeballing the hi-tech crime-solving equipment seen in shows like 24 and BONES, there's a cool, old-school quaintness to Detective Kate Beckett's murder board. To sort of piggyback on that observation, sometimes you can have all the fancy bells and whistles, but if you don't have that core foundation of a good cast with terrific chemistry, then you ain't got diddles. Regarding the palpable heat generated by Stana Katic and the awesomely awesome Nathan Fillion, only Boreanaz and Deschanel have got them beat. And shallow guy that I am, I admit that Stana Katic coming in to Season 3 with longer hair makes her look even more stunning. It's also nice to see her Detective Beckett loosening up and having more fun this season. You can only do \\"icy\\" so much.<br /><br />Bestselling mystery novelist Rick Castle must have some kind of pull with New York City's mayor, because he's still going on extended ride alongs with the 12th Precinct, still in the inner circle of the 12th's best homicide detectives, still offering his outside-the-box insights on gruesome murders. Castle's writer's block - which is what led him to his association with NYPD - is long over. Castle has produced two recent best-sellers featuring Nikki Heat, his latest character and based on Detective Kate Beckett. You and me, we know Castle is only sticking around because of Beckett. And, really, with mad respect to Detectives Ryan and Esposito, two fantastic supporting characters, it's Castle and Beckett's interactions that keep me coming back. The homicide cases are occasionally intriguing, but nothing I can't find in other police procedurals. I do like Castle's relationship with his very wise 17-year-old daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn, wonderful). Even if I feel that sometimes, thematically, Castle's domestic complications seem to parallel the murder of the week too often. But Alexis, this season, lands a steady boyfriend, giving Castle a whole new set of headaches.<br /><br />The humor is great, the banter flows naturally. I love the meta-touches, such as Castle promoting his Nikki Heat books and the Derrick Storm graphic novel (all of which actually now exist) and Castle's poker nights with fellow writers such as Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, and the late Stephen J. Cannell (and I love the touching tribute the show pays to Cannell). And, not to flaunt my nerdiness, but did you also catch Fillion's nod to FIREFLY in the episode \\"Close Encounters of the Murderous Kind\\"?<br /><br />Mulling over Season 3, stream-of-consciousness style: Feuding pizza shops. Murder on a soap opera set. A treasure hunt solved by MAD magazine. The validation of a medium. There's even a vic what gets killed by a 200-year-old bullet, to which Castle remarks: \\"Two hundred year old bullet can only mean one thing... Time traveling killer.\\" But, as good as those episodes are, they aren't the cream of the crop.<br /><br />But these are: The cat-and-mouse \\"3XK\\" episode has Beckett's team tangling with the notorious Triple Killer. \\"Nikki Heat\\" guest stars Laura Prepon (That '70s Show) as the actress cast in the film role of Nikki Heat, and this fun episode finds her tagging along with Beckett and Castle on a case. In Season 2's \\"Sucker Punch,\\" Beckett was forced to kill the hitman who had murdered her mother before she could learn who ordered the hit. Season 3's \\"Knockdown\\" has Beckett following up another lead in her mother's murder. Adrian Pasdar plays a tautly wired Homeland Security agent in a two-parter (\\"Setup\\" & \\"Countdown\\") which has the team frantically combing New York City for a dirty bomb set to explode in mere hours. \\"To Love and Die in L.A.\\" has Beckett and Castle taking a trip to Los Angeles to conduct an unsanctioned investigation. (We also get a chance to see Stana Katic in swimwear, so there are no losers here.) In the explosive season finale, \\"Knockout,\\" Beckett makes more headway into the conspiracy behind her mother's murder, but the cost is the gut-wrenching death of a regular supporting character and a suspenseful cliffhanger.<br /><br />It's no coincidence that these episodes are compelling because they feature a more emotionally-invested cast of characters. And, like all savvy television shows, CASTLE knows how to tease the audience, almost getting the boyish writer and the distant cop together, but then wrenching them apart. You need that element of pining. Season 3 has Castle reuniting with his ex-wife and publicist, while Kate Beckett hooks up with a dashing, motorcycle-riding surgeon. But we realize that these are temporary barriers, and don't pose near the threat to our two leads getting together that Beckett's damaged psyche does. I like the crime-solving bits. But the show's not about that.<br /><br />Bonus features:<br /><br />- Cast & Crew Commentary for 2 episodes, except I'll only mention the cast: \\"A Deadly Affair\\" (with Nathan Fillion) and \\"3XK\\" (with Seamus Dever &  Jon Huertas)<br />- Deleted Scenes (and plenty of 'em)<br />- \\"Murder They Wrote\\" - a round table discussion with creator/exec. producer of CASTLE Andrew Marlowe, exec. producer Rob Bowman, mystery writer Michael Connelly, comic book writer Brian Michael Bendis, and Nathan Fillion (00:22:00 minutes long)<br />- \\"CASTLE Goes Hollywood\\" - Behind the Scenes of shooting the \\"To Die and Love in L.A.\\" episode (00:07:58 minutes)<br />- Bloopers (00:04:12)<br />- \\"Murder Boards\\" - Propman Kurt DeFilipps explains the process of producing Beckett's murder boards (00:03:22)<br />- \\"Get On The Floor\\" Music Videowimwear, so there are no losers here.)

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have grown up with Star Wars.  I watched the originals on cable growing up (I was still in diapers when they first hit the big screen).  I went to the theaters opening night as the original three episodes were remastered in 1997.  I caught each of the three new episodes via midnight premiers over the past decade.  I was so happy to finally have a chance to upgrade my collection from VHS to DVD and now finally to Blu Ray.  The color and sound are spectacular and worth owning for any Star Wars fan.  The boxed set itself is packaged in a nice little photo album styled sleeves that is beautiful to look at.  I look forward to a day where each of the various director cuts (original, remastered and Blu Ray) are available together in the same set, to give the viewer a chance to experience each of the various releases and era associated with them.  However until that day comes, this is the best version in circulation and is a must own!

I learned a lot of things.She was not an ordinary student in terms of her enthusiasm  and passion. She was outstanding.She got a lot of F on her grades.But she was passionate about her life. She found her enthusiasm about animals. At first,she got a lot of rejections. Nobody believed she would be something.She fought against sexism and prejudice.Finaly, she made it! I liked very beginnig  and the ending.In the beginning, She told us that she's \\"not like other people.\\" But \\"different\\" is not \\"less.\\" She is super-enthusiastic about her job.It is true she is different.This introduction was a summary of  her life.In the end of the story,I could see a lot of doors.Many,many people closed the doors to her.She could open the doors.The doors might be close.We can open it by our efforts.Sadly, many people gave up before they opened it. She made it! I recommend you to watch this movie.Especially , when you have some hardships.This movie will give you some idea how to over come your hardships.

1451629184|5.0|I purchased this book in a way hoping that Jaycee's story and her strength would help me recover from my own tragedy. My story is vastly different from hers, and not nearly as traumatic or life altering, but there were many times when I was reading this that I felt I could relate. The graphic detail was not shocking at all to me, but perhaps this is because I have also been on the receiving end of horrific abuse. I can see how other people might have trouble reading these parts of her story, but I think that it is important as an eye-opener to the reality of how twisted people can be. It is also important for those thinking about buying this book to realize that while certain parts of this book may be difficult to read, most of this story is just a processing of her emotions and how she dealt with what she went through. I think it shows incredible strength that she was willing and able to share her story with the world.<br /><br />If you are wondering how this may have helped me, I do not yet know. I literally just finished the book. But, it has reinforced my belief that if there really is a reason for all things, that the reason why such terrible things happened to me was so that I could become stronger, so that I could gain wisdom from my experiences, and so that I could help inform and heal others. This seems to be the same conclusion that Jaycee came to through her experiences, and seems to be part of the reason why she wanted to publish this book. For this I feel a sort of kinship with her that is comforting in a world where I so often feel so terribly alone.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|This Movie has an awesome cast which is really its strength point. Angeline Jolie and Johnny Depp in the lead, now who wouldn't want to see that ??<br /><br />However, that being said the movie is clearly not a life changing one. If you watched the trailer already you should know you won't be hearing about The Tourist in the next  Academy Oscar Awards. However, the trailer is a bit deceiving while this movie has *some* action scenes involved the action is very light. So, this isn't a mindless action film full of chasing cars, swashbuckling heroes, and flying motorbikes. It has all the elements necessary to make a typical action film (Hero/Heroine, Government and secret agents, spying, High tech spying supplies, Evil Gangs, the Bad Guys, Murder etc, etc..) But for some reason the movie doesn't focus on these elements entirely thus the action is rather lacking, action fans you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />What we get instead, is something else. If I can describe this film in one word it would \\"sweet\\". It has a sweet romance and some tender moments as a backstory. The Scenery is also a plus in here. You got a beautiful view once in a while of gorgeous European cities and being a travel freak I enjoyed that.<br /><br />I heard people complain about the lack of nudity in this film. I personally didn't mind that, I'm in no way a prude but I'm not a fan of mindless sex scenes and I didn't find a legitimate reason for the Hero/Heroine to have sex till about the last 5 minutes of the film.<br /><br />In the end I would give this a rent if for nothing else just to see Johnny Depp wandering in Italy trying to chase the woman he thinks he loves. Worth it ? I think so !

B0015F1VY8|2.0|After viewing this movie, I was greatly disappointed not just by the lack of historical accuracy but also by other things that are important for example the script, the filmography, the plot, the sets and most importantly the lack of action.<br /><br />In a matter of fact, when I think about it. I'm not exactly sure who is the target audience here, it's not history buffs, nor action lovers or fans of soap operas dramas. I am still confused as to what group of people I would recommend this movie.<br /><br />I don't normally give a movie 2 stars unless I had to and I tried to see some redeeming qualities to make up for my disappointment and eventually I did somehow for example the boat scene where Elizabeth is sitting with her ladies is beautiful for example albeit inappropriate (historically) for Tudor England and some other brief moments like the Spanish Armada sailing but that's it and quite frankly it wasn't enough to make me change my opinion after almost 2 hours of viewing<br /><br />Why precisely I give this 2 stars ?<br /><br />1-Historical Inaccuracies aside (I'll come to these in a moment) the directing was odd and made the film rather confusing. Jump Cuts, shots from odd angles and there was even a scene where Elizabeth was walking with her minsters and the camera decides to shoot that from the ceiling for no apparent reason.<br /><br />2-The customs, I know they are pretty and the colors are full of life and glee but aside from the ruffs (which aren't even accurate and resemble wires more than fabric) the dresses look more suitable for Venice rather then England. Another thing that bugged me was Cate Blanchette's hair style. While the real Elizabeth undoubtedly wore wigs (not to cover her bald hair like some people think but to cover grey hair and because wigs were in fashion) was it necessary to decorate it with feathers in almost every scene ? She looks like a peacock ! It's impossible.<br /><br />3-Manners and Behaviors, people didn't behave that way in Elizabethan England, they didn't talk that way either. The Script is very disappointing (I wasn't accepting something out of Shakespeare mind you) but at least something sophisticated enough and still understandable. The actors don't have a chance to shine because the script is so limited. In another scene Elizabeth the Queen is sitting on her throne while one of her ladies-in-waiting who is a dwarf no offense intended is sitting on her lap. Will the real Elizabeth or any Queen for that matter allow her lady in waiting dwarf or not to set on her lab in a public ceremony ? I just had to laugh at how ridicules that scene is! In another scene there is a feast and a group of painted performers came half naked (that wasn't the kind of entertainment at court that scene quite frankly fits more perfectly in Arabian Nights).<br /><br />4-Historical inaccuracies finally we are getting there !<br /><br />Elizabeth hated women (she trusted a few, including her governor Kat Ashley who was a mother to her and Dudley's sister who nursed her during small pox as well as another lady in waiting which name escapes me) as for the rest she hated them ! If you don't believe me read any biography about her. She broke a woman's finger once because she married secretly, she imprisoned another in the tower for the same reason, I wouldn't be surprise if she banished others too. She was all vicious to women while all charm to men. She preferred the company of men and was more comfortable with them and didn't make it a secret. So, for her to be running around with her ladies in waiting is untrue. She was a great flirt and surrounded herself with members of the opposite sex.<br /><br />There are many key figures missing in this movie. Where is Essex ? Where is Cecil ? Where is Drake ? And most importantly where is Robert Dudley ? (Queen Elizabeth's favorite who might or might not be her one true love) all is gone.<br /><br />By the time of the Armada Elizabeth wasn't entertaining any suitors. She was in her 5os, her ministers already knew she wouldn't get married as the possibility of an heir is no longer valid. Also, Elizabeth might be capable of Political Brutality almost like any other Politician however she was quite shaken by Mary Queen of Scots Execution. Or at least pretended to be Quite Shaken there is no emotion whatsoever shown in here. Even in that Kissing scene between Elizabeth and Raleigh she seems rather stiff while we know that she's a woman of Passion.<br /><br />Cate Blanchette is an excellent actress but I'm afraid that's not enough to save this movie. The dialogue, the inaccuracies, the gloomy gothic sets that are so dark it's impossible to see who's doing what at times. If you'll watch this film then let it be for pure entertainment not for History please. There is NO History to be learnt here if you want you can always pick a book or use Wikipedia.<br /><br />For a better adoption watch the Helen Mirren's version Elizabeth 2005. It's more accurate and the script is intelligent and witty.f an heir is no longer valid.

B00340I4KG|5.0|Director John Woo helms an action-packed suspense thriller starring John Travolta as an FBI agent and Nicolas Cage as a terrorist...or is it Nicolas Cage as the FBI agent and John Travolta as the terrorist? If you try not to think too much about that aspect of the movie, you're in for one sweet psychotic ride. This film could have been made several times over with different actors playing the lead roles (Harrison Ford/Michael Douglas, Alec Baldwin/Bruce Willis, Al \\"Michael Corleone\\" Pacino/Robert DeNiro, Jean Claude Van Damme/Steven Seagal, Arnold \\"The Terminator\\" Schwarzenegger/Sylvester Stallone) to excellent effect. I think that Kelly Preston should have been cast as John Travolta/Nicolas Cage's wife, as Joan Allen looks too much like Glenn Close in \\"Fatal Attraction.\\" SPOILERS ALERT!!! I really like the final scene, when Jamie is sisterly with Adam. So cute. Should have had them hug or something in addition to what happens in the scene. I also wish the writer or director had included a scene with Jamie and her brother, showing what their relationship was like before Castor took his life, albeit accidentally. SPOILERS OVER!!! Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13.

014241543X|4.0|\\"I'm not choosing, but I'm running out of fight\\"<br /><br />Mia's life is great.  She has loving parents, a sweet brother, a charming boyfriend, a dear friend, and a possible career as a Juilliard trained cellist.  But everything changes one February morning...and now she must make a heartwrenching decision.<br /><br />I've seen this novel popping up on my Goodreads friends' feeds, usually accompanied by 4 and 5 star reviews.  This made me intrigued.  I am not usually a big young adult contemporary novel reader (been there, done that, don't want to remember it), but this time I braved my prejudices and the atrocious \\"Will appeal to fans of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight\\" from USA Today (really, what is it with EVERYONE comparing any young adult novel with a hint of paranormal or romance to the Twilight series???) and took the plunge.<br /><br />This book is a breeze to read.  I didn't have much time over the weekend to finish it, but I STILL got it done in like four days.  The writing is clear, intelligent, yet realistic.  Mia's voice is that of a teenager--sure, a mature teenager, but a teenager none-the-less.  No endless uses of \\"chagrined\\" and \\"verbose\\", no weird sentence structure, just the nice, sweet, \\"plain\\" voice of a teenager.<br /><br />The other part of the novel that really appealed to me was its location.  This might be one of the ONLY books I've ever read that actually is located where I lived!  However, I'm realizing what many other have complained about: the Oregon in \\"If I Stay\\" doesn't bear that much resemblance to the Oregon I see every day.  I understand that the location isn't supposed to be a second character, that it wasn't the focus, but numerous times I paused and had to wonder.  Why is seeing Mount Hood an indication they are getting closer to Portland?  Where do Mia and her family live?  Coastal Oregon?  Down south closer to Salem and Eugene?  Or do they live in the dry West like in Redmond or Bend?  What mall does her mother take her to?  Washington Square?  Lloyd Center?  Pioneer Square?  To my knowledge Oregon doesn't have a \\"Rose Parade\\" on New Year's Day--that is sometime in June (replete with Oregon crappy weather).  Is the hospital OHSU?  Does Adam take Mia to Voodoo donuts then to the Waterfront (boy, that would be a bit of a walk!)?  Where do her grandparents live?  What is the university that they refer to?  Is it OSU, PSU, UofO, UofP, Pacific, Western Oregon?  Again, I know this isn't important, but I would like more of a shoutout than an occasional \\"Arlene Schnitzer\\" reference.<br /><br />But, that is a very minor pet peeve, and one that is unlikely to affect many other people (unless you are as neurotic or living in Portland like myself!).  The heart of the story and its characters are glowing.<br /><br />Mia, our protagonist, is a scintillating character, full of life, heart, and soul.  She is truly a unique character.  She isn't too smart, but a brilliant cellist.  She has a crazy family, whom she loves.  She has a good friend, whom she actually treats like a good friend.  She has a boyfriend, with whom she has a healthy relationship.  All these reasons make me wonder WHY USA Today calls this book good for fans of Twilight (just because Bella =/= Mia).<br /><br />The secondary characters are also very alive and unique.  Mia's parents are awesome!  You got to see how they grew up by having Mia, and yet how they are still \\"children at heart\\" (BTW this is how you include punk bands withOUT dragging the story down!!).  I love how Mia loves her little brother, Teddy, who is so charming and funny.  Adam is completely drool worthy.  I love how sentimental he is and how truly self-sacrifical he can be.  Kim is totally a friend I wish I had.  I love how she broke through her own reservations to let Adam know what happened.  And other characters--Henry and Willow, Gran and Gramps--all round out the cast to make this story come alive.<br /><br />And be prepared--the story may cause you to cry (if I hadn't been reading it on lunch, I would have probably bawled, and I do NOT cry over books!).  I really don't want to give too much away, but let me just say this: something bad happens and Mia has to make a choice.  As she contemplates her choice, she flips back to the past, to memories of her family, both good and bad.  We get to see a real true romance, instead of the insta-love romances populating so many novels today.  We get a young woman who LIKES being with her parents instead of some punk always WHINING about being with Mom and Dad.  We see Mia working through problems with friends and family, and doing so in a normal, natural way.  It was SO refreshing to see people who didn't overdramatize EVERYTHING.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that will tug at your heartstrings without playing with your emotions, if you are looking for real characters in real situations, if you are looking for a story that doesn't overdramatize everything (no Big Misunderstandings here!), then pick up this book and perhaps a few tissues.  It's a truly beautiful novel, and I can't wait to read the sequel!<br /><br />Oh, and if Fordman is looking for a Portland setting advisor, I AM HERE!!!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

030745455X|5.0|Larsson's storytelling doesn't miss a beat. This takes up just where he left off in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. A lot of loose ends from \\"Tattoo\\" are tied up.  The characters are now like old friends, and a few new people are introduced.<br /><br />There are short summaries and introductions so \\"Fire\\" can be read out of sequence, but those who don't read the first volume will miss the full development of the story and the depth of the principle players.<br /><br />I liked \\"Fire\\" is even better than the \\"Tattoo\\".  It's a page turner throughout.  It really moves with lots of intrigue and plots. Like \\"Tattoo\\", the main mystery is solved at the end, but not everything is resolved.  I'm ready for book 3.
B0058A119G|5.0|Not only are the husband/wife composer team brilliant lyricists and melody-makers, but I swear Miss Streisand's voice gets even better as she continues to mature, an emotional musical depth worth experiencing on a daily basis!
B002KE47Z8|5.0|An old friend told me that I must read Lahiri, and she was right. Lahiri's prose is clean and straightforward; her characters are carefully drawn and ring true to life; and her plots are thoughtful. Unlike many short stories these days, hers have a beginning, a middle, and an end.<br /><br />Her depictions of a certain academic middle-class Bengali-American world, with which I had been unfamiliar, are fascinating. She has a master's ability to create characters of both genders and all ages who act and speak the way such people really do.<br /><br />The analogy that another reviewer made to Michael Cunningham is, I think, apt. I will look forward to reading more of Lahiri's works.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This proved to be an excellent training partner.  I used it for long runs.  Worked well.  You have to remember to lock the bezel feature before you start the run.  Once in a while the setting changes and I have to reset it.  I had it only for a month.  Familiarity with the product and remember to lock in the settings will fix that problem.  It is a good buy.
B004132I20|5.0|I first watched this series on instant Netflix and immediately fell in love. It's a great, modern twist on an old classic.  Benedict Cumberbatch's performance is amazing and the chemistry between him and Martin Freeman is just pure magic. Entertaining, thought provoking, humorous, and beautiful on bluray it's a great buy for the whole family!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was a little wary of a book billed as an adult Harry Potter and other such stuff, but this book is so much more.  It's magical in it's setting but the motivations and characters are fully in the real world.  I wish this circus existed.
B002XLBC60|4.0|Good purchase, a lot of material on the dvd ! And the cd's are good as well The box could be better, it just has a few pictures...
B004XQO90O|4.0|This was an intriguing concept - Jake Gyllenhaal's character appears to be sent back in time - or to a simulated version of it, it isn't apparent at first - over and over to try and determine who planted a bomb on an already exploded train, in order to try and stop a threatened second attack. Each time he learns a little more, but we are not really sure where he is in 'real time' and where it is he is visiting (and I can't reveal too much without spoiling the film.) Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance, a fine balance of pathos, anger, fear, and frustration. The supporting cast of Michelle Monaghan (as a woman on the train) and Vera Farmiga (as a military officer involved in the simulation/time travel) are both excellent as well.<br /><br />The action was filmed wonderfully, and the story kept me intrigued. My only complaints, and the reason for the 4-star rating, is that the film dragged at parts, when the Jake G. character returned to the train over and over. It's a difficult scenario to pull off - forcing the viewer to watch the same scene over and over, or at least parts of it - and I felt it did get old. Also, I was still slightly baffled about certain aspects of the plot at the end - as to what the 'source code' exactly was - I felt it needed to be fleshed out a little bit more. But overall, a good film.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|I debated whether to rate this 4 or 5 stars, because while it's a great film, it's not particularly high-brow or Academy Award material. In the end though, I decided that within its Action genre, it's one of the best I've seen this year, so it deserved to be rated a 5-star. Liam Neeson puts in an excellent performance as a scientist attending a conference in Berlin who wakes up from a car accident thinking he is Dr. Martin Harris, but discovers that someone else also claims that identity. Neeson pulls off the desperate feeling of a man who feels he might be going crazy, but on another level is certain he is right. The unfolding of the story kept me guessing, and I wasn't sure for quite awhile which way the story would go. This has parrallels to Bourne Identity, but is not the same film.<br /><br />So overall, an excellent action film with a fine lead actor and  not-too-predictable plot.

B002JYPV3G|5.0|I've owned the \\"Slipknot\\" album a couple times since it was released in 1999. But this version, the \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" is the album that the maggots should cherish. The cd has all the songs on the original plus demos, remixes and b-sides. I wish they would have put the live tracks from the \\"Spit it Out\\" single along with it but it's still an amazing release. The DVD shows rare footage from the \\"Slipknot\\" years (1999-2000), the craziest footage that has been captured of the band you could ever witness. Also has music videos and the Dynamo 2000 live performance in it's entirety.   This is THE Slipknot album any fan should own. GET THIS!
1878424505|1.0|The author has simply re-written established theory and thought with his own inane terminology. He offers nothing new and because of his attempt to try to sound like he has new ideas by using fluff wording, he also misses the point and effectiveness of what books by earlier authors have provided. I resent that I spent money on this worthless drivel.
B003H9M1Q2|2.0|I have Dumbo \\"Big Top\\" edition which is wonderful. I got this edition because of the extra features. On the back it says there's a feature about the making of Dumbo and also a video about the ride at Disneyland. I was hopeing that the \\"making of\\" feature would have the existing video interviews with some of the original animators but no such luck. I've seen video of Disney animator Ward Kimball talking about Dumbo but was that footage included here? NO. It's the current animators talking about the making of the picture so it's all second hand information. They did include some footage of the original live action reference footage of the dance team for the crows which is the reason why I gave this review two stars. (They did include the audio portions of Ward Kimball's interview in the commentary as well as audio from other people. Why not include the original videos in the \\"making of\\" section?<br /><br />Then the bit about the ride at Disneyland has Imagineer Tony Baxter. He talks very briefly about the ride and they do show one concept painting from 1954-1955 which I've already seen elsewhere. I was hopeing for a bit of history like how the original was designed by Arrow Development and what led to the decision to install the current ride in 1983 and how the current ride at Disneyland had been intended for Disneyland Paris. But nope, nothing of the sort. Tony Baxter talks, like I said, very briefly, but then the segment dissolves into Disney advertisement dribble about how \\"magical\\" riding Dumbo is.<br /><br />Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. The actual film itself.<br />What I mean is, the video transfer. Did the restorer fall asleep at the video panel!?<br />On the previous DVD of \\"Dumbo\\" Big Top Edition the video transfer is beautiful.<br />Crisp beautiful colors. Not so on this version. The color on this version looks dark.<br />I would even say that the color looks dead. It doesn't \\"pop\\" off the screen at all.<br /><br />So forget this version of Dumbo. Get the 60th anniversary edition or the Big Top edition, both of which are available on Amazon.n or the Big Top edition, both of which are available on Amazon.
B005974CNA|2.0|It's better than their previous album, but the best thing I can say is that I didn't completely hate it.  I was far from wowed and the song structures are sloppy at best.  One or two songs are just obvious attempts at making radio-friendly songs and other songs are loaded with obligatory complex instrumental passages, like \\"Oh wait, we need to show off a little on this album!  Quick, let's wedge something in between the verses!\\"  The band has been around for over 25 years and few bands that last that long (and few bands do) can maintain the same creative spark they once had.  Dream Theater held onto that spark for a while, but as is evident with \\"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\\" and this album, that spark has fizzed out.
B003L77GH4|5.0|It arrived on time. Great quality. I love having this season on DVD finally. This season is jam-packed with twists and turns for every one so I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of deleted scenes, featurettes. Also, the bloopers are hilarious. I'd recommend this for any fan of the show or anyone trying to get caught up on the show.
0316017930|4.0|The book is interesting and wonderfully written. Keep in mind though, that the author is just that: a writer. He is not a scientist and his claims are not based on fact. Interesting as they may be to think about, there is certainly no statistically relevant information to back up the majority of the claims. That being said, it's a good read and gets you thinking, which is a plus.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|It's rare that I like 70% of a CD. I can say in all honestly that I love 95% of this CD.
1416585710|5.0|I loved Lisey's Story. My copy came from work, where a co-worker left it behind when she left the company. I sat on it for about a year before I actually made an effort to read it.<br /><br />To me Lisey's Story is a simple and beautiful love story. You slowly discover the depths of Lisey's love for her (deceased) husband, through all the side stories from their several years together. I liked the hint of darker things in the shadows, in the corners, just out of sight, without actually jumping into them right away.<br /><br />This is not your average King novel and some people looking for the shock `em frights of his other books will be disappointed. However, if you have a little patience and let the story take hold, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
0312323867|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Griffin's earlier book, Something Borrowed. It was hard to imagine that the second book, Something Blue, could live up to the first one. After all, the lead character was shown to be completely shallow, self-centered and a user in the first book where her fiance, Dex, takes off with Darcy's best friend, Rachel.<br /><br />Indeed this book starts out giving Darcy more in-depth treatment, complete with flashbacks to her childhood and long engagement to Dex. It was hard to identify with someone who relied on her looks to get all that she wanted. Not a very nice heroine, but one follows along with curiosity. Will Darcy eventually run out of friends to take advantage of? It seems that many back away once she makes some major mistakes in a fling with the less-than-charming best man from her defunct wedding. Pregnant and feeling abandoned, she reaches back to the first boyfriend she ever stole from best friend Rachel.<br /><br />Off she goes to London to mooch off him and indulge in some retail-therapy. Griffin does a masterly job of redeeming the character of Darcy and tying up all the loose ends. Well worth reading!
B0047E6LW6|4.0|THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW EVER, I TRY TO DO MY BEST.  IT'S WAS ODD TO BUY THE ALBUM FROM GHOST ON AMAZON, WHERE I  JUST THE BOUGHT THE NEW ANTHRAX TOO. TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC  A OLD BAND, WHOM WENT BACK TO THEM ROOTS, AND A NEW BAND  STARTING OUT. THE FIRST TIME I HEARD OF GHOST WAS FROM \\"THAT METAL SHOW\\" OF VH1 CLASSIC. THE GUYS THERE REALLY KNOW THERE MUSIC. THE MUSIC FROM GHOST BRING BACK THE MUSIC OF THE 80' LIKE BLUE OYSTER CLUT. IT WAS SO NICE TO HEAR A CLEAN ABLUM  ONCE AGAIN. GHOST HAS TAKING ALL THE GROUPS FROM THE PAST TO MAKE THEIR MUSIC. WITH A NEW IDEA, THEY DON'T HAVE TO SCREAM ALL THE TIMES OR PLAY AS FAST AS THEIR CAN TO GET THEIR POINT ACROSS.THEY SUBJECT MATTER COMES ACROSS AS EVIL, BUT WHEN THE SONG IS OVER, ITS COMES OUT GOOD. A LITTLE TWIST. NOT A LOT OF BANDS CAN PULL THAT OFF. TO END THIS REVIEW , IF YOU LIKE BLUE OYSTER CULT, SLAYER, WITH A LITTLE  RAMMSTEIN IN IT, YOU WILL LIKE THIS ONE. I CAN'T WAIT FOR ANOTHER ALBUM FROM GHOST?   P.S. I SORRY IF THE REVIEW COMES COMES OUT A LITTLE WEIRD , I AM A BLIND VETERAN, AND NOT EVERY THING LOOKS THE SAME TO ME. I HAVE TO MAKE THE WORDS BIGGER THERE NORMAL.....I'M  A 54 YEARS OLD HEAD BANGER..
006074748X|4.0|Mary Stewart is an accomplished romantic suspense author with a literary style far above most in that genre. Here she take the reader to Austria as Vanessa March seeks to discover what her husband is doing there when he told her he had business in Sweden. Think of the movie \\"True Lies.\\" Her search takes her to a traveling circus where a fire had killed two men. There she realizes that she's stumbled upon something bigger than just her domestic conflict.<br /><br />The scenes at the circus, in the Austrian village and in the castle hotel where she stays are deftly described by Stewart. There's some midnight cat-and-mouse activity on the roof of the castle and other scenes to raise the level of suspense. Despite these, this never achieves the page-turning, edge-of-the chair effect of Wildfire at Midnight or The Ivy Tree. It was a pleasant re-read for me, but doesn't stick in the mind the way her best books do.

B0000AUHQT|5.0|I don't know what people are talking about.  All I can think is they have not read the book, because everything about the movie reflects the story.  A younger Robert Redford is perfect as the rich, but somewhat pathetically wanting Jay Gatsby and Mia Farrow make a perfectly lovely, but foolish and silly Daisy Buchanan. And, Nick Carraway as portrayed by Sam Waterson was just right as the narrator/friend of Gatsby.  The sites of the books are portrayed by shifting location making you think they are exactly where they should be.  The gorgeous mansion in Newport R.I. made a perfect ballroom and even the smallest of references to things seen throughout the story just right in the movie.  Any variation work because they do not destroy the intent of the book.

When will Crocs get smart and make 1/2 sizes?? The espresso color is very dark brown just like in the photo. Sweet!
B005NS5CX4|4.0|Lady A comes out and does it again.  The last album produced the hit 'Need You Now' which was like the absolutely perfect Christmas or Birthday gift that just simply can never be outdone.  However, within the first 15 seconds of putting this cd in my car's player, I was texting a friend and saying \\"the new Lady A cd is going to be amazing and I haven't even gotten half way through the first song\\".  Since that text on the Wednesday after the cd came out, I haven't pulled the cd from my car or stopped it to listen to anything else.  There is rarely a cd that comes along that you can just listen to in its entirety without skipping any songs.  Lady Antebellum did that with their previous cd and they've done it again.    The first song, 'Own the Night', hasn't failed to not boost my mood, get me ready to dance, or just be a great song to listen to in the morning, afternoon, or evening.  It's upbeat and makes you smile.  It's followed by the hit single 'Just a Kiss' which is the song I immediately played for my fiance and told him that it reminded me of he & I a few weeks before we got together in our \\"just friend\\" stage.  The upbeat & country laced 'Friday Night' is just perfect for any warm night driving in the car with the windows down while the more downplayed 'Cold As Stone' and 'Wanted You More' may make you look back at your past and be great for a romantic slow dance.  Over all this cd may have songs that you don't want to listen to all the time but if you want a cd that you can pop in and don't have to fuss over finding songs for wherever you're going or for the perfect mood that you're in, this is it because you can put it on repeat and sing to the steering wheel.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The show is as strong as ever in the fourth season. The characters are very well developed, and funnier than ever. The writing is at its peak. The addition of cast members as well as clever plot twists help to keep the show fresh. Any collectors of the series will definitely want to add the fourth season.<br /><br />Jennifer K.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|I bought this headset mainly for gaming on my PS3 and was blown away with how much more I could hear.  I went with these because headsets like Astros are way more expensive and require other accessories.  With these, everything you need is neatly put together in one unit.  I only had one issue with this headset when the 'chat mute' button stopped working properly and muted both chat and game sound instead.  I contacted Turtle Beach about the issue and they got back to me promptly and replaced my headset free of charge.  No more problems with the new headset.  I'm very happy with the purchase.  Note that there are other models with better sound (7.1 surround and so on) but these are perfect for a casual gamer and someone looking to get a little more sound out of their system.  Works great on PC as well (perfect fore watching movies on a laptop) and is compatible with Xbox 360.

B0015DRPJU|5.0|My daughter read all 8 of this series after finishing the Twilight books.  She was not disappointed.  She switched back and forth from Kindle version to actual book because sometimes she didn't have time to get to a store to start a new one!  Any teen romance/vampire fan should seriously consider getting into A Vampire Academy.  My high school students read with pleasure during silent sustained reading when I have these available.
B002C6A6FY|5.0|In the various special features included in this package, you'll hear the assertion (over and over again) that one of the reasons for CASABLANCA's greatness is that the actors themselves (as well as director Michael Curtiz) were filming pretty much on the fly, with no idea what tomorrow's shoot would entail or how the darn thing was going to end.  Makes sense, I suppose.  If the actors were as tentative and uncertain about the outcome as the characters they portrayed, it could only add to the authenticity, right?  Well, of course, and I don't doubt the veracity of this story really, but when you think about it, COULD this story really have ended any other way?  Could Rick and Ilsa really have suddenly announce to Victor Laszlo that THEIR (Riok and Ilsa's) personal desires really did \\"amount to more than a hill of beans in this crazy world.\\"  Would they ever have been so selfish and crass as to add, \\"So you just board the plane, Vic old boy and vamoose on out to Lisbon.  After all, you've got your work, your cursed integrity and principles, and you sing a mean version of \\"The Marseillaise,\\" so take some satisfaction in your mission and leave us lovebirds alone.  We've always had Paris, and now we'll have Casablanca too.\\" In 1942? Not bloody likely.  That point aside,  film scholars and critics have every reason to hail CASABLANCA as one of the all-time greats.  It does what the best movies always have done: tells a great story with wit, sophistication, a sense of intrigue, an expression nobility--and doesn't stint on the romance.  It's got it all, and even better, it's totally unpretentious.  Whether or not Bogart and Bergman knew where the story was headed, it's almost certainly true that they did not know how good a movie they were making.  Maybe Curtiz did: he was framing all those gorgeous shots after all, but I believe Bergman's film critic daughter Pia Lindstrom when she says her mother was absolutely baffled by fans' comments for years afterward that they justloved her CASABLANCA.  Though Bergman was never anything less than professional, it's reported that throughout the shooting, the actress was obsessing about her next big part in the more \\"literary\\" (and therefore more prestigious) FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS.  She never anticipated that Ilsa in CASABLANCA would become her signature role.  And it's certainly one of Bogart's greatest too.  As the special feature on Bogie indicates, he was an actor thoroughly dedicated to his profession, and while his range may have been limited (or his casting options \\"typed\\") by this point in his career, audiences knew that he was much more than just a screen tough guy.  His Rick Blaine is indeed evert bit the romantic and the idealist that the cheerfully corrupt police captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) accuses him of being.  We scarcely need Renault to tell us that, however.  If ever there was a sensitive sould hiding under a mask of worldly cynicism it's got to be Rick--and if there was ever an actor capable of embodying those elements (and all the shades in between) it was Bogart.  It's also interesting how much commentary there is in the features about how much an ensemble player Bogart really was.  It's hard to think of a more individualistic screen presence than Humphrey Bogart: yet it's also true that his best roles are in films with brilliant supporting players.  Aside from the aforementioned Bergman and Rains (who is perfect as the prefect),  there are great (co-)star turns by Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre (must have felt like old home week after MALTESE FALCON), Conrad Veidt and the solid, stolid Paul Henreid as Victor Lazlo.  The qualified ending is happy enough...for wartime.  Everybody gets to feel good about themselves in the end, as even Renault finds he's capable of something like nobility after all.  About the only people who lose out in the end are bad guy Nazi Major Strasser (Veidt)--and oh yeah, those \\"USUAL SUSPECTS.\\"
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I just finished this great little series and once again, another great series gets killed way too early.  Some of the other negative reviews are just too nit picky.  This show had great character development, great suspense, a great premise, great plot, and great intrigue.  It grips you from the first 10 minutes and never lets go.  I don't like shows that end without some sort of conclusion but this was so much fun, I am glad I watched it.  It leaves a number of unanswered questions but it does answer enough that you can build an ending in your head.      In my opinion, here are two major reasons why it had lower than expected ratings and ABC decided to axe it.  - There wasn't the sex or titillation that plagues our TV shows.  Too Mr and Mrs Joe Public are drawn to gratuitous sex instead of an intelligent, thought provoking plot.   - It required you to follow the story.  Because it wasn't a mindless show, you couldn't just bounce in and out of being focused on the show and expect to follow the plot.   If you liked Lost, Jericho, 24, Heros and other \\"series\\" type shows, you will like this.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|This is an entertaining movie, but typical Woody Allen (a)morality.<br /><br />I'm far left of the far right, but what's missing in Juan and María Alena's relationship is a child, not a third bed partner.<br /><br />But what should we expect from that master of self-indulgence, who in life (and art) practices pedophilia and incest.  You can see why he walked out on his family. Raising kids?  I need to get back to my artistic vision!<br /><br />One weak spot in Allen's direction was his use of a narrator, which seemed a short cut around developing the plot and characters.<br /><br />Finally, I don't see why Scarlett Johansson made it so big.  Part of a woman's sensuality and character come through in her voice, and hers sounds like a disaffected teenager, husky and unappealing (see Rachael Ray).

0385534639|4.0|When I first heard about this book, I was excited about it. It had started out as a NaNoWriMo novel and was already in the early stages of pre-production with Summit Entertainment - before the novel even hit the shelves! There was talk of circus acts being at the opening of major stores where the author would be, let alone other areas. Everyone was excited about this book and I couldn't help but jump on board.<br /><br />What I found was a great story. Erin Morgenstern is a fabulous storyteller. The main downer for me though is that this book is written like the era it takes place in, like a late 20th century novel. The first half of the book is spent setting everything up, meeting the various characters (some of which you don't find out their import until the very end) and making the circus. The circus itself is something I wish was able to be visited. The various tents are all enchanting and enthralling. I think I could lose myself for days if I went to the Night Circus. :)<br /><br />Overall, reading this book was a bit of a chore for me. I did like it and I knew it was good, but I had to sit with it in small doses to get through it. It is definitely unlike anything I have read before. I can also understand where all the hype came from and I can see how all the hype is warranted. It is a fantastic book, just not one i would personally feel the need to read again. Please don't take my review to heart; please check this book out yourself. The magic is horrendous even as it is fantastic. The romance is beautiful even when it is not seen. The lives these characters are forced to live are literally magical even as they are appalling. And the ending is bittersweet. they got what they wanted even if it is not the ideal context in which they live now.

0307463745|1.0|I don't hate them, I thought they told truths. But is it useful? Just put some nice words and say the sky is crystal ...... thousands of adjectives ... then \\"blue\\". Disappointing book.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I always worry if the next alblum that follows such a smash hit (Need You Now) could ever measure up. Well Own The Night does. The music and the words are just awesome. Each song tells it's own story. I love them all, but my favorite is Just A Kiss. Lady Antebellum, thank you for another set of just beautiful songs!
B005CM9DX6|3.0|I've been a massive Opeth fan since MAYH , with Still Life being my favourite (indeed I feel one of the greatest albums ever made) followed closely by Blackwater Park. Opeth has always struck me as a talented band with a ton of creative energy and taste. The only Opeth albums I could never get into were Orchid and Morningrise, and Watershed took a long time to \\"click\\" with me.  This album however just doesn't live up to the \\"Opeth standard\\". That is not so say it is bad, The Devils Orchard, Folklore, The lines in my hand, Famine , and the intro and outro are pretty good, but I feel the dark, Haxprocess , Nepenthe , and Slither are the absolute epitome of.....\\"meh\\". The songs are all over the place at times, and overall the whole album feels disjointed. There are transitions and passages in some of these songs that just do not fit well at all, almost as if they are there just on a whim to pad the songs length. Opeths songs have always been lengthy, but it always worked, ALWAYS. So hearing songs (that are even shorter than most Opeth songs)that have alot of \\"filler\\" sounding transitions that just don't work well at all is depressing.  In some ways this almost reminds me of listening to a bands first album. It has good ideas and there is potential, but it just doesn't come together well enough to impress all that much. This makes sense seeing as how this style of music is somewhat virgin territory for Opeth.   The absence of growls is not an issue as I have always loved Mikaels clean voice(which has improved over the years quite a bit), however there are certain parts where Mike just sounds a little over the top with the way he phrases certain words and such while singing, like hes trying to be flouncy and dramatic sounding and it just comes off as disingenuous and a little pretentious. But overall his singing is still good. The guitar works, but is largely unmemorable with only 2 solos on the whole album that strike me as anything special. And the drumming is the sameas it was on Watershed - techinically very good, but sterile and boring sounding to an extent (I miss Lopez quite a bit, although Axe is the better drummer technically Lopez had better feel and groove). I really feel that Akesson and Axenrot really are bad fits for Opeth, their playing is very technical but lacks feeling and warmth that Lindgren and Lopez had.  Anyhow, overall it is a decent album but NOT up to snuff compared to their older stuff. I think part of it obviously has to do with trying out a new style, maybe they just need to practice more and get the feel for it better, maybe this just isn't Mikes field as much as he may want it to be. I also think this lineup isn't good for the band overall, but thats another debate for another time.  Anyhow solid 3 out of 5 from me after having listened to it multiple times intently. Heres hoping the future holds better albums (whether it be in this prog style or their old style).
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|This is the most beautiful La Boheme I ever experienced.  The magnificence the of the screen only added to what was already the classic that La Boheme has always been.

B003Y3ZTGA|1.0|I was looking forward to Teenage Dream because I enjoyed One Of The Boys. But once I listened to Teenage Dream, I realized that most of the album was composed of generic club songs.

B000PMG16U|4.0|The movies themselves look amazing!! Absolutely Stunning! My biggest complaint was that on my sony blu-ray player the load times were unbelievably long!!!! My firmware is up to date, so i don't know what's going on, but out of my entire blu ray collection these movies are the longest loading hands down. By longest loading, i mean it takes literally MINUTES before the the menu loaded up and i could start the movie. I honestly didn't think the movie was going to start.  Now, once all that loading is done, everything is zippy and chapter searching and what not is fast. I'm curious what others have experienced with the load times.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Story ending is way to contrived and, though the two sides of characters (Pete, the boy on the bike and the travelers on I-95) are way too predicable.  King should refund money to all who paid for the story and post it for free downloads.<br /><br />King was one of my favorite authors for years, but from here on out, I will have to seriously think twice before I waste any more money on his drivel.  I gave this two stars for the simple reason, that it held my interest sufficiently to finish it.  Anyone considering this download, be forewarned it ends at 80%, with the remaining 20% about King's Kennedy book.  So I guess I also paid for that advertisement.  King ought to refund twice the amount any of us paid for this download.

0345529057|5.0|I've got to admit, I was turned on to this series by the HBO TV Show(Game of Thrones). After seeing the  establishment of Ned Stark as the classic protagonist, and then watching in horror as GRRM mercilessly and  without warning proceeds to behead him evoked a sincere emotional response of \\"What the heck?\\" I was  hooked. I've now read all 5 books(A Dance With Dragons is not included in this set), I will certainly be  buying book 6 when it's released.  I feel compelled to say that if his writing in book 6 keeps his fans as captivated and entertained as his  previous 5 books have, GRRM may have a problem. The problem being that his fans may decide to kidnap him  and lock him in a house with his preferred method of writing, food, and whores and force him to keep  churning out more books. He will of course need to be cloned, at least until we can devise a way to transfer  his consciousness to a Machine so that any tragic accident that befalls him will not end this truly Epic saga.  I'll spare you any real spoilers(besides the one mentioned above) but I will recommend instead that if you don't  already have one, you get a Kindle and buy this in the digital format. The reason for this being 2 fold. First,  you will get paper cuts from continuously turning pages. And Second, when you're backpacking through Europe\China  and Book 6 is released you can get it immediately and proceed to disappear for the week or two it will take you to  plow through the 1,000 pages of glory GRRM drops on us. The Highlight of your travels will inevitably be \\"OMG, Book  X was awesome.\\"  I would highly recommend this to just about anyone, it's a great work of literature. My only complaint is that GRRM  has a nasty habit of getting you sucked into a situation and then forcing you to wait several hundred pages to see  how it plays out. You evil, magnificent genius!  Get it now, Winter is Coming.

I enjoy playing puzzle apps and this one comes highly recommended.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I've been a huge fan since the show premiered on Starz.  It's just erotic enough and though I knew that the Roman's were very sexual, I was still surprised at how blatent everything was.  The women baring their breasts at the arena, that sex was just a 'thing' and didn't really mean anything.    Amazing story writing and an amazing lead actor.  Andy Whitfield was a beautiful man, inside and out.

030788743X|5.0|This book is aimed squarely at those who grew up in the 80s --- hooray for us!  I enjoyed the book greatly on its own merits and because of my demographic.  I cannot see anyone over 45 getting the book (it would be like reading Gunther Grass with no knowledge of European history, and for those under 30 they may enjoy and understand the technology angle well enough but few of the references (if Skolnick doesn't have a nerdy resonance with you, don't bother).

B002MJV75O|4.0|I love dawsons creek and have watched the series countless times. My individual season boxsets over many years of use were missing their booklets and some of the dvds were scratched. I bought his item to replace my current boxsets and I am very pleased with the product. Many customers reviews mentions the dvd packaging, which I agree could be improved. I did not experience glue or scratches on the dvds but they are very snug in their sleeve and take a little more work to get out. But otherwise I like the layout of the boxset. Includes episode descriptions, pictures, and cast info. Takes up much less room on the shelf that 6 individual boxsets. I am happy to have the entire series all together.
034547581X|5.0|This engrossing account of the harrowing battles that took place in the Ia Drang Valley is a gripping eyewitness account told from numerous points of view.  Lt. Col. Harold Moore was in command of the operation and his co-author, reporter Joseph Galloway, was also present.  They interviewed the survivors and pieced together a compelling oral history that reveals the operation and the experience of the men who lived it from every angle--even, occasionally, from the enemy's point of view.  The result is an exhaustive and exhausting read that commands respect for soldiers who, whether they were drafted or had chosen a military career, struggled to do their best under horrendous conditions and often paid the ultimate price.  It is also an interesting look at strategy and tactics under constantly changing battlefield conditions.  Moore and Galloway take care to mention the name, hometown, and a telling detail about every man who fell, and the book concludes with a moving testament to their memory.
B004SBBDB2|5.0|I tested this cable with a Sony 53\\" XBR HDTV, an iPad 2, an iPhone 4, and an original iPhone. The cable plugs into the iPad/iPod/iPhone at one end and then into the component video (red/green/blue) inputs as well as the R/L audio inputs on either your TV or your AV processor. With 6.5' of cable, there's plenty of room to bring the cable around to the front of the unit where you can plug in your iPhone when desired.<br /><br />Play music on your iPod and it will be sent through to your stereo system without any significant audio loss. It actually sounds quite good. That, I expected. What I didn't expect from the iPhone 4 was the quality of video reproduction. Sure, I had shot a few videos with the phone over the past few months. I'd even watched some of them on my laptop monitor. But here, on my HDTV, I got to see just how nice the video quality is from the iPhone 4.<br /><br />Now, if you open a single photo, it doesn't go through to the video output, but if you play a slideshow, you will get each individual photo and video. You can pause to watch a certain photo for a long period of time. If you open a single video, it will always go through to the video and audio output.<br /><br />This particular cable is appropriately flexible and it has a USB port so that it can be used for recharging your iUnit if desired, or simply connecting it to your computer. Great cable!
0553386816|1.0|As an avid Grisham follower, I feel compelled to write this review to tell you not to invest in this book. I do not usually write reviews, so it must be bad for me to actually take the time to write this. This book is a collection of short stories.  After reading the first story, I was so disappointed that I almost put the book down, but thought the other stories might actually be more intriguing. I was wrong. They all fell short of Grisham's potential and were certainly not what I was used to in his earlier books.  I understand that not every painting can be a Rembrandt, but what were his publishers thinking?  Perhaps, Grisham should concentrate more on content and quality than annual deadlines.  He seems to be writing for quick money instead of from the heart.  I suggest that Grisham return to the legal genre that made him an initial success and built his career instead of resting on his laurels and pumping out sub-par books. Save your money!!

B003B02O3C|5.0|I've read a few Grisham novels and I have found them all to be entertaining (except Bleachers - Couldn't get on board with that one. In fact after Bleachers I stopped reading Grisham, thinking he had lost his touch).<br /><br />I saw \\"The Rainmaker\\" described as his best novel, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Bought it on Kindle. Glad I did, for I don't feel any great need to have it taking up space in my library.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me, though. I did enjoy the book and I had no trouble getting through it. I just say that to say that it was pretty typical of Grisham. Fun but not a collector's item.<br /><br />Some reviews are disparaging the book saying that the characters are rather one dimensional and therefore, unbelievable as real people. To them, I say: If you want believable, don't read fiction.<br /><br />I thought the characters were developed well enough so that the reader wanted the main characters to fair well and the bad guys to be punished and this is where the story fell short for me.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!<br /><br />Rudy wins the case, but doesn't get paid. I guess we're supposed to feel sorry for Drummond because he and his crew get spanked in court by a biased judge (whom I LOVED!!!) and lose the case but in the end don't get paid by the faceless corporate insurance monster. Decker, the misfit with the heart of gold barely escapes with his life. The good guy gets the girl and they go off into the sunset.<br /><br />In the end we are left to assume that Decker made the drop without incident and is living high on the hog after his great pay off. Rudy and Kelly go make a life for themselves in suburbia. Rudy become a history teacher and Kelly goes to school and completes a bachelor's degree but in the end becomes the doting wife and mom and lives the rest of her days blissfully happy, loved by a good man who would never dream of raising a hand to her. I guess Cliff's brothers and red-neck friends stop trying to find them and give up the idea of trying to kill her once they drive into the sunset. Drummond goes on to continue being a high-powered attorney and a power house in the court room. Booker, bless his heart, becomes partner in a few years and his wife `s social life is fulfilling and busy as she raises money for those in need and is of course the perfect lawyer's wife and they live happily ever after in a Victorian-style two-story house with 2 beautiful, college bound kids. Miss Birdie goes back home and lives the rest of her life alone I guess and never hears from her kids again. Buddy never gets out of bed and dies in his sleep one night and Mrs. Black (sorry, her name escapes me right now) smokes herself into emphysema. She eventually dies in agony but with the peace that she made those sumbitches pay!<br /><br />An easy story to read and certainly entertaining enough but the end fell off for me a little bit because we were left to make a LOT of assumptions about how everyone faired and I guess like to have everything neatly wrapped up at the end of a story. No loose ends. But that's OK. I'll still give it full marks because it did hit all my pleasure centers. For a soap-opera-type novel, it wasn't at all vulgar so I didn't have to compromise myself in anyway and what it was lacking in closure, I am more than capable to wrapping up in my own imagination.<br /><br />This is book is not going to change your life or expand your vocabulary and you won't be better for having read it but if you're doing any International flying for if you're laid up recovering from surgery, this is a fine book to keep you reasonably entertained.rummond goes on to continue being a high-powered attorney and a power house in the court room.

She eventually dies in agony but with the peace that she made those sumbitches pay!  An easy story to read and certainly entertaining enough but the end fell off for me a little bit because we were left to make a LOT of assumptions about how everyone faired and I guess like to have everything neatly wrapped up at the end of a story. No loose ends. But that's OK. I'll still give it full marks because it did hit all my pleasure centers. For a soap-opera-type novel, it wasn't at all vulgar so I didn't have to compromise myself in anyway and what it was lacking in closure, I am more than capable to wrapping up in my own imagination.  This is book is not going to change your life or expand your vocabulary and you won't be better for having read it but if you're doing any International flying for if you're laid up recovering from surgery, this is a fine book to keep you reasonably entertained.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I watched the unmolested '77 version of Star Wars for the first time last night.  Born in '79, I have never seen Star Wars without \\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\" ('81) stamped across the opening crawl.  It is really sad that, in 2011, I have to go to a poorly-ported bonus disc to watch one of the most influential movies of all time.  This is probably the best option I will ever have to watch the movie as it was originally made.  Unfortunately, the discs have some issues:<br /><br />1.) It is 480 lines letterboxed, which means the image is very small.  You have to hit the Zoom/Stretch option to get it to fill the width of your 16:9 television.  Being non-anamorphic, it is the same quality as a LD, but significantly less quality than the original 35mm it was shot on.  This is a really bad port of the film.  Writing the data anamorphically would have made it a lot better.  There is no technological reason for it to be letterboxed.<br /><br />2.) The audio has been stripped.  Star Wars was originally recorded on six track audio, but this disc only contains Dolby stereo.  Again, there is no technological reason for this decision.  The DVD would hold a 480 anamorphic image and 6.0 audio easily.<br /><br />Here is where the line between \\"restoration\\" and \\"totally messing up my childhood memories\\" is drawn: 3.) the bonus disc has no restoration attempt in either picture or sound at all.  Even without adding CGI anything, modifying dialog, adding deleted content, etc., there are still a lot of modern things than could be done to this film to crisp it up.  A lot of black special effects show up as shades of gray, so you'll want to set your TV accordingly.<br /><br />As for the other disc in the box, the Special Edition 2006 Version?  I threw it away.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I used to watch the original Star Trek TV series and movies growing up and thought I'd never like any new remake. I was wrong. This new version is so entertaining. I thought the cinematography and special effects were awesome, and Chris Pine as Kirk and Karl Urban as Bones were perfection, not to mention laugh out loud hilarious at times. The whole cast was superb. I've watched this at least 6 times and every time I watch it I enjoy it as much as the first time.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Movie was still in original packing, price was super. Very good buy will look for more DVD's especially the older ones.
B005KGPBM6|5.0|I heard an interview with Kevin Smith about this movie. He said he wanted to try to make a movie like other directors that he really admired made. The kind of movie where you finish watching it, and you're like \\"Wow\\". Quentin Tarantino, Sam Peckinpah and the Cohen Brothers were his inspiration for this movie. Did he succeed? In spades. If you've ever wondered just how good Kevin Smith can be, as a real film maker, and not just a supremely talented comedy writer/director, I don't see how he could have done any better.  If you like Quentin Tarantino, you're going to like this movie.  This movie is violent, and some of the scenes that really aren't that graphic are still deeply disturbing, and then you find yourself laughing at really inappropriate moments. I can't remember the last time that a movie has delighted me this much.   Usually, when I watch a movie, I can think of something somewhere that I would have changed. When I finished this, I could not think of a single thing that could have been done any better. This is up there with \\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Fargo\\".  Don't come to this movie like some of these others expecting silly over the top comedy, it's just not that kind of movie. Don't expect to get a lecture on the evils of...well the evils of anything really. It just isn't that kind of movie. This is a movie for people that love great movies. If you love the movies and directors I've mentioned here, then you're going to love this movie. It really is that good.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I routinely buy Sony sound product for their crispness, these are no exception.  They stay on while running into the wind and sound great.
B004I1K2NW|5.0|Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was excellent.  There was just a little very fine grain in some of the scenes - hardly noticable.  Overall, fantastic video presentation.  Aspect ratio is 2.35:1, and the movie lasts just over 1 hour and 45 minutes.<br /><br />The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was also excellent.  Plenty of surround sound, and a real workout for the sub-woofers.<br /><br />One thing - if you pause the movie, don't be gone long.  I paused it for a few minutes, and the screen saver came on.  I pressed \\"Pause\\", \\"Play\\", \\"Forward\\", \\"Backward\\", and could not get the movie to restart.  I had to stop the movie and restart it.
0316056863|5.0|My wife laughed every other page while reading this book.  I never read the book, but based on the hubbie points I got for it I must recommend.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Ever since i was a child i have been a fan of captain america moreso than batman, my grandfather was the biggest captain america fan and thats where i inherited his fandom from, had he been alive to see this movie with me we both would have loved every minute of it, the villains are very much like darth vader and his stormtroopers, the fight scenes and the stunts recall the action serials of days past,Youll find an action scene toward the end that will bring back memories of the convoy truck chase scene from raiders of the lost arc, and it doesnt end  there, for the comic fan there are so many references to these movies as well as other marvel movies as well. in particular the hulk, thor and the iron man movies. so sit back relax and enjoy!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Own the Night shows that Lady Antebellum is here to stay. Even though it is their third album, their message and sound remains the same.  The lyrics in each of the songs on this album will spark a memory with everyone.  I just love the overall message of this album, \\"Own The Night\\".  It's about those moments when you live it up and take chances.  Every song on here is amazing, it's hard to pick one that stands out.  Definetly purchasing this album would not be a waste.  I have listened to it non-stop since the day it came out, and it's still in my car and on my Ipod. With each time I listen to this album it makes me fall in love with Lady Antebellum more and more...
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Movie to see Angela is very good in this moive as the others are watch are good as well.She is a Mom in action.
B005F3XV62|4.0|The zookeeper is a good movie , not to be taken too seriously. If you just want to escape a hard day and laugh this is the movie for you. My Kids liked it too.(ages 13-6).It's entertaining not thought provoking. Overall it makes you feel good and you get a couple of laughs out of it. My kids especially liked the talking animal.
0446618306|5.0|When I first read the description of the book I wasn't so sure if I wanted to buy it and since we all know the effect Mr. Sparks, which would be when you read one of his book or are watching one of his book movie adaption have a box of Kleenex right beside you because you are going to cry. Anyway, I ended up buying it.<br /><br />Weeks after, one Saturday afternoon when I wasn't doing nothing much I took the book from my bookshelf and after a few pages I couldn't stop and I didn't stop until I finished the book, and course you can imagine the end result? I cried!<br /><br />The story is told in first person and through John's narration you see how he turns to be a rebellious young man into a very brave, kind and very good man. Not only does he put himself in the line of duty for his country but at the end of the story he makes the ultimate sacrifice and for that he's more than a hero.<br /><br />The plot may be simple but is well written and it not only concentrates in Savannah and John story but also the relationship of John and his stranded father. The book touches a very serious subject which is men & women risking their lives behind the enemy lines and the permanent effects it can have in their lives.<br /><br />I wish I could tell you more about the book but I can't spoil it for you, if you already saw the movies (I haven't) from what I heard is not 100% accurate but it does have the essence of the book which for me is important but by all means go to the original material you won't be disappointed. This book is a must READ for you, so far it has been the best book I've read from Mr. Spark so I can guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B00540G3G6|5.0|This was a great movie to begin with and the 3D conversion really makes it shine. There were quite a few scenes that just seemed like they were meant to be in 3D all along. Don't expect object to come flying out of the screen at you. This is a 2D to 3D post-conversion after all, but the 3D effect excels at creating depth which draws you in and immerses you into Tim Burton's crazy world. The puppets looked like you could literally reach into the screen and touch them. I highly recommend checking this film out. This is the perfect update to a classic film.
030746363X|4.0|the four body book was very long,detailed oriented and very controversial. it was very educational with the various ways to embellish yourself on differnt types of strategies to not only lose weight but to maintain the lost weight and enlightening on how to keep it off longterm.the exercises demonstarted in the book are very strenous and challenging. i will be using this book for years to come.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Super excelent!At time i expect and the quality of all want.  Just buy and see the efficience!The best buy a made.
B0017CW5J4|4.0|BMG members are quite the entertainers. A good buy for some unique entertainment if you are looking for a quick break from the usual.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was on the fence about this book after reading prior reviews, but I absolutely loved it.  I would not compare it to Harry Potter, but it was absolute poetry in its own beautiful way.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|the quick games will eventually free and lock you out on levels. they need to fix this.  I've betten the games three times now and had to reinstall it four times because it locks me out of quick play levels.  come up.with a update pronto. its been over two months now.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I originally posted this review with the caption \\"make a stand!\\" and asked people to consider not buying this set until the long-time fans get what they want - remastered, unaltered, Blu-ray versions of the classic trilogy.  The general response was agreement or criticism of not being adaptable to the changes (the latter is obviously from a younger crowd).  However, like a sucker I still bought this set, albeit at the lowest price I could get it and I used a gift certificate.  I originally wrote: \\"While this box set contains the complete Star Wars Blu-ray series, I can't settle for less when it comes to how George Lucas has butchered the classic trilogy. Especially since he only directed the first movie! Until this very eccentric, stubborn, yet creative man gives in and gives us what we want - a cleaned up, unaltered original trilogy on Blu-ray, than I have to make a stand.\\"  The part that intrigued me the most was to see the deleted scenes from the classic trilogy, which I have seen a few (low res), and heard or seen pictures of others.  Seeing them was cool, however, even one of the deleted scenes is altered now too (see Luke lighting his new lightsaber at the beginning of ROTJ - never happened, just built it and didn't turn it on...and Vader was NOT calling out to Luke - those are outtake images and voiceovers from ESB).   I further wrote \\"It's amazing that the man responsible for such an iconic cinematic creation is also responsible for its fall from grace. George Lucas - thank you for Star Wars, but give the fans what they want - the original trilogy (now in the Blu-ray format) just how we remembered it. Include the real deleted scenes, and make a better cover art...the current cover is terrible. The prequels over time have proven to be terrible and not true to what we learned in the classic trilogy, but \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" was strong overall. I will not buy these movies AGAIN and AGAIN, and I ask all of those that feel the same to make a stand until we get what we want and deserve - the original trilogy that we grew up with, visually cleaned up, with outstanding Blu-Ray picture and sound. Thank you.\\"  There are the aggravating changes that are inserted into the classic trilogy, specifically the Greedo/Han confrontation, this absurd wall that now covers R2 from the Sand People, the goofy drive-through at Mos Eisley, stepping on Jabba's tail, etc from Star Wars.  I thought I heard the lightsaber effects would be cleaned up, but Luke's training scene with the seeker is as bad as its always been.  The movie still works great despite the few cringe-worthy additions.  With Empire, it's the bad matching of the new Wampa while Luke struggles to get to his lightsaber; the sound does not mesh with the picture - see Luke running away from the Wampa with his lightsaber still lit, but you can hear it being turned off.  Having seen the original movies so often I notice all the changes even to the audio - changing Boba Fett's voice was reprehensible; the guy's voice from the prequels sounds cheesy.  During the escape from Bespin, the change from the white walls to windows does not match well, but the biggest offense of all was this unnecessary trek of Vader back to the Executor.  We all understand when he originally said \\"bring my shuttle\\" that he was leaving.  I do like the new shot of him walking across the platform to the shuttle, but the ensuing flight to his ship and arrival at his Star Destroyer chops up the flow of Luke's rescue from the underbelly of Cloud City.  It is absolutely absurd that they went further to show Vader arriving in the docking back which is directly from ROTJ and then a different angle of him coming down the ramp.  Inane.  On top of all this, why is George Lucas making these changes to a movie he did not direct??  With the exception of these absurdities, the movie still retains what makes it the best of the series.  I'm not going there with ROTJ, the movie was bad in so many areas as it is and it got worsewith the revisions, but the movie still has its good moments.  Overall, besides the terrible cover art, the box set is creatively put together, although it's difficult to get the disks out.  It's good to see all the extras, and the classic movies look much better in this format - it's kind of like seeing at the movie theater where you can see all of the facial expressions and details better.  The prequels look good in HD, a lot of it is CG stuff anyway so it should.  I'll skip over the first two prequels which over time I went from thinking they're ok to terrible, but the Darth Maul duel scenes are awesome.  \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" looks real good and just suffers on its own in areas with bad dialogue and unnecessary cheesiness.    So I was a sucker and bought the (classic) movies again (the sixth time I think).  For the price I paid it was ok, but I would still like to see the classic trilogy remastered and in Blu-ray.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was dreding the day I finished this series.  Excellent...Did you know that this series of books is one of the top ten banned books for 2010.  Shameful that we live in a world where others attempt to silence others because of difference of opinion.  This was such a well written, thought provoking story.  I am a 55 year old grandmother; and would recommend to all of you on the fence in our age group.  Dont let the fact that it is recommended reading for young adults; you will like it too!
B005IGDW24|1.0|I wanted to like this as I am a child of the 80's and was excited to see that The Smurfs where being introduced to a new audience. I usually don't write any bad reviews, but I must tell the world how I feel about this movie. The worst. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Right on par with \\"Battlefield Earth\\" or \\"Catwoman\\". Yes it is that bad. Don't believe me? Go ahead and get it - don't say I didn't warn you!
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Too many characters to keep track of after waiting entirely too long for the 5th book. The book beat to death unrelated characters and bogged down in its mirco plots.  The book was chopped to pieces. Maybe Martin will be able to bring it all together, but I doubt I'll live long enough to see that happen, what with his world book signing tours and missed deadlines. Will I buy his next book? NOPE! I'm done with Martin. I paid my money for the book and I was feel I was cheated.
B004LWZW4M|3.0|But not much originality. Having the human race wiped out by a virus of their own making to which Apes are immune .. Ok, it's been done, but I'll buy it again. To have the same virus make apes super intelligent .. hmm stretching things a bit far.   What is more likely to happen is that the human race will be wiped out and the Apes will gradually evolve to become the dominant race. That seems more likely the scenario that ties in with other POTA movies. Having intelligent apes inherit human technology and the intelligence to go with it doesn't fit the future stories.   Oh well, seeing apes evolve over a million years or so was probably to complicated for your average film maker these days.  Anyway, as a standalone movie about apes being treated badly and getting their revenge - it's actually ok. The first hour or more is about human and ape interactions, and is done pretty well. The last 20 minutes or so is all out action to satisfy those people that found the 1st hour boring. Unfortunately, it is the last 20 minutes that is boring as the graphic-action scenes become all-too predictable.   The movie also includes the all-too familiar 'bad-guy', (yep, the same one you've seen 100 times before), played by the guy you all want to die, who has crap lines to read, but that's ok because they match his acting and will satisfy your want in the last minutes of the film (why do the baddies always die in the penultimate scene)!   Could have been an intelligent film, until the mindless action graphics took over.
B000V5ZIBU|5.0|if you can get through the first couple of season DS9 is by far the best Star Trek has to offer.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I am probably the only person in the world who doesnt think that the special editions aleterations really arent THAT big of a deal. i do not understand how Obi Wan Kenobi making a different noise as he scares away a few sand people could RUIN Star Wars for anyone. People think since they have had the movies since kids that they have some type of ownership over them, which obviously don't have. now i will say that i am not the biggest fan of all of the alterations, but cmon, the differences will probably total up to maybe 3 minutes of a 2 and a half hour movie being changed? If you had no previous introduction to Star Wars, and saw the movies as they were on the blue rays would you hate them? if you honestly can answer that question with a yes, you can not call yourself a Star Wars fan.  5 stars because the movies look and sound awesome on Blue Ray and the total differences throught all the movies adds up to like... 3 minutes of alterations.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|I couldn't wait for this album to come out and was definitely  not dissapointed!!  I haven't stopped listening.  Lady A continues to write and record soulful, heartfelt and fun music. There is something for everyone.  Friday Night is a Get Up & Party song that I can't wait to hear live.  Just a Kiss and Dancin Away With My Heart remind you of that first love.  I can't pick a favorite!

B004SRWW0C|5.0|This app is great for rooted users. It offeres an easy and intuitive way to access the full Android system. It really is hard to explain all the things that make this a great file explorer, but try it out and you will probably agree. I'm sure it is helpful to non rooted users as well, but I've never used an unrooted phone so can't speak for it.
0340881542|5.0|Second in the Cherub series, James is back in action along with his friends from Cherub. This time there is a cocaine drugs ring to infiltrate and take down, and Cherub are brought in to get close to the children of the drug baron, Keith Moore.   These books are good action adventures, in the same vein as Alex Rider. The concept is perfect - how many children have not dreamed at some point of being a secret agent? Look at the success of Alex Rider or the TV programme M.I.High to see how this series will immediately stir the imaginations of its intended audience.   The books are gritty. Not realistic exactly, but not stretching the bounds of disbelief too much, but also describing the world much as it is. That makes these books best suited to a young adult audience although I have known children as young as 9 to have read these. They no doubt enjoyed them, but parents of those 9 year olds may prefer to discuss some of the themes in the book. This story was not an epic struggle between good and evil. Instead the good guys have their faults and the bad guys have firendships, loyalty and love. This is a good challenging read for young people.
B002VRZEYM|1.0|This tripe is just someone pushing an agenda, and trying to act like it is a balanced view.  Typical Hollywood style garbage.
0810983915|5.0|Having loaned out all the previous books in this series to various members of my daughter's class (and the class above), this book arrived this week. I sneakily read it quickly before my daughter got hold of it - which was a good thing too because she raced through it in about 24 hours and took it to school today to lend out!   Once again Greg writes a wonderful journal of his life. Understated text set off by hilarious cartoons that had me laughing out loud as I read it. Few books get me actually laughing out loud, but that has been an experience for every one of this series (if you find this book first, the series begins with the red cover \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\". Its useful to start at the beginning as some of the jokes refer back to events in previous books).   Greg is on summer break in this book, and the story of that break makes a wonderful self contained book that has a funny and very appropriate ending.   I highly recommend this book - and as its an easy read its a good series for less confident readers, but don't keep it from the confident readers too! Its too good not to share. Parents of my daughters friends (especially the ones who are boys) tell me they are having the funny bits read out to them over and over again! So this is perfect for ages about 8 and upwards (no upper age limits in my opinion!)
B0018CVQFM|4.0|You forget until you hear them all at once how many good songs Graham wrote and performed as a member of the Hollies, CSN (and CSN&Y), with David, or on his own. The back stories on the songs in the detailed booklet are enlightening but the name-dropping may put you off a bit.   But if i knew those people as well as him i might be happy to say so, too...
0689878451|5.0|And Tango Makes Three, written by Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell, is based on a true story of two penguins living in the Central Park Zoo, who fall in love and form a family. The reason this book appears at the top of the 2010 Most Challenged Books list is that the penguins are both boys.<br /><br />The authors start the story by describing Central Park and the zoo that is located there. They talk about the people visiting the zoo ~ all types of families. Then they explain that the animals in the zoo are families too. When they arrive at the penguin house, Richardson and Parnell tell readers that each year, the girl penguins and the boy penguins start noticing each other and become couples. But one pair of penguins was different. Silo and Roy were both boys, but they did everything together. They even built a nest together.<br /><br />Their keeper watches the penguins as they mimic the other penguin couples and try to hatch a rock. He decides to give Roy and Silo an egg that needs to be cared for instead. The penguins spend much time sitting on the egg and keeping it warm until the day it cracks open, and little Tango comes out. The zookeeper calls her Tango because \\"It takes two to make a Tango.\\"<br /><br />This story was very sweet and full of love. I read it to both of my kids and they enjoyed it as well. M loved the part where the egg cracks open, and C thought it was cool that the book is based on a true story. Neither made a single comment about the fact that Tango has two daddies.<br /><br />I would highly recommend And Tango Makes Three to families with two dads, two moms or those with adopted children, as I think children in those types of families would be able to relate well to the character of Tango. I also recommend it to anyone who wants to show their children that families come in all different forms ~ as well as to anyone who likes penguins, of course!
B005N0PJJO|5.0|This story had me glued to my Kindle - couldn't put it down. I can't really review this book without considering both books in the series. I have to admit, I was wary at first due to Christian's, um, preferences, but am so glad I didn't let that keep me from reading it, because I haven't had a story grab me like this one did in a while. The course of Christian & Ana's relationship was very consuming, tense & deep. The gradual acceptance by both of them as they attempted to meet each other on some sort of middle ground really conveyed the depth of their feelings for each other. Another reason this is so good, are the issues they had to overcome and/or deal with - haven't come across some of those in any other book! I will be reading the next book as soon as it comes out!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I have been excited for Own The Night to come out since the day Lady A talked about the new studio album. I pre-ordered it the day it was made available. Just a Kiss was a great choice to have as the first single and We Owned the Night is almost an anthem - I think that is a great title to have as the CDs title.   My favorite songs on the CD are #8 Wanted You More and #9 As You Turn Away. Wanted You More is one of those songs that during the chorus to crank it up and belt along. It has a great melody. As You Turn Away, Hillary pegs how alot of women feel when the breakup is happening.  There is not one song on the CD that I don't like. I think this will be another HUGE success for this trio. The next album, I would love to hear Dave sing lead vocals on one of the songs.  This album is HIGHLY recoomended.
0385341008|5.0|This read has everything.  The author understands pacing, character development and has a wonderful feeling for place and time. You will appreciate this writing and probably pass it on.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|I had borrowed this set from a friend of mine a few years ago so I was familiar with it to start with. With the price having come down a bit I decided to get a copy for myself. Anyone who is a fan of George would be happy with this addition to their collection of his music. Reading a bit, I don't think there's anything planned for the near future that would get you all this content with any better quality and packaging. The box is beautiful, the remastered CD's are great and the extras (though there could be more) are a plus. The DVD is enjoyable and brings back memories of MTV when they actually showed music videos. All in all a fine collection. George deserves another go round of someone pouring over what must be hours and hours of stuff in the Archives but for now this set suits me fine. My Beatle collection goes back to the Newspaper from Sunday Morning stating \\"The Beatles on Ed Sullivan Tonight!\\" so I'm no \\"Run of the Mill\\" Beatle fan. (Pun Intended).<br />I have most all their stuff together and solo on Vinyl and CD including the Mobile Fidelity Masters Box Set on Vinyl, The Blue Box LP Set, The 45's Set, the 2009 Re-Masters, The New Lennon Signature Box and the recent McCartney Remasters on CD and Vinyl along with All Things Must Pass 30th Anniversary on CD and Vinyl and 40th Anniversary on Vinyl and Hi-Res Downloadable files. Oh yeah, and about 11 different releases of \\"The White Album\\". Seems that joke from the movie \\"Men In Black\\" is not far from the truth as far as the White Album goes. Enjoy the \\"Dark Horse Years\\" Hari Fans!
0446556750|2.0|This is only the 3rd Michael Connelly book I've read. The first, Echo Park, I found moderately interesting if a little short on surprises.  The second, The Lincoln Lawyer, was much more enjoyable, but that may have been because I found the central character more interesting.  This one feels a little stretched. Combining both of the central characters from the previous books, it seems to struggle (a lot) to find the right narrative tone.  Some of the chapters are in the first person, from Mickey Haller's point of view, and others are in the third person, even when Haller is the major character in them.  At no time, though, do we get a good feel for Harry Bosch's point of view, not even when he's the major protagonist.    Overall, the book feels like a bit of a rushed job.  The plot also has a few similarities with Echo Park, particularly toward the climax, so if you've read that book you might find this one a little bit tedious. I got through it, but I never felt in any way surprised, or particularly engaged.  If you're a big Connelly fan you'll probably enjoy it anyway.  If you're not, and you haven't read any of his other books, start with an earlier book before getting to this one. Or just skip this one entirely.
B004KPLVYA|5.0|Excellent movie!  It speaks well of determination and support from at least his mother in the beginning and his father's pride in the end.  I love movies like this.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It was my first purchase of a CD by Adele.  She is terrific, powerful and she sings like she really means it.  It is beautiful.
0553381695|5.0|After having read the first few books in the series over ten years ago in the late nineties I felt like I was forgetting huge portions of the plot as I read through book 4 and the recent entry in the series in A Dance with Dragons.  I am even more amazed with the second read through of A Clash of Kings than I was with the first read through.  Where Martin excels is his ability to transport the reader to another time and become absorbed with his detail.  He is one of the few authors who isn't afraid to create a great character, only to kill them off (book 1 spoiler: insert Eddard Stark).  Or to create truly awful characters that really make your blood boil just reading about them (insert Cersei and Joffrey).  This is why this series is so great and A Clash of Kings is just as good if not better than A Game of Thrones.  While you don't read too much about Joffrey and Robb except in passing, you certainly see plenty of action amidst the kings.  We have several clashes of kings throughout the book that are momentous and huge, that make you eagerly read on to find out what happens.  Tyrion takes on a much more prominent role not only in the series but at King's Landing, while Jon is front and center as the watch delves deeper beyond the wall in pursuit of the wildlings.  Theon takes a front and center role in this one as he tries to prove to his dad and family that he is ironborn and pisses sea salt like they do.  In the end you are left with the first 700 pages as captivating and interesting, and then the final 300 pages absolutely riveting (a trend of Martin's; everything escalates so that the last 300 or so pages have you glued to the book).  I found in the second read through that Martin was hinting at a lot to happen in future books.  Take Daenerys meeting with the Undying and the prophecies they gave to her.  Many have happened throughout the book and in other books in the series, some even happened in book 5.  My first read through I wouldn't have known, but my second read through made them glaringly obvious.  A stellar fantasy and a great addition to the series.  5 stars.
B002QF31HQ|5.0|Pat Moraz's only studio album with YES was one of the band's finest from the late seventies.  Impeccable performances by Howe, Squire, Moraz, White and Anderson...make this an easy listen.
B005OIAFQC|1.0|At this point in what I suppose you could call their 'career', you have to wonder whether the members of VNV Nation are actually engaging in an elaborate Andy Kaufmanesque prank designed to see how many times they can release the same album before people cotton on and lose interest completely.  While the notion that a band can spend an entire career mining variations on a particular sound or theme is perfectly legitimate, when a band continues to rehash exactly the same bland sound and trite, horribly self-involved lyrics (almost verbatim) for period of nine years or so, one begins to wonder whether the title of this album itself isn't in fact a knowing joke by the band concerning both the lack of effort put into its conception and production - although the band would have us believe that they endured something of a rosy crucifixion during the production of this album; it would seem that what didn't kill them made them blander - and the increasing mindlessness, gullibility and lacking critical faculty of certain elements of their audience (although I suppose calling it \\"Formulaic\\", \\"Generic\\" or \\"Automatic For The Sheeple\\" would've been gilding the Lily somewhat - then again, they could well be the titles of the next couple of albums for all I know). Given the lumpen nature of the tracks offered up here, one has to seriously question how much further patience the more critically discerning elements of its audience has.  To break the album down into its component parts:  \\"On-Air\\" is the obligatory mood-setting instrumental which, despite mixing analogue radio static, choral synths, and the 'Atomic clock pips' motif from 'Future Perfect', still descends into tedium long before the deeply pedestrian mournful Piano refrain has kicked in (which is no mean feat for a track that lasts just over three minutes).  \\"Space And Time\\" is your prototypical jaunty post \\"Matter And Form\\" era album opener and recycles so many of the lyrical motifs that have been overused on the last few albums (\\"let the current carry me\\", \\"on open seas\\", \\"lost in thought\\") that the band should surely be line for some sort of Queen's award for recycling by now. It's really only notable for the spectacularly fluffed opening line - \\"Teeeeear Aaaapaaart\\" (which, rather amusingly, sounds as if the vocalist has been surprised on the toilet by a sound engineer wielding a microphone and demanding that he sing while at stool) - and the fact that the band inadvertently name-checks Channel 4's 'Grand Designs' (\\"Bunty and Tarquin have really made the most of Frank Lloyd Wright's theories concerning the use of space and light in their environmentally friendly new build in Cheshire...\\")  \\"Resolution\\" is techno by way of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' on a football terrace. You've heard the band mine this particular seam both musically and lyrically many, many times and, let's face it, it was tedious the first time. Trite sentiment is the order of the day: \\"Raise your head up high and blow your brains out,\\" to paraphrase 'The Bloodhound Gang'.    \\"Control\\" is the obligatory cookie-cutter snarly \\"blood and anger\\" track that has popped up with pedestrian regularity on all of the last few releases (see \\"Entropy\\", \\"Testament\\" et al). Musically and lyrically it fails to convince as a statement of indignation, ambition or intent and the word-association-football lyrics are also inadvertently hysterical (because if photographs are to be believed, certain members of the band have already acquired all the body that one can comfortably enjoy).    \\"Goodbye 20th Century\\" is a slim finger-paring of nothing which is about the best thing you can say about it. A blandly grandiose synth limps lazily over the distorted narration from an upbeat fifties propaganda piece/news reel concerning the potential wonders of 'the world of tomorrow'. Get the irony, kids? It seems like every industrial and nu-metal band in the last twenty years has recorded this track; even those masters of the mediocre, 'LinkinPark', have mined this particular seam of banality recently.  \\"Streamline\\" is essentially Giorgo Moroder's synth-line from 'I Feel Love' combined with some rather obvious and painfully-rhymed couplets concerning how nice it would be to be live in an art-deco future. A fair enough sentiment, but seeing as this band devoted an entire album to this very topic about ten years ago, one does feel that they're repeating themselves somewhat.   \\"Gratitude\\" pulls of the difficult trick of being morose, petulant, self-involved and egocentric at the same time. Musically it's indifferent and lyrically it's little more than a slightly more verbose take on the song 'Thank You' by RnB songstress 'Jamelia'. Listening to it is sort of like being cornered in the pub by a drunkenly emphatic and rather surly divorcee who insists that he's over his marriage (and is so much stronger for it) but who then proceeds to spend the next two hours talking about his ex-wife.   \\"Nova\\" sends us back to football terraces. Yes, it may be anthemic and probably the best track from a bad bunch, but it's still utterly generic.  \\"Photon\\" is a bargain basement William Orbit knock-off (circa his 'Adagio' album) and sounds like something that would be played over the goal highlights at the end of an edition of British Sports program, 'Grandstand'. I'll be honest I skipped through this one because I was losing the will to live by the mid-way point some three minutes in.  \\"Radio\\" is the staple protracted album-closer and in isolation is really indicative of much of what is wrong with the album as a whole: like many of the songs, it is far too long; like many of the songs, its lyrics are trite in their espousal of cookie-cutter pop-psychology platitudes and, like virtually all of the songs, it is just not musically interesting enough to hold one's attention for its duration.   To summarize, I suspect that at this point in their career the audience for VNV Nation is, in a certain regard, now analogous to that ofthe audience for Michael Bay movies: on the one hand, there are those who are young and naïve enough to think that a tired collection of gee-whiz sounds or pretty CGI - devoid of any real interest, content or motivation beyond securing a profit margin and maintaining a foot-hold in the market-place - really is the greatest thing since Sliced Bread; and on the other, there are those who gain a perverse sense of enjoyment from going along to see what kind of bland, derivative cr*p is going to be wheeled out this time and how much further the material can descend. I, for my own part, have only ever seen three Michael Bay movies: I paid to see one, the rest I slept through when they were shown on Television; this attitude also neatly encapsulates my feelings towards VNV Nation. Thanks to a combination of friend's copies, Youtube and Last.FM, I haven't had to part with money in order to perform (or rather endure) my cursory one listen-though to each of the albums that they've released since 'Future Perfect', but then there is a certain poetic justice in that, because as more people than I care to mention have observed recently, they haven't actually released a new album since 'Future Perfect'.  Final Report Card For \\"Automatic\\":  Ten out of Ten for commitment to the concept of recycling.  One out of Ten for short-changing the audience yet again.
B004WJRF6C|4.0|Worth it all just to hear Every Night and Maybe I'm Amazed.  The artwork is by Linda McCartney, and the music is all Paul....organic, before organic was cool.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|I recorded the first season of \\"Gods of the Arena\\" when it aired on Starz various channels.  Be prepared to throw out all your visual inhibitions and memories of old Roman movies.  As I viewed the parade of nudity, sex and stop-action violence, I thought to myself, \\"This is probably the way the Romans lived. We just hadn't adjusted our 20th century vision to imagine the all-out, nose to the wall, lives they lived.\\"  After the while the blunt language got funny, since every other word was \\"f**k\\" or \\"c**k.  My first impression was a sell-out to attract viewers.  But as I watched the episodes I began to see there was really a STORY here.  When I saw that Sam Raimi was involved, it was no surprise.  He never let anything get in the way of his movies, no matter how ridiculous or gory.
B004SC8XHI|4.0|I love Booker T's music. I especially wanted this album because I am from Memphis, too and I like the Beatles. The album incorporated both things at once, with the Abby Road/McLemore Avenue parody and the cover of the songs. I did not like his versions.  I would be much happier with original Booker T music.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I just finished reading dwd and I enjoyed it. This series is my first fantasy book and I enjoyed it.  I would say that the beginning was a bit slow but the story picked up in the middle and just kept going.  I do respect the amount of time that martin took to write the book. Very few writers can manage balancing a book with so many characters.  His attention to detail makes this world believable.  I anxiously await the next book.

0345444051|5.0|This is an easy read. It is fascinating to read the futuristic iteams written about in 1953 as pure fiction, which are now inextricably woven into our daily lives. As we move toward what some call stargates or the dates of earth's evoluntion in current conversation this book reads like a prophetic message to be heeded or at least taken under serious consideration.It gives one pause at the very least. If one likes science and science fiction this is a quick but deep look into a great minds vision of our future.I have read several paperback editions to tatters. I give and loan it to those I feel will enjoy it. No. 1 on my do not miss list of Sci Fi that just might not be.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|I loved this movie. I first got it through Netflix after a friend told me how good it was, and she was right. The story is a little confusing for the first time viewer but it was literally and metaphorically magical. The acting is pretty good and the story is not very predictable.  Now for the quality. I think the Blu-ray version is fine based on the fact that I have not seen it in any other form. The Blu-ray includes featurettes with Gaiman. The blooper reel in the special features was worth watching. Hilarious! There are also deleted scenes.  Good movie and a very good deal
1609611543|1.0|Who doesn't know that refined wheat and sugars cause problems? From this book, I learned a tad bit about how today's wheat has been altered. That information could have been conveyed in a magazine feature or an NPR interview. Once Dr. Davis made his point, I expected the book to guide me in making this change.<br />I was wrong. You'll be seduced by his rehash of other's work and then just when you need some nutritional guidance, some meal pleans ... you'll get more theory.<br />I have serious issues with this book.<br />1.

On his Facebook page he's been promising recipes \\"from his test kitchen\\" for three weeks. Not one recipe.<br /><br />2. His recipes have no nutritional analysis. But this is all about nutrition, no? In the rush to print, nutritional analysis costs money and takes time. Failure to include it in radical nutritional lifestyle change is a cheap out. A cop out. It's sloppy and casts a shadow on credibility. If he wants readers to adopt his theory, they need a plan.  I wish Amazon would note in the product description whether or not nutritional analyses are included in a book with recipes.<br /><br />3.And on his Facebook page he cheers on fawning admirers while dismissing anyone with serious questions and/or issues.<br /><br />Based on his Track Your Plaque business model, my feeling is Dr. Davis is building a \\"fan base\\" to sell us something else for which this book is the set up. 12 lbs. of Grass Fed Ground Beef for $129.95? $220 Blood testing kits? In the future, maybe Gluten-free foods? A cookbook for sure.

1439170916|4.0|He misses the real advances. With combinatorial chemistry it is now possible to make billions of compounds which can be tested immediately against pathology slides.  This plus the genomic sequences corresponding to these binding sites will allow specific treatments per patient per cancer per course of disease.  He should check who really thought up monoclonal antibodies and also who humanized same and who made the first combinatorial library.  It is nice that he mentions Sol Spiegelman, though somewhat negatively. He forgets to mention that it was Sol  and Hall who invented the \\"hybridization\\" methodology which was the process the clinicians cum scientists used to identify \\"oncogenes\\".  He also mistakes correlations at the molecular level with causality. Almost all the \\"oncogenes\\" and \\"suppressors\\" can fit into a simple paradigm of genes being involved in cell division, both normal and \\"abnormal\\".  He also misses the karyotyping of cancer cell lines, missed by many at NCI.  He also missed the Zinder report commissioned by the National Academy on the results of NCI's \\"War on Cancer\\".  But I did read it in one sitting.  So,I recommend it. I wait for a newer edition when the dramatic advances of combinatorial chemistry allowing personalized treatment show that the Emperor is naked.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I would buy this in a heart beat if it was only on DVD. I won't replace my entire DVD collection just because the movie companies are so stupid to stop selling things in a good format that so many have purchased.  When they release this complete Star Wars collection on DVD I will be the first to buy it.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|We watched this movie with our children and grandchildren last Christmas on TV as a holiday special and everyone loved it. We failed to record it and it was not available in the USA. I saw a recommendation for it in the August Family Fun magazine,now available in a USA compatible DVD. I ordered one for myself,one for my grandchildren,and one for my niece's children. My niece said her girls, ages 2 & 4, watched it 3 times in a row the day they received it. Wonderful family movie, very clever and imaginative.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There's not much one can say about this app.  It is very nicely done!  1) has many reading plans to choose from  2) easy switch between books, chapters, and translations  3) has many translations in almost any language. I use Russian Synodal Version, Holman Christian Standard Bible, New American Standard Bible, New King James Version, and New International Version.  I am still to learn [Koine] Greek in the future. So, I will add that too...  All in all, why in the world you would not have this app?
0439023513|4.0|I loved the series. A complete page turner. I read all three books without a blink. Everything about them is brilliant and intelligent. The only thing I did not like about the series is the ending. I felt uneasy when I finished it.
B0042KZJ5K|5.0|The film was brilliant: the \\"Down from the Mountain\\" concert was superb: the original CD of the film music a delight: where does one go from there?  The producers have achieved a real service to their audience by adding a second CD of memorable tracks, some really good sleeve notes on the performers and it is no hardship whatsoever to have the first disc twice over.  This is great purchase for anyone who loves good old mountain music: I cannot recommend it too strongly.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|As I am sure the 100s of other reviewers have already said, there is an absence of the lead singers trademark death metal growl.From my personal experience, this album grows on you. At first I didnt like it but I listened to it two or three more times, and now its a favorite. This recording may require several listens to enjoy the artistic beauty of it. This isnt the album for everyone, but I as a long time Opeth fan,still like it, and even if they kept going down this road with the absence of their metal voice, I would still enjoy it. If you have heard Watershed, and enjoyed the tracks that are without screaming, its close, and you will probably enjoy this. The music is actually quite good, and I enjoy listening to this album. Don't get me wrong, I miss the death metal growl, but I am not going to refuse to buy any more of their music just because they did another record without any metal vocals.  The point of being a fan of an artist is to support them when they decide to change or experiment with. Give it a listen first, and make sure you like the sound of the tracks.This album also grows on you too, so just keep an open mind and give it a few listens. Its still very good despite the lack of metal growls. I am hoping that in time, Opeth will go back to its older style of mixing metal growls with beautiful singing, but if they dont, I am still on board. My only REAL complaint about this album was how hard it was to download the extra bonus tracks, it took me a full day because I didnt have the right player. You have to hope that the DVD is recognized on your computer to download the songs, or your screwed. So, despite that, great album. If you enjoyed damnation, and Opeths songs that lacked the death metal vocals, you will enjoy this album. Hope this helps, I feel like each time I listen to this, it gets a little better.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really liked this trilogy and it kept me interested throughout the series. I thought the first book was the best, and by the third, the storyline did tend to drag out a bit, but the story was completely interwoven and could have been just one long book. I am a 32 year old mom, and was a little nervous that the series would be too young for me, but it wasn't. It was really captivating and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B005CM9DX6|1.0|i should have read some reviews before i bought this album! it really is nothing like what i expected. i had no idea what to expect from this album but thought that since it was opeth it would be something grand and complicated. sadly it is quite the opposite.. most of the songs have very little to them. long periods of barely audible background noise punctuated by random guitars and vocals..  to be honest.. 90% of this album wouldn't be out of place used as elevator music.   definitely not the kind of music i am into or was expecting from such a talented band..   if you like restaurant music tho, this is the album for you :)
B0042JIL1U|3.0|Yes, one disk would be preferable.  For me there are three stages of Abbado:  precancer, cancer treatment, new glory.  During his cancer treatments, well, he was understandably not at his best.  And he is a great conductor.  At his best, he brought warmth to the Berlin Phil. from the cold seclusion of the Karajan years.  The anti-Karajan in personality, Abbado hates the limelight, is warm and personable with his players.  They love him.  And it shows.  Abbado and the BPO: great German discipline and the Italian ability to have a good time.  It worked well.  Until he became so ill that he had to step down.  In 2011 Abbado is picking the musicians he wants from across Europe and he gets pretty much whomever he wants.  Carmignola is one of the best baroque violinists on the planet so I had high hopes.  And Carmignola is great.  It's just the that the orchestra, seems underpowered and lacking the erruptions of joy that is Bach.  I notice the recording is from 2007.  I wonder, if this was a time he was still climbing out of cancer?    I'm not thrilled about the live applause - on repeated listenings I always think of it as wasted moments of my life and rather, like a laugh track, a sign for me to join in.  Silly on a record.    The recording is good.  Often very good.  But so are others.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|The movie is half decent at best.. Green lantern was probably not the best choice or a super hero seeing how some people (maybe most) Don't know to much about him... Its not like hes really interesting enough to actually care. Another thing is that most people who do know of the green lantern watched shows like static shock or the justice league unlimited and saw the other green lantern which is basically what i grew up seeing.. As far as the movie go it is ok.. I don't know why Hollywood feels the need to put unnecessary situations in a movie.. That's one of the main reasons that transformers is so bad. Its supposed to be for children but no something i would ever let  a child watch (regarding transformers). That's one reason why so many of these movies actually flop cause u cant take your child to the movies to actually see it. Even superhero movies now a days have to be screened... smh...
B0033H7VI6|5.0|For the price, this is a helluva knife!  It's beefy, the handle is comfortable and provides numerous hold positions, it sharpens easily and seems to hold a good edge.  The choil in front of the handle allows me to choke up on the blade for delicate, close work, while gripping it by the swell at the pommel between the thumb and the index and middle fingers allows leverage for chopping.  The concave reverse curve near the choil also facilitates close cutting, while the convex belly curve towards the tip replicates the curve you'll see on the business edge of a hand ax for deep penetration when chopping or splitting. The balance-point is located between the blade choil and the first finger-groove on the handle, so when I choke-up on the blade it feels blade-light and handle-heavy, while with my forefinger in the first finger-groove it feels blade-heavy; this also contributes to the feel when alternately doing close-up work or more substantial cutting.  The sheath is also well-made and versatile, with the detachable velcro-fastened pouch handy for extras like a fire-steel, small sharpener, etc.  The only problem is that the knife alone weighs a pound, and with the sheath and a few items stored in the pouch it tops a pound and a half; and the sheath is 14 1/2 inches long.  I figure that, since I'm not the die-hard survivalist/militia-type, I'm not going to be packing around that kind of weight and bulk while hiking in the woods.  So, unless I'm deliberately out there testing my survival skills with this specific knife, it's not likely to be with me when I inadvertently wind-up needing it the most...  I'd be much more likely to have a smaller 3 1/2\\" puukko blade and a 10\\" folding Japanese pruning saw with me (my current preferred set-up), which can do about the same work as--or more--efficiently and at a third the weight (8 1/2 ounces).  But, boy, it sure can feed those self-sufficient survivalist fantasies I'm prone to at times...  PS:  This is NOT a collector's displayknife; it's a working tool.  In no way does it compare to the fit, finish and aesthetic appeal of handmade or collector's knives (like my Randall-Made Model 7--a high-end handmade working knife).  It's an inexpensive knife that happens to be made of good quality materials (like 1095 high-carbon steel) by a mass-production process to an affordable price point.  It is not offered or represented to be anything other than what it is, which at the current price is quite a deal.  For instance, the grind on my knife wasn't even or flawless, there was a small pockmark near the choil where they tested the Rockwell hardness, and the handle scales don't line-up perfectly, etc.  If you want near-flawless, be prepared to pay big bucks for it: like $350+ and a waiting list of 5 years for a Randall-Made direct from the maker, or twice that from a knife dealer for instant gratification.

B00004YW6I|5.0|In 1991 PJ Harvey MBE had released her first album,'Dry' to strongly favorable reviews. Ten years on from her debut, PJ Harvey released what turned out to be her biggest selling and crtically acclaimed 5th album, Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea  It was nominated for a Grammy. It also won her the Mercury Music prize in 2001, the first woman to achieve that. 'Stories' was listed in Time Magazine's 100 greatest albums, where PJ found herself amongst such diverse luminaries as the Beatles, Stones, Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell, Miles Davis, Frank Sinatra, etc.  For me, 'Stories', lives up to its reputation but is a very different album to her raw debut. This time PJ Harvey got as close as ever to making a polished mainstream album, despite having already been known as a more 'alternative' or experimental artiste..<br /><br />On the whole the songs are upbeat, melodic and unlike most of her other albums it's not such a challenging listen on first hearing. There's also a few typical, slower, dark PJ songs on here too, tracks like 'Horses In My Dreams','Beautiful Feeling' and the soulful 'We Float'. The melodic 'You Said Something' is another firm favorite. If there is one track I'm not that keen on, it is her most commercial sounding rocker she ever wrote, This Is Love, which is disappointingly clich&eacute;d in style compared to PJ's other songs. but despite that it's still listenable. There really isn't one genuine filler song to be found on here. 'Stories' hasn't dated at all, and like all great albums probably will continue to stand the test of time.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with PJ Harvey, then Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea is a really good place to start.

B004LWZVZC|5.0|There are numerous reviews out in cyberspace, convicting this film of ignoring the horrors of slavery, or promoting the martyr-ization of Mary Surratt. Well, when I watched The Conspirator, what I saw was the denigration of the constitutional rights of American citizens, in order to satisfy the vengeful motives of the bureaucracy. Was Mary Surratt guilty of conspiring to kill President Lincoln? Maybe. Even probably.  But trying her, and the other four conspirators, for murder, in a military court, was a gross and indecent miscarriage of justice. The murderer, John Wilkes Booth, was dead, and the authorities were out for blood, not merely for revenge but also to drive home the fact that the South had lost the Civil War. And that is the point of this movie, plain and simple.<br /><br />With respect to the cinematic qualities of The Conspirator, the acting was competent, the sets and backgrounds evocative of those dark days, and the courtroom scenes compelling. The views of Washington D.C., when it was still largely rural, are fascinating, as were the scenes involving the Lincoln's funeral train. This is a serious film about a topic that is just as relevant today as it was in 1865, and with question of capital punishment added to the mix, it is just as important today as ever. Thoughtful, intelligent, and probing.

0802473156|5.0|This book taught me a lot about myself as well as my ex-husband. Had I read this first, instead of try to detroying what we had for over 13 years; we would have been celebrating our 20th anniversity next year. But I have to say God is a awesome God! We are in the process of the reconstruction of our relationship and this book has help me in my thinking and actions. I highly recommend this books for anyone on the verge of giving up. We are not made to be quitters so give this book a try and see if it doesn't change your life. If nothing else it can't hurt!
B00505470O|4.0|Washed Out is the one-man project of Ernest Greene. If you are not familiar with the sound of the band, think Neon Indian or even Phantogram. After releasing a couple of EPs on vinyl and cassette in '09 and '10, now comes the much anticipated debut album of Washed Out.<br /><br />\\"Within and Without\\" (9 tracks; 41 min.) starts off with the long instrumental intro of \\"Eyes Be Closed\\" before eventually Greene joins in on vocals. The sound of dreamy synthesizer-based songs continues from there on, and the tracks flow by very smoothly one after another. As such it is hard to point out \\"highlights\\" as the album creates a certain mood that continues on for 40 min. without much interruption or change. And this is by no means a criticism as such, as I've been enjoying this album for months now, it was a big part of the \\"sound of the summer of 2011\\" for me.<br /><br />I had the good fortune of catching Washed Out in concert just recently at the outstanding MidPoint Music Festival here in Cincinnati. What is a one-man band in the studio, is in concert now a 5 piece, including a live drummer (copying Neon Indian and Phantogram?) and bass player, but also 3 keyboard players (including Green's wife, to whom the album is dedicated). They put on a fantastic, albeit too brief, set, playing mostly songs from \\"Within and Without\\". Be sure to check these guys out live if you have a chance, and \\"Within and Without\\" the studio album ain't too shabby either.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I'm not one to do workout videos - I find them monotonous and vaguely embarrassing.  While this video is no exception (terrible music, annoying rhetoric like, \\"Think about jeans shopping!\\"), it does seem to actually provide a good workout.  I run and practice yoga regularly, and am in fairly good shape.  It's difficult to get thorough workouts in with three little kids however, and on the recommendation of an acquaintance, I decided to give this a try.  I don't find any of the exercises to be overly challenging, but I definitely work up a sweat.  Within a couple of weeks I've seen increased tone and definition, even though Level 3 is easy enough that I frequently follow it with Level 2.  These seem to be effective, targeted exercises that, as a supplement to a regular routine (for me, hill running pushing a double jogging stroller) can put on the final \\"polish.\\"  That said, I do wish there were more abdominal exercises.  I'm not overweight, but after baby #3 I could use some more toning in that area.  I find the abdominal exercises to be pretty easy, and not as effective as the upper body stuff she does.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Ridley Scott is a generous film maker, he shares every cut of his movies including the ones he doesn't like so much  I absolutely adored the original movies and would seriously take the Pepsi challenge with any Star Wars fan out there in terms of doing a C3PO style verbal recount of Star Wars like he did with the Ewoks. I watched Star Wars twenty or more times before I lost count in less than a month as a child. I drove my siblings mad, and to this day I can verbalize every droid beep and Jawa noise. Shown any portion of the movie I can word every line and mimic every piece of music if given enough to drink  Currently I find the films difficult to watch, including the original cuts and this is largely because Lucas has beat these classics into the ground and then some, quite literally out of existence. That is very sad  After a certain period of time surely every piece of artistic work becomes public property. Isn't this copyright law? When is this going to happen with Star Wars? Apparently the answer is 95 years after publication. So we'll have to wait until 2072 unless Lucas lets go. Only the Empire could be so mean  Seriously, why does Lucas not simply look right here on Amazon or Google. Just a few days after release over 2000 people are protesting with negative reviews for these blu-ray discs. Try to find one other case as extreme as this here on Amazon  Please do what you did with THX 1138 - give people all versions remastered even if you prefer your latest iterations, and give them the freedom to decide which one they would like to watch. This is film history, don't lock it away
B0051MKNV8|4.0|Good quality movie, compeling characters, strong story only a few minor plot holes, otherwise a pretty good show.  Unique story and fun to watch.
B000001EGA|5.0|I remember getting this album originally in cassette form, when first released in the mid-'70's.  I've also gotten his \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums, and noticed that few songs from Captain Fantastic (if any) have been considered \\"greatest hits\\" (with the exception of Philadelphia Freedom). However, \\"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\\" is one of the best albums E.J. has ever released.  In fact, the only song on the album I don't really care for is his rendition of \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.\\"<br /><br />I've recently been digitizing all of my vinyl records, and realized that, between those and the CDs I have, I was missing a heap of my faves.  So I bought the CD, and spent an entire day just listening to it.  In some ways, the album could stand as a \\"Greatest Hits\\" release on its own merits.  Simply put, it's Taupin/John at their best.
B003ODL004|1.0|Hans Zimmer is a true Renaissance Man--by which I mean he hires various talented people for his studio to cobble together soundtracks to which he affixes his name. \\"Inception\\" is a fine soundtrack, but in this case one of his \\"little helpers\\" seems to have helped him to a bit too much copyrighted material: have a listen to Dario Marianelli's soundtrack for \\"V for Vendetta\\" and in particular the theme best realized on track 8, \\"Evey Reborn.\\" Now give \\"Inception\\" track 8 (\\"there are no coincidences...\\") titled \\"One Simple Idea\\" a listen. Casa de Zimmer didn't even bother to change the key signature from the original....  I have no problem with \\"Inception\\" as a soundtrack--just wish Hans Zimmer would ocassionally give credit where credit is due.
B0052WSX32|5.0|I must say I wasnt sure what to expect from this CD (and Amazon UK seems to have shipped it via slowboat as it took forever to get here) but it was worth the wait! I fell in love with it from the first listen. OK, so the recordings arent new (let's face it Doris is either 87 or 89 years old) but most of these recordings have never been released on CD and the few that have are worth another listen. Most are from her 80s cable tv series (that I never saw, so those songs are new to me) Doris was in her early 60s around then, but her voice sounds as good as ever. The songs might not be up to the standards of her prime, but they are quite enjoyable and Doris leaves her impeccable imprint on them all. I think the high point for me is My Buddy because it segues into Doris' intro to her son, Terry, singing Happy Endings and she calls him her buddy. Now whenever I hear that cut it brings tears to my eyes. It's too bad Doris couldnt be coaxed to adding her track to his, but I'm sure emotionally it would have been too much for her. Thank you, Doris, for remembering your fans. If you are one, this is a must buy! Here's hoping Sony follows through with its promise to release its Best of Set of picks chosen by Doris. (I probably own them all, but will buy it anyway) Doris' singing harks back to happier times. Listening to her beautiful voice will always put a smile on your face. I know it does mine!
B004LWZW2E|1.0|Starts off OK and then slips into bizzaro world. This movie has \\"should a, would a, could a\\" written all over it. Cheeseball demon is included with some ghosts that are not scary once they are revealed. The director shows too much and leaves nothing to the imagination. Disappointed with 75% of the film and it is so disappointing I can't recommend the decent beginning at all.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Lady A does it again, with \\"Own the Night\\". I have been a huge fan since day 1, and can say this album follows suite with the other 2 in just being awesome. Lady A is so amazing and think Own The Night displays their true talent. Lady A continues to deliver such great music and I love how great they are to their fans. They are untouchable right now!! I think they will be around for quite a long time!! :)   LadyAFan!!

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Own the Night is incredible. All the songs are brilliantly written and sung with the group's amazing vocals. The songs are easy to relate to and fun to sing along with. My favorite songs are \\"Own the Night\\" and \\"Dancing away with my Heart.\\" Both songs tell a story that anyone can picture themselves as part of. They both make you think about past moments in your life. Of course, those are just two of the many great songs on this album. If you are a Lady A fan, or even if you're not, you should give this album a try. You may find it to be one of your favorites, just as I did.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Not worth it until we get the original versions... :P  I am so disappointed with George Lucas... he seems to loath the people who love Star Wars... why else would he refuse to give us the originals?

I am not sure if this situation is normal according to some thing like error scope. Does anybody know about it? Very thankful!

0307341577|5.0|Oh my God. OhmyGodOhmyGodOhmyGod. Wait, I already said that when I finished Flynn's first novel Sharp Objects.   Well, I'm saying it again. Flynn has written another mesmerizing novel. Maybe \\"written\\" is too tame. She has created a world, brought characters to life and crafted a story with an intricate scenario.   The narrative switches from main character Libby Day's voice in the present to third person pov from Patti (the mother of the Day family) and Ben (who was convicted) leading up to the murder of the Day family twenty four years ago. The events finally crash into each other exposing truth, secrets and lies in a stunning revelation. The plot is filled with details that circle around to serve the story and keep it moving forward. While reading Dark Places, I didn't realize at the time that a certain plot point or detail was a clue that would fit in later. At the end, it felt like I had traversed a maze and picked up pieces of a puzzle along the way.  Libby Day is an honest, damaged character (physically and mentally) who never received the best tools for coping with the tragedy she endured. She is not someone you might trust or be particularly drawn to in real life, as self pity and guilt aren't the most positive qualities and make an unflattering combination. However, her character flaws stem from her vulnerability and she quickly endeared me to her with her honesty and tenaciousness. She hatches a plan in order to make income that quickly becomes a search for the truth. I really have to say all the characters are believable and jump off the page. They are your neighbors, the woman in the grocery store, people you see on the news. Even the most outrageous characters are so real and I think part of it is because their inappropriate and even crazy behavior is seen through others. There is no attempt to get into their head, there is just observations. Everyone is simply fascinating.  The writing is strong, significant, powerful, dark and engrossing. Flynn fits the scenes to the story's mood and makes the world a dreary, depressing landscape yet at the same time the words themselves and how they fit together are lovely and rhythmical. The words flow making an easy read out of a dark, disturbing story.  Dark Places took hold of me and held me until I finished it. I don't think it's a story I will ever forget. I urge you to read this. It is something very special.

B003J27WFW|5.0|Tremendous career retrospective from a band like no other.  Very, very well done, as with Dunn's other work.  I am a huge Rush fan, and like any, this gave some unique perspectives deeper into the band, tied up some loose ends--and left a few more mysteries in our grasp.  Bravo!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|If not for all the hype I would not have stayed with this book to the end due to the slow pace and constant shifting back and forth between time periods and places. In addition, books written in the present tense just don't seem \\"normal.\\" I thought overall it was \\"so-so.\\" Certainly not another TWILIGHT.
B000021Y7X|4.0|I saw this on VHS at a friends house about 20 years ago and remember enjoying it, but not overly impressed at the time.  I was never a huge TH fan, but always respected their songwriting and musicianship.  Last week, I saw this DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $4.95 and picked up a copy.  WOW!  To hear (and see) this again on modern digital home theater equipment is a real treat.  I selected the \\"Studio 5.1\\" audio in the setup menu and was blown away by the quality of the recording & mix.  Great performances across the board by the band as well.  Even if you are not a fan of TH, you are very likely to be after experiencing this one.  Not to be missed!
B005OIAFQC|5.0|I find it amazing, that someone would go to all the trouble, and time expressing their overall hatred of not just a CD, but of the band itself.  Last time I checked, this was supposed to be a review of the actual cd, and not venting on the band, and including their personal disdain, in their rating.  So, playing along with the precedent you have set, I give 5 stars, for the band, for their live performances, for their love and generosity towards their fans, oh, and for another great CD.  I mean I haven't heard the entire CD, but from what I have heard, I like it. But it doesn't really matter, since we are grading the band as a whole, right?  :)

B004GYY714|5.0|I was thrilled to stumble on this app with so many to choose from out there.  Great selection of stations, but users need to understand that many of the stations aren't broadcasting 24hr/7days/week.  For example, I was able to listen to the Green Bay Packers game on tunein today, but that station is only available as a live broadcast unless you buy the pro version which I understand to be buggy and/or limited with regard to recording and playback options.  However, there are many live radio stations, both local and from around the world that are available all the time.  I'm so impressed with the free version that I couldn't ask for more.  I do recommend it highly.
B00007LTIL|5.0|I would buy this album just for the song ripple thats such a beautiful piece of music. The whole album is great there are great artifacts about the album inside the cd.

0451196716|5.0|Of all of the Stephen King novels that I have read, I have to confess that I found The Long Walk to be the most psychologically horrifying. While it is true that the majority of King's body of work has deeply psychological elements (whether exploring multiple personalities or the horror of dealing with poverty in dystopian realities), this book hit home like a punch in the gut. Anyone who has ever suffered will be able to relate to this book in some way or another.<br /><br />The story has been told numerous times in other reviews here, and of course there are hints given on the back of the book. 100 boys are chosen from a pool of volunteers for The Walk, a contest in which only one boy can possibly win. The walk continues until there is only one Walker left.<br /><br />Throughout the story, King follows the perspective of Ray Garraty who, along with his small band of friends, struggles with his own emotions, his hopes, and his feelings of teenaged angst. We learn just enough about Garraty to keep us reading. We know that his father is dead, that he has a girlfriend who he is desperate to see during the Walk and that his mother is afraid of what will happen to him.<br /><br />The story of The Long Walk is the story of psychological, rather than physical, suffering. The first time I read this book I considered it dystopian, but I am now not sure that this genre placement is accurate. Instead of the story being sociological (wherein we see the depravity that often comes from poverty), we are dealing with the thought process that leads up to a boy submitting himself for The Walk.<br /><br />Each boy must endure a series of tests in order to qualify for the walk, and still only very few are chosen. Of those chosen, each has the choice to drop out before the deadline, and yet there are 100 boys at the starting line every year, risking everything for the walk.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much (not that too much hasn't been said in other reviews) because the book does hold some secrets. Anyone who suggests that the ending is predictable or that the entire story can be given in a review without giving it away is a fool. Read the book for yourself, and ask yourself: Would you submit yourself for The Long Walk?e ending is predictable or that the entire story can be given in a review without giving it away is a fool. Read the book for yourself, and ask yourself: Would you submit yourself for The Long Walk?

B004EPZ00W|4.0|Brad Pitt (one of the producers, as well as lead actor) and company do a more than adequate job of bringing the story in the book \\"Moneyball\\" to the silver screen.  But aspects of the story, namely the technical analysis of baseball players and the game of baseball that constitute \\"Sabermetrics\\", do not necessarily translate well to the action-oriented visual medium of cinema.  \\"Moneyball\\" the movie is at its best when it shows the impact these somewhat arcane numbers have on people and the action on the field.  But in the final judgment, \\"Moneyball\\" doesn't quite measure up to the all-time great popular baseball movies of the past couple of decades, a group that includes \\"Bull Durham\\", \\"Field of Dreams\\", and \\"The Natural\\".  Disclaimer:  I read the book \\"Moneyball\\", and as is the case about 90% of the time for me when I read the book before seeing the movie, I enjoyed the book more than the movie.  Other people I saw the film with had a higher opinion of the movie than I did.  \\"Sabermetrics\\" relies upon statistical analysis of past player performance and game situations to determine the best players to put on the team's roster and the field, and what actions they should do in a game.  The first quarter of the movie, which is when the filmmakers have to explain roughly what \\"Sabermetrics\\" is and how it works, is slow-paced and mostly consists of conversations, with computer-generated pages of numbers rolling across the screen providing the only action at times.  But what makes \\"Moneyball\\" compelling is when it focuses on the impact the Sabermetrics philosophy has on the many characters in the film: the players, the team's management and ownership, people outside the game, and ultimately the game of baseball itself.  The film does build to a climatic moment on the field, and does a wonderful job portraying the drama involved in one of the key games played that season.  You don't have to be a serious baseball fan to enjoy \\"Moneyball\\".  A casual acquaintance with the game is all that is required, since at its core \\"Moneyball\\" is about human beings and relationships and how they are changed when a new way of thinking comes along.  \\"Moneyball\\" also illustrates some important lessons of business management, in particular how people react to change.  I recommend it for most, but wouldn't rank it among the all-time great baseball movies.  One other interesting (non-spoiler) aspect of the film: Brad Pitt is now old enough that they had to find a younger, similar-looking actor to portray the early-twenties version of Pitt's character. Evidently the miracles of Hollywood makeup artistry are not enough to make Brad Pitt look like a 20 year-old any more.

B005IZJH38|2.0|I just began reading this book, and immediately, I picked up lots of typos in just 2 pages:<br /><br />Among, spelled \\"Amnng\\" (I mistook this typo for a name and had the re-read the sentence several times to figure it out)<br />the name, spelled \\"thename\\"<br />execution was, spelled \\"executionwas\\"<br />as a, spelled \\"asa\\"<br />him on, spelled \\"himon\\"<br /><br />Perhaps this carelessness reflects the publisher's disrespect toward the author?<br />Now, These typos all appear in the publisher's add-on background information, which is made to help us understand Mein Kampf better. But still, I expect better works from a $3 buy. And although I'm not a big fan of Hitler, I do expect a historical document to be exact and mistake-free. That expectation is completely extinguished by these typos.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I had never heard of Firefly until recently (September 2011).  Sorry I missed it.<br /><br />In the year 2517, after humans arrive in a new star system, the renegrade crew of Serenity (a Firefly-class spacecraft) struggle to survive, making a living on the outskirts of the star system.  Some fought on the losing side of the unification war.  The characters, especially the main character, seem a little cavalier at first, but they are diverse and interesting and grow on you.  Firefly has action and humor, so you get some plot contrivances, but on the whole it is good.  Episode plots vary and get better as the season progresses: the last episode is actually the best (based on DVD set).<br /><br />Firefly is a project of Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  If you like Firefly, try the movie Serenity, a followup to the Firefly series.

B0050R0YB8|5.0|edit: I have edited my STAR rating from 3 stars to 5, to counterbalance the negative price reviews from people complaining about the 3rd party sellers with the higher prices.  Which of course is now out of date since Amazon itself now carries this set.  I still think the set itself deserves 3 stars, but the other reviewers complaining about the prices need someone to counter them.<br /><br />----- Original Review -----<br /><br />Ok, about me... I built the original UCS ISD, the UCS Falcon, the UCS Death Star...  I'm a Star Wars nut, what can I say...  :)<br /><br />It is by far the worst of the bunch, it is a terrible value at $399 for 3,100 gray bricks and a set that is really just a display.<br />The 10188 Death Star has 700 more parts, 24 minifigs, and can be played with, for the same money. Or for $239 you get 4,200 parts with the Tower Bridge, that honestly looks better in person due to the colors.<br /><br />Ok, so the SSD is a great idea, I was waiting for this for 10 years, but the ship is just too long compared to the height and length to make a good model.  That isn't Lego's fault, they have to build what ILM did with the ship model from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, the model is just very long and narrow and short, compared to the model for the Imperial Star Destroyer.<br /><br />To do this justice, it needed to be twice the size (8 to 10 feet long), with about 7,000 bricks, then Lego could have charged $599 and sold a ton of them. The other thing is it needed a hanger deck to give it something to play with, perhaps a bridge\detention center section as well so it had something to do, rather than just sit there.  If it had been made larger, there would be \\"play\\" room inside of it, instead of it just being a display set.<br /><br />At $299, I would buy this, at $399, pass until it is on sale....<br /><br />Of course, UCS sets seem to sell for about 3 years, so 3 years from now this may seem like a bargain compared to the sets that will come out in 2014, so at that point perhaps the value equation will change.  10188 probably seemed expensive when it came out in 2008 and 10179 sure seemed expensive when it came out in 2007, but those two turned out to be great values.  Only time will tell here.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From cover to cover you are entertained by the complax personality of Katniss and her struggle to find herself while taking care of everyone she loves. As her situation becomes harder she confuses herself with all of the parts she needs to play not only for her own survival, but for her own emotional well-being. It is one of the best books I have read and it also left me questioning what I would do, given the same situations. There are so many intertwined themes and topics that intermingled as well. Society vs. the individual good, the role of the media, the impact of fashion, governments role and controls, and the individual family unit. There is no clear cut black and white, good or bad, this book lives in the gray area and that is why it is so compelling. I'm so excited about the next two!
B001AIRUOU|4.0|I am very pleased with the quality of this DvD. Tim Burton's Stop motion work in this movie is phenomanal. I hadn't seen it in a very long time though, so it was a little creepier than i remembered, but it still an excellent addition to my DvD collection.
0670022411|3.0|This was this month's book club selection and I totally groaned when I read the title, but ended up liking it somewhat, much to my surprise. The book club hostess told us it was \\"historical fiction,\\" which is quite a stretch. It's primarily a supernatural romance, but it is better written than the Twilight series. The storyline was interesting, but the author really dragged things out unnecessarily; it seemed as though she thought a longer book equalled a better story. There were too many mind-numbing details about Diana's voracious appetite and what vampires ate (over and over again), what people were wearing, numerous yoga classes....ok, ok! Honestly, I would have liked the book much better if someone had taken an editing pen and scratched out 150-200 pages of excess material out of the book. I also hope the Clairmonts will take Diana shopping before the next book so she has something to wear besides old black leggings and sweatshirts; seriously what would she wear for her big presentation?!  Anyhow, aside from the excessive detail, there is a decent romantic story and interesting characters. This is an entertaining read and I liked it enough to want to read the second book.

The voice is smooth and the styling is all his own.  I love this CD and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre of music.  The price was unbelievable - under $8.00 for this gem...thank you Amazon!!!
0780622650|3.0|Producer Irwin Allen took the concept of the Swiss Family Robinson, where a family was shipwrecked on an island, and set it in outer space for his TV series Lost In Space (1965-68), which featured another Robinson family, struggling to make their way back to Earth.  With a solid fan base, a high tech adaptation to the big screen was proposition with great potential.  Written by noted writer Akiva Goldsman (Oscar winner for A Beautiful Mind), the movie's screenplay incorporates many elements from the original series, into a convoluted story that is perhaps too tightly focused on family issues.<br /><br />It's 2058, and in order to survive, the people of Earth need to migrate to the planet Alpha Prime.  The Robinson Family, led by Professor John Robinson (John Hurt) are to take the spaceship Jupiter 2 on a ten year journey to Alpha Prime, and upon arrival, help construct a hypergate which will facilitate colonization of the planet.  Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc) will be the pilot.  Also on the mission are Robinson's wife Maureen (Mimi Rogers), his daughter Judy (Heather Graham) a physician, his teenage daughter Penny (Lacy Chabert), his attention craving son Will (Jack Johnson), and a robot (featuring the voice of Dick Tufeld, who also voiced the robot in the original series).<br /><br />Saboteur Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) sneaks aboard the Jupiter 2, and reprograms the robot to destroy the ship while the crew is in cryo-statis.  Smith is betrayed, and finds himself aboard as the robot attempts to carry out his orders.  He awakens the crew in order to save his life.  After neutralizing the robot, Robinson finds that Jupiter 2 is being drawn into the sun, and with no other option, makes a jump through hyperspace.<br /><br />Emerging from the jump in an unknown part of the galaxy, the Jupiter 2 soon discovers the Proteus, another spacecraft from Earth.  Boarding the craft, the crew finds it deserted, but uncover evidence that the ship was sent to rescue them.  West captures a strange alien creature, which Penny later adopts as her pet.  Suddenly spiderlike alien creatures appear, forcing the humans to return to their ship.  With the aliens able to floating through space, West initiates the ill advised destruction of the Proteus, which causes an explosion that sends the Jupiter 2 crash landing on a nearby planet.<br /><br />Directed by Stephen Hopkins (Predator 2), Lost In Space starts out rather well, but the screenplay soon begins to fragment apart.  The Jupiter 2 is too larger, for a ship supposedly being used for basic transport.  The Robinsons try hard, but are ill prepared to operate the spacecraft, and not trained for basic operations like the boarding of the Proteus, where they stupidly include Smith.<br /><br />John Robinson's neglect of his son, is one of the main themes, but the truth is he has hardly any time for anyone in his family.  With the fate of the Earth on the line, this just emphasizes how silly the premise of selecting a family for such a mission is.  Robinson repeatedly demonstrates that he is not prepared to handle the situations that arise, and it doesn't help that West is a hothead, whose poor judgment causes the ship to be wrecked.  What happens on the planet involving a quest for fuel, and the discovery of beings from the future, including one who is a human spider, is ridiculously awful.  The special effects may impress, but they can't compensate for a story that just seems to wind itself into a knot, and crush much of the faint credibility the film started with.  With a galaxy of possibilities, to have matters come down to a desire to return to a dying Earth, is either brilliant irony, or complete foolishness.<br /><br />The cast is talented, but some of them seem miscast.  William Hurt often gives understated performances, but he's not a very inspiring leader here.  Gary Oldman's Dr. Smith exhibits few of the sniveling qualities of Jonathan Harris, but his overdramatic antics provide what little color there is.  Mimi Rogers is underused, and someone who could play a physician, but it's hard to buy Heather Graham in that role.  Lacy Chabert's talents are frittered away as much of Penny's time is spent with Blarp, the silly alien creature, designed to appease kids.  Matt LeBlanc fills the uniform well, but exhibits far too many schoolboy tendencies.  As Will, Jack Johnson is endearing at times, but the character is also quite annoying as well.  Angela Cartwright, Marta Kristen, June Lockhart, and Mark Goddard, from the original series make cameo appearances.  Notably absent is Billy Mumy the original Will Robinson, and Jonathan Harris reportedly declined a cameo role.<br /><br />With a budget upwards of $70 million, Lost In Space puts tons of money into sets, ships, CGI and other special effects.  However coming up with a stronger story, might have been a much better investment, as this film is just another botched movie adaptation of a classic TV series.someone who could play a physician, but it's hard to buy Heather Graham in that role.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Audio quality is sufficient, and I feel it's better than the default audio on my camera. I would recommend getting some new batteries when ordering this microphone because the one they include is already inside the device. If it's been on a shelf for a long time, the battery will already be drained down a bit.<br /><br />When using, make sure you have it close to what you're recording; it won't do well if placed far from the source. For the money, this is a great value.

B0054N73EY|3.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been around for a long time.  And for that long time they have made a lot of pretty good music.  They are one of my favorite bands out there as you always know what you're going to get from them.    \\"I'm With You\\" is no different, just not as good.  The first single has their usual melody and sound and it sets the stage for what most of the rest of the album sounds like, but not quite.  I'm not going to get into each song specifically as the album sort of blends together and they don't differentiate too much.  That is not a bad thing, but there is little that stands out on the album.  The overall recording quality does not seem up to par with RHCP work in the past.  I expect the sound quality to play over the speakers better but that could just be me.  Expect a decent RHCP album, and if you like them you should like this, but don't expect anything ground breaking nor as good as the band's work in the past.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions represented an interesting point in madonnas career. Her previous album, the politically charged American Life, was arguably her least commercial and it failed on the charts, at least in comparison to her usual high standard of sales. In addition, the liberal viewpoint madonna expressed with the album angered studio executives in america and it was rumored that she was blacklisted.  Her many haters rejoiced; the queen was finally going to be placed in her coffin. So along comes Confessions On a Dance floor, and with this album Madonna bursts open from her casket with the disco ball blaring.  The sound of this record is both unexpected and also a perfect stepping stone from her previous album. It was marketed and perceived by some as Madonna selling out in the name of career longevity, as she tossed her american life Che Guevara look in the trash and replaced it with a abba esque pink leotard. But Madonna will always be Madonna and this album is more than meets the eye. Despite the outward appearance of escapism, the lyrics touch upon the introspective themes of materialism that were dwelled upon in American Life. It also is littered with lessons regarding love, materialism, and the meaning of life.  \\"How High\\" illustrates the perfect example of this; as a dance workout type song it's a complete home run but the lyrics reflect madonna expressing a deep sadness for the choices made in her life. She questions the merit of her accomplishments and the sacrifices she has made to last as long as she has. The lyrics reflect a insecurity that is rather shocking. To hear someone in the position she is in speak so honestly about the punches she has had to endure is enlightening. Like It or not takes a similar tone, with Madonna stating self defiantly that she is who she is and she will change for no one.  On a less serious note, Madonna also has the sense to know her audience. And her audience wants sexy dance number, no excuses! One of the reasons Madonna has lasted as long as she has is that she knows what people love about her and she delivers. She pulls out all the stops for tracks like \\"Get Together\\", which could be described as a dance floor giving you a big wet kiss, while \\"Future Lovers\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\" make up for in booty shaking appeal what they lack in depth. But the production is outstanding...credit to stuart price for making this album sound state of the art even in 2011.  Madonna can count another notch in her belt, for with this album, she yet again beat the odds and had another hit record. American Life was a dreary affair and with this album she still asks the same questions, but this time also expresses the self confidence to simply dance and sing and get up and do your thing. For Madonna to return and have another triumphant comeback, in the face of the hatred she faced is utterly inspiring. She was as good as dead and she came right back and her presence shut the mouths of her competitors. It's not just about the image or the attitude, it's about the music and it's honestly shocking how on point this record is.

0385534639|3.0|The Night Circus was a big disappointment for me. I won't describe the plot because others have already done so and those descriptions can be found in other reviews. Overall, I felt that the \\"plot\\" was very disjunctive and that the reader never fully understands what is going on or why certain events might be important.   When I was reading the book it felt more like a collection of short stories rather than a cohesive novel. In addition, two aspects of the book were a huge turn-off to me: first, there are a large number of characters in this book and not one of them is fully-fleshed out. They are all flat, one-dimensional, boring characters. Second, each chapter begins in a different year and different location from the one before it. As a result, the story line jumps all over the place and it took a long time to get used to that style of writing. In the beginning of the book I found myself flipping back and forth between the earlier chapters I'd read to ensure that I knew where I was supposed to be in the story.   With that said, I did read it to the end and thought that the story was an interesting one. It kept my attention and I did want to see what happened to each of the characters. All in all, this is a book that, in my opinion, was all about style and not substance. It has no depth. The reader is never given an opportunity to full understand the circus and the challenge that goes on in, and for that I give the book 3 stars.

B0049M7BDE|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 'BLU RAY' VERSION ***<br /><br />Armed with nothing more sinister than a plain croissant and a nondescript briefcase beneath his seat, billionaire Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) sits in the Impressionist Gallery of New York's Metropolitan Museum staring at \\"Noon: Rest From Work (After Millet)\\" by Vincent Van Gogh. Approaching from behind comes Bobby the Principal Security Guard (played by Michael Lombard) who then smiles at Crown. It pleases him to see one of the exhibits regular patrons sat in his usual place being no trouble to nobody. But then Bobby is curious...<br /><br />Immediately to the right of Van Gogh's 'haystacks' (as his immaculately dressed art-lover calls it) is a painting that would surely appeal to the 42-year old far more - Claude Monet's \\"San Giorgio Maggiore At Dusk\\". But no, Thomas is unmoved. Bobby presses and tells him it's worth a cool $100 million dollars. But again - Thomas is not impressed. Crown then sighs - and staring with great discipline at the Van Gogh immediately in front of him - he says, \\"It's nice Bobby. It is. But I like my haystacks...\\" The Security Guard smiles, shrugs his shoulders and walks away admiring Thomas Crown's honesty.<br /><br />A few hours later a 20th Century Greco Asian Horse arrives in a pallet downstairs instead of an Etruscan Sarcophagus - a 'disparity' perhaps? Or perhaps Bobby needs to go to character assessment classes more often...<br /><br />In 1998 Pierce Brosnan and his production company \\"Irish Dreamtime\\" wisely decided to remake the sophisticated 1969 playboy heist movie \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" which originally starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway - cleverly giving Dunaway the part of Crown's therapist in the new version. It was a genius move. Already beginning to be straight-jacketed by Bond, Brosnan showed that not only could he pull off a leading man in another film, but he could do it with more style and panache than most of Hollywood's elite. Remake or no - the result was a critical and commercial winner that sizzled with both sex and sexiness.<br /><br />Containing both of these - and a great deal more - up steps the movie's other secret weapon - actress Rene Russo playing a super-savvy Insurance Agent called Catherine Banning. The chemistry between her and Brosnan was so sensational it set tongues wagging globally (\\"Will you get me? Oh I hope so...\\"). But with all of this loaded dialogue - promptly followed by sweaty shenanigans on the marble staircase - the movie desperately needed some serious grounding and the occasional laugh. For this they added in the wonderful Denis Leary as Detective Michael McCann (...\\"some of these broads are wearing my salary...\\") and Frankie Faison as his partner Detective Paretti. Their sparring with the smarter Russo character (some of her dialogue titles this review) is magical and so deftly handled.<br /><br />Also blessed with a brilliantly-written and cleverly plotted script by Lesley Dixon and Kurt Wilmer, great original music by Bill Conti and expert Direction by John McTiernan - \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" was quite rightly hailed as a fantastic piece of cinema.<br /><br />Which brings us to this BLU RAY reissue. Its default aspect is 2.35:1 (bars on the top and bottom), but even stretched to full screen - it holds its shape, is detailed and clean. I'm also thrilled to say that the picture upgrade is obvious even as the credits roll. It never looks anything less than great and at times (close-ups of suits, faces in restaurants, her slinky gowns) it looks beautiful. Even in the Museum Basement sequences - which are dark and faintly lit - the print is still superbly clear.<br /><br />Niggles - the Blu Ray is an American-only issue at the moment, but it is an 'all regions' disc - which means it plays on all players. Some have found that this isn't the case, but it did on my mine without any fuss whatsoever - so check your machine. The other major let down is the complete absence of any extras - not even a trailer. But - by way of small consolation - the disc is mid-price so can be had for less than a tenner...<br /><br />To sum up - 12-years haven't diminished the entertainment value of this fantastic remake one jot. And despite the disappointing lack of extras - the truly superb upgrade in picture quality and reasonable price - should convince fans and newcomers alike to put this Blu Ray repurchase high on their wish list.

He is simply trying to enhance things with present day technology that simply wasn't available decades ago.<br /><br />Is it perfect?  Nope.  If you're looking for perfection, go make a film yourself so the rest of us can laugh at your works.  So Vader now says \\"No\\" at the sight of his son being killed . . . \\"Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!\\".  Get a grip.  This detracts from nothing, except the absurd ego's of anal fan boys who want what they want or they'll hold their breath.  Yawn.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is still the Star Wars saga.  The greatest saga yet in the Sci-Fi genre.  It's in Blu-Ray, the highest resolution available.  Relax and enjoy it.  Life's too short to whine at every little thing you don't like.  The whole thing is FICTION.  That means none of it is real, so stop complaining that something was altered.  It wasn't real the first time around!  Duh?

If you're looking for a more heartfelt slower ballad, or two songs that you can absolutely fall in love with that talk about something we've all experienced or hope to experience, \\"Just A Kiss\\" and \\"Heart of the World\\" are your picks. My personal favorite is \\"Heart of the World\\" - this has EASILY now become my favorite love song second only to \\"Just A Kiss\\".

B00005JL78|4.0|First, why shouldn't I like this movie... Steven Spielberg, Dreamworks, Tom Cruise.  I've said enough in that regard.  The story still wins through in spite of the generic script, generic acting, and implausible production team.  The old woman in the garden of living plants makes the movie worth watching alone.  The rest, somewhat not what I'd expect from a movie based on philip k. dick short story.  Can still watch, albeit with occasional bouts of doubt.  Not dark enough, in other words.  Is it worth getting special edition?  Is it ever?
B00003CXCD|5.0|I knew very little about \\"Roman Holiday\\" when I settled down to watch it, beyond knowing that it starred Audrey Hepburn, involved a Vespa, and was considered one of the great love stories in cinematic history. I was definitely in for a treat as I watched the story unfold, for although the basic premise of \\"royalty incognito\\" is hardly unique, \\"Roman Holiday\\" still holds up today as an incredibly charming, memorable and bittersweet love story.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn plays Princess Anne of Unspecified Country, on a whirlwind goodwill tour around Europe. By the time she reaches Rome, Anne is feeling stifled by the endless schedules that dictate every moment of her life, and finally cracks under the pressure. Administered a sedative by the doctor, Anne waits until she's alone before escaping from the embassy grounds, only to find herself alone and doped up on the streets of Rome.<br /><br />Meanwhile, journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) wanders home from a poker match to find Anne muttering incoherently on a bench. Unable to get an address out of her, he eventually takes her home to his apartment. Like a perfect gentleman (well, maybe not a *perfect* gentleman - he rolls her onto a couch so that he can keep the bed for himself) lets her sleep off what he thinks is drunkenness. By the next day Anne has recovered, and Joe has recognized her as the Princess Anne. Realizing that he has the scoop of his lifetime, he contacts his photographer friend Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) and convinces Anne to take the day off with him in Rome.<br /><br />What follows is a magical day in the Eternal City, but as the hours lengthen so too does the couple's realization that their separation is imminent. Though most of the film is an unashamed romantic-comedy involving subterfuge, haircuts, dancing, street brawls, pranks (Anne's reaction to Joe's missing hand at the Mouth of Truth was genuine; Peck hadn't told Hepburn what he was going to do) and of course the famous Vespa ride, it all builds toward a bittersweet conclusion that cements the movie's reputation as a genuine tear-jerker.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn is elegant and wide-eyed, poised and beguiling as Anne, the role that won her an Oscar and catapulted her into stardom. Though she had featured in a few films prior to this, \\"Roman Holiday\\" was her first starring role, and it was on Gregory Peck's insistence that her name be elevated alongside his for the promotional material. As Joe Bradley, Peck takes a backseat to Hepburn (though he *owns* the final scene), whose role is mainly to provide Anne with a safe chaperone with which to see the city. Eddie Albert has the final major role as Joe's hapless photographer, stumbling through a number of pratfalls as his college tries to keep him from giving too much away.<br /><br />At the time (1953), location shooting was rare, leading to a disclaimer at the start of the film as to the veracity of the shots. Director William Wyler used places like the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, and the Bocca della Verita (\\"Mouth of Truth\\") to excellent effect in demonstrating the scope and atmosphere of Rome. Also worth noting is that though the screenwriting credit goes to Ian McLellan Hunter, it was actually Dalton Trumbo who penned the script. Hunter fronted for him after Trumbo was blacklisted, and his name has only recently been reinstated to the credits on these DVD releases.<br /><br />At times, the film shows its age. The portrayal of Italians is inevitably stereotypical (though positive), and the romance between Anne and the significantly older Joe has a paternal quality to it. Joe often comes across as quite fatherly toward Anne, not helped by the fact that her cover story is that she's a runaway schoolgirl. But in saying that, there are some rather surprising implications at work. Contemporary viewers often assume that old films are free of innuendo or sexual content - yet here we see that the first thing Anne doeson waking up in Joe's apartment is to worriedly check that she's wearing pajama bottoms whilst Joe innocently asks: \\"did you lose something?\\" Later Joe is acutely aware of the conclusions that his landlord is jumping to when he's seen giving Anne some money.<br /><br />Still, it's all fairly innocuous, and it made me wonder what \\"Roman Holiday\\" would be like if it was filmed today. Anne would be a bratty teenager who lashes out at her chaperones, and Joe would be an ambitious reporter who ruthlessly exploits her. They would undoubtedly sleep together and Anne would wake up in the morning to discover that Joe was a reporter, leading to a screaming argument, a desperate attempt on Joe's behalf to make amends (no doubt involving a chase scene on a Vespa through the busy streets after her entourage), and a saccharine \\"fairytale\\" ending that would allow the couple to be together no matter how preposterous the circumstances.<br /><br />They just don't make them like they used to, and it continues to amaze me that compared with today's standards, the romantic-comedies of old manage to be both more innocent and more sophisticated than the rubbish that gets churned out these days.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Roman Holiday\\" is about two things: love, which manages to be both ephemeral and immortal, contained forever in the secret memory of one perfect day, and the growth from a girl to a woman - the Anne at the end of the film is far more assertive and in control, and for the first time you can see as the future Queen of Unspecified Country.she's wearing pajama bottoms whilst Joe innocently asks: \\"did you lose something?\\" Later Joe is acutely aware of the conclusions that his landlord is jumping to when he's seen giving Anne some money.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|These movies are fantastic! If you are just looking for a basic set I think it's a good value, since with Amazon's $89.99 price right now, that comes out to only just over $10 for each movie.
0143038419|2.0|I will begin with some positive words: this book is well written & appears to be intended to produce positive feelings.     Negatives: The book is boring. I could not 'get into' the main character-Elizabeth Gilbert (the author.) I found her personality to be insecure, privileged & boring. I read the book because it came recommended to me by a few of my female friends. I stopped reading it in the middle of India but I have NEVER not finished a book & after I read a different book, I went back to the book. Within two pages of reading, I came to the same conclusion- I just don't like this book. I find it difficult to identify with. I have traveled to many countries, studied yoga since 1996 & had lived through too many trials & tribulations. Still, there is something about this author & her being the main subject of the book that irritated me to no end & I just could not be one with her. I now have finished India & cannot bring myself to read anymore, though I will try.   I don't know if this is helpful because I know many people really enjoyed this book. I would not recommend this book.

B003L77GGK|5.0|If I had to compare this season to a movie in a series, it probably be Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You know that the stakes are high in the movie and that the fate of the world hangs on the balance with John Conner and \\"Ah-nold,\\" but you just never take as seriously as T2 because every other scene has you bursting with laughter. Well this show had me laughing in EVERY episode...but in a good way.<br /><br />The story line for this season is good, but in my opinion not as \\"stakes are so high\\" story-lines as season 2, 3, 4, and 5. In fact I felt that this season took the story to a more personal importance, along the lines of season 1 and 3 as opposed to \\"oh no the world is coming to an end, we have to figure out a way to stop it!\\" Season 1 was trying to figure out where the brothers stood in terms of fighting the yellow-eyed demon, and season 3 was Sam trying to find a way to save his brother Dean from going to hell, and I felt the same type of personal urgency from this season as those two seasons.<br /><br />This time Dean has to save Sam (spoiler alert!) by finding his soul. Sam is a walking, empty husk with no soul inside, but also an emotionless, uncaring psychopath who will do anything to finish a \\"job\\" - even risking the life of his own brother Dean. So you can imagine how much personal conflicts arise with this predicament and how many times the show can get really emotional. However, at the same time I have to say that this season was also the funniest season.<br /><br />For example, looking at the \\"The French Mistake\\" episode, (where the brothers go to an alternate reality where they find they are only actors named Jensen/ Jared who only act like they are killing monsters and there are no real monsters, demons, or angels) where the two brothers spend nearly 5 minutes doing a take on a scene over and over again, which was handled brilliantly by Jensen/ Jared. The two actors acted so well that they didn't know how to act that it was believable and kept me laughing for the duration of the scene. I haven't laughed like that since Will Farell was having a heartfelt convo in a fish suit with his basketball team in \\"Semi-pro.\\"<br /><br />All in all, I would not say that this season was the BEST season out of the 6, but you can tell the producers were trying to approach season six a little bit differently than seasons 4 and 5, where nearly the whole season had apocalyptic feel. This one was more like - hm, things are pretty bad, but the brothers are having fun while they're trying to figure things out and get to know each other all over again. Don't get me wrong, this season has drama like the previous seasons, but it was refreshing to get away from the whole apocalyptic sense and see the brothers interact more leisurely rather than think the clock was always against them because...season 7 is gonna get REAL apocalyptic (BIG spoiler alert) with Castiel becoming god-like/ insane towards the end of season 6.t me laughing for the duration of the scene.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|There are only two changes in this movie that bother me: Greedo shooting first, and Darth Vader shouting \\"Nooo\\" when he kills the Emperor in ROTJ.  This amounts to less than 10 seconds of film in a series that runs nearly 13 hours.  For me, that's not enough reason to just discard the whole product.  The picture is great, the sound is great, and it's loaded with some great extras.<br /><br />The final disc, Documentaries and Spoofs, could have been better.  Only a few of the spoofs are funny, and they are not separated in chapters, so you can't jump to the particular one that you want to see.  It would also have been nice to see the \\"Empire of Dreams\\" documentary included.
B003L77GRY|5.0|Review not really needed, its Dexter.  5 stars all the way.  This was an interesting season though and Julia Stiles was fantastic.  Such a perfect role for her and she plays it so well.  A must for the collection.

B003E1G4AC|4.0|So I love how it looks on my desk.  Love the extra usb ports.  Hate the sounds.  When you plug or unplug a device it plays r2d2 sounds for a good minute.  There is pauses between the sounds and each time you think its finished when it's just getting started.  Plugging stuff in before you turn your computer on is the best bet.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|If you want a light-hearted superhero movie, this is great. It's a silly movie that knows it's silly. The characters even tell you so a couple times. Still, sometimes the costumes were a bit too much for me. The soundtrack is awesome, another reason to buy this.  * spoiler alert * I really like the \\"villain.\\" I didn't think he was a villain at all after he explained his highly interesting plot. He basically saved his homeland and should have been regarded as a hero, too. I wish the other characters appreciated him more and that he could have had a happy ending, but of course not, which is why this does not get 5 stars from me.

0385341008|5.0|Originally when I picked the book up a few years ago at the library, I chose it because of the title.  I loved the letter format.  The interaction of the characters was believable, warm and funny.  I was also interested in what the people of the Channel Islands went through during WW II.  Recently, I talked my book club into reading the book.  Hence, the purchase. (The book club hasn't met yet, but 2 have said it is a new favorite.  I liked the book so much I reread it & I very seldom reread a book! (too many I haven't read  I wanted this book for my very small fiction collection.

This is THE easiest game to control.  I wish all apps were of this level of quality.
B004XCUEXY|5.0|Dave Grohl really puts his heart and soul into everything he does. If you didn't know that prior to going into Foo Fighters Back and Forth documentary you will be sure of it after viewing it. And this video is really The History of Dave Grohl as much as it is about the Foo Fighters.<br /><br />The DVD starts with a young Grohl joining Nirvana and reveals a lot of inside story about the dynamic of that band and its tragic end. Then the real fun starts as Dave lays it all out there from getting the Foo Fighters together through getting the first album out through the many intricacies and trials and tribulations of the band to the current day and the release of Wasting Light.<br /><br />Let me tell you, friends and neighbors...this video affected me. I don't know if it affected me so much because [[ASIN:B004LUHQ1G Wasting Light]] also so affected me, or if it's that I'll be seeing the Foo's for my first time next month, or perhaps I just related to a lot of the experiences as a musician myself (failed musician but musician nonetheless!). But this video affected me. I rocked. I laughed. I rocked. I got disappointed. I rocked. I even got friggin emotional at one point! And I'm no Foo Fighters fan boy; I've been critical of the group for putting out records that have a few great songs and a lot of forgettable songs. However the band really turned that corner for me with Wasting Light, which has track after track of great songs.<br /><br />Foo Fighters Back and Forth is a must for Foo Fighters fans, but maybe even more so for anyone who's ever wanted to know how to make a good band and then make that good band persevere through it all to greatness.<br /><br />Side note: The DVD does NOT include the live studio performance of the entire Wasting Light album that was shown in theaters along side the Back and Forth documentary. That's kind of a bummer, because it is an excellent little show and an intimate look at the band playing the album together. Fortunately the Foo Fighters have the Wasting Light live performance posted on YouTube...in HD!

B001RTIHPS|1.0|Ok this is the worst Smallville episode I've ever seen.  First of all I wish Lana would have died in season 4, I feel like vomiting every time I see Lana and Clark in the barn at the end of an episode.  This one however takes the cake for the worst of them all.  I like a good love/tragedy story, too bad this doesn't fall in the category of \\"good\\", just moronic.  Well hopefully we get to see some better episodes in the future!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Michael's career will never be over as long as there is one iota of a person who still loves and adores his work, as well as the human being. Michael is no prima donna by any means, and he appears like someone you could easily talk to as a friend if you are friends with him. His talent is second nature to him like breathing and eating, all he has to do is to present it in perfected mode for a dynamite act that will wow em in the audience.<br />The advantage here, although I wish he could have completed his tour as scheduled, is we as an audience not only get to see the rehearsals for his dynamite swan song concert, but the vibrations and chemistry of the inside look towards his backups, dancers, and studio technicians which might have been completely overlooked in the main event. What is the validity to this? Michael himself that this quote unquote \\"This Is It\\" mission is the final hour for his days of touring shows. On the brief other hand, we have aspiring new talent who have emulated Michael all their lives, and now have a chance to glow beside him. This is their hour as well, to glow on stage next to the master. It is this factor that makes this video a class all its own outside of another dress rehearsal of a major pop star. If you could eclipse the events that led to his accidental death just for a moment, we see the mega talent of yesterday colliding with the new world of today. Michael himself said his songs were possibly outdated since they are almost entirely devoid of any kind of rap labels of today. This should not concern him, however, since even the most rap star bros cannot do anything but see Michael as the ongoing mega star he is, and you can tell quite plainly by their reverence in talking to him while rehearsing through the numbers one at a time.<br />Excellent documentary video, and probably a better concert with vast chemistry other than a dynamic performance by all, and the technicians left in the dark.

I will keep this short and sweet and to the point ,this blu-ray is good enough to own, but this is not the best transfer i have seen, but it isn't the worst.  Its still better than DVD but no where near the top quality i have seen on blu-ray. On a high note the sound is the best i have listened to on a 5.1 system just incredible. All in all i am very happy with my purchase, and can recommend this collection to anyone.
0783225857|3.0|Love this movie.  Read the book with son #1 and decided he needed to see this classic.  The video is good but the sound isn't.  It went from loud (when there was music)to extremely low.  At one point we had the TV volume up as high as it would go and still had trouble making out the dialogue.  Bummer.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is fun, unique, and I love the music as well. Helps me pass time when I'm bored. And also it is just super cute.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|After waiting several months, the Blu-ray edition of Star Wars is here.  I promised that I would not write any kind of review until I had seen all six pictures of the series at least once.    Episode I  Visuals & audio:  Both greatly superior to the DVD.  A grossly over-exposed scene of the city on the DVD was corrected  here and  the landscaping and architecture are breath-taking.  Audio is very good.  Sound of explosions have real bass fundementals unlike the DVD.  I'll have more to say about the music later.  Story and acting: Probably the weakest of the six in both respects.  Neeson and McGregor are always good as you would expect.  Natalie Portman is irritating in this one.  She mumbles and whines through her dialog and nobody seemed to be there to correct her.  I realize that she is supposed to be hiding the fact that she is actually the Queen but at least she could have spoken distinctly.  Jake Lloyd as young Anakin Skywalker was a big mistake -- a cute little boy who runs around saying \\"yippee!\\"and his characterization is not convincing.  A much better choice,  for that part would have been young Daniel Logan who played Boba Fett in Episode II; he had the demeanor and appearance far more consistent with the character he would ultimately become and he was still young enough for the part at that time.  Every time I see him in Episode II I think, there's the kid who should have played Anakin.  The pod race is a little long but for some reason the sound effects are less irritating here than with the DVD.  Special effect are marvelous and  what you would hope for with Lucas' technology by this time.  Episode II  Visuals & audio: Some of the night scenes in this are really dark -- probably more like the original film was.  I made it a point to watch all of these films in a totally dark room.  The DVD probably had compressed contrast to make it more suitable for its time.  Audio is very good -- the music and sound effects in the entire series never override the dialog which is clear and understandable at all times.  The sibilance components of the dialog are always clear providing better intelligibility.    Story and acting.  Portman improved slightly, but the romance scenes are unendurable.  Hayden Christensen is awful here, reciting his dialog without conviction and putting stresses on the wrong words.  Lucas is to blame for a lot of this: He wrote the story and directed the films.  He should not have allowed these sort of things to get away from him.  Special effects are great-- the car chase at the beginning and the monster battles and rescue at the end are unbelieveable and look splendid here. The monster battle at the stadium was, supposedly, a tribute to Ray Harryhausen, the master of stop-action animation.  Episode III  Visuals & audio:  Looks wonderful but is not that much of an improvement over the DVD.  DVD mastering had come a long way by the time this picture was released although the DTS sound of the Blu-ray cannot be matched by the DVD.  The scenes of cityscape and futuristic architecture in this episode and Episode II simply cannot be believed and are especially striking with the resolution of Blu-ray.    Story and acting:  Natalie Portman had improved greatly, bringing real humanity to her character.  I  can say the same but to a slightly lesser degree for Christensen.  Obviously a lot of coaching went on between films.  The story is very good and neatly ties into episode IV which follows.   Episode IV    I watched the series in this order because I wanted to see how bad this episode was going to look compared with episode III.  Not a bit of it!  Visuals & audio:  The restoration of this film is nothing short of a miracle in picture and sound.  John Williams composed some his most ravishingly beautiful music for this film.  Like the opera cycle \\"The Ring of the Nibelungs\\" by Richard Wagner (sort of his \\"Star Wars\\"), Williams composed specific themes or leitmotifs to pertain to his characters: Luke Skywalker,Princess Leia, Darth Vader and even Han Solo have their own musical themes which are recalled in the orchestra when they are the center of attention.  At 40:48 when Luke sees his dead parents and burned home, the horns (French horns as most people incorrectly call them) sound a theme that is one of the main themes Williams uses in \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\\"  The  film does not seem old at all having rich detail and wonderful sound quality.  However, I was a little irked to discover that the average volume level of this episode is a full 8 to 10 decibels higher than episode III.  That's a lot and it means you cannot use the same volume setting for all the films in this series and get the same effect, which I find rather irritating.  The entire episode, including the dialog, is at a higher average volume level than the preceding episode and the reason why this would be necessary or overlooked eludes me.    Story and acting:  Luke Skywalker is portrayed by Mark Hamill initially as a young man with no sense of purpose which is what I assume Lucas wanted him to be. But is does bother me to hear him say, \\"But it's a whole nother year.\\"  This being said on a planet far, far away?  Princess Leia Organa: Carrie Fisher is OK here but her British accent keeps coming and going.  Harrison Ford and particularly Alec Guinness bring a huge amount to this film.  Even at Guinness' advanced age, his dialog rolls out of  him effortlessly and totally believably.  The special effects were groundbreaking for this time even though Lucas was operating on a strict budget.  The final battle scene, no matter how many times you have watched it is still a nail biter. This was of course the first film originally released in 1977 that we all came to know and love.  Changes/alterations:  I don't have any qualms over the little additions Lucas put into this film.  They enrich it a bit.  We get an elevation view and other details of the architecture of the Mos Eisley Spaceport which I regard as a real improvement in helping dispel the impression that it is simply a movie set.  The CG of Jabba the Hutt was a good idea -- at least we now know what he looked like.  Han Solo walking behind him and stepping on his rear quarter is quite funny if you catch it.  Jabba in this episode seems quite friendly toward Han Solo in this scene.  In most of Jabba's other scenes he is a crazed Caligula-like dictator.  I'm not sure most people will even catch some of these modifications, except for those who have made a life study of these movies.    Episode V  Visuals and audio:  Here I noticed quite a difference in clarity between the scenes shot on set which are crystal clear and the multiple element space battle scene which look a little soft in focus compared to any of the other films.  This episode contains some of Williams' most majestic music, showing off the wonderful brass section of the The London Symphony,  certainly one of the world's finest orchestras.  Who ever decided on that orchestra certainly made the right move.  It brings a great deal to these films.  So far I haven't seen any reviews mentioning the music or the great orchestral playing of it.  It's nice to see they at least got a credit, considering what they contributed to these films.  Story and acting:  Probably the best of the lot in most respects.  Hamill, Fisher and Ford have enriched their characters greatly.  The story is probably the most powerful of the six.    Changes/Alterations: These appear to be limited to the few inserts made in the \\"Cloud City\\" scenes, which, again, I think improve on the original film, the the teeth gnashing and moaning of the devotees to the original versions notwithstanding.  If there were any other additions, I missed them.  Episode VI  Visuals and audio:  Both superb.  The most complex space battle scenes ever done up to that time do not have the soft focus problems of Episode V and look absolutely wonderful.  The speeder chase through the forest is stunning and beautifully accomplished and looks great on a large screen TV.    Story and acting:  Again, the principals in the cast are at the top of their game with the story leading to a smashing finale of the entire tale.  The Ewoks were put in, I think, mainly for the kids to appreciate, but it's cute and well-done.  Changes/alterations:  The rework of the ending, celebrating the victory over the Empire, is a great improvement visually and musically over the original, which looked and sounded like a Disney kiddie picture.  Oh, yes.  I guess there was a change to the musical number in Jabba's den to update it a little.       When I got to the end of this episode and saw the credits start to roll, I unexpectedly felt a chill running up the back of my neck.  Maybe it was just the music, but I think there was something else.    I am not going to give any rating of the best and the worst of these films as we all have our own opinions on that.  A word about the \\"book\\" container.  I think it's fine, using less shelf space.  Removing the discs is easy by slightly bending the page downward thus lifting the leading edge of the disc.  Then the disc can be easily pushed out by its center hole.  The paper-based material, being much softer than the polycarbonate plastic of the discs, is unlikely ever to scratch them.  A word of warning though.  I would make it a point not leave the book lying open, especially at a page where the disc has been removed.  If a foreign particle falls into the disc storage area it could end up scratching the disc.  The repolishing devices that can be used to refurbish DVDs and CDs are not usable with BDs, the thickness of the plastic of the playing side  being much less.  If you scratch a Blu-ray to the point it mistracks, I think you're out of luck.    Amazon's pricing policy:  I think I was treated more than fairly in this regard.  I pre-ordered the set months ago.  Then Amazon reduced the price by $10 and I was given notification that my original price would be reduced accordingly.  The set arrived promptly with free shipping and in perfect condition.  A great addition to my Blu-ray collection.

B005I0DLXK|4.0|I like Rihanna and I like her singles but that's all this album really is in the end, singles. It might as well be a singles collection. She didn't write any of the songs on her album and that's always been a pet peeve of mine. It's not as if pop music is great art or anything, but this album is nevertheless disappointing. Rihanna is a talented singer and I honestly believe she is capable of much more than Loud. With the exception of a few songs, this album is fairly shallow.  The singles are all very good. Great hooks, fun music and strong vocals. Basically perfect pop songs. But what's the point in buying an album unless the rest of the tracks measure up? The album tracks are generic and forgettable. The album itself feels very careless, a bunch of random songs thrown together. The best songs that aren't singles are Complicated and Love the Way You Lie Part II. And the second one is simply another version of a single! It's disappointing to say the least. From the impressive singles, I thought the album would measure up.    So it's decent enough for a pop album, but even among pop albums there have been better. Still it's fun enough and Rihanna sounds amazing. I don't regret my purchase.
B0013LPS6Q|5.0|I feel truly sad for the pathetic souls I see in some of these reviews who think U2's career started with Achtung Baby or ZooTV or the other crap they fell into in the 90s.  I'm even still amazed that anyone can take the alarmingly self-indulgent Joshua Tree album seriously, especially if they've seen any of the videos or the movie - you know, the one where they try to portray themselves as some sort of scruffy, homeless version of the Beatles.  IMO, the band fell off the face of the planet after The Unforgettable Fire.  OK, maybe that's a bit harsh.  Everyone has to move on and change, and anything by U2 is still better music than the other mainstream sludge that has come out in the last 20 years.  However, it is the bands first three albums - BOY, OCTOBER, and WAR - that represent the real U2 to me.  Each one is a masterpiece of the era, and unmatched by anything the band has done since.  It's hard to believe that the same band is responsible for \\"Lemon\\"... ugh.<br /><br />From 1980 to 1985, U2 had a huge influence on me, both personally and as a musician, through these three albums.  I you were around in those years, you might remember how important this band was, and how powerful this music was.  I saw them from the 5th row of the Tower Theater in Philly on the Unforgettable Fire tour in the mid-80s, and even though I've been to a lot of concerts over the years, this is the only one that I can truly say was close to a religious experience.<br /><br />BOY, their first release, was a precursor of the more mature albums to come over the next couple of years, but it is a powerful work in its own right.  They were young at the time, and there is a definitely naivety to some of the songs here, but it works because while it has that unbounded teenage energy, joy, and angst that we all had at that age, it is blended with a depth that comes from growing up in a rough situation.  If you aren't old enough to remember it back then, you can't truly  understand how revolutionary this sound was, how completely new and original the Edge's guitar playing was.  This album has influenced the sound of bands everywhere for decades.  BOY pretty much changed everything.<br /><br />As far as the REMASTER goes, they actually did a pretty good job.  I had the original vinyl and still have the original CD version, and I can tell you that the original studio recording quality of this album was pretty bad and inconsistent, even by the standards of the time.  Lots of sibilance, uneven mixing, and primitive digital effects.  The remastered CD is a definite improvement in sound quality, but it is still limited by the quality of the original recording.  So, it pretty much sounds like the original, but with a bit less distortion and a bit more dynamic range.  The mix is the same, and thank God they didn't try to \\"fix\\" anything up with a lot of artificial-sounding digital editing.  It is mastered at a louder volume level, like most current CDs, but not to the ridiculous levels that most others are.  The Edge supervised the remaster, which probably helped, but don't expect miracles.  If you have the original CD and a decent stereo, I definitely think it's worth upgrading to the remaster, but it's not hugely different.  The music here speaks for itself, though, no matter which version you have.
B00188M5TM|1.0|Like other reviewers here, I was at once enthralled and disgusted by the miscarriage of justice presented in 'Changeling', a film that depicts mother Christine Collins as a martyr, the LA police as evil and manipulative, and hope a commodity in the light of terrible tragedy.<br /><br />I have 2 problems with the film, one being a large matter of details and another being a small matter or respect. To do so, I have to reference the actual case details, so I have to get into some plotpoints of the film.<br />(Anyone looking for details online can google 'Wineville Chicken-Coop Murders'. It's a well-documented case)<br /><br />*spoiler warning*<br />a collection of historical inaccuracies, in no particular order:<br /><br />1)Christine Collins was a well-to-do mother, not a working girl.<br />2)Walter Collins and the 2 Winslow brothers were proved forensically to have been murdered at the Northcott farm. Their body parts were identified.<br />3)There was no testimony ever indicating there were any escapes from the chicken coop, that Walter Collins heroically risked his life to help other boys, etc.<br />4)Gordon Northcott's mother, Sarah Louise, was convicted for the murder of Walter Collins, to which she confessed.<br />5)It was speculated there were as many of 20 children killed, but it was never proved.<br />6)Arthur Hutchins confessed to not being Walter Collins shortly after Christine Collins was sent to a mental hospital, and she was released 10 days later. He was not coerced by police, but was trying to escape his mother by getting to California.<br />7)for his conduct, Captain Jones was fined $10,800, which he never paid.<br />8)Gordon Northcott was 21 at the time of the murders, not in his 30s.<br />9)There was no dismissal of the chief of police, there was the trial of Gordon Northcott and there was a civil suit by Christine Collins against Captain Jones for damages.<br /><br />From these points it's hard to miss an intent to, for dramatic purposes(for storytelling purposes), to portray Collins as a saint, Captain Jones as misogynistic and evil, Arthur Hutchins as an accomplice to the police, and Gordon Northcott as a lone madman.<br /><br />But Northcott didn't act alone. Mrs. Northcott confessed to killing Walter Collins and spent the rest of her life in San Quentin. Here's a hard question: Was she any less of a good mother to HER son?  You see, that kind of question would complicate the film's story of Christine Collins. The intent of 'Changeling' is not to REALLY tell this story.  It's intent is to KINDOF tell it as a 'Joan of Arc Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' fable, and then wrap it up with a courtroom scene and a message of hope at the end.<br /><br />Look, I don't have a problem with stories about people who are made to suffer through no fault of their own. I do find them most engaging when they manage to inject a little warmth or a little ironic humor, which this film doesn't really manage.<br /><br />I don't have a problem with films injecting a feminist morality into their stories, either.  I think the mistreatment of women is a subject that needs to be brought up again and again, but not at the expense of truth.<br /><br />I DO have a problem with films that want to explore real cases of child abuse and murder, and then lack the conviction to be honest through and through, and raise awareness of the issues... because why in God's name would anyone want to shape a child murder case into a broadly drawn entertainment for the masses- what is the thinking?<br />It's this kindof creepy creative dishonesty in the writing that does a disservice to the real-life victims.  Walter Collins died.  The only hope in his story is that his suffering ended.<br /><br />\\"Well, it's just a movie,\\" right?<br /><br />No, it's a manipulative revision of a really horrific and well-documented true story, shaped into an Oscar-or-bust vehicle for Jolie.

B000GYI32M|5.0|I could not have been happier with the dvd season that I ordered from them. It arrived earlier than was anticipated. I would definitely order from them again!
0307266303|5.0|this book was absolutely awesome.  so many life changing insights wrapped into a can't stop reading story.  i hadn't ran more than 3 miles in a week prior to this book. i've run 25 miles in the four days since finishing the book using the new newton running shoes i bought.
B003UESJEM|5.0|This is a great movie and I would highly recommend to everyone for watching because it covers what is going on with today's economy.  The seller was fantastic on getting it out to me right away.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|Just a nice story great to watch with the whole family. Good acting the special effects were well done and did not distract from the story.
B0000A2I1B|5.0|I have had this on casette for decades and had worn out the tape so I purchased the CD.  I think this is Santana's best. The music is almost other worldly -- so relaxing and yet full of rythmn and mystery.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|This was a waste of my time. Re-hash of the same plot from the first movie, just changed up the scenery.   Very disappointing. There are probably some fans of this, but you got to admit there was nothing original about this movie in comparison to the first Hangover film.
B005IZLPMY|1.0|Captain America wasn't worth the $8.25!! Even as a fan of Super-Hero movies, this wasn't good at all. The action scenes were brief and predictable. No good fight scenes, predictable and uninteresting plot, my friend even fell asleep! The action scenes were all the same: Captain America running through Nazis and punching them in the face, then moving on to the next. THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS JUST A PROMO FOR MARVEL'S NEXT MOVIE: THE AVENGERS.
1878424114|5.0|This book has many benefits- I use it when I am feel I need a different perspective or a reminder. It is full of compassionate wisdom. I recommend it for anyone, any age. ;)
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|As with several great artists recently (Sinatra, Bennet), Ray Charles gave it his all as usual. He was not well during these takes but still evokes the deep emotion he was known for. I understand on the last take with Elton John there were tears in the control room - 'nuff said.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I can tell you that since Beladona left the band, Anthrax was never the same. I stopped listening to them. John Bush belongs in Armored Saint, and Beladona belongs in Anthrax. Glad they are back and what a future they will have if they are going to stay together. This album rocks from the beginning to the end. Buy it!!!!!!
0307474275|4.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time! I absolutely love it. Professor Langdon is the modern version of Sherlock Holmes. I normally not a big reader, but this book was so suspenseful; I just couldn't put it down.<br />The thing I love most about this book is how many questions you are left with after you have finished it. Yes, it's true, this is a fiction novel. But many of the topics and plots covered in this novel are real. I mean real in the fact that they have been shrewd in mystery for hundreds if not thousands of years. For example, the antagonist of the story is a faction of the Catholic Church known as Opus Dei. Well, Opus Dei really does exist and has quite a few conspiracy theories connected to that existence. Another example is the famous Rosslyn Chapel. Rosslyn Chapel has been engulfed with conspiracy theory for hundreds of years mainly because of it connection with the Knights Templar.<br />That's what makes this book so special. Although, Brown openly admits that the book is fictional, it draws on questions that have been asked for centuries. The simple fact of the matter is that no one for sure can prove how much is fiction and how much is reality. It's simply for every reader to decide.
0307387178|3.0|Chris McCandless Really annoyed me at first, but at the very end, there was a part that hinted he wasn't as much of a jerk to those he loved, as I thought. This book was an assignment for a class, but I would probably not pick it up for another reason. The book wasn't bad, but you have to get past Chris behaving like a 14-year-old for the majority of the book.
0385333846|3.0|Slaughterhouse 5 is a very.... interesting book. Kurt Vonnegut has a very unique and original style that comes out very vividly in this book. In this book Vonnegut has some really strong, descriptive writing. This is seen especially when he is describing things or situations that occur multiple times in the book, such as breath like \\"mustard breath and roses...\\". A weakness that I saw in this book is that it is really confusing. Vonnegut has incorporated the element of time travel into this novel and the ways in which he discusses and elaborates on the time travel of the main character frequently gets very confusing and it is metaphorically, quite easy to get lost in time in sections of this book. In order to enjoy this book you just have to know that Vonnegut is anything but a nonfiction or realistic fiction author he has his own sci-fi style that has some very unique and interesting aspects in how he describes and sees things.
0345529057|5.0|Most of the time when I come across a story like this, the books come first and the show/movie second. In this case I saw the tv series over the summer, and have been viciously consuming the books ever since. Without getting too detailed, I truly appreciate a writer that is not so in love with his characters that they cannot be maimed or killed. No on is safe!  As to the quality of the books, i see a lot of people had issues with theirs and it made me hesitant to buy, but I did so anyway as I've never had a bad book from amazon and its affiliates. I can tell the binding is simple and I can imagine the issues people have mentioned happening, but for me the books have been perfect, and I bang them around a bit traveling from home to work to school...  Cannot wait for the series to return next spring... in the meantime, this is a must-read... just not for the faint of heart.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|The app works great on my rooted DX running latest ota. It has a nice widget that is highly customizable and the interface reminds me of the Cal app on my mac.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|If you haven't watched this show yet, you need to.  Get the first season, try it out, and if you like it, prepare yourself for one of the most enthralling shows on television.  I posted a review on season 1 so there isn't much to say other than this show still continues to dazzle.
B000Y9PI9U|5.0|I didn't take much notice of Amy's music until after she died (typical) eh?  I bought this album to acquaint myself with her best music. It's a very good cross-section of her style and very listenable...I'll enjoy it for ever!
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|I found this to be an intelligently and eloquently written book which had an rawness and honesty about it. In the book, Portia de Rossi gives detailed accounts of her eating disorder and how, in a desire to become thin, got into a dysfunctional eating pattern of dieting, binging, purging and obsessional exercising. She writes from the perspective of when she was suffering with the disorder and this is what I found to be quite eye-opening because it lets you in to the eating-disordered mind. The book has a wonderful ending (don't worry, no spoilers) and tells of how gradually she overcame her disorder. As a therapist, I have recommended this book to those who are recovering or have recovered from an eating disorder and many say it has helped them.  Although I have never had an eating disorder myself, I have struggled with losing weight just like many women and dieted on and off for years, unsuccessfully. After reading this book, I realised that dieting in itself can be a disordered eating pattern. As soon as I finished reading the last page, I quit dieting and quit the gym. You'll understand why when you read the book.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|This disc was exceptional, including a CD and a DVD, so that the music is grounded in the Playing of Change project and experience. The music is beautiful. I have been listening to it over and over.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|After reading many reviews and seeing this blu-ray on sale, I decided to see what all the hype is about.  The show simply captured me from the first episode and I haven't been able to get enough.  My wife and I both are just engrossed with this show and can't wait for each new episode.  Breaking Bad is definitely one of the best shows on television and if it keeps the current pace, could go down as one of the best dramas of all time.  One a side note, if you do not like the first season, you most likely won't like the following seasons so if you are thinking about purchasing the seasons, start off by buying season 1 only and then go from there.
B005COO1X6|4.0|This in my opinion is a .99 cent read, not really a $2.99 single.  Either way, I bought it and enjoyed a classic \\"car\\" King story.  The story is more or less about people trying to do good things for others...and what price they pay for their good deeds.  I thought the 6 year old girl was a bit old for her age, but loved the addition of children in the story...adds a bit of spook to it!  I wasn't expecting the book to be finished at \\"80%\\" on my Kindle, I was a little disappointed that the story ended and I was given a 20% peak into the next book by King.  I didn't even read the 20% intro into his next book-could have lived without it...it made me feel as though I was buying a trailer/excerpt.  I would have liked a heads up on this!
0812550706|5.0|Title: Ender's Game  Author: Orson Scott Card  Genre: YA Science Fiction  Publishing Information: 324 pages; January 1st, 1985 by Tor Science Fiction  Series: Ender's Saga #1  Where I got it: Border's liquidation sale  One sentence: When child genius six-year-old Ender Wiggin is recruited by the government as defense for a hostile alien race's next attack, his life changes forever in ways he could never imagine.  Themes: Space, battle, war, kids, aliens, saving the world,   Main character: 4/5  Ender was a fascinating, well-rounded character. He consistently felt older to me than his age, but because it had been thoroughly explained earlier in the novel, it was nothing that significantly turned me off. I particularly enjoyed Ender's struggle with his situation and his emotions and actions seemed reasonable and realistic. Ender is one of those characters who continue to be sympathetic, despite the fact that he is undoubtedly supposed to be a character whose smarts and abilities place him in a different league than most children.  Secondary characters: 4/5  I especially loved the secondary characters because they were almost more human than Ender was. Petra was cute and bad-ass at the same time, Alai was sweet and I loved how he befriended Ender, and I adored Bean, who was spunky and an absolute riot. The struggles that Ender had making friends made those relationships even more fantastic and heart-warming.   Writing style: 4/5  Card's writing style was built for a movie remake- the action scenes are intense and heart-stopping, the sentences short and quick to the point. I was slightly disappointed by the choppy sentences and the slightly juvenile style, but it seemed to move along well and I was rarely jolted out of the book.   Plot: 5/5  Absolutely fantastic! I was a little nervous about the premise, but Card executed it brilliantly. I absolutely adored the battle tactics and politics in the system, which was complex and entertaining- exactly the sort of thing I love to read. Further, there are such deeper questions brought up by the ending that challenged my opinions and thoughts on the entire novel.   Ending: 4.5/5  What a shocker. Honestly, the climax was so fantastic and shocking, but the final ending was something on its own. It brought up so many more questions and discussions that just brought a further level to the novel.   Best scene: The climactic scene was just phenomenal- wow.  Positives: Strong, compelling characters, fantastic plot, ending!!!!  Negatives: A few weak characterizations, sometimes the writing was childish.  First Line: I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and I tell you he's the one.  Cover: A little retro- I wanted something a little more modern and mysterious.   Verdict: So good! I really don't know what else to say. Even if you don't like science-fiction, definitely try this novel out.  Rating: 8.6 / 10
B005974CNA|4.0|I am not a huge Dream Theater fan. I find that individually the musicians are very good but together it's never quite as good as it should be and on previous albums the vocals have been a bit weak.  However! I think they got it right on this album. Perhaps it is due to Portnoi leaving but they seem to have combined all the ingridients just right. Some really great songs - although I must say that the keyboards can get a bit much a times.
0553801473|4.0|Prior to reading the book, I read several negative reviews here, so I my expectations for this long-awaited fifth installment were lowered. After finishing ADWD, I'm a little surprised by the number of negative reviews. Yes, the book had some obvious flaws and no satisfying conclusion, but overall I found this to be a thrilling page-turner that moved the plot forward and sets the stage for an epic conclusion in the final two volumes. What that conclusion will be, I have absolutely no idea.<br /><br />First, the flaws:<br />- some story lines dropped out half-way through the book with no further mention of them. I understand this is not the concluding volume, so I did not expect resolution, but I do not understand how this particular volume could be completed and published without at least further reference to the stories. I specifically refer to the story lines of Jaime and Davos.<br /><br />- The impending war in the north for Winterfell was particularly unsatisfying. I can only hope this is satisfactorily resolved in the next volume, but the buildup toward the confrontation was possibly the strongest part of the book, and the \\"ending\\" was far too cryptic for my liking. Readers (myself included) love this series for the complex characters, political intrigue, and (perhaps most of all) the battles. I wanted to see a pitched battle with many Freys and Boltons getting their heads bashed in, but Martin left me hanging.<br /><br />-some of the story lines could have been trimmed or omitted entirely. The Quentyn Martell chapters presented a nice, stand-alone story, but I do not see how they moved the plot forward. Dorne and house Martell have become firmly established as players in the game, and this particular adventure of Quentyn and his friends did nothing to thicken the plot. Also, Danaery's predicament in Mereen was overdone with too many characters that I did not really care about in a part of the world that has little to do with the story in Westeros. I think Danaery's storyline in Mereen could have been cut in half while still providing more action and plot movement. I think Martin wrote himself into a corner here, and this was the main reason the book was so long overdue.<br /><br />Now, the positives:<br />- Excellent character development with the main characters. Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Danaerys each had major transformations following \\"A Storm of Swords\\": Jon as lord commander of the wall, Tyrion as kinslayer and exile, and Dany as queen and ruler of a conquered city. Each has had to adapt to their new roles, and the depiction of their doubts and inner steel is what makes us love these characters.<br /><br />-Excellent plot development. Contrary to what many have written, I think the plot moved forward tremendously in this fifth volume. I do not want to present any spoilers here, so all I will say is that by the end of the book, I have a clear sense of the various story lines coalescing now into a final struggle for a united people and then the final battle against the Others. It is always darkest before the dawn, and by the end of the book, winter has truly arrived.<br /><br />-Excellent plot twists. I think many readers will find these twists frustrating, especially since everyone has had so long to theorize on their own beliefs on how the story will turn out. However, this is what sets Martin apart from the others - his story is unpredictable and does not follow the classic fantasy norms. The story is both epic and personal.<br /><br />Despite the flaws in this volume, Martin is still head and shoulders above most every other fantasy writer out there. I eagerly await the next volume, but I won't hold my breath. I am optimistic the next volume will be out in under three years.
0393330435|5.0|I only read half book but its great! Very interesting and fun. Must have if you are an Apple Fan.
0393064476|5.0|A nice, well-written, thought-provoking book by a respected scholar, Stephen Greenblatt.  An obscure Papal scribe, a long lost Roman poem, and a master theoretician on life (Epicurus), are seamlessly brought together in this description of how it was possible for many to move beyond blind religious faith to an alternative explanation of the human condition and afterlife. As a bonus, a reader learns much about ancient books and libraries.  Readers of this book may also enjoy, as I did, \\"How to Live: A Life of Montaigne\\" by Sarah Bakewell (2010).
B003YL4LYI|1.0|compared to the first 3 this is a total waste of trees<br /><br />characters and plot go absolutely no where. its like reading a commercial break
1933952806|5.0|\\"Mastering\\" this word in the title is very  appropriate. With this book the user has a real guide to use the D7000 and the book is easy to read even for a non-native english language person
B00005JLH3|3.0|Coming from someone who spent their college years in a southern, mostly black, marching band on the drum line I can say that this movie is atleast accurate enough to come across well. This movie isn't a documentary, it's Hollywood, hence the exaggerations on some aspects of the story. Also the movie focuses mostly on the drummers themselves while the rest of the band kind of takes a back seat. While being in a band like this does require serious commitment and hard work to pull these types of field shows off, it's not exactly as \\"boot camp\\" like as the movie tries to portray. Although i'm just speaking from personal experience with my school. Also, it may be difficult for someone who is more used to the corps style of marching to understand what's going on with band like this, but just open yourself up to learn something new and you may enjoy it. As for the movie itself, it's nothing to write home about. The best reason to watch this movie is just to see the performances of some of these bands. The only thing that I wish this movie had was a bit more focus outside of the drumlines. Although it's the name of the movie, still there's more to these bands than their drummers.
0307946711|2.0|I admit I only came to know about One Day or the author for that matter only after coming across the movie trailer for One Day. Soon after, I ordered it online and while waiting for it to arrive, I decided to explore Nicholls' other works. And I loved Starter for Ten! It was funny and entertaining. So I had high hopes for One Day. But only to be miserably disappointed! I'm halfway through the book and I'm trying my best to finish it as it's not in my nature to leave things incomplete. The book is fighting a losing battle in trying to hold my interest. Like others have stated, Dexter is not a character worth writing a book on, neither is Emma. Skipping a year or 2 every chapter makes it even less appealing for me as I don't see anything significant happening. The words are sometimes quite very dull that I get gripped by this sudden urge to hurl the book away and never read it again (:P) I'm not usually hard to please as a reader but if this book isn't doing it for me, then something must be very wrong with it. Reviews all over the web are totally misleading. I read such rave reviews. Maybe thats what failed. Expecting too much.  Almost more than halfway through it and I have yet to find a single likeable trait in Dexter. Emma is just plain boring who keeps making self deprecating remarks and honestly, it gets old after a while.  Had I borrowed this book from a library, I would have returned it without completing it (as rare as I do that) but since I paid a good $15, I will try and finish it. And I'm secretly hoping theres even a small amount of satisfaction in me after I do complete it.  Borrow it from a friend first, if you're not sure you'll like it. Wouldn't recommend buying it just based on the misleading reviews it has gotten.
0066620996|5.0|Excellent Book, the only thing is that I ordered 22 and I only received 21, no reason and no explanation for not receiving the book.
0060899220|5.0|This is really quite an impressive read. Not only did I learn a lot about a man I feel exemplifies cool, but I also learned a ton about the industry he works in. The fact that he mixes the information about his business with his own biography seemed not only effortless but also natural considering he essentially IS his career. I'd highly recommend this book to anybody who likes biographies, cooking or is involved in the restaurant industry.
B001UV4XWY|4.0|Not too much to say. This was based on Richard Matheson's Short Story \\"Button, Button\\". The short story was also adapted to the 1980s \\"Twilight Zone\\" short episode starring Mare Winningham of the same name: \\"Button, Button\\"  The movie's late 1960s setting hearkens to the largest representation of Matheson's work on the screen, Rod Serling's \\"Twilight Zone\\". Cameron Diaz's, James Marsden's acting are fine. Worth a watch. Frank Langella as the tenebrous antagonist, on the other hand, delivers a great performance. The special effects aren't terribly shocking, but they aren't too overdone either. This isn't Batman after all.  The movie isn't a horror movie. It is science fiction...kinda. It lacks a clear pigeonhole to fit into. The events surrounding the story are not true, not based on science, so I guess it could be classified as fantasy. The movie manages to exude a creepy aura that gives you a \\"clanging\\" kind of scary movie. Something like \\"1408\\", but less dramatic.   So, this movie isn't the height of science fiction or movies in general.   I would say, however watch it once. Its well done. Given what I know now, after watching it, I don't want those two hours of my life back.   Good Movie. 8.2/10

B000022TSW|5.0|It's been twelve years since this movie came out and before rewatching it recently I didn't expect it to be quite as good as I remembered. I was wrong. \\"South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut\\" is as good today as when it was first released. The satire is spot-on and the songs are both hilarious and well composed (\\"Blame Canada\\" was nominated for an Oscar).   This movie is South Park at its very best -- perhaps even perfection. It's one of the funniest movies ever made. If you haven't seen this movie yet - don't wait any longer. If you've already seen it, watch it again! I've already watched it once more since rediscovering it a few weeks ago. It's a movie you can watch over and over again.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Ever since i purchased a blu ray player, i've anticipated this star wars release.  i love the films and have viewed or purchased every vhs and dvd release.  i always thought this complete set blu ray release would be the be all end all release that would allow me to finally purge my video center of my star wars collection.  this release lived up to my hope...almost.  When revenge of the sith first opened in theaters i was fortunate enough to see it in IMAX.  i was completely blown away by the film.  not just the story, but the visual presentation as well.  the star wars universe came alive on that screen.  i purchased the DVD the first day it came out, put it in the dvd player, sat back and was thoroughly disappointed by what i saw.  it wasn't the same film.  when watching the blu ray version, i saw the same film i saw in the imax theater.  just an absolutely amazing film!  the biggest surprise, however, was watching Attack of the Clones, a movie heavily criticized for its presentation when it was released in theaters.  Attack of the Clones has always been one of my favorite movies, but i understood the criticism.  the actors always looked like props in a digital world.  well, with the blu ray release, that criticism is no longer valid.  the blu ray format successfully integrates all aspects of the film into a beautiful, cohesive presentation.  the end result is a much better film.  i felt as if i was watching episode 2 for the first time.  the film is so crisp and clearly presented that you could spend the entire film only paying attention to the background and still have a very enjoyable experience.  the scene that best articulates this is the scene when anakin and obi wan walk into the sports bar.  you can clearly see every character and what they are doing.    with the release of the original trilogy, george lucas proved he was ahead of his time.  with the release of the blu ray set, lucas proves he was once again ahead of his time with episodes 1-3.  the vhs and dvd releases were not adequate formats for the vast star wars universe on display in episodes 1-3.  it took the blu ray format to make lucas's vision really come through.  as for episodes 4-6, the blu ray release is a disappointment.  while the format finally brings together all aspects of episodes 1-3, it has the opposite effect for episodes 4-6.  yes, the picture quality is better...but that's the problem.  for starters, the added scenes from the special edition release look really out of place against the background of the entire scene.  and there are many scenes where the picture quality is so clear, it's completely obvious you are looking at a model against a space backdrop.  of the three films, Return of the Jedi transfers to blu ray the best.  but the scene where luke and leia are on speeders on the endor moon looks so fake it's comical.  you can tell they are stationary against a moving picture behind them.  a new hope transfers the worst to blu ray.  the magic of the star wars films has always been that they look real.  with episodes 4-6, most of the scenes look fake on blu ray.  but this is true for other films as well.  blu ray is a wonderful new format and some older films can transfer to this format and look better, while some transfer and look worse.  surprisingly for me, the original star wars films look worse.    with this release, lucas, i hope, has finally finished releasing the star wars movies.  for me, the definitive star wars collection consists of the following six discs:  episodes 1-3 on blu ray and episodes 4-6 on dvd.  give me these six discs and i am forever a happy person!
0385534639|4.0|here's the thing.  this book was lovely and captivating. mind you, it hasn't secured a place in my heart like harry potter, wuthering heights, or the woman in white has.    but it's one of those book. ya know, the ones where you can read it quickly and straight through and be lost while reading it.  maybe it didn't change my life, but it was absolutely enjoyable.  i'd undoubtedly recommend it. because one of the best parts of reading a book is losing yourself happily within a story.
0061537969|5.0|This book is one that dog lovers and average readers alike can love and derive inspiration from, both at the level of a good story and also spiritual growth.  It's told in first-person, the narrator being a dog who belongs to a guy who is a part-time professional race car driver. It is essentially an autobiography, an easy read that will make you think, cry, and laugh.  For a \\"dog-person\\" like me, I found it uncanny how the author was able to speak a dog's mind;  there are no sentimental bits of anthropomorphizing here, these are the \\"words\\" of a dog that I find extremely believable.  I \\"see\\" these thoughts and ways of thinking in dogs all the time.  There are many \\"Yes!\\" moments in the narrative that all of us can relate to in our own lives with our dogs; readers who know nothing about dogs will gain a new perspective, and the blending of dog and human life with the sport of car racing is seamless and easy to appreciate, even for those who know nothing about auto sports.  The elements of philosophy and life-attitude that are inserted in the story line are really wonderful, so good that I actually noted passages that I wanted to keep for future reference.  For instance, we have been told that \\"the mood of the handler runs down the leash to the dog\\" and that dogs are very sensitive to changes in humans and dogs alike, changes that we may not notice which produce unexpected reactions in our dogs at classes, competitions, and in other stressful situations.  This is perfectly exemplified in one of the book's passages where the protagonist speaks about being able to sense involuntary chemical reactions in humans;  tension, fear, anxiety and the like.  Dogs can smell and taste these chemicals, such as adrenaline, in ways that humans cannot.  This book will give you a new appreciation of the personalities and sensibilities of dogs plus thoughts to ponder and live by, and I give it five out of five stars.

B004EPZ08E|3.0|The premise of the movie had the potential to produce one of the funniest and most relatable comedies of all time-- and somehow it didn't. It seemed to promise the same kind of that's-so-my-boss! exclamations that Office Space did, but none of the villains in Horrible Bosses seem real except maybe Farrell's greedy drug-addict character. Spacey and Aniston are basically cartoons in this movie, and although that makes for a few chuckles here and there, their characters just don't feel analogous to any horrible boss that anyone in the audience is likely to have worked for. So the movie operates in an old fashioned slap-stick manner, which feels unpleasantly dated in my opinion.    Of the three protagonists, Jason Bateman is the only I thought was really funny, but he's always good for a laugh.  I don't care for Sudeikis at all and that other fellow just seemed like he was in Jerry Lewis mode the whole movie.   But here's the brief:  This is not a classic comedy by any means, and I don't think anyone can truly relate to most of it's content, but it's worth watching for a descent amount of laughs and chuckles, especially if you're having a movie night with the gang.    -TDW

B000PMLFRA|3.0|I already knew what I was getting into when I bought this blu-ray version.  Yes, I would prefer the original theatrical releases but unfortunately they aren't available.  All of the new editions as well as the awful episodes 1,2, and 3 have soured me quite a bit on this once great franchise. If I didn't have children I probably wouldn't have been interested at all.  As a matter of fact I would of probably waited for the final release of these films on blu-ray.  It is sad Lucas doesn't have more respect for his fans and the original versions of these films.   Anyway, Star Wars hasn't looked this good in a home theater before.  The biggest problem with this release is that there aren't any special features!  They could have easily ported the standard editions over to this set. I know this whole setup is premeditated to make the fans spend as much cash as possible but come on!!!

B004EPZ07U|3.0|This was obviously DC's attempt to try and realize one of its lesser known characters, the way Marvel did so well with Iron Man (and Thor, and Captain America...) To be fair, the movie is not a colossal failure.  It has some wit, the script is actually pretty serviceable, the action is fairly good, but somehow the movie just doesn't feel like a success-- it feels like a rental.  Though there are many superhero movies that hope to be even as passably nifty as Green Lantern (Jonah Hex, Daredevil, Ghost Rider, anyone?), passable niftiness is not the standard that was set by Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, and it was not set by Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, and so on.    The movie seems too short. The Green Lantern story line is vast and populous, yet this movie feels oddly compact and undermanned.  It doesn't have enough room to breath, and worst of all, its villain is acutely underwhelming, as if his inclusion in the movie was just an afterthought when the writers realized that they hadn't chosen a villain yet by the time they completed the script.   It's a good thing DC has a sure hit with The Dark Knight Rises.   -TDW

1563899426|4.0|The story of Fables, as one might guess, involves many of the characters from fairytales and fables and pools them into one, modern-day tale set in New York. The characters have been driven from their homeland by the Adversary and now reside in New York under a strict law that they remain secretive and hide their true identities and act as functioning members of normal society. So, the story begins with Bigby (The Big, Bad Wolf) and Snow White trying to solve a very personal murder case involving White's sister, Rose Red. She had apparently been murdered in her apartment and now it's up to Detective Bigby and Snow White to figure out whodunit and more importantly, why!<br /><br />This is an interesting comic series and at first glance, doesn't seem like it would work very well. However, you couldn't be more wrong. It's a really good read and keeps the pages turning! The inclusion of all the fairytale characters as humans is really neat (aside from the Three Little Pigs who remain pigs) and seeing Little Boy Blue and Jack and the Beanstalk and all the other characters was really neat. The whole crime drama feel of this first story arc was interesting and the artwork and writing drove the story along nicely. Overall, this collection of the first five issues of the Fables series is a wonderful start and there's even a short story about Bigby in the back as well as a bonus! If this sounds interesting at all, I recommend picking it up!

0307454541|4.0|(NO MAJOR SPOILERS HERE) - Seeing the first teaser for the Daniel Craig/Rooney Mara film I picked up the book expecting a high-octane action thriller. Turns out, surprisingly little to no octane but rather a psychological mystery well worth the ride if you stick to it.<br /><br />Part of that is owed to the writing style. You get to know the characters, especially Salander, not as much by peering into what is going on in their heads, but more through their actions. Being Asperger's myself, as Salander is suspected to be, it's definitely a unique way to get into the mind and character of an Aspie. When something bothers us we don't always react the same way most people do. So we get less of the traditional \\"X really bothered Salander (emotion, emotion, swirling emotions)\\" and instead we get more of \\"Salander frowned and (action/what she does about it).\\" It's the buildup of those actions and reactions from which a picture of this person gradually forms.<br /><br />The other reason for so much exposition is that it is a very character-driven mystery. When the aforementioned writing style does lead us into a high-octane sequence, one might almost miss it. We expect to see lots of capital letters and exclamation points and description of high emotion. Instead, the action sequences read almost like a matter-of-fact police report, describing coldly and simply what is going on. The \\"octane\\" therefore comes from what you know of the characters. \\"Whoa! That was kind of out of character for this person!\\" Subsequently, as the core mystery starts to unfold, what makes X creepy or Y something mysterious that you suddenly crave to know more about is what you know of the characters and personalities involved. It's knowing how the dysfunctional Vanger family disfunctions which gives the mystery its dimension.<br /><br />So we end up getting sucked into the mystery much the way the character of Blomkvist does: low expectations based on the dry start, but inexplicably, as details start to unceremoniously emerge, they light a spark that has us hungry to know more. If you require fast-action to hold your attention, this is not the book for you. If you want to stretch your brain a bit, get the action and emotion not from what is written on the page but from what you now know of the personalities involved, this book will not disappoint.they light a spark that has us hungry to know more.

0553801473|2.0|Considering that I spent the entire summer reading the entire series, and yes, I was hooked and pulled in, but what the???? I just finished book five and I am seriously disappointed. I get it, yes, many of our beloved characters die, but for those that survived, what's to come of them? Will Dany make her way to King's Landing and take the throne? What will come of Bran? And what happened to Osha and Ricken? And the amazing Tyrion and Jaime. All of the living characters are spread across the many leagues and just left hanging. I have never in my 45 years of reading, ever had this experience--it's as if I was mid-way through a great story, and it abruptly ended. Mr. Martin, if you are a decent, honorable writer, you will give us book six and please, I beg you, take your time. It will be worth the wait to see what is to come of all of these characters.
B005LAZIRY|5.0|Most fans should understand by now that Opeth don't rest on their laurels.  Given that their lineup is substantially different from that of Ghost Reveries and earlier, it's no surprise to hear them follow Mikael's muse into a gorgeous journey and masterful bow to those who helped define him as an artist.  Heritage calls to mind King Crimson, Deep Purple (Slither would've fit nicely on Burn), and other defining artists of progressive and hard rock, with elements of fusion, jazz, and folk to keep it challenging as it is satisfying.  Mikael's vision also creates a textured whole that breathes fully in spacious atmosphere, necessary for Opeth's infamous patience when it comes to arriving at their destination.  As always, Opeth deliver.  Heritage is beautifully crafted, it respectfully acknowledges its predecessors, and, in all ways that matter, is still very much Opeth.  This one may end up being nothing more than a detour, such is Mikael's obsequious devotion to unexplored frontiers, but Heritage is clearly destined to become a classic.
B004EPZ09S|3.0|This movie really gets you to thinking about what could happen, and if you look back at recent outbreaks I think we have come pretty close, but the government won't share that with us.<br />The acting was very good in this movie, very interesting information came out and I like how they eventually went back to the beginning so you could see how it all started. The actors did a good job with the material they had. However, if you are looking for some sort of thriller like a Michael Palmer book don't go see this movie, it's more thought provcating than thiller.  Now if you will excuse me, I have the urge to go wash my hands!! Lol

B004Y1USJE|3.0|I gave this one listen while preoccupied with something else; a good test of my will to listen.  Nothing grabbed me.  Nothing.  Been a fan since, what, '72?  What would a fan like me think if a fave group picked up a soundalike singer?  Said singer ISN'T Jon Anderson.  Jon has a great dramatic singing talent; I didn't hear that here.  In fact the whole affair seems lackluster, like they know it's all  a lie and aren't putting in much effort.  The only figure who seems capable of   giving this any juice is Steve, but most of what he's laid down seems on autopilot.  Without Rick to trade riffs off of (or compete with)..., well, you get the drift.  The only Yes album  I don't have is \\"Drama\\", so the folks who say some fans can't deal with changes in the lineup can't say I won't.  Heck, Drama is better than this.  I did enjoy the last tune, and David did a pretty good job of it; but I couldn't help think, while listening to that, that Jon would have made it a classic.  My review should read; 2 and a half stars.  I borrowed it from my library, and I'm glad I could preview it without buying.  I wish the current guys luck, and hope the real Yes isn't history.  The five guys who embody the Yes sound, with whome the absense of more than one makes this a tribute band at best.  You don't need to \\"Fly from it\\", but don't expect a lot of drama...

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I got interested in the reviews of this moview when I found many very low.  Most of these find it light or boring, a waste of superstar talent, etc.  Now, I'm not going to go through all the hundreds of negative reviews here and on IMDB, but the ones I have read I think are missing a critical point.  The chief characters in this film are living in a world where the people they are dealing with are corrupt up to their shifty eyeballs. Count the number of people on the take.  Or, take, the surveillance crew who zoom in on Elise to see if she is wearing underwear.  Or, notice the \\"bad guy\\" is a globe-trotting serial killer for the heck of it and no one seems to care much.  Or the fact that the police of Europe are all over trying to find the missing guy who stole (?) billions from the serial killer only so that the government can get its cut(taxes).  My take on this:  Here are two very intelligent people in the midst of this mess who are in love but have strong reasons to distrust each other (why not...nearly everyone else is betraying something or someone).  How can they regain each other's trust?  I happened to like the movie a lot because it had romantic music, showed colorful shots of Venice, had the two stars doing very well exactly what stars do in movies.  I like it even more now that I've realized that it does actually make a point.  It reminds me a lot of Casablanca, except in that film everyone has the integrity to hate the serial killers; but The Tourist has a better ending.  Note --  The missing person has not given word on his whereabouts to Elise for two years.  What is the first thing he says to her?
B004LROMSO|4.0|Reviewing TV shows is kind of pointless - if you're looking for it, you're almost certainly a fan already, but in case you jumped here via a link from a similar show, here are thoughts from a new viewer:  I was asked to review this program having no prior experience with it at all. Granted, I did not expect much. Yea, another cheesy period piece with Hollywood pretty boys pretending to be tough and dramatic. HOWEVER - after the first 4 episodes, I find myself eagerly awaiting the rest!  They twist the popular telling of King Arthur in new and interesting ways. The production values are very high, the sets are lush, the lighting well done, and the matte painting special effects and cinematography are far above average. The location shooting in Ireland and Canada is a treat. The writing and acting are certainly decent, and the cast, while mostly filled with Hollywood pretty boys/girls is well cast and does a good job.   I love the understated way Merlin is portrayed by Joseph Fiennes - until the fourth episode you still can't decide whether he has any wizardry powers at all. The Arthur character is and noble at heart, but impetuous and young. He is well played, but somehow remains the least interesting of the main characters for me. His nemesis, half-sister Morgan (Eve Green), practices witchcraft and borders on over-the-top dramatics in her attempt to capture the throne, but she reigns it in just enough to make her character fascinating and very hard to take your eyes off. (There may be some actual wizardry here - you may remember Eva as the Bond girl in Casino Royale - yet here, she looks younger and sexier than she did several years ago in that film.)  For an \\"action themed\\" story, it runs at a slower pace than some of its rivals, but I feel this works well for them. While there is some nudity and profanity, it is mild compared to the graphic violence-porn of things like Spartacus. Camelot, so far, would be a PG-13 to Spartacus's strong-R or NC-17 - allowing Camelot to pay more attention to characters and story. It is clearly trying to appeal to the male and female demographic. Except for the occasional nude scene (not graphic, but not mild either) it could be shared with the teens as well, but they might be a bit uncomfortable if the parents are around!  I'm a little concerned as to how this story will keep its momentum. About half of the classic Arthurian legend is covered in the first 4 episodes, so they're going to have to be creative to keep up the quality exhibited so far, but I'm hoping that they succeed, as I would strongly recommend Camelot based on the first 4 episodes.
1439102937|2.0|Maybe I expected too much from the author of The Devil wears Prada, but Chasing Harry Winston made my reading bored. The chapters are really not so connected and the author often cut the story and after go back. The book seems to be with no real starting and ending story but just some not-followed telling. And the characters are bored, except  Adriana.  And what I didn´t like too was too much of unnecessarily dirty words.

It is unlike \\"ANYTHING\\" I have ever heard before in my life! I heard \\"pumped up kicks\\" a few times on the radio and thought it was pretty catchy. So much so that I downloaded the album. To my surprise, I am in a trance listening to every track. Almost as if it takes me to another planet or something. This album is worth the investment. Foster the people, keep up the good work!
B002Q7JYPC|2.0|This double album would have been a lot better if The Eagles had selected the 10 strongest songs and released it as a single disc; there just simply aren't enough good songs on here to justify a double album.  The CD starts off very strong, with \\"No More Walks In The Woods,\\" \\"How Long,\\" and \\"Busy Being Fabulous,\\" sounding like The Eagles of old.  Unfortunately, it spirals downward very quickly after that.  Although dark and depressing, Don Henley's \\"Waiting In The Weeds\\" is a thing of rare beauty, but there really isn't much else on here worth noting.  The second disc is just insufferably bad.  Download the few good songs and don't waste your resources on the rest of it.  This is far and away the worst thing the Eagles have recorded.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|What I can't understand is actually the fuss surrounding this film.  People aren't just confused by it, they're acting offended by it.  Apparently audiences in a lot of showings were yelling at the screen and snapping at people who tried to shush them.  This movie was unusual, but I don't get what caused people to be so actively offended by it when they can sit through most movies, ambitious or otherwise, without any real problem.  Is it the norm in our culture now to react to unexpected or strange images on the screen by getting angry and yelling?  Could I just go out on a limb and say that if you leave before a film's over or spend the entire time yelling at the screen, I have no respect for your opinion of the film?  Chimps parading as people aside, I at least enjoyed the movie.  I saw it late in its run so I never had to worry about an audience yelling at the screen.  I'm the kind of person who's patient.  If a movie confuses me I don't flip out or start yelling and ranting; I sit it out.  So that's what I did with this movie.  I tried my best to see what Malick was doing, because I think it's pretty obvious that such a respected filmmaker would have seen at least some reason for making this movie.  First of all, there's one major reason why this film isn't for everyone and it's not one I've heard anyone else mention:  The film, from top to bottom, is extremely musical.  I mean that in many ways, but let me be clearer:  The father in the family the story focuses on wanted to be a conductor and dropped off that career path in favor of a secure job.  The soundtrack is all very carefully-chosen classical music.  And if you zoom out far enough, the overall structure of the film is actually a very musical one - you could almost see it as some insane variant on sonata form.  It's hard to describe, but visual themes resurface at various times in the film in ways that feel very similar to recapitulations in music.  As I said; not for everyone.  I picked up on this stuff, but I'm a musician.  I loved it.  As far as the images of dinosaurs and the cosmos interspersed in it, my impression was that Malick was trying to show cycles of creation, longing and destruction in frameworks other than those of humans.  As I saw it - and this is up for debate - I read the movie as showing a very eastern sort of philosophy; one that involves a sort of reincarnation or continuation beyond the lives and deaths of individuals, species, or even planets.  Call that pretentious if you want, I thought it was done very nicely, though, and I'm very decidedly buying it as soon as it's out on DVD.  Also, I don't get why people bothered yelling at the scenes of the cosmos.  If you didn't get it, I still think it was some of the most beautiful visuals I've seen in a film in a really long time.  Relax.  It's pretty.
B0057O6IDW|1.0|I never understood the hype around Fulci. He's severely overrated. This movie is one of them. Slow, terribly acted, terrible directed, and just plain stupid. This is not a great movie, even from the 80's. Even beyond the \\"cheesy\\" classic. Definitely a movie worth forgetting. Watch Zombie 2 instead.
193413712X|5.0|I have one piece of advice for you if you're thinking about buying this book:  If you plan on reading it in half-hour-a-day increments, don't.  You will lose track of it completely.  I couldn't tell you if Harding intended it this way when he wrote it, but in order to really have a positive experience with this book, you need to take a Saturday, sit down after breakfast, and read the whole thing cover to cover.  Most of the negative reviews here seem to say they read it slowly and ended up unable to comprehend it.  That's because the book is dense, nonlinear and jumps from point to point very rapidly.  If you read it in one shot it'll all stick in your short-term memory.  If you can swing that, it's quite an experience, because you will find it absolutely has a structure, a story and a reason for existing.  If you don't have the time to approach it that way, though, then I recommend you don't bother.  This isn't the kind of book you can pick at over time.  That being said, I'll also add that this is now one of my absolute favorite books.  I thought the narrative was quite coherent, honestly, and I didn't have any trouble connecting the dots.  I hope you have the same experience!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I picked this bag up for my fiance who needed a bigger bag for all of her camera accessories.  First off the bag seems very well made. The zippers don't feel cheap. The back of the bag features a good amount of padding so that it is soft against your back. The shoulder straps are also well padded, they feel good on my shoulders even after a long day of carrying it around Disneyland with my fiance.   The important part is of course the inside of the bag. The compartments are able to be moved around and velcro in place, quite securely actually. The bag is very large, with room for a lot of different DSLR parts. My bag fits my fiance's D3100, 18-55mm lens, 55-200mm lens, SB-600 flash, tulip hood and wide angle lens with no problem at all. There are also a couple different compartments for holding books, or backdrops or whatever you can fit in there. Also straps for a tripod on the side, which I think is nice.  Overall, you can tell we are very happy with this bag. We've had it about a week and can't believe we used to use an older the shoulder bag before. Great price and great quality.

I've been struggling with losing weight, and just following this diet, I lost half the weight that I've been trying to lose, and the best part is that it was easy and quick! I would recommend this book to anyone who has been struggling with their weightloss journey. The book is an easy read, and has great recipes to help you!

B0007PAMR4|3.0|This review is based on the Extended Edition of the film Dune, originally directed by David Lynch.<br /><br />Most professional reviewers panned this film unmercifully, and I shared that thought when I saw the original back in 1984. In many ways, it seemed like a colossal waste of talent, not least of which was the director / screenwriter Lynch, who, according to Wikipedia, refuses to even talk about this film.<br /><br />The Extended Edition does not even credit Lynch as director, and almost all the added material is background done by voiceover for second rate \\"Heavy Metal\\" style illustrations, which seems a shame because apparently Lynch's original raw footage had about 6 hours of film. So why am I doing a review of a bad new edition of what was considered a bad movie.<br /><br />First, because the story of the movie and novel on which it's based, succeed where I think that altogether better film Avatar fails. Dune is the victory of a fresh, uncorrupt, messianic point of view over a society driven purely by Machiavellian principles of power politics. Like Avatar, at the center of the conflict is a seemingly magical substance, the spice of Arrakis. This premise is even more engaging than the blockbuster Good versus Evil stories behind LOTR and Star Wars. But George Lucas, Peter Jackson, and James Cameron had complete artistic control of their works, and they really knew how to direct special effects and action. Compared to the ground-breaking special effects of the first Star Wars in 1977, Dune's 1984 effects in space are an embarrassment. The only \\"effects\\" which worked in Dune were those in the open desert, and that was because it was filmed in a real desert, in Mexico.<br />There is another aspect of Lynch's Dune which deserves praise. That is the rather imaginative set decoration which is an imaginative mix of Art Deco, H. R. Geiger influences from Alien (1979), Steam Punk, and \\"Heavy Metal\\" tech. This praise only extends to the interiors and to the design of some of the buildings.<br /><br />A third modestly praiseworthy element is the huge cast of familiar faces. With such a large cast of characters, each with a highly unusual function, totally outside our normal experience, it was imperative that we would be able to instantly recognize the characters from familiar faces. Consider, for example, Star Wars IV, where the only really new character was the Jedi knight, who could be easily \\"mapped\\" onto our notion of the medieval Knight Templar. In LOTR, the only real stretch was the ents and Sauron himself. Dune has at least four unique new character types, plus the notion of the sand worms. Unfortunately, this also meant there was a colossal waste of talent. Virginia Madson has NO lines and Sean Young has very few. Richard Jordan, Brad Dourif, Linda Hunt, Freddie Jones, and Patrick Stewart have few scenes and lines. It seems especially sad to see so little of Max Von Sydow. Even Sting's role seems wasted by the fact that his main appearance is in a knife fight with Kyle MacLachlan, the second of two knife fights in the film. But unlike Wolfgang Peterson in Troy (or whoever is doing his combat choreography) Lynch does not know how to film one on one combat with edged weapons.<br /><br />Well, those are the good things which brought me back to this film. As creative as David Lynch was in other films, it is clear he had no feel for science fiction of large scale action or special effects. The one area where his talent might have shown up was in dialogue. And the dialogue seems wooden, and almost completely overshadowed by voice-over narration. In a lot of effects, it seems Lynch tries too hard. There is \\"the voice\\" talent with the Bene Gesserit have, and instead of using the subtle technique perfected by George Lucas and Alec Guinness in Star Wars, he overplays it with mechanically changed voices. The large scale combat scenes are similarly botched. Even the droids in George Lucas' combat scenes come off better than the humansoldiers in Dune.<br /><br />The last \\"good\\" things I have to say about this film is that it works better than later adaptations, and it is not so different from the novel that you can't blame some of the difficulties on the exceedingly complicated plot of the original novel.ay about this film is that it works better than later adaptations, and it is not so different from the novel that you can't blame some of the difficulties on the exceedingly complicated plot of the original novel.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|After waiting for what seem like forever, Lady Antebellum has released one of the best albums yet. From start to finish this album is nothing but AWESOME. It's hard to pick just one favorite song, when they all rock! If you don't own this album, click the 'buy' button NOW!!! It will be the best $9 bucks you've spent, i guarantee it!! You won't be disappointed!
B003PGNBNY|5.0|I bought this DVD owned, and it looked like it was brand new! I absolutely love how clean the disc is and how it even came with the original papers inside of it.
0307477479|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  It's almost impossible to put down.  Much like a short story, this book gives you everything you need to know, but just barely- you finish it not quite sure of all the details of what happened, but with enough that you can imagine them, almost as if you were a part of the story but not present for quite everything.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|The package was wrapped with care, and my cd arrived without a scratch on it. Although I paid more to get it here than on iTunes, I thought it was worth it because the closest store from here is a 15 minute walk to best buy.

B00006JJ1O|4.0|I don't find anything majorly wrong with either of these singers.  True, one IS better then then the other, but for a duet they're still pretty adequate together.  If we actually compared t.A.T.u to someone like Rebecca Black, I'd much rather be listening to this for hours rather then having to listen to that nasal-y voice even once.  Also, a lot of people have mention about their act of being lesbians and that's why they don't like this group, but really?  How shallow are you?  How shallow do you have to be to actually hate a group, just because they happen to have a different sexual orientation?  It's not like they're talking about having sex with each other or anything, it's just an act.  Overall, I enjoy some of the songs and I prefer the ones that are slower.  To me, t.A.T.u is much better when they have slower songs, so if you'd buy this it for only slow songs, then maybe you'd be better off not.  Many songs on here are fast-paced, techno-like songs.
0553807919|4.0|As a mom of 3 kids from toddler through 'tween, I didn't really learn anything new from \\"The Whole Brain Child\\". That said, I enjoyed reading about the neuroscience behind such tried-and-true parenting strategies such as helping children to name their feelings, using humor (what the authors call \\"playful parenting\\") to defuse conflicts, teaching children visualization techniques to overcome anxieties, helping children put themselves in others' shoes, and so on. The book is easy-to-read and accessible to a general audience. I would highly recommend it to new parents.
B00004XPPE|5.0|Just about anyone who came of age during the Cold War will find Fail Safe chilling and still relevant.  Deterrence was based on the very real prospect of mutually assured destruction.  In spite of right-wing think tank products such as the late Herman Kahn's On Thermonuclear War, it was clear to anyone who thought about it with a head unclogged by ideological absurdities and half-baked policy wonk speculations that an exchange of ballistic missile-borne nuclear warheads between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. would leave the world uninhabitable.  And that was before anyone had foreseen the phenomenon we now know as nuclear winter.<br /><br />In spite of that, there were vainglorious, Kissingeresque hawks on both sides.  Walter Matthau does a superb job, almost salivating at the prospect of finding out if tough and violent convicts protected by their prison walls, or organizationally savvy file clerks, insulated by shelves and cabinets loaded with thick reams of paper, would prevail in a war among the likely survivors.  Yes, as we learned in Viet Nam and Iraq, ivory tower intellectuals, chicken hawks to a man, can be very dangerous, destroying the lives of thousands of patriotic soldiers and ordinary civilians.  In Fail Safe it's the career soldiers and airmen, people who have actually experienced war, who prevail, at least long enough to provide painful but essential perspective.<br /><br />Henry Fonda, not one of my favorite people, but perfect for the role of the U.S. President during an unprecedented international crisis, also understands what's at stake.  He, and eventually the Soviet leadership, understand that complex systems will eventually malfunction, and may bring us to the brink of mutual annihilation.  They also know that even accidents acknowledged as eventually inevitable may exact a terrible toll.  A good faith gesture that costs millions of lives to restore a still-precarious balance.  A horrible trade-off, the price paid to save the world, at least for now.<br /><br />The flip side of Fail Safe is made all too real by Richard Widmark's portrayal of the Captain of a state-of-the-art enemy submarine chaser in The Bedford Incident.  Just as machines inevitably malfunction, men pushed too hard for too long become exhausted, error prone, and desperate.  When the people in charge are so Hell-bent on wreaking havoc on an audacious and resourceful enemy, the eventual results are easy to foresee.  I've never known if the torpedoes fired, in one last act of defiant fatalism by the doomed nuclear submarine were nuclear tipped.  That only makes The Bedford Incident a more sobering complement to Fail Safe.<br /><br />During the Cold War, the enemies were well-defined and mutually accessible, subject to a reign of destruction that neither side wanted and both sought to prevent.  Today, with nuclear proliferation occurring in both nationalistically celebratory and surreptitious ways, there are more ideologues willing, perhaps even eager, to destroy the world.  Actually, it seems odd that it hasn't happened yet.<br /><br />Fail Safe is still pertinent, but it's also a film for another era.  It's pertinent because nuclear weapons are at least as destructive as in the 1960's, and the systems that control them are even more complex.  It's a film for another time, however, because current international circumstances are laced with heavier and more varied doses of fanaticism, and there are more enemies who are harder to find.  Makes the Cold War sound like a good thing, a precarious set of circumstances, to be sure, but one with built-in stabilizers, even if they were imperfect.w.<br /><br />The flip side of Fail Safe is made all too real by Richard Widmark's portrayal of the Captain of a state-of-the-art enemy submarine chaser in The Bedford Incident.

B004LWZW24|4.0|I had put off watching the movie because it had not gotten the greatest of reviews...but boy was I pleasantly surprised when watching this!  So glad I rented it.  Thought it was really creepy and very well done without all the 'in your face' gore.  Not that I don't enjoy that as well, but it was a nice change. I would definately recommend this movie and I would watch it again on Halloween night with the family!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Room, is a story (as seen and told by a 5 year old) Jack, and his \\"MA\\". Ma and Jack have been in \\"Room\\" for Jack's entire short life.<br /><br />I found the story monotonous and at times so very boring.  Chapter after Chapter you read Jack's views and description of everything.  I found myself reading some lines over and over to try and understand what Jack was talking about.  I really did not feel any connection with  Jack and Ma, actually, sometimes I just found him so annoying.  For example always asking \\"Can I have some\\", that line for some reason just drove me nuts throughout the book.  I get the fact that all Jack knows is from being in the \\"Room\\" however, please give me some different perspectives, it was just driving me crazy reading only what Jack saw and his language.<br /><br />The best part of the Book is the section with the \\"Great Escape\\" during those chapters i could not put the book down, however, once \\"Great Escape\\" was over, it was back to being boring.<br />I found the book to be very frustrating.<br />Hope this helps!

B003F3NDWG|5.0|I would say this is the best show on TV right now.  It has everything you could possibly want.  Action, suspense, romance, comedy, drama, you name it.  The chemistry between Nathan and Stana is electric and puts shows like Bones to shame.  If you are looking for a great show to watch with the family, or just looking for something amazing to watch then look no further.  This show is HIGHLY recommended.  Give it a try and you will fall in love with Castle.
B00000I41G|5.0|I'm a long time fan of Kenny Burrell and this cd is a great addition to my collection of recordings.  I would recommend it to any jazz guitar fan.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is incredible.  It also does something that a lot of other shows fail to do.  It gets better as it goes.  Season 1 is good tv, season 2 is excellent tv, and season 3 was legendary.  After the season 3 finale I spent the whole summer being really antsy waiting for it to return.  The writers know exactly how to hook you.  If you are looking for something new to watch look no further.  If you are a Castle fan then show support for the best show currently on television!  Buy!

0786956291|1.0|The \\"red box\\" is a complete waste of your money. The \\"Player's book\\" included in the set is little more than a D&D version of the old \\"Choose your own Adventure\\" books, giving the player absolutely no way to create a character without going through the adventure. It's basically a \\"play it once and stick it on the shelf\\" product. If you want to get involved in D&D, you are much better off finding a local shop that holds \\"Encounter\\" events and buying the Rules Compendium
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I do not know what Lucas means by original.. We all know he is the creator but he has clearly lost his touch on the essence of Star Wars over the years. I am impressed with the image and sound improvements BUT all of the additional scenes are idiotic with childish humor. If Lucas wants to make more money he should just remake the actual originals with the improved image and sound, that's actually what the ORIGINAL fan wants. Personally I believe that at some point a true artist has to know when to stand back and admire his creation.. unfortunately Lucas isn't there yet.
B004TLM284|1.0|Britney may have been a great performer at one point in time, but it seems like she has given up.<br /><br />Her songs are generic pop songs that can be sung by anyone with acess to auto tune.<br />I would rather have Ke$ha on these tracks because at least Ke$ha writes her own music.<br /><br />Britney is not musically inclined whatsoever. Her voice sounds all nasal and like a robot.<br /><br />There are better singers out there. Britney needs to stop recording music.
034552554X|4.0|I loved this book.  Victoria is believable to me, her inability to attach a neccessary defense against the 32 foster families who failed to love her and make her feel wanted and safe.  I really like Elizabeth, and Grant, and especially Renata.  This book was a beautiful look at unconditional love.....I feel it could have been a really good inspirational/Christian novel with very little effort.....yes, Victoria brings a lot of trouble on herself, but you want to see her succeed......I love her promising career in flowers.  I was loving the direction of that, and although I understand the pregnancy storyline, it took too long, and seemed somehow detached.  That kept it from being five stars to me.
B0058VA2U4|3.0|So everyone is now going gaga over the new Anthrax. Sure, it's great that Joey is back, let's face it the Bush stuff blew.  However, i've always had a problem with Anthrax. First, they have rap metal tendencies which proves they aren't true metallers and have false metal tendencies. Rap and metal do not belong together, no matter what freaking Scott Ian thinks. You want rap metal, go listen to those fags Limp Bizkit.  Even with Joey back in there, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the vocals are way too poppy.  They don't deserve to be in the Big 4 (neither does Metallicrap or Megadeth, either).  The REAL Big 4 are Slayer, Exodus, Overkill, and Testament!!  Compare this latest Anthrax with the latest from Exodus or Overkill, and tell me which one is true to thrash metal.  I rest my case.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|In a dystopian future where the United States has collapsed and brutal regime has taken its place, young Katniss must participate in the Hunger Games. The games are a yearly spectacle, a televised fight to the death between 24 teenagers selected by lot. Think Gladiators + American Idol + Survivor. Katniss was forced to volunteer for the games in order to save her younger sister. It is basically a death sentence. This story is sad, violent, at times touching, at times even a bit humorous (in a ghoulish way), and often terrifying. I will have to read the entire series.
1609611543|5.0|I've lived my whole life (I'm 34 now) with heartburn two to three times a day. I always thought it was acidic foods that did it. But after reading Wheat Belly and learning that wheat is quite acidic in your system and suffering through an entire night of heartburn that caused me to not sleep all night, I decided to give it up cold. That was almost 3 weeks ago and I have not have ONE heartburn attach. That's absolutely incredible. I haven't changed anything else about how I eat, aside from the wheat elimination. I'd recommend eliminating wheat for anyone, even those who don't think they have any adverse reactions to it. Read the book and you will see what it's doing in your body and you'll agree.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|It took me a long time to get my wife to watch this movie the first time, but once she did, she became absolutely obsessed with it. She has now, in the last year or so, watched it well over fifty times!<br /><br />This Blu-ray set is great because it includes a lot of special features not included on the DVD, which are very cool to watch. Plus, of course, it's high-definition.

B005EZJ3MW|5.0|And now for something completely different. If you are a died-in-the-wool Lovatic who lives and dies by her previous albums, you might or might not like this one. But it is a great album which, by some miracle, shows Demi's amazing singing has actually improved in recent years.  There's no more rock music on this album, it is all dance or R&B styles, some of it could even be placed as Adult Contemporary, that catch-all of singable melodic pop that includes Sarah McLachlan.  For me it all comes down to that voice.  And this album is an extravaganza of that voice.  It is everywhere, harmonizing with itself much of the time.  We've said goodbye to guitar, bass and drums for the most part here.  But they were always dispensable, after all.  This time, the songs are better quality, and so is the singing, so who needs a band?
0307595862|2.0|As with his earlier novel,  REDBREAST,  I admire  Nesbo's  imagination, his deep knowledge of forensics,  police procedurals  and etc.  in THE SNOWMAN.  I'm very fond of Harry Hole,  and  the love story between him and the beautiful Rakel. But Nesbo  seems to NEED to inject so many peripheral chaacters into his stories,  the reader becomes confused,  keeps going back and forth to identify these people,  some of whom have NO PURPOSE,  and eventually fade away, or die off.<br /><br />Its fine to set the reader up for the 'outting' of a killer,  then find out  it's not the killer,  so that  the mystery deepens.  But after awhile we intuitively know we are on a wild-goose chase,  and begin to lose interest in who the REAL killer is.  By the time  we got to Mathias as the villain,  I no longer cared!  The book slid out of my hand several times, and I realized I had fallen asleep out of boredom.  A snowman as metaphor is fine,  but really how could a killer build a HUGE,  larger-than -life snowman on the second floor of a house???  More specifically,  WHY?????<br /><br />The author shoots himself in the foot here because...when a scene is so far-fetched,  so childish and unbelievable that the reader  sits back, pondering the logic of this...the author has lost him.  Irrevocably.  As with REDBREAST,  by the end of THE SNOWMAN,  I no longer cared about the  CHARACTERS, JUSTICE, LIFE OR DEATH.  My overall reaction was a big yawn.<br /><br />With respect to the Norwegian culture and  language,  I also found the profusion of characters names,  street names,  town and city names,  competely confusing and in places almost identical.  I have never written this before in a review but...<br />neither of these books were a pleasant experience for me.  At the end I was only aware of hours wasted.  Again,  a prime example of  readers being  duped by  excess publicity of a mediocre book.

B002VKE1K2|5.0|I've watched my share of Paranormal shows, re-enactments, and Hollywood flicks.  This was one of the best paranormal, low budget Hollywood films I've seen.  The filmography was done really well and there are scenes I'm STILL wondering how they got the effects they did.  You will have to use your imagination a bit, but all in all I highly recommend this movie.
B0000047CX|5.0|I was so happy to see this cd available, and I couldn't wait to receive it. The shipping was really quick, and it was brand new, just as described. I would definitely buy from you again, and recommend to a friend.
B004LWZW42|3.0|I was expecting a lot as I had heard many positive reviews of this movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was a little underwhelmed and the main positive I took out of it was the fact we saw how many of the key X-men characters came alive, particularly, Charles Xavier and Magneto. Their friendship was particularly interesting having seen their intimate knowledge of each other in the later X-men movies.<br /><br />Yes, there's clever action sequences, Kevin Bacon as a too far-fetched Nazi villain with super powers, and a number of young characters with some pretty groovy special talents, but I wouldn't recommend it. Sure there are many worse movies, but lots better.

0439023521|4.0|I am 51 and I liked the Hunger Games, though I know it is written for teens. It is the best of the trilogy, be warned. I did also like Catching Fire. Mockingjay, the 3rd book, was more disappointing. There are obvious flaws in the trilogy, like Katniss seeming to go through a personality change unrelated to the story (the games). It comes off as a error in the writing and I personally would have rather seen her come out as a stronger female character in the end. Other flaws seemed to be the author's limited imagination, it is hard to see a future where there are hovercraft and cures for major injuries, yet a coal mine is still a necessity. I'm not saying I didn't like the book. I did think it was a good idea for a book, just maybe could have been more continuity, worked out the inconsistencies.

She is a completely different person than the girl who originally volunteered to take her sister's place, the girl who hunted illegally in the woods, who's best friend was a guy, the girl who seemed a little more tough and confident than she does in the end. Even the person she eventually ends up with is not who I saw as the best possible mate. It seems like Collins took the easy way out in key situations by Katniss actually not being there, only hearing about what happened later. Collins also takes the low road in choosing Katniss' eventual mate by probably going with who she thought would be the popular choice. Which is another example of Katniss just going with the flow, floating along as a spectator in her life, too bad, Collins could have made Katniss a strong example for the young girls who will be reading this...
B005GIS1WA|1.0|Amazon never allowed me to view this movie even the next day after purchase.  I paid for nothing, but supposedly I will be receiving a refund, so that will be good to get back......the time I wasted trying to use their system to watch a movie??  Lost forever...grrr..

B00000B9BD|5.0|A friend recommended I listen to \\"Benedictus\\" by the Strawbs.I missed this CD back in the 70's as Classical was occupying my listener choices then. I heard of the Strawbs but know I am a true fan. 'Benedictus' is fabulous and made the right point for me at the right time but the whole album 'Grave New World\\" is a must listen. Was David Cousins looking into the future? Now I am visiting with Sandy Denny music and loving this new journey.
B00005JLD4|4.0|It seems hard enough having to cross from one end of Australia to another, but it was extraordinary to see a movie about a group of girls who took this journey TWICE, and walking the whole time under some harsh conditions at that. It was nice getting introduced to a part of history through a movie like this--the characters are genuine, and I would imagine them to be that way in 1930s Australia. There is also a lot of material in this movie that would be great for a discussion with those who like it. Plus, from what I learned through the movie's extras, the filmmakers casted real Aborigine girls to play the roles of the girls, and THOSE girls would keep running away from the studio! You should really see the rest of the commentary on the DVD too.<br /><br />As far as entertaining goes, I think some people will not enjoy this movie. Through the eyes of such folks, the movie will seem overly drawn out and boring. This is really one of those films that you would enjoy if you're interested in the historical genre, or you like watching long journeys.

I was glad it was so short. and thought it was strange that the preview of a soon to be release that came after mile 81 was longer than mile 81 itself. Of course I will give King another chance in the future, because maybe in the hour or two it seems like he spent on this, maybe he had a headache or was just having a bad day.

B00169N0BK|1.0|I am not a professional photographer... but very capable of following technical directions. When my Color Munki did not work... would not calibrate my Canon Printer and iMac Display, the X-Rite Service Department immediately blamed it on Apple and Canon. They told me to call Apple and Canon and get updated software. Of course Apple and Canon proceeded to tell me that it was not their purpose in life to write software for X-Rite... but it was clearly X-Rite's responsibility to write proper, compatible software for Apple and Canon. Not wanting to participate in the \\"blame game\\" any more... I promptly packaged up the Color Munki and sent is back for a return to Amazon. Thank you Amazon Prime! I was so happy that I did not have to deal with X-Rite in the return process. All I ever wanted was an iMac display that was calibrated/color-matched to my my Canon Pro 9500 MII Printer. Back to ground Zero. Any recommendations out there?

B0013ND30W|4.0|I am a Disney collector, as are many people.  I was surprised to find such a low and standard pricing for Sleeping Beauty (Blu-Ray/DVD Combo) on Amazon.  Since it went back into the vault, I figured people would price gouge.<br /><br />I did have a problem with my order however.  When i first ordered this movie, it said \\"New Condition\\", which is Factory Sealed and most likely with a cardboard sleeve.  I patiently and eagerly awaited for it by mail.  I received it only to be disappointed.  It was not sealed, had not sleeve, had the DVD version just put in the case, and some obvious wear and tear.  I paid what I thought was a new price for this movie.  I contacted the company, which took me a couple days.  Once I finally got a hold of them, I explained my situation and they were very helpful.  In the end, I returned my first copy of Sleeping Beauty and ordered another copy.  When I finally received this copy from another company, it was great and up to my expectations.  The moral of the story is that it may say \\"New Condition\\" but when buying from anyone but Amazon there is a higher risk that it might not be as advertised.<br /><br />Overall, I am completely satisfied with my product, once I received the copy that met my expectations.  My copy had the cardboard sleeve which had no damage whatsoever.  The discs were not scratched and it was wrapped in original factory plastic.  One thing to mention is with this combo pack, Disney sloppily put the DVD version in a cardboard sleeve and stuck it in the plastic wrap around the case.  I think it was a last minute decision on Disney's part.

B005LY4B0A|1.0|Having the spider take the less damaging path only under certain conditions is not challenging. It is cheap. There are many puzzles that I went online to see the solution only to find out the reason I did not solve it myself, is they had the spider take a foolish path.
B001AQO446|5.0|It's great to have an extended version of this movie, but all the extended shots do suffer from poor image quality in with the whites are clamped down giving it a strange look. But, if you have it on in the background and want the movie to last forever, it works.  Outside of that, come one, this is a unique and great comedy/musical.

B000002L9B|4.0|I was checking out someone's listmania about Prince albums & that someone said something really stupid about this album. He suggested that Kiss was the only thing on this album that people actually care about....well,he's probably talking about the kind of silly people who just want something to play in the background & don't bother to sit down,close their eyes & take it ALL in. You know,the downloading generation who just listen to the big hit and that's it, instead of exploring the WHOLE album like we had to do back in the day. Well,guess what...guess what song I usually skip when listening to this album..Kiss! HA!<br />Matter of fact, the 2 songs that come before and after Kiss are much more interesting songs. And so are-Christopher Tracy's Parade, Mountains, Life Can Be So Nice, Venus De Milo and the sensuous Under The Cherry Moon.<br />The people who don't like those songs probably aren't familiar with something called MUSICIANSHIP.<br /><br />The more I think about this,I get annoyed..Kiss is the least musically interesting song on Parade and look at how popular it is,I mean, what does that say about the masses? The other singles that were released from this album(all better than Kiss)didn't have the chart success that Kiss had, which shows how silly most people are. There are people who never bought a Prince album in their lives,who love that song.  Maybe if there were more kids growing up listening to Mountains, we would have more instrumentalists (esp. in the \\"black community\\") instead of DJs & people doing \\"looped beats\\"...whatever that means.
B005PDJBRU|2.0|I really enjoyed seasons 1-4 of Doctor Who, but when David Tennant switched to Matt Smith the show took a terrible turn. I dislike the new doctor and the humor of the show seems too childish now. I was very sad when Russell T. Davies, the head writer, quit. This left Steven Moffat in charge, in season 1, he wrote the amazing episode Empty Child, he continued to write amazing episodes since, until season 5. Once Steve began writing for the new doctor his writing became too jumbled and many questions you'd have from watching an episode would remain unanswered. It all became too confusing and I found myself continually asking why and how certain things were happening. I also dislike the new companion Amy and I believe that Rory is a pointless character. During seasons one through four, I was addicted to Doctor Who, sometimes watching up to six episodes in a day, but when season 5 came out, I was incredibly disappointed. I watched the first few episodes then almost quit all together. The only reason I still watch now is because I'm waiting for the Doctor to regenerate.
B004AYCWZI|3.0|This book has a good storyline of a young Indian boy growing up in his family's colorful Mumbai restaurant, escaping to the Indian/Pakistani section of depressingly gray London after a tragedy, then discovering the fresh alpine beauty of Lumiere, France. When the family opens an Indian restaurant there, a battle ensues between their neighbor, a ferocious, elderly French chef who demands perfection and elegance, and the father, an unrefined but equally ferocious character who can't understand why this old woman chef hates him. Another tragedy ensues, resulting in Mme Mallory taking the boy, Hassan, under her wing to train in French cooking - he is \\"one of those rare chefs who is simply born.\\" Thus begins Hassan Haji's rise to Michelin stardom.<br /><br />Good storyline, lots of interesting cooking tidbits and a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at restaurant life. Unfortunately, if you don't like French cuisine or homey Indian cooking, which apparently include a lot of internal organs as well as feet, you may not find this book so appetizing. There is also an issue of narrative point of view - much of the book is the boy talking, but then suddenly there is a switch to the omniscent narrator, which doesn't make sense. I would have liked more historical information about the family tragedy in India. Hassan was likeable and with some depth, but his father and the complex Mme Mallory were larger than life and almost took over the book. The ending was actually a little sad, yet hopeful. Overall, a good story with interesting characters and twists, and the author has a way with words, but the narration issue got to me. That, and I wish I had felt more empathy towards Hassan who is all work and almost no play.

B000056TKC|5.0|Fricsay's control of the orchestra seems nearly absolute.  The first three movements are measured and deliberate, not slow or wooden, just very, very well controlled and impeccably phrased.  By contrast, the choral portion borders on histrionism, but for all its exhiliration it remains balanced and dignified.  I am tempted to say this recording is like the 1963 Karajan recording turned on its head.  Where Karajan is wild, Fricsay is measured, and where Karajan becomes somewhat measured, Fricsay goes wild.  Both are exemplary performances, and I cannot recommend one over the other.
B000001FLA|4.0|In the 1980's Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen was a guitar revolutionary with is neo-classical guitar playing and popularized the art of \\"shredding\\". I'm not Malmsteen's biggest fan and he was not the first guitarist who was influenced by classical music (Ritchie Blackmore was there before him) but I'll give him credit for his playing and his influences on some of the Power/Symphonic Metal bands. While his first solo album Rising Force showed his talents as a guitarist and featured a heavy dose of instrumentals his third album, 1986's Trilogy sees Yngwie going towards a more commercial direction and tends to sound more pop and radio friendly like much of the Glam bands of that era. Yet Yngwie still shreds, produces amazing solos and excellent guitars in general. This album marks another change for Yngwie as singer Mark Boals replaces departed singer Jeff Scott Sotto. Malmsteen would collaborate with many singers (Joe Lynn Turner, Doogie White, Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens just to name a few) and everyone has their favorite but it's fair to say that Mark Boals had a good voice and was a competent singer.<br /><br />\\"You Don't Remember\\" opens the album with crunchy guitars and accompanying keyboards in the background. This song indicates a more radio friendly sound but is still a hard rocking song, even though it hints at commercialism it's still a good catchy song. \\"Liar\\" is much more aggressive and is more guitar oriented, a heavier track and one of the best on Trilogy. \\"Queen In Love\\" has been described as \\"cheesy\\" by other reviewers but I think it's a good 80's pop-flavored song that's undeniably catchy. What can I say?  I do enjoy some cheese now and then.  \\"Crying\\" to me is a personal highlight of Trilogy. It's really as if Yngwie is crying through his guitar, its powerful instrumental music. Yngwie shows his classical guitar skills and also demonstrates that he's not all about speed. \\"Fury\\" is one of the heavier tracks on Trilogy and it is also one of the songs on which Boals is most effective. \\"Fire\\" is suffers from having a bad, cheesy chorus that brings the song down when it had potential. \\"Dark Ages\\" is a good slow, heavy song with interesting lyrics and story. \\"Magic Mirror\\" sees Mark Boals going for the high notes  but it doesn't really go anywhere unfortunately. Album closer \\"Trilogy Suit Op: 5\\" is very much the equivalent classical music on guitar, it sounds incredible and it shows just how much of a virtuoso Malmsteen is. It's not surprising considering Malmsteen's love of classical music. This one is epic; it has many time changes and it's the Yngwie show. Of course he's backed up by solid music. This is for those who are into displays of over the top soloing and represents Malmsteen doing what he does best, those who aren't will find little of interest in this song.<br /><br />Overall Trilogy is not Yngwie Malmsteen's best or even his most popular album and while it goes in more of a commercial direction than his two previous effort Rising Star (1984) and Marching Out (1985). Yngwie is still true to himself and on Trilogy he's still an impressive guitarist. The songs are more mainstream and there were some radio tracks such as \\"You Don't Remember\\" and \\"Queen In Love\\" but he remains true to himself. I have a soft spot for Trilogy because while it's not my favorite Yngwie Malmsteen record it was my first. I remember thinking the cover with Yngwie fighting a dragon was a cool image.  Trilogy features some excellent guitar work, good new singer and a mix of catchy/heavy/instrumental songs. 3.5 stars/5.s most effective. \\"Fire\\" is suffers from having a bad, cheesy chorus that brings the song down when it had potential. \\"Dark Ages\\" is a good slow, heavy song with interesting lyrics and story. \\"Magic Mirror\\" sees Mark Boals going for the high notes  but it doesn't really go anywhere unfortunately.

B000006CCG|5.0|W.A.S.P.'s 1984 self-titled debut (also known back then as Winged Assassins and I Wanna Be Somebody) is raw, aggressive and nasty fun. The band emerged from Los Angeles, California but they're heavier than the average Glam/Hair Metal band and they have other topics than those bands which makes them much more appealing to the dedicated Metal fan. On could take a look at the cover or the band live and think they're a Glam band, but the truth is that W.A.S.P. is a heavy metal band disguised as a Glam band. The band is more Alice Cooper than Poison, and from the controversy they generated and their live shows they're what could be called a Shock-Rock band let's put it like that. Band leader Blackie Lawless' voice is certainly not soft like the Glam bands, his voice is aggressive and in your face and he serves the lyrics with a side of attitude. Chris Holmes proves himself to be an excellent guitarist on W.A.S.P's debut and along with Randy Piper their playing here proves that they're both competent guitarists.<br /><br />The first W.A.S.P. album has some of the band's best songs and terrific anthems like \\"I Wanna Be Somebody\\" and \\"Love Machine\\" that could have been hits. Fans know that Blackie Lawless will never play \\"Animal F*** Like A Beast\\" live again because of his personal beliefs but whether he likes it or not, it remains a W.A.S.P. classic and for so many of us the introduction to this great band. \\"Animal\\" wasn't included on the album release in order to prevent it from being banned but now it has been added to the album on CD to open the album which is a great edition. \\"I Wanna Be Somebody\\" was a single and one of the first songs that got me into the band to begin with. It starts heavy with a chugging riff and Lawless screams the lyrics, this is certainly no soft song but it's a catchy anthem and one of my favorite W.A.S.P. songs. \\"L.O.V.E. Machine\\" is in the vein of \\"I Wanna Be Somebody\\" in that it's a catchy anthem.  This one is slightly softer and is more accessible or commercial but it's an excellent song. \\"Sleeping (In the Fire)\\" is a softer and more melodic song that I quite like; it's almost a power ballad but it is an edge and lyrics that would prevent it from radio airplay. I think this is one of the band's best songs. I won't go through every song but others like \\"B.A.D\\", \\"School Daze\\", \\"On Your Knees\\" and \\"The Flame\\" make this a stellar debut album.<br /><br />The 1997 CD re-releases added 3 extra songs to the original album: \\"Animal F*** Like A Beast\\", \\"Show No Mercy\\" and the Rolling Stones cover \\"Paint It Black\\". I think it's great that the record company added \\"Animal\\" and \\"Show No Mercy\\" should have been on the original album to begin with \\"Paint It Black\\" is not an awful cover version but it's not a great one either, it's clearly done W.A.S.P. style but it doesn't really cut it for me.<br /><br />What makes this album even more memorable was that this was my first W.A.S.P. album. The band went on to release some other very good albums like The Last Command and The Headless Children but there's something really special about this one for me. 4.5/5 stars, a great debut album that still sounds terrific today.commercial but it's an excellent song. \\"Sleeping (In the Fire)\\" is a softer and more melodic song that I quite like; it's almost a power ballad but it is an edge and lyrics that would prevent it from radio airplay.

0307887960|3.0|First let me say, I am sure this book has help many people reach their weight loss goal.    I was on pins and needles waiting for this book to become available in the States and ordered it in advance.  I read the book as soon as it came and basically it's a low carb diet.  Deja vu.    So, I talked my husband into the buddy system because it would be easier for me and we could have this experience together.  My husband loves his veggies - the Attack phase went over like a lead balloon.  Protein only. To me it just seem like the 1990s Atkins all over. The next phase is Cruise which is alternating protein days with veg/protein days.  You stay in this phase until you are close to your goal weight.  For me that would be a long time. This wasn't going to work, so I started researching alternatives that allowed vegetables and protein everyday.   So long story short:  Take a look at the New Atkins Diet website before purchasing the Dukan book.  Take a look at the low carb friends website as well for recipes.  Eat what you want (hopefully healthy) but count your net carbs.  I restricted my net carbs at the beginning to 20 and then slowly added more - making sure I continued to loose weight.  We both have had great success and can eat more than just protein everyday.  Also, we are not following one diet - we are just aware of the net carbs we are taking in everyday.  This book is a life saver for many people but for us it just didn't gel with our lifestyle.  This may the right item for you to purchase - but do yourself a favor and poke around a little bit before you hit buy.
B0057MFA42|5.0|Filmed about a month after the release of Nevermind, they are really clicking here.  A nice mix of early stuff, some b-sides (haven't seen Been A Son, but they were spot-on with their performance of Aneurysm) and key tracks from Nevermind.  The video and sound quality are excellent - it looks like it was shot yesterday, rather than 20 years ago.  This is a must have - a fine document of one of those turning points in rock music history.

0385534639|4.0|I started reading this book with the idea that it would be a cross between Hunger Games and Twilight.  In many ways I can see the comparisons (i.e. supernatural occurrences, forbidden love) but it stands on its own merit too.  The characters were enjoyable and I became invested in their fate quickly.  Some of the events were pretty illogical so as a reader I just took it at face value with out really necessitating an explanation....especially the end.... probably ready for a sequel.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This was an extremely inspirational movie! It was amazing to see how much strength and courage in one person could cause so much change for so many people. The movie began with Gandhi's assassination in 1948 and the funeral service and then goes back in time to when he was an attorney in South Africa in 1893.  During this time he realizes how bad Indian people are being treated in South Africa due to racial discrimination and begins his non-violent protests to gain some rights for the Indian people in Africa.     After his success there he returns to India where he continues his non-violent, non-cooperation campaign there against the British Empire. The British government controls everything and the Indian people are treated very poorly in their own land. Millions of Indian people follow Gandhi's campaign against the British, but problems begin to occur such as protestors being killed. Gandhi eventually tries to stop the campaign by fasting until everyone stops protesting so no one else will be killed. Gandhi spends time in jail and protesting eventually begins again. The British is eventually pushed to the point that they grant India independence.    Unfortunately after all of his work gaining rights for Indians in South Africa and being such a leader in gaining India's independence from the British things were still unsettled in India.  The end of the movie was about the war between religions. The Muslims and the Hindus began fighting and killing each other. Gandhi again refuses to eat until the fighting stops. Eventually it does, but India becomes separated into two nations: India and Pakistan. He spends his last days continually trying to bring peace between the two nations and religions. In the end the movie comes around to the beginning where he is shot and killed by one of his own.   This movie relates to world religions by showing what religious tensions can cause.  Gandhi went through all those struggles to bring his people out of the pain and suffering they were experiencing under other governments due to racial inequality, oppression, etc. Then they turn on each other because they believed in religious inequality. We see this all over the world in all nations just maybe not to this extreme. Gandhi's belief was that all people can live together regardless of our race, gender, religion, caste, etc. Instead of people wasting so much time being prejudice and hating they need to take the time to learn about others and their way of life. This is a wonderful movie. It could be a great learning tool and inspiration to all.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|I love this movie and Liam Neeson is a great hero. I know that he was from Schindler's List. The story keeps you guessing almost all the way. It's like the Fugitive, mixed with North By North West. This dvd only has one bounes feature, but that's ok because, there's very little sfx in the movie. No cg monsters, no giant waves in this one; just great acting, two big car stunts, knock down drag-out fighting, and one big explosion.

I received the album the day before it was released and have literally listened to it at least 30 times since then, each time falling more in love.  It is my favorite album of theirs and my favorite song is Dancing away with my heart because it reminds me of high school prom and that one person you couldn't wait to dance with and wished the night wouldn't end because of.

B0051QO4QY|5.0|Lady Gaga's third album is one that is a masterpiece, a saga, just like her public life and infamous outfits - the party never ends! She continues her musical journey as she introduces more of an old-school \\"rock\\" sound with more emphasis on guitars (like in \\"You and I\\"), but still manages to keep the addictive dance beat in songs like \\"Judas\\". She manages to continually top herself since she is the only competitor in her field, but she does it amazing gracefully and still keeps true to her roots while changing and morphing. There is no end to what she can create, and \\"Born This Way\\" underscores that point! You must listen to this album because your admiration of Mother Monster will continue to grow!

B003C5FMEE|3.0|The article that prompted me to order this raved on his musical talents. It's a good album but not great. Maybe more to the song selection that had limited appeal to me. Try it, though, i think you'll like it.

0142002038|5.0|I read and enjoyed many of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels when I was about 12.  I recent enjoyed re-reading Dr No.<br /><br />Fleming's Bond novels don't have a good reputation amongst critics.  In my opinion this is mostly unjustified.  Although it's true that the quality of his writing is quite variable, it has to be considered in the context of its antecedents: the British `shockers' of John Buchan, Sapper et al.  In that genre the quality of the writing is of lesser importance than the wish-fulfillment of the authors, the acceptance by readers of which is a crucial determinant of whether the `shocker' in question is considered to be a success.  By this measure most of the Bond novels, including Dr No, can hardly be considered less than tremendously successful.<br /><br />The character Dr No is a kind of Neitschiean superman; a man who has sacrificed his humanity to achieve his goal of total power.  Bond, to his credit, seems to see through this and tells No that what he has is the illusion of power, although he doesn't go as far as to tell No that he has sacrified his humanity for a meaningless goal (perhaps because Bond has weaknesses in that respect too.<br /><br />James Bond is, for the most part, a cypher.  Fleming may have created his character with the intention of him appearing to be a `blunt instrument' but it also allows readers to overlay their own personalities over Bond's and turn Fleming's wish-fulfillment into the reader's own.<br /><br />Fleming is a master of creating vivid and believable settings, even when their existence is improbable.  In Dr No he makes use of contrasting environments, such as the Crab Quay seen by outsiders on the surface and the very different underground environment created by Dr No.  Tropical lushness on the beach of Crab Quay contrasts with its stinking industrialized interior.  In Jamaica the ordered pattern of life is interrupted by the activities of Dr No's operatives.  Rainy London contrasts with tropical Jamaica.<br /><br />Fleming's style is highly personal and seems difficult for other authors to emulate, considering the lack of success enjoyed by almost all of the Bond continuation novels. (I think Geoffrey Dever's Carte Blanche is a rare success among the continuations although he doesn't appear to attempt to emulate Fleming's style.  Fleming was a successful newspaper journalist and his style reflects this, in addition to a strong capacity for vividly describing location, which is also reflected in his journalistic travel writing published under the title Thrilling Cities.al and seems difficult for other authors to emulate, considering the lack of success enjoyed by almost all of the Bond continuation novels.

B003Y5H556|5.0|A very good movie, this version with the alternate ending is a perfect mix between original version and a dark story!
B002T44ZYW|2.0|I never watched Laguna Beach, The Hills, The City or any other MTV produced \\"reality\\" series. I guess this book is written for people that actually enjoyed those shows because I know it was rather boring and simply written. The simplistic sentences and \\"drama\\" reminded me of those awful teen novels without any type of plot or direction. L.A. Candy really just falls to the wayside for me. With other authors that are more relatable with a better sense of style, there's no reason to read this at all. How it got onto best seller lists I will never know.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|This cd is a must buy for all Lenny Kravitz fans.It is a combination of good, strong lyrics, catchy tunes and awesome guitar riffs and brass. This cd will make you fall in love with Lenny's music all over again. I smell Grammy gold here. There are some strong strongs like 'black and white america' and 'faith of a child'.<br />The guitar riffs that make Lenny famous are to be found in 'come and get it' 'everything' and 'rock star city life'.<br />He has come back with a real bang. This is one of the best albums for the year.

B00004Y6OA|4.0|You can say what you want about Van Halen, but unless you say that they rock, you've got some problems with your eardrums. Of course by \\"Van Halen\\" I am referring to the golden age of the band, that period between 1977 and 1985 when it still had its original lineup and somehow managed to partially re-invent itself with every new album while managing to keep their distinctive, actually unique, sound. Few would say that WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST was the best album of that period, but somehow the very fact that it isn't VAN HALEN I or 1984 is actually part of its charm. It was part of the \\"pre-superstardom\\" VH, when they had about a million devoted fans and seemed to make music primarily for those fans and for themselves, and did a pretty fine job of it.<br /><br />When I think of the albums from this period, it's funny that while they are all different and distinct from each other, they are all exactly the same in terms of structure. You have a couple of mid-tempo, heavy rockers (\\"And the Cradle Will Rock\\", \\"Everybody Wants Some\\") a song or two that shreds hard for its entire length (\\"Fools\\" and \\"Romeo Delight\\"), one or two which are utterly absurd (\\"Loss of Control\\", \\"Could This Be Magic?\\") an instrumental track (\\"Tora! Tora!\\"), some grit-edged, dirty-fingernail songs that are alternatively cynical, bluesy, ironic, and back-handedly funny (\\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\"). WOMEN follows this pattern exactly. Pretty much everything you want and expect from VH is on this album - Dave's ironic wordplay and sudden, unexpected shrieks, Eddie's wailing, faster-than-light guitar solos, Alex's crashing drums, and the beautiful backing vocals of bassist Michael Anthony, who never got proper credit for the pipes his contributions made to the band. As always, the lyrics are a delightful combination of meaningless gibberish and really astute wordplay, and the mood shifts around all over the place, one minute cocky and defiant, then grungy and ill-tempered, then starry-eyed and romantic...but always injected with smartarse irony and backhanded humor. There is also some nice keyboard work - a harbinger of things to come later - and first-rate acoustic guitar. Reslistening to this album made me member those days when we'd blow off shop class and cruise in that beat-up old car with VH in the tapedeck, feeling like sexy desperados. Sure, we probably looked like total dorks, but listening to Van Halen could make you FEEL as cool as Diamond Dave, and in the early-mid 80s that was pretty damn cool indeed.<br /><br />Yeah, WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST is Old Van Halen. And what was the \\"old Van Halen\\", really? It was a band. It was an attitude. It was a sound. It was a symbol you carved into your desk or struck up on bathroom walls. It was a drug that eased the pain of adolescence. An exclusive club that anyone could join, a secret language that only teenagers spoke. It was a look, a feel, a way of approaching music - sometimes facetiously, sometimes angrily, sometimes enigmatically, but always orginally and always in a way that made it possible to hear two seconds of wailing guitar and crashing drums and say instantly, \\"Yep...that's Van Halen.\\"...And then feel a sudden urge to skip class.ys injected with smartarse irony and backhanded humor.

B005C7SXMS|5.0|SUBMARINE is not your typical coming-of-age movie.<br /><br />It is filled with great warmth and wit, and takes a serious look at teen concerns without lapsing into a raunchy style of comedy found in so many movies of this genre.<br /><br />Adapted by screenwriter-director Richard Ayoade from Joe Dunthorne's novel, the story tells of Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts), a sensitive Welsh teenager who does not \\"fit in\\" with his fellow students.  He spends his time daydreaming about how people would react to his death, listening to recordings by French crooners and also plotting how to lose his virginity, preferably with the equally eccentric Jordana (Yasmin Paige), who likes to start fires.<br /><br />Although he seems to hit a home run in his relationship with Jordana, Oliver does have some real world issues that he must confront.  His parents (Noah Taylor, Sally Hawkins) are not getting on well and, in fact, Oliver suspects that Mom is having an affair with the next-door neighbor (Paddy Considine), her old flame.  If that's not bad enough, Jordana's mother has a brain tumor and is facing surgery.<br /><br />How the young man deals with these problems is what growing up is all about.<br /><br />I was quite moved by this charming film.  The performances are exquisite, most of all Sally Hawkins, who is always a delight to watch, and young Roberts.  There may not be any laugh-out-loud moments, but it is quite funny.  SUBMARINE is well worth seeing.<br /><br />DVD extras include a \\"making of\\" featurette and some deleted scenes.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman
B0002KVULG|5.0|Frank Langella and Kate Nelligan, what a pair, on screen.  There are three scenes that can almost make your soul drip from your fingers:  When Count Dracula invites Lucy to dinner, and the palace is alit with those candles,  When they are outside and he almost kisses her neck, and   the third: Every woman who has seen it knows to what I refer.  Eternal love, eternal passion.
B00008BLB8|4.0|For a recording made in 1975, this is still an excellent album with a great sound. I felt in love with this album in 1977 (while living in Venezuela ), and when I was 17 and I was starting to smoke pot. The bands from the 70\\"s in my opinion have been the best overall in the history of American Rock and Roll. Get this album It is a must!, together with Rare Earth(LIVE) are awesome. And Folks.... Keep Rock and Roll alive!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One was like an early Christmas present during a very dark year.  The unashamed enthusiasm in the character's voice, the well-balanced quirkiness of the quest, and the consistently readable pace was nothing less than addictive.
B005DI65L2|5.0|This book was so good - new ideas and processes for learning to live with your dog in a way that they will most surely understand more easily, and hopefully, more happily as well.  I loved this book and the excerpts from her real life dog and stories made me laugh and reminded me of my own dog.  Definitely worth the read and certainly worth the time and I hope my little dog thinks so as well!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Relaxing, challenging, and great fun! Very chill. The graphics are well complimented by the music and the controls and physics of the game are very logical. Quality.
6304698623|1.0|Since \\"The Secret Garden\\" was done rather well (some changes) I expected that this film would mostly follow the book.  If the author is good why make huge changes?  Wow, what a miss this film is!  In the book Sarah Crewe was a princess because of her strength of character.  In the movie she was a princess in the Disneyish way of being a female of a certain age.<br /><br />Besides that the worst change was removing the scene at the bakery in which Sarah gave away most of the buns she had purchased to a girl who was hungrier than she was.  Very important in the book, left out of the movie!<br /><br />I have 5 children (all grown now) but because of this I read a lot of children's book and saw a lot of children's movies.  The book is very strong, required reading.  The movie is not worth a view.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I have never been a huge Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers fan. A good song here and there over the years. I like and respect Petty for his accomplishments but never really found a place in my taste for his previous work.<br /><br />I was flying the redeye from LA and Delta Air Lines had this CD in the entertainment system. I had passed on listening to it on more than a few flights before this one just because TP&H has really not been producing stuff in the past that interested me all that much. I decided to give it a chance and I was completely blown away. Mojo IS the best music that Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers have EVER recorded. I made my brother listen to it and he was completely stunned as well. Who knew that Mike Campbell was such a phenomenal guitar player?<br /><br />Mojo is such a good album that it is hard to describe how good it is without sounding like some kind of crazed super fan of Tom Petty. Trust me, I spent 30+ years being ho-hum about Petty and the Heartbreakers. I still don't care for his previous work all that much but Mojo is a fantastic bunch of songs. I have never bothered to review an album on Amazon but felt so strongly about this one that I had to give a review.<br /><br />My favorites: Running Man's Bible, The Trip to Pirate's cove, Let Yourself Go, Don't Pull Me Over, Lover's Touch and High in the Morning.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Some cynical music fans claimed that Lady A would experience difficulty releasing a new album that even came close to comparing with \\"Need  You Now\\".  I'm happy to report they were wrong. \\"Own the Night\\" is a wonderful follow-up album.  Several tracks stand out including \\"Cold As Stone\\", \\"Dancin' Away with my heart\\", \\"As you turn away\\" , \\"Singing Me Home\\" and of course \\"Just A Kiss\\".  This group is young, fresh, contemporary and SUPER TALENTED.  I've seen them many times in concert and can't wait until my next concert in a few months to watch them perform these new songs I'm falling in love with.  Love, Love, Love this album!

B001NB545Q|5.0|This album was played for me by my older brother just the same week it came out in the 70's on vinyl at his apartment and I loved it back then.  I still love it  but now I can keep it on my phone for me to play whenever I want.  How cool is that.
0439023513|5.0|Wonderful series, and a crazy way to end the books. Not a ending I would expect, super mind thrilling and wonderful.
0316017922|4.0|[[ASIN:0316017930 Outliers: The Story of Success]]  Interesting book which should be on most reading lists for the well informed.  Several quotes and observations from the book regularly appear in print and talking heads spiels, e.g. 10,000 hours needed to really master a subject whether it be sports, computers or music.  Easy read and interesting.

B005DZMP00|4.0|Although not as striking as Vol. 1, this is a great double CD collection of additional tracks from the Dead's legendary tour.  The packaging, however, could have been a little more imaginative.  I expected better from Rhino discs than a completely blank, white interior when the CD package is opened all the way.  Anyhow, enjoy more Dead from (can you believe it?) 40 years ago.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The characters grew into themselves which I love about sequels.  This tends to be what makes or breaks a series.  You really get to know Lena's true feelings about herself.  You also get to know more about Link, Ridley, and of course our hero Ethan.  I really like Ethan as a main character.  He's got a great personality and truly cares about his friends and family.  There are many new characters to get to know, you get much more of Marian, also new additions Liv, Leah, and John Breed.  There's more surprises and twists to come.  A lot of surprises from Amma are included and many twists you wouldn't think possible and really wouldn't be unless you were reading a paranormal YA novel.  This one actually made me love the series enough to buy the short novella on Link (Dream Dark) which includes the first 5 chapters of Beautiful Chaos book 3 in the series coming in October... Now I'm ready for anything!  Great series!
B003L77GH4|5.0|This series is mesmerizing, we couldn't stop watching it. Alot of twist and turns, you never know what is going to happen. I think The Vampire Diaries is better than  True Blood. If you like True Blood you will be hooked on The Vampire Diaries.
B004UA8D1O|5.0|Although some people called this movie crap I just can't imagine why. I even hesitated on purchasing this due to the reviews. Maybe they did not see the 3D version? This movie in 3D is the highest quality 3D I've seen - wow ever actually! It beats all these 3D movies - Avatar, Thor, Narnia, etc. The quality of the 3D has the birds flying out of your TV and the water flowing from your TV.. truly amazing! I thought the story was right on, they did what they had to do to survive. I'm a certified scuba diver and trust me, they followed all the protocols of survival. It was crazy to buddy breathe with a full facemask, that was a desperate attempt for survival for sure, but in the end the outcome was spot on. Great show thru & thru. I even watched it back to back because the 3D graphics were so good I wanted to take it all in again! EXCELLENT choice, great movie!
0385534639|2.0|Weeeellllll, I was really excited about this book. It sounded like it was going to be a moving and magical story involving some of my favorite subjects; circuses, magic, love, mystery, the Victorian era, a little bit of Steampunk.... I read the book through because I kept hoping it would eventually redeem itself. I did not become attached to the characters, the side blurbs about what \\"you\\" were doing were distracting and somewhat pointless, and it didn't have a lot of depth. I felt it was passionless. It could have been so much more. I got to the end and went, \\"Meh.\\"  Because I value books, I will donate my copy to the local library and hopefully someone else will get more out of it than I did.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I think somebody at Amazon must have watched my complete saga on blu ray and then re packaged it before it was shipped to me.  I'm in the process of watching the movies and I'm currently on episode 3.  I don't what people are smoking when they say the prequels don't look good.  The tv we use to watch them on is a 40 inch Samsung lcd and we have a surround sound setup as well.  They look and sound simply amazing.  I was born in 87 so I was pretty young when episode one came out, and I have always enjoyed it.  I've never hated these movies as the die hard star wars fans do, but how can you be a die hard fan of you don't enjoy the prequels....they are apart of the universe that is Star Wars.  To me they are riveting and they tell the story of how Darth Vader came to be, which is a pretty awesome story if you like Star Wars.  These movies are some of the best looking Blu Rays in my collection not to brag but I have a decent one going.  if you haven't already pick yourself up a copy, you won't regret it.  And as for Amazon SOMEONE in your department is opening up merchandise , WATCHING it and re packaging it.  PLEASE find out who this is.  Episode 2 and Episode 3 were at the end of the movie when I put them in my Blu Ray player.  This it not a big nuisance, but if I'm buying a used version I would like the price to come down some.  Thank You, that is all.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Full disclosure, I'm only about halfway through this book. I don't think I'll finish it. I wish I had paid more attention to whether or not this was self-published because it explains a lot of the gaping plot holes, cliched themes, and poor dialogue. Just a note of advice for this author, who I think has potential - first, know your audience. Is this a YA book? Beacuse I can tell you, as a mom - I would NEVER let my YA read it. Too much violence, drinking, and sex. And yes, I went to college and know these things happen. And no, I'm not a prude. Regardless of the lesson that will be taught (I'm only halfway through but I am pretty sure Abby will get pregnant and will have to make some sort of decision about it) I still didn't think extolling the virtues of sex without condoms (Travis does it, you must admit) is the greatest message you want to send. (edit: I skipped to the end. Relieved she's not pregnant.)  I can get past that though, because even as an adult I often enjoy YA lit, and who doesn't like a good love story? However, I found the characters to be way too one-dimensional for my liking. The themes were cliched (tragic past, runs away, repeats cycle) and the characters pretty cliche, too. Sure, romance is all good and fun and there's a certain amount of suspension of disbelief that these things *really* happen, but Parker and his perfect rich boy routine just was too much. Abby's inability to make a decision, her constant push/pull with Travis, Travis' wwwwaaay over the top over-protectiveness of her that borders on psychotic, just all too much. People are layered and nuanced and your characters should be too. Even in YA fic. I'm halfway through the book and I still don't really know what it is that Abby is running from or what scares her. Some kind of rushed \\"oh my dad is a drunk and he was mean!\\" just doesn't explain her current situation. (edit: I skipped to the end and see this was touched on somewhat).    The second thing that bothered me - the names.They're ridiculous. Stick with one non traditional name, but America, Shepley, Brazil, Finch? Please, I could have read this on fictionpress. Part II of my issue with names: Pigeon. Why the hell does he call her that? It makes no sense and was never explained, as was his instant \\"I have to be your friend!!\\" thing with her.   Part III of the names issue: It is not necessary to end EVERY SENTENCE OF DIALOGUE with the name of the person to whom the speaker is talking. Please assume your audience has the combined IQ of a squirrel and can follow. No one does that in real life. Travis' incessant use of \\"Pidge\\" after EVERYTHING he said honestly made me want to heave. Parker calling her \\"Abs\\" after like one date, \\"America\\" shortened to \\"Mare\\" just not good. I could have overlooked it if I wasn't forced to read them in just about every sentence of dialouge.   Overall, it just really needs some work. Delve more deeply into Abby's character, give Travis something deeper to go on other than violence and sex, drinking and overprotective jealousy. Why do they even like each other? Because I don't particularly like either one.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol Flynn remains a stalwart friend to boys nearly 80 years after making this movie.  My son (who is 8) and his friends have watched it all the way through three times and gone out to run the scenes with their pretend bows and arrows afterwards each time.  Also, getting to watch it with his grandfather, who remembers it as one of the first movies he ever saw, was truly delightful for my son.  I'm so glad it's available in this format.  I hope Amazon will be able to sell it directly themselves, because we had some trouble with the seller, but remain delighted with our purchase.

0439023483|5.0|In the book The Hunger Games, is about a young girl named Katniss or Kat some people called her. She grew up in a world run by a place called The Capitol. In the country it is split up into 12 Districts and Kat lives in the last one, District 12. All she has ever known is life in District 12, till one day she volunteers herself for The Games. There on out, her life is on the line, the question is, will she survive or will she meet death before she comes back home?<br /><br />I simple LOVED this book. It ends with a cliffhanger and that is why so many others end up reading the sequel, Catching Fire, of the book series.<br /><br />I simple loved the dynamic Katniss has with the characters throughout the book. Her true colors and humanity shows when she is hanging around the character Rue and Peeta. What surprised me was the love-triangle. Susan Collins woven this story arc so perfectly and leaves you wondering who she will choose in the end.<br /><br />What kept me reading the book was that some parts I could relate to Katniss in some ways, which I'e always found to be what a good writer has in making their books so popular (i.e. - J.K. Rowling and Stephanie Meyers).<br /><br />I would recommend this book to both genders of reading. The women will love this book for the powerful image Katniss represents and the love triangles. For the men, it is the action and suspense that keeps you reading it till the end.<br /><br />What truly struck me was thatStephen King himself loved this book! That right there is compelling enough to make anyone wonder, \\"why?\\" and set forth a reading journey.<br /><br />in conclusion, the book overall was amazing. Susan Collins has written a world of fantasy that is beautifully stunning.<br /><br />[..]
B004MARLJ2|3.0|This is a great game, and I really enjoyed playing it.  It's actually quite challenging, especially in the later levels, and you really need to think about your moves.  Also, the graphics look great on my EVO 3D.<br /><br />My only gripe with the game is that it's way to short for a game that costs $1.99.  If this was $.99 I would give it 4 stars, and if it was free I would give it 5 stars.  Again, a great game that is a lot of fun and quite challenging, but is just way to short.  Just as I was really getting into it, the game was over.  There is a duel mode, where you can play against a friend by passing the phone back and forth, but that doesn't add a lot of replay.  What would really be awesome would be if you could play online opponents, but unfortunately you can't.  I hope they update this game with more levels and possibly add an online duel, then it would totally be worth the $1.99.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|For those in love with Jane Austen's books, this movie may or may not be for you. I, myself LOVE Austen's books and the many movies that have been made.  I actually enjoyed this movie, because it was not another person's rendition of the Austen's classic, it was an original comedic change from the normal Austen. A modern day girl sent through time...but sent inside of a novel! What I enjoyed most was the continuous unexpected moments and humor. See what would happen if the characters switched partners, or someones real character were made known! Some areas that weren't in the book are in here. Some areas from the book are in here. The ending is a bit different than most would expect, nonetheless, I think it was cleverly done, indeed.
1591396190|5.0|As a business consultant and trainer I have made Blue Ocean required reading for my students and clients.  I am also using it as a model for my own business - so I am practicing what I preach.  The Blue Ocean principles are essential to any organization.  Beyond the organization they also have value to individuals especially those looking to make a difference.  Highly recommended.
0061733199|4.0|Great book on the SAS survival techniques. If you read other survival books, this one will have the same information. However, this is better written and the drawings are a little more informational. Has several climates shown and updates a few older items, like the solar still. Real world, solar stills are not going to do much, so find a better way if you can. Book is a good one to have on your shelf and read from time to time. Larger size will probably not fit in the survival kit, unless you carry a larger one. Recommended to my friends and to you all.
0385534639|5.0|It left me breathless with every page.    This book is truely a gift to us all.  Thank you Ms. Morgenstern!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Very nice pocket sharpener. Has a rod for serrated blades too. This unit only get marked down for the plastic construction that has cracked on mine. Twisting motion has made it loose, but it still works. Get these and stash in your kit with your knives. All metal versions are better, but this is good for the price. Larger blades will wear these out quickly, but they are cheap so get several.
B005B7IPG8|3.0|This film was very watchable but, as with so many films these days, it just ends without any resolution to the story. The acting was excellent, especially by the woman who played Mary. However, the message is skewed. I see it as a form of 'singles-bashing.' The married couple Tom and Gerri are portrayed as happy and mature while all the single characters are lonely, depressed, alcoholic, neurotic and pathetic. Even the son Joe, before he brings home the serious love interest, is labeled a 'dark horse' but once he brings home Katie, he is redeemed and \\"normal.\\" I find such caricatures of single individuals, and married couples for that matter, very off-putting. Surely one can lead a fulfilling life as a single and be miserably married. But this film suggests otherwise. The ending was very disappointing. It's as if the director had no idea how to end the film. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends for that reason. It's interesting to watch but leaves you completely let down in the end.
0553801473|2.0|I'll keep this short, as the top-rated 2 star review perfectly summarizes my thoughts on this book. This book was a depressing read. There was no energy, no sense of momentum and intrigue that carried books 1-3. Even though all our \\"favorite\\" POVs are back, they seem inexplicably boring, almost as if the author has no idea what direction these characters should go. In the end, George tries to tie things up with more cliffhangers and tacked-on suspense, but tat that point the damage is done.<br /><br />I award this book 2 stars, and GRR is no longer on my \\"must buy\\" list. In my mind, perhaps the series is best left at book 3...if the last 2 have been any indication, I don't want to stick around to see how things unfold.
B005KAH7QU|1.0|Not a small wonder this movie is in video already. Its a sad state of affairs when a movie this bad even makes to the theaters and so many people liked it; are they getting paid to write these reviews. There were some magical scenes like when she is in a hole and Hummvees are passing over at 60 mph then the next scene she holding on to the bottom of it magically. That was a ripoff.
0316098329|3.0|The idea is a great one, but the book just didn't deliver like I had hoped.  The first half was a bit slow, and then the book went too fast, if that makes sense.  But, it was a page turner.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|It's good, but for some reason, it now keeps 'finishing the current word' when I hit space bar instead of inserting a prediction as I've set it. Pretty much ruins the whole concept. It won't even autocapitalize my I's. Last time this happened I uninstalled/reinstalled, and it worked for about a day. Not pleased.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|I love hearing Stevie Wonder play with such a big  band.  3 keyboardists, 3  percussionists,  4 backup singers,  2 guitarists ,  trumpet, sax  and bass.  The energy is fantastic  and Stevie sounds as good as ever.  If I had one complaint it would be that he does a lot of audience participation  stuff  which  is great if you're at the concert,  but not as good if you watch it on DVD several times.
B0054N73EY|5.0|If you liked RHCP's last 3 albums, then you will like this one as well.  If you loved them then you will love this one.  I think that you could take any one of these songs off and put it on any of the previous albums and it wouldn't seem out of place.
0451216725|3.0|I've read Pillars of the Earth and found it fascinating.  But to compare this book to that is unfair.  Code to Zero was a fun read. Doesn't have the sophistication or depth of Pillars but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  Was it a bit predictable?  Yes but still, a worthwhile summer read on the beach
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Did you ever know a girl who had an a--h-le for an boyfriend.  Every other week he makes her cry and every other week they break-up. You say to yourself, \\"Man she is so smart and pretty she can do better than that guy. I wonder what she see's in him.\\" We've all met at least one Abby and Travis in our life. Well then again maybe not, because Travis' character was maybe a little too extreme, neurotic, impulsive, and a quick tempered alpha male. Abby was stubborn and always in denial.    As a reader, I knew their relationship was so dysfunctional but I couldn't stop reading. I couldn't turn away.  Love the story. the characters were beautifully chrafted & flawed.  This was a great story but contained errors. Overall well done.   Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes. It's a mesmerizing train wreck. This is definitely one of my favorite books for the year.

B002ZG9774|5.0|This is one of the best musical movies of all time!  We all know Christina Aguilera... she is the VOICE! She can sing dance songs (Genie In A Bottle, Come On Over Baby), hip-hop (Can't Hold Us Down, Dirrty), ballad (Beautiful, The Voice Within), acoustic (Save Me From Myself), rap (Woohoo), electronica (Keeps Gettin' Better, Genie 2.0, Bionic), blues and jazz (Back To Basics, Burlesque), rock (Fighter)... almost all types of songs!   This is a great movie for Christina fans, Cher fans, musicals fans, and movie fans in general... and the soundtrack is just awesome (Express, But I Am A Good Girl, Bound To You)!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|The Star Wars Saga on Blu Ray is fine compilation of all six Star Wars movies as well as an extensive collection of behind-the-scenes extras, documentaries and interviews. I am happy with the picture quality of each movie, but totally blown away by the audio mix. These movies have never sounded better. The picture quality varies from movie to movie, but overall I am impressed with just how good the entire series looks.<br /><br />I did notice a few color and picture anomalies that had been mentioned by other reviewers, but with a couple of minor adjustments to my Panasonic plasma display, I was able to fix these issues (the teal tint in Episode II and the muted star fields in parts of Episode IV) by simply changing the Color Management setting from \\"Warm\\" to \\"Normal\\" and the Picture Settings from \\"Dynamic\\" to \\"Cinema.\\" After doing that, this set as well as other Blu Ray titles I have look much, much more detailed and stunning. I'm a little confused as to why some details and effects were tweaked for this release, but others were ignored, like the color of Luke's lightsaber in Episode IV, as well as the lightsaber jump-cuts that occur when he turns it on and off. I am happy to see that the \\"Emperor's Slugs\\" were cleaned up in Episode VI, but don't quite get why some of the matte-lines in the same movie remain visible, but none of these details are that galaxy-shattering to me personally.<br /><br />The extras, including the deleted scenes, new and archival interviews, model and prop displays, are very interesting and informative, and the 2nd commentary track made up of archival interviews is even more interesting than the 1st previously released commentary. I haven't listened to all of the commentaries through each movie yet, but they clearly spent some time and effort to make sure the archival commentary matched up as closely as possible to the scenes. And I am still, piece by piece, making my way through all of the locations, shorter video commentaries and conceptart included on discs 7 and 8. There are quite a few bits of information about the making of these movies that I never even knew before, and I've been a Star Wars fan since I was 12 years old back in 1977.<br /><br />I do wish that the excellent documentary \\"Empire of Dreams\\" and the Prequel documentaries \\"The Beginning,\\" \\"From Puppets to Pixels\\" and \\"Within a Minute\\" had been included, but I already have those on DVD, so with those and the new extra material in the Blu Ray set, I feel like I have the most complete Star Wars home video collection I want.<br /><br />While I don't really care that much about seeing the original trilogy as each film appeared in 1977, '80 and '83, I do think it is a missed opportunity that those earlier cuts were not included here. It would have been very interesting to be able to compare, scene by scene, exactly what was changed and why, by offering the original cuts via seamless branching, as with the Alien, Bladerunner and Apocalypse Now Blu Rays, or at least have some sort of pop-up setting that compares original scenes with newer ones, but no such thing is included here.<br /><br />The only part of this set I really do not like is the \\"Spoofs\\" section, which for me wore thin after only a few minutes and doesn't even include some of the best early Star Wars spoofs like \\"Hardware Wars\\" from the late '70's or Carrie Fisher's hilarious 1978 SNL appearance. Also, while the packaging of the discs is ok, the artwork on this set is truly strange, even amateurish. I'm not sure what they were thinking when this art was chosen for the first-ever release of all six Star Wars Episodes together. Why not use some of Ralph McQuarrie's or Doug Chiang's concept art, keeping with the theme of the retro-documentaries included on disc 9?<br /><br />I have yet to watch the \\"Star Warriors\\" documentary, so I'll post thoughts about that some other time.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a fine Blu Ray set of all six Star Wars movies, and there is a ton of material included for the price. Although some of the additions or \\"Special Edition\\" changes to the movies have proven to be controversial to many fans, they really just don't bother me that much.<br /><br />Finally, I managed to find time to view the entire Star Wars Saga from start to finish in number order, from The Phantom Menace to Return of the Jedi, to see how it all works out as one epic chronological story. I found myself deeply involved in the story and characters in ways I hadn't anticipated. I saw and heard character and plot twists and development in an entirely new and refreshing light. When it was all said and done, my least favorite Episodes were I and VI, but they do make solid bookends to the entire story, which is still full of life and imagination to this now 40-something viewer.
B004EPZ09S|3.0|Contagion is about a group of people who must deal with the spread and containment of a highly contagious disease. Based on that statement you could probably guess what might happen. Sick people, a search for the cure, and widespread panic. Contagion is exactly what you think it is. Not to say that's bad, but I was not surprised by anything I saw.    The disease starts in Hong Kong, from there it is carried by Gwyneth Paltrow back to the states where she and her son die within a day or so. Her husband Matt Damon, immune to the disease, is left to take care of himself and his daughter.    Meanwhile Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard, and a few other major players are notified of numerous deaths happening around the world. The disease is spreading quickly, and the Center for Disease Control must find a vaccination and keep the public calm.    Jude Law a conspiracy blogger/journalist broke the story first. He questions if the CDC is really trying to help. He finds a medicine that he believes cures the disease, and spreads the word. As millions become affected chaos breaks out, road blocks are set up, and the people go nuts.    Soderbergh directed an all star cast. Scott Burns wrote a fairly smart script. The movie was well put together and entertaining enough, but nothing more than you'd expect. I wish Soderbergh would have gotten a little more experimental, maybe tinted the movie red or something like he did with Traffic. It seems like disease outbreak movies can go in one of two directions. An epidemic occurs and everyone turns into flesh eating zombies Aka 28 days later & I am Legend. Or an epidemic probably stemming from an animal becomes widespread, and the government works to contain the disease and the world seemingly goes insane Aka Outbreak.    I honestly felt like Contagion was too predictable and brought in tons of characters the movie couldn't devote enough time to explore. John Hawkes who I loved in Winter's Bone, plays a Janitor who showsup only once in each act of the movie, his character seemed compelling, but was pretty much wasted. The movie somewhat explored the idea that the government and CDC took care of their own before the average person. Hawkes character could have been used to show the struggles and desperation of a lower income individual taking care of his family during this epidemic.    Winslet and Cotillard were intriguing as well, but are never really explored. They came and went without us really knowing anything about them. I completely forgot about Cotillard until they mildly tie up her story near the end. I think this movie could have benefited from chopping off some of the extra meat. There were probably 7 or 8 main characters introduced, and only 2 or 3 were given the proper time to develop. Contagion tried to be this massive story about all these different people, but it just couldn't be done in 100 minutes.    For this movie to work, they were really gonna have to get us involved with these characters. So when they cry, we cry. When they are angry, we get angry, and so on. They basically just dumped on Matt Damon's character the whole movie, and by the end, sure I felt bad for him, but I wasn't really upset. His wife was cheating on him, he couldn't give his family a proper funeral, and he was stuck inside with no food protecting his daughter for months. I was more like, \\"jesus christ\\" cut this guy a break. You waited for some kind of reprieve, but what they gave him was pretty unsatisfying.    On the positive side, I always say if I can finish a movie in one sitting it was pretty good. And like I said the cast was impressive. Matt Damon is a great actor and he did what he could with the wiggle room he was given. He had two key emotional scenes, hearing his wife has died and dealing with it at the end, both were good. Jude Law probably had the best overall part. They flipped him around so rapidly, you're never really sure of his motives. He was probably my favorite character.    I really did like contagion, it just didn't add anything to the genre. If you're going to make a movie on a topic that's already been explored, you have to find a unique way to tell the story. This movie just rang repetition in my ears, and it'll quickly be forgotten.  (...)
B0034G4ORM|3.0|Pretty cool special effects and action scenes. Some of them are just too long though. It would have been better if the director left about 1/2hour in the cutting room...including the scenes about the civilian family.
030745455X|5.0|The second installment of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series is a quick, exciting read. It took the story developed in the first book into a lot of unexpected places and I couldn't help but stay up late a few times to get to the end. I highly recommend reading it, especially if you read the first one and couldn't decide if you wanted to move on in the series.
B0055SJVPW|1.0|This is the best movie for shallow, self centered, selfish people.  For the love of God, why in the world was this film ever made?  Absolutely horrendous!!!  Two best friends getting into an ugly cheating situation...what a plot!  Disgusting! What a waste of time!
031603441X|4.0|Book was in great condition the only thing I was disappointed in was the time it took to get from NJ to CT. Well over a week missed reading on trip that's why I went with the closest supplier. Learn something new everyday.
B004EPZ00W|5.0|WOW...What a movie!  Brad Pitt and Jonah hill are amazing!  The soundrack, direction, everything!  Oscar worthy for sure.  Go watch it!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I love all Lady Antebellum's song. The new title Own the Night CD is awesome. Just a kiss is such a pretty song. Watching them perform it live and the video is unbelieveable!!  It is like you can feel every emotion they are saying. So emotional! All  the songs tell a wonderful story. You will be  happy with this CD.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|This is a well crafted and entertaining movie. Great for adults and kids alike. If you were lucky enough to grow up with an older Norwegian adult who recanted the stories of the Trolls this movie will bring back fond memories of your past.
0553801473|4.0|I don't know about anybody else but I'm NOT in a big hurry to get this series \\"done with\\"... the stories continue, and continue and continue... which is a GOOD thing. Anybody with a decent attention span, which you must have in order to enjoy these books, ought to be able to tolerate living with the characters for a while. Isn't that the whole point? I suppose a few story lines could be at some point considered a bit ponderous, but I don't care. I'd read it again right now if I hadn't already promised to lend it to two other people... For a little context, before starting this book I re-read the entire series... and enjoyed it much more the second time! It was nice that the story-lines not showing up in the previous book were continued in this one, which overlaps it, time-wise. I tried really hard to wait for the paperback to come out... but in the end I caved and bought the hardback...which weighs a ton. You could seriously hurt yourself with it. If you're wondering whether to buy this one after reading all the negative reviews... GET IT!!! Dance to your own drummer. Ignore those pesky cynics. Don't deny yourself the pleasure..... it goes on and on,...
1612680003|5.0|I got this book for my husband for his birthday!  It's a great read for any parent, instilling how to manage money at a young age is very important especially how things are going right now.  My son will be reading financial books within the next few years to be ahead of the game.
B0050PYNO4|4.0|Clive and Graeme are just two Brits attending the San Diego Comi-Con, living their childhood dream by touring the southwestern U.S. in search of alien hotspots.  Little do they know that their trip is about to become a whole lot more dangerous...when they run into an actual alien, a smart-mouthed runaway named Paul.  He's trying to escape \\"the big man\\" and reunite with his species...and he's bringing his two new-found friends along for the ride.<br /><br />There's nothing about PAUL that is entirely new or original, which actually works in the film's favor; fans of the genre can simply watch it and enjoy, and newcomers have enough to keep them interested.  The acting is top-notch; Simon Pegg and Nick Frost still have great chemistry; this is their film, no doubt.  Seth Rogen's Paul is believable and entertaining; I'm not a huge Rogen fan, but he certainly know show to deliver a good line.  Kristen Wigg, as a devout Christian \\"born again\\" under Paul's tutelage, is amusing; Bill Heder and Joe Lo Truglio are great as a pair of Men in Black, with Jason Bateman being a standout as their superior.  The film also features a few great minor roles for John Caroll Lynch, Jane Lynch, David Koechner, Jesse Plemons, Steven Spielberg (yep), Blythe Danner, and an actress I won't name, though if you're familiar with her you'll identify her pretty early on (her entrance is still bada** though).  The script is solid (there are a lot of references to previous sci-fi films, some subtle, some not), and Greg Mottola's direction was, as usual, confident and sure.  If PAUL has any strikes against it, it's that the film is a bit too polished; it could afford to be rougher around its edges, given its R-rated (though not over-the-top) material.  Still, the film is enjoyable and entertaining, and is certainly a worthy entry in Pegg and Frost's canon.

B0042RJWTC|1.0|This is a great series, but very disappointingly, TWO of the discs were faulty. One disc was completely blanc (checked in computer and several DVD players) and another disc continuously skipped and froze (also checked in multiple devices). Now this is a 40 hour series, so not surprisingly it took us a few weeks to watch - by the end of which we were outside the time window for return. Reading through the reviews, I see several other customers had the same problems............
0688014291|1.0|The book's tone is rude and I don't see how the tone could be in the least bit effective.  Some of the techniques used are also used in dog training.  A real disappointment.  With books like this, it further weakens the already faltering leadership we see in corporate America today.  Don't bother to read this book or better yet, if you want to train people like you train dogs, just pick up a dog training book.
B0002EXH40|5.0|This CD was released before David Ellefson and Dave Mustaine asked Jesus into their hearts, so you can expect some less than Christian lyrics, but the album has some of the best musicianship I've heard in a long time. Bottom line is it's fun to kick back and crank.

0062060554|1.0|I was looking forward to this book based on some early reviews. However I concur with many others that this was a boring and redundant book. I too skipped over paragraghs without missing a thing. The ending was very predictable. Overall very disappointed.

0439813786|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book to my 8 year old boy.  We watched the silent movies referenced in the book on youtube and had long discussions on what the world was like during this time period (we even watched a few other silent films that we found quite funny).  The format of this book is great with the black border on the pages and pages and pages of illustrations.  If you like classics like the original Wizard of Oz and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory then you will like this book.  My son requested reading it everyday until we finished.
B00122Z9DS|3.0|I've thought a lot about what I find so vexing about this album.  It took me a long time to get into, and it occurred to me that with each new Rush release, fans are often stymied as they try to figure what Rush is this time around.  With ever-expanding gaps of time between albums, their styles and influences and studio habits evolve from album to album, sometimes producing a jarringly different experience from one to the next. While I think Vapor Trails is far superior in terms of songwriting and structure, this album has a lush, spread out feeling you might expect from these aging gents.  Old(er) age certainly doesn't preclude them from rocking out, but it leads to some overall changes in intensity and sonic fulfillment that are unique to the field, since there are so few relevant bands who have stayed together this long who aren't merely living off their back catalog.  Other reviews have pointed to this albums lack of direction and cohesiveness, and I agree.  It also suffers from something that Geddy pointed out in an interview about the making of S&A: That sometimes the words and music match up better than other times.  Never was this more evident than in their \\"dark\\" period of output from '89 to '96.  This is era I basically stopped buying and listening to them, not because I had some philosophical disagreement with the direction they were headed - it was just because the songs were so weak and often embarrassingly mismatched when it came to lyrics/music.  Neil went through a real dry spell in terms of weighty and significant lyrics, and they often seemed wedged together with random music that was not supportive or inviting to the words.  This is also a feeling I get from a few of these S&A songs.  But overall, the lyrics are better here and Geddy does a good job in adding some interesting sing-along choruses to them.  I've always felt that Alex was the weakest member compositionally (though his technique and fx are masterful).  I have a weird measure of the guitar solos in that if I notice the obvious \\"here's where the guitar solo starts\\", then it's less successful than the flawless integration of masterpieces like Red Barchetta's or LVS.  They sneak up on you and really build the song into something else, taking it to a higher plane.  Most of the solos on S&A are sadly not in this category.  They are nice, and well played, but feel tacked-on and out of place.  The overall ambiance of the production is full and lush, almost orchestral.  They seem to be more comfortable adding in overdubs of multi-guitars and vocals, while fully realizing they cannot fully reproduce them in a live performance - and that's okay.  But there's - dare I say it - a sort of \\"easy listening\\" quality to the whole thing that's both calming and frustrating.  The chops are still there, the themes are pure Rush, but the sound is layered and full, almost to the point that I feel it's used to cover for some weakness in the material.  Anyway, just some thoughts from someone whose opinion matters in the least.  It's hard to complain about a band that started about 3 epochs ago in terms of the corpulent music biz and is still producing vital and interesting music, even if it's not their best.
159514188X|1.0|**Spoiler Alert** I found this book to be disappointing. The only feeling I had for Hannah Baker (the dead girl), was irritation. I understand that none of the events were really her fault, however, unneeded blame was placed on many of the characters. The guidance councilor, for instance... how should he have reacted? You have two options, 1) press charges, 2) get over it. I don't think killing yourself and leaving a treasure hunt for the people you'd like to blame for your inability to cope is really a reasonable reaction. It's been quite a few years since I've been in high school, so maybe I don't \\"get\\" it. I have been through worse experiences than what this girl was subjected to in the book, and I'm fine. I think a lot of people can say that. Furthermore, I find this book to be dangerous, in that it's marketed to teenagers who may be feeling depressed and going though tough things at school. This book almost makes it seem like the girls reaction was an effective means of dealing with her pain... of making other understand what she went though. This book is the epitome of the why me generation. Bottom line: I read this on a road trip and sold it for $1.75 in a used bookstore when I got to my destination. I didn't even want to ride home with it.
0962929875|1.0|86.35 for a bi lingual book?! Are you kidding me?! F that.<br />The most I would pay is 3 dollars. Someone is on crack if you ask me.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|This could have been a really good book.  The plot is unique, interesting and not at all predictable. The character development is great.  But, I have a big problem with the unneeded and graphic sexual content.  I had a difficult time finishing  the first book.  Incest, pedophile (grown man with pre-teen girl) and lots of graphic rape  are not entertaining for me.  I bought the 4 books set and decided  to throw them away after reading just the first book. It felt dirty to have them around my house.
B004EPZ070|4.0|I didn't even know what this movie was about when I started watching it, so I had no expectations. As the movie went along, I when through 4 phases: 1) felt kind of conflicted about whether I should root for the main character and the fiance to be togehter, 2) felt even more conflicted about it, 3) was positive what they were doing was definitely wrong, and the main character should be ashamed of herself even though I kind of sympathized with her, and 4) somehow wanted them together in the end.  My sister, who read the book, tells me the book goes into more detail about the best friend's character and makes it so you cheer for the main character and want the best friend to end up losing. I'll probably try reading the book so I get the full picture of all the characters.  In the end I did end up liking the movie. Got some good laughs from me, and I felt happy for the characters in the end. I'll probably end up buying this moving because I find myself wanting to watch it again, and that says a lot for me.

B004PVKFR8|5.0|What a nice surprise. Very nice beats, memorable melodies and harmonies, varied enough to hold my jaded attention. Singable choruses and VERSES. How refreshing! I prefer the slightly rougher edges here. It's fresh. I think I'm in love with a whole \\"album\\". I haven't enjoyed anything this much since oh, about 1977.
1401309666|5.0|I was concerned that now that the phrase has entered the lexicon, with its own page on Wikipedia, and a dedicated blog, that the arguments might be old news. They are not. I do recommend the new paperback edition. The additional material is substantial in length, and worthwhile. I am a Data Miner, and I believe that it should be required reading for both Data Miners and for management at the businesses that hire them.<br /><br />The basic premise is that internet marketing makes it possible to promote a wider diversity of content than a brick and mortar enterprise can afford to do. The classic example is Amazon.com, and Amazon quite consciously knows that they are different than retailers that came before them. Remarkably a big Barnes and Nobles location can stock more than 100,000 titles, but Amazon keeps millions of titles on hand, and all of those less popular titles make Amazon a lot of money.<br /><br />What is surprising is that even though many new readers, like myself, know the premise before page one, there is still a lot left to read about. Anderson makes a very careful job of it. His arguments were honed via live and web discussions over a long period of time. The second surprise is there is something of a cultural shift going on. Even in industries that would not seem to benefit from the same phenomena, The Long Tail appears. Blockbusters of every stripe still exist, but niche products are more and more of every company's revenue. This is why it is still an important book, and why this book is not just for internet retailers.<br /><br />I was on a project recently that involved products that were found, sold, and delivered electronically. Clearly, The Long Tail is especially salient in such a market. Even Amazon still has to physically deliver their products. I found it so critical to my thought process that I bought copies for key members of my client team, and gave my copy to a coworker. One of the points that Anderson brings home is that the factor preventing the niche choices from being overwhelming is effective filtering. Search engines, and their equivalents, are what make The Long Tail work. I read, and read again, the sections on this since one of the things that I do as a Data Miner is build recommendation models.<br /><br />If you are a Data Miner, and haven't heard Anderson's entire argument, you really need this book. If you are an analyst of any kind, I highly recommend. If you are a manager in an effected industry, and Anderson argues that it might well be present in all industries, then it should be on your reading list. Finally, if you are a consumer, perhaps with a technical bent, you will probably find it an enjoyable read. Highly recommended.m being overwhelming is effective filtering.

B0050CJNJ2|4.0|I love the new Lady A album!  I especially love the title track 'We Own The Night'!  There were only a few songs that I can't see as radio hits, but all in all it's a must buy!
B004KSQN7C|3.0|Now we all know Britney is not known for her voice or her deep lyrics. She is known for having fun. I picked up this album hoping that it would be something different like Blackout was. Unfortunately, I felt auto tuned to death with this album. It is not the worst album I have ever heard, but it is definitely not the greatest either. It took a team of more than two producers to make this album even listenable. Every other track has so much auto tuning in it that technically anyone could be \\"singing\\" on this record. The songs are catchy and stay in your head, but there is no real substance on this album. With tracks titled Till the World Ends, Gasoline, Hold It Against Me, and Big Fat Bass, the auto tuning just keeps moving right along. Big Fat Bass sounds like a Black Eyed Peas B side that did not quite make the cut onto one of their albums. Till the World Ends and Hold It Against Me have been played on the radio so much that I no longer listen to FM radio. I think there is better pop genre to check out other than Britney Spears. A few would be Colbie Callait, Katy Perry, Lady GaGa, Madonna, to name just a few to listen to instead. After giving this album a chance, I went and sold it. I would rather my money go toward genuine talent rather than the latest auto tuned robot.
B004SKQAJI|5.0|SOME YEARS AGO I WAS CHANNEL SURFING AND CAME ACROSS AN EARLY PROGRAM OF RIVERDANCE WITH MICHAEL FLATELY. WITHIN MINUTES I WAS HOOKED. SINCE THEN I HAVE BOUGHT A MUMBER OF HIS DVDS AND VCR TAPES. I AM AMAZED AT HIS DANCING, I LEARNED HE HOLDS THE WORLD RECORD FOR NUMBER OF TAPS PER SECOND. WHEN I HEARD HE WAS MAKING THIS NEWEST DVD I WAITED EAGERLY FOR QUITE A WHILE FOR IT. WHEN I SAW IT ON AMAZON I DID NOT HESITATE TO ORDER IT AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. THE DVD I ORDERED WAS CLEAR AND IN VERY GOOD CONDITION.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|I picked up this album a few months ago and it turned out to be better than I expected. I had heard a lot of the songs on her first album played a lot on the radio so I was weary ot picking up this one, but when I heard more of the songs, I was glad to have it. I have listened to the album a lot in my car when I have to make a long road trip so it has helped keep me awake at night when I had to drive for 3 hours. My favorite tracks are Bloody Mary, Government Hooker, and Fashion of His Love. What I really liked about the deluxe edition were the different extended mixes on the second cd. Born This Way with the western flavor is a unique way to tweak a song. It was also the dance mix of Fashionista that got me interested in that song. When I first heard it on the album, I did not give it a second thought, but it ended up becoming one of my favorites. This album is worth listening to especially compared to a lot of the pop music that is released these days.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Very easy to use.  I like that there's no desktop software required.  Bulk transfers were quick.  Well worth a few bucks.
1594744769|5.0|I thought the book was very interesting. I read it in approx. 24 hrs. The ending is good. Your not suppose to have a fair tail ending in every book you read. If there is a 2nd book I would read it also.

0307275639|5.0|I strongly recommend everyone that I know to read this book. While I had already believed in the things that Morrie preached before I had even picked up the book, I understand that others may not have the some philosophy in life. At times, his message and sayings may seem repetitive or odd, but to that, I'd say to read this book with an open mind. In a materialistic society such as ours, Tuesdays with Morrie expresses the importance and essence of being an human being.  I admit, though, that I thought that Morrie was a very interesting figure, and the book was very short. But, I think that this reflects the quality of the book and its intention that we need to reflect on our lives and take it from there.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I've had this video almost a month and while I don't do it everyday I try to make time for it 2-3 days a week. It really kicks my butt, but in a good way! I've noticed a difference in my muscles already. Highly recommend.
B004LROMSO|1.0|Despite a great soundtrack, filming, costumes and locations this series is plagued by bad writing, cheesy acting, trashy love scenes, and weak story. I tried to figure out who will like this series. It could have been interesting, they certainly spent a lot of money on it.<br /><br />Maybe next time the producers should consider spending some money on writers who can actually write a screenplay and won't have to rely on sex to keep the viewers attention.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|You know, I kinda just finished the last twilight book like literally 2 weeks ago. The books were downloaded on my Kindle for the past 2 years and I just now finished the last one. Says something about the books doesn't it? I hate reading a series and finishing them, it just drives me insane. So I was bored one night and decided that I should just finish the series and put it on my \\"finished\\" list. I read the book in two days and those two days were the longest in my life and ones that I will NEVER get back! Instead of reading that mess, I would rather have just drunk bleach or gouged my eyes out. The whole series was a cruel joke that was played on us all. I cannot believe that these books are actually best selling, it's a joke!  I despised Bella in the whole series, there was nothing at all that I liked about her, Edward went from being a strong character to a whiny, mopey, punk B*tch. Jacob was an ok character until he started acting all jealous and stupid over a stupid plain girl with no dreams or goals, actually I take that back, her dream was to become a blood sucking monster. I really wish Victoria and her lackey just drained Bella. Bella made my skin crawl, she disgusted me with her Mary Sue attitude. I wish she would have died in NewMoon when she jumped off that cliff or when she gave birth to that thing she called a baby. She was a horrible hereoine, if you even call her that. And I am sure the movie will be just as terrrible as the book. I am just so happy this mess is over and there will be no more twilight.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I didn't know how lady antebellum's album could top their first 2 since they were so amazing, but Own the Night is by far their best work. Each song has such a story behind it and the melodies and tones of the song are so enjoyable. It's so easy to relate to their songs, whether it's based on personal experience or someone you know has gone through it. Their voices blend so well together and I can't get enough of this album. This album was well worth all the anticipation. I honestly can't even pick a favorite song because they are all so good! they really experimented well with new sounds and i love love love this album! BUY IT!!!!
0810993139|5.0|On the first day of school, Gregory Heffley gets a diary to write in. Now don't be fooled. He told his mom he DID NOT want a journal that said DIARY on it. But his mom got him this one. At first he didn't want to write in it but then he started writing in it. Soon he had a whole journal of words! Very funny and entertaining stories about Greg in middle school. I would recommend it to kids ages 7 and up.

B0029L7HQ8|5.0|The Tudors picks up the sexy, stylish side of the courts of Henry Tudor. Many other television shows have gave us long-winded, flowery speeches where the King would have been, in all truthfulness, already sleeping with his court ladies. I mean, after all, \\"It's good to be the King!\\". As a person with historical background, having done extensive research into the period, I can tell you that many of the events are not quite factually accurate. When you get into the flow of the programme, it won't matter a lick. King Henry's amazing attractiveness comes through with gusto in the eyes of Jonathan. He is a fantastic addition to the  grand reenactments of Henry. Giving justice to his grandiose legend. I recommend The Tudors with a full heartedness. Prepare to be sucked into the swirling colors and blood-soaked hands of history.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game, simple and challenging at the same time with an interesting soundtrack.  Easily worth the 99 cents for it

0439023521|5.0|I normally wouldn't have picked this book up but my daughter insisted it was good and that I would like it.  I am a really slow reader but couldn't put this book down and read it in no time. Seems that it would be an enjoyable book for youth also.  Violent idea but not graphic, romance but no sex, strong characters.  I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
0739384171|5.0|I am so hooked on The Girl Who... series by Stief Larson.  I read the first one, am now finished with this one and can't wait to read the last one.  The Girl who Stepped on the Hornet's Nest.  I'll be ordering that one today.  Lisbeth Salander is an awkward, unorthodox kind of herione, but you can't help but love her.  Audio books are great when you have a long commute as I do.  They not only help my drive go faster but they give me the opportunity to hear books, I wouldn't otherwise have time to read.  Great service from Amazon as well.
B004Q8FTE4|3.0|As much as I like Rog with Floyd, his solo stuff has always disappointed me. When I looked on my shelf I realized I have but one CD, \\"Amused\\", which was his \\"first\\" (non-LP) CD and I think I played it twice.<br /><br />The Pros And Cons Of Hitch-Hiking: concept album featuring one mostly boring two-sided song, freshly post-Floyd. I have the \\"no black band on the butt\\" LP in perfect condition, the best part of owning this one. \\"The Wall\\" was so great...this was a letdown.<br /><br />Radio Kaos: another bonehead concept LP about a crippled kid who blows up the world, or wants to, or something. Happy happy!<br /><br />Amused To Death: Rog shows Pink Floyd II how to make a Pink Floyd record. Has all the studio tricks and progger-isms but it's preachy beyond words. Rog sounds weary and lifeless, like your dad just had one too many and is telling you how awful the world is.<br /><br />In The Flesh, Live: Decent concert DVD, better than I expected, but I don't know why I'd want the CD. Next!<br /><br />Ca Ira: An opera? After those tepid solo albums? Why would I subject myself to that? Please.<br /><br />I never felt the urge to own CDs of LPs I don't often play. Too bad, I'd like to like his stuff.
B000001GPX|5.0|I picked up this CD on the Upper West Side for 4.50 from a street vendor who said, 'By the way this is the best recording ever of Beethoven's Fifth', and I was like, yeah dude whatever. I got it home and ripped it then synched it up to my phone without listening. I hit the streets and start listening and wonder what's wrong. First of all, everyone who says so is correct. It is clearly a superior performance of the symphony. You can recognize this within 30 seconds. What it took me a minute to figure out listening to the iPod that the dynamic range is a great deal broader than you ever hear with today's MP3s. The quiet passages are barely audible and the loud parts are earsplittingly jarring. You're going to enjoy this much more on a real stereo or with high quality noise cancelling headphones, because the dynamics are too deep for ordinary jogging
B004IFVBXS|5.0|Scream 1 is really the best of the entire series. It was fun to relive the frights before going to see Scream 4. The streaming option worked really well. $2 rental is also a great price!
B005KP7EK4|4.0|If you're a Western fan you'll like this film.  Despite the fact that it's shot almost entirely on location in Bolivia, it's a Western through-and-through.  What impressed us most was the cinematography.  It spans huge vistas and takes in almost alien landscapes that really dazzle the eye.  For this reason I highly suggest that you see this film on the Big Screen if it will be coming to a theater near you, but if that's not an option I will say that this film is best viewed on the largest screen you have access to.  The plot is reasonable and the story line makes sense, but both my wife and I thought that the film falls a bit flat at times.  It's a bit slow and friends have told me they thought so as well.  This was not a problem for me but my kids definitely need more action than this in a film and I wouldn't waste my time trying to get them to watch this.  They loved \\"3:10 to Yuma\\" for example, but this is not that kind of Hollywood film.  It's not a Hollywood film at all actually - it appears to be the production of Spanish film makers.  Authenticity and locations seemed to be excellent and the production values seemed to be first rate here.  This is NOT some sort of made-for-TV or direct-to-video film in my view.  The producers were reaching much higher than that and I think they did very well indeed.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|Don't buy this this!<br /><br />I thought I'd finally be able to enjoy the Kinect games in my library, but using the Zoom really makes no difference, in fact, it's worse!<br /><br />I was very careful to install it properly so all the lenses were flat, just like the blow-in sheet explained, but the sensor didn't magically make the Kinect work any better.<br /><br />The first time I tried it I put in a game I hadn't played for a while (alright, it was Kinectimals, don't laugh), and the usual thing happened - a white pop-up appeared telling me to download the latest patch for the game. The thing is, no amount of waving around would make the Kinect Zoom recognize me. I tried every possible lighting combination in the room, and it didn't even register a blip. Once I removed the Zoom from the lens, Kinect recognized me again and I was able to apply the patch.<br /><br />I also experienced the erratic hand effect people mention on here, but I noticed that occasionally even without the Zoom lens.<br /><br />The final straw was while streaming a movie, a phantom cursor (hand) would intermittently appear and move across the screen. Maybe it's just haunted because everyone was sitting dead still on the sofa! We tried to make the phantom hand appear, or control it when it did appear (unsuccessfully), with no luck. Maybe it had zoomed in so much it was getting a reflection of the film off our retinas! Anyway, it was quite distracting. I got up and clipped off the Zoom lens for the last time and the phantom hand never returned...

B005PDJBRU|5.0|The previous episode (The God Complex) dissapointed me a bit I must say with a lack of detail and subplots, but this one was a great mix of comical and dramatic, with some nods to classic Who (see if you can find the Patrick Troughton line...at least I think it is...  cybermats-cute but dangerous!) and rich and satisfying details as well as sadDoc and adorable baby. One of my favorite parts is when the Doctor is talking to himself while trying to head back to the TARDIS.
0553801473|2.0|I spent a few weeks re-reading books 1-4 and delayed purchasing Book 5 until I had done so.<br />A Dance with Dragons has some good points.<br /><br />*)Martins poorest prose is still better than much of the other offerings in this genre.<br /><br />*)I was able to read some of my formerly favourite POV's<br /><br />*)We learn a little bit more about Valyria and the doom that caused it's destruction.<br /><br />The main negative point I have to make is that there has been glacial (to be kind) movement in the plot.<br /><br />Other negatives include :<br /><br />*****Spoiler******<br /><br />*)What was the deal with Aegon springing forth with that extremely poorly constructed \\"revelation\\" scene ? I felt that there is more suspense and revelation in seeing if the leftover meatloaf will stretch to 3 helpings as opposed to 2.<br /><br />An extremely poor and blatantly transparent device to introduce at this juncture :'(<br /><br />*) Daenerys character devolution - Daenerys has possibly suffered the most cruelly in this book as the character that I was gaining much empathy and fondness for became reminiscent of Jordans Elayne Trakand and her endless procrastination. (at least there was no sniffing or braid pulling, although the \\"I am just a young girl .... \\" routine soon became quite tired)<br /><br />*)Urine Fetish - self explanatory, perhaps his own personal circumstances were brought into the book a little too much, although for a supposedly and reported ongoing piece of work that was years in the making surely we would have only had these references in the latter part of the book and not rife all the way through it?<br /><br />*)Meerenese Knot - Seriously ? This was the imponderable issue that caused so many sleepless nights and the author to start to suspect the permanent loss of his muse ? I perhaps find this the most difficult to swallow of all.<br /><br />*******End of Spoilers***************<br /><br />I have read a few other reviews where people postulated that Martin's editors advised him to hand over whatever he had and they would publish it as it was turning into a complete farce.<br /><br />I have read a few opinions that this is the HBO screenplay edition book (complete with Season finale cliffhangers) as a Feast will most possibly not be produced.<br /><br />I am not sure.<br /><br />As I have said I enjoyed aspects of this book but all in all it is a far cry from the tight dialogue and hurtling plot progression of his earlier works. I am all for character development but let it belong to meaningful characters or let it have something to do with the progression of the over arcing story lines.<br /><br />Many of you will have read Neil Gaimans article in Defence of George. He is correct, we pay over our money and we take our chances that the series will be finished. Gaiman did admonish George on his lack of professionalism when it cam to repeatedly ignoring deadlines but perhaps the HBO involvement will provide a spur to his creative juices.<br /><br />Will I read the next books ? Most likely, as I have invested quite an amount in this author.<br /><br />Time will tell.<br /><br />On a further note can I please entreat people to refrain from giving one star or five star reviews simply to stymy the stats ? If you genuinely believe it deserves a one or a five great, please expound on why you feel it does though.

B001SGEUNI|5.0|This is a really great album.  I never really got into this band until I was them live and they were freaking awesome; they stole the show from Bullet for my Valentine and Seether.  After a few listens, this has grown to be one of my favorite recently purchased albums.

B005KAH7QU|5.0|Well done with a good theme and cast great action with an interesting plot would like to see a second release
1423113454|5.0|I hate to say it but yes I find this book very enjoying and exciting. It's better than Percy Jackson and to think I gushed about that book in some reviews also. The mysticism and mythology mixed with raw humor will certainly leave you breathless after reading. I was enthralled by the Kane brothers. They are good examples of being brothers. Two thumbs up for this one. I hope I can read the next book sooner!
0670022411|2.0|After a LOT of novels that talk about vampires, this is one novel who included witches in the full book. I wonder if Stephanie Meyer and Deborah talked about their plots and characters because this book is just like Twilight saga in every way. The heroine is a stubborn lass who seeks danger for her own good while the hero is a hungry vampire trying to put down his bloodthirst for the girl. Classic eh?
B001F6TXME|5.0|This remote works great.  It is easy to push the button.  Pushing it down slightly will focus the camera, if it is on auto-focus.  Pushing it down all the way releases the shutter.  The lock for long exposure shots works nicely.  The cord is about 37 inches long.  I use my camera for product shots on a tripod and this is easily long enough to keep the camera still.  For more flexibility you could purchase the wireless remote.  Both products seem of good quality plastic.
B004PHE9F6|5.0|This is the first Blu-ray copy of an original 70mm film that I reviewed, and is at least one case where marketing hype couldn't oversell the image quality.  Sitting up close to a Samsung 52\\" LCD screen, the images are so lifelike, you forget you're watching a movie.  I love the Ferrari pit crew; they actually have real mechanic's grime under their fingernails, not the phony baloney Hollywood grime usually present.  Even after watching the movie repeatedly, and deliberately looking to find fault with the copy, there was little to pick at.  Only a few scenes show a hint of smear around moving objects, which are so prevalent in lesser productions.  The recording engineers went to great lengths to assure the correct engine recordings and shift points were laid down on the final sound track.  The results are amazing.  Close ups of the driver's feet during a ballet like heel-toe shift had my hair standing on end, and during the race scenes, I find myself leaning to counteract the cornering forces.  Like other reviewers have noted, it is interesting to watch extras in the background, now that they don't fade into anonymous blurs.  It is also very refreshing to have extended scenes of the race that allow the viewer to actually focus on the moment and ride with the various drivers, unlike the obnoxious one second scene changes prevalent in today's action movies.  If you are a race buff or a car guy, you'll fall in love with this film.  The cars being raced represent the pinnacle of human engineering, before mega F1 budgets and computer assisted designs besmirched the gorgeous body work with hundreds of sponsor's logos and turned a handmade work of art into a perfectly manufactured technology exhibit.  Be careful, watching this movie will impact the way you drive, especially in the rain!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simply put, this is a great game. The graphics and sound effects are excellent and the music fits very well.
0375703764|1.0|I tried to like this book.  I really did.  I didn't even mind the weird formatting.  What got me was the endless footnotes referring back to made-up sources, and the constant breaking into the story so an \\"expert\\" can explain what this character or that character meant by folding their arms at a certain time or refusing to be hugged.  Come on.  I enjoyed the parts of this book that were actual STORY.  I liked hearing about the house and the expeditions.  But I eventually had to skip everything else, and that includes the pointless outside narration by the tattoo artist.  I'm just sad I spent money on this book.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|Using a virtual pen that follows the touch strokes is a great idea but there should be an option to make the pen tip visible for better control. This app has potential for further development into the realm of handwriting recognition, handwriting analysis, graphics and cad apps for tablets. Keep up the good work and thanks Amazon!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|The author of this app seems to actually believe this ancient mythology and present it as such. This is extremely dangerous in this world of religious fanatics and terrorism. This app cannot be used as a proper, unbiased research tool into the beliefs of ancient, misguided Earth cultures. Not even worthy of 1 star.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I've been waiting for something like this to come along.  no need to grab a paper and pen, must jot it with your fingers. awesome app:)
B004XNGKBS|2.0|A finger is simply not precise enough to do much actual writing. If my phone had a stylus, this would probably be a great app, but it doesn't. I find I have to force myself to write uncomfortably narrow words for them to appear normally on the screen, and even then my handwriting is practically illegible. Perhaps it's simply a matter of getting used to writing with a finger, I'm not certain, but for right now, voice input is much faster for me.
B004SBULWE|5.0|App works pretty good on the Evo4G. I keep it on crazy kill every 30 minutes. It's kept me from having to charge my phone 3x a day.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game for family or gatherings with friends.  I started playing this game after being introduced to it at a labor day party with my in-laws.  I was skeptical at first, but the game is extremely entertaining and mixes strategy with the luck of the roll.  It is a combination of a Risk, and Civilizations game.  I highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a new way to bring people together for a good time.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've had these things for 5 years now and worn them full time as a programmer the entire time. I wore out the stock earcups fast, the replacements from sony didn't last longer. Got some beyerdynamic earcups that were comfortable for a couple years. I just picked up some memory foam earcups and I'm in love again.<br /><br />These headphones have taken a BEATING.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|First off let me say that this is the first series I have reviewed. I read a lot.. mostly romance novels. I have read many books, but only a few can come to mind that I loved. Some books just haunt you after your read them and let me tell you this is one of those series. I couldn't put the series down. My heart broke when Barrons and Mac would have a fight and my heart swelled when they would show those rare glimpses of how they really felt. These books took me on an adventure with every page! If I close my eyes I can still see the lighted streets of Dublin on a dark night and how BBB shined above and more than any other building. I can still see the nasty Unseelie, and Barron's dark un-human like gaze that sees all. I remembered when I finished this book I was almost heart broken for it to end. If you are hesitating about this series- don't. It is one of the best stories I have ever read in my life. I can already see myself wanting to read it over and over again, because I believe I will probably read things I didn't even notice before. Thank you, Ms. Moning, for creating a story that I could completely lose myself in and cherish.
B000001EUR|5.0|The Scorpions are the largest selling German band in rock history, this album is an exemplary reason why. Klaus Miene, Rudolf Schenker, Matthias Jabs, Francis Bucholz, and Herman Rarebell are legends of the metal genre. Originally forming in 1974 the band continued its Multi-Platinum success throughout the 1980's and up until their 2010 release, Sting In The Tail, which is also a must have. Bad Boys Running Wild starts out the CD, The Scorps clearly making a statement that they had finally arrived after mediocre success in the 70's. Rock You Like A Hurricane is still the most popular song in the Scorpions pantheon and their highest chart topper yet. I'm Leaving You is one of my favorites on the CD with good back up vocals by Rudolf Schenker. Coming Home encapsulates the legendary voice of Klaus Miene, he is one of a kind vocally in the rock world. Big City Nights was another Top Ten Single with memorable riffage. Still Loving You is by far the most successful ballad in the bands history and again has wonderfully written lyrics by Klaus. This Album is one of the Top Twenty Albums in Rock History without question, highly recommended!
B005MW68RK|5.0|I don't have anything else to say that any of the numerous five star reviews haven't already said. This album is inspired. If you love blues, Janis Joplin or good music--buy this immediately.
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden is one of the most successful and popular metal bands of the last 30 years. Bruce Dickinson, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, Steve Harris, and Nicko McBrain are all masters of their insturments and crafts. Murray and Smith represent one of the best metal duos in rock history, right up there with Tipton/Downning and Clark/Collen. Powerslave is the culmination of their efforts. Aces High sets the mood and pace of the CD. It is a fast and furious track with blistering lead work by Dave Murray. 2 Minutes To Midnight is the most successful track on the CD good bridge, solo, and leads, a very memorable track. It is amazing that Iron Maiden has been able to sell in excess of 80 million albums despite the fact that they have no \\"hits\\" and recieve almost no radio airplay. Losfer Words is a brillant insturmental with a driving drum beat from McBrian. The Duelists features an odd time signature and many changes in arrangement. Powerslave is another classic from the record, Dickinson singing at his best on the track. Rime Of The Ancient Mariner is the longest track at 13+ minutes and it is also my favorite track. The arrangement, brige and solo sections are truly virtuoistic. The track shows the endurance of the band and their obession with strange inspirations of song themes. The song is based on on a late 19th poem about a ancient sea captian that is looking for a mysteriuos Albatross. The album is probably the pinnicle of the Maiden catalogue, it is a MUST HAVE for any Metal fan.
B0054N73EY|5.0|While it is true that this new album does not contain the stand out guitar work of John Frusciante, it does have something else to offer.  It seems to focus more on grooves and melodies.  Honestly, I don't care for much of the 'Peppers' work before Californication, so I'm happy to say this album really has no rapping on it.  I found it relaxing, but still exciting to listen to.  The band seems to have matured over the last 5 years.  This is the first album I've heard of theirs that has no throw aways on it, like  Throw away your television, I like dirt, Hump de bump, etc.  I hope the band stays on this current path and I think Josh Klinghoffer could work out great.
B005PKLKS6|5.0|What else can you say? The best story on TV. How they keep ratcheting up the suspense is quite a talent. These actors demonstrate the art.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Best album by far from Lady Antebellum.  This CD is a completely different sound from Lady A's first two albums.  Although familiar sounding, this CD really brings a new, fresh sound to the group as well as highlighting Hillary and Dave a little more than the past albums.  Listen to the album in it's entirety.  With each song, you'll find a new favorite.  \\"As You Turn Away\\" should be their next Grammy!

B003UBTX6S|2.0|I had been pleasantly surprised reading the book.  It was so much more interesting and action packed than the first!!!  But then I got to the climax of the story, and got disappointed once more.  I've confirmed the authors definitely don't know how to write a climax in a story.<br /><br />I don't think I'll be reading the 3rd installment.  I am reading now Dream Dark, because I sort of like Link's character; but that will be it for my involvement in this series.
0671578855|3.0|Interesting and well-written book, with humor and wit.  I had not read any of the prior books in the series; hence, it took a few chapters to get aligned to the names and places in this SciFi novel; but, once I caught on, it moved quickly. A Good Read!
B0057GYOA4|5.0|Twenty years ago, rock was changed forever when a little called song 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' hit radios everything, eventually knocking the King of Pop off his throne and declaring rock n roll is king again. Nirvana was and still somewhat viewed as an overnight sensation, though not really the case, this album, Nevermind, changed rock forever.<br /><br />This Deluxe Edition of Nevermind is quite a comprehensive collection of songs from this era of the band. First off, the album sounds really great from remastering, not overdone, but given a breath of life in each song. It sounds fresh and crisp and even more powerful than before. For fans worried about whether or not 'Endless, Nameless', the famous hidden track on the original album is present, it is, only the dead-space silence is cut, which overall is good. Now for what's left..<br /><br />Basically, the rest of disc one after the orginal album is all the B-sides tracks from each of the four singles released from the album. Each B-side included live tracks which are included as well. So if you have the Singles Box Set, you already have all these. Though, they do sound better from the remastering. Disc two starts with the Smart Sessions, which are great to hear the band rehearsing such powerhouse songs like 'In Bloom'. If you already have With The Lights Out, you have the versions of 'Pay To Play', & 'Here She Comes Now'. To my ears, the version of Dive on hear is the same as the one on Insecticide. The next half the disc includes The Boombox Rehearsals and two tracks recorded at the BBC. If you have the With The Lights out set from 2004, you have the version of 'Teen Spirit' found on the Boombox Rehearsals. All of them sound rough around the edges, but it's a real treat to hear the early orgins of these soon-to-be classics. The last two tracks, BBC recordings, are great, particularly Something In The Way, performed electric, sounds absolutely amazing.<br /><br />If you sprung for the four-disc set, disc three is The Devonshire Mixes, which from what I've heard is the same as the Butch Vig mixes, which are nice if you're a big fan, but not really essential. Not too much of a difference, but it is noticeable. Polly is not included for some reason though. Disc four is the CD of Live at the Paramount from 10/31/91, and it is a great show. I can say thankfully, no added audience noise was added to the beginning of any of the tracks like on the Reading CD. The sound quality is excellent and is a great show of the era of the band.<br /><br />So, with that in mind, is it worth it? If you don't have either the Singles Box set or With the Lights Out, I'd say a must, not only for the tracks but for the remastering as well. If you have either/or, yes and no, depending on the level of a fan you are, and if you care about remastering or not. For the four-disc set, I'd say only for the most hard-core fans, you can buy the Paramount DVD separately or download the show or the Devonshire Mixes off Itunes or Amazon MP3. Overall, a great set to celebrate a milestone album in rock.rom what I've heard is the same as the Butch Vig mixes, which are nice if you're a big fan, but not really essential.

B005C5A6C0|5.0|Straight off the heels of arguably their best album and metal masterpiece, The Blackening, Unto The Locust does not dissapoint in the slightest in terms of Machine Head continuing to being the premier modern metal band. Prior to release, the band stated that this album would be a sort of combination of all their previous works, but at the same time a continuation of musicality for the band. This album certainly shows that and more, Beginning with the eerie chants that flow into the crushing breakdown of the intro, then only blowing everything away with the pure brutal thrash attack of I Am Hell. What a way to start off an album. Be Still and Know is good, a more modern styled chorus but overall great track. Locust most everyone knows by now, released as the first single months ago but it still kills and is sure to be a staple live. This is the End is pretty good, keeps the album flowing. Then there's Darkness Within, a true ballsy move for the band imo, but they pull it off with precise measure, really exposing their true roots and nature through this moving piece. 'Pearls Before..' picks up the metal again, another killer track. The album closer, Who We Are, begins with Rob's kids singing, which really wasn't needed IMO, but it's not very long, the track itself is great. The two bonus tracks on the deluxe version are Judas Priest's 'The Sentinel' and Rush's 'Witch Hunt'. Both are great covers, Machine Head always knows great songs to cover, though it wouldn't hurt to mix it up a bit, coming off as almost straight copies of the originals. The acoustic version of Darkness Within is a great bonus as well, shows Rob's skills as a guitarist and vocalist. Overall, this album is a great edition to Machine Head's canon, they are definitely still on the right track musically, they didn't intend to make 'The Blackening' twice, which is a good thing, but as a whole, it does fall just slightly below the Blackening, just because that album as a whole flowed with such precision and grace. Not to knock 'Unto the Locust' in any sense, the key tracks on this album show how Machine Head have grown as musicians and as a band. Take note newer metal bands, and even older ones caught in a rut, this is how it's done.and grace.

B004ZNARH4|3.0|To put it simply...the Wembley 74 show is fantastic (five stars for that!) The rest of the contents of the box is so so. I really do not understand the scarf and the marbles. The books are nice, as are the coasters. The other odd printed matter is just thrown in and does not bring much value to the release. I personally would have preferred more music content, a hardback book and less tchotchke. Stick with the Experience version and your wallet will be much happier.

B005EHNEDO|5.0|The Whole Love is in my opinion Wilco's best album since Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (that's not saying the other albums are bad, I love them too, but this is more suited to my taste). All of the bases are covered here, and the album represents Wilco's different sounds very well. Art of Almost and Capitol City represent Wilco's more experimental side. Tracks like I Might, Dawned on Me, and Born Alone are blissful moments of catchy hook-laden pop that was most prevalent on Summerteeth. There's also representation for their more country/folk influenced sound in songs such as Open Mind, Rising Red Lung, and Whole Love. Overall, I would recommend this album to any Wilco fan, and most likely anyone who is a fan of alternative music in general. Top work 9/10 (or 5 stars)
0547791097|5.0|This is an excellent contemporary noir novel in which a character becomes caught up by circumstances largely beyond his control and must then struggle to somehow survive.<br /><br />The main protagonist, Driver, is a stunt driver for the movies, and there's none better. But he also moonlights driving for robberies, and the thrill is principally in the driving itself rather than in the monetary rewards. He makes his position clear to anyone who wants to employ his services: \\"I drive. That's all I do. I don't sit in while you're planning the score or while you're running it down. You tell me where we start, where we're headed, where we'll be going afterwards, what time of day. I don't take part, I don't know anyone, I don't carry weapons. I drive.\\"<br /><br />Apart from his driving, Driver leads a minimalist existence, moving frequently, paying cash, leaving virtually no trail. But then, as must always happen in a book like this, things go wrong on a number of levels; Driver winds up alienating some very bad people and the game is on.<br /><br />This is a beautifuly written book, lean and taut without a single wasted word. One hopes that the release of the movie made from the book will finally garner for it and for James Sallis the wider attention that both he and this book certainly deserve.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|I must admit that my first encunter with Mad Men was not a good one.  I missed the entire first season and decided to try picking up with the first episode of the second season when it originally aired.  Big mistake!  Not only is that one of the weaker episodes of the second season (in my opinion) but attempting to jump on board with this series without having viewed any of the first is nearly impossible.  The characters created by Matthew Weiner and his creative team are remarkably layered and difficult to read and it is essential to start at the beginning in order to be able to more fully understand who these people are and what makes them tick.  So I recently went back to the very beginning and I was pleasantly surprised at just how engrossing, intelligent and shockingly moving it all turned out to be.  But you have to be patient.  Mad Men peels away the layers of its characters slowly and with precision never forcing the action along or making the characters do anything that feels unbeievable or forced.  The result is an admittedly slow pace, but after time it becomes almost hypnotic and the payoffs are huge.<br /><br />On the surface, Mad Men appears to be a highly stylized re-creation of the early 60's advertising business right down to the tiniest details.  But in reality, the show is all about what lies beneath that sleek surface and in Mad Men's case, that's a lot.  While the employees of the Sterling Cooper ad agency go about their daily routines (which include driniking and smoking in the workplace, treating the women in the office like objects and casually engaging in extramarital affairs), the entire cultural/social/poltical landscape is rapidly shifting.  The men and women of Mad Men are still clinging to the values and social conventions that were in place before the 60's tore the nation apart and redefined the roles of women and minorities and laid the groundwork for an entirely new national psyche.<br /><br />But Mad Men is also about the emotions, desires, wounds and other messy issues that the characters fight so desperately to avoid.  I think it's fair to say that part of the shows glacier pacing is a direct result of the strain on nearly every character to avoid dealing with things.  So a lot of time is spent watching the Mad Men and their wives/mistresses focus entirely on their work and the day to day routines that barely hold back the flood of emotions threatening to break free. It's a very accurate depiction of how people live their lives even today.  In the end, that is why Mad Men feels thouroughly contemporary and resonant.d other messy issues that the characters fight so desperately to avoid.

B005NA3B8U|5.0|R-Type is about shooting and maneuvering perfection. The game is hard until you master the immediate challenge. Then you move to the next one and it gets harder and the next victory tastes so much sweeter.<br /><br />Back in the 20th Century R-Type was one of the most popular arcade shooters and the Android port stays faithful to the original for the story line - fight the evil Bydo - the frantic pace and the (at least for me) extreme difficulty. The graphics on the XOOM are a little fuzzy but the game makes it up in spades with instant response to touch controls and the ability to display dozens of independently moving objects while only occasionally missing a frame or 2. So, here's my detailed review.<br /><br />THE FUN FACTOR<br /><br />This Android version should be 'instant recall' to anyone who played the game in an arcade or maybe on a Commodore 64 or TurboGrafx 16 back in the late 80's-early 90's. All the original eight levels are there, the ship, the weapons and the enemies very much like what I remember fighting way back then and the difficulty is maybe higher because the game seems to be moving at a slighter faster pace than I remember.<br /><br />So, to answer the 'fun' question: yes, it's 'fun' to play R-Type for as long as you accept that it's practically impossible to beat the game and you don't mind fighting the same fights over and over again until you achieve 'perfection' and move to defeat the next challenge.<br /><br />OPEN FEINT<br /><br />Open Feint is optional and it doesn't add a lot this R-Type but if you don't want to feel completely on your own or have friends playing the game it can add to the fun factor.<br /><br />CONTROLS AND GAMEPLAY<br /><br />Most thoughtful, you can select between right-handed and left handed configurations, and between 'full touch' where you set your ship's position by touching the screen anywhere and the 'arcade' touch mode where you use an on-screen D-Pad. The cannon and the force module controls are always virtual touch buttons and you see their outlines on the screen whenever they are usable.<br /><br />Other options include autofire on or off (if you want to make your game really hard).<br /><br />Off game, you can set the music and FX levels and you can access a pretty detailed help screen which explains the rules (you start with 4 lives, try to stay alive for as long as you can) and the several powerups.<br /><br />RATING<br /><br />I loved playing the game in arcades and an R-Type clone (Katakis?) on my Commodore 64 and either cost me a lot more than this port. This port is as hard and as much fun as the original. The touch controls are naturals and quickly become second nature while playing, the visuals and the pace are the same or better than I remember. It's a 5 stars because I love playing it.ble.  Other options include autofire on or off (if you want to make your game really hard).

0345479092|2.0|I'll be honest and admit that I only read the sleep section of this book. I read it twice through and honestly it's just not a method that I want to implement with my child. Also, it gives suggestions but no additional information if her suggestions don't work such as...\\"give the baby a 10 or 11 pm feeding so they'll continue sleeping\\" didn't work for me, my child still woke up at her normal times for feedings. Also the author suggests weaning them from that feeding and offering a pacifier and eventually weaning the pacifier. Well, didn't work once again and she didn't offer any suggestions on what to do if it doesn't work. As with any book you have to do what works for you and your baby and tweak the suggestions but I didn't find this book helpful in any way shape or form. Good luck!

B002ZG98FU|4.0|Morning Glory - speaking as one who carried Harrison Ford's Star War's card around in her wallet for several years, I have to say that I don't think he has aged as well as some other male stars.  Or maybe he was just too grumpy in this movie.  Anyway, Diane Keaton looked way better than he did.  This was your basic formula movie; you knew how it was going to end before it started (which is not always a bad thing).  Rachel McAdams plays a workaholic young producer who ends up working for a failing morning show and turns it around.  Oops is that a spoiler?  Only if you have been living under a rock for your entire life.  Anyway, Diane Keaton is the embittered existing host and McAdams brings in Harrison Ford to be the co-host, a job he considers way beneath him since he is a veteran hard news anchor.  Eventually she penetrates his crusty outer shell and wins both Diane Keaton and him over, learning to better balance her own work and personal lives at the same time.  Oops another spoiler?  See previous comment.  Formula aside, this comedy is executed particularly well and has some very good bits/running gags such as the one where they put the dorky weather man in to increasingly extreme situations in search of ratings - roller coaster, sky diving, tattoo, etc.  They do a similar bit with Diane Keaton which is equally funny, I also liked the bit with Harrison Ford at the end, but I won't say what that was because, duh, that would be a real spoiler.  Per grumpy Harrison Ford comment above, he didn't smile at all the entire movie (and I was watching) until the last five minutes.  I asked my friend if he had a stroke because his grimace was lop sided but she said that was acting.  I thought Diane Keaton did a good job in a thankless role and Rachel McAdams also did a good job and looked way less beautiful (and more human) that in a lot of these movies, which is a good thing (looking more like a real person you might meet and not a model) as far as I am concerned.  So all in all, it was an amusing way to pass the time,but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater.

B000002GYW|5.0|An immense one.  I was a teenager when I first heard this album around 1980.  Every bit of songwriting, every word, struck a chord with me.  Here I was, a hard rocker, smitten with a country-rock album like no other.  My favorite bands at the time were Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick, the Jam, UFO, Zeppelin, Journey, well...you get the picture.  I always knew about the Eagles because, well, who hadn't heard their single Take It Easy and thought it was the catchiest thing on the radio?  And then they released that monster of a song \\"Hotel California\\" which was equally catchy with the added bonus of cryptic lyics to boot and a really cool duel guitar solo by two well-known guys that played like no one else.  And of course all those great singles in-between.  But, nothing before or since, grabbed hold of me as this album did.  Me, a city kid, from the near west side of Chicago.  Was I turning country, or what? (Please, folks from rural areas and Nashville, no offense, I just wasn't raised in or by anyone or anything \\"country\\"). I ate this stuff for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It was the coolest thing I had ever heard and it rang true.  I never wanted to be a cowboy or live in the old west, but I did get a little excited by the prospect of holding something shiny and smooth in my hand (a guitar!  or looking really cool like those four talented musicians on the album cover.  No rock album ever spoke as truthfully to me as this one did about choosing a life apart from the rest.  Great music, great lyrics and a great story.  If you like classic rock, country rock, westerns, feeling cool, feeling introspective, feeling sentinmental, feeling wild...this album has it all.  Pick it up.

B001E45XT4|4.0|I must say I was impressed with the value this headset offers. It is probably one of the best deals out there. That being said if you are willing to spend another $25-50 you can get 10x the quality. As the price leader it has some nice features. Mic stores conveniently up out of the way, big plush ear protector, a really long cord. One annoying part for me was that my computer has a single jack for mic and sound, so i had to buy a USB adapter. I cannot test the sound quality accurately as it runs off the sound card on the USB adapter I  bought and not the sound card on my computer. The headset is not play for 8 hours comfortable, but I have played 2-4 hour sessions with little to no discomfort. Again discomfort depends on your head size and how sensitive your ears are so this is just my opinion and cannot be prescriptive for your experience.

B0040JHWKS|5.0|A brief background...<br />In 1975, Bruce Springsteen released his third record, Born To Run, catipulting him to a level of fame his first two albums had failed to do.  There was no specific single that ever became a \\"hit\\" in the eyes of radio, but the album as a whole was a hit, charting in the upper-reaches of the Billboard Top 200.  And while the first two albums were really good and (to some extent) still have not received the credit due to them, Born To Run would be the record that soldified Bruce's status as rock's singer-songwriter for the 1970s.  He was - excuse the cliche - a \\"songwriter's songwriter\\" who took some of his cues from Bob Dylan, but rocked hard in a way that Dylan never quite could, at least in-studio.<br /><br />Then, after the record-release and the subsequent Born To Run Tour, everything came to a halt with the legal garbage between Bruce and his former manager, Mike Appel.  When the suit was settled, there was an obligation, a promise Bruce needed to fulfill.  Not just a promise in-regards to fulfilling a contractual obligation for Columbia Records, but a promise, a commitment, to his fans to remain true to himself and his music, even if it meant that his next album wouldn't be a hit a la Born To Run.  Oh well, so be it.<br /><br />The journey that is The Promise...<br />Though 1978's Darkness On the Edge of Town (DOTEOT) would be the official follow-up to the Born To Run record, Bruce went through at least 70 songs before DOTEOT came to be.  The Promise, which is an apt title for this compilation of the \\"lost-sessions\\", is a document of the journey Bruce and the E Street Band went through to get to DOTEOT.<br /><br />Though many of these songs are in the classic, 50s-pop-by-way-of-the-1970s mold, these songs aren't merely happy songs.  Some are happy, some are sad/hopeless, and some are somewhere in-between.  Even when one listens to the happy songs, he doesn't have to listen too hard to realize he's dealing with people trying to sustainrelationships and trying to cut-lose and have fun, even though everything surrounding them (a less-than-perfect job, bad economic situations, the after-effects of Vietnam and Watergate, etc.) tells them not to.  Occasionally, you have songs such as \\"Racing In the Street ('78)\\" and this compilation's title track which puts-aside the implications and just tells the listener the truth: These people are struggling and doing all they can to keep it together.<br /><br />An interesting component of this record is that Bruce re-recorded some of these songs in 2010/2011.  Yes, they were writtten in the 1970s and yes, the musical arrangments were/are recorded with 1970s sensibilities, but - for one reason or another - they were not recorded or, at least, recorded to Bruce's satisfaction at the onset.  This is Bruce Springsteen, after all, folks.  A man famous for his O.C.D. tendencies when in the studio.<br /><br />While some Amazon reviewers believe Bruce's 2010/2011 updates of songs written in the '70s spoils the authenticity of the record, I think it adds to it.  You have the Bruce Springsteen of 2010 having a conversation of sorts with the Bruce Springsteen of 1976/'77/'78.  With songs such as \\"Save My Love\\", you hear the Bruce Springsteen of today (whose voice is more mature and aged, yet still rich) talk to the Bruce of the '70s, as if he is saying, \\"Man, what a journey!\\"  In other words, I think this record is an older Springsteen compiling and re-recording material within the context that today's Springsteen is not the Springsteen people listened to and knew in 1978...  And everything (including this record) is better-off for it!

B00516ZWRE|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews of this album, this is the missing link between Crusader and Power And The Glory. Raging Anthem Rock songs that are sorely missed in today's rock music. Saxon can go from grinding out heavy metal headbanging songs to straight up AC/DC style rock songs. All Saxon's early stuff sounded and was based on AC/DC style riffing as is this album. It's not the most original Saxon album but all the songs kick major ass!. If you don't like this you need your head checked. I've been a Saxon fan since I was 14,I'm 41. When I first heard Crusader I was blown away. I liked everything they've done except a few albums like \\"Rock The Nations\\" or \\"Destiny\\" but even those have great songs on them. Nibbs is one of my favorite bassists. I think he's improved a lot over the years and is a perfect replacement for Steve Dawson. Sure they're not 21 years old anymore but being in their 60's they still prove they can't go wrong,they are better than most bands in their 30's. all songs are solid. Hammer of the Gods is blazin' Iron Maiden style track about Viking ships how can you go wrong?. Nigel has been with Saxon since Power and The Glory so i consider him pretty much original. Pete Gill was a flake. I don't wish Saxon to ever reform with original members. The original line up would never have given us Killing Ground or Lionheart. Give it a listen , it'll grow on you. This is a solid heavy metal/rock album. Just like Motorhead at least we can expect a Saxon album every few years and the chances of it being good are high. Now wish they'd play the Northwest States. They aren't on the Call to Arms tour, bummer. I still love em tho.

0765350386|5.0|I rarely write reviews for books that have been on shelves for years, books that already have plenty of reviews from other sources. That being said Brandon Sanderson deserves to be credited for what he accomplished with Mistborn. This is my first Sanderson novel, and halfway through I became so entranced that I went ahead and ordered the rest of the Mistborn trilogy as well as Warbreaker, Elantris, and The Way of Kings. This was a considerably small fortune to spend in books but having finished Mistborn I believe it was money I will consider well spent.<br /><br />Mistborn is captivating. From beginning to end, readers will be sucked in and locked into the fate of this world Sanderson has created and the people who inhabit it. Sanderson is a masterful world builder and as chapters go by the city of Luthadel and the Central Dominance become fleshed out into a beautifully desolate land. From the ashfalls and mists to the skaa slums and noble keeps, Luthadel is as oppressive as it is intriguing.<br /><br />Well realized as the city and surrounding areas may be, the characters are the real star here. Mistborn is a coming of age tale in many ways. The main protagonist of the novel is Vin, a street urchin who has lived a terribly rough life. From the start it is impossible not to sympathize with Vin. The horrors of Vin's past become ever more evident as she is introduced to a highly skilled thieving crew with aspirations to over throw the empire. Things like friendship and trust are alien concepts to Vin. Then there is Kelsier, the Survivor of Hathsin, a half-breed thief turned revolutionary. Kelsier is at once a likable character. From his attitude to his actions, Kelsier is absorbing to read about. The rest of the crew are easily likable, despite their differences. Later in the book as characters die it can be heart wrenching to see these characters in peril. The noble houses and imperial ministry make for great enemies to the crew, with the inquisitors playing an especially heinous role. Then of course there is the Lord Ruler, Sliver of Infinity, and God-Emperor of the Dominances. The Lord Ruler is shrouded in mystery and fear, and though he doesn't make a true appearance until later in the novel he is certainly a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />The magic system Sanderson created for the Mistborn universe is called Allomancy and readers of fantasy are unlikely to find a more intricate and \\"realistic\\" magic system anywhere else. Allomancy has rules and limitations just as though it were a part of the natural world. Physics still apply, though they can be tampered with. Allomancy is extremely cool, though at sometimes it can seem to be a bit much to remember all the terms and specialties. The fight scenes between Allomancers are thrilling, and innovation and improvisation are factors far more likely to win a battle than brute strength. Another magic system is later introduced called Feruchemy but it doesn't seem nearly as well developed, thought perhaps that will be solved in the sequels.<br /><br />The plot of Mistborn is phenomenal. Sanderson expertly paces the chapters and events. There is a lot going on in the book but never does the reader lose track of all the separate strands. The basic idea os a revolution is a sure enough staple in fantasy and science fiction but instead of a straight up battle against a numerically superior foe Kelsier and the gang plan an elaborate \\"heist\\" to topple the government. There are twists and turns and plenty of set up for the sequels though Mistborn could be read as a standalone work. Questions are raised and questions are answered but as Kelsier is known to say, \\"There is always another secret.\\".

When you start this book it's impossible to put it down. Its historical venue gives an insight into very different life style and values; its educational component is hard to underestimate in regard to modern spectrum of politics, religions and globalization.   Besides it all, you will just love it - it utterly sincere and well written.

B005ELZKWS|3.0|Chickenfoot made a big impact a couple of years ago with their debut album which was full of great playing and a fun vibe but their second album fails to hit the same sweet spot. It seems like they have lost a bit of the spark that fired up the first album and although the songs are solid there really isn't anything that grooves as much as the debut. The music is performed well despite the lack of intensity in the songs but I feel like Sammy's vocals are kind of flat compared to the debut. On a more positive note, the vocal harmonies are excellent between Sammy and Mike and there are some cool guitar licks from Satriani. Highlights include the melodic chorus of \\"Different Devil\\", the wicked guitar riff in \\"Up Next\\", and the smooth groove of \\"Come Closer\\". The packaging on this album is amazing with an awesome glossy cover and a bonus DVD with behind the scenes footage, a live performance, and a film clip. I was really hoping for a more explosive record from Chickenfoot considering how good their debut was but unfortunately this doesn't quite deliver the goods - 3.5 stars.

1608191664|1.0|In Thing 3 the author makes a clearly stated premise about the wage of laborers and attributes it to free market theory. The premise is definitely and demonstrably not a part of free market economics and only two reasons can be attributed to this gross error.  In the first, the author is ignorant of the subject matter and the book's content should be ignored as reading an author who is ignorant of his subject matter is a waste of time.  The second is that the author is trying to deceive the reader, whom he may well expect is not well versed in economic theory.The book's content should again be ignored as accepting the instruction of someone trying to deceive you in the guise of teaching you is self defeating.  I am not asking you to not read this book, although getting it from the library as opposed to purchasing a copy you may well not want to keep is advisable, rather I am asking that you be cautious if you choose to invest your time.  As for the two possible reasons for the error in Thing 3, the author is a teacher of economics.

B005NMBZJU|4.0|There is no question that when it has came down to great songs, Sting has been honestly one of the most melodic and intimate singer/songwriters that have came out for over 30 years. He has honestly never lost his luster, and his songs still just stand as strong today, and as organic as they did back when they were recorded. Sting has a lot of joy to celebrate in more ways than one this year. He will be celebrating soon his 60th birthday with open arms, and it has been over a quater of a century since he broke out on his own, and away from his trademark of The Police, and branched out joy and songs to call his own. Also, to celebrate he has decided to release a boxed set of music to call his own.<br /><br />Sting: 25 Years is a cavalcade of songs from his 25 years since he came out on his own with The Dream of The Blue Turtles in 1985, to call his own. There are no songs during his days with The Police, all just his own work and his style of music. So you find Every Breath You Take or Roxanne on this set. The collection of music holds well and showcases his solo work from his hits, to his overlooked gems. The collection of songs holds mostly well, and is worth the money for hard core fans, and a nice starter for new fans to his simplicity songs. The boxed set of music includes his biggest hits including If I Ever Lose My Faith In You, If You Love Somebody Set Them Free, as well as some of his under-appreciated gems like the beautifully enchanting When We Dance, The Soul Cages, the tropical Love Is The Seventh Wave, and Brand New Day. The collection is mostly worth its money, yet there were a few surprises that were honestly overlooked from this collection. The big overshadowed songs included Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot from 1996's Mercury Falling, After The Rain Has Fallen and the original version of Russians instead of the version from his under-performed 2010 Symphonicities, to just name a few.<br /><br />Still, despite a few flaws, Sting: 25 Years is mainly worth its money. His music after all the years has never lost its luster, and still remains just as delightful as you could imagine. I really recommend this as a great compliment to any die hard fan of Sting's after all his time. It is a great reminder of what brilliant music is like, especially in a time where lately artists have been coming out like corny music like Rihanna, Lady Gaga and Beyonce'. It is just a reminder of why Sting said, \\"Stop Before You Start, Be Still My Beating Heart.\\"<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+after all the years has never lost its luster, and still remains just as delightful as you could imagine.

For too long I have been disappointed with JW's output and especially his live shows. I was starting to get that sinking feeling that he was through. The songs have been done before so many times, but this disc actually makes them sound fresh. There are so many great players on this disc. Johnny sounds in great voice and playing. It's stinks that there are no liner notes because this CD should have had them. I think Johnny will ge up for an award in 2012. Lets hope so.

B00005QAPH|5.0|The conventional wisdom is that Federico Fellini went wrong when he abandoned realism for personal fantasy; that starting with \\"La Dolce Vita\\", his work ran wild through jungles of Freudian, Christian, sexual and autobiographical images. The precise observation in \\"La Strada\\" was the high point of his career, according to this view, and then he abandoned his neorealist roots. \\"La Dolce Vita\\" was bad enough, \\"8 1/2\\" was worse, and by the time he made \\"Juliet of the Spirits\\", he was completely off the rails. Then all is downhill, in a career that lasted until 1987, except for \\"Amarcord\\", with its memories of Fellini's childhood; that one is so charming that you have to cave in and enjoy it, regardless of theory.   This conventional view is completely wrong. What we think of as Felliniesque comes to full flower in \\"La Dolce Vita\\" and \\"8 1/2.\\" His later films, except for \\"Amarcord,\\" are not as good, and some are positively bad, but they are stamped with an unmistakable maker's mark. The earlier films, wonderful as they often are, have their Felliniesque charm weighted down by leftover obligations to neorealism.   The critic Alan Stone, writing in the Boston Review, deplores Fellini's \\"stylistic tendency to emphasize images over ideas.\\" I celebrate it. A filmmaker who prefers ideas to images will never advance above the second rank because he is fighting the nature of his art. The printed word is ideal for ideas; film is made for images, and images are best when they are free to evoke many associations and are not linked to narrowly defined purposes. Here is Stone on the complexity of \\"8 1/2\\": \\"Almost no one knew for sure what they had seen after one viewing.\\" True enough. But true of all great films, while you know for sure what you've seen after one viewing of a shallow one.   \\"8 1/2\\" is the best film ever made about filmmaking. It is told from the director's point of view, and its hero, Guido, is clearly intended to represent Fellini. It begins with a nightmare of asphyxiation, and a memorable image in which Guido floats off into the sky, only to be yanked back to earth by a rope pulled by his associates, who are hectoring him to organize his plans for his next movie. Much of the film takes place at a spa near Rome, and at the enormous set Guido has constructed nearby for his next film, a science fiction epic he has lost all interest in.   The film weaves in and out of reality and fantasy. Some critics complained that it was impossible to tell what was real and what was taking place only in Guido's head, but I have never had the slightest difficulty, and there is usually a clear turning point as Guido escapes from the uncomfortable present into the accommodating world of his dreams.   Sometimes the alternate worlds are pure invention, as in the famous harem scene where Guido rules a house occupied by all of the women in his life--his wife, his mistresses, and even those he has only wanted to sleep with. In other cases, we see real memories that are skewed by imagination. When little Guido joins his schoolmates at the beach to ogle the prostitute Saraghina, she is seen as the towering, overpowering, carnal figure a young adolescent would remember. When he is punished by his priests of his Catholic school, one entire wall is occupied by a giant portrait of Dominic Savio, a symbol of purity in that time and place; the portrait, too large to be real, reflects Guido's guilt that he lacks the young saint's resolve.   All of the images come together into one of the most tightly structured films Fellini made. The screenplay is meticulous in its construction--and yet, because the story is about a confused director who has no idea what he wants to do next, \\"8 1/2\\" itself is often described as the flailings of a filmmaker without a plan. \\"What happens,\\" asks a Web-based critic, \\"when one of the world's most respected directors runs out of ideas, and not just in a run-of-the-mill kind of way, but whole hog, so far that he actually makes a film about himself not being able to make a film?\\" But \\"8 1/2\\" is not a film about a director out of ideas--it is a film filled to bursting with inspiration. Guido is unable to make a film, but Fellini manifestly is not.   Mastroianni plays Guido as a man exhausted by his evasions, lies and sensual appetites. He has a wife, chic and intellectual, who he loves but cannot communicate with, and a mistress, cheap and tawdry, who offends his taste but inflames his libido. He manages his affairs so badly that both women are in the spa town at the same time, along with his impatient producer, his critical writer, and uneasy actors who hope or believe they will be in the film. He finds not a moment's peace. \\"Happiness,\\" Guido muses late in the film, \\"consists of being able to tell the truth without hurting anyone.\\" That gift has not been mastered by Guido's writer, who tells the director his film is \\"a series of complete senseless episodes,\\" and \\"doesn't have the advantage of the avant-garde films, although it has all of the drawbacks.\\"   Guido seeks advice. Aged clerics shake their heads sadly and inspire flashbacks to childhood guilt. The writer, a Marxist, is openly contemptuous of his work. Doctors advise him to drink mineral water and get rest, a lot of rest. The producer begs for quick rewrites; having paid for the enormous set, he insists that it be used. And from time to time Guido visualizes his ideal woman, who is embodied by Claudia Cardinale: cool, comforting, beautiful, serene, uncritical, with all the answers and no questions. This vision, when she appears, turns out to be a disappointment, but in his mind he transforms her into a Muse, and takes solace in her imaginary support.   Fellini's camera is endlessly delighting. His actors often seem to be dancing rather than simply walking. I was interested to read that he played music during every scene. The music must have brought a lift and subtle rhythm to their movements. Of course many scenes have music built into them: In \\"8 1/2,\\" orchestras, dance bands and strolling musicians are seen, and the actors move in a subtly choreographed way, as if they're synchronized. Fellini's scores, by Nino Rota, combine snatches of pop tunes with dance music, propelling the action.   Few directors make better use of space. One of his favorite techniques is to focus on a moving group in the background and track with them past foreground faces that slide in and out of frame. He also likes to establish a scene with a master shot, which then becomes a closeup when a character stands up into frame to greet us. Another technique is to follow his characters as they walk, photographing them in three-quarter profile, as they turn back toward the camera. And he likes to begin dance sequences with one partner smiling invitingly toward the camera before the other partner joins in the dance.   All of these moves are brought together in his characteristic parades. Inspired by a childhood love of the circus, Fellini used parades in all his films--not structured parades but informal ones, people moving together toward a common goal or to the same music, some in the foreground, some farther away. \\"8 1/2\\" ends with a parade that has deliberate circus overtones, with a parade of musicians, major characters, and the grotesques, eccentrics and \\"types\\" that Fellini loved to cast in his films.   I have seen \\"8 1/2\\" over and over again, and my appreciation only deepens. It does what is almost impossible: Fellini is a magician who discusses, reveals, explains and deconstructs his tricks, while still fooling us with them. He claims he doesn't know what he wants or how to achieve it, and the film proves he knows exactly, and rejoices in his knowledge.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|GOt a couple of these for our field bags...one lives in the glove box of the woods rig.    It's not the same as a whetstone or even a stone system...but it's fast, efficient, and takes up little room.  It's also a plus that it's so light in the pack.
0553208845|5.0|Heard about this book for years and just somehow never got to reading it. Finally this year I did and felt like kicking myself for the delay. Its justifiably famous, so moving....now I get what all the fuss was about. Busy gifting it to all the friends who haven't read it so we can have some interesting discussions. Its an easy read, such a small book but with some amazing insights - no wonder its a classic.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These are about as basic a headphones as you can get. They certainly don't look too snazzy, but as a runner, they are perfect and stay in my ears, unlike earbuds. They aren't too sturdy, and will likely fall apart in 6 months like all headphones do, but for the price, it's worth it. Just don't expect the world.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|Zuckerberg's opening statement in the movie - \\"Did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States,\\" reflects either Zuckerberg's fatuity, which I doubt, or the screenplay writer's - Dean Evenson's (who probably didn't score 1600 in his SAT).  In the distribution of IQ scores of any large randomly sampled population, we use an operational definition of those referred to as \\"cognitive elite\\" or \\"genius\\" as the top 5 percent or the 95th percentile of that population.  China today has a population of 1,348,527,108 people; those in China who would probably be considered genius number approximately 67,426,355 individuals (POP X 0.05).  The population of the U.S. today is approximately 311,000,000 - an amount far greater than the 67.4 million probable geniuses in China.  Those whom you would consider to be \\"unusually bright\\" are probably somewhere in the upper fractions of the 99th percentile - a very thin slice of the overall Chinese distribution and much fewer than the 67.4 mil calculated above.   That un-nerdy statement at the beginning of a movie about nerds turned me off immediately, however, the acting and the rapid fire dialogue resurrected my interest!  If you don't find this review helpful, then please correct the percentiles - I'd like to see your reasoning, if any.
B0055S348W|5.0|I have to say this is a great app.  I used to have to fire up my pc or laptop in order to get a print out of an email or web page.  Now I can print it quickly right from my phone.  It has found all three printers I have needed to print to.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|All reviews are correct on this one...it is a shocking, depressing, nasty movie that will stay with you.  However the more you know about the politics behind this film the more you will understand why it is a great film and far less a horror film than maybe a satirical commentary on Serbia and the recent wars.  That still will not wipe clean the memories you will have after seeing this but they may help to answer the question of why someone would make a film like this.  Most if not all of the most disturbing films made throughout history have been political.  This one has many similarities with Salo in its debasements of humans.  Maybe it is the basis in history that makes a film like this so much more powerful than a film like Human Centipede which was based on a joke.  A Serbian Film is no joke.    However, for a true journey into hell, nothing I have seen to date beats Come and See...not a horror film in the least but nightmare inducing all the same.  PS...for those who like to read reviews after seeing a film...the most disturbing part of the newborn p... was not the actions of the man but rather the look of pleasure on the woman's face as she was watching what the man was doing...she was getting excited...that was for me sickening.
B004XKVPG6|5.0|The movie looked and sounded great. It looks as if it came out this year so I was very excited to re live that experience again

B005ISQ7JM|5.0|An excellent piece of writing and a pleasure to read. Most books on similar subjects are too dry and too difficult to comprehend if it's about a new concept for me. Brett's lively treatment helped me grasp what I've struggled to understand and enabled me to put the thoughts together so that even I get the sense of it.<br /><br />I've been working out of a hole in the wall in the middle of nowhere so long I must thank Brett for this excellent piece of work. Even though it will take going over several times to make it work for me it's on my Mac Kindle to view it any time I need to.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Charles / EuroPartsHouse.com
0767827716|5.0|They don't make horror movies like this anymore! I particularly love this movie because from 1995-1998, I owned a Chevy Corsica, great car but when strange things started happening, I named her Christine. Most memorable, while on a 1st date, the battery dies, she just didn't like the guy. Next date, in zero degree weather, her thermostat blew! We drove home scrapping the ice off windshield with a credit card!! She died of internal engine damage in Jan. 1998. I loved you Christine!!
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I have been a life long fan of Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac's music and performances.  At 62 you wonder if Stevie could get any better?  The answer is absolutely she can and does.  In my opinion this is her best work yet.  She has the amazing ability to be in touch with current cultural themes and events and this album displays that to perfection delivered with her legendary \\"other worldly\\" air and flair.  Grateful for the beautiful music and looking forward to hearing more in the years to come from this beautiful songbird.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I am a huge Beth hart fan, and I couldn't wait to hear this one. I didn't know how she's going to work with Joe, whom I haven't really heard before. the result: EPIC. Beth sing her heart out, and there is a great flow to the album from start to finish. I wish it could be a little longer, but it's still work so well.<br /><br />If you're a fan of good music, you're going to love DON'T EXPLAIN.
0307346617|5.0|By now zombies have invaded every popular medium of entertainment, so it's natural to be a little fatigued when facing yet another story of the living dead.  However, this book stands out because of its peculiarity in telling the story, and its amusing cleverness.  The story is told through oral accounts of survivors of the war, coming from many different levels of society and places of the world.  It tells how the zombies were first noticed, the kind of response they elicited from civilians and governments and which countries reacted quicker or more dramatically.  It proceeds to unveil the course of the war and its eventual conclusion with plenty of gore, suspense and smart details.  The reader can definitely see how much the writer loves the topic at hand, because he has thought of practically everything, refreshing the familiar knowledge of the undead, and often surprising us with things that we wouldn't have normally thought about.  Not everything is perfectly explained though, because this is not a proper novel. It reads like a set of interviews in a World War II documentary, with characters that are quite believable when they chat about their profession, culture, experiences and personal views, but it is much more fun to read than the documentary-style would generally indicate.  Simply put, if you have enjoyed any movie/game/comic/tv series/book/haunted house with zombies in it, then you will enjoy this book.  By the end of it you may even believe World War Z actually happened!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This show is so addictive. I watched the first episode of Blood and Sand and was hooked. Hearing that Andy Whitfield had cancer and has now passed is truly sad. He was a great actor and now a cult figure, he must surely be among the Gods now. As for Gods of the Arena. More sex and violence, more twists and back stabbing. It was great to see how the characters became who they are in Blood and Sand. Gannicus is awesome... Lucretia is all and some, a devoted wife and a devil in disguise.... and Batiatus just cracks me up with his anger and spouts of vengance. His choice of words are so powerful and yet so funny as I've never heard anything like it before....'words fall from his mouth like sh** from my ***' Classic! This bluray was $35 only a few weeks ago but when I saw the price had dropped to $25 it was a must buy!!!! I can not wait for Season 2 - Vengance. :o Andy Whitfield - you will never be forgotten. You are a legend in my eyes.
B005HEU202|5.0|I get a steady 480p stream without any disconnects or pauses. There's still a mild pixelation around object contours during high-speed motion scenes. But overall, the TNG experience here is better than anywhere else on the web.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|If you are without pen/paper this will work, but without stylus friendly screens, writing with the finger can be messy. Be sure to write big and as clearly as possible. A quick &quot;chicken scratch&quot; will not be easy to read!

B005HEUF0Y|5.0|A tear wells up in my eyes evertime I see this episode.  It is by far one of the best STNG episodes.  You'll be missing out if you haven't seen this.  Patrick Stewart does an amazing job fulfilling this short but well played life long story of Captain Picard finding himself in another life.  After years on this planet Picard finds himself resigned to live the life he is now in as his own.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|When I heard about these sets, I really became excited.  DSOTM is one of the most important pop records ever.  As such, I had very high expectations that upon receiving and enjoying this set... I realize I only got today, were not fully realized.  As a serious Floyd collector... I have soundboard recordings of the band going all the way back to Piper at the Gates of Dawn, I know what the band has access to and had expected some serious contributions from those vaults for these immersion sets....  Disc 1: James Guthrie remaster  This is worth doing and bringing it up to par with the vinyl remaster he did a few years ago for the 30th Anniversary.  If you have any of the Japanese remasters, this probably does nothing for you.  For the masses, a very worth while undertaking 4/5  Disc 2: Live from Wembley 1974  While a valuable edition to those without access to this sort of material, a poor choice!!!!  Firstly, Pink Floyd had been playing DSOTM for 2 years by the time this recording was made AND this recording was actually made during the WISH YOU WERE HERE tour... you will notice this is the same show being used for the WISH YOU WERE HERE immersion set, which also includes rough recordings of material that will later show up on ANIMALS.  Sure, by 1974 they had the technology to perform the show in the same manner as they recorded it unlike the actual tours for DSOTM.  And finally, this was performed as the 2nd set of the show with the WISH YOU WERE HERE material and rough Animals material having opened the show....  4/5 for historical value 3/5 for its inclusion and 2/5 for completeness.  NOTE: combine this with WISH YOU WERE HERE immersion material and the show is still NOT COMPLETE.sad  Disc 3:  Various different mixes digitized for CD.  For completists wanting the material in one place versus having to make various seperate purchases as this material is already available.  3/5  Disc 4 and 5:  DVD AND Blu Ray of various unreleased material.  I really enjoyed this 4/5Disc 6:  Unreleased material and mixes.  While I had most of this material from various sources, this would be a very welcome edition to the collection of average folks. 3/5  OTHER BONUS STUFF: 2/5  While intersting the very first time you open the box, this will very quickly do nothing more than gather dust.  Save the cost of production and the environment and skip this sort of thing.
B0058A119G|1.0|Ms Streisand has chosen the most uninteresting cover photo ever. It is like looking at the granny section of a Marks and Spenser's mail order catalogue while standing in a conservatory. As for the album it has to be the most boring since Higher Ground in 1997. The only saving grace is `Windmills of Your Mind' which is the only track worth noting. I am sure that she tried to breakout a sweat while recording this album but quite frankly Ms Streisand I thinks one should not have bothered. Not only has she missed the mark by miles she simply hasn't got the voice anymore and I for one will be returning it to the shop.
B001Q8FRNA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1BOKM6X1M2DA7]]Here the trailer to the Movie that was made about the Monks. The film is based on the one and only Monks record \\"black monk time\\".<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001RBY9D0 Monks: The Transatlantic Feedback]]
B0034G4ORC|3.0|This is more of a war film than sci-fi in the sense that the emphasis is on the military combat scenes, mostly ground combat, and is shot in a hand-held camera way. Although the soldiers are fighting aliens (and I don't think it's a spoiler to reveal that since you can figure it out from the trailers and it's revealed very early in the film) we don't get a lot of info on them, what they're here for, etc. - in other words, the story isn't about them or their relationship with any humans. It's about the fight.<br /><br />It's also about the soldiers, which the film tries very hard to make us care about. Aaron Eckhart stars as a battle-weary, middle-aged staff sargent, who has decided to retire, but gets pulled into this battle before that comes about. He is the only character that I even remotely cared about, because he's a fine actor, and despite a horridly cliche script, manages to bring some real depth to this character at times. The others characters are nothing more than stereotypes, borrowed from every war script ever written - the cocky just-out-school officer, the soldier about to get married, the soldier whose wife is about to have a baby, the just-out-of-high-school virgin, etc. I couldn't keep them straight, and so I could hardly mourn the passing of those who didn't make it.<br /><br />I also found myself confused at times, because of the way the film is shot. I know it's trying to capture the chaos of battle, but as a viewer, we still need to make some sense of it, so it's more than simply a video game of fight after fight. I couldn't always follow what they were trying to do, so too often it was just random explosions and yelling to me.<br /><br />So overall, the 3-stars is for the quality of the combat scenes and the special effects, but I couldn't go any higher than that because of the uninspired writing and confusion.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|i like how the texts are shrunk after you write. i think it would do better if it were a dollar app not 3 bucks.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE, LOVE , LOVE THE NEW ALBUM FROM LADY ANTEBELLUM!  EVERY SINGLE SONG IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  WHEN I HEARD THE SONG, \\"OWN THE NIGHT\\", IT MADE ME THINK OF MY FIRST LOVE A LONG TIME AGO (WHO I STILL TEND TO DREAM ABOUT FROM TIME TO TIME).  IT REMINDS ME OF HOW PRECIOUS THE TIME THAT WE HAD WAS AND HOW TIME STOOD STILL AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERED.  THE LYRICS TO THE SONG ARE SO VERY TRUE, BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE WITH SOMEONE OR IF WE WILL EVER SPEAK OR SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN, SO WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERY PRECIOUS MOMENT WE HAVE.  I LOVE EVERY SINGLE SONG ON THE ALBUM!  I DRIVE OVER 500 MILES A WEEK FOR WORK AND I PUT THE CD IN, BLAST THE MUSIC, AND EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD SEEMS PERFECT!  I ALSO LOVE, LOVE, LOVE \\"JUST A KISS\\".  iT IS THE PERFECT SONG TO REMIND US OF THAT GREAT LOVE IN OUR LIFE WHO MAKES IT HARD FOR US TO BREATHE WHEN WE ARE AROUND THEM AND HOW YOU WAIT YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS SPECIAL PERSON TO COME!  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC MUSIC.  IT TRULY SOOTHES MY SOUL AND HELPS ME TO BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.  EVERY SONG IS AWESOME.....TRUST ME....\\"FRIDAY NIGHT\\" IS ALSO GREAT AS WELL AS \\"SOMEWHERE LOVE REMAINS\\".  I WILL FOREVER BE A FAN OF LADY ANTEBELLUM!  THEY MAKE THE MUSIC AND THE WORLD SWEETER WITH EACH SPECTACULAR ALBUM THEY CREATE!!
0439023513|2.0|I DEVOURED The Hunger Games and Catching Fire within two days, and was extremely excited to finish off the series with Mockingjay. However, I was sorely disappointed. The fire that Katniss had shown in the beginning of the novel died down within the middle of the book, coming to a complete failure of an ending that Collins wrote.   There were so many unresolved plot lines that could have been resolved; not necessarily with sugar and rainbows, but closure would have been nice.  Instead, Gale was completely and utterly swept under the table, and instead of a reunion with, perhaps, an alarmingly alive Cinna, we get....Effie? Seriously? She wasn't even a contributing factor to Katniss' personality, which was already completely shattered. Instead of the powerful heroine leading the resistance, by the end of the lurching, hurriedly put together ending, we get a broken, watered down version of Katniss that barely seems to function.  And that's it. A completely dissatisfying end to what could have been so much more in the Panem universe.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Love it but for one nuance...  The 4x1 and 4x2 widgets don't update the data correctly once the screen has been rotated to landscape and back to portrait, and put into standby. Must change orientation of screen again to force the displayed data to refresh properly.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I don't think I could stomach watching it again, but I did think it was great in all the basics: great characters, great plot, great action scenes. This movie is really worth watching in theaters to get the full experience of the sound effects. And James Franco rocked.   But--and this is my criticism of the theme, which I know won't work if we are to buy into this exposition and move on to the Planet of the Apes--the violent overthrow of the dominant species by a virus and a band of apes? It's highly disturbing... they don't show any mercy when pushing that one guy off the Golden Gate bridge from the helicopter, but I guess they're not supposed to; they're beasts tired of being brutalized in science experiments after all. The fact that people go watch this movie is kind of like having your dog watch another dog get put to sleep in front of it. And there's not even a ray of hope at the end for the human race. How am I supposed to sympathize for an ape?  As a side note, Freida Pinto, an Indian actress who admits that she's \\"not that famous in India,\\" seems to be racking in the big bucks, doing what other crossover actors from Bollywood won't do, which stunted their career growth: kissing on the mouth. Kudos to her career.  Anyhow, it's a great movie, made all the more thrilling by a disturbing premise.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|I was very excited to receive my Stagnate universe DVD   I was very disappointed to see it has region code 1 on it. the  code was not mentioned on the amazon web site. common guys we live in a global on line community now. get out of the dark ages.

B002RSDW80|5.0|Meryl Streep and Amy Adams were convincing as Julia Child and Julie Powell. Even my foreign-born husband, who doesn't watch anything but action films and doesn't know who Julia Child is, can't help imitating Meryl Streep's inflection as Julia Child, several days after he watched the movie with me. Great French scenery, great treatment of the book (the part of it I managed to get through anyway), and supportive husbands. The film was a real delight! I'd watch it again anytime.
B005EHNEDO|5.0|Wilco is one of those bands you can never sleep on.  Nearly a decade removed from their most esteemed album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, circumstances have changed for the Chicago-based rockers. There was a time in which Wilco couldn't do anything without causing everyone to stand up and take notice.  My senior year in high school was the year A Ghost Is Born came out, and everyone was talking about that record. It was everywhere. You couldn't escape the buzz from that album if you bought real estate under a giant boulder.  But if you were one of those, like me, who soon tired of the Wilco hype, you eventually got your wish. It wouldn't be fair to say the hype died, but I don't remember the previous two albums generating the same level of hysteria we saw with Ghost.  But now it is 2011 and I've got to eat my words. I finally decided to give Wilco an in-depth listen, and I see what the big deal is. If there's a new wave of hype over the latest Wilco record, don't expect to see me run for cover. Because if there's any justice, The Whole Love should start a revolution of its own.  The Whole Love seems to strike a medium between the two extremes the band painted in the 2000s. It's certainly more level headed than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born, but is more adventurous than their last effort, Wilco (the album). The opener, \\"Art of Almost,\\" builds up slowly, leaving you wondering what exactly this album has in store for you. But when the extended guitar solo kicks in, you know you're in for a truly unique ride.  As a listener who appreciates variety, The Real Love is an easy sell. This album has it all, from sprawling epics to clashing rockers and well crafted pop nuggets.  \\"I Might\\" sees the band combining pop and rock styles like second nature. You are treated to strong hooks that are punctuated by guitar pyrotechnics going off left and right. When Jeff Tweedy's voice kicks in during the chorus, I can't help but notice he sounds a bit like John Lennon.  And speakingof Beatles influence, another treat comes on \\"Sunloathe.\\" It's dreary at first, but picks up as it goes along. The second half reminds me of the Abbey Road medley, particularly in regard to the harmonies and drum fills.  One fact Wilco fans should be well aware of is that there's nothing quite like the effect of a dynamic frontman. There are few tracks that better accentuate that than \\"Standing O,\\" a rollicking rocker on which Tweedy confidently asserts himself -- \\"Maybe you've noticed I'm not afraid of everything that I've done / Maybe you've noticed I'm not the same as almost anyone.\\"  And if you like Wilco's lyricism, \\"Dawned On Me,\\" will also be high on your favorites list. I enjoy the aggressive attitude and the way the words wrap around each verse. Look at the second verse:  \\"I've been lost  I've been found  I've been taken by the sound\\"  It's simple, but dramatic when delivered the way Tweedy does it.  This is the song most deeply ingrained in my head right now.  \\"Black Moon\\" and \\"Rising Red Lung\\" are mellow, quiet, and thought provoking. They're the two songs on The Whole Love that best reflect on Wilco's alt-country roots, and they're the two songs that best represent my state of mind when I'm ready to chill out.  \\"Capitol City\\" has a jovial, bouncy, show tune-y feel to it. \\"Open Mind\\" is an emotional ballad, with lyrics that tug at your heart strings. Then you have \\"Born Alone,\\" one of my personal favorites. At first glance it's your typical pop/rock gem, but near the end it gets reflective and really rocks out.  The Whole Love comes to a close with \\"One Sunday Morning (Song for Jane Smiley's Boyfriend)\\" a devastatingly vivid 12 minute chronicle on the deterioration of a relationship between father and son. Pay close attention to the lyrics and it'll produce a lump in your throat.  What makes Wilco great is the sincerity of everything they produce, coupled with the unique musical ideas that seem to turn up on each of their records. The Whole Love is the perfect album if you're looking for something refreshing, or for anyone who's a fan of great songwriting.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|The cooler was a project to install.  I work with my hands and appreciate the thought and effort that went into design of the cooler attachment.  For such a large and heavy thing it is probably better attached to the mother board than any other cooler I've ever installed.  That said it took me almost half an hour to figure out which parts to use and what and goes where.  It was a fair amount of trial and error.  I can well imagine that some people will just give up in frustration.  The instructions are too generic, i.e. sketches with few words.  Be prepared to study all the parts and try to figure it out on your own.  The cooler is very effective for what its supposed to do.  My i7 2600k overclocked CPU never heats above 50c, and is more like 35c.  What I don't care for is the fan, it makes a droning sound that grates on my ears as it speeds up and slows down.  The noise is not loud, but just annoying, my PC is in a quiet room.  I had thought a 120mm fan to be silent, most are at low speed.  This one is not, maybe I got one with a bad bearing, but I don't think so.  I will be replacing the fan soon.
1400069181|4.0|This book is a story of how a tiny simple idea, with the right people, and at the right time can make it big. It is a dream that came into reality that even the dreamer was surprised of how he made it from point A to point B.  This is how TOMS was born.  TOMS came from the phrase, \\"TOMorrow's Shoes\\"). For every pair that is sold, another pair will be donated to the needy.  He hit it big, because not only people like his shoes, but they like the grand idea of the possibility of helping others with their purchase.<br /><br />Blake Mycoskie, together with her sister, was a contestant of the \\"Amazing Race\\" when he chanced to see the very popular shoes worn in Argentina, the \\"alpargata\\", where the idea sparked.  Together with the help of some free publicity from the LA Times, Vogue, Time, O, and other national papers and magazines, and his own entrepreneurial spirit, TOMS is now a well known name.  He now owns 4 businesses and has speaking engagements all around the country.<br /><br />Wonderful inspiring story.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|I do not care what anybody says about this movie! This movie made me laugh from beginning to end. It is raunchy and yet hilarious and even has a hint of romance in it. It is very creative and Reynolds and Bateman have amazing chemistry in this movie and the supporting cast, Wilde and Mann, did great justice to heighten Bateman and Reynolds Characters. This movie is VERY inappropriate and kids under 16 should NOT see this and if you like Raunchy, Perverted, Outrageous comedies that have nudity, as well as, strong language and Crude Sexual Content and Humor in them then I highly recommend you see this. If you don't but you crave a great but different kind of comedy then get Crazy, Stupid, Love. Crazy, Stupid, Love is an excellent comedy opposite to this.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Loved the movie...remembered liking the music so got the soundtrack. Am amazed at hearing the different piano and orchestral movements again... and again... and again. Very flowy and serene.
0345528581|4.0|If you're into strength training find yourself in situations where there is no equipment available, this book suggests several ideas for exercises using only your body weight as resistance. There are many exercises shown, covering most body parts. However, a lot of the exercises are variations on one another - for example, many different ways to do tricep dips, different angles and so on. The exercises are sound, some are very difficult. As I say in my book \\"Getting Fit and Staying Fit In You 40s, 50s, and Beyond,\\" my preference for strength training is a gym - I find that most satisfying. But with my travel schedule, I have found many of the exercises in this book to be good substitutes when there is no equipment available. My only real criticism is that there is a great deal of standard fitness filler in the beginning of the book, information that is repeated many times elsewhere. But other than that, it's a very good book.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Hands down this is one of the few movies out there actually worth seeing over and over again!!!  The story is great!  The actors are great!  The acting was superb!

B001NLKWLW|5.0|I LOVED this book! Once I started reading it and got into the story -- which did not take me long -- I hated having to put it down! Especially captivating was how every chapter switches to a different time in the book. I would almost dread the end of a chapter as I was so drawn into that portion of the story, but the minute I turned the page and jumped into the next portion of the story and was immediately swept away.<br /><br />The story opens with Nell's death. She has left everything to her granddaughter, including the secrets of her origin and the search she began to find her past. Her parents weren't her birth parents, rather they found her as an abandoned child and took her as their own. Nell's father tells her this on her 18th birthday and her life is never the same. She would later try to find her past, however the arrival of her granddaughter on her doorstep prevents her from ever succeeding. When she dies, her granddaughter learns her history and is determined to solve the mystery of her past. As the story and the mystery grows, parts are revealed and what you expect changes.<br /><br />I won't ruin the story for anyone but I will say this - so intriguing is the story that it will keep you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. =) An excellent read.
B005EHNMWM|5.0|There is a danger when you try to satisfy everyone that you satisfy no one. Jeff Tweedy is keenly aware of this since in recent years Wilco has tended to polarize music fans who love their experimental side as evidenced on their masterpiece \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" but are not overly keen on their gentle country rock side as evidenced by albums like \\"Sky blue sky\\". But in the world of Wilco the whole is the sum of the parts and in a remarkable career they have become the premier American band by refusing to be pigeonholed and being driven by a sense of sonic adventure. \\"The Whole Love\\" is their eighth full album and comes as a single album or a slightly longer special edition with 4 additional tracks. It essentially covers all Wilco bases with a mix of the experimental and traditional. This is most in evidence on the two best tracks which bookend the main album. First up is the powerful 7 minute plus opener \\"Art of the almost\\" made up of a wonderful cacophony of pulsing synths, propulsive beats and Nels Cline doing a great impression of Richie Blackmore. As a polar opposite the album concludes with the gorgeous twelve minute plus alt country acoustic epic \\"One Sunday Morning (Song For Jane Smiley's Boyfriend)\\" where not one second is wasted and which may be one of Tweedy's finest compositions ever. In between you get some of the best pop songs since Summerteeth and a fine balance between artsy, melodic and country. The single \\"I might\\" for example has a throbbing bass, a sub Doors style keyboard line and enough hooks to catch mackerel. Cline's injects the song with ragged guitar lines as Tweedy who is clearly enjoying himself intones that \\"It's all right/You won't set the kids on fire/But I might\\". Following songs like \\"Sunloathe\\" the truly lovely \\"Black moon\\" and the thing of beauty that is \\"Open mind\\" are a trilogy of mellow Tweedy ballads which anchor the album, although it is the later \\"Rising Red Lung\\" which impresses most with its haunting ghostly guitar lines in the background.<br /><br />Along the way the sub Velvet Underground sound of the excellent \\"Dawned on me\\" starting with a classic Lou Reed riff and ending with some Nels Cline led feedback. One slip does come in the form of \\"Capitol city\\" where Tweedy revisits his Lennon and McCartney enthusiasm on a jaunty sub White Album song that is easier to admire than love. The whimsy however is quickly shattered by the preceding \\"Standing\\" with its 60s organs and raw guitar rock as the band cut lose and even introduce handclaps. While the penultimate title track is inevitably overshadowed by the brilliance of the concluding \\"One Sunday Morning\\" it is a punchy and jaunty song, which could have happily fitted amongst the hazy pop of Summerteeth. The four extra tracks on the special edition include the ironic blues of \\"I love my label\\", the slightly Mexican tinged acoustics of the excellent \\"Message from Mid Bar\\" and a slightly different version of the scintillating \\"Black Moon\\" where on subsequent listens you detect a clear Elliot Smith influence. It is however the six minute plus instrumental \\"Speak into the rose\\" that dominates here as it harks back to \\"A Ghost is Born\\" and the pulsing electronica \\"Spiders (Kidsmoke)\\" and its slowly building simple, driving rhythm and gradual layers of guitars. Five minutes in the band basically have a great wig out but never lose control. It reminds those who ever described Wilco as \\"Dad rock\\" to wash their mouths out and offer profound apologies.<br /><br />Taken as a total package \\"The Whole Love\\" is one of the most enjoyable Wilco albums the band have constructed. Creative freedom might be a factor as its their first album on their own label dBpm Records and yet again recorded in inspired comforts of home at the Chicago loft studio which featured on the Sky Blue Sky videos. Ultimately for long term Wilco fans this album proves that the stability of recent line ups has finally paid off with a set of musicians who could play the spoons for 12 songs and make them sound great. Alternatively were \\"The Whole Love\\" to be your introduction to this great Chicago band you would discover an album chock full of so much music that recalls their great history that its almost a \\"Best Of\\".e them sound great. Alternatively were \\"The Whole Love\\" to be your introduction to this great Chicago band you would discover an album chock full of so much music that recalls their great history that its almost a \\"Best Of\\".
0385534639|5.0|This book does exactly what a book should do - transport you to a fantastical, magical place. I cannot do it the justice some of these other reviews do. I can say - as I read - I had a smile on my face and happiness in my heart.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|The movie is just as funny on DVD as it was in the movies. The bonus features are very few but make it worth owning the DVD- especially the Audio Commentary with Jeff Kinney! He provides insight and humor into the production as well as plugging the Diary of A Wimpy Kid Movie Diary [[ASIN:1419700502 The Wimpy Kid Movie Diary (revised and expanded edition  Diary of a Wimpy Kid)]]<br /><br />Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is a kid's movie, based on a book series written for kids but I have to say that both are thoroughly enjoyable for adults. I find the characters and their experiences relatable and even the most obnoxious characters (well, maybe not Patty), likeable. I do think that for the money there could have been more extras. I would have liked a little comic insert from Jeff Kinney or a Diary of a Wimpy Kid short at the beginning- something to justify the $16.79.
0439023491|5.0|Excellent series for Youth and Adults, good story and easy enjoyable reading. I bought this for my husband because my daughter recommended it.  Now everyone in town is reading the series.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard ever. Worth every penny if you have to buy, but i got it on the free day and I didn't even need it then, i'm sure glad I got it when it was free now I need it. After switching to a rom that had no good keyboard installed. Droid X.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I RARELY GIVE A BOOK FIVES STARS BUT, THIS BOOK DESERVED IT.  IT TOLD THE STORY OF A BROKEN CHILD AND HOW WITH LOVE, PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE CAN HEAL AND TRULY LOVE.  THE STORY WAS SAD BUT, THE ENDING MADE ME HAPPY AND I MAY HAVE TO READ IT ALL OVER AGAIN.. THE POWER OF LOVE IS THE STRONGEST POWER OF ALL
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Pros<br />+ Films look and sound great (better than previous releases of course)<br />+ Simple, but nice box set<br />+ Price on Amazon is a great deal compared to other retailers, so if you buy it you should get it here<br /><br />Cons<br />- As others mentioned, the original versions of the original trilogy are not included<br />- 'Bonus feature' discs are terrible, it takes about 30 seconds to get from the main menu to a single deleted scene, takes almost the same time to go from one deleted scene to another... I could not find a way to \\"Play All\\"<br />- All of the deleted scenes I watched were garbage, Youtube quality video, most are shorter than the time it takes to switch from one deleted scene to the next so most of your time is spent in the superfluous menus<br /><br />I would not buy it again, and I was planning on buying it as a gift for a couple of diehard fans this Christmas - not anymore.
B004498KPU|5.0|I bought this collection on impulse, but it was worth it. Only having just gotten into Michael Jackson's music a little while ago, I can't call myself an all-the-way fan (even though most of his stuff came out before I was born). Still, for someone who wants to watch his films without reading terrible comments on YouTube, this was worth my money. I was really happy with the extended version of \\"Bad.\\" I really only knew the songs on the first disc, but since this purchase I bought three more albums that had those songs. I can't stop listening!   All in all, this is a must-have for any fan, long time or newly discovered. Love you Michael!
0061124265|3.0|The book wasn't too bad, mostly just consists of Paulo developing characters and background stories without any real plot or purpose. Actually the reading is just fine, it's just a waste of time.
0061122416|5.0|Excellent book that teaches to follow our hearts and believe for good things !!! The Alchemist has shown me to believe in myself and the power of positive thinking. It allows us to see that our right thinking will demand the universe to shape a beautiful world for us !!!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I ordered the dual shock 3 controller and they sent me the sixaxis controller. The controller came quick but was the wrong one. They were good about giving a return.
B004ZNARH4|4.0|So here it is... the Dark Side 'Immersion' set.  This is the fifth version I've owned of the legendary album, and I would have been happy to own just the Blu-Ray disc alone here, but of course it is not available separately.  That said, I'm happy to own Disc 6, the 'Extra Audio Tracks,' mainly for the Alan Parsons Mix.  It's interesting to hear for historical value.  The various ephemera, marbles and so on, are kinda fun, but I'm not the type of collector who looks for such items.<br /><br />As for the music, the Quad Mix sounds entirely fantastic on the Blu-Ray disc. Regarding the central Dark Side version of this reissue, the James Guthrie 2011 remaster, I really cannot detect any difference between this and the 2003 remaster that was done for the 30th anniversary of Dark Side.  Perhaps my listening mind is too taken up in the details of the amazing yet ultra-familiar album experience to notice any subtleties.  The Wembley '74 live album, which I'm listening to as I write this, is a solid concert representation of the album.  The sound quality is very good considering the age of the recording.  The additional video concert footage is all relatively good, though some of it suffers a bit from poor camera angles and slightly muddy sound mix.<br /><br />The documentary here is more of promotional vehicle, brief but moderately informative.  The 'Classic Albums' story on Dark Side is really a much more thorough and interesting dissection of the album's creation and would have been a better addition to this set.  I guess the business arrangements for that were too difficult or something.<br /><br />Packaging-wise, this is not the most well organized box set, as opposed to something like the Pixies box.  There are slots for Discs 1-4 built into the set, but everything else is just loose.  Discs 5 & 6 (including the Blu-Ray disc, to me the most important item) are in cardboard sleeves, but there are no designated slots for them within the box.  They're just dropped in with everything else.

B001BANK32|5.0|I had to get this book into my Kindle.  I have been reading and rereading The Shining since I was in junior high.  There is something about the horror of Stephen King that makes all the other horror stories and movies out there just plain 'shallow'.  Now, my teenagers are beginning their adventures with King.  I started them with The Shining.  I love that they are finding that the movie is never as good as the book.  Perfect.
B0040UAYI4|1.0|This is hands down the worst device I have ever bought in my entire 22 years of life. The up and down movements staircase. I used other peoples km saves which fixed the issue but the movement speeds were terrible. My crosshairs would randomly jump sideways or if I moved my mouse slow to aim at a distance it would just skip around. Snipers this is not for you. Hell I don't snipe and I have problems with battle rifles in bf1943. Moving left to right is glitchy and trying to aim with your crosshairs down while someone running sideways from you is hard to aim at. I just couldn't get this damn thing to work properly. I don't sit and camp, I run and gun so I'm moving around at all times and this device is a waste of money for that. If you sit in a bush all day with a shotgun then this is for you.  These GOD folks must get paid or given these devices to put up good reviews.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|on time in great shape better than expected. love the movie and no skips. what a deal these guys are always good
B005MVIF7M|5.0|I have been a massive fan of Wilco's for over 10 years, but to be honest every album since A Ghost Is Born has be a bit disappointing in my opinion.  Their last album, Wilco, didn't even feel like the same band to me, I just couldn't get into it.  The Whole Love, however is a great album.  A must have for any Wilco fan.  I wouldn't call it classic Wilco, since it is different than anything else they have done, but the song writing seems to have gotten back to where it should be.     Best Album of 2011 so far
B004XNGKBS|1.0|Too difficult to &quot;write&quot; with your finger. Need a stylus. Swype is so much better and there are other free notepad apps. Tried  this because it was free today and glad that I don't have to pay the $2.99 pricetag. Definitely not worth it even if it is free. Uninstalled.
0345479092|5.0|I think this book is great and very informative.  I feel better prepared for when my daughter is born.  I will try not to expect her to be a \\"perfect angel\\", but will learn her personality.  And now, because of this book, I am equipped to take care of her according to her personality needs.  It's an easy read, I highly recommend this book!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I live in Argentina,(my apologies if there are any spelling or grammar mistakes here) and I actually LOVE books written in english, and I can actually look autistic reading some books while listening to music through my ereader...and this is exactly what happened to me with this story, which was amazing, I mean, even if it was quite a bit too explicit sometimes, it was perfectly written and  told, and I totally wish there were more books written by Mrs. McGuire...  But lets get to the book itself:  I really loved Travis, and his particular way of loving Abby, his temper, and also the bad-boy thing. I think there could be another story about his brothers, maybe Trent´s.   On the other hand, Abby was great, but at the beginning, she actually treated trav like trash, which kind of bothered me, but then got better.  And then we have Shepley and America, two characters that I really liked, especially Shepley, who took really good care of Abby...  the, I completely loathed Parker, but maybe that was because of my love to Travis, I´m not that sure...  So, to sum up, I HIGHLY RECOMMMEND THIS BOOK, which is one of those you can read all over again a thousand times, and still don´t get bored with (that actually happened to me, I read it over ten times, for sure...)  PLEASE BUY THIS BOOK, YOU WON´T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!

B004XNGKBS|4.0|Solid design, doesn't fall apart, tough to get used to on a phone (not that that's their fault), but the price point is a bit too steep. Given that I got this as the free app of the day, I have no complaints. ;)
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|Enjoy!- Trucks plays the slide guitar about as close to the human voice articulation as I have ever heard-so impressed by the melodic intervallic inflections that I am incorporating into my piano riffs  Highly recommend the CD as well for the wonderfully dynamic, yet soothing vocals of Tedeschi-her phrasing is very original and musical  At last, an organic band with real players all excellent musicians-no filler, additives or preservatives here   Check out 'these walls'-poignant and descriptive-  'Learn how to love' -great groove, vocals and solos by Trucks
B004XJHBCE|4.0|I will typically try out organizing utility apps as they become available, so when FolderOrganzier was Amazon's FAOTD, I downloaded it.  I categorized all my existing apps, and I categorize all new apps as I download them.    I use FolderOrganizer in conjunction with my homescreen replacement to display my apps in groups.  FolderOrganizer is great for several reasons.  First, the folders automatically gain or lose shortcuts as I change categories for apps within FO.  FO also allows me to change the icons associated with apps, providing enhanced customization.  FO also permits shortcuts (like direct dial links) and bookmarks to be included in categories alongside apps.  An impressive organizational tool!
B0018CMJSU|5.0|To begin with, you have a trilogy with two classic films and a very under-rated third.  On top of that, the films are beautifully remastered and look amazing!  Plus you get all of the extras from the previous DVD box set.  I may have to buy this again on Blu Ray when I can afford the player and an LCD TV.
B005GYY0GA|5.0|The title of this release is somewhat of a misnomer; there were considerably more influences on Johnny.  But, for a single \\"album\\", the songs truly represent some of his most influential.  His collaborations are well chosen and contains a few surprises (Vince Gill, for one).  It's great to see a new release after so many years (compilations excluded); I hope to see many, many more!
0763619612|5.0|I bought this book for an art lesson. It was a great lesson for all my kiddos about being an artest.  I used it for a  painting lesson on negagtive space and a dot collage for my kindergarten. Love this story!
B005PKLKS6|5.0|As we know, Skyler and Walt have a ton of money in their crawl space.  However, they are both so involved with their own crises that they are both relying on that money without talking to one another about using it.  Skyler is still trying to force her former boss into paying the IRS so that she isn't pulled into his audit. Her former boss has gotten incredibly greedy and that greed is making him stupid when it comes to this couple.<br /><br />Walt meanwhile is trying to stay alive now that Jesse is becoming Gus's Number One guy. Of course no one should be getting closer with Gus but Gus and Mike pulled Jesse out of the fire when he was falling apart so he was vulnerable. Really, you wonder how anyone manages to still be alive from one episode to the next.  That scene from an earlier episode of this season, when Walt is waiting for a scan with another cancer patient, keeps repeating in my head.  Walt got into all of this because of his cancer.  Now he can scarcely even think about the cancer since it is a miracle he is alive from the Gus menace one day after another.<br /><br />Mortality is infinitely closer when you are part of a drug cartel, much closer than with cancer, as even with cancer you have the next 24 hours sewn up if you are still walking around with it. It keeps replaying in my head, Walt's telling the other cancer patient that the cancer barely registers in his mind anymore.  Walt's life has become like one constant, unceasing scream.
B00004YX39|4.0|If you're a true Dan fan, I can't see how Gaucho can disappoint. The lyrics, the chords, the maddening attention to detail, it's all here. I suggest that anyone who is interested check out the Steely Dan bio by Brian Sweet, the stories and facts about the making of this album will illuminate and no doubt deepen your appreciation for what these guys were trying to accomplish. Roger Nichols basically invented the modern drum machine during the making of this album. Amazing stuff.    However If you've never heard the pieces that were unfinished or abandoned during these sessions, you simply must. \\"The Second Arrangement\\" is a downright amazing song that could have been one of their biggest hits in my opinion. There is a relatively famous story behind it that explains it's omission from the album.    Then there is the \\"The Bear\\" which is at once interminably funky and beautifully mysterious, with some of their strangest lyrics:   Drive the coach and six for the county line  Point me towards the tube and I'll be just fine  Mr. Quick has flown from the cosmic zoo  Someone must be him and I just found you  And thirdly \\"Kulee Baba\\", which tells the story of a hapless TV production crew on location in the bush who become crazed participants in some native ritual. A song only Becker and Fagen would write, full of detail and humor. Rick Marotta played drums on it and loved it. Indeed, it's one of my favorite Dan tunes.  There are a few other songs that they were working on such as \\"Talkin' About My Home\\" and \\"I Can't Write Home About You\\" that might not have fit well with the rest of Gaucho but are excellent regardless.  My point being is that once you've heard the aforementioned tunes, one can only fantasize about what could have been. I swear they are that good. Take \\"My Rival\\" off and put \\"The Second Arr.\\" and \\"Kulee Baba\\" on there and you've got an album as strong as any other of theirs.   As it is though Gaucho is an achievement many would be endlessly proud of it, and rightfully so. I gave it 4 stars only because I think \\"The Royal Scam\\" and \\"Aja\\" are all-around stronger.
B005DD7H50|3.0|This may have made a better tv episode of something for an hour because the movie doesn't know what to do with itself in the second half.  We have everything we need to know and understand happen in the first half.  The rest just meanders with that same material.  Our lead character takes a super drug which lights up the dormant part of his brain so that he is using all of his brain all of the time.The hitch is that you have to keep taking the drug.  He inherited the stash of his late, murdered brother-in-law.) But while he is taking it, he becomes fabulously rich and increasingly powerful.<br /><br />This is very slick, stylish and visually beautiful for the first hour and then that aspect is exhausted.  Unfortunately, the remainder of the movie becomes the standard action flick with the hero trying to stay alive as various unsavory characters want the drug.  I think if the lead had been made into a scientist, who decided to experiment on himself with his own new drug, this would have been more believable.  It is scarcely believable that his scraping along brother-in-law had his own huge stash of the drug laying around and that no one else knows about this drug.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Changes happen people get over it, this set is the most impressive visual tour de force in the short history of the blu ray medium. The six films have not looked better ever and as such should be considered a must buy.
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|I remember watching the original Tron and being amazed at the visuals.  This time around I was better prepared and still found the visuals stunning.  The story was good, although there were a few strange plot holes, the story was nonetheless enjoyable.  On my 50\\" plasma the colors really popped and the special effects were great.  The special features were okay, but there wasn't a lot to look at there. My only criticism is that I buy discs in part for the special features and not getting much is a bit of a letdown.  Otherwise, it was a good buy for me.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing this DVD for awhile. It was effective before I had my 3 yr old twins and helped me get back into shape after too.  It is the shortest work out I have found with the bet results. I have only been able to do Sessions 1 & 2. If I get really ambitious I'm sure I could do 3 but I see the results I need from the others. I usually work out 5-6 days a week, running and have been doing marathons. However, lately with the twins, work and school I have very little time but do what I need to do. Usually 3 or 4 days a week and sometimes more. I you don't have much time this is a great fitness routine but you still need to be consistent and finish the entire workout to see results. My only complaint is that I hate when the instructor is talking and standing idle while the 2 women in the background do all the work (& me too for that matter). Must be noted, I tend to not always be in the best mood during the workout. ;) Nonetheless Jillian looks great & it works!
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Finally, after a slow decade and nothing fresh, Anthrax's Worship Music album puts back Anthrax right back on track s \\"the Big 4\\" metal kings of the East! Lyrics, power, creativity, fuller guitar solos and amazing drum work from \\"Chuck\\" Benante. Joey Belladonna's vocals only gets better with time and we see him for the first time with a different slower style. I loved it and I cannot stop listening to it! Anthrax Rocks harder than ever!  Anthrax needed an album like that and so did we - the true Anthrax fana!!! Thank you!
B0050SYS5A|2.0|Ok, so lets start with the pros:  1) Yes as promissed it blends nicely with the Kinect camera  2) Yes installation is easy enough.  3) It does cut down the distance needed considerably.  I needed only to be about 4ft from the camera to see it recognize me.  Cons:  1) Fidelity in controls are completely lost.  Trying to navigate any menu system was very frustraiting as my hand icon would skip around the screen.  crossing my hand over my body made it even worse.  2) I noticed the picture in picture view given by Kinect was severly reduced.  Previously it would show a shot of my whole living room & couch.  Now there was a weird dark ring around the outter edges of the camera view.   3) while it does cut down on how far you stand...it also cuts down considerably the front to back room you have.  So games that make you move front and back seem to struggle.  A game like Rise of Nightmares that worked well without the camera couldnt see my walking gesture with the lense on.  In fact it made the game unplayable.  Summary...yes it cuts down on the distance needed to be seen..but that is all the benefit you get.  Its downside of loss of fidelity and fine movement are far bigger than the gain.  I can't recommend this to anyone.  Save your $30 and buy a lazy susan swivel for your TV and just turn like I do to open up a more lengthy section of living room so I don't have to re-adjust my living room everytime I want to play.

B004XNGKBS|3.0|I used this for just a few minutes before deciding it doesn't help me. It works well, for the most part, although cursive writing turns out very sloppy. A stylus might help this. There may be circumstances in which I would want its ease of use. However, input is just as fast and more accurate on the Swype keyboard, so there is no particular advantage to me of using this as a note-taking app. Evernote combined with Swype works just as well for my purposes. I have drawing programs I can use to draw symbols and pictures if I need to.
B0055V0HXO|3.0|Count me among those who don't think that In A Perfect World is a step up from Karmakanic's last outing. Oh, there is a lot to like but overall their new effort is a very mixed bag. For all the hype, Karmakanic seems to have actually taken a step backward musically speaking.  First the good: 1969, the opening cut, is a fine tune strongly evocative of the Flower Kings. Can't Take It With You is an interesting blend of Latin rhythms and elements of heavy metal. There's Nothing Wrong With the World and Bite the Grit are the proggiest, best, and most interesting tracks on the album.  The mediocre: When the World Is Caving In starts weakly but occasionally exhibits flashes of brilliance. Both versions of Turn It Up are too commercial for me, although the unedited version is better with it's percussive introduction and driving keyboards.  The execrable: When Fear Came to Town is a weak piece that features insipid vocals that are followed by a pleasant but uninspired instrumental ending. This could have been left off the album and no one would have missed it.  OK, I haven't yet had the chance to view the video bonus track but I can't imagine that it could improve the rating of In A Perfect World.  The CD comes housed in a standard plastic jewel box and is accompanied by an attractive booklet that features pictures, lyrics, and all appropriate album information. This is an album I can take or leave. I will listen occasionally, but I imagine it will spend a lot of time on the shelf waiting for Karmakanic's next and hopefully better album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|So far, I'm enjoying the heck out of this game. It's deceptively simple, but complex enough to hold interest. I also dig meditative soundtrack.
B004L35GAQ|4.0|First listen of this album wasn't too spectacular, but a few songs really stand out.  Probably the most intoxicating and catchy is the track \\"Jump On My Shoulders\\"... why this wasn't the group's first single, I have no idea.  \\"Sail\\" was the first single, and while it is very original sounding and gives a cool vibe, it lacks the instant attraction of some of the other tracks.  Although it is very electronic in production, the songs themselves are completely pop/rock based which gives the album a much wider appeal.  Regardless of the sound, this is NOT a techno or dance album.  Continued listens reveal new gems (a LOT of work and thought went into the production), and as a whole, this album is worth definitely worth buying.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|'What are you doing?' IS to be taken literally!   The sound is fabulous - though your voice on certain tracks has a worrying 'lizzp' .. probably due to over-compression in the mix.  It's NOT Phil Ramone, - but with the slickness of a definite Tommy Lipuma. And:  What's with your voice, Diana?  You sound very tired and worn out - almost as if you only PRETEND to be 'jazzy'?   Your audience knows better. Don't underestimate us.  Some of the tracks are ok, but really, - with your record? - why bother?  The fact that 'I've grown Accustomed to her (his) Face' ever made its way OUT of the trash is a miracle!    Who ever wrote the arrangement obviously didn't like the song, because it's a mess!!  The chords and progressions used are stealing and unwinding the whole song and throwing it to the trash. (where it should have been immediately after orchestra rehearsal!)  Once such a beautiful song.   Please have someone - who LIKES the song and is COMPETENT - LISTEN to the recordings of the song by Nat Cole or Dean Martin, - and if it comes to a choice, always GO FOR NAT!!   Then your arranger will get the chords right, too, I hope.  'Everytime We Say Goodbye' sounds like you already died, Diana! Hope you didn't?  And the title: 'Quiet Nights' should (at least) have been: 'QUIET NIGHTS NO 34 -' as there are SOOO many albums out there called this.  I hope it'll make it even easier for this album to disappear in oblivion.  Except for portions of '...hang My Tears Out To Dry' - this album isn't at all necessary, and I'd rather have NOT heard it.   That, I'm really NOT 'Accustomed To' with (most) of your albums.  Still love you, Diana .... but the question here is: Do you?  Disappointing, but 'better tidings' next time!

B004XNGKBS|5.0|I just installed this on my Samsung Galaxy YP-G70 and it seems to work fine.  Not sure when or how I will use it.  Nice to get a free app that's unique and not a game, since most of the games seem to just be a variation of another game.  Update: Also installed and runs fine on Nook Color running CM7.
0439023491|5.0|Some of the best books I have ever read.  Kept me on the edge of my seat like no other.  Written so vividly that I felt I was a spectator.<br /><br />This is a series I am keeping in my library.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I really like the way that Hugh Laurie does New Orleans blues. Before he became the brilliant but difficult Dr. Gregory House on the television hit House M.D., he has been a legitimate keyboard and guitar musician for about 30 years. And he got to show off his abilities in his first music CD entitled \\"Let Them Talk,\\" which was just released in the US on September 5th.  This musical collection, which is taken mostly from the first half of the 1900's, seems to be a kind of labor of love for Hugh Laurie - a love for the blues genre and for those who perform it. He is not a blues singer, but he certainly puts his heart into each song, and he is a tremendously talented musician. The British born actor, author and comedian explains in the included picture booklet that he has followed New Orleans blues since he was a teenager, and it has deeply affected him ever since.  My favorite songs include \\"The Whale Has Swallowed Me,\\" which is a re-telling of the story of Jonah;  a  uniquely upbeat version of \\"Swanee River\\" which has a personal story behind it; and the beautiful romantic title song \\"Let Them Talk.\\"  But this album is my favorite because I enjoy so many more of the other songs.  His piano rendition of the old Louis Armstrong standard, \\"St. James Infirmary,\\" is incredibly good, especially when you turn up the volume. His \\"Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho\\" is both respectful and driven.  \\"Tipitina,\\" a song that is delightfully representative of the New Orleans sound with its complicated syncopation, is quite faithful to the original by Professor Longhair. The great Lead Belly's song \\"You Don't Know My Mind\\" was rearranged with a few new lyrics into a really catchy tune. Sir Tom Jones was featured in a song from the 1920's called \\"Baby Please Make a Change,\\" and New Orleans Blues Queen Irma Thomas is wonderfully showcased in her irresistibly toe-tapping version of \\"John Henry.\\"  And that is Hugh Laurie working wonders on the piano behind his musical hero,  Dr. John, inthe classic love song \\"After You've Gone\\" - talk about legitimate New Orleans \\"cred\\", Dr. John let him play for him!    As a testimony to the high quality of this performance, the CD debuted in the US at #1 on Billboard's Blues Album Chart and at #16 on its Hot 100 Album chart.  There will also be a documentary on PBS on September 30th about his trip to New Orleans, and his experiences while meeting and working with some of the greatest American musicians there, including the great Allen Toussaint.  Those who have not heard his music should not expect a \\"dainty\\" British accent. Hugh sings all of his songs with a perfect House-like American accent.  I have enjoyed it all summer long because it was released in Europe last May, and it has already reached the top ten on several music charts there. It's just THAT good.
0316098329|4.0|This was a VERY unusual book but could very well happen today in these abuse/kidnap situations.  Really made you want to continue with the books to see how they dealt with their \\"solitude.\\"  I high recommend the book.
B0035V35P8|5.0|What a movie,this is a must see!  The action is so detailed,way up spectacular!  I had no idea what i was in for,the first time i've viewed it when it came out,now seeing it for the second time,all the action,car chashes,bloody fights,and i mean bloody,the whipping of the chained knife,and more the ninjas popping in and out of the dark,  not knowing when they will appear,all seems so fresh.   one of the best scenes,and there are many, was when Raizo was chased down the street in heavy traffic by one of the warriors,ok the hole car chase scene from the beinging! fast action thru out the film.  I injoyed the action,and relationship between Raizo,and the two female characters,from when Raizo was a child all the way up to when he meets female agent(Naomie Harris)which was in 28 Days Later,and Miami Vice Movie.  The back ground colors,were all done very well to pull you into the movie action,and the characters atmosphere.   You won't go wrong buying this collectable movie,you won't!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I waited a good month and some change before I gave my thoughts on this board. Gigabyte gave you the perfect combo of price/performance with this baby. The quality is excellent, two x16 PCIe slots, USB 3.0...you guys already know the run down. There's not much to be said that hasn't already been said.  Gigabyte advises that if you do not experience problems with the BIOS, do not update it. I didn't listen to them. I updated it and everything's still running smoothly.  I miss the IDE and floppy connectors, but that's my only complaint, and I knew what I was getting when I made my purchase, so it's not really a complaint, but a nostalgic wish.  I highly recommend this board for any AMD users who wish to take advantage of bulldozer technology when it's released this coming October!  5 Stars!
B005NA3B8U|5.0|The game is fun but the icon looks like a penis so it's awkward having it on your home screen.
B000VRITM8|5.0|I used to listen to What Game Shall We Play Today back in 1977.  I never knew the name of the song or the amazing singer with the latin accent.  After hearing the song in my head for over thirty years, I managed to locate it on Amazon a few weeks ago (wonderful benefits of modern technology).  I love Flora Purim's voice, and the lyrics are beautiful.  I am not a huge jazz fan, but I listen to this song over and over.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Lady Gaga has done it again. This album has everything from dance to rock ballads. Each song offers something different for every listener. If you feel like getting up and dancing, put on \\"Born This Way.\\" If you need a song to mellow out to, play \\"Bloody Mary.\\" I've had this album since the day it came out, and it hasn't left my music player since. Another plus is that you get so much music for the price. It is so rare to get a full album these days.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|wish it would let you write a little faster. seems to take a few seconds before what u write appears. overall... very nice.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I was first introduced to Adele on XM Satellite with the song Chasing Pavements. I have loved it ever since.
