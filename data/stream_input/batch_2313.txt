0812992784|5.0|I have remarks to make about love, which is not Salman Rushdie's strength, and hate, which is his area of refined expertise. They, love and hate, share the concept of \\"intolerance\\". So above all he can write his quarter of a million words on that word \\"intolerance\\". When near the end of the memoir he is introduced to Meg Ryan, her fascination with celebrity Eastern avatarism is a total turnoff; he can't tolerate a religious woman. At the same time this vixen succubus of a woman, Padma, is a woman he \\"loves\\". Not that any marriage to Meg Ryan would have worked either, but Salman Rushdie is a guru of gurus in the artistic expression sphere, to include at least 100 other writers he dines with throughout the book, friends most of them, and a complete novice when it comes to loving the one you are with. Unfortunately, the second association I always have to make with Salman Rushdie is that of a little boy on the experimental side of puberty. Every time he discusses his marriages, his literature sinks to something I would have written in my early twenties.<br /> But the first association is head and shoulders above the second, and head and shoulders above the common writer's inspirational methods. I greatly enjoyed reading about the moments, such as mountain climbing in Australia in 1984, that became a piece of the The Satanic Verses puzzle. Plus the actual hijacking of a plane in 1985, a plane that then exploded just like the one that begins the novel. Pamela Lovelace is Clarissa. There is a family connection to South America, just like the one I vaguely remember from the novel. But I also remember the police brutality of the British police force. \\"Joe\\" Anton does have to reconcile that treatment with the protection Scotland Yard afforded him for about nine years after that Valentine's Day of 1989. His biggest complaints about that pseudonym  experience involve over-protection, that his British security force was somehow to blame for doing its job when Rushdie wanted todine with Harold Pinter or accept an award in Vienna. Rushdie does not fully recognize the scapegoat he's made of the efforts that were costing the nation a fortune because the nation itself did not immediately go on record. In fact Tony Blair appears only slightly more literate than George Bush would have, and Margaret Thatcher is a dumb Ronald Reagan.<br /> Roald Dahl, for the record, is a writer critical of Rushdie. Another critic was the author of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Susan Sontag comes to his aid. And then there is Christopher Hitchens, a man killed by cancer after the book's timeline, in a book of friends already killed by cancer, including Clarissa. William Styron is immortalized as a creepy old man at Martha's Vineyard, not to mention as Bill Clinton's crony, and Philip Roth gets more mentions than anybody could have without ever physically appearing in a scene.<br /> He is not alone, but the nugget of Cat Stevens could be the most interesting character in the memoir. On page 178 \\"Yusuf Islam\\" is on TV \\"hoping for [Rushdie's] death and stating that he would be prepared to call in the hit squads if he learned of the blasphemer's whereabouts\\". Stevens must be part of Shalimar the Clown, a study of violent and sudden brainwashing. Later it is noted that the Ayatollah Sanei issued the fatwa, not the more famous Khomeini. At its highest point, the reward was $3.5 million. I would now like to read If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, referenced on page 351. Thomas Pynchon is a \\"God\\" for Rushdie, and Gravity's Rainbow would be His word. U2's place in the memoir belongs only to Bono, admirer of The Jaguar Smile, who did not have groupies at concerts and introduced Rushdie at Earl's Court and then again at Wembley (events I would never forget, but also not remember exactly as they happened).<br /> On page 609, Joseph Anton has no good answer to the question, \\"Who have you ever made happy?\\" We need his sequel. Instead of a man whose driving purpose is to make people think about how to be tolerant enough to escape third world oppression, we now need a writer who can make his personal life big enough not just to protest Medieval methods of hate, but a writer who can teach us the finer points beyond those of protest.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|For a film written, produced and starring the same man, he could have asked for help along the way. It has the '70s feel of a Kung- Fu film, without the cheesy dialog and bad lipsynk. Worth having over a few friends who would not pay for this themselves, firing up the Grill and cracking open a few cold ones and laughing.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The story about gaeas and the giants are great plus Mr.D is great with parties however the ending is not that great because it ends all the sudden because is mostly a continuation in the next book waiting for it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is for you. Only wish is that the boards increased above 14 x 14, highly addictive.....trust your instincts...
B004T2QZL8|3.0|On my kindle fire hd the game would crash at the home screen or at the intro to the game. I've played this game on my computer and its really fun but be warned that it could crash if you have a kindle fire hd.

B008Y73940|4.0|Thought this was a fair movie, liked the twist on the killer of his friend. I don't watch movies to often and only for enjoyment, not to get something out of them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed this series when it first came on Fox, but in subsequent re-runs on the sci-fi channel I became hooked.  I wish the networks would keep the good shows like this and get rid of all the other crap out there!
030758836X|4.0|Good mystery.  Well written and keeps you reading.  I read it very fast.  Try it you'll like it if your a mystery buff.
B001JRB16U|5.0|They don't make cartoons like this anymore. Great story line and animations. Just think, this was before computers and poeple relied on them so much to do their thinking for them,
B0014D6PCO|1.0|This is thye third time ordring a video from amazon and having profound problems with the video freezing, voice cutting in and out and a blank screen. Just cannot enjoy a movie this way... Get your act together Amazon or get out of the video rental business.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|As some have already started this book I a lot of filler.  That however does not make it a bad read.  It's still enjoyable but in the end the cliff hanger leave you dying for more.

B003MC5N28|5.0|This is the absolute best book ever made. No book comes close to what The Giver is. This book provides true emotions. You must read this book.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is by far the best in the Hungry Shark series! Great graphics and easy to use controls. All in all, best game I have played in a long time! Way to go FGOL!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This series has it all. Political corruption, redemption, the evils we endure etc.  It is gritty and it isn't light on the realities of the atrocities humans are capable of. A must read for all fans of this genre.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Love the game...can't put it down...family will just have to wait for supper...Awesome graphics...story line interesting...have to find out what happens next

0446580848|2.0|I love Nelson DeMille.  I have read all his books and they have all been witty, action packed reads - leaving me wanting more.  This book was a huge disappointment.  625 pages, lots of wise cracking and not a lot of story.  No twists, no rich wonderful details - or anything.  The story didn't build to a satisfying conclusion and could easily have been have the number of pages.  The first disappointment for us from Nelson DeMille

B00B0NDF26|5.0|My wife and I were listening to some Tegan and Sara and decided we wanted to go on a T&S binge! So we bought 'Sainthood', 'This Business of Art', 'If It Was You', 'The Con', and 'So Jealous'. Then shortly after, Amazon had a one day special on their newest, 'Heartthrob' for $2.99, and we added that. We like listening to them on shuffle and hearing their different styles mixed together. You can hear different influences, but T&G always have great harmony, lyrics and bounce that are all their own. This is fun alt-pop that also has depth and heart. 'Heartthrob' has a richer sound than some of their previous CDs, but is a nice progression from previous work and adds to their range. Make Tegan and Sara a part of your musical life!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome! i love connecting with my friends and building houses! it seems like a lot of money, but its so worth it!
B00BNYCFNM|4.0|Big Big Train has released their sequel album English Electric Part II...it was worth the wait. From the moment the album starts with East Coast Racer it sucks you in. Big Big Train creates songs which reflect a bygone way of English life. From East Coast Racer which is about a famous British steam locomotive to Swan Hunter which is about life in a ship building yard....the music is sweeping. Progressive Rock is alive and well with Big Big Train. They can remind you a bit of Genesis, Jethro Tull or even XTC....which makes sense since Dave Gregory used to be with them. The song that is the most powerful for me is the Curator of Butterflies.....it is maybe Big Big Trains version of Genesis Ripples. These guys are here to stay and have now left a big mark in Prog rock. Both English Electric part I and part II should be on any progressive rock listeners list. If I had to choose which one is better....a slight edge goes to English Electric part I. But not by much...It is good to see that a new generation has taken up the reins for progressive rock..bands like The Watch, Porcupine Tree, Flowerkings, Cirrus Bay, RPWL....and of course Big Big Train.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I love the Pitch Perfect CD and the<br />Movie also. I loved that they did Miley's<br />&#34;Party In The U.S.A.&#34; From the movie<br />I'd cut out the throw up scenes that<br />was 100% disqusting. (There were<br />3 scenes like that)
B00845PT18|1.0|Great Graphics, horrible plot. I was really disappointed I wasted $10 on this movie, but I made myself finish it.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I think this game is fun it keeps you wanting more. It's a addicting game the more you learn and win the harder you want the card challenge.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Granted it took me a little while to warm up to the settings.  But thankfully Kate does a wonderful job of twirling you in rapidly (just when you think it might not take off like you thought) so that it becomes hard to put the book down!<br />I love all of Kate's books. This one was quite whimsical and truly romantic. Beautiful bitter sweet ending.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was reading \\"lol\\" in the text. I didn't feel that the use of the modern day, short form of texting laughter really belonged. I found it distracting when used.<br />Otherwise I had a delightful read.<br /><br />Thank you, Kate.  I look forward to your next book!
B00355L2TU|5.0|Jillian Michaels definitely gets you sweating and one can see the results when consistent with the routine. Highly recommended video.
B005SCSL56|5.0|This is a book that will have you thinking of fairy tales in a whole new way! I thought it was a really good book of two kids finding out about where there father was raised and having an adventure it had some really good twists in their too!
B00BOLE7X0|3.0|The movie was just OK for me. I know they were trying to be as accurate in all ways as possible but the lighting was so dim it was difficult to see the actors and the action. With all the hype I have to say I expected more. Probably won't be one I'll watch over and over.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig is by far the best Bond. His character is deep and complex compared to the older Bond movies. Theme song by Adele is excellent.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|It is a GOOD movie albeit I don't think many people would really get into it.  None-the-less, I found it very realistic and believable.  Even the explosions were realistic instead of the typical Hollywood &#34;nuclear&#34; hand grenade.  I t was slow paced but then the real event took about 10 years.  I doubt my wife or a typical date would enjoy it but for a day at home alone it was a GOOD movie.  It is not easy to follow so you have to pay attention...no running to the fridge or you'll miss something.  It also portrays classic bureaucratic infighting that shames the US government.  All I can say more is &#34;Go Girl!  Follow your training, education and experience!&#34;
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this series. My new favorite books. Gonna read them again right now lol every woman should read these books lol
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I am usually very hesitant about films that do so well in the Academy Awards since they nearly always fall into an artsy category that few would actually be able to enjoy. I can say that this film is among my current favorites for it's excellent storytelling techniques, marvelous acting by all, and excellent timing. I recommend this film for anyone who is insterested in learning a bit more about this era, politics, and Lincoln in general.
B004YXE438|5.0|This is better than working the old fashioned puzzles I'm a beginner and even the easy option is a challenge for me but not impossible I really love it a nd the pictures are beautiful
1455523550|5.0|This isn't just one of Nicholas Spark's typical sappy love stories that he tends to write. Yes, it does involve two people falling in love in beautiful North Carolina, but it involves an unexpected twist involving danger, love, dedication to the family, and escaping from the past.<br /><br />There are so many layers that keeps you hooked till the very end. I wasn't able to put this book down. \\"Safe Haven\\" does an amazing job at keeping your attention to the very end and making sure there is no dull, slow to follow part.<br /><br />This tale of survival will keep you on your toes, not knowing what will happen next. Between internal conflict, ghosts from the past (literally), and of course, love, you will not be disappointed by this riveting story.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks has always been my favorite author, but this book shines a new light on ways that I want to change about myself that I didn't know before. I was inspired to take hold of my own life and become who I truly want to be. This book gives you hope and shows how forgiveness and love can completely change ones life around.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this has been the best book I have read and I am determined to read all of Nicholas Spark's books in the future!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Pros:<br />-Not Bulky<br />-Sleep/Wake works perfectly all the time<br />-Nice, high quality feel<br />-Protects device<br />-Stand is excellent, watching movies/videos etc is excellent<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Orientation is complicated with camera<br /><br />Overall:<br />Would highly recommend this product because of its functionality and price.
0307352153|4.0|Susan Cain sheds light on the quiet and reserved world of the introvert through a broad view of history, research, science, genetics, as well as personal experience.  As a good portion of the world is made up of introverts and I am an extreme extrovert I found the book excellent in helping me gain understanding as to how they work best, communicate most effectively, and perceive their environment in general.  I think she makes some excellent points as to the importance and great contributions introverts have and can make when given the opportunity.  I think it is also a fair point that being quiet is okay and group work has gone much too far at work and in the school system.<br />Parents of introverted children will find the later part of the book especially helpful as she gives tips and recommendations on how to raise and nurture such a child in a world that places so much value on being an extrovert.  Additionally anyone doing business in Asia or Africa (very introvert style cultures) might gain greater insight into why negotiations and communication have gone the way they have and how that can be improved.  i would not hesitate to recommend this book to any working professional or parent.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It is not the usual Bond, but a great reboot introducing new characters!  Definitely a highlight to the Bond canon!
B005LAIIQC|4.0|The product came safe and sound and not bad for a used product. As for the movie , Jeremy is a very good actor and he lived up to his name in the movie, but there was expert tracking and there was no presence of the real Jason Bourne , they both could easily fit in the movie. But somehow the directors thought otherwise. Anyways it was a good movie and maybe I am being too fanboyish.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|I was a very interesting movie, slightly slower than the others tho.  I would watch agin if i was very bored.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|A couple of years ago I was working with a local DJ who absolutely loves Bowie, a real fan. She told me that she knew he still had it and could deliver a great album and great music again, any time. I kinda chuckled and said that I thought he was retired. At the time I felt he had earned it. We had seen him in concert shortly before his emergency surgery. He looked and sounded great and I'm sure his health problems shocked the hell out of him.......I'm sure I wasn't the only one that thought he was through.<br /><br />Anyway, here we are with this new album, ten years down the road and I'm wrong again. He delivered.......Everybody's got an opinion on what his best is.....and I say, come on now. Not many artists can take a ten year hiatus and come back with a work of art like this. This is art, and it's entertaining. He's got such a great imagination and like all of his art there are some stunning moments. Even though he's still in outer space he's come back down to walk the dead. Like most artists, he has a fear of death and wonder of life and it permeates his music with mystery and adventure but now it's for real and he is rocking on....dig it. Later we die....<br /><br />A word about Tony Visconti. I think he is one of the greatest producers, ever. His work with Bowie, and Alejandro Escovedo, and Morrissey and others is terrific. He doesn't get in the way of the artist and brings out their best. He's done it here again. Bowie has surrounded himself with some fantastic musicians on this one, like all of his albums. Love the cover and Bowie's street tough survivor look on the portrait inside...<br /><br />There are a lot of good reviews here, check 'em out. I'm glad Bowie returned........enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An amazing game, one of the best games ever. I loved it and can't stop playing it, it's so addictive
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Finding great family movies for everyone to watch when you have kids around 8-10 years are hard these days, but if them have the studio DreamWorks on them, that's a sign of quality. Their latest run of release is only rivaled by Pixar. This and &#34;How to Tain your Dragon&#34; have been a couple of the best movies ( not just family animation genre) that we've seen in a long time. I highly recommend it and its great purchasing on the Amazon on demand. It always available on our iPad or Xbox, I'm starting to love the convenience and pricing of the movies on Amazon, and having them in movie collection, and it everywhere you go. Very cool

B00005TQKQ|5.0|I was having problems with old 8mm tapes clogging the heads of my Sony TRV460 Digital 8 camcorder.  Several years ago I bought the Best Buy head cleaning tape, and had to return it.  It would not clean the heads.  The tape would not even run in the camcorder.  Since then, I have been cleaning the heads with alcohol.  This works, but it takes up to two hours for the alcohol to dry.  In the mean time, tapes will not run because of the moisture.  I ordered the Sony head cleaning tape, and found that it works as expected.
0307592731|1.0|I was so excited to read this book, and I was so, so let down. In fact, I'm confused about why so many people love this book so much.<br /><br />The writer was incredibly selfish, cruel, and hurtful to the people who loved her (I couldn't count how many people she said she cheated on her husband with). Nor could I tell exactly how she supposedly grew, or was \\"found,\\" on the trail, since she seems just as shallow and self-centered the entire time.<br /><br />In fact, much of the \\"hike\\" she completes without even hiking! She skips hundreds of miles because of snow, and at times she hitchhikes more than she hikes. I really don't see any aspect of this story in which she's not a cheater. I had great expectations with this book, but the whole way through, I myself felt cheated by it.
B0041KVX1A|2.0|I bought three of the new digitally mastered Beatles albums, and this one was a disappointment.  The music, of course, is great, but the quality of the recording is by no means good.  The other two albums, Abbey Road and Magical Mystery Tour, are excellent.  I have a better than average audio system, and recording and/or processing issues stand out  I would suggest getting an original copy off the internet, as many original vinyls are becoming available  everyday.

B002YCVX5S|4.0|Quentin Tarantino is one of those people you either love or hate. It's his unique stories and methodical attention to detail that have always stood out to me. For all you haters out there, the one thing you can't deny is Tarantino's unique ability to bring out the best in everyone he works with, and that is why many times, the cast members of his films earn Oscar nominations. Inglourious Basterds is another uniquely strange story that just works, because of Tarantino. As has become his signature, the story is broken up into seemingly unrelated stories that all come together in a terrific ending. The story centers around a group of Jewish-American soldiers in World War II, whose assignment was to go into France, undercover, and track down and slaughter Nazis. It's a terrific cast led by Brad Pitt, but to me he wasn't so much the star of this film, that honor belongs to Christopher Waltz, who in his first major role, did win the Oscar for best supporting actor. It's a strong story and a great film, but something bothered me about it. Inglourious Basterds is of course a fictional story, so the attention to detail, such as having everyone speaking in their native languages, seemed someone unnecessary to me. That combined with subtitles that moved at the speed of light, made the story somewhat hard for me to follow. That's why I watched it a few times before reviewing it. There is no denying that this is one hell of a story with another tremendous cast, that deserved every award that it's won, however Tarantino's attention to detail, usually a strength, did take away from the film, as a whole, and did make some parts difficult to follow.

B000JPRPAO|5.0|There isn't anything you can say wrong about this movie....... except maybe that it isn't long enough!  One of the most fun movies out there to watch over and over again!  Great!
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|The first part of the movie that deals with the research done by the CIA is awesome. Unfortunately when you watch the raid on Osama's it is almost pitch black so you cannot see the actual assault no matter how much you brighten the controls of your television, kinda of a buzz kill considering the actual raid is most important part of the movie. Only buy this dvd if you can adjust the brightness in your screen or you have a large flat screen television.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|While a reader might question the interest level of a plot that involves a paraplegic who wants to end his life, the reader would actually find a very compelling story with characters who are well-developed and believable.  The plot engages the reader immediately and the reader continues to invest in them until the end.  This is a well-written and poignant story that will leave the reader with much to think about long after the last page is read.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has created a unique quest for reward and justice set in the Wild West and Deep South America.<br /><br />\\"Django Unchained\\" presents two men who go against the norms of what may be expected of typical bounty hunters from 1858 with German dentist Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and slave Django (Jamie Foxx) becoming a formidable pair.<br /><br />The narrative has a straightforward flow and a distinctive facet to the plot is Django's search for his wife Broomhilda Von Shaft (Kerry Washington). Dr. Schultz makes easy work of bounty hunting and uses his cool head, good manners and clever business skills to help Django locate his wife.<br /><br />It is however the ability of both Django and Dr. Schultz to switch off their scene of decency to slip under the guard of plantation owners \\"Big Daddy\\" (Don Johnson) and the ruthless Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Candie's vicious treatment of slaves can unsettle emotions, which can cause the viewer to sit uneasy, and Django's and Dr. Schultz's ability to disconnect compassion contributes to the ferocity of some scenes.<br /><br />The film ends with just a few on their feet but the skills Dr. Schultz taught to Django allow for sharper wits to prevail during the most precarious of times.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

B00571F26Y|2.0|Interesting read at first.  I thought the idea that the actual wheat plant has changed so much may have validity and that may be true.  The end of the book lapses into advocating a completely carb free diet.  No specific scientific studies were done by the author such as in &#34;The China Study&#34;.  That being said, the book has made me cut WAY back on wheat and I will definitely be more choosy when I do eat it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow what a READ! I didn't want to put this book down. So many twist & turns & OMG moments! Holder is so wonderful & so believable. He's not over romantic or perfect like you get in some other books. SKY was a great character & she handle all the situations so well. Gosh I just loved this book!
B007L96VCY|5.0|It's Paul, a great continuation of his genius taken from The Beatles.  I also had this back in the day when it was just out.  I believe it was on an 8-track tape.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good light read. Has a fun twist at the end. Hoping the movie lives up to the book! Read if you enjoy N.Sparks
B001EBULU8|5.0|i love the acting  and the speach of the person playing Jesus.  it would of been nice to have close of lazarus being raised from the dead.  i will recommend everyone to see this movie.  The sound of the group prayers activated the anointing of<br />God in me.  I watch this movie at my quite times and sometime I go straight to the prayers.  thank you for having it.  SHALOM!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|An amazing book about a boy who comes from nothing attempt to win it all. A  classic good vs evil story in a setting so diverse the writer probably had trouble not adding his favorite video game settings. All in all a great book recommend to all- especially people who don't read frequently. This book will surely reel you in!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! It's great, but for your next update could you add redstone and maybe more mods like wolves?
B003NX75B8|4.0|A fun, intelligent, and heartfelt book about two high school buys both named Will Grayson. The fact two authors wrote this book added some interesting twists and I'm very curious about the collaboration, but it was entirely a successful venture for me.<br /><br />The secondary character entirely leap to life and you feel for each of them in their own unique awkwardness.<br /><br />My one quibble was an ending that betrayed the emotional honesty of the preceding chapters but those final chapters are set during a production of a musical so there is a certain sense that in the theatre, emotions are a bit heightened and idealized and sentimentalized, so it can be forgiven.
B00BKTFABE|2.0|At first it worked perfect. My friend and I took a picture and a video. It was perfect.  The next day I went to take a picture of me and my cousin and it said camera has stopped.  That happens every time I enter the app. Not recommended not even the free version.
B005DJREJS|5.0|This series if fun and relatable for many different age groups. The characters are well developed. Season 1 is much better than season 2.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|Love Depevhe Mode.  I've a vintage Depeche Mode fan.  My son, almost 10 years old, and his friends love the music, too.  Sitting on the couch, listening to Depeche Mode, are fans from age 9 through, well, vintage.  To me, a band that edures for decades & fans Just Can't Get Enough :-) is by definition fabulous!  Thank you so much to the band & all the creative work behind the scene, too.  So excited to take my son to see Depeche Mode live!
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|May be and indie movie but it's a great story of coming of age. Good for everyone. Watched it with my 15 and 13 year old daughters and they did learned a valuable lesson from it. Logan Lerman and Emma Watson did a great job. Not giving anything away for those who haven't seen it but I highly recommend it .
B0009VSB06|5.0|Works Great would recommend.  Great starter metal detector.  Its a lot of fun and easy to use and not to mention the excitement of finding lost things.
0060853980|5.0|I will admit that this book is not to everyones' taste, however this is one of the few books that I insist on having in hard copy in case I want to reread it again.
B00138H876|4.0|This is later Dylan work,  His earlier stuff from the 60's & early 70's is stronger in many ways.  A good listen, though.
0307346617|5.0|Intrigue, suspense, character development and (of course) Zombies.<br /><br />Don't judge the book by the upcoming movie because this is a totally different creature!<br /><br />This book is written as an account after the fact from a range of sources, while zombies are there what makes this book is the human factor and the plausibility of the human response to the outbreak.<br /><br />If you can suspend your disbelief in zombies for long enough to read this book it is an exceptionally good read!
B0018AM1YY|5.0|Niel Young is one of the best &#34;guitar rock&#34; stars and this collection has all of the requisite hits.  I can listen to this endlessly.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's nice to be able to have a calculator with u at all times without actually having one.  User friendly and very easy to use.
B006AX6ONI|3.0|Fans of Cuban will enjoy this...but there's not much there. Having watched him on Shark Tank and having been time and again impressed with his knowledge of both the technical AND commonsense aspects of business, I was somewhat disappointed to find that this book read like a series of motivational posters (or, I suppose, blog posts--as that is the source material here).  But because it doesn't promise to be a text book and it does deliver a BIT of Cuban's business genius, it merits a positive (if just barely) review.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a good app but u can't do much. Don't get me wrong it's fun, and is great experience fora person respecting one but I've seen better. GREAT GAME OVERALL!!!! ;)
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fun game so far..can see how it coupd get repetitive over time. Great graphics for a free game for sure
0486409511|5.0|Ive always wanted to be able to have some knowledge and be able to do copperplating,Im very glad i did.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever since the beginning of time. You can build anything you want to. Think updates should be more often. Still the best game ever get it.
0345531957|3.0|This is a highly captivating story of a fugitive finally nabbed for stealing upwards of 90 mil from his former law firm. He is picked up in Brazil, tortured, and returned to the U.S. accused of several crimes. The story unravels and the reader learns about its many twists and turns, some believable, others not so much. The book is great, 5 *, up till the last chapter. The ending is a non-sequitur and leaves the reader thoroughly confused. My advice for any reader - do read this book but be prepared to skip the ending and make up your own.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Baldacci knows how to hold a readers interest. Book is very practical and I loved the tenacious spirit of the heroine... A great read!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The fledgling Republican Party formed to abolish slavery in 1854, led by the first Republican President, in an all-out effort to ammend the US Constitution and irrevocably end slavery in the United States. Lincoln is a behind the scenes look at how a man who had overcome poverty and hardship of his frontier childhood, led our nation though tremendous conflict to do what was right.

1451695195|5.0|As a young woman I longed to have faith in God, but despite investigating several different houses of worship and praying for faith, I could not believe in the Bible or in a God who would murder whole populations or demand a father kill his child, or cause intense suffering in a faithful believer just to \\"test\\" him.  Ministers would dodge my pointed questions, adding to the feeling that religion was just made up by (mostly) men wishing to control the simple-minded and further their own agendas.  That there was \\"something\\" out there, I was certain, but beyond that I was lost.  Thirty years pass.<br /><br />Enter Dr. Alexander's book.  I too am a physician with family of origin abandonment issues so his book seemed to speak to me directly, honestly, lovingly.  His restrained sense of urgency in educating us on the unimagineable vastness and goodness of the universe was touching and inspiring.  His absolute sincerity and wonderful skill in telling his story touched me very deeply.  I finished the book in one setting and wept upon finishing it.  I felt belief in God and a loving universe securely for the first time in my life.  His words felt like Truth.  For those of us driven to discover the \\"meaning of life\\", this book is invaluable.  Thank you Dr. Alexander for your meticulous recounting and evaluation of your experiences, at the risk of opening yourself to ridicule, for the benefit of us all.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My children enjoy this game, it's a simple counting game for young children. Interactive activities help them learn the relationship between objects and numbers.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|One of the best murder mysteries I've ever read.  Started it on a break at work one day and had to go right home after work to stay up late to finish it.  Some of the scenes are so vivid and well-written that my heart was literally racing.  Like all mysteries there are a few minor inconsistencies and the plot goes a bit over the top especially toward the end, but by then I'd been won over by the characters and didn't mind that the story was becoming implausible.<br /><br />This is my first Jo Nesbo book (it was recommended by a reviewer from TIME magazine) and I'm looking forward to reading many more!  Really excellent, highly recommended!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|The kids love this little game. They get feel like they are truly making a meal like me for their cute little friends! Helps them learn about steps in the cooking process and learn how to clean up after eating!
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|ARGO, directed by and starring Ben Affleck, receiving rave reviews all across the board, has the makings of a great story - not only because it's a true one.<br /><br />Declassified by the CIA since the nineties, dealing with the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, it's not the Embassy hostages we're centering on. There were six people who stealthily escaped the takeover, hiding in the Canadian ambassador's house. The CIA is at a loss - they have only one idea concerning bicycles and it's not very bright.<br /><br />Enter Affleck's Tony Mendez: we first see him waking up with an empty beer can on his dresser, so he's got the makings of the typical maverick hero. While watching BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES on TV, Tony has an idea - become a producer of a bogus science fiction movie and, scouting a location in Iran, get the Americans out.<br /><br />A fantastic premise and an opportunity to blend classic cult films with a modern thriller... And with John Goodman (as a makeup artist) and Alan Arkin (as a wry producer) on board the Hollywood end, ARGO just can't miss... but it does. The six people that need saving have zero personality, making it hard to feel for their plight.<br /><br />Although we see clips of hangings and executions in Iran, there's hardly a vibe of impending danger or threat. While the clever aspects, mixing a fake press conference for the sci-fi flick with Iranians making real demands, are edited nicely, the movie-making scheme, which had so much potential, feels rushed. And Affleck himself lacks the edge of a central character, much less a heroic one.<br /><br />The best part is the last half hour as the seven (including Mendez), using fake passports as a Canadian production crew, move through an Iranian airport for the departing plane. Despite every \\"last minute\\" clich&eacute; thrown in the pot, as least there's some urgency. But with a lack of interesting or involving characters leading to the escape, ARGO falls short of the immense hype.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|If you're 40 or over, there are parts of this film that will make you uncomfortable.  It's simply too good of a description of a marriage that has aged and the people who are stuck in it, still in love but not sure how to move their relationship forward.  There are plenty of laughs in this movie, although you will see most of them coming from a long way off.  I think this movie made my spouse uncomfortable, simply because it hit close to home.  Definitely worth seeing, just be prepared for the follow up conversations.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|What can I say?  It's alright, nothing special.  If you are a kid, you'll love it, most probably.  I am not.  So . . . eh. . . it's OK!
B00BLGZDYA|3.0|Half the fun of watching an abstract movie is trying to figure out what the artist was trying to say.  It took a couple of hours of discussion for my family and I to forge a theory about this movie, and even then we couldn't be even remotely sure that we were in the ballpark.  There is some innovative thinking in this movie, but there is also some stupid imagery from a college film (like cars talking while their taillights flash?  Seriously, would an anthropomorphic car really flash its taillights in tandem to its speech?)  All in all, it was just okay.  It's worth watching if you have some time to kill and are high, I think.
1451695195|5.0|Emotionally and intellectually satisfying because he explains in detail his family dynamic and the scientific reasoning behind his illness that justified his spiritual experience.
B00005O3VD|5.0|I love Barbra S. great movie and funny, very delightful . I would recommend to anyone. Please try it an share .
B000HKYOK0|5.0|This is a classics with Captain Pike and all the great early Star Trek shows, watched them many years ago when Star Trek first came out, back in the 60's. Never get tired of them and with today's new Star Trek starting up again with a new time line you can compare some of what was to what has changed in the time line.<br />If you didn't grow up with Star Trek you need to watch and see what was.  There are some real funny shows that will bust your gut, others that show you how leading edge they were with social issues and the possible technology, how Gene Roddenberry believed it would be.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Good quality product. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Well worth the money when it comes to meeting your needs. This is a MUST BUY!

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Incredible story and so well written.  Especially meaningful to me since my father also fought as a German soldier in WWII and, prior to his death, described many similar scenes that he experienced as Franz describes in this book.  Wonderful book!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|This is lame. I cant believe they added that stupid reward system with the Fruit Ninja and Amazon doesn't have.gustus cart like the Apple version doesn't. I would be Happy to edit and Change my review after an update but until then this game sucks. On Kindle<br />ONLY GET FREE VERSION
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I have spent hours upon hours playing this game.  The &#34;story&#34; is a bit silly, but you can't really expect much different from a Space Invaders/Galaga clone.  I learned really quickly that some weapon upgrades were way better than others.  Really glad that I picked this one up.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great game. Its Like Modern Warfare 3 But for Tablets. Think the Service could be better though. 5 star game.
B0012UNWJ8|5.0|Great family movie with great message.<br />We need more movies of this type that families can watch together.<br />Feel good movie.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Kik is great and works awesome for me. it is obviously way faster then any other texting app or phone service. The only thing it needs to get 5 stars is 1.Ability to send videos 2. Ability to view your account in the App (Kindle Fire HD) 3.Ability to delete individual messages.
B00BOLE7X0|1.0|Having trouble sleeping? rent/buy this movie! One of the most OVER RATED BORING movies I have ever watched!...Paint DRYING...Grass Growing....and watching C-SPAN are better and free!!...DDL won the best actor for this? WHY?

B0036S4C6G|1.0|I would rank this book in the top 5 of the worst books I've read.  There wasn't a character worth caring about or caring what happened to him/her.  The story was unnecesarily confusing.  I can't imagine why Egan won a Pulitizer Prize for it.  I think I have some old high school stories I've written that maybe I should submit for a prize.  The only reason I finished it is it was my book club's selection for March and I wanted to be able to participate in the discussion.  The interesting thing is that of the 9 people there that evening, only 2 thought it was good and they are both psychiatrist.  Ummm ... don't know what that means.  However, if the Goon Squad was a metaphor for the Death Squad, it couldn't come soon enough for me.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book was great. It had up to date definitions and it was very clear. It waas very easy to understand.
B000HZD168|5.0|Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a must see for any Trekkie that grew up watching the original TV series. The character Khan Noonien Singh (played by Ricardo Montalban), first appeared in the original series episode &#34;Space Seed&#34; (1967).
B00A820UH8|1.0|I decided to purchase the Kindle version since the price dropped significantly and the hardcover is out of stock (perhaps even out of print). Unfortunately, the presentation of it was not well thought out. The book utilizes a 'comics' viewer that doesn't allow for pinch resizing or menu resizing of text (which is tiny!). It also does not allow the book to be rotated to landscape even though some of the art would be optimally presented that way. Paintings that are spread across two pages in the physical copy have a relatively thick black line down the center in the digital version--it's just bad presentation any way you look at it, and it mars what is otherwise a nice art book. I've requested a refund and will save my money for the hardcover version.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game for adults and children great app would recommend for the whole family my 3 year old lives this app
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book I feel was well written and I enjoyed the book, although I felt the ending was anti climatic and sort of leaves you hanging. the characters are great and that was what I enjoyed most. there were times when I did not want to put the book down. very intriquing plot and it doess keep you guessing for a good part of the book. Not one of my favorites but a good read.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie provide a great insight into the mind of someone with Autism. Claire Danes did an excellent job acting the role of Temple Grandin. I highly recommend this inspirational and motivational movie to everyone! It is also very clean and family friendly!
B000XKZQ74|5.0|\\"Movies\\" which generate out of actual events often possess an intensity which looms larger than the medium itself. I don't know if this story is true, the arc of the main character, an East German Stasi interrogator who is committed to his work rang so deeply it became something more than a movie. Not a common event. Shows how the great themes of life, sacrifice, nobility, gestures of friendship can be portrayed to deep effect in an artificial medium, such as a movie. Pretty good stuff, really.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Excellent movie, this movie shows the effects that long term health problems can have on people. The problems can be negative or positive. In this movie, fortunately, the effects were positive with a good ending.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Just like I remembered it from back in the daze, music to dream by! Took my oldest to see them about 10 years ago, brought back good memories of a father & son outing!

1451627297|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  I saw the ending coming though, almost from the beginning. Still, I recommend it.
B0060MYM3S|2.0|I asked alot of people before buying this, and they all LOVED it. So, I bought it, watched it, and was left wanting. Wanting better acting, better writing, better character development, better overall story line. VERY disappointed. Won't buy another season of this tripe.<br /><br />As for Amazon. 5 stars. Order went smooth, delivered on time and in good condition.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Gotta say, this is one of my favorite movies all time and I was absolutely excited to see it re-released in an amazing digipak casing that is identical to the cover of the Wall album. I love the bonus poster that comes with it as well! I highly reccomend this to any Pink Floyd fan worth his/her salt. Definitely a full 5 stars!<br /><br />Side note: This package was sent very promptly and arrived very quickly and there was no damage to the outside or the inside of the package. This is the very reason why I come to Amazon for all my online shopping needs.

B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Product was fine, movie story was not. The title should have reflected more what the movie was about. The passage of the 13th Amendment and politics. It was little about Lincoln himself. No real character study just about how he told stories. Mr. Jones was the best actor in it. Mr Lewis looked the part but was not the best in acting the part.  The plot was slow and contrived to create suspense but it failed to keep my attention. A better story line should have been chosen to explain more about the character rather then a political commentary on passage of bills through Congress.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Mile81 was pretty good but I feel I was charged too much for just a short story  typical Stephen King
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I always enjoy the opportunity to download classics to my kindle app on my iphone and iPad. I have read it before and enjoy reading it once more.

0547848412|5.0|Decided to read the novel instead of watching the film despite the best oscar for direction.  Interesting flow to novel and obviously great thought provoking ending.  Almost had me in the mindset of the Satanic Verses terms of religion fantasy and humour

B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This alarm clock is easy to use with many options to choose from. I look forward to any and all updates on this app.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|What a lovely title. And what a lovely book. John Green just has a way of creating a story and a world and sucking you along in his wake. His characters may be teenagers, but that doesn't mean the stories are less complex or deeply drawn. And this disparate group of misfits and popular kids who all come together because of the ephemeral Margo Roth Spiegelman are as real as my own memories of high school.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Really enjoy this every time I see it. My friends all come to watch it on my projector and it never disappoints.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was my first JoJo Moyes read and I enjoyed it very much though I made the mistake of reading it on an airplane and I'm sure the person sitting next to me was wondering why I was crying so hard. The characters are likeable and real, and even though there are parts of the story that are predictable, that's not a bad thing. She also tackles a tough subject - dying with dignity and on your own terms - with grace. Recommend.
030758836X|4.0|*note:inside the [] you will find spoilers<br /><br />\\"Love makes you want to be a better man. But maybe love, real love, also gives you permission to just be the man you are\\"<br /><br />I honestly don't know what to say about this book.12 hours later and I am still speechless and confused.Confused about the characters.Did I liked them?Have I any feelings for them?Did I saw what they realy are or I am blinded by them?<br /><br />I know one thing.They are good actors.They made you beleive that they are someone good,someone worth liking and pitying.But are they truly that?NO.Both trick you to think they are good,worth every good feeling you have for them.When you finish the book you might like Nick or Amy.You might think that what they did,their actions,were justified.I think everyone will have a different opinion and different feelings.<br /><br />Gone.Amy is gone there is a mess in the Dans living room showing that there was a fight and no sign of Amy near the horizon<br /><br />Girl.Even though Amy is almost forty author chose the world \\"girl\\" because Amy is still a girl.She acts like one sometimes.She will do everything in her power to get what she wants,like a little daddy's girl.<br /><br />The story is original(for me).It has mystery(who killed/kidnaped/whatever-you-want-to-say-it Amy?).It's a weird mix of revenge,love and regret.Nick regrets what he did[he cheated on Amy for more than a year. ]Amy wants revenge.[Nick didn't really love her(she says that herself)and is cheating on her.]Both fell out of love with eachother but somehow a little of that love survived.They still have feelings for eachother.It draws you to read it,to see why everyone did what they have done and how the story evolves.<br /><br />The story seemed simple in the beginnig someone kidnaped Amy(or something awful happened to her).Everyone thinks Nick did it.Especially after the police finds some suspicious signs at his laptop and a few other things.But is it everything as it seem?<br /><br/>The main characters are Amy and Nick.Neither of them is what she/he seems to be.Nick is a liar because it's easier for him[he has a mistress,a girl from the university he teaches]and doesn't love his wife anymore.Amy is sick,manipulative and better or almost better liar than her husband.She isn't afraid to do anything that will get her closer to her goals.She uses people and makes things seem like she wants to,for example that she is the victim.She wants to be perfect and everyone around her to treat her like a queen.Her parents by writing The amazing Amybooks created a monster.The Amy of the book was perfect and the real Amy was not.So tried very hard to be like her.<br /><br />When I first started reading the book I thought it would be nice to have theend the book has(or almost like that).But as I continued reading it I was so sure of what a good end will be.<br /><br />\\"My mother had always told her kids: if you're about to do something, and you want to know if it's a bad idea, imagine seeing it printed in the paper for all the world to see.<br /><br />I feel myself trying to be charming, and then I realize I'm obviously trying to be charming, and then I try to be even more charming to make up for the fake charm, and then I've basically turned into Liza Minnelli: I'm dancing in tights and sequins, begging you to love me. There's a bowler and jazz hands and lots of teeth.<br /><br />Like walking through a door. Our relationship immediately attained a sepia tone: the past<br /><br />I felt a queasy mixture of relief and horror: when you finally stop an itch and realize it's because you've ripped a hole in your skin.<br /><br />I'm in a foreign land, trying to explain myself, trying to make myself known. Because isn't that the point of every relationship: to be known by someone else, to be understood? He gets me. She gets me. Isn't that the simple magic phrase?<br /><br />My gosh, Nick, why are you so wonderful to me?'<br />He was supposed to say: You deserve it.I love you.<br />But he said,'Because I feel sorry for you.' 'Why?' 'Because every morning you have to wake up and be you.\\"

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You must read this! So well written. I think this author has a beautiful &#34;voice&#34; and a wonderful way of telling a story. These characters are compelling and so easy to get caught up in.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Yes, please, Amazon decides when I experience this work of cinematic art. Amazon a monopoly? Don't be such a party pooper. How else are you going to make all the people happy unless if you're a monopoly, silly.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really like this author! I read another book of hers first and had to try this one after reading the reviews. This book did not disappoint! Couldn't put it down and had to suffer the loss of sleep to finish it. Can't wait to read the companion book to this story.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places is not for the faint of heart -- be prepared for some heavy reading...however it's worth it to figure out the mystery. Another great read from Gillian Flynn!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a quick and sweet read. Nothing too unexpected, but sometimes that's nice too. The characters were actually nice to each other! Shocker!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|The sharks are very vivid. It would be much better that it can provide more space and more species fishes like sunfish for eating.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Didn't expect it to enthrall me so, but it has. The whole idea of story written from POV of the different family members of all the different houses, makes for a great story.<br /><br />You always feel like, there's something you're missing, and right when you're about to burst, GRRM gives you another little clue to the mystery :-)... Great job.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I like the game very much. It's a good game for me to kill time. It has funny music and animation.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|I'm not sure why Jackson has taken it upon himself to add in so many new elements to the original hobbit story when it has already stood the tests of time. The hobbit was not meant to be a dark epic quest like the LOTR trilogy, but instead a lighter main storyline with many side stories and characters. The whole time I was watching I felt like the story was being rushed from one scene to the next with no regard to the original chronological order laid out by Tolkien.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|One of the most beautiful movies every made. I just returned from Atlanta and a visit to the High Museum to see 140 original painting by Frida and Diego. Breathtaking! She was definitely the better artist, and Diego knew it. This is my second copy of this absolute work of art movie. I loaned the other and, well, it's gone. Salma Hayek should have won the Oscar for her portrayal of Frida. Those are Ms. Hayek's unplucked brows in the movie. If you haven't seen this, please do.
6305428387|5.0|I love this movie I grew up watching it and still as an adult love it. It brings a great message of anybody can achieve anything if they are determined want it. It reminds us to not judge others because they are different because they are people and gods children just like us and can achieve great things. Nobody should be left behind and this movie teaches that and it is also funny.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this moving.  Very slow moving the first half, but the second half was much better.  Hard to compete with the Lord of the Rings movies.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing book can't  wait to read the rest of the next two books. Very addicting can't put it down. :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was in no way expecting the twists and turns this story took. The way the back story came for the characters was excellent and the interplay between all the characters was great. Truly a must read!
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|The author has taken what could have been a great novella and expanded it to book-length.  I have enjoyed almost everything I have read by Ford, but this left me feeling like I had just completed a 50-mile forced march.  Other reviewers have gone into detail regarding the characters and the plot, so I won't waste your time with more of the same.  But, if you purchase this book, be prepared for a long slog.

1885167776|5.0|Ok. We all know that there is no get rich quick pill out there.  And many authors talk about all of the different disciplines required for success.  Finally, the authors have done the research that proves what it takes to have real success.  I felt a sigh of relief when I read about success being sequential and not simultaneous. I'm excited to share with my team the power of committing to just one thing and seeing the results.  This book will enhance not only your professional life but personal life as well.  It's a must read for everyone.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|The book was excellently researched and left me with a sense that I new the man, Steve Jobs , with a deeper insight than even several of his &#34;friends&#34;.  My only criticism is with the chronology of the events depicted in the book. It seemed to jump back and forth in time and at times was hard to follow.
1885167776|5.0|This week Gary and co-author Jay Papasan publishes their next book -- The ONE Thing. I had an opportunity to read an advance copy and there is no doubt that this book will surge to the top New York Times best seller list this month!<br /><br />In an information overload and multi-tasking world their message is clear and single-minded. You have to FOCUS on ONE thing.  Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus. Of course for most of us that is really hard to do. Distractions and popular philosophies are often the reasons why we think we can't or didn't succeed.<br /><br />Well, early in this book the authors challenge six widely popular beliefs and confront them as lies.<br /><br />1. Everything Matters Equally<br />2. Multitasking is Good<br />3. Success Requires a Disciplined Life<br />4. Willpower is Always on Will-Call<br />5. A Balanced Life is Required<br />6. Big is Bad<br /><br />They thoroughly discuss each point, although I am sure one could write a book about each of these topics. But that's not what this book is about. This is about ONE thing, and that's FOCUS. Being successful, according to the authors, requires less discipline than you think. It's about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right. So if you wish to thrive, prosper and flourish...decide what things you're not going to do!<br /><br />Bottom line... this is a self-help book and I have read hundreds of self-help books, even written some. I can vouch that it's always way harder to create, write and compile your many thoughts into a string of words that deliver a powerful message. Gary and Jay have done a great job! The book is an easy read with good structure, commonsense illustrations and a singularity of message. I would most certainly recommend reading the book. It will definitely challenge you to recalibrate some things in your life.<br /><br />In closing, and on a lighter side, here are three of my favorite sayings from the book:<br /><br />* \\"Multi-tasking is merely the opportunity to screw up more than one thing at a time.\\"<br />* \\"Life is too short to chase unicorns.\\"<br />* \\"Success is an inside job.\\"<br /><br />Stefan Swanepoel<br />New York Times Best Selling Author of over 20 books:<br />[[ASIN:0470947802 Surviving Your Serengeti: 7 Skills to Master Business and Life]]<br />Swanepoel TRENDS Report (2006, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12 and 13)<br />Swanepoel TECHNOLOGY Report (2013)><br />* \\"Multi-tasking is merely the opportunity to screw up more than one thing at a time.\\"<br />* \\"Life is too short to chase unicorns.\\"<br />* \\"Success is an inside job.\\"<br /><br />Stefan Swanepoel<br />New York Times Best Selling Author of over 20 books:<br />[[ASIN:0470947802 Surviving Your Serengeti: 7 Skills to Master Business and Life]]<br />Swanepoel TRENDS Report (2006, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12 and 13)<br />Swanepoel TECHNOLOGY Report (2013)

B00992CF6W|5.0|The stellar game minecraft has finally worked its way on to kindle fire and is amazing. This is the same game as minecraft Xbox and pc, but there are less features. Needless to say mojang is constantly coming out with new updates to support it. This is definitely worth a purchase even though it is rather pricey, but well worth every penny.<br /> Mojang has crafted a masterpiece that will define gaming for decades to come I give this game 10/10. This has been bossaru, giving you the scoop on the most popular apps. Ciao!

But unless you are an incredibly sophisticated cook - make that chef - I'm not sure that you'll use any of the recipes within.  Nevertheless, I'm very pleased to have received this book as a gift.  I think I will stick to reading the recipes and looking at the photos -- and letting the chefs at Eleven Madison Park prepare the dishes.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Ed Sheeran is terrific. This album is wonderful to listen to in the rain. Hopefully these small purchases will help bring more talented artists into the spotlight.
B008ODZEQ0|1.0|After reading some brief comments by Nate Silver, I was so looking forward to this movie.<br /><br />My excitement quickly turned to disappointment.  This movie could've been condensed into a 15 minute short.  I'm still not convinced that it wasn't 5 scenes that were on a continuous loop.<br /><br />I'm a sushi lover...and this movie didn't even stir my appetite.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great buy! 18 amazing tracks for only $6.<br />Totally worth the investment. Hopefully the investments will add up and encourage more talent to rise up to hit the charts.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|When I bought it a couple days after it was released, it was $30. which was an amazing deal for me. The package itself was great, and there is one main reason that makes the Blu Ray superior to all other editions (apart from quality): In-Episode Guide. Sometimes there is so much stuff happening and switching between locations, it can be hard to follow. But if you activate the in-episode guide, it can bring up the location, characters present with bios, and recent event history just by pressing the side arrow on a remote. Additionally, there is a lot of bonus content crammed on the fifth blu-ray disc, as well as all the episodes crammed onto two DVDs. Also, if you like that kind of stuff, there are commentaries on each episode. All in all, $30 is a no-brainer, and I would pay up to $50 if I had to.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This story is alright. It wasn't my favorite and it really wasn't all that exciting. But it did end better than ok expected.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I couldn't put this down once I started it which always indicates a great book! I loved the format of the story being told in letter writing form. I enjoyed it very much.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is challenging and fun. It has a lot of levels. I would say that it will definitely keep your interest.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watch Downton Abbey on iTunes on the Monday following its Sunday cable showing; don't have cable but haven't let that keep me from watching this awesome drama. Love it more each season!
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I have been listening to Josh Groban since he emerged onto the music scene. Josh Groban, Closer and Awake are my favorite CDs. Illuminations is also very good, but I was somewhat disappointed by All That Echoes. To his credit, I must say that he is demonstrating that he can break out of his usual classic pop format and mix R&B into his style. His voice is as rich and powerful as ever. Love ya,Josh!!
B001NA6096|3.0|Well done in many ways, just not my cup of tea. I would call it a, &#34;chick flick&#34;, and although I'm a&#34; chick&#34;, it just didn't suit despite excellent casting, acting and a sweet romantic theme;I'm not against romance, just  too much dialogue and not enough action for my taste. Maybe it will be your, &#34;cup of tea&#34;.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|While I understood this movie to be a musical, it seriously went overboard. A little dialogue would have been appreciated, and while I enjoy Anne Hathaway, I am having a hard time understanding how she won an Oscar for her performance, which lasted about 20 minutes of the 2 hour and 39 minute saga.
0061735817|5.0|I was not familiar with this book nor its authors when I ordered it. I was simply looking for an audio book to help keep me alert during a 12 hour drive and it caught my eye. What a wonderful surprise it turned out to be!  It is incredibly entertaining. Definitely one of the absolute best stories I've ever heard.  The narrator is brilliantly talented in bringing the different characters to life that  I felt the experience was more like watching a play than reading a book.  I enjoyed it so much that I bought a second copy to give as a gift before I finished my own and plan to buy a few more for other friends.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Just wanted to express my support by rating, not that I know all of this to be true, or what the solutions are, but I the main message is worthy.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I loved the first one. but after all of the updates to it. it became too complex for my kindle to handle and I had too stop playing. I was glad to see that this game is about half the size of it predecessor. I also love how the characters now look less like standard video game characters and more like Pixar characters
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I have to admit, when I first started this book, I was shocked at how terrible it was. It was only after reading a few chapters when I realized the whole thing had to be satire, intended to spoof bad writers and their tired cliches. I laughed out loud at the cook who was &#34;kneading flower&#34; -- and when the king literally adopted the hero, Thor, into the royal family despite having just met him ... Wow! Of course the best part comes at the end: Thor warns king of poison in drink; king ignores Thor and starts to drink; Thor slaps drink out of the king's hand; dog sips drink and dies, showing drink was indeed poisoned... and Thor is arrested for trying to poison the king! That one had me in stitches!<br /><br />The cookie-cutter characters are what really make the tale, though. It's as though Ms. Rice takes a grab-bag of stereotypes (e.g., the stepson with a mysterious past who develops magical powers, the bullying stepbrothers, the enigmatic mage offering cryptic advice, etc.) and boils away all shreds of originality. Then, when she mixes them into her incomprehensible plot, the result is the perfect embodiment of absurdist humor.<br /><br />Thanks, Ms. Rice, for a hysterically wretched novel! I'll be in touch soon to get my free book.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I think the movie did a fine job explaining how difficult it was passing the 13th Amendment, but I try not to read the synopsis when a title is as specific as this one was. So, I expected more of biography.

B00AU15HPC|5.0|This was purchased for my wife, a long-time, die-hard Moody Blues fan.  Here is her review:  I Love this CD! . I play Spirit of the Western Sky quite often and I must say that this is probably Hayward’s best solo album. Stand-out tracks are “One Day, Someday,” “On the Road to Love,” &#34;In Your Blue Eyes&#34; and “The Eastern Sun,” my favorite song on the album.  I also enjoy The Moody Bluegrass version of “It’s Cold Outside of Your Heart” and the dance remix of  “I Know You’re Out There Somewhere” titled, “Out There Somewhere.”  There really is no dud on this CD, you can listen to it from start to finish.  I am surprised to read complaints about the 25 second track “Rising” – you can’t just go straight into a dance track without some type of segue. If you are a Moody Blues or Justin Hayward fan, give this CD a few listens and it will quickly become one of your new favorites.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Beginning in Maine, a non-descript high school teacher, Jake Epping takes on the role of time traveler to try and prevent the JFK assassination. Through a worm-hole in a diner's pantry Jake enters the year 1958, not once, but a few times He does a \\"Test Run\\" first in Derry, Maine. There he tries to prevent the slaughter of a family and the paralysis of a young girl in a hunting accident. Convinced, he travels to Dallas and assumes the alias of George Amberson.<br />Mr. King has a fascinating way of not only adding distinct personalities to his characters, he somehow breathes life into them. They become real and a part of the reader's acquaintances for the duration of the book.<br />This novel has many facets to it, each has its own little story. The two large facets are, of course, the JFK assassination and a beautifully done love story with Sadie Dunhill, a Jodie TX. librarian.<br />Some of the characters are real, of course, all others are fictional. Whichever, they may be, Mr. King has done a tremendous amount of research into the 1950's & 1960's to produce this remarkable book. Originally set to be written in 1971, King held off feeling, 8 years was too soon for this book and history too fresh at the time. Now, travelling back in time from 2011 to 1958 he felt enough time had passed.<br />The book will leave you mesmerized. It will leave you happy. It will leave you sad. The original ending was altered at the suggestion of his son who came up with the idea for the ending which was used.<br />The ending is very bittersweet. You may feel awfully sad at the ending. You will also feel very sad this book has concluded and you must say good-bye to some very endearing people which have enveloped you. Jake Epping/George Amberson & Ms. Dunhill invite you fully into their lives.<br /><br />At just shy of 900 pages, there is no boredom, there are no parts one simply wants to skim through. Mr. King has created some very good work in the past. 11/22/63 is his masterpiece. I loved it.loved it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I read it all in one night and I cried and laughed the whole time.

B00BF123WG|5.0|I loved hurt locker and this movie was awesome too. Highly recommend to anyone who likes army movies  . .
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I would have given this app 5 stars (or more if able), if it weren't for the intrusive &quot;socialization&quot; so prevalent in other apps.  You can sign out or bypass creating an account during setup.  I believe that will &quot;disconnect&quot; from all tracking and Big Brother aspects of the app.  I kinda find it disheartening to find this crap built into even our bible study.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|Great to own the show but the round plastic part inside the case that holds the DVD in place was totally broken. I was lucky the discs were not scratched. Too much much money for a case that was obviously already opened! Ugh!
1416955070|1.0|My daughter was given this book by her unsuspecting grandmother to read. I noticed that it was in the young adult category, and I expected it to be more like a Twilight or Hunger Games knock-off. I was wrong! Thankfully, I trusted my instincts and read through the first chapter. This book has references to drug use, sex, rave-like scene, and demons all within the first few pages! Totally not appropriate or even understandable for anyone under high school age. Better suited for young women in their late teens-early 20s.<br /><br />I'm giving this book a 1-star rating because, in my opinion, it should be under the adult category, not for kids/teens at all!
B008CRC506|5.0|How could this not be good. Love the show and characters.<br />Show has everything in it.  Loved finding out the inner workings of Broadway.<br />Sorry to see the program cancelled

B000002LEE|5.0|When ever you read the Editorial Reviews they come from some kid or someone that was not into the seen when the album came out. This album is what Jane's addiction is all about. It shows the rough life they were leading at the time they wrote the songs. Just a bunch of poor musicians from the streets living a rough life and writing about there experience through it. From Mountain song to Jane Says, This is by far the best album Jane's Addiction has ever made. Don't get me wrong, the other albums were good But Nothing Shocking is a classic that can never be duplicated.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Popped up a messag that they could not play my movie right  now and had a 1800 number to call.  Hoping to get my money back after all the hassle.

B009NQKXYK|2.0|Supposed to be a prequel spinn off story arc blah blah blah of Aliens, but then its not supposed to be, but just about everything is the same... cept the dumb aliens... Yea, not a good movie.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|This movie drags on and on for 2 1/2 hours.  The ending climax, the raid on the compound, was filmed mainly in the dark with flashes of night vision scenes.  If we didn't already know what happened, the audience would have been lost.  The character development was weak and unexciting.  What was a good story, was ruined by dark film making.  I hope some day, someone will make a really good film about this story and the heroes involved.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Best movie ever, i don't care what you say, this movie was fantastic. i recommend anyone that likes movies, and the president that made men free watch this.
0307887448|3.0|I've read plenty of virtual-reality books, so what really shot out to me about this one was the hilarious originality of the 80's coming back into fashion a good 60 or so years after the decade ended. Cline does a great job of working the 80's culture and some pretty believable technological advances into one intensely entertaining plot. (I've often seen technology treated as a sort of magic wand, so it was nice to have him describe in detail all the parts of what made the OASIS work.) I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />That said, this is not the best I've ever read, not by a long shot. Cline's prose leaves something to be desired - I constantly found myself correcting sentences in my head, especially when I first started reading and hadn't quite got into the swing of things. He's also apparently a believer in \\"telling, not showing\\", which takes away from the thriller aspect of this book a lot. I found myself skipping over long swathes of Wade action scenes, just because I knew what was going to happen (there was going to be an action scene, Wade will win if it's a critical fight, blah blah blah), and it didn't really engage me. However, this seems to be Cline's debut novel, so I'm willing to cut him a fair amount of slack in this division.<br /><br />The second major flaw in this book is Wade Watts. Wade is a most excellent character; I like him a lot. He's almost unbelievably realistic, and it makes me awfully happy to see a shut-in, overweight, otaku protagonist. I haven't seen a well-written one in quite a while.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, Wade embodies every bad trait a realistic, shut-in otaku protagonist could possibly have. He obviously has good points, or you wouldn't care about him, but in the first six chapters, his bad points overwhelm you. He's immature. He's a know-it-all. He's arrogant and foolhardy, militantly atheistic, and preachier than a bishop on Easter Sunday (the last time I met a bishop, who was actually the nicest old man). To top it all off, he's a teenager. Wade is an utter snob in the way that only the really smart and very young can be, and he makes sure you know it with a heavy-handedness that made me almost put this book down in disgust.<br /><br />This all makes him a great character. I've met plenty of people who behaved and believed just as Wade does. I just haven't really liked talking to most of them, and I guess I wouldn't like reading them either. While Ready Player One is beautifully subtle about it's messages on things like Internet privacy and open-source policies. It's about as subtle with it's social views as Godzilla in Tokyo.<br /><br />The final flaw (which isn't really a flaw, but more of an lack) was the absence of villain characterization. IOI is a straightforward villain company. Everyone looks the same, everyone's cheating (well, not really, but we all know they are), the head honcho is a jerk. They're very good to hate and unabashedly cruel. There is really nothing else to say about them, and that there is nothing else to say is in itself the problem.<br /><br />It's hard to see real people in IOI. I don't feel anything when Sixers die... because I never cared in the first place. In a way, they are much like the faceless villains of a real-life video game: there only to provide the challenge of beating.<br /><br />Which is why I sort of regard Ready Player One as adolescent fiction. In many ways, this is a very idealistic book. It tries hard to portray a sort of dirty grungy cold reality, but it's views, villains, and heroes are very black and white and often shallow. Neither views nor villains grow (the heroes mature a little). I feel that a grown-up Harry Potter book (as it's been billed) should teach me something, change my outlook on life a little, let me see a bit deeper into the motives, hopes and dreams of others. Ready Player One was entertaining, intensely geeky, and very fun to read once I got into the meat of it. That was it. I remember nothing more.<br /><br />Perhaps I've been rather harshly critical in this review, but there are a lot of high praise-type reviews already on Amazon, so I sort of felt obliged to make up for the lack. :) So I'd like to end by saying that all this aside, I did enjoy this book. I would read it again. And hopefully, so will you.<br /><br />Perhaps I've been rather harshly critical in this review, but there are a lot of high praise-type reviews already on Amazon, so I sort of felt obliged to make up for the lack. :) So I'd like to end by saying that all this aside, I did enjoy this book.

B008M34CSI|5.0|Awesome, fun, and entertaining movie. Really kept you involved and excited. Something about a badass with a severe sarcasm problem makes a movie fantastic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love being able to brush and pet the horses. It's a relaxing and fun game to pass the time without rushing.
B004PYWRQC|3.0|....I got this movie because my ol lady and i are obsessed with demon horror and religious spooky things. This movie was a bit over the top, but was cool in the thought concepts it brought to your imagination.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Re-read this on a whim, forgot how thought provoking it is. Whatever your beliefs, this story may cause you to pause and consider how much more we can achieve together.
B005PK56TA|3.0|...buuuut the sexual influences are a bit too weird for me, theres a lot of strange sex things going on in this show that i can't keep up to.
0425264351|5.0|I started backwards having read a current Reacher novel.  I was so enthralled by the mode of writing and the character that I decided to start with the first book.  I intend to work my way through all of them.  I especially appreciated and enjoyed the author's personal story at the beginning and how he came to develop the character and name of Jack Reacher!  Give me more and more!<br /><br />The novels are also tutorials in a sense as you learn much about problem solving, analyzing in detail every situation, and trusting yourself.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|...Good movie, really enjoyed watching it. Saw it on dvd and theater and would watch it again. Probably because i'm a nerd.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book so much!!!!!!!<br />This is the best book I history of books!!!<br />Make more diary of a wimpy kid
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game  has a few glitches but you don't even notice because its so additive awesome time killer for me
B002VHI8J0|4.0|Having seen the movie and considered it interesting but probably not able to deliver the detail the book would I bought the story.<br /><br />The writing is brilliant, the story better told than the movie and the characters are detailed and real.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book about a true American Hero. Mixture of professional life stories as well as personal life was extremely well done.
B00BI4M0A0|4.0|There were many changes made from the book to the screen but it was very good. The box set for this season is a must for any fan. The changes that were made I can understand and add a different element to the story.
B00742GBDM|2.0|MUSIC IS GREAT.  JOHNNY LEE MILLER IS FAB.  BUT THE REST AND THE PLOT LIBERTIES REALLY TURNED ME OFF.  FIND A DIFFERENT VERSION.  ANY OTHER VERSION.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|An awesome product and well worth the wait. If it weren't for the need to sleep I wouldn't have stopped construction.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have read some poorly written, poorly edited books, but this is undoubtedly the bottom of the barrel , in my opinion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I . Love this app if you like temple run or temple run 2 this is the app for u
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Love these actors - great movie.  Denzel is always great, and Ryan plays his best role in this.<br />Wish it had not been R rated, but don't recall a lot of bad language - mainly the violence, which we<br />expected for this type of movie.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|So this game is great. It has very nice controls. I love the way you get to choose the way you control the car this game is a great game totally for everyone
B003TQKVGU|1.0|was not looking for religion<br />some good ideas<br />too many references to god<br />the title is misleading<br />enough, enough, enough

076421120X|5.0|Have you been blessed by the music of Darlene Zschech - the dynamic worship leader whose song, Shout To The Lord, has been sung by over 30 million churchgoers?<br /><br />Are you looking for a fresh devotional to help bring you daily into the presence of the Lord?<br /><br />If so, you'll be excited to learn that Darlene has just released Revealing Jesus - A 365 Day Devotional!<br /><br />I have greatly anticipated the release of this book because Darlene's worship music touches my soul, and I expect her daily vignettes to do no less.<br /><br />The book does not disappoint.<br /><br />The devotions in this book stem from Darlene's personal time with God, and speak of how Scripture progressively reveals Jesus and His finished work in our lives. Every devotional that I read addresses an ever-present need in our hearts.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />The January 16th devotional, Vulnerable, reminds us to be aware of our vulnerabilities and to do whatever is needed to care for our souls.<br /><br />The March 27th devotional, Clean House, challenges us to rid ourselves of attitudes and actions that prevent us from pursuing holiness.<br /><br />The July 6th devotional - He Meets Our Need - reminds us that no matter what our struggles are - Jesus is the only one who can truly meet our deepest needs.<br /><br />Revealing Jesus - A 365 Day Devotional is part of a larger project - the #RevealingJesus project - which involved the simultaneous creation and release of a companion worship CD and CD-DVD.<br /><br />Darlene says:<br /><br />This whole concept has come out of a simple longing for more of Jesus to be revealed in my life. More of Him in every area of my life, starting with my heart...<br /><br />Darlene believes that spending time with God through devotional meditation is an act or worship.<br /><br />You don't have to be the greatest singer or musician to be a great worshiper. Whether you are in the body or as an individual, open your heart and adore the Lord from the very core of your being. That's all that He's asking.<br /><br />Revealing Jesus - A 365-Day Devotional provides a perfect pathway for deepening your relationship with the Lord - and makes a beautiful gift for a friend!<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from the publisher for review purposes.

B004SD5GZ4|1.0|It does nothing for me, I need another Adobe software and I can't seem to get it to download<br />Word
0451197968|5.0|I've read about 6 Stephen King books and this was easily the best so far. I wouldn't argue with people who consider it a masterpiece.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Generally, it reads at a very fast pace.<br />-Even today, - the whole premise, setting, and so on still feel very original and inventive which is a big benefit to the book given the formulaic nature of many bestsellers.<br />-The lead has an awesome attitude where he is constantly acting like an a-hole; sort of like Bruce Willis in \\"The Last Boyscout\\". Provides for a lot of hilariously-dark dialogue, etc.<br />-Some passages are so well-written and skillfully put together that it is fair to say the writing blows away the work of many other authors. You can just tell that there is real inspiration and talent on display here.<br />-Is effective on many levels, meaning fans of various genres will find a lot to like throughout.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-The true greatness/significance of all the characters and circumstances aren't really fully felt until you've finished the last page. This is not really a \\"con\\" - just an observation that you should stick with it if you feel it lacks something in certain sections.<br />-This has nothing to due with the text of the novel itself, but DO NOT read the introduction \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" before you finish the rest - that intro contains one of the absolute WORST SPOILERS that might exist for the actual story itself.<br /><br />The Schwarzenegger film, on a side-note, ends up having almost nothing to do with this book...however, I think fans of that film will like this. If you like action, suspense, thrillers, or sci-fi - the chances are that you won't want to miss it.
B008MM9630|5.0|Very fun good graphics I like the music relaxing and the cool trees those are the best seeing what they grow to mature into to.
0805047905|5.0|All of our grandchildren love this book.  It's a must for children.  Great pictures, of course easy read, and a great additionto the library.
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|4 good flicks, but the presentation of dual-sided discs, is not good...the director's cut of the first 3 LW series of 4 are all director's cut.  the 4th is just fluff.  Certain lines still make me laugh.
0060775858|5.0|A classic and one our daughter and son-in-law read to our granddaughter every night!  Our oldest daughter, age 36!, had this book when she was little (and still has it).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of those fabulous British series that keeps you engrossed from beginning to end each season.  I'm looking forward to the next season.
0811879542|4.0|Gets little ones fingers and hands involved when reading this adorable book.  How important it is to involve even the youngest listener to point at things when you're reading to them.  They'll get better as they get older!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I should've rated this game one star, because that is usually what I score on this game.  But it is a time waster and that is why I play it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I cant wait until I get the Uncles Foal!!! I have played this game on my Ipod too.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is awesome but a few times the first day I got it there was an unknown error and I had to reinstall it. Other than that I love the game.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Excellent film, great cast of characters.  Thought everyone in it was good.  Jaimie Foxx surprised because I'm not a huge fan of his films, just because of Stealth.  But as Quentin did in the past he can make anyone shine in his films.  I had no problem with the length.  No boring scenes to me.  Dialogue was nicely contained and well placed.  As always I don't get bothered by language in most movies, and Quentin always uses it correctly and meaningfully.  Violence was a bit over the top on some scenes, but in Italian Western they were.  And in some scenes he violence was down right scary and nasty, as he's pulled off before.  Nonetheless, the movie was fun and exciting.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was tough getting started. I skimmed several pages/chapters before I could really get into the book. But once the first twist was read I really liked it......until the end. Didn't like the ending!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Itslove the game  fun and madning at the same time.I love the different levels and how it gets harder with each level
B0012GMYTG|4.0|Just like Alice Cooper's album \\"Trash\\", I also bought \\"Hey Stoopid\\" in April 2011.  I would like to offer my ratings of all of these songs:<br /><br />1.  \\"Hey Stoopid\\"...This song has a GREAT meaning for the youngsters who are alcoholics, druggies, or even for those who feel suicidal. I esp. love that ONE line of this song, that says \\"SOMETIMES YOUR ANSWERS are HEAVEN SENT\\".  Nice INSPIRATIONAL words, which was the SELLING POINT for me. I really LOVE this song.  Ozzy is a featured background vocalist & Slash is one of the featured guitarists.<br /><br />2.  \\"Love's A Loaded Gun\\"...I love this song very much & I remember when this was a hit single.  It is my 2nd Top favorite.<br /><br />3.  \\"Snakebite\\"...I like this song.<br /><br />4.  \\"Burning Our Bed\\"...This song is okay, but it's not my favorite!<br /><br />5.  \\"Dangerous Tonight\\"...I like this song.<br /><br />6.  \\"Might As Well Be On Mars\\"...Just like \\"Love's A Loaded Gun\\", this song is definitely the best, actually it's one of my TOP favorites.  This is an excellent ballad.  This song was also very familiar to me, when I first bought this CD.<br /><br />7.  \\"Feed My Frankenstein\\"...This song is not my favorite, but it is comical @ times.<br /><br />8.  \\"Hurricane Years\\"...I like this song.<br /><br />9.  \\"Little By Little\\"...I like this song.<br /><br />10. \\"Die For You\\"...I like this song.<br /><br />11. \\"Dirty Dreams\\"...This song is ANOTHER one of my TOP favorites, that TIES w/ \\"Might As Well Be On Mars\\", even if these 2 songs are ENTIRELY DIFFERENT from each other. \\"Dirty Dreams\\" is a  song, that's NOT easily forgotten.<br /><br />12. \\"Wind Up Toy\\"...A typical Alice Cooper song that's quite WEIRD & not too easily forgotten, either.  It's about a mental institution, which puts me in mind of \\"The Ballad of Dwight Fry\\", from the \\"Love It To Death\\" album.  Also \\"Steven\\" from \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\", comes to mind.  It's a pretty good & STRANGE song!<br /><br />This song is definitely recommended & you nevercan really go wrong w/ music from Alice Cooper.
B009ME47H2|2.0|Recorder not loud enough, maybe i need to sit closer to the speaker, i will try it again, then hopefully it will work better
B00973902K|1.0|i picked a different song with my mp3 credits and this one downloaded instead, very displeased. fix your s*** amazon.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this app so much I recommend it to everyone from 4 to 60 years old boy or girl this app is fun and creative. There are tons of colors, and accessorys, the possibbilitys are endless!!!!! Worth eve  penny:)
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|This is Hitchcock's best film, I believe. The making of the film is a story in itself. The new film, &#34;Hitchcock,&#34; focuses on the trials Hitchcock faced getting the picture made. The book, &#34;Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho,&#34; is excellent and is what the &#34;Hitchcock&#34; movie was based on.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Excellent scifi show. I love the picture and show details. Great quality graphics. Thanks for providing my favorite episodes and scenes on a great network.
B00BF11STU|1.0|Watching Grass Grow is More Entertaining.  Very slow, lots of exposition; not at all compeling; little if any character development in the first 30 minutes, which was all I could stand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game it is so much fun you have to jump over a lot of obstacles.and it is very cool all of my friends have that game and its mobile not like other games that you need internet.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I thought that it was good. It would have better if it was longer and a bit more challenging. I look forward to more games.
B009XWD02G|1.0|This was the worst scam you guys could put on us. I hated this app. I just wanted a app that would get music on my Kindle Fire and my Android Phone. It doesn't even download any songs. It also has a ridiculous count of ads popping up on it.
B000I5SY5U|5.0|I have lost count of how many times I've seen this movie. It is one of my all time favorites. For me musical movies and clowns merit the same dislike. I just plain don't like them. This movie is different from other musicals in that 99% of the time the songs are performed on a stage in a German night club. This makes a big difference because one doesn't see the silly scenarios of people expressing their love for each other in song. Joel Gray is phenomenal and absolutely makes the movie. Liza Minelli is her usual go for broke self trying to prove she has more singing talent than her mother Judy Garland. But when not singing, her perky acting style somehow works very well in this role . The Kurt Weill themed music is both nostalgic and seductive. Bob Fosse does his usual magic with the dance numbers. All these elements combine to make an excellent movie yet for me the movie has a certain inexpicable something that makes it very, very special.
B005F9TPZ2|5.0|simply beautiful!!!!!  i'm a fan for life. was just introduced to her music recently and cannot get enough! so sorry i just missed her tour.
B004HD61KE|5.0|James Rollins weaves a fascinating thriller within the scope of modern science and facts that emerge from US history. You'll meet characters who make the story easy to believe in searching for the plot's resolution: fiction at its best!
B0000DIXLM|4.0|I bought the complete eagles. I am an eagles fanatic so it was  missing some. If ur an averge fan u may not notice.  As far as greatest hits sets this is the complete , not including the entire collection box set out now.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game. Good colors & decent graphics. Good in-game daily rewards & realistic difficulty of missions to level up. A lot of fun
B00BF123WG|2.0|The movie was mildly entertaining with subpar acting. After it was over I didn't feel like I wasted 2hrs of my life, but I wasn't wowed either.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It is a Google Product, I expect excellence and I receive it every time.  Google is the only Search Engine I use.
B007P06DJK|5.0|An absolute &#34;must have&#34; for Paul Simon fans.  The documentary chronicles the making of the album and putting together the African concert.  It even covers the appearance on SNL.  Historical, political, and essential.
B0041D843M|5.0|A must read for anyone interested in diet, health and how to live better and longer. If you are looking for research to back up diets the RDA don't cover, this it it. Read it with an open mind and then check out more info from many doctors that agree.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Thought it would be kind of fun to mess with but it didn't do much for me. hard to make the game work and instructions were lacking.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Fascinating descriptions from a non-religious person's experience of another dimension. The brain is yet not fully understood as this neuro surgeon came to discover and share through his book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app because it's like you have your own horse and it's so much fun to take care of and I love this app
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Streamed instantly, quality was average... great movie!<br />Able to skip to certain parts or go back if you miss anything.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another great game from G5! I enjoy most of their games. This is an interactive game with puzzles and hidden objects.  This type of game is challenging and fun.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is so cool it is like mine craft<br />and I can make my own world and I can make a world for my dad
B007ZXK08C|4.0|It was not the best book of the year but it was a good reflection of American life.  I guess you could  call it a light read.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Although ARGO is an entertaining film and I like Ben Affleck, he is miscast in the role of Tony Mendez. I think Alan Arkin would have been better in the part, but he's getting too old to be running around airports in his shorts and flip flops, if you get my drift. Everyone knows Iran is a lovely place to visit and the people are still warm and friendly towards Americans, especially in the summer. The transfer is crisp and clear like a piece of celery in a petri dish and the aspect ratio is comfortable.  I think this movie is somewhat overrated and the best part was when all those papers were shredded in the embassy.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book is filled with love, war, and disease; and a girl trying to survive it all. It is a new twist on the original fairy tale everyone loves. Bottom line, Cinder was a wonderful read.
0345536886|3.0|I am a huge Grisham fan, but this was just not my favorite story. In the beginning I loved this tale about a small law firm that goes up against a giant firm in order to get a dangerous drug (the jury is still out on Krayoxx as far as I'm concerned) off the market. Yet, the ending was a huge disappointment. The characters were interesting and the lawyers were all unique in their own way, but not in the way I'd hoped. Grisham's magnificent storytelling ability is in evidence as usual. He takes us up and down and eventually----just down. I was expecting a different sort of story, and I didn't like the ending. I was rooting for the underdog. Except in A TIME TO KILL, it seems like he never lets them win. He is still one of my favorite authors though, and I will continue to read his books. By the way, when is the next film coming out? I'm tired of waiting!
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Brandon Sanderson's conceptual themes are wondorously intriguing.  I look forward to a sequel which hopefully will give more insight into the heroine.
B008XCM18Q|3.0|I could not find anything in this book to recommend anyone buying it.  There are so many authors that have written far better books.  Perhaps this one was not up to his capabilities.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I enjoy his writing style and level of detail. Good stuff. Even better than Salvatore, of whom I am very fond of reading forgotten realms books.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It takes a little amount of time to get into the book, as does many of his books, but it is worth all of the time.  Well written, good details that make for a very good read.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|First it must be said that although this book is a fun read, it does not live up to the previous work of this talented author. I had the continual feeling that the author was in a hurry to finish and publish this book.<br />  &#34;The Shadow of the Wind&#34; still remains his finest writing and I hope that Mr Zafon regains the magic of that previous release.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've never read ANYTHING like it. Incredibly written and very addicting. The moment I picked it up I fell in love. Even more in love than the first book. This one was just, amazing. It introduced more, new, facinating characters which changed my life. I fell in love with Finnick Odair and getting a bit stalkery with Sam Claflin, who is playing Finnick. But anyways, Suzanne Collins is amazing. I have been finished with the Hunger Games trilogy and now I'm working on Gregor the Overlander. Collins is wonderful and has tons of creativity. Its just great to read a good book like this. The end is what grabbed my attention. I was stupid. Very stupid. And I decided to read the end of the book FIRST. And that gave it ALL away that somehow something happened, somehow they had done something extreme.... So I had to read it. BEST. BOOK. EVER. Read it. Get your mind BLOWN. You wont ever regret it.
B007TK77QE|3.0|This book is a great read, story plot is intriguing and interesting the characters are very true to rural life, I can see another sequel could yet be made from this first book, well done.
B001D09OAI|5.0|This is a very fun, and entertaining movie, especially if you are a baseball fan. Several in the cast were unknowns at the time (1989) like Wesley Snipes, Rene Russo, and Dennis Haysbert. They used real ex-MLB players for members of opposing teams, and Charlie Sheen actually pitched in high school, so he looks natural on the mound, no body double needed.<br /><br />The new owner wants the team to lose so she hires players no one wants due to age, can't hit, or can't throw, and a manager from the minors. There are crazy fans and an announcer (Bob Uecker) who spikes his own drink through the entire game. Somehow they make it work. It's a movie I watch about once a year.
B00AV68GOA|5.0|It was very intriguing as I had never before read anything written in the Script Book style.  I really enjoyed it and wish they had this for Seasons 2 and 3 also.  I would recommend this for all fans of Downton Abbey.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like my horse because it is fun and entertaining!  It is my favorite app on my mom's kindle.  Love it!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I love the music of Paul Simon and this collaborative effort is one of my all time favorites. I wore out my original cassette copy! The South African legends and groups on this CD meld into a wonderful ethnic dish for the ears. Buy it and rock on down the road.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Mr Wilson met and exceeded my expectations as he further developed his signature style by fusing it with early folk rock harmonies, gutsy heavy rock, and fusion jazz.  A whiff of CSNY, a trill of Jethro Tull, a breeze of Kenny G are spattered across the album and skillfully woven into the progression of the classical chording and supporting the lyrical values.  None of the boring or annoying repetitious phrasing of today's top 20.  As a matter of fact, the first track, &#34;Luminol&#34;, is very much like reading a novel as it opens with heavy drums and a beautifully throaty bass then transitions into intricate melodies, almost without notice, swelling to classical heights and fabulous chord progressions, before closing out with a jazzy guitar.  At one point I had to check the track to assure that it hadn't moved on to the second.  In &#34;The Watchmaker&#34;, a  gently phrased story of aging, dispassionate love, the delicate opening instrumentation swirled into a channel of energetic depth that rotated back to the tender touch of keys and lyrics then pronounced the end with vibrating drums and a blanket of vocals.
B009CNGCYE|1.0|Follet's books are almost always a good read. The first of the trilogy left me wanting to read this one.<br />How disappointing. So amateurishly written, that I suspect that Follet didn't really write it.<br />He took highlights of  WW2 and had his shallow characters present at each highlight.<br />The love interests sound as if they took place among 14 year old kids, and the plot is virtually non existent.<br />You just flop from one incident in the war to another not really caring what happens to his wooden characters.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Entertaining, enjoyable puzzles, and a good length for a game. I will be interested in trying other games by G5.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe is the best science fiction tv show ever. If you haven't seen this series, you are missing out. All of the characters fit their parts perfectly and each season just gets better. My wife and were hooked on it from the pilot and we have seen all five seasons twice and we are going through each season for the third time. The way the writers incorporate fringe events with some real science and terminology is what makes fringe so good. We wish fringe could have been continued and last as long as General Hospital.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Visually this movie was captivating. It really looked like the 1960s, had all of the best props. The movie itself however seems to move very slowly, especially the first half hour. The deadpan acting, while interesting at first, got old after awhile.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Co I o o o o I l<br /> D d d Dr e d e d d d d xxx s
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|First had this on a Bootleg album when it came out way back then. I loved it then and still do now. To hear it mastered onto cd was<br />a godsend as my vinyl got played to death. For any Bowie fan this is a must have, exellent playing and great acoustic versions of<br />Space Oddity, Andy Warhol, My Death. Mick Ronsons backing vocals are an exellent backup for David. This did come out as a<br />special Box set, which had a Book+T-Shirt before for this version when the late Mick Ronson passed away. It is a great Live album to have with Ziggy Stardust Motion Picture cd.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this app so much ... only thing is when it says pay 500$ to continue what does that mean is it what it says or game related?
B0018AK9RK|3.0|Being a Priest fan for many a year this album didn't quite hit the mark for me. Why didn't this get produced by say the likes of Roy Z but with the sound he gave to Rob's solo albums. Some of it just sounded well average. The highlight is the title track. Each to their<br />own on how you like this. The packaging of this is wonderful though.
B000089RV6|5.0|This was the very first CD I bought years and years ago. Just recently lost it and had to replace it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a very good game to play i  my free time. i would tell all my friends to use it.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|very happy with all my purchases  three were presents and the recipients were were delighted am looking forward to ordering more from you  Cheers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A wonderful read! This is an intriguing story from parts 1-5.  I can't wait to read along the twists and turns undoubtedly awaiting me in the \\"Shift Omnibus\\" that created the outcome of human existence living in a large underground canister.  I trust that Hugh has this figured out for me!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its addictingly fun and amazing! If you have doubts about getting it and choose not to get it well your missing out on a whole lot of fun!!!
B000AM6OQ2|3.0|hate widescreen probably wont  order anymore movies if they are on the widescreen format customers should have the option to choose
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great strategy board game.  A bit overwhelming at first.  BUT the instructions are very clear and concise with cross references, index style, for all the cards and possible plays.  They even give you a website that walks you through setting up the game and getting started.  After the first time playing we got the hang of it, and now are able to set up the game and choose the best sites for our cities.  The game can be time consuming, so you should set aside a sufficient amount of time.  I'd say a two hour time frame.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys board games.  You need at least three people to play which can be difficult in my house since my daughter and I are the only ones who love board games.<br /><br />What a great way to spend an evening with the family! No TV, no video games, just good old fashioned board game fun!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This is a really compelling book. Most of the book is an account of DEVGRU training and some really good accounts of some of the author's earlier missions prior to the Bin Laden raid. This part of the book is almost as interesting as the account of the Bin Laden raid itself.<br />One thing to keep in mind is this is NOT an account of how the US Intelligence Community tracked down Bin Laden. That story gets very little attention. This is really only about the raid itself. It's the last 300ft of a marathon to find the world's most wanted man.It's a very critical piece of the story, but not the whole story.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Girls night together?  This is a great &#34;go-to&#34; movie if your snowed in, bad weather, don't want to spend time at a club.  Fun!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Simple ! It has always been one of my favorite movies of all time, ever sense I was a kid ! I would impatiently wait for it to come on TCM, and I would watch it ! I've on idea how many times I've seen it, but I just needed to have my own copy, so I can watch it as many times as I want !
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Wonderful love story with several dark twists , and an ending I could never have predicted.  I would say a good, quick read.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|He thinks this is a classic movie and watches regularly. For him it is pure entertainment and the actors are great.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great twist a little too easily seen. Starts strong then gets unnecessarily brutal. Lots of characters, but not too confusing.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I did not know what to expect when I purchased this book. But I became engaged right away; character development was crucial considering the environment took time to grasp. An easy read with great creativity.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Read this in a day. If you liked shelter island, memento, you will like this book. Interesting and novel plot. Surprisingly good read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Greatest book I've ever read. I love the story behind it and absolutely great examples of perseverance. The way that they stand up for each other is extraordinary. It, to me, is like a basketball team to me. August is the post. Summer is the point guard that tries to help August get the ball to him. Jack helps summer and August so that would make him a wing or shooting guard. Julian and life are the defence. But as in every good book, it ends, 100-99, August on top.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I am just now beginning to read the classics that I have never had the time to read and found &#34;The Call of the Wild &#34; an excellent book and I plan  to read all of Jack London's books. I am now reading White Fang
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great book. What's great is not all the drama (pregnancy , suicide , molestation, physical abuse) , I was almost expecting - on a very special Blossom .... but all the little things. The kiss, the way gifts are carefully picked out, the importance of books/music and wanting to share it with friends. The incredibly interesting way Charley thinks and interacts with people and how he changes them and they change him.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Makes me want to get up and dance every time I play the CD.  And I love to play my music loud and El Camino can handle volume, and my singing!
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|this is an easy entertaining and often ribald series of victorian england where werewolves, vampires and souless people all live together - it is silly but yet hilarious and great fun. the author is most eccentric and i applaud her creativity to say the least.  I have read other steampunk books and never bothered with the whole series after reading the first. I hope that Ms. Carriger will continue on this path as for me, I do enjoy her stories.<br />Enjoy this great summer reading!
B001PB3RU8|4.0|Definitely a preface for the selections she produces now.  Florence's voice reminds of Annie Lennox in the way she uses her voice lika a musical instrument!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|They had me at the stars in this movie but the story line is lovely. WOmen and men in England deciding to live in a hotel in India.  They all have problems and the hotel, they find upon arrival, is not finished and needs much help.  The characters unfold in unexpected ways for some and thier reasons for coming to india also revealed.  The scenery provided me with a new perspective of india not the exotic (excuse the pun) one we often see.  The movie shows that retired and geratrics in various stages of thier lives are most useful and offer much to the world, despite our youth hungry media here in the US.<br />This movie also appeals to men and women i have found and rarely do movies of this kind appeal to both! ENJOY!!
B004ZNB12O|5.0|Brings back happy memories and produces a contact high or comfortably numb! Should have bought 2 because I'll wear this one out
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Some people forget that they signed a disclosure statement.<br /><br />Could Owen have had the book submitted and reviewed for classification issues - Yes.<br />Did he do it for profit - Yes.<br />Does it provide depth and bring out tactics,techniques and procedures that are utilized - Yes.<br /><br />Ok, so its a point of view about a point in history. The reader needs to take it with a grain of salt and recognize that it is just one perspective.When you start looking at the whole team and see that this isnt the only other story coming out; that several of the team received UCMJ actions for illegally consulting with a video game maker (that's real smart) and being removed from the team - then you have to wonder if there are more issues behind the curtain.<br /><br />I bought the book used so I didn't put money in the pocket of someone that was supposed to honor the faith and not disclose information. Following the standard and submitting the book isn't that hard to do. My choice.<br /><br />Like the old NFL commercial - You make the call.<br /><br />If you want to be entertained - read the book. But take it all with a grain of salt.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|great music, great vocals, invigorating, I can't believe I've just appreciated them. More please! Hope to catch them in consert!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Cant beat the series - made for a great gift!<br /><br />Couldnt beat the price or the access<br /><br />Would I buy it again - most definitely.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I can't say enough about my first impressions of the BK2 and will add to this when I actually put it to use....BUT, the sheath is horrible!!!  If I could have seen the entire package I would not have bought this item.....I thought,we'll, I can just get another sheath but all options I have seen cost more than the knife. For myself,I will have this knife with me when I need such a brute but not on my hip.....probably in a pack or lashed to my gear bag. I give it 4 stars,even though I would not buy again,due to the knife only and it's reputation. OH for a reasonable priced sheath!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I liked how the CD wasnt scratched and it was super clean. Very light and durable and packaging was recycled:)
B0028R3NCU|3.0|I wish these would be more derable.  I have had 4 others that just stopped working.  I will by more when this one stops working.  I like the size and how easey it is to use.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|Birthday present for my daughter arrived very timely and it was exactly what she was looking for.  No issues at all@
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|Beautifully written, with skill and sensitivity.<br />Characters are alive and vibrant throughout.<br />The letter format is unique and adds depth to the storyline.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Play a few minutes. Then wait several hours for energy to replenish. Crystals are rare so you get many offers to buy them. I hold my privacy dear so I'm not on Facebook. Wants to be a social game while I want a personal game.<br />5/30 update:<br />I keep running into problems with trying to load the game to play. It doesn't matter where I am in the house even if I'm next to my wifi. Frustrating.<br />The game is interesting way to pass time.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I finished in less than 48 hrs bc I couldn't put it down! I was told this would be gruesomely dark but it really wasn't for anyone with even a slight interest in crime novels
B00785P2QC|4.0|This app is great need to earn money a little quicker but overall a very good app everyone should try
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was just words with definitions blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah boring
B007YA5NRO|5.0|This guide is a helpful addition to the sometimes sketchy information found in the original instruction manual that comes with the Fujifilm X10.  It contains good information and hints to make the use of this fine camera even more enjoyable.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I was pulled into the first book within the first few pages. This book was no different! Full of suspense and action. I couldn't put it down!
B002A9VJ40|4.0|This movie is right at the top of the charts for pure entertainment value.  The aerial photography is incredible, and the action sequences are a real adrenaline rush.  The only reason that this movie doesn't earn five stars is because there are spots that require too much suspension of disbelief (why would the Navy spend all tha money to fly recent TOPGUN graduates to the Indian Ocean, when the carrier already has two Tomcat squadrons full of pilots just aching to mix it up with a couple of MIGs, and how could they possibly get therein 24 hours in any condition to fly?); and much of the dialog is just plain dumb (&#34;So he did do it right?&#34;  &#34;Yeah, he did it right.&#34;).  A little more effort on the screenplay and this would have been one of the greatest movies ever made.  As it is, it's still a great romp and a great evening's entertainment.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|A nice read, goes by fast and for me, a new fan brought in by the tv show its entertaining
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This sucks do not get it it really sucks I hate it. BOO. REALLY<br />DO NOT GET THIS IT REALLY SUCKS.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a great app, it's not to much and for owning a kindle it makes using it so simple to use and I like the background noise option!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|IT SUCKS VERY BORING DO NOT GET IT I HATED IT SUCKS DO NOT A BIG BIG VERY BIG BOO
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Love this app. The video is wonderful and with a two year old its fun to have these memories. The only problem I have is I can't figure out how to delete videos and photos. If anyone can help with that it would be wonderful.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|I got this game when it was the free app of the day. It is a fun and challenging game with a lot of levels.
B004J4WL50|5.0|Enjoyed this book from the perspective that it gives a good inside look as well as sound, high-level advice backed up by examples of how to get a startup that matters rolling. I'd recommend it to entrepreneurs thinking of starting something new, or feeling that their current path is missing the piece that makes it a fulfilling endeavor. It's a quick, entertaining, enlightening read that will stick with you long after you finish.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|The last time I saw this version was on the old sci-fi channel.  I was happy to know it was on DVD.  Great version of the movie that clarifies a lot from the first film. The shipper of the DVD was great as well.
B00B10DZQE|5.0|Ever since seeing Jay's &#34;Iron Cross&#34; photo years ago, I'd always been intrigued by his story. While this movie has its fair share hollywood sugar coating, the overall inspiring message still comes through in a big way. Also have to give Kudos for including real Mavericks surfers in the film. There is some great footage that emphasizes just how huge and brutal Mavericks is, but I'd say this movie is all about the positive message of living in the now, going after your dreams, and enjoying the journey. I personally came away inspired and more dedicated to reach life-long goals I've not achieved. I'd add this is also a good &#34;family movie&#34; too.
0739366408|5.0|What I liked about this book:<br />The idea to put together the voice of many people to tell one story was brilliant! I totally enjoyed hearing the story from many different angles, genders, walks of life and ethnicity.<br />The stories give different sides of the event political, social, the military, and economically. Unlike some of the other stories in the genre it doesn't just tell the stories of survivors.<br />It's the most realistic version of what a zombie apocalypse is like. It didn't feel silly or campy just straight forward and often scary!!<br />What I didn't like about this:<br />Some of the stories ended just as soon as I was getting into them and the characters. There were one or two stories that could have been cut out to make other stories longer. All in all the stories were satisfying, so much so, they could have had their own book.<br />Overall:<br />This is the best zombie book I've ever read! It is so realistic it is scary. There is not a whole lot I can say about this book other than  every zombie fan should read this!
B00BF11STU|5.0|One of the best films I've seen in a long time. The re-enactment of the raid is outstanding, edge of the seat action.  I highly recommend this film.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I choose this rating bc I am very satisfied with shipping speed and cost. I love Maroon 5.Adam Levine is a great singer.
B00B935SUY|5.0|You will enjoy this interesting behind the scenes peak at music production at this iconic studio!  Well worth seeing.  Well done!!
B003PIUBZS|3.0|Didn't know that this was the first season. Watched the second season first so there was some confusion. It sould have a<br />pv 18 ratng on it because of blood and guts.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Recommended by a friend. I will now read anything she recommends. This was a true treasure in a book. Bravo!
B0060MYM3S|3.0|OK, this is like the first season but elaborated. If you have the first season you don't need to get this move for only the<br />death of Stark is where it starts.
B00004TJTS|5.0|Dogs and cats will see us as our best, even when we don't see ourselves that way. This movie is a great example of that. True story that is very entertaining.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|It was the typical blood and guts movie like Gladiator. A LOT more blood. There so much acton you need to sit down and<br />watch it from the first to the last. It was the type of movie you wouldn't want a teenager or young adult to watch.
0345803485|5.0|I liked this book.  Of course I had to read the complete series after reading the first one.  I liked it well enough to send it to a friend as a gift.
1449410243|5.0|This is a book I believe most will appreciate.<br /><br />Is it just for cat lovers? No. I'm less than fond of cats, and actually own two dogs, but I found this to be amusing. If you've read the Oatmeal's website, you'll have an idea of what to expect.<br /><br />Great book, better website.
0345803493|4.0|I liked the Book One of the Trilogy the best, but of course I had to read the complete series.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I liked the movie a lot and found it to be very entertaining. Actors did a great job of portraying their sensitive profession while spraying pullets and other projectiles in just about every direction. 4/5 for sure
0345803507|3.0|Not as good as the first two books in the series, I liked the humor that was in the first book the best.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The characters were compelling and realistic. The plot was gripping and haunting. Not a read for the faint of heart though.
B00821OX98|3.0|It surely isn’t great, and not even that good. It’s even predicable. Yet there is something about it that keeps me and my wife returning for another viewing, which we think will be our last. We are about to eat and which another episode, so wish us luck.
B004WMKXWM|5.0|This is a very good movie.  We bought all the Harry Potter shows and loved watching them.  Great story and great movie
B00BRR66SA|4.0|Some of the songs drag on a bit too long for me but the album is pretty solid.is A different sound and style at times for JT, but in a mostly good way.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Well what can you say its Zombies against humans and then humans against humans.  Hate the governor...LOL we love the show.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Gave three 3 stars for just downloaded this. Looks okay at the moment. Will see how it works after trying out.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a good movie.  Lots of action, never got bored and was worth the money. I would recommend to anyone who thinks they might like it to try it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Watch this wonderful, period version of the Odyssey.  A great way to get your fill of the ancient author, Homer, if you can't bring yourself to read it.
B002RRWWQ4|5.0|This is a very good movie.  We bought all the Harry Potter shows and loved watching them.  Great story and great movie.
B00005JLIU|5.0|This is my favorite &#34;Feel Good&#34; movie of all time.  I do wish it was available in streaming video (hint).
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This movie was better than expected.  Loved the beautiful colors and the story was very sweet.  I highly recommend this movie but not for little ones as they may get bored and there is one scene where the momma gorilla is killed and I dont think that would be good for little ones.  Other than that I love this film.
B001BANK32|4.0|For a book that has three main characters stuck in a hotel for most of the story, I thought this was very well done. Saw the movie before I read the book so I was never really interested in this story. I am very glad that I went for it. Loved the idea of the shining and the context that this added to some of his later works, but I don't know that I enjoyed this as much as The Dark Tower series, Hearts in Atlantis, Salem's Lot, or 11/26/63 (the JFK book because I know I got that date wrong). Those are my personal favorite King stories, but this novel definitely is able to stand up on its own merits.
B0075MFS9Y|1.0|Who has the patience to listen to this insincere crap? Obviously, this album is concocted rubbish and the product of a Focus Group with a \\"You WILL Like Us\\" approach. The album is Pure Poop. Heard that phony lead singer's voice/affectations on the first track and I knew they were a fraud, immediately. Try writing and performing a MELODY. Another Fake, Concocted, Blue Grass/Phony Country Music product of a Public Relations Consultant, styled for today's young, duped hipsters.
B0022WCZRK|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever made. Original, complex, and achingly beautiful. If you don't like this album you just haven't listened to it long enough.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|One of the best in the Jack Reacher series!  If you liked other Reacher novels you will love this one.
B005GSY23M|5.0|YEAHHHHH DRIVE!!!!!! I like to listen to this album when I'm driving late at night pretending I'm about to have a dangerous, sleek and very Euro-hip adventure. Then I go to Wendy's.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love this program for the ease of use and I can sync across all of my devices which is wonderful.  I have read the other reviews about permissions which sound bad but since I have not looked into this myself I can not comment on it.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Good movie, It depicts what Jesus Christ went through in his last 12 hours. Then he rose 3 days later. Love God!
080701429X|5.0|A wonderful read if you are the kind of person that always wonders about your purpose and the meaning of life. I highly recommend it to everyone, especially the psychology majors because Frankl takes a psychological view of his experience. This book is not just another Holocaust story, it is more than that and you need to read it because it will change your life in subtle ways.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Yes it's different from the Lord of the Rings (not a serious) but it's still good in it's own right. Can't wait for the second
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Try it. You lose nothing &amp; will find out why I rated it 4 stars. I don't think you want to remove this game from your device after playing it.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|The movie is exiting and brings out the best in Robert Pattinson. It was a difficult read as a book but the scene with Paul was like a well thought over, chess game . You can feel the emptiness in Pattinsons character , the desperate search of why he can't find excitement other than in destroying everything he build. Just like Paul he tries of find a meaning. To be honest , I never imagined this book being a Movie but I give it to Cronenberg, its very compelling. Do not buy if you are interested in some action fast paced movie because this film plays out more as a performance on stage with dialog after dialog. You really need to pay attention
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|awesome game! you can buy jetpacks and gadgets in the game. mange mostly the game is fun.<br /><br />I do not know??? or mabye
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|This connector works exactly as intended.  I only gave it four stars, though, because if there is no sound playing from the connected device (like my phone), my dock speakers make a horrible buzzing noise.  I'm not sure if this is the cable's fault, but definitely a downgrade from using the dock properly, which did not make that noise.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I've been waiting since Nov to get this on my kindle hd fire !!!...almost panic when I couldn't link to my FB friends for the tournament..but after the two day glitch..I WAS BACK IN THE GAME !
B003TSEEDY|4.0|So many surprises! A tear jerker. Couldn't stop crying through most of the book, but definitely had some laughs too! Very touching story.
B0035XQW74|5.0|Gerad Butler at his finest!<br />One of the best thrillers to come out of Hollywood in a long time.<br />Jamie Foxx was actually decent in this one but Gerad Butler carries this one all the way
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Was intrigued by this historic event and the movie kept giving. Only 4 stars since it was somewhat drawn out but not a deal breaker.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'm a hard-core Alien(s) fan and it just doesn't get any better than watching these classics in Blu-ray Hi-Def.<br />Break out your M41-A Pulse Rifle and Stay Frosty!
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|Not so good. Cant recommend even though I normally dig these dark hitman kinda flicks it was just soooo drawn out and weird.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE this show... I am angry at the writers for killing off some of my favorites characters.  Would definitely tell others to watch this series.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|It was an ok movie, typical organized Mexican cartel drugs and more drugs, guns tough guys hot chick etc etc..
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Claire Danes is awesome.  I'm still in the 1st season; the POW actor is sooo creepy; anxious to see how he changes; it he does
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Its nice to enjoy a movie that's wholesome for a change and PI delivers. Its a rare gem, have some tissues handy.
1439107955|5.0|I am currently battling cancer and I am enjoying this book; although I must say, I have to re-read some pages; very technical
B00AFEXRME|5.0|There aren't enough words to describe. Denzel is the man! What an incredible performance. If you do anything you need to watch this movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I usually don't have a problem putting a book down when I need to. With this series I consistently had trouble putting it down. Throughout the omnibus I never got bored, never felt a lull in the story. The world is richly described and you can't help but care about the characters. I would recommend this series to anyone who riveting loves a post apocalyptic mystery thriller.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Was a great entertaining movie, all 007 movies deliver just wasn't getting it for me as the hype about best Bond ever was being pumped into the media I guess I kinda expected more. But hey.. they always say that, right?
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Ok so at first I thought this was the best game ever but then I noticed sometimes it froze for a second mid jump, which was really annoying  because it made me LOSE the game. Also, it sometimes goes REALLY slow and is annoying. On the bright side, it is so much fun, addicting, and almost as awesome as super Mario bros. I would give it two and a half stars if I could.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Was ok, just more of the same but the old guys are some bad mo fo's, so there you go!
B0006J28KU|5.0|This movie is a classic and I will no doubt watch it repeatedly, as all the key characters have acted superbly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My son loves this app!! He had been playing it non stop since the day it was downloaded!<br />No problems with the app so far
B007N8RULO|4.0|Shortly after I got my Samsung Galaxy SII, I received an email offering this particular version of Spider Solitiare for free, so I downloaded it, installed it, and it works wonderfully.
0307352145|4.0|As someone who has always been \\"slow to warm up\\" and struggled with Guilt that I'm not more outgoing and talkative, and that I usually start thinking about the sanctuary of home about 25 minutes into the party, I drank this book like a long-dreamed-of elixir. The idea of the introvert as somehow unfortunate and needing help/advice/urging to just Jump Right In, is something we have all bought into, even we introverts. I bought 2 copies and I'm sharing:)
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I think I should of bought the free one not in HD instead of this version but now that I bought this I can't return!:(
014241493X|5.0|This is not a book that I would normally pick to read. It's just not my genre. But being a huge fan of John Green, I decided to take a leap and buy all of his books. This is the first book I read from him. I must say that I am very impressed. As I said, this is not a book I would normally read, and yet I am blown away. John Green fully captured the ways teenagers speak and act. The book is beautifully written and the story is captivating.
0061537969|3.0|I read this in one day because I skipped over all the pages and pages about car racing which was meaningless to me.  I had no idea when I bought it that this is  a story told by a dog as a vehicle for talking about NASCAR etc.  Since I am not interested in that, I skipped over all the parts which had almost nothing to do with the plot, and that was probably 30% of the book.  The plot was pretty good, sad, done many times before but interesting coming from a dog's point of view.  Guy is a car racer, marries, has a child.  Man is away a lot trying get his big chance as a race driver, but not quite making it, and holding a menial job.  Man's wife loves him, they are happy, wife's parents don't think he's good enough.  Wife gets terminal disease, parents take her and child in because she needs full time nursing care and he has to work.  Wife dies, parents surprise him and sue for custody of child, set him up with a bogus statutory rape charge, etc.  Dog is the loyal, understanding and philosophical one witnessing his master's life as only a dog can do.  It was sentimental and sweet, and since I have a dog, I can identify and enjoy a lot of it.  To be fair, if I was a race fan, I probably would have loved the book.  So the three stars is just because there was too much racing detail when I wanted plot.............sort of like when an author puts in long sex scenes or descriptions of food, or clothing that have little to do with the plot of a murder mystery.
0312944098|5.0|Outstanding story by one of the best authors I have read.  Spent several \\"all-nighters\\" getting through this gem.<br />Highest recommendation for a top read.
B004EPZ08E|4.0|This was so much funnier than I anticipated....I was pleasantly surprised.  Jason Sudakis and Jason Bateman were my favs....although MF Jones was pretty entertaining too.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I have purchased all of his albums and this one is by far his best work. He continues to reinvent himself which shows his creativity and artistry.
B00ATPVA78|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Big Fish Hidden Object games and often play the slightly more difficult ones. This one is an easy breezy, not a whole lot of thinking through it game, which is so cool. I'm able to play it when I'm not suffering one of my traumatizing migraines  and that is very rare.<br /><br />Only problem, not known to those familiar to this type of game from G5, will stop play about a quarter of the way through & then spring the news that if you wish to play more or complete game, must purchase full version of said game, which put me off of the whole G5 system of games!<br /><br />I would recommend this game for anyone looking for a calm, easy, quick game, but would warn them they are only getting part of the game & must buy whole game to complete it!!<br /><br />Very disappointed in that aspect! Other than that, easy, calming & simple...
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|In the beginning of this book, all katniss did was be depressed about her district because it was destroyed. Once she moves to district 13, peeta comes back because coin HIJACKED him, which would have been interesting but seemed to bore me. Katniss didn't even seem to care. The book did get better at the end. But I was really sad when finnick died because he eventually became a great character and right when I realized this he died in one sentence without meaning.The epilogue made no sense and katniss never really loved Peeta again<br />The book does turn out fine so I suggest reading it. Don't get me wrong, I am completely in LOVE with the first two books, but not as much this one. If you have read the first two, read this one. And don't give up on it.<br /><br />-laurenh reveiws<br />..
B00BEWCKFG|5.0|Ryan Tedder has really outdone himself this time.  This album has been completely worth the wait... it's the lighter side of OneRepublic.  They need to hustle back to the states and tour here, already!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love all the angry birds' games. They are infectious.......  I highly recommend it. Will look for more Angry Bird games to download.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I got this app out of simple curiosity. I kept because of its usefulness and  variety. It's very entertaining as well. I don't always use it for meditation. I use it also as background noise to block other noises. I like how I can create and save my own sounds or I can create new ones as the mood hits. I have dyslexia and being able to distract my ears while doing other things helps me keep my mind on task. It's very helpful with things like reading and sewing. I really love this app. Thanks for creating it!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It has its moments.  Sometimes it is a real challenge and other times it's okay!<br />Will look for another one like this and hopefully more challenging.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|my kids loved this games I would recommend it highly it keeps you busy and entertained for hours I would it again
B009AMANH4|5.0|An excellent movie !! Not just another movie about the blood and gore and injustice of the south,(which still exists), but the politics that went into the whole nation.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Best game I've played in a long time.  The puzzles start out simple but then start to become much more complex.  It really gives my brain a workout.  And at the same time the music is wonderfully soothing.  Love it and can't wait to try the others.  Oh! and it plays great on my Kindle.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I loved the entire series. Very sad about Andy Whitfield's passing. He was the best actor to play Spartacus.But we do get used to the new actors.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It makes it so easy for me to work on documents on my Kindle that I can later check on my computer. Brilliant product.
0061992860|4.0|Most of the stuff is &#34;duh&#34; (IMO), and a lot not relevant to terrain I haunt. But it's small, and easy to toss in a pack or keep in a car. Illustrations are decent.<br /><br />It offers some alternative methods for things that I hadn't thought of before. Nuggets of info if you will.<br /><br />I'd recommend it as part of an overall learning package. IE- rather than rely on a single source, get several that offer different methods to accomplish he same tasks.
125000568X|5.0|I bought this book as a birthday present for an obsessed teenager....she absolutely loved it!  This book came w/ so much more than I thought it would...throughout the book on different pages there are copies of old promo posters, old ticket stubs, all kinds of neat stuff.  I was really jealous of this book.  lol  But yes, get one of these for your Queen fan ASAP...too good of an offer to pass up.  :)
1400052181|5.0|This was one of my favorite books of the year. I read it for discussion in 4 different book clubs and they all felt it was an excellent book. Many important issues lead to very good discussions in all groups. I would highly recommend it for book clubs.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love, love, loved this App.  So much FUN!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! GREAT for any age!! It was also a free app which I absolutely adore. Thanks for creating such a wonderful app and making it available to all with the FREE option.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The combination of intrigue, fantasy, medieval weaponry and wolves make this show a keeper. The story lines are a little much. Insestuous twins and their oh so wise dwarf brother. Tame wolves.  Almost too far fetched to be beleiveable. HBO hit the jackpot!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have read several books about near death experiences and each have been different, but this was really out there. I'm not questioning Dr. Alexander's experience, just how he describes it. I wish he would have spent more time explaining the three different realms he encountered and a little less on his family dynamics.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|very well done you should try to be more competitive on pricing, I'm sure you realize that Red Box will only charge $1.25 for 24 Hours
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Based on what might have occurred in World War II, this is an exciting, suspenseful novel.  One of Follett's best.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I had difficultly getting through this movie.  I attempted to watch it again and again.  It wasn't until the introduced the rainmaker that the movie caught my attention.  Form that point on I was in.  Glad I watched the entire movie.  Like some reviews the director took the journey and it is well worth it.  Bruce and Joseph in one movie-  : ).  I've been a fan of Joseph since Mysterious Skin...and will be a fan for life based on that one movie.
0143118757|4.0|Based on a portion of the body of work undertaken through the Harvard Negotiation Project, the authors create a solid framework that can be used for any situation during personal, business, government, and institutional negotiations.  Through a well-written and easy to follow narrative that includes multiple case analyses, they illustrate a people-focused methodology based on principled negotiation that seeks to transcend the positional and power dynamics of a negotiation.  While the book is no-technical enough for the novice, even a seasoned negotiator will find that the book serves as a handy reference.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|It's been an interesting ride for this English group. They captured our hearts and won instant acclaim with their 2004 debut Hopes and Fears, introducing a poppy piano-driven sound that managed to win over both mainstream and indie listeners alike. The follow-up Under the Iron Sea was moodier and darker, a twisted ride through the troubles the band was going through and it's definitely my favorite album of theirs. It expanded upon their sound and added new atmospheric touches that elevated them to exciting new heights. I know I'm in the minority but I really enjoyed Perfect Symmetry, the band's previous full-length album. It was certainly different but it was nice to see them keep pushing themselves and taking chances. However, their Night Train EP from 2010 was pretty bad and featured only a couple of really great songs. After all these twists and turns I was curious to see where they would go. As it turns out, they went back to square one. Kind of.<br /><br />Strangeland isn't a major leap forward but it isn't exactly a return to their roots either. Instead it feels like the band took the best elements of their previous records and combined them into one definitive album. The piano is heavily featured here from their debut, while the atmospheric sprinkles and diversity are here from Under the Iron Sea and the experimental synthesizers from their last album are still here, just in much smaller doses. There's nothing here that will upset diehard fans and nothing really different that will lure naysayers in either. It's a typical Keane record and that isn't a bad thing at all. In fact, I think it's a solid contender for their best work to date.<br /><br />\\"You Are Young\\" is a strong start, setting a positive tone that the other 11 songs on this album will tow in form. The lyrics focus on pushing through difficulties and arriving on new shores that you didn't expect, only to find out that it's better than you imagined. The darker and more personal songs are still here but they're outweighed by a positivity and reflectiveness that continues to demonstrate the band's growth. The album's first single, \\"Silenced by the Night\\", is a chiming and catchy tune that encompasses Keane's trademark sound to great effect. \\"Disconnected\\" is classic Keane, a pure slice of pop that features Tom Chaplin's soaring vocals and plenty of stellar keyboard and piano work. This is also the first album to feature bassist Jesse Quin as an official member, though his presence isn't all that noticeable. Piano and drums have always been at the heart of the band's sound and that remains the focal point here.<br /><br />That doesn't mean there isn't some diversity here. \\"Sovereign Light Cafe\\", \\"Day Will Come\\" and \\"Black Rain\\" are wonderful pieces that find the band stretching their musical muscles. \\"On the Road\\", a bouncy number that reminds me of a-Ha's \\"Take on Me\\". It's new territory for them and it definitely caught my attention the first time I heard it. The closer \\"Sea Fog\\" is notable for it's gentle sound and brooding soundscape. Special mention goes to \\"Neon River\\", the album's best track and an absolute epic that I have yet to tire of hearing.<br /><br />One thing I really want to compliment the group on is the production and mastering of this record. It has a lot of dynamic range and isn't over-compressed like so many albums today. This was the biggest complaint that I had with Perfect Symmetry; it had so many layers to it and yet it was ruined by horrid production and ear-piercing levels that should have been mastered much better. That's not a problem here and the warm sound makes it instantly inviting and engaging.<br /><br />Strangeland is neither a major step forward nor a leap backward. It finds the band in a comfortable spot where the focus is simply great songs and memorable melodies. They're focused and having fun, making a great record for fans old and new alike. No filler, nothing surprising---just pure melody. The shores of Strangeland arewarm indeed.warm indeed.
1433210428|5.0|I first read this book in college and it was one of the better recommended readings at that time. Now, I counsel war Veterans suffering from symptoms of PTSD and I refer to it frequently. I have also recommended the book to clients. While I don't often follow the existential model, this is an extremely important book, particularly when used to help victims of PTSD attempt to find meaning in their experiences.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very useful app. I do use it quite often. Very simple, but suits my needs just fine.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Good movie, it kept my attention. I wish the main character would have been more developed, and I would have liked it more if the torturing scenes were not there. They were hard to watch. That being said, it was an exciting movie, and I would recommend it.
B004NTDEXY|4.0|This is just a personal opinion, but I don't like the multiple feature discs.  However these are two great films and you can't beat them together, especially for the price.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy was the best I have ever read. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and I couldn't stop reading. BEST BOOK EVER(: <3
B001AR4K8K|5.0|This is a classic that any horror fan must have.  One of the better vampire movies in my opinion.  It'll almost make you forget it was directed by the same guy that did Batman & Robin.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|TOP NOTCH ACTING FROM THE UK.  A GREAT SERIES FROM OUR BRITISH FRIENDS--WE ARE SEPARATED BY A COMMON LANGUAGE BUT THE PERFORMANCES MAKE UP FOR IT.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv.  The blu ray's look great and this show will never disappoint.
B003U9TDII|5.0|Quickly becoming the greatest movie soundtrack composer of this generation, if not ever? I'm a fan of John Williams and his influence will never be forgotten, but Hans Zimmer makes you feel like you are part of the film. It is impossible to imagine the movie without his soundtrack, the audio cues are nothing short of amazing. The sounds from Inception will live on in people's mind for the rest of their life. \\"Dream Is Collapsing\\" with it's large horns and clashes, and the rapid fire strings is one of my all-time favorites.
0345529057|4.0|I love this series.  One of the best sci fi or fantasy series ever written.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is I had to return this particular set because of its size.  I can't stand small books, and these were printed as such.
B0023S50DO|5.0|A good, clean, well-acted movie that showed humanity and depth of compassion in an action movie that is so far one of the most disaster movies I think I have ever seen.
0545265355|4.0|As an adult male I was skeptical if I'd like this series.  I enjoyed it.  The books are well written, easy to read and follow, and are printed in the perfect size.  No squinting due to the books being tiny.  I always appreciate this!
B002QNTNL6|5.0|I have always liked this movie!! I like Colin Firth. Amanda Bynes is good in this movie - Topic is great
B000NQRE0K|4.0|I normally don't do Mel Gibson movies, but this movie is a must for any movie fan.  While it is long, it is a great film all the way through.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|its a super fun game I love the challenge of it but it can get a little frustrating when u r about 2 get 2 a checkpoint and the timer runs out DONT listen 2 any reviews that say it sucks
B0015GDVTU|2.0|Despite not being a fan of &#34;chick flicks&#34; I tried to keep an open mind.  This movie was just flat boring and dull.  Gerard Butler should be slapped.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|It's a nice story. An easy quick but entertaining read. I liked the main characters right away. Definitely want to know how the story ends.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|This is a great film.  I am from the town where the beginning was filmed so there was a little more incentive for me to purchase.  However this is a great Harrison Ford flick and is easy to watch over and over.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really Loved the book! It was a great and easy read. I Cannot wait for movie to come out to see on the big screen how I imagined.
B004BLTNL6|4.0|If you are a horror genre fan you need this movie.  Avoid the remake and stick to the original.  Great movie, a classic.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|When ever I start playing, this freaking app doesn't open!! I am deleting this app . don't get this app. It is a waste of your time
B0002KQNL8|5.0|I LOVED this movie growing up and love it even more as an adult.  If you like zombie films you need this.  Hilarity shall ensue!
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I have read this book 3 times; it is the best SF I have ever read. It has stood the the test of time.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|This is a great comic movie.  If you are a fan of Michael Keaton, or just want a good comedy this is for you.  Keaton brings a great performance and is a definite must see.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Very addictive and fun.  It Starts out easy and gets frustratingly hard.  But persistence will get you through every level.
0307595579|4.0|This is a great series. If you enjoy thrillers you need this series.  The books are good size, good sized print, and a great read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good piece of fiction includes lot of legal concerns. The  author  pointed out some deficiencies in governmental . The novel is little bit depressive. It shows the sufferings of prisoners. The plot is not bad. Actually, the author is a talented storyteller
B005ER6STG|5.0|I'd heard a lot about this movie and bought it site unseen.  WOW.  If you like a good psychological thriller with a twist this is the movie for you.  It is in subtitles but is easy to follow and has a very original story.  Not for the weak-stomached or someone that is easily shocked/offended.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is an easy game that you can enjoy on its own or by challenging yourself for speed and dexterity. Enjoyable for a few minutes spare moments and also habit forming.  Ages 6+ to adult.  I'm retired and using it as one tool to keep sharp .
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|The service was great, the price was right, and it is one of my all time top 10 favorite movies.
B000024C7W|4.0|I'm one of the kids on Track 6, &#34;Ai no Sono&#34;. It's my little claim to fame. ;-) I even met him once and got to sing the song with him, many years afterward. Amazing!
B009KEN87O|5.0|What more can I say, this is a great &quot;old school&quot;-style arcade shooter!  A blend of Space Invaders and Galaga.
1451695195|4.0|For anyone who thinks that a person with bacterial meningitis isn't really that sick and thus couldn't have a NDE, let me vouch for the fact that this illness is just as devastating as Dr Alexander says.  I am not a doctor.  But in October 1990, my mother was rushed to the hospital, unconscious, with a temperature of 107 degrees (yes, you read that correctly) and was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis.  She was in a coma, unresponsive, had no brainwave activity, and was kept alive on a ventilator for one week.  Her final scans verified she was gone, and her team of physicians advised me to remove her from the ventilator.  I requested a two-day delay so that my brother could return from being out-of-town. . .and the very next morning, my mother woke up.  From that day forward, she was known as &#34;the miracle lady&#34; because she really was gone -- we had the scans to prove it -- and miraculously came back.  She reported no NDE experience for what it is worth.  In fact, she had trouble verbalizing anything that made sense during the year it took her to recover (and though disabled, with assistance she then went on to live a good quality life for another 16 years.)  I just want to vouch for the fact that Dr Alexander is NOT exaggerating in the least about his meningitis: this is one illness you NEVER want to have, because it will either kill you, or bring you literally to the point of death.  Just knowing that meningitis was the cause of his NDE makes his experience more believable in my view.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The first section of the book, I loved!! The Hunger Games section, um, was kind of confusing for me. I mean, it was in present tense, but it didn't make sender in present tense. Other than that, it new me away!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My husband and I are addicts and spend many mindless hours playing this game when we dont feel like thinking to hard
B0039NK0LE|1.0|terrible, crass movie.  i'll not watch anymore on Amazon if this is there normal fare.  It was a COMPLETE waste of money and time.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I have read many of the new writers on Amazon, many of the free and inexpensive books. Most of them were okay, some were awful, but you couldn't beat the price, so I would never dream of complaining. But this book was a different category altogether. It was awesome! I could not put it down, and, after writing this review, I am going right back to Amazon to purchase all of the other books written by this author.
B001HMSFFC|1.0|the character are shallow.  i could haven't written the dialogue.  My god, Amazon, why would you put this movie on your menu.  You are hurting your brand!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|The Bourne Legacy gets better with each viewing!  Good story and great action scenes.  Jeremy Renner was perfect for this role. Rachel Weiss's strong character and performance added depth to the movie.  Edward Norton's character was fantastic--some great lines.  I look forward to the sequel--with the same cast!
B009AMANBA|2.0|Boring TV movie, with thick, stilted dialog--did they really \\"talk\\" that way then-- that would make even poor old wordly Shakespeare balk. As a PBS enactment of a certain period in Lincoln's life, with commensurate expectations, it would be watchable, and maybe, if not enjoyable, amusing. But as an overwhelming Oscar winner, as a proclaimed \\"masterpiece\\",  it's absurd, a joke. Lewis is very good, but not great. He's got the posture nailed, and the accent nailed--whether or not they're like Lincoln's is almost irrelevant--with, for better or worse, plenty of croaky hoaky artifacts from Gabby Hayes. But when you compare Lewis in Lincoln to Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, you have to conclude the Oscar, that bulsh exercise, was literally stolen from Phoenix, who is in my book the best actor going these days.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|A highly addictive game!! The only negative is the amount of &quot;lives&quot;. Only five at a time then must wait 8 minutes for one additional life. You get in the flow then no lives left!
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I love the music so much that I have heard it over 100 times. My husband is getting tired of hearing it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A real page turner, from start to finish.<br /><br />The language was rich and expressive without being stilted in any way.<br /><br />Ms. Collins can write.
0756404738|1.0|NOTW was an excellent read. It was a new and unique spin on a common plot (my parents are dead and I have to go to magic school to learn how the stop to people who killed them). Kvothe was mysterious and clever, and I craved every moment of his progression. I loved Kvothe then.<br /><br />WMF made me sick. Kvothe's \\"cleverness\\" was excessive and annoying. As another reviewer stated, Kvothe's progression felt more like the author's own personal fantasies. By the time he started having sex with everything, I couldn't stand it anymore. I hate Kvothe now and, as a result, have no desire to continue with the Kingkiller Chronicles.<br /><br />In the book's defense, I did not read the last 20 pages, but assuming they are anything like the rest of the book, I'm glad I didn't bother.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I love this book because it keeps you interested and intrigued by keeping you guessing. Agatha Christie is an extremely talented author and writes fantastic books.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book and couldnt wait to get home from work and read. It is thought provoking and written well. I felt I knew these people and could see the story from all points of view (except Jacob).
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is great I love the look and feel of the game and the big world they gibe you to explore. you can even upgrade your shark or buy new ones so it doesn't feel repetative. but just recently ive noticed that for some reason the game wont save my game so I always start off with the first shark on level one. plz fix or let me know if I need to do something to fix this
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|A friend told me about this series, after downloading the first episode, I was hooked! I decided to buy it and am so glad that I did!  I can't wait for Season Four! The acting, costumes and scenery are top notch!
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Just love this movie. Patrick Swayze....that's really all that needs to be said.  Like Jennifer Grey, too & of course the late,  great Jerry Orbach
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Phillip has made a very good 1st CD.  I guess I was a little surprised about that.  I like the folk acoustic style.  Can't wait to hear more from him.

B003VS0CYC|5.0|The first Robocop is classic cinema.  The second one is good as well and the third one is just there.  These films are good to own for those lazy days when you just want some action and you want to throw in a good movie.  Also the Blu Ray version of the first film has the unrated version where it showcases the ED 209 go crazy and blow the heck out of people.  Great scene.  It is worth owning this set just for that.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very good would suggest to someone else. Was not exactly like the movie but it was similar. Very easy go read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It's a dandy game filled with swipes &amp; sounds.  Oh, by golly this is the game for you.  ...okay enough with my silly review.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|With several different options for cruising controls, and an ad-free experience, Beach Buggy Blitz is one of those few, valuable free games.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Much better performance and screen layout user interface then the ios disaster version.<br /><br />Rumors this approach will be available on ios soon if not already there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun! My whole family plays it! I finally decided to play it today. Its so fun. Yes. It was fun. Apparently i have to do twenty words.
B008DW6VOQ|3.0|No summary for complete portfolio. Entry requires company name instead of ticker symbol. User interface could be improved eg add button for stock entry at upper right of screen too small when seen on Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Adequate.

B005K17RU0|3.0|OK but not as easy to use as wunderground. Setup not intuitive but it can be fought through to success eventually.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movies never got anywhere and was filled with raunchy talk including adults talking to minor children in inappropriate language.  One &#34;mother&#34; even called a minor boy a &#34;bitch&#34;.  Sorry we gave this movie our time and money.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Some ads interfere at times but they are bearable. Essentially mindless entertainment. Sometimes a bit tricky to adjust view width to accommodate both launch and target visibility and still angle launch reasonably well on Kindle Fire.

B00AEFXL5W|4.0|The recent Broadway musical, Breakfast At Tiffany's, moved me to see the movie again. Although it is not a musical, the film has so many scenes around NYC that it sometimes seems to sing to me. Audrey Hepburn is at her best in this film.
B00127RAJY|5.0|It arrived early and in good condition.<br />Never used a workout video before and would recommend it. She is tough but has modified them for beginners and I love the results!
B007N8RULO|4.0|Sometimes the whole suit after being formed does not move up immediately. Also, the cards do not always go where I want them to.  I downloaded the game twice - with the same results.  Great game If the kinks are worked out!!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It is probably my favorite book of all time. I'm so happy that I can have it on my Kindle now too, ready to read whenever I want!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|It has been a while since I have watched a show that sucked me in this much.  Great characters played by some great actors.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a gripping novel, written in skillful style.  I absolutely LOVED the book until the final chapters, which felt rushed and the ending unsatisfying.  I felt cheated.
B007JNWQZS|5.0|I loved them both and have watched them several times.  Started with the DVDs, but this is even better in bluRay
0425264351|5.0|The Killing Floor by Lee Child<br /><br />I am now trying to read the Jack Reacher series in order.  This is the first book in the series and provides a little more background on Jack than the later books.  Jack gets a very warm welcome on his arrival in Margrave, Georgia.  When Jack leaves the town may need to change it's name by dropping the Mar.<br /><br />Jack doesn't seem as implacable in this book as his later books.  This book does develop the characteristics that you see in the later books.  Jack strives for aloofness but when he goes in, he goes all in.<br /><br />The author appears to be a firm believer in Old Testament justice and Reacher dispenses it with a liberal hand.<br /><br />In a community that is to perfect to be real, Jack finds lust, love, friends and perfidy.  He revises his estimate of character on several people and seeks his own brand of justice.<br /><br />As in all the Jack Reacher books I have read so far, there is non-stop action and lots of violence.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and I recommend the book.<br /><br />Web Site: [...]
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Was a fairly easy read but pace was lackadaisical during many parts and plot twists were not really there.  Only engaged the reader from a historic perspective and not necessarily from the plot line or characters themselves.

B008MX7Z32|4.0|This lamp is excellent for my use (reading). Very bright.  Have also used it as a flashlight.  Only negative is it has to be charged from a USB port. No real problem since I recharge it while using my laptop.  Excellent purchase.<br /><br />Fast forward 9 mos. The lamp has failed to come on, as if the problem is the switch.  The good news is the supplier, Neon Mart, promptly replaced it with no problem. I highly recommend this supplier. Only time will tell if the 1st lamp failure was a fluke or indicative of a quality problem.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I h8 the fact that they're copying temple run.  But I still got it. I myself think its a waste of MB
B006AZZPCM|5.0|greatest viewer and downloader app there is. downloaded very quickly and efficiently.good if you need walkthroughs and have to go offline for games
B00BSBXA98|4.0|I loved watching this movie as I don't live in a city where I can go see a show anytime. The production was done well and it was &#34;almost&#34; like being in the audience to watch all of these talented performers. I say &#34;almost&#34; because everybody should make an effort to go see the show in person -- it is incredible and Guy Laliberte is a master of the imagination!
B0098QBEXO|5.0|Aside from the tragic nature of the movie, the four young men going on an outing together allowed this female viewer an opportunity to observe how men act when they are alone together.  Interesting.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|Fun Easter movie for a child. She'd give it 1000 stars.  As an adult I thought it was just ok.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|Not tense enough, failed to show Smiley's internal discovery process of the mole.  Enjoyed looking at Benedict Cumberbatch, of course.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I've only had this Anker charger for a few weeks, but it does exactly what I expected, and a little more. From a full charge I was able to charge up a dead Samsung galaxy tab to 100 % and and IPad 2 to<br /> 80 %. I got it mainly to charge up my smartphones.  I hope it continues to work this well for a while.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I don't  think it should make you be required to do a pacific person. It should let you pick your own every time. But I still love the game. Just have to find out how to win without my man Ronin!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|This isn't the most challenging game but it's fun and interesting. It is a fun way to pass the time. Wish there were more levels, though. Quite addictive!
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Once I started reading John Green, I couldn't stop. I couldn't stop laughing out loud at parts, caring about the the deeply complex characters who delight and touch my heart. I couldn't be happier about this book. For YA and PARENTS and any age if you want a touching, real, beautifully written story. Read this and all the other John Green books...I am!
B00A2V2OVK|4.0|Nice to be able to watch these old shows again.  It was still in the old 4:3 format.  But that's how it's supposed to be.
0199270295|3.0|This great thing about this book is that it is incredibly thorough, explaining everything on the basis of fundamentals. However, this shouldn't be anyone's first o-chem book. It is beyond me how the authors believe someone can get good at (or excited about) o-chem by sitting through twenty to forty page long chapters, without a single practice problem in between, and only about ten problems at the end. The book requires a very passive approach--- read, read, and read more (which can grow to be tedious). If the authors were to provide many more opportunities to practice, this might well be the best o-chem book out there. Perhaps they need to complete this masterpiece by supplementing it with a workbook.
B00009R86L|5.0|I actually used this product as extra padding on my toddler hiking backpack in order to alleviate the strain on my shoulders from carrying a nearly 40lb backpack while hiking as much as 8 miles. The pads worked great for how I used them, which I must stress are not necessarily what they are intended for, so I imagine that when used properly they are even more amazing. For some added comfort I added strips of mole skin to the inside foam area of the pad as I was wearing the straps with sleeveless shirts and was afraid the rubberish foam may cause chaffing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm addicted, but two screens have me frustrated for lack of success in getting my 3 stars!  Very challenging, which is what I love.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|This is a surprisingly great movie. Do keep in mind this does play off the common model of the comedy and romantic-comedy themes movies, but it is mush more interesting than most. If the movie had more unique bits and events to happen then it would have gotten 5 stars but it is kind of normal in that aspect.<br />That being said this movie does extremely well to keep you entertained and connected to the movie. The movie starts with a date that establishes the main character in a matter of 5 minutes or less. With it's many great comedic actors in the movie it is well worth your time watching.<br />My favorite line in the movie is \\"The Rock became Dwayne Johnson.\\" Along with that the many jokes and tradigities in this movie will have you invested dearly in this movie. I intend to watch it again.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It was great at first, I loved the graphics and all. But now whenever I try and open the game back up it doesnt want to. I reinstalled the game, amd worked fine. Until the next day, its doing the same thing over again. Ive already lost my high scores one time. I dont want to lose it again. Somebody help!! So that I may change this review.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I was very pleased with my purchase, the CD was in great shape; and although the case was a little damaged the sound was perfectly fine.
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|The jumping mechanics feel odd because you just kind of float. Levels are very repetitive and uninteresting. Deleted from my kindle after a couple of days.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|An interesting read, this book looks at the world through an introverts eyes.  It removes the usual definition of success which according to the author is defined by extroverts and supplies a more workable one for those who are wired differently.
B0000CNY27|3.0|Although the plot is quite absurd (Manhattan Island is turned into a maximum security prison, and one man must rescue the President), run with it and enjoy Kurt Russell getting into his portrayal of anti-hero Snake Plissken. There's talk of a EFNY reboot... and I'm excited and have high hopes the creative forces behind it might change things up for the better. Memorable performances by veteran actors Lee Van Cleef, Harry Dean Stanton, Donald Pleasance, Adrian Barbeau, Isaac Hayes and Ernest Borgnine color the sometimes ho-hum, slow pace of the uninspired action scenes (in my opinion the movie could have used more creative and intense/explosive action scenes). But I will credit director John Carpenter for undertaking such a monumental story that in 1980-81 must have been a daunting challenge to film to say the least. And he pulls it off utilizing effects wizardy and a bit of location smoke and mirrors. The special edition comes with funny commentaries by Carpenter and Russell, a deleted opening scene, a documentary making of, and a mini-comic book. See it and enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting. We have competitions in our family nightly. We like the different challenges you have to complete. It's a fun family game.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Hello everyone! today is Easter Sunday and my iPod died. these reviews are really important to me. Have a great Easter and read this review on Temple Run2!<br />Temple Run 2 is great! I really like the mines and doesn't lag on the Kindle as it does with the iPod. The features are so cool and it is not your average temple run. I would have gave it 5 stars if you did a boost in the beginning and weren't able to climb on the long rope but you were able to climb on another piece of the temple. otherwise great app for the family kindle fire!<br />Note To Amazon- If you and Barnes and Noble (Nook) teamed up instead of competing with each other than you would make more money than Apple. if you agree, like this coment.<br />Have a great Easter!!<br />-Syd
B006YMLE7G|3.0|I like anthro animals, and racing so this movie seemed like a really good buy.<br />How funny I actually got a survey to review a product that hasn't even shipped yet. Silly Amazon.<br />Im sure itll be very entertaining when I do receive it. Ill update this review then if it lets me, at that time :3<br />Cheers
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Lots of very useful features none of which are there as, ultimately pointless, filler. More than worth the price. Highly recommended.
0486275590|5.0|A classic adventure novel, written by Robert Louis Stevenson, tells that tale of an innkeepers son, who is in for the experience of a lifetime. Adventure falls into his hands when he discovers a map in his guest's mysterious chest. This is one novel that is not slow to start. It is a fast paced book that you can read on any trip, or with a younger family member before they go to sleep at night. I warn you that this book will leave you dreaming of pirates and treasure for the next month. This popular adventure novel consists of what every pirate tale needs. Treasure maps marked with an \\"X,\\" tropical islands never before inhabited, as well as the Black Spot and rebellious pirates and mutineers that have talking parrots and missing legs. Taking over ships and threatening lives to get the mysterious gold and jewels is only the goal of the pirates in this tale. The main character, Jim Hawkins, only wants to escape the nightmare he landed in. However, you will not want to do the same, as I was not able to put the book down.<br /><br />The main character is inspiring, trustworthy and humble as he overcomes fears and sets out on his own for the first time with bandits and thieves. You will not regret reading this book as it is anything but boring and dull. It is thrilling, sad, captivating and will leave you staying up with a flashlight in your bed to find out what happens next. I highly recommend reading this book, as it is a tale your will never forget!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was really well written and a completely different way to look at zombie outbreaks. It stays true to form by not revealing how the outbreak started but listening to individuals experiences was an intelligent way to present this. Overall it was an excellent book and I couldn't put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you are looking for a game that you can get addicted to, well here you are. When I first played this game I got real competitive and now I play it almost like24/7. I hope you enjoy this game too.

B005LAIHSG|4.0|Here's a big budget film with quite a few graphic combat scenes, swords slicing and flailing, horses whinnying, bodies dropping, all well done, with a host of special effects.  It's the fairy story of the evil queen, played nicely by Charlize Theron (who gets to appear in a zillion and one different costume and makeup sets), finally being undone by the rightful princess, who escapes her clutches and rallies the troops.  The production is well mounted, and money has been spent on this.  The script is serviceable, a bit awkward in terms of language in a couple of spots.  The film's main problem is it is WAY TOO LONG.  An hour or more could easily have been cut without losing any sense of story.  I realize these productions exist to employ Hollywood craftspeople, and this one is very well done, but the movie tends to drag as the princess must encounter a troll and hostile dwarfs and other such perils on her journey through the woods after she has escaped from the castle.  This part seems endless.  Still, Charlize Theron is a treat here.  I wish I could say the same for the actress who portrays the princess.  She's adequate, but shrewder casting could have made her seem more appealing.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is not the usual Stephen King story. No horror tale in the usual sense. It is an intriguing story of what might happen if an ordinary person had the chance to change history.
B0099114WO|1.0|Hope may spring eternal, but not for a monotonous reminder that marriages go sour from a sexual and emotional standpoint long before middle age.  Not only is this something you don't want to be reminded of when you go to the movies, but it does not, as presented, even rise to the level of engagement of a routine television soap opera.  I mean, you have Tommy Lee sleepwalking through the film, basically grunting and ignoring Meryl Streep, whose cutesy, guilty little smiles are supposed to indicate she still has an interest in rekindling the flame.  Only there really isn't much if any chemistry between them, the script is banal, and the actors seem both embarrassed at and hostile to the subject matter.  Who could blame them?  And so they seek out sex therapist Steve Carell (who seems like a wormy little guy with no real personality), and sit widely physically separated on a couch, while he asks them the usual cliched questions -- \\"do you have orgasms? do you experiment in bed?  are you ready to try something new?\\"  Could the actors possibly have read and agreed to a script this predictable and uninteresting and bad, with virtually nothing by way of characterization?  This is like a very mediocre version of Marriage Counseling 101.  There isn't a single spark in the entire movie.  I felt pained for the actors, truly, doing material this embarrassing and dull.
0525953728|5.0|Well done... informative.  Truly gripping and clears the &#34;fog&#34; over the entire incident!  We are all kept in the dark about so much that it was about time that the truth came out, at least in this situation.
1451629184|5.0|This book had special meaning to my family and me.  We as a family from all over California and Nevada had gathered at a famly members house that day for a week long trip to Yosimite.  That house was across the street and three doors down from Jaycee's home.  My neice who was Jaycee's age went to school with her.  We did not learn of the abduction until our return from Yosemite.<br />Three of us were cops and  followed the abduction case for years.  I obviously had to have a copy of this book.  The story was of course very sad but it was well written and a page turner.

0316019984|5.0|This book is filled with multiple intricate pop outs of all the DC super heroes.  We got this for our son before he could read. He enjoyed simply turning through the pages and looking at the illustrations. As he is getting older, he is enjoying listening to the stories that go along with them..
0800141660|5.0|As old eyes grow dim, and reading becomes difficult, how nice to recall the beauty of stories so dearly remembered.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Read this when I was in middle school, wanted to read it again. Wonderful story that makes you think about whether the things that we desire are truly good for us and those around us. Passing judgment too quickly can have some of the most profound effects.
B00338QENI|1.0|I read this book for our book club selection otherwise I would never have finished it. A 300 page book that should have been 100. Frankly, I found it repetitive. I think the author meant to write it so that people would know who Henrietta was. I think it was more of a diary of her research. The only parts I liked dealt with Henrietta's life. The rest was pure boredom for me.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|George C. Scott is Patton, and he and his other cast members are great! This is one of the finest films dealing with World II.  I liked everything about this movie. Great production values, etc..
B007M45PMU|5.0|If you like Indie you will love The Lumineers. They are the Real Deal... Just the three of them but they make beautiful music together.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|This follow up to , The Dark Knight, is a hit. I only wish that Heath Ledger had lived, he was an excellent actor, very talented. He should have won the Academy Award Oscar for his performance in Brokeback Mountain, because it was such a difficult role to play. However this Dark Knight Rises is a winner in so far as the story and performances and everything else.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Excellent....... Brought  lots of WILD times from college and concert going days........ Reminded when I saw them in concert back in 1980, The Start Me Up Tour......... Good times had by All !!!!!  ~

B009NYF2ES|4.0|I like it a lot and the musical numbers are superb. It is one of the best musical's of that decade.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|If you didn't love Kill Bill and are not old school karate movie fans or if you just don't get Quentin Tarantino then don't even bother seeing this movie. This is Quentin's vision in his finest fashion yet, with sequences that blew me away. The casting is right on target, as usual, and each of these stars help the movie shine. Absolutely loved it and cannot wait for more!
B0013N3DSE|5.0|One of Flynn's best, but what about a Blu-Ray version of , The Sea Hawk and Charge of the Light Brigade??? Also They Died With Their Boot's On, and Dodge City.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I chose this book because my friend suggested it, and I soon wished that I he read it before! This book is quite true to the nature of people and their faults that cause them to do things, and it can be argued that it shows the true nature all people.
B000U1ZV3U|4.0|Not as good as ,Tombstone, but not far behind. All performances good. The story and Dennis Quaid's performance as, Doc Holladay were really good.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|The Moody Blues are still fantastic, but Justin alone has the same vocal range he had 45 years ago - simply great!
B0017TYPIG|4.0|Great story good photography, and an excellent performance by George Kennedy. I was surprised to see Dennis Hopper in such a minor role, I always admired him as an actor.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I love playing this game while I'm riding in vehicles. Very entertaining! I end up traveling a lot especially during sports seasons and this game has great graphics!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Laughs all the way through and scenarios that everyone can relate to.  The cast is great and have on screen chemistry.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|I enjoyed this book to a degree. It was without a doubt a work of John Green; with the mysterious and alluring female and loser type but lovable male storyteller. However this book didn't emotionally hit me like his other novels have. I kept waiting for this big crash of emotions that never came. This book is a lot of suspense and waiting. I'd still recommend this book.
B008UG0IS0|5.0|Yet another winner from Hiromi. BRAVO!!! Remarkable and unforgettable sound. The way she plays is very unique.<br /><br /> Highly recommend to jazz lovers.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Just another walk on people's heads for Reacher.  I hope Lee Child never runs out of story lines!  About three million readers would begin wandering the waste lands in search of somebody worthy of their time.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really like this game! Irritates the heck out of me!!!! I'm 41 & find myself playing this a lot, waiting for appointments or just chillin around the house.
B000NY12CI|5.0|One of the best finds I have had on my kindle. An important book for any thinking person to read. She tells her story and that of countless others and holds nothing back.
1400069289|5.0|Great at adding to understanding of why otherwise unintelligible things happen, and how each of us can take charge of our own life. Examples help explain, so you don't have to be a psychology graduate to get it!

B003VANOFY|2.0|Very prone to interference - cut on and off often.  Almost unusable due to this problem.  Want to like them but disappointing overall.
B0099116AY|5.0|Critics praised Tommy Lee Jones' Oscar-nominated performance in Lincoln and, true, it was the only spark of life in that overblown, overrated miniseries-like yawnfest, but it is in Hope Springs that he really shines and comes out towering.  Predictably, people kept raving about Meryl Streep because praising Meryl Streep is like praising Steven Spielberg - it seems to be required even though deep down you tell yourself, well, were they really that great this time? Oh, don't get me wrong, Meryl was just fine, but she was upstaged here by Tommy Lee Jones. She seemed in awe of Tommy Lee throughout the film and the press they did for Hope Springs (and she will work with him again in his next directorial effort, The Homesman). Her awe of him was appropriate because you really believe that Kay loves her husband Arnold with all her heart - it helped that Meryl had an actor with tremendous presence who was not only as highly skilled as she is but was truly touching and attractive, someone who can infuriate you one moment and make you want to take care of him the next. People forget that back in the 80s Tommy Lee Jones was a woman's supporting actor - that's how I came to know of him. In real life he is the Harvard scholar son of a former police woman in Texas and consequently, no doubt, has a healthy respect for women that shows through on the screen. I didn't grow up with the big barker of The Fugitive or the stone-faced K of the MIB films - I grew up with tender-hearted Tommy Lee Jones warmly backing up Sissy Spacek in Coal Miner's Daughter or Sally Field in Back Roads (underrated gem - check it out) or Jessica Lange in Blue Sky. What you have here in Hope Springs is a fusion of the Big Barker and the Tender Heart - Tommy Lee as Arnold undergoes a rite of passage. He has taken his wife for granted, lives his life by rote - and one day she makes him wake up and see that they need passion in their marriage, something to look forward to, and he undergoes a transformation thatis truly touching. And of course his dry wit shows through in the marriage counseling scenes - isn't the phrase 'Tommy Lee Jones in sex therapy' enough of a selling point?.  He is a true joy to watch. Check out this film and the other films I mentioned, and you'll see that it is too simple to label Tommy Lee Jones as nothing but a grumpy curmudgeon or barker. But if you must label him as a curmudgeon, well, he is the most lovable one since Henry Fonda in On Golden Pond.
B00778G8Z4|5.0|Nice interesting movie. Great special effects ! It tells a nice story. A great sci fi movie that should be watched !
B00AZKCU7G|1.0|I gave up on Steven Spielberg a long time ago. IMAO, the man hasn't made a truly great film since E.T. I slaved through Lincoln (no pun intended) to watch my favorite actor, Tommy Lee Jones, and another one of my favorite actors, James Spader. They were predictably great as always (although Tommy Lee gave a more Oscar-calibur performance in last year's Hope Springs). When Jones and Spader weren't on, I was pulling my hair out from boredom. How many different ways can you say slavery is wrong, we are all equal, and we must get the 13th amendment passed? I can't tell the difference between this overblown thing and an old made-for-tv miniseries. For a far more colorful, original, dynamic filmmaking experience about slavery, watch Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. Now that's CINEMA! IMAO, Tarantino is by far our greatest living filmmaker, not Spielberg!
B001992NUQ|5.0|How do you rate a film like this? This is easily within my top 5 films of all time. I love the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. I'm so glad I got such a great deal.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The magical realism tugs you into the swirl of the adventure. The story telling is so tight, well narrated that it was as if you yielded to those childish dreams and ran away to the circus.  You'll love all of the characters and root for a happy outcome and Erin does not disappoint! Loved the book, fantastic read.
B0021L8UQ2|4.0|I'm not at all a fan of &#34;American horror/thriller&#34; films. I bought this based on reviews. It wasn't bad! Although I had certainly seen better films. The price was pretty cheap. Overall, I'm glad I took a chance.

B004LROMQG|5.0|For a follower of the series, you couldn't ask for more! The additional DVD contains out takes and cast interviews.  A nice bonus!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it has a lot of cool things but it needs to have a rollacostoer or a cool ride like for real.

0553381709|5.0|Which book in the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire written by George R.R. Martin is the best? Many would argue that the third entry in the series, A Storm of Swords, is the most likely candidate. There is no question that it is the largest of the four books published to date; in fact, in England it was published in two volumes (Steel and Snow and Blood and Gold).<br /><br />At Amazon.com  A Storm of Swords has 822 reviews, with an average of 4.50365 (90.07%) with 76.6% of reviews selecting the top 5 star review. The book preceding A Storm of Swords is A Clash of Kings and it has a slightly higher average review of 4.50857 (90.17%) but they are less numerous (700) and has a lower percentage of 5-star reviews (71.6%). The first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, is the most well-known, naturally, since it was published first. It has by far the most number of reviews, 1,840 with an average of 4.38587 with 71% being 5-star reviews. The fourth book, A Feast for Crows, is the least popular book of the series so far and most harshly reviewed (an average score of 3.206557 based on 915 reviews). The fifth, A Dance with Dragons, will be released on July 12, 2011.<br /><br />I would generally agree with the crowd at Amazon.com that A Storm of Swords is the best book of the first four in the A Song of Ice and Fire series that I have read so far.<br /><br />The book's impact is not just based on it's length, though, as in most things, size does matter. There are so many important, stunning and horrifying plot twists which affect the characters we have grown to love and hate that several times I had to re-read sections of the book because I was reading so quickly to find out what was going to happen I realized I had missed an important event that had happened.<br /><br />In this third book in the series the story that began in A Game of Thrones has progressed in surprising directions. It is almost impossible to review this volume without giving away important plot developments which a first-time reader should really experience unspoiled. I can say that the structure of the book follows the form of the previous entries in the series, with point-of-view chapters from various characters following one another seamlessly to reveal the overall storyline. There are POV chapters from Lannisters (Jaime, Tyrion and Cersei), Starks (Catelyn, Sansa, Arya and Bran) and their associates (Daavos Seaworth, Samwell Tarly, Jon Snow). Daenerys Targaeryen also returns and makes progress towards establishing herself as a true Queen of Westeros far away in the East.<br /><br />The main storylines (internecine political conflict in King's Landing, Jon's foray beyond The Wall to learn the truth about the wildlings, Daenerys' quest for an Army and a crown, the impact of the War of Five Kings on Westeros' citizens as experienced by several of our main characters) are told with expert deftness and intriguing suspense. You literally do not know who will survive or perish, even if they have a chapter named after them (hint!).<br /><br />Some say that Martin is trying to dethrone J.R.R. Tolkien as the universally acknowledged king of fantasy, and it may be true. Others say that Martin may actually have higher aims such as joining Shakespeare in the canon of literature. I'll leave it up to future readers to decide, but the decision of whether or not to invest the time and energy to read these books should be an easy one for anyone who delights in the pleasure of fiction itself.<br /><br />Title: A Storm of Swords.<br />Author: George R.R.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I Really Like This Game And It's Super Fun To Play. I Have Not Gotten A Lot Of Bingos, But It's Still Fun
0345535413|5.0|A Clash of Kings is the sequel to A Game of Thrones (see MadProfessah's other reviews) in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire award-winning fantasy series. The first book has been adapted to the source material for HBO's first season of its televised adaptation called Game of Thrones (which debuted Sunday April 17th., 2011)<br /><br />A Clash of Kings is an astonishing achievement. It is a gigantic book, chock full of battles, betrayals and brutalities. The main plot of the story is \\"The War of the Five Kings.\\" With King Robert Barratheon dead, there are five men claiming the Iron Throne: Joffrey Baratheon, the teenaged son of his Queen, the evil Cersei Lannister; Renly Baratheon, Robert's handsome younger brother; Stannis Baratheon, Robert's stern older brother; Robb Stark, son of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell and self-proclaimed King of the North; and Balon Greyjoy, who has declared himself King of the Iron Islands.<br /><br />The story in A Clash of Kings follows immediately the events at the end of  A Game of Thrones. Events are told from the perspectives of each of several characters, both familiar and new. Many of our favorites from the first book, such as Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Daenerys Targaryen and Catelyn Stark return with chapters of their own. Of course, there are also chapters told from the perspective of new characters such as Davos Seaworth (who is in the employ of Stannis Baratheon) and Theon Greyjoy (son of Balon Greyjoy who grew up with the Stark children at Winterfell). Additionally, Arya's sister Sansa Stark has some chapters devoted to her perspective as well which make her a far less annoying character than she appeared to be in the first book.<br /><br />Martin is pretty ruthless with the fates of his characters. One never knows who will survive, even if they are a character who has a chapter named after them. This feature of the book greatly increases the level of suspense for the reader and the emotional impact of the story on the reader.<br /><br />Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire is truly one of the great masterpieces of speculative fiction, a sprawling, messy, detailed work of art which will delight and despair readers for decades.<br /><br />Title: A Clash of Kings.<br />Author: George R.R.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The book was a great insight. I believe this will make a difference from here on out in the way we relate to each other in our marriage. A good and lasting marriage does take work and sacrifice and giving, now this will be a bit easier, after all we got married to be happy and forever!!<br />I would recommend this book to everyone. It is about relationship , whether single or married. We need to understand ourselves in order to love and understand others in our lives.
0553386794|5.0|Thanks to a friend on GoodReads.com, I was convinced to ask for A Game of Thrones for Chrismuhkwanzukkah, and received it. I had heard about the series A Song if Ice and Fire and was aware that HBO is going to start airing a miniseries called Game of Thrones in April 2011.<br /><br />Variety reports that there are over 4.5 million copies of the first four books in the series in print and it has recently been announced that the fifth book A Dance with Dragons will be released on July 12, 2011. Many fans of the series are pretty bitter because the fourth book in the series, A Feast for Crows was released in November 2005 and they have been eagerly awaiting new material for well over 5 years. And the entire series is said to consist of seven books.<br /><br />It all started with the first book, A Game of Thrones, and this idea of political intrigue surrounding who will rule the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros is a central theme of the book and the series. The setting is one akin to medieval Europe with very little technology beyond the Bronze Age, although magic plays a limited role and one of the most important features is that seasons can last for years. In A Game of Thrones summer has lasted for nearly a decade, but the longer-lived people realize that this may augur an equally long bitter winter. The phrase \\"Winter is Coming\\" is a common catch phrase of the people of the North, and reveals their pessimism (some would say stoicism) about the future.<br /><br />Martin has embarked upon an incredibly ambitious,m sprawling work of high fantasy. He tells his story in discrete chapters with the names and point of view of a single character. This can result in  major events of the story being revealed multiple times, from differing viewpoints or sometimes an important development for one character is revealed from a casual remark made by another. It's a compelling device, and it requires close attention by the reader. These are generally gigantic books (on the order of 900 pages) with literally dozens and dozens of characters with complex and complicated familial and familiar ties.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones sets the stage for the entire series by introducing our two main protagonists: a set of families and rivals called the Starks (of the North) and the Lannisters (of the South). The Starks are dark-haired, simple and stoic while the Lannisters and blonde, green-eyed, wealthy and ruthless. In the beginning it is clear the reader is intended to identify with the Starks, as we are first introduced to the entire family: Lord Eddard Stark, his wife Catelyn Stark and their five children (Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon) as well as Eddard's bastard son, John Snow. The Lannisters primarily consist of Lord Tywin Lannister and his three children (Jaime, Cersei and Tyrion). Cersei is married to Eddard Stark's best friend King Robert Baratheon and has borne him three children while carrying out an adulterous and incestuous affair with her brother Jamie. Tyrion is a deformed dwarf more commonly known as the Imp.<br /><br />As a Black, gay reader one of the most noticeable aspects of the books is the treatment of gender and regulation of sexuality. Homosexuality is barely mentioned, but the expectation of each gender are rigidly defined. The morals of the time strongly condemn all sex outside of marriage, although they only barely look askance as abortion/contraception (there is a special tea women can take soon after having sex which is supposed to prevent them from getting pregnant). Women are basically property of their husbands, and daughters are just there to be married off while her \\"maidenhood\\" (or virginity) is intact in order to seal connections between  Lords and prominent families, which are called Houses. There are a dizzying array of various Houses, the most prominent for our purposes are House Stark and House Lannister, each with their own castle, Winterfell and Casterly Rock, respectively.<br /><br />Martin hooks you into caringfor the main characters early on and the plot twists and turns which delight and horrify. Just because the Starks are our putative heroes does not mean that everything will end \\"happily ever after.\\" Plus, for most readers, there are so many named characters that almost any reader can find at least one (if not more) that they can identify with and root for.<br /><br />I don;t want to give away or discuss the details of the plot, but suffice it to say that you will not be disappointed if you take the time to visit Westeros and watch the Game of Thrones from the comfort of your home, reveling in Martin's imagination.<br /><br />Title: A Game of Thrones<br />Author: George R.R.

B000SEI230|5.0|Intensely beautiful!!!! The ending made me want to cry and scream for joy all at once!!!! Definitely one of my favorites, it really makes you realize what true love is. I also love the mix of God into this book not preachy just allowing you to see the characters view as well as decide your own
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very Enjoyable game, brings Back Memories Of The Old Arcade GAmes. definitely worth The Download. Super Super Easy Controls. yea
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is one of the best books that I've read in years.  It reads like a top-of-line novel, but it's all true and you can't help but cheer for Adam Brown.  It's a must read for anyone who wants to see someone overcome his difficulties and rise beyond his expectations.
B000EMSU6A|5.0|This album from two prominent members of the Who and The Small Faces, is really a little gem.<br /><br />For Ronnie Lane the album came at a point in his career when his Slim Chance project more or less econimically lay in ruins; and worse his multiple sclerosis had just been diagnosed.<br /><br />For Pete Townshend this project came between the albums \\"The Who By Numbers\\" and \\"Who Are You\\", which tragically turned out to be the last to feature drummer Keith Moon.<br /><br />\\"Rough Mix\\" is brilliantly produced by Glyn Johns, and the songwriting is more or less equally divided between Lane and Townshend. For Lane this could very well be his most consistent post Small Faces album release, and his songs are great. Especially \\"Nowhere to Run\\", \\"Annie\\" and \\"April Fool\\" stand out. His songs have great relaxed folkish feel, and he has pleasant voice, not unlike George Harrison.<br /><br />Townshend's songs are great too. I particularly like \\"Keep Me Turning\\", which is both complex and catchy.<br /><br />Lane and Townshend are supported by eaqually prominent friends such as Eric Clapton, Charlie Watts, John Bundrick, Ian Stewart, John Entwistle, Graham Lyle and Benny Gallagher, to mention some of the most significant.<br /><br />The album received good reviews, but it was not promoted very much and consequently did not sell very well.<br /><br />Should appeal to fans of both the Who and the Small Faces.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I was surprised.  Better than Argo.  Not as good as Lincoln.  Lots of suspense and action even though I knew the story in detail.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I love the way Jackon makes movies. As a long time fan of the books, I am thrilled that he had the courage to  make this movie.  Once again Jackson did not disappoint; the Hobbit was new and familiar at the same time and thoroughly satisfied.
B0091REZMW|4.0|love this game but don't like how you need to purchase diamonds to really get anywhere in the game unless you have a lot of patience!
B008RV5K4U|4.0|It has been a while since I read the graphic novel but I thought the video stayed true to it.I would say any true Batman fan should see it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Enigmatis is a good mystery wrapped in a fun hidden object game. It has an easy or expert mode, so it's challenging even for experienced gamers. It is well worth the price, or try it for free if you're not sure you'll like it. After the first 5 minutes, I was hooked!
1401324649|4.0|This is a fun and easy read, that will make you laugh and take you on a quick trip trough last century without pretending to be a very serious history book. The feels is much like Forrest Gump, only this time the man is from Sweden.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|well done - though some swearing language, it's not offensive.  very enjoyable movie.<br />this was the third time viewing this movie.
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should be embarrassed to have this movie, the most over-hyped film since The Matrix, in it's ranks as a Best Picture nominee.  No character development.  Not realistic in any way.  I only pushed through the horrific, slow, and poorly acted first 2 hours hoping to see a somewhat exciting conclusion, which it did not deliver.  Seeing Andy Dwyer, from Parks and Recreation, was the only highlight of the movie...and that one guy that played with glow sticks.<br /><br />Worst storytelling of the year.  Howard the Duck had better and more realistic action sequences.<br /><br />This director is the most overrated director.  The Hurt Locker was horrendous as well.  I think she learned to direct watching Bob Saget's America's Funniest Home Videos from the 80s.<br /><br />I'm disgusted.  This is my first and probably only Amazon review.  My disgust and disappointment drove me to vent in written form.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I had a hard time getting into the book.  In fact, only read part 1.  My book club had mixed reviews.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|OMG! I laughed so many times while reading this book.  There  was plenty of suspense too,it kept me reading we'll past my bedtime. I was cheering every time our \\"hero\\" survived something that should have killed him. I stumbled across this book and after reading the sample had to buy it. 99 cents. Loved the log entry style of writing. Looking for more by this author, would love to read more about this character  and could totally see this as a movie.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|At first I thought I wouldn't enjoy this book.  But as I read the author's style, I found myself enjoying it and anticipating the next letter.The author, Mary Ann Shaffer, made you feel if you were part of the events.  Our book club is reading this novel now.  I can't wait to discuss it.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The movie is as close to the book as I have seen.Tolken fans will love it.Special effects are awsome.Will be one of the greats.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|At first I thought this book was a &#34;typical Nicholas Sparks book&#34;.  But it had a twist that I hadn't expected.<br />Our book club will discuss this book on April 20th.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|I am so tired, frankly, of all the \\"heroines\\" in children's films.  I mean, where are characters that are kids I can identify with, kids that sound like kids and act like kids?  Sure I was sometimes \\"brave\\" and \\"fearless\\" as a child, but not always!  I wish Disney would stop making that a \\"requirement\\" for all female characters.  I mean, enough already, we aren't all Joan of Arc, and even then not always.<br /><br />I happened to chance upon this playing a few weeks ago on Disney, and I absolutely fell in love with Alice and this story!  It has a perfect blend of almost scary oddness, even bordering on insanity, like Lewis Carroll's story itself, but, thanks to the era this was made, it does NOT go over the top and leave you or your child freaked out.  I thought the dialogue was excellent, and the characters all adorable, even when they are being a little \\"freaky\\".  That's the charm of the story!  But it is Alice herself, that I just loved.  She has a believable and charming amount of pluckiness alternating with just plain fear and sadness.  (who wouldn't?)  When she breaks down and cries at her plight, I felt it tug my heartstrings, it was just 'real' sounding.<br /><br />After Mowgli and the Jungle Book characters, 101 Dalmations, this is now one of my Disney favorites, and Alice is one of my favorite characters of all time.  I highly recommend!  Girls especially, will like Alice in Wonderland.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|You never have to worry about a battery with this watch and if you a very active person it'll keep itself wind my ylur movements. Its a good looking watch as well.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies for years!<br /><br />There is something about this movie that just really gets to me.<br /><br />There is a couple of sad parts (yes, I cried...) but it is also a real &#34;feel good&#34; movie as well.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I had never seen this show and find it hard to pay to watch something that had been on TV for free but my daughter talked me into it and I'm glad she did.  Now I have the DVR set to record repeats of Season 3 and will likely have to pay for Season 2 to get caught up.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I loved the details it had. Some of my friends thought it was a little slow.  I just gingerly replied that maybe it was Lincoln for dummies.  But I still loved it.  I think Sally Fields should have gotten an oscar also.  The way both Daniel and Sally did the scenes that Mary had depression was most representative as to what I have read. Sally was an awesome Mary. She even gained weight for the movie so you know she really wanted the part, I have read where people say Lincoln and Mary were codependnt - well, I say they were cosupportive - what every married couples should be. Gonna buy it so I can watch it again.
B008P9M614|5.0|This is the best set of dvds one could possibly have. All of House MD in a pack. Cant wait to watch it all over again!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun just not enough energy to keep playing the game but other than that its great will keep playing hopefully more updates
B003TSEEDY|5.0|As I have stated before in other book reviews I usually don't read fiction. This book was recommended to my by a friend, and I found myself really enjoying it. It is a coming of age story, and I found it quite interesting. It was hard to put the book down to go to sleep because you just want to read one more chapter, and then one more chapter just to find out what is going to happen.<br />This book is very light hearted, and fun to read. Highly recommend if you are looking for a light hearted fun book to read
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Slow to start but enjoyed reading. Did not like ending but will read book 2 & 3 for sure next
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I have a 9 year old son who loves watching the Jurassic Park trilogy. He never seems to get tired of watching these movies over and over again. I found a used copy of the trilogy on Amazon and he couldn't wait for the to arrive. So far he has watched each of them about 6 times a piece. These movies are great, with great plots. The used copies that I purchased came exactly as described I'm excellent conditions
B007EECSFA|4.0|Well written! The reader is transported to pre-war, war-time and post-war England. The characters are completely fleshed out and believable. I found myself unable to put down this story of love, atonement,  tragedy and redemption.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Although I couldn't quite relate to this family, I appreciated the more realistic view of what can go on behind the facade of suburban normalcy at mid-life. If you're looking for a true follow up to Knocked Up then you'll be disappointed, but if you can look at the same characters without expectations, you'll probably enjoy it.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good book to read following 50 Shades....on to the next Crossfire novel. Can't wait to see what happens next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the BEST Trilogy I have read in years!! The author must have known I wouldn't be able to put this down. I spent many days sleep deprived.LOL. Well written. Read the whole trilogy in about 2 weeks. Loved it.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I enjoyed this book but found it  a very dark read, but was very pleased to get to the end!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was recommended by some friends. I guess most of it was easy to follow and I understand the storyline--I just didn't like the abuse. I didn't buy sequel. Same thing over and over. Figured out the ending of saga by reviews.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Show is great in terms of cinematography/dialogue/action. It just got a little too slow at times but the show is solid.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love the fact that I was able to download this game for my Grandkids. They love it! And the fact that it was free was even better!!
B00BESNKB8|3.0|I love most of the actors, is that the director playing the man with iron fists?  Because his acting is horrible!  Everyone else in the movie played their parts wonderfully, that guy...can't act.  Some favors must have been owed for that to happen.  Too bad...it had potential to be a classic kung-fu style with a modern twist
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was this best series of books that I have read in a long time. The author keeps you on edge to the very end. Movie not as good as book trilogy.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|I think most action fans are more impressed that Sly got all those stars together in one movie, than they are with the movie itself.  Was there a plot...don't remember.  Had to watch it just to see all the greats in one film.  If you like action dudes beating each other up...this will pass the time.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I would recommend this game for anyone that enjoys a challenge. Need lots of eye-hand coordination though. Grandkids put me to shame!! LOL
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|He is a great actor, however the movie spent too much time focusing on his bad choices and didn't really develop anywhere else.  It became predictable...making the movie seem to go long....
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I can't stand that since the update I have a constant stream of errors telling me it can't log in even though the login is fine.  I am uninstalling.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|Done very well, Entire family thought this was cute, everyone stills blurts out the occasional &#34;blah, blah, blah&#34; around the house.  Good movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't usually read NA novels but recently I've gone through a stage when I've been reading alot of them and I can honestly say that \\"Hopeless\\" is not only the best NA novel I've read but also ranks up their with some of the best books I've read. I loved the unpredictability of the plot, the way the reader instantly fell in love with the characters. This book consumed me; long after I'd finished reading it, it's beautiful, heartbreaking storyline stayed with me. If you're looking for a book that will make you laugh out loud, dreamily sigh at the romantic bits and cry your eyes out through the hard and painful bits, this is a definite must-read.
B002S45V32|4.0|Just an all around Classic Movie about a poor girl who ends up with a rich kid in highschool. Touching actually.
B005TMSN4E|4.0|Again, Nikon has a well made product that works well and is of high quality.  Please note, that you can not use Auto mode in your camera with this adapter and must use Program mode.  Not really an issue and certainly auto meters and focuses as you would expect / want.  The only issue, which is caused by Nikon's reversed threading of lens mounts, is if you use a tripod a fair amount and also use a quick remove plate attached to the adapter, you can not remove the adapter from the camera, until you unthread the quick mount.  Because Nikon has reverse thread, it turns towards the battery grip and bumpts into it and wont turn far enought to uncouple.  Minor issue, but if you were in a hurry to switch from full-size lens to compact lens, you would certainly miss the shot.
B00B0U2SEA|4.0|This movie has a very good cast and it depicts an important part of history. I was interested from beginning to end.
B001HBZ9WA|4.0|I got this for my dad who is a big Alan Parsons Project fan and he liked it a lot. He gives it 4-5 stars.
B00AMPY54U|5.0|According to many fans, the FANDANGO album was the pinnacle of Herb Alpert's solo works.  The production and musicianship, combined with the stylistic elements of Latin pop, jazz and orchestral arrangements along with a heavier bassline (yet still reminiscent of his earlier Tijuana Brass recordings) made for one polished, exciting work of art.<br />It was initially released on vinyl and cassette in 1982, and on CD about a year later, but subsequently went out of production around 1988.  Some 25 years later, it is available once again for all of those who were not able to hear it initially.  The new CD has been remastered and has new liner notes from Herb Alpert as well.  If you are a Herb Alpert fan at all, this CD is a &#34;must have&#34; in your collection!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was quick read because it kept your interest. I can't wait to start the next one.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|This was not very engrossing or muc h fun.  T he hidden objects were too hard to find. I used the hint to find an object and it could not be touched so the game was over before I had much play time...don't waste your money.
030758836X|5.0|There is a reason this story has been on the bestseller list for so long...I couldn't put it down and the plot's twists and turns were great! I recommend this for anyone who likes a good mystery !
B008C1O8CA|2.0|big disappointment when listening to the latest cd from green day. i must say that the power in lrics and especially music is gone..pity as this has been one of my favorite bands for a long time
0812984412|2.0|My bookclub agreed to read this novel and only 2 of us were able to finish it. The chapters were too unrelated, the presentation was confusing and the story was ultimately very unsatisfying. I watched the movie and even that did not help. I cannot recommend this book.
B004IFYMWK|3.0|it brought back all the reasons why i left dc having lived there during the bush/cheney era.<br /><br />marginal --rent, do not buy
B001UAX56A|4.0|Good music..I had this album l Iong time ago and decided to get it again. I love the song Zion.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Makes my brain work while staying calm about it. Really charming game. Also, some of the &quot;achievements&quot; are funny. Some of them are consolation prizes...
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|On the whole I enjoyed this game. Finished it easily without difficulty. It's not very long but still worth the money. I always have fun with G5 games.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Michael C ALWAYS writes a good story. I do not know of one I did not like. Some better than others. So, what's new.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book! Buy it!!! Like this book is amazing I just couldn't put it down. Definitely a great book, enjoy
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a great show! My wife & I finally took on the endeavor to &#34;jump aboard&#34;, starting at the beginning of season 1, and give this popular show a try. We blew through all 3 seasons quickly! Such a fun thing to do together in the evenings. Seasons 1 & 2 were free for streaming with a Prime membership- Season 3 set us back $15. By accident, I purchased the standard resolution download and, frankly, I couldn't tell the difference in quality from the more expensive HD version we'd previously streamed. Can't wait for next January and the start of season 4!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|This is the best music I have heard in a long time and my husband and I could listen to it all day. the use of the instruments is terrific.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really cool game, the best part is is that its free. So even if you don't like it you wont waste a penny.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|it had a lot of good graphics and it keeps your high scores. other race games dont.it takes a lot of time to get enough money for stuff
B00881VLCE|5.0|Lots of good pictures and many, many free ones to do.  Was glad to find this and prices are reasonable too.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|This is a masterpiece in the making ! Mood music, quaity singing and more ! Highlights include, Next, Dirty Diana and Outside.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I didn't buy it yet is it the same as the computer are there any changes because btd4 was a little different on pocket
B0068LYEHA|4.0|Enjoyed the book but felt the editor should have had her pen out during the first 100 pages. It got better the further into the book you went.
8866130915|5.0|I wasn't sure at first because I bought the wrong one.  I wanted the bigger one.  But this tiny one has worked out great for me.  I put a pen in the middle of it and just wrap the band around  it and of course it will fit in any purse for me.  My appointments have dwindled recently too so, I just didn't need the bigger one anymore.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|So many books will be written. Already there are different accounts (and I've read them), but I think this an honest, humble narrative that accurately describes one of the greatest special operations missions ever. Great read. Excitement and adrenaline throughout.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|The special affects where great the setting alright given it must of been like 25 years since that part of the 1982 version was seen.But I have to be honest it was bad prequal some times do alright but this did not.I mean the monster or alien in 82 was different and there was no report of A chopper in the area and that it went down.More importantly in the prequal ther A female american scientist that's called to the site and at the end of the movie when the space craft is revealed from the ice she's survives but no sign her or her body in the 82 version.As I said poor planning.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I just finished watching it, and it is so real I'm considering suicide again. Perhaps if you're young you might get a laugh or two, but if you're forty or more, you know it's all true except the totally unreal TV ending. It makes me realize why our bodies and minds were designed to die at 40, and that the best thing I ever did was get a vasectomy as soon as I was of age. I bet there will never be a \\"This is 50\\", or \\"This is 60\\".
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Sometimes you just want a game that allows you to think about something else while you play the game.  This is that kind of game.  I can listen to the news and play, let my mind wonder and play and still have fun.  I enjoy it as a break so I can clear my mind.<br /><br />The problem is you don't want to stop playing.  I try to beat my time with each game and sometimes I play so long, my eyes take time to adjust to the real world after playing.
0821221841|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband that just got a new Canon Rebel 4i.  The book teaches photography tricks for all levels of understanding.  My husband has enjoyed experimenting with the new photography techniques he has learned.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was a page turner, as usual, with an occasional twist and turn!<br />Can't wait for the next book!  I have read everything that Grisham has written!
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This is a fantastic read. Both hopeful and saddening at the same time. An interesting take on humanities last journey.
B0026S93C0|5.0|I watched this movie again for the music. Always interesting to go back a watch a movie that you enjoyed from the past
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book.  A bit predictable....but overall a good book.  I will read other books by the same author. Hopefully they will be as interesting and dramatic as the Defending Jacob.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have found this game to be fun.  While it isn't. The most difficult game, at times it does present a challenge.  I like it.
B001HBWY8M|5.0|Love love love the story behind this movie.  London is also one of my favorite cities in the world. &#60;3

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a really a fun game.The colors are bright, and the paths for the pipes are challenging.I would recommend it to anyone
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|I typically prefer games that are more creepy and mysterious, but I enjoyed this game. Pretty graphics and fun puzzles.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Good job this one and plenty of action, sounds real good through my new sound system and big theater screen.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy pqlying this game.I think its worth the download. for anybody who likes this kind of game, I recommend this one. its sure is fun.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I  played It and it was ok i mean I didn't like the graphics that much you should get if you like bilding stuff other than that sk not get it.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|it is a good movie, quite entertaining. Don`t expect any dept in the story though, it is just a good time movie, sit back and enjoy.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Rating movies is all about personal preference, so this may not help a lot of people.  This is a great story about a great guy.  If you like surfing, then this is a must see.<br /><br />I purchased the DVD for someone special, and because the location and time have special meaning to us.
0091922348|5.0|I love the format of the book. I love the size of the book. I love the pictures in the book. I love the text written in red letters. I love the bright ideas on how to do a salady tasty and I LOVE all the sweet recipes! Even the package were the book arrived was amazing! Looked like Christmas! I already did the orange polenta cake and made a lot of fans! Also tried the Meringues (with Orange flower water) and they come out of the owen perfect!  Thank you to teach me how to do celeriac palatable! Great book!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I liked one but part two is more addictive.  The first one glitches and I have not had any issues with two.  The graphics are better and bigger.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|So much better then the first. So many new things we found out. I'll continue reading the novel. Love it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best seasen of walking dead by far I loved it more then a lot of tv shows I only need three more letters
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is the best.it prime the same thing as temple run,but kiddie style.I like temple run the original and temple run 2.IT better and nicer.it has a lot of action
B005K17RU0|5.0|very accurate easy to navagate , I like the the differant location.s avalable. the full clour screen make it easy to read
B005HSL626|5.0|This is an awesome game. It is totally free so don't worry about money. All you do is slice fruit with whichever blade you choose. There are different backgrounds that you can choose from. There are three different modes and several ways to unlock different blades. The only thing is that it gets a bit repetative. I highly recommend it for people looking for something good to occupy free time. Otherwise download it and see for yourself what the game is. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
0316228532|1.0|I am sad that the author went for such pathetic subject matter, and I regret every minute I wasted trying to read this book. I found no redeeming qualities whatsoever. If I could, I would ask for my money back, but I ordered it for the kindle. Anyway, steer clear.
B000YJ54DU|2.0|This one was not the best of he series, it was rather boring compared to the others.  OK BUT NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITES
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is one of the beast books I've ever read because Rick riordan wrote it and I think that demigods are very cool
B008478VE8|3.0|I write as a Christian-reviewer. Happy-clapper, Bible-believing, tongues speaking Christian. I find it very difficult to argue with people about Darwin's theories when I haven't read them myself, So, now I have.
B0047VSW30|3.0|the real message was fragmented, and did not properly contrast the &#34;power&#34; vis the &#34;love&#34; forces that were working in the community at that time. Further, it did not include the outcome of the story, ie .. prescribed religion vis freedom of heart religion.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|To phrase this the way the main character, Mark Watney, might say it:  \\"Hell yeah this was a great story; a ****ing great story.\\"  I purchased the Audible audio book version - then the Kindle version afterwards just to have it.  $0.99 - Andy Weir!!  This was better than most novels I've read in a long time, 99 cents is a steal!!<br /><br />I'm glad I was finally able to enjoy this story, and I am glad I did the audible version.  I am a huge fan of \\"Realistic SciFi\\" and this fits the bill!! I know many people got bogged down with all the \\"math\\" in this story, so listening to the Audible version helps, you can just half listen to some of that.  I don't know how many hours Andy Weir spent working out all these scenarios but it must have been a lot, but I'm sure he enjoyed it.  Then the narrator, R.C. Bray, WOW, he did a great job.  I bet he's got almost as many voices than Rich Little!  It really helps immerse you into the story.  Sure, the females sounded a bit like Alec Baldwin, but I liked that in a strange sort of way :)<br /><br />I listened to most of this on a 1,200 mile trip to Florida.  Once we reached the point where it started to get warm, we discovered our AC wasn't working.  When the kids started to complain I wanted to tell them: \\"After what Mark Watney had to endure on his trip to Schiaparelli I don't want to hear you bleeping whine about a little AC problem.\\"  Of course I didn't but I did turn on the 70's station and made them listen to disco the rest of the way!  You'll know why that's funny when you read or listen to the story.<br /><br />Andy Weir has many great one liners; probably the best is \\"Yes, of course duct tape works in a near-vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped!\\"<br /><br />Fair warning - you must be grown up enough to handle a fair amount of cuss words, and the F-bomb a lot, but the story is great, and the narration is awesome!!  The ending is classic!<br /><br />By the way, if this were to be madeinto a movie, it would totally put \\"Mission to Mars\\" to shame! TOTALLY<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005HI4LLY|5.0|\\"Tucker & Dale vs. Evil\\" takes the redneck backwoods horror premise and spins it on its grizzled head.  Tucker and Dale are a couple of well-meaning rednecks on their way into the deep woods to hang out at their ramshackle vacation home together.  A group of preppy-type college kids see them at a local convenience store and assume that they are a couple of redneck maniacs out to get them.  Things get even worse when one of the good 'ole boys decides to approach one of the sorority sisters and ask her out on a date.  He's extremely nervous and awkward and comes off as pretty creepy so this only fortifies the college kids' assumptions about the redneck buddies.  This is the beginning of a collision course between the well-meaning good 'ole boys and their preppy nemeses who assume nothing but the worst about them.  This  movie is hilarious with lots of crazy splatter effects as the college kids are killed off one-by-one.  In just about every case the college kids' deaths are caused by their own stupidity.  Despite all its goofiness the film has a message about the importance of not judging a book by its cover.  In less talented hands, the movie could have just come off as just stupid instead of a movie with a brain and a heart.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|its a great movie to watch and has great songs. enjoy watching it with friends and family. Very funny movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great show for our family.  It's funny and the story like was just right for the little ones to under stand.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great insight into the life of today's snipers. Chris Kyle's humility and honesty is very inspiring. Even if you aren't into war or history books, this is still a good book to read.
0743277708|5.0|This book is known as a classic.  I work with rabbits at a local SPCA and many have asked me if I'd read it.  I finally got a copy and did.  It was truly great.

B0031TZASY|5.0|This novel justifies the awards that it received. A really intense story. The descriptions of the times on the lifeboat, although fantastic, are written in such a way to make it believable.
0143035711|5.0|As a combat infantry veteran (aka \\"Grunt\\") of the Vietnam War I can fully appreciate this author's work.  The concept of using helicopters as the primary means of inserting, supporting and extracting ground troops into hostile jungle territory was initiated in 1965 by the 1st Cavalry Division, dubbed \\"Airmobile\\" for this reason.  The most famous \\"test\\" of this concept occurred at Landing Zones X-Ray and Albany in the Ia Drang Valley during November of that year under the command of Lt. Col. Harold \\"Hal\\" Moore, and is documented in both his written work and the highly acclaimed movie \\"We Were Soldiers.\\"  Mr. Mason served as a Warrant Officer / Pilot of the infamous \\"Huey\\" helicopter during this as well as countless other Combat Assault and other missions.<br /><br />Mason's writing is masterful; entertaining, highly credible and convincing.  He takes us with him through the rigors of \\"chopper school\\" and subsequently half way around the world to Vietnam where he witnesses and experiences the sheer brutality of war.  Chopper pilots and crews not only worked under extremely dangerous conditions for extended periods, but also worked exhausting schedules.  The accounts of everyday life for him are a revelation to others who served in different capacities.  Infantry soldiers naturally consider their personal battle experiences as the most graphic and dangerous, but after reading an account such as \\"Chickenhawk\\" we have to admit that while our life on the ground was not enviable, life in the air was no better, and often times much worse.  I served a couple years later on the ground with the 1st Cavalry. We considered the choppers as our \\"lifeline\\" then, and we appreciate them even more today, attributing our survival in large part to their efforts and sacrifices.<br /><br />As with many who experienced the Vietnam War personally, Mason unfortunately brought the war home with him in the form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  His experience was the basis for the highly acclaimed book \\"Recovering from the War\\" by his wife Patience H. C. Mason.<br /><br />My review cannot fully communicate the value of this exceptionally well written work.  I recommend it highly to all those who served, but also to anyone touched personally by the Vietnam War, whether it be family, friend or others simply interested.  And finally, I salute you Mr. Mason for your service and dedication; it has not been forgotten.<br /><br />David B.

B007ZH6WJY|4.0|This book is about author's experiences through his initiatives under IDE. Those who work for international development and cooperation field may get some kind of inspiration to make projects and programs better and more effective. Besides it reminds you the importance of knowing the reality of the people, those who are poor. This is what I also found when I started my research work at master course on rural development. Though it may not so relevant for those organizations which implements mega projects and huge financing, but as development professionals I think we have to know different aspects of realities that are introduced here in this book.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I totally love this game. I am not even very good at drawing, but it is fun anyway. Love it
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just got it on my Kindle Fire. Use it on my PC  daily & am addicted !<br />Will use it more when traveling.
B00280LYHS|5.0|So amazing love it and it's a great ending ! Dec would recommend it to anyone that loves books like mwah!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A love a book that doesn't end happily ever after, where the nightmares still return, where there is no certainty or even real hope, loose ends everywhere and yet, the end. Adore this series!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game gives you a chance to live in a world that you control and it has so many things you can do.

B004J4WNL2|4.0|If you're an extrovert, as I am, this book is definitely for you.  It brought me into the world of the introvert, and helped me develop an understanding of how introverts work best, and taught me how to create an environment where introverts can be happy and productive.<br /><br />In a classroom and at work, it is easy to overlook the introverts.  We might see them as loners.  They're not &#34;team players.&#34;  They don't participate in class. They may not make exciting, dynamic presentations at meetings.  They might go to a brainstorming meeting and not offer one new idea.  And at school and work, it can be hard to imagine that an introvert can be an effective leader.<br /><br />This book takes you into the world of the introvert.  You can understand what it feels like to be an introvert.  And most importantly, you can come to appreciate the tremendous contributions that introverts can make if we would only stop talking.<br /><br />Susan Cain makes her case by telling stories from the point of view of an introvert, and by summarizing important research.  She re-introduces us to famous leaders who are introverts and describes how their thinking style made them such effective leaders.  And she helps teachers understand the introverted student and create an environment in which they can flourish.<br /><br />I sometimes felt that the stories could have been shorter, and that the author could have made her points more succinctly.  I preferred skimming some of the stories and moving on to the research summaries.  On the other hand, I am sure that there are many readers who would appreciate the stories much more than I did.<br /><br />Every minute I spent reading this book was time well spent.

B0000DG00B|5.0|I've had this album for some time now, but my memories of this awesome festival are far older. Having been to Woodstock the year before I was ready for another dose of summer fun. Little did I know that this festival would prove to be just as exciting musically as Woodstock had been,and in actuality I think it may have exceeded it. As a 20 year old Yankee from Long Island I wondered what the South had to offer. Well,it offered a weekend of rock that has stayed with me to this day. Arriving the day before the show was to begin we pitched a tent and sampled the Southern hospitality on hand(insert your imagination here). The rumor was that \\"some bands\\" were going to play in the woods nearby. Making my way through the darkness I came to a clearing at a dirt road. Sure enough there was a large flatbed truck loaded with a complete stage of musical equiptment. Who was going to play out here in the boonies? The Allman Brothers that's who!! They took to the makeshift stage and ripped into a complete set. If that wasn't enough Johnny Winter soon joined them and the game was on! There were probably no more than several hundred people there but the boys played like there was no tomorrow. Imagine Johnny and Duane trading licks on \\"Highway 61\\" and you'll get the idea. Totally mind blowing. Anyway, there was a \\"tomorrow\\" and it was captured on this album in all its glory. The Allmans opened the festival and then closed it. You can read elsewhere about all the great music that came in between, including Hendrix, but this album stands the test of time as a document to a truly amazing performance by a band in its prime hammering on all eight cylinders. I wonder if the Brothers had a tape rolling when they played that show before the show back in the woods. hmmmm....
0385349947|5.0|I read this book over a few hours- it was compelling and extremely relevent to me even though I am not in business.  As a mother and professional I have struggled with almost every point the author makes.  I hope my daughter finds her situation more seamless when she is older.  I also read some of the negative reviews and most of them seem to revolve around:<br /><br />1. Some argue this book is not relevant to the mass majority of women in this economy; the author was born into privilege and rode on luck to get to where she is; she doesn't have to worry about the real consequences of \\"leaning in\\" in the workplace... PLEASE...I think Sandberg aknowledges she has many benefits afforded her, but it doesn't really negate her points and the fact that people sought her for her jobs- I would think for adequate enough reason (capability!).  She also doesn't promote antagonizing in the workplace but encourages individuals to affect change.  I found the most interesting diatribes against the author for not understanding real women to be from the male reviewers.<br /><br />2. Why is she called a \\"b**tch\\" by some reviewers?  Kind of confirms her double standard points.  How personally do they know her?<br /><br />3.  I never found the book to be about male bashing.  She indicated support that she got from her male contemporaries (which I never read to be \\"dependence\\") and only illustrated specific situations that ACTUALLY happened due to men's sexism.  She does not bash men.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book and will recommend it.  It has come at a important time in my personal career where I feel torn between my family and work.  It's not a percentage game (what percent of you is devoted to what and whether that's the best way). What I got from this read is perspective and encouragement and validation.
0817439390|5.0|This book was VERY educational and has improved my photography a 100%. Very practical advice and tips.  My only regret is I should have bought this book sooner!
B0078XMA6O|3.0|Just as the title says.  Thoroughly enjoy the music but nothing spectacular.  What bugged me most though is that I can usually start an album on my way to work and get there before the album is finished.  Not this one.  Cycled to repeat well before the end of my trip.  In that context it's a good album to mix up with other material.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I think this game is amazing! And, with the new sandbox mode, it is even better! The towers have 2 upgrade paths instead of one, and more difficulties and bloon varieties! It is DEFINITELY worth $2.99! I recommend. this app for anyone!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Really like this game. Only thing I don't like is my difficulty with using the tilt control, but I'm working on it. I would recommend this game to everyone
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been a lover of reading since fairy tales, but age and a bad back pretty much took this joy away from me.  Enter the kindle, thank you Amazon!!!<br />So while looking for books to add to my new toy I came across Wool, and was immediately surprised by the sheer number of good reviews.  So even tho free is out there, .99 books are out there, I took a chance and bought the wool omnibus.  WOw, its' been so so long since I've enjoyed reading a book this way! I could not put my finger on what is it about this book that makes it so gosh darn good.  But I was immediately drawn to the characters, the mystery of \\"what happenedA\\" and of course I love post apocalypse stories to boot. I'm now reading the next series, well actually the prequel  (think star wars 4,5,6 and THEN 1,2,3) and again I'll be darned if I can't put the dang thing down!  4 am here I am reading it!  So as I said, it's been so long since I've enjoyed a novel this much, thank you Mr Howey!!!!I wait for the next book anxiously, and I feel lucky as h*ll to have discoverd the treasure you are.<br />Marcia
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I love this movie no matter what other people say. All the guys in it look so hot, there is nothing more to ask for.

B00APD6O16|5.0|This is the best bond in a true Ian Flemming performance.This is the one to watch that ties the true history together.  Ever wonder why it's not in any of the collections?
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Well made and comes with sheath. Sheath will not allow knife to fall out no matter how it is carried. Handle is a little smooth but can fix that. Thinking may buy another with the 7 inch blade to be able to split larger wood and give this one to my son
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My 4 year old daughter and I both love this game. We play it everyday. It's very kid friendly and you're not blasted by ads. There are opportunities for in-app purchases but you can turn that off and still happily play the game.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|My prime subscription expired so my book was deleted.  Going to try to pay as I go for now.  Not sure yearly premium works for me.
B001H1OUUC|5.0|Ray Lamontagne sounds so much better on vinyl.  His digital product is horribly compressed (though this title not as much as the Robert Ludwig masterings); rest assured Till the Sun Turns Black on vinyl is the vastly superior sounding edition.  Lamontagne's voice and Ethan Johns' production both breathe.  The woodwinds and guitar are far more real & less harsh than on CD. It is mastered by Ray Janos (I imagine from Ted Jensen's original hi res). A little surface noise, but not obtrusive.  Flat 180g record.  No download code/card.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I just love it,how you have to think what you need to use, and the instructions are clear. Thank you Rovio best game ever!!
B001AX9DSQ|5.0|This is double 180g release in a gatefold.  Like all RL records, there is no digital download.  The sound is vastly superior to the heavily compressed CD.  I imagine it's a hi res mastering of the Robert Ludwig files.  It's done by Ray Janos who has done RL's stuff.  Far more organic & less aggressive than the digital versions.  This vinyl breathes nicely making the most of Ethan Johns production.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It just doesn't work. It won't update, it doesn't register my comments or likes, my messages won't open.i just bought my kindle fire and can't even go on Facebook. Please fix this!!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really enjoyed this little gem.  I liked the characters and the imagery.  I enjoyed the themes and the writing was fluid.  Never a dull moment for me.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|this is the worst of the worst...don't rent or purchase this junk as it is the bolting together of multiple movies and plots into one worthless movie (IMHO)
B00AO3K05S|4.0|The book is divided into 3 parts - the first where he tries to convince us that all of us are in sales. I wasn't too convinced with this argument. However in the 2nd and the 3rd parts of the book he introduces us to the new ABC - attunement, bouyancy and clarity.The good part was that he gives us many of the recent studies on techniques and has several exercises after each chapter.<br /><br />What you get is by practicing and being in sales I have used some of the techniques recently to good effect. But it remains to be seen how effective they would be 6 months down the line.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is awesome I love it it is sweet and go buy it and play it as much as you can
B000FC2KL0|4.0|This book is very well written, I don't know if Keidis did it by himself but he does a very interesting compilation from his childhood until 2001 (post Californication). It sounds pretty honest and humble, funny at moments, sad most of it, but it changed my mind about what I thought about him. you can't help but thinking that this guy has suffered all his life on drug addiction, it's a terrible lesson that shows that bad can be worse.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphic is awesome. I cannot stop myself to play it again and again. And it is fluent on my device.
B0045XICB2|4.0|A REALLY GOOD ONE BLUE RAY IS BETTER, SHE IS SUCH A TALENTED ACTRESS..THE PAIR EDWARD AND BELLA, ARE REALLY FUN TO WATCH TOGETHER..HOPE THEY DO MORE MOVIES
B001GST11O|5.0|Nothing I can write about this that hasn't already been said. But since I agreed to review this item and have more words I have to write . . .
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|All I can really say is wow.  Great graphics and visuals.I highly recommend this game. I know my kids will love it.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I decided to buy this digital version of the movie instead of the Blu-Ray as I know the extended edition is set to come out this winter when the second part comes out in theatres. This still includes some of the special features that came with the Blu-Ray and I can watch it at any time, it was also less expensive than the Blu-Ray was at the store so I am happy with this purchase.
B0015RB72W|1.0|Back in '08 I purchased this on CD and thought that the recording was saturated by recording with the levels too high.  I recently purchased this on vinyl from here.  I was very excited to play it once I received it, but not so much after I listened to it.  What I wasn't prepared for was that the analog version was actually worse than the CD.  Thankfully, I didn't spend a boatload of money on it and at the time, it was cheaper then it is now.
B007V4530A|2.0|I am a great fan of TED but this book have not given me added insight. Perhaps because all TED lectures are so different.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I have a few Sheldons's in my family.  This show just makes it funny instead of infuriating. Can't wait for more!
B00335EQ0E|1.0|I can't believe this is a children's movie. It must have been a joke. I thought it was a cute movie at first.  The little girl seemed so real and life-like.<br />(I am going to give my review based on how a child would view this movie.) Due to her curiosity, Alice fell into a rabbit's hole, which seemed like a 150 story building as she floated to the bottom.  She drank a mysterious drink (from a stranger) or a potion that by today's standards could have been poison. She talked to and followed a stranger or a large bunny rabbit (i think?) Then she put something or a cookie in her mouth and ate it to become large again.  She cried huge tears due to home sick and flooded the whole room and her self.  Next she drank from the potion bottle again and became tiny to get in a tiny bottle and float safely or survive the flood.<br />I found the movie traumatic and scary as I witnessed from the point of view of a small child.  A little girl was in danger and no one was around to help.  This movie would need adult supervision if little children watched.  So many truths would have to be taught such as stranger danger, dont talk to strangers, dont eat or drink things that a stranger gives you, it could be drugs or poison, dont run away from home or leave the home without a parent, you could get hurt and everyone is not nice. It would also be overwhelming for small children to watch a Alice cry the enormous tears she cried.  She was in so much distress and no adult was around to soothe, calm or listen to her. Lastly, this movie is for adult supervision only.  One must not assume a child will not take it seriously.  If Alice, a child was afraid, little children watching her will be also.<br />I gave this movie one star because it is marketed for children and it crosses so many limits that are unacceptable for children to watch.  And it sends too many wrong messages that are not good for the safety of children. I do not find it entertaining to see a child in distress or doing thingsthat can bring her harm. We have enough of that in real life.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Held my interest throughout all three books and I'm a sci-fi fan!<br />I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a lot of action.
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|its an okay game but I think they could have made it just a tiny bit better! tht is wht I think

B009GQ57ES|5.0|It's so nice to hear some thought-provoking rap these days that's not just about drugs, money, and cars.  Best artist since Tupac!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I'm not really into Marvel so I was really surprised that I really did enjoy this movie. Though, I was a tinsy bit confused about what was going on, then I watched Thor, maybe this was just me, but after watching Thor the Avengers made a lot more sense to me. The story really didn't get intresting till Thor came, and no it's not because Chris plays him, but after watching Thor he grew on me. Anyways, this movie really is a great movie and I'm a girl so.., if you don't like this movie then something is wrong with you and you don't know what a great, action packed movie is.<br /><br />Spoilers<br />S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives at one of his agency's facilities during an evacuation. The Tesseract, an energy source of unknown potential, has activated. It opens a portal through space and the exiled Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steps through. Loki takes the Tesseract and also takes control of the minds of several SHIELD personnel, including Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and Agent Clint \\"Hawkeye\\" Barton (Jeremy Renner), to aid him in his getaway. As SHIELD personnel pull out of their base, some pursuing Loki and others merely fleeing, the ground beneath the base collapses and it's destroyed. In response to the attack, Fury re-activates the Avengers Initiative. First he pulls Agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), a.k.a. the Black Widow, out of an interrogation (tied to a chair, she seems to be the victim rather than the interrogator, but appearances are deceiving). Fury sends her to India to find and recruit Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), a.k.a. the Hulk. At the same time Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) approaches \\"Iron Man\\" Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and requests that he review Dr. Selvig's research. Fury himself approaches Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a.k.a. Captain America, with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract from Loki. During his exile, Loki encountered the Chitauri, an alien race seeking to conquer the galaxy. In exchange for the Tesseract, the Chitauri agree to help Loki subjugate Earth. Suiting up, Captain America and Iron Man travel to Germany to apprehend Loki, who is recovering iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power, and demanding that the civilians kneel before him. Loki quickly surrenders when the two heroes arrive, and he is escorted to a SHIELD helicarrier, a high-tech, flying aircraft carrier. However, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Loki's half-brother and the Norse God of thunder, arrives and attempts to free Loki so he can reason with him on his own, but he gets into a fight with Iron Man and Captain America. The fight ends in a stalemate. Eventually, Loki is taken to the helicarrier and placed in a glass cell designed to hold the Hulk. Fury explains that if Loki attempts to escape, even by merely cracking the glass, a shaft will open below him and he'll plummet to Earth and possibly be killed. The Avengers, now brought together, argue and deliberate over how to approach Loki and the revelation that SHIELD plans to harness the Tesseract's power to develop weapons, a discovery made by Rogers. Fury admits that the events in New Mexico a year before (recounted in \\"Thor\\") made SHIELD aware of other races on other worlds, some of whom may see Earth as an easy target. The decision was made to produce weapons with the Tesseract as a means of deterrence. As the group argues, Clint Barton and Loki's possessed agents attack the helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight. While Stark and Rogers attempt to restart the damaged engine, Romanoff tries to prevent Dr. Banner from turning into the Hulk and destroying the ship from inside. Her attempt fails and she's chased through the ship until Thor takes up the battle to pacify the beast and manages to fell him briefly with a hit from his hammer, Mjolnir. While fighting Barton, Romanoff slams him into a guard rail, and the blow to the head breaks Loki's mind control. After the Hulk falls from the ship, Thor is tricked into Loki's holding cell by Loki himself, who has recovered his scepter and releases the cell and allows Thor to plummet. Loki is held at bay briefly by Agent Coulson who is also tricked by one of Loki's holographic projections - Coulson is stabbed in the back by the real Loki. Coulson later shoots Loki with a blast from an unidentified weapon, one that harnesses the power of the Destroyer. Coulson dies while Fury tries to save his life. Thor escapes from the cell a split second before it hits the ground. Banner wakes up in his human form after crashing into an abandoned factory. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers to work as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that simply defeating them will not be enough for Loki. He needs to overpower them in a very public way so as to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Using a device built by Dr. Selvig, Loki opens a portal to the Chitauri home world over Manhattan, summoning a Chitauri invasion. The Avengers rally in defense of New York, but quickly come to the conclusion that they will be overwhelmed as wave after wave of Chitauri descend upon Earth. With help from the reformed Barton, Captain America and Thor evacuate civilians while Dr. Banner transforms into the Hulk and goes after Loki, beating him into submission in Tony Stark's penthouse. Romanoff makes her way, with a little help from the Chitauri, to the device that holds the portal open (conveniently located on the roof of the Stark Building) and hits Dr. Selvig over the head, freeing him of Loki's control. Dr. Selvig reveals that Loki's staff can be used to close the portal. Meanwhile, the council overrides Fury and scrambles a jet that fires a nuclear missile at Manhattan to end the invasion. Iron Man intercepts the missile and directs it at the portal and the Chitauri base before running out of oxygen and plummeting back to Earth, but the Hulk catches him as he falls. A dazed Stark, awakened by the Hulk's roar, offers to take the team out for shawarma, but they decide to apprehend Loki first. Thor escorts Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard, while Fury notes that the Avengers will go their separate ways until a new world-threatening menace emerges. In a mid-credits scene, the Chitauri leader the Other tells his master that it is futile to attack Earth, as fighting the Avengers is like courting death. His master turns, revealing himself to be Thanos. After further credits, the Avengers are shown eating together in a shawarma joint; the team looks worn out and no one speaks.s tricked into Loki's holding cell by Loki himself, who has recovered his scepter and releases the cell and allows Thor to plummet.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I canl relate to this movie like as if I were born back in the 80's. I love video games all I had as a child were video games. My father wasn't around in my life until I was 14 years old since he is a marine. so all I have had is video games to build upon and understand what makes it good. So just to get this out of the way. I absolutely LOVE my n64 and the games on it. But I would have to say that it started with Mario and then Goldeneye/Turok, Perfect dark, Doom/Duke Nukem. And many many more that I still play to this day and have experienced in their original format back in the DOS gaming days and so on. I have been to arcades I have played them all. I have a atari 5200, I believe that is what it is called. but any who this movie is amazing the relation and creativity and RIGHTS they had to go through for the movie I can imagine as hectic. But with it they made a excellent movie. A very risky movie that turned out to be a fabulous one. This movie for me is like Grandmas Boy is to me or Joe Dirt among many others. It's a Movie you wished never ended and just kept going. That's the sad part but the good part is that you get to watch it for as long as you live. Even though I am only 18 now I consider myself pretty retro. So retro that I still prefer a CRT Tube TV over an LCD/LED due to it's quality picture and how they age really well. This movie to me is like what toy story was to me back when I was 4. It's a great movie! And if you understand the story behind it and the purpose then even though you may or may not be a 'gamer' you can at least understand that it has a purpose and a meaning rather than just being more awesome by having all those game characters you grew up with. To bad DoomGuy or Duke Nukem weren't in it :D. Wreck it Ralph is like a cross over of a Donkey Kong game and a Rampage game. TurboTime is like an ExciteBike game vs TopGear when he got jealous. Sugar Rush is obviously like a Mario kart. and Hero's Duty is your classic but very awesome First Person Shooter but reminds me of Armorines n64 and Doom at the end of the movie :). I love this movie and I could go on and on about it for forever. But I can't because that be more than the bible itself to read. Just watch it... Oh and I saw another review about how it's \\"predictable\\" well it's a movie, not a TV show and with that basically any movie cartoon/action/horror are predictable, you know how? They end simple as that. That is pretty much the simplest way to put it there without confusing any other critics. It's a great movie simple as that, watch it and you wont be disappointed.Person Shooter but reminds me of Armorines n64 and Doom at the end of the movie :).

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a science fiction guy. I've been reading it since Asimov, Heinlein, and Bradbury ruled the roost. &#34;Wool&#34; is as good as anything these guys have written and any contemporary science fiction writer has written. It has action, suspense romance and a chilling message which is relevant today. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good story, not just science fiction geeks. Good work Mr Howey.

B003L77FYS|5.0|I love this show and the chemistry with Castle and Becket. Hats off to the writers. hope this show makes a long run very entertaining!
B003HYNB34|5.0|Looks-wise, Matt Smith is not a typical Hollywood one-dimensional, little or no personality pretty boy hero choice. Thank goodness BBCAmerica isn't so limited in their choices!!!! I and other longtime and new Dr. Who fans would be missing the fabulous gift of Matt Smith's 11th Dr. Who's delightful, bubbling over personality! What a loss that would be!<br /><br />Via Matt Smith's portrayal, the 11th Doctor is playful, enthusiastic, full of passion for life, his friends, new discoveries and just brightly and boldly lights up the screen! He's also very ferocious and protective when the role calls for those qualities and tender and gentle at other times. It's awesome and uplifting and continues to get better!<br />There are the episodes that are dark and foreboding and he's depressed and sullen due to certain tragic outcomes, these are clearly communicated in Matt Smith's wonderful performance.<br /><br />With Stephen Moffat at the helm, the storytelling of Dr. Who's adventures is going in unique and very entertaining directions! The writing overall is deep, imaginative and has great theme and character patterns follow-through from episode to episode and season to season. The time travel stories are very well done and have at times entertainingly made my brain crossed in trying to figure them out.<br /><br />I hope Matt Smith and Stephen Moffat continue on successfully for many years! It's a show I always look forward to watching and overall doesn't disappoint.

In my opinion, the story is great, but I believe it could well be a full size novel. And I would want it to be:) I was not ready for the story to end so soon, and would have loved to read more.<br /><br />I will definitely devour a sequel!
0060555661|4.0|Arrived promptly.  Just scanned it so far, looks very good.  Read forwards and found them interesting.  Hoping to learn a lot from the book.

B005HE5J7I|5.0|While very long, Edward Rutherford's London was a page-turner for me.  I had loved Sarum, his book about Salisbury Cathedral from about 30 years ago ( a forerunner to Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth and equally as good), so was delighted that London was as well-written.  The characters at times are confusing, as there are many and it is hard to flip black to the geneology chart in the front of the Kindle version (maybe a hard copy would be better in that regard; but the Kindle version would definitely be lighter to hold!), but generally, it was very fascinating to read.  The book follows generations of Londoners from back in the days when it was just a ford in the River Thames to modern day London.  Having been to London, I could identify with a lot of the places, which made it even more entertaining to read, but that is not a prerequisite to enjoying the novel, as it is the well-rounded characters who drive the story.  It will take a while to read it, but because it covers generations, each section is almost like a book of its own and follows fascinating story lines.  I highly recommend it to people who like historical fiction.

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I ordered this movie to show to my English as an Additional Language students, as it not only is a very fun movie to see, but it also teaches a bit about American culture and a lot about how we can daily improve ourselves.  The message is a good one.  While Groundhog Day was filmed some time ago, it is somewhat ageless in some regards, and I would recommend it to anybody.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Though written for teenagers, I feel that this book bridges to all age groups.  It is well written, has real dialogue and descriptions, and has life-and-death themes that appeal to overcome.  I enjoyed it and know it is one I will reread.  I'm happy I bought it - I will get my money out of it.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|DVDs, Blue-Rays with quite a few extras and a Digital Copy of my favorite HBO Series...and it was on sale. What else could I ask for???

0452289963|5.0|This is a very good but intense book. Takes a little longer to read than most but is very encouraging and interesting. Teaches us the true meaning of our purpose and finding our inner happiness in our lives.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Those of us today could never know of the lives of President Lincoln and his push for ammendment 13, his anguish to declare by constitutional law that cost him his life so parallels the assassinated president of our century, Kennedy. a story for anyone to see.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Now I can see why Daniel Day-Lewis won the academy award for his performance.  Very well done and so realistic.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|I am not an Ashton fan but this movie was ok. It is definitely a rainy day type of movie. Some parts are funny. All in all I would recommend it if you like quirky hick flicks.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I'm a big fan of director Wes Anderson, but hated his last live-action effort the Darjeeling Limited.  His films have always been offbeat and quirky, but I was afraid he was becoming a caricature of himself.<br /><br />Thankfully, he returns to top form with Moonrise Kingdom.  This is one of his best.  The film, of course, has usual Andersonian quirkiness, but the story is solid and provides laughs and touching dramatic moments.  Unlike Darjeeling, this film has a stronger plot and doesn't get lost in its own style.  The quirks and details enhance the story, instead of being the main attraction.<br /><br />The cast is also star-studded and each actor, both stars and unknowns, deliver phenomenal performances.  Check this one out!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This story shows no matter how you fight it true love always wins. Follow this young couple through a whirl wind of a year to have a truly happily ever after.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|This is a very unique, original, and compelling movie.  That said, it's not a movie for the masses.<br /><br />If you enjoy unconventional, artistic movies, then you will likely enjoy The Master.  If you're a PT Anderson fan, you'll probably like it as well.<br /><br />If you enjoy more standard, conventional big budget films, I would steer clear.  If you're chomping at the bit for the next Die Hard and Mission Impossible sequel, stay away!<br /><br />This is a very good film, but it's very dependent on taste.  The casual moviegoer who wants a easy, fluff movie will absolutely hate this.  However, if you like to explore unique and unusual films, check this out!
B0087GJ8KM|2.0|Not sure what went wrong here.  But I've started and can't even bring myself to finish. The book just lacks something. I think I can't figure out whose the audience. I'm a sales person so I thought it was for sales people but instead it spent countless chapters convincing me that everyone's a sales person. If you're reading the book you're already interested so don't belabor the point.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game but its addictive I try to play every day to get the most out of it
B009F7OQ5Y|5.0|I think this doll is one of the prettiest in the Birthday Wishes series. The Silver Label dolls (with the exception of #G 8059 & 8061) in this series have a sexy, sophisticated, old Hollywood look and this doll in more in line with the other dolls - having the princess style gown and simple but pretty hair style. Bought one directly from Mattel and another from Amazon which was nicely discounted. I also saw them at Target and they were priced more in line with Mattel.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I was drawn in from the first paragraph. Jack was a great story teller. Reading the story through the eyes and understanding of a 5 year old was very interesting.
B004AKCME8|5.0|So touching! Animation was great. It's amazing what directors can do with films. Love Owls they one of my fav animals!

0792839749|5.0|It's been a long time since I saw this movie. There was part I didn't remember. A lot I remember. It's a good movie for children and adults
B004ADH1RI|2.0|Completely inappropriate for 10 year old girls, even though the rating and age qualifications said it was okay.  In the first 10 minutes, swear words and the Statue of David's privates falling off and then a five minute focus on putting his &#34;package&#34; back in tact.  We cut it off before suffering through an hour and a half of tired, boring humor.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Gerard Butler is a great actor. True story movie is my fav. This was a touching movie of someone's dream.<br />He was a great surfer. He died doing what he loved. That's the way I wanna go!
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|This movie was visually interesting, and the way they went from scene to scene much like a play was fun to watch, but as for the storyline and keira knightley's character, I just was not feeling this movie.  I won't ever watch it again!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Musicals are great. Love the songs in this movie. Don't make movies like this anymore. Music keeps me pumped up
B004DNWPY4|5.0|This helps to illustrate the re-emergence of the idea that millionaires don't always live high on the hog. For those of us interested in becoming free of financial worries, it's a great motivator to stay on the path and a great tutorial aid on how to do it.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|I didn't like it at all.it was very hard for me to keep reading it ! It just didn't have it ,the other books were great ! This book fell short of my expectations! To bad for the money I spent was not worth it at all!
B001U3Y5XE|2.0|It's a lot harder than you'd think.  There are some unique pieces, but you have to have a REALLY good imagination to create AND guess what the other person built.  I consider myself pretty creative, but I really don't like this game.  My 10 year old who loves legos doesn't seem too impressed with it either.  There just aren't enough pieces I guess???????
B004SBX112|5.0|angry birds seasons is a perfect game if you are bored out of your mind! it gets frustrating but is so enjoyable.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'm a late bloomer to the whole Firefly/Serenity franchise but when I discovered it, I loved it. The movie is great for those people who have seen the Firefly series and want more, but it also could be a standalone movie. The characters are realistic in this futuristic world, and yet likeable. There are times when I laugh one moment and then gasp in horror in the next. A roller coaster ride of a movie. Just wish there had been more from these characters.

B004SKJTY6|1.0|Other reviewers have also noted the deception regarding this film - currently it is 1.99 for amazon prime members to watch.  It _appeared_ the movie was an Amazon Prime free film.  Shame on Amazon for this deception.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|If you like the tv series you will like the book. It's kind of fun being able to picture Nathon and Stana as you read. It is not Pulitzer writing but is entertaining. So it serves it's purpose.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Very useful app. Exactly what I was looking for in an alarm clock. Just enough options so as not to be boring, but simple enough to be useful.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Good storyline.  Good character development.  Great plot....keeps you guessing and gives nothing away. I really enjoyed this book.  Good buy.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|This is a rather lame knock off of the original super Mario brothers.  I'm sure there can be only so much similarity before you get in the world of lawsuits, but it lacks clever trade offs.  It's like a watered down version of Super Mario Brothers. I gave it two stars instead of one because it actually works and in a moment if desperate boredom, you might mildly entertain yourself.  Wouldn't be my first choice of game apps though.
B002VHI8J0|4.0|I was surprised at how attached I became to each of the narratives that make up the book Cloud Atlas, and how involved I became with the central characters in each one; surprised because the device used by the author - stringing stories that initially seem unconnected and unfinished together in an unkown sequence - was a risky one in terms of how it might affect the reader's ability to engage fully with each story. Instead, I was drawn in and felt empathy with the characters in all their incarnations. I liked the subtlety with which the various connections between the stories were gradually revealed. I think that as it entertains - and it's a definite page-turner - Cloud Atlas illustrates the idea that time is not a straight line, progress is not marching forever forward from a fixed point, and the individuality and interconnectedness of people with one another is paramount. Instead of depressing the reader with the thought that history is doomed to repeat itself over and over, it focuses on the importance of individual lives and actions.

B0027MJU00|4.0|Tough to put down.  Keeps you wanting to read just one more chapter.  The ending was alittle hard to beieve, but, it didn't keep me from enjoying the book!
0451232852|5.0|I had just finished three well documented history books covering the period from 1890 to 1919. Fall of Giants proved to be a good choice as a follow-up to these works. The poverty of the working classes in England, The hopelessness of life in Tsarist Russia, the promise and disillusionment of America, are all portrayed with candor and sensitivity in this novel. This sad era had so much potential, but all that was wasted in devastating war. I was particularly struck by the accurate depiction of aristocratic attitudes in England and Russia. Folletts characters are compelling and endearing. The historical backdrop is well researched. Marvelous Book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like this game. its fun and interesting, plus its a great way to pass the time. I have no problems with this game.
0525952926|5.0|Being a historian, I was pleased that although this book is centered on fictional characters the historical backdrop is rendered accurately (here I speak of events, not necessarily the interpretation of events). I especially liked the author's description of how the Nazis came to power in  Germany. It is sometimes hard to understand how sane people could allow an extremist madman to gain the power to dominate their lives. The author does this in marvelous fashion! The characters in this novel are well developed. I look forward to the third book in this series.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|started reading and just deleted it. I don't enjoy being told how many words I need to use in a review.
0425263916|5.0|This is a great book/series! I cant wait till the 3rd book comes out because it has left me hanging!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is the second time I read this book.<br /> You can't help falling for these two. They are so much alike and different.<br />Abby is running from her past and Travis just happens to be right there center stage for her to meet.<br />They have so many struggles between them. They even make it difficult for each other to get along. Everybody around them know they belong together but they are both stubborn in their own way that it takes them through break ups, fights, attacks<br />and a fire before they reallize it. I can't wait for Walking Disaster<br />to be released so I can find out what they have been up and what bets will be happening between them.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't hate it. But I definitely didn't love it. Had to read it for book club. I wouldn't recommend it.

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|It is clear to see why this movie was ranked highly on Amazon.  I enjoyed it very much and have recommended it to others.

B0090SI4LU|2.0|\\"An unseen enemy who can erase your memory.\\" I HATE it when that happens! Also known as \\"La huésped,\\" this story is based on the novel by Stephanie Meyer (\\"Twilight\\") so this PG-13 film should be a crowd pleaser. My problem was with the 3M dialogue: Murmur; Mutter; and Mumble (I missed 50% of what they said). The screenplay, by Andrew Niccol (\\"In Time\\") who also directed, confused me: I honestly couldn't tell when it was intentionally humorous or just plain laughable. I WILL say our screening audience laughed many, many times.<br /><br />We start with a young woman so desperate to save her younger brother's life from \\"peaceful\\" alien invaders she makes a suicidal leap out a window but is soon restored to life by those same despicable beings. From then on, she has the icy blue eyes which tell us that she too, is one of \\"them.\\" Problem is, the survivalist human she replaced has survived...as a pesky voice inside her head. Thus the humor.<br /><br />I appreciate that all the men in the survivalist community are twenty-ish hunks, each with one good reason or another to be attracted to our heroine. Hey...It's Stephanie Meyer!<br /><br />Here we have:<br />  * Saoirse Ronan (\\"Atonement\\") is Melanie/Wanda, both with distinct personalities, vying for control. As Melanie she was in love with Jared, but that doesn't stop Wanda from falling for Ian. Got that straight?<br />  * Max Irons (\\"Red Riding Hood\\") Yeah! ...Okay, so Jared is another survivalist; he lived with our heroine and her younger brother in a derelict mobile home before the aliens started imposing their peaceful ways on the planet.<br />  * Jake Abel (\\"I Am Number Four\\") is Ian, who falls for the alien Wanda with poor Melanie shouting her dismay from inside Wanda's head.<br />  * Chandler Canterbury (\\"Repo Men\\") is indispensable as little brother Jamie who is the first to sort out where the spirit of his missing sister might be lurking.<br />  * Diane Kruger (\\"Inglorious Basterds\\") is relentless as The Seeker.She WILL capture that missing girl even if she has to resort to violence to do it! (...gasp...)<br />  * William Hurt (\\"Robin Hood\\" 2010) as Jeb, is the paterfamilias of a group of survivalist wheat farmers. Their field is hidden inside a mountain...trust me. He keeps the peace with a loaded shotgun.<br />  * Marcus Lyle Brown (Lots of TV) His Healer Fords is the medical man who lives with the survivalists and tries to help our heroine.<br /><br />At least the aliens are easy to spot: their various means of travel (a Ford Lotus, some motorcycles and a few helicopters) are all bright silver. Expect some gunfire, a little vehicular mayhem, no profanity, no sweaty bodies and no blowie uppie stuff. In addition, this movie passes the Bechdel Test because the women talk about the issues at hand, not about a man.<br /><br />The message is: \\"Love conquers all,\\" so look for a happy ending AND a theater with closed captions! (Or wait for the DVD from Amazon.)
B009PNQUXO|2.0|I thought it was YouTube... I didn't really mess with it to much to figure out what it really does?  I don't upload anything to YouTube, just watch what other people put on there.  So it wasn't helpful to me.
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|The cast is excellent; however, the script has far too much gratuitous bloodshed.  Also, as the plot develops, the psychopath orchestrating the cult murder spree is able to attract far more followers than is plausible.

B004J4WNL2|4.0|In Quiet... self-professed introvert Susan Cain explores the American cultural veneration of the extrovert ideal and how extrovert-worship may be hurting American individuals, education, business and society at large. Cain delves deep into biological and psychological explanations for introverted personality characteristics (which she defines extremely broadly as \\"the man of contemplation\\"), cataloging myriad ways that introversion is linked to superior analysis, innovation and relationships. As pragmatic as she is passionate, Cain's goal is to make the world better by rebalancing power between extroverts and introverts.  Quiet... delivers specific suggestions about how to cultivate equilibrium and compelling arguments about why we must.<br /><br />In the first section of Quiet Cain discusses how the industrialization of America and the rise of the marketing industry shifted American culture from one that valued character to a culture that worships personality. In a culture of character, admired people display cultivatable qualities like citizenship, manners and honor. In a culture of personality, society values characteristics like charm, magnetism and attractiveness. While these characteristics are associated with extroverts, they have no relationship to better relationships, greater intelligence, higher quality decision-making or job performance. According to Cain, this cultural trend has accelerated leaving up to half the population feeling exhausted, marginalized and discriminated against as team work, open office plans, presentations, hype and schmooze become ubiquitous in both schools and businesses. Moreover, ample research has demonstrated that solitude and concentration beget innovation and the best ideas--so to ignore the needs of introverts is to, in fact, truncate human potential.<br /><br />Cain goes on to explore various biological explanations for introversion and extroversion. She describes several studies suggesting deep biological differences in sensitivity to stimulus as well as one suggesting extroverts process dopamine differently than introverts, making them more prone to finding pleasure through the thrill of risk-taking. Cain briefly explores the cultural relativity of the Extrovert Ideal, contrasting American culture with certain East Asian cultures, concluding that introversion is valued more in certain cultures.<br /><br />On a personal level, I found the book to be quite interesting. It was impeccably researched, entertaining and lovingly written, though I was often distracted by Cain's deliberately broad use of the word \\"introvert.\\" I have used the Myers-Briggs personality framework (which defines introversion more narrowly) extensively, and have found it to be invaluable in guiding my management decisions and interpersonal relationships. Perhaps my discomfort was driven by the effort of fitting myself into the framework, but at times I felt Cain stretched the term so that it would appropriate positive characteristics that I would not necessarily ascribe to introverts alone.<br /><br />The \\"catch all\\" definition that she admits to using made me feel at times as if Cain was mixing cultural orientation dimensions, desirable character traits and personality preferences, which I believe to be separate, if interdependent, dimensions. For example, Cain demonstrates that many East Asian societies do not share the American cultural veneration of the extrovert. She hypothesizes that appreciation of introversion is correlated with a greater cultural valuing of social cohesion, or a collectivist cultural orientation. However, in my 13+ years of living in sub-saharan African countries, I have found that extroversion and expressiveness can greatly support a collectivist cultural orientation and promote social harmony. Moreover, I know many extrovert who are truly caring, thoughtful and deeply loving individuals, qualities that Cain seems to assign to Team Introvert.<br /><br />However, in spite of these minorissues (which were more points of reflection than flaws for me) the book gives voice to a giant portion of the population that is increasingly \\"marginalized,\\" by a cultural value that is already becoming detrimental to society--would the financial crisis have been so bad had more introverts been in decision-making positions? According to Cain,  no, and her reasoning is hard to deny.<br /><br />I also appreciated her pragmatism. At heart Quiet is a travel guide through the intimate geography of the introvert's inner landscape. Cain is intent on helping introverts understand and accept themselves, as she guides all of us to increase our consciousness of introversion and extroversion and confront our extrovert bias head on. She wants us to be more sensitive to the introverts around us: after all, they are our co-workers, friends and lovers and children. Her tips are simple, but have the potential to be transformative:<br /><br />1. Regulate your level of stimulation to avoid becoming over- or under-whelmed,<br />2. Create private spaces for reflection, concentration and synthesis--everybody needs these things to innovate,<br />3. Recognize that the world requires a certain level of extroversion--use your passion to fuel periodic excursions into the behaviors of extroversion (and get training and coaching to make you more comfortable in those behaviors),<br />4. Reformulate team work to allow both independent and group interaction: throwing a team at every problem is likely to result in inferior groupthink,<br />5. Shape your environment to meet your unique needs (e.g., negotiate days of working from home, schedule alone time after extended periods of extroversion, configure social situations to allow for quiet one-on-one and boisterous group interactions, etc.)<br />6. Recognize that both introverts and extroverts long for connection and intimacy, but they often express these needs--and handle conflict--differently.<br />Finally, Susan Cain's overarching message is toboth know and embrace who you are, recognizing that both extroversion and introversion have formidable strengths and powers, and that they complete each other. In all, Cain makes a compelling case for equal respect and increased effort to accommodate both introverts and extroverts for the good of all.

1601251556|5.0|A blank map is worth so much. Plus it is near impossible to ruin by not cleaning or using the wrong markers like other maps. (simply retrace the lines with a proper dry erase marker and even permanent marker comes up). Finally if you fold the mat the wrong way a few times it lies perfectly flat.<br /><br />All in all I wish I still had mine, and I'll probably be buying one again if I ever get back to running D&D, or other grid heavy game, in person.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is great for all age groups. I highly recommend this to you. It is great for long car trips or just to pass the time. GET IT! If your thinking about if this will just take up space on your phone or tablet , it won't.

B00845PV16|1.0|This movie looks like it was contracted out to an Eastern Euro company for production, or at least has that feel to it.  The first movie was Okay, but needed work.  This sequel was probably made with $3.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I love this app on iPad but not on nexus 7, video issues, black screen no video only audio. Please fix this issue and I will update my review to 5 stars.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Sade's new blu-ray concert video is exceptionally crystal-clear, great to watch and highly recommended. Sade performs with style, grace, and elegance as always. Her voice is even more beautiful and clear than ever, and the band is tight. It is a great ensemble perfectly cast in a top-notch award-worthy audio-visual production. This is a fine example of a first-class professional production.

B000B5XOSO|3.0|the movie box look like it had been cut into with a knife.<br />movie not damaged but  will no longer be giving you business
0316227706|5.0|If you've seen Seth's photos online, then you'll love this book.  The photos are great, and there are multiples of each dog to enjoy.  There is even a section in the back that shows what each dog looks like under normal circumstances.  Great coffee table book and conversation piece.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|We love this series.  The quirks, the drama, the comedy.  Sheldon never fails to make me so very happy that my husband is normal.  I also imagine that Leonard is going to be an amazing father because face it, he's raising Sheldon!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I got this game for my husband because he used to play Space Invaders during his youth. Needless to say he loves this game.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Still loving the series.  I keep waiting and waiting and waiting for Raj to finally find someone, anyone, and I'm hoping this season won't disappoint.
B007C7UZIG|1.0|I gave steam a try because of a sale they had.  Simply put, it is not worth it.  Games call home through the Steam software on every startup to verify you bought it.  Useless updates to Steam itself are randomly installed when trying to play, and are more annoying than MS or antivirus nags depending on your security settings. It is a game for crying out loud, not a commercial accounting package. I have to reset my password periodically, I am unsure why since it is supposed to be automatic from this PC.  On PC shutdown I must wait for Steam to log off if I forget to stop it in task manager.<br />Before you purchase through Steam, realize you are betting that this company will still be there to verify your purchase in the future. Not that Steam is always cheaper, but I would pay more to not have the intrusive Steam software overlay.<br />Activation schemes from software makers are understandable, but Steam is a rental ripoff with prices in the purchase range.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Keeps my brain trained and working. Like hard dancing is good for weight control/loss, these games are &#34;funner&#34; than other programs
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie was really quite funny, however, the adult themes make it unsuitable for younger children.  My adult sons and I had a lot of laughs watching it.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|Because my 8 year-old reads all of them and u\\"d describe it as a story about life and all the obstacles of life
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I watched the movie with my grandson and so when we watch it now it brings back great memories and a toasty warm feeling.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I'm not very good with puzzles so this app is perfect. The pictures are beautiful and the puzzles are not time consuming.
B00APJLFEG|2.0|Three kids, ages 10 to 12 voted to give it 3 stars, but they kept getting bored and leaving it.
0312330537|5.0|One of the best books I have read. Great story, interesting characters you will be intrigued by, and end up loving many. At its core a story of love.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love the temple run games. but the reason why I give it a three star is because when I open it, it loads for a few then crashes and takes me back to my kindle carosel. please fix soon!!!
B0092MKFIY|3.0|Radioactive was the only song I really liked....And it was very muffled or had to much base in it. And you can't adjust an mp3!!!
0449011909|5.0|they most intriguing story ive ever read. very raw and imaginative . Truly a must read to fully understand the Show!
0470913029|3.0|I do read this from time to time, though I find the diet hard to stick to. It is great though if you are gluten free. I was on a gluten free diet, but it is not only challanging at best, but it costs more too.<br />Have to admit it did help at first, but then I noticed it was not working as well as it had.<br />Still it is worth trying.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|best alarm application on the market. absolutely love it! so convenient how it does so much more than just an alarm.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read everything that Nelson Demille has published.  Got hooked on Charm School.  Just finished &#34;The Panther&#34; last night.  Keep the novels coming!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very suspenseful and interesting story plot that really picks up at the halfway point. However, I didn't like the ending because it didn't make sense.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|An excellent read. Well written, good storyline, characters you can relate to and understand. I'm now officially a Picoult fan.
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|I love the movie and appreciated that the shipping was quick but the disc skipped and froze in MANY places. I had to fast forward a lot to get it moving again.
0061478784|5.0|Perhaps the most well-known of Diana Wynne Jones's extensive body of work (and not just because of the [[ASIN:B00BEYYEIK Hayao Miyazaki film]]) \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is colourful, imaginative, humorous, mysterious and immensely clever, where nothing - absolutely nothing - is what it seems.  Chocka block full of vivid characters and a twisty-turny storyline, this is one of those rare books (usually reserved for adult novels) that I can read for the third, fourth, fifth time and still pick up on some new detail that I'd previously missed.<br /><br />In a sendup of the usual fairytale formula, Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three daughters, and so well aware that she's destined to have no adventures whatsoever in her life - especially with two younger, prettier sisters. Still, she's resigned to working in her late father's hat shop until the day the notorious Witch of the Waste enters and turns her into an old woman. Sophie has no idea why it's been done or how to break the spell, but ashamed of her new appearance, she takes to the road.<br /><br />She finds herself in the titular Moving Castle, home to the Wizard Howl who is rumored to seduce young girls and steal their hearts. Ironically, her transformation gives Sophie a new lease on life, finding that as an old woman she's lost most of her shyness and so assertive enough to set herself up as Howl's cleaning lady. In her new position Sophie finds an abundance of mysteries to contend with: a demon living in the fireplace that offers to remove her spell if she helps break his contract with the wizard, the logistics of the castle itself, which has a singular door that can open into various locations and worlds (including modern-day Wales) and Howl himself, an infuriatingly vain and self-absorbed wizard with astonishing power that he apparently uses solely to woo ladies.<br /><br />The story itself is intricately plotted, with Sophie being witness to several events that don't have their full meaning explained until much later. The identities of several characters remain concealed, or even divided up between various entities for much of the book's duration, and the motivations of the book's main players can be mysterious or even obscure. It's a tangled web that takes some discernment (or perhaps a second read) to fully grasp, especially given the rather hurried wrap-up, but it makes for a surprisingly complex storyline that demands your full attention. As Calcifer keeps telling Sophie, he's constantly giving her hints about the nature of his contract with Howl (being unable to tell her outright) but she keeps missing them.<br /><br />And that's not even mentioning the scarecrow that chases Sophie around the countryside, the disappearances of Wizard Suliman and Prince Justin, and the bizarre sights waiting for Sophie when Howl takes her to modern-day Wales...<br /><br />Sophie makes for an unorthodox heroine, not only in her enchantment that renders her an elderly woman, but in her practicality and dry wit. She makes a perfect foil for the flamboyant, dishonest, self-appreciative Howl, who tries to \\"slither out\\" of his predicaments rather than face them head-on. Sophie never hesitates in calling him out on his bad behavior, though it becomes clear as the story goes on that plenty of hidden depths exist beneath his drama-queen persona. There's also Calcifer, the sardonic and perhaps untrustworthy fire demon that controls the movement and magic of the castle, and Michael, Howl's good natured young apprentice who quickly befriends Sophie when she first arrives. All of them are vividly realized, and Wynne Jones is an expert in taking an impartial view of these people and their personalities, letting the reader judge for themselves what they're really like (in other words, she's a master of the \\"show, don't tell\\" rule).<br /><br />But Diana Wynne Jones's real gift is in how she makes magic so domestic - and therein lies its power and charm. Whether it be Calcifer nestling in the fireplace or Howl turning his home into a flower shop, everything weird and wonderful is treated so casually by the narrative that the perspective somehow flips on itself, becoming even *more* mysterious and potent to the reader. The inevitable comparison is the treatment of magic in [[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter]], wherein every spell and charm would be met with awe and excitement - here, magic is treated as an everyday occurrence, thereby rendering it even more thrilling.<br /><br />The ending is perhaps wrapped up a bit too hurriedly (such a complex storyline needed perhaps a *little* more exposition just to clarify things in the reader's mind) but remains one of Wynne Jones's best novels. Be sure to follow up on these characters' lives in the sequel: [[ASIN:0061478776 Castle in the Air]].<br /><br />Renewed interest in the author (and this book in particular) rose after the release of Studio Ghibli's adaptation of the story, which is [[ASIN:B00BEYYEIK currently available on DVD]]. Though I enjoyed the film, especially for its visual brilliance, it changes or omits several important elements of the storyline, leaving it rather convoluted as a result. It's better treated as supplemental material to the book than a straightforward adaption of it, but it's still very enjoyable in its own way.ce or Howl turning his home into a flower shop, everything weird and wonderful is treated so casually by the narrative that the perspective somehow flips on itself, becoming even *more* mysterious and potent to the reader.

B008I3RARW|4.0|My nephew really likes racing games. Would have give it another star but the options of colors and styles was a bit limited.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I can hardly wait for season 5 to be released. Can't get enough of it. Rewatch it again and again. Sheldon is the ultimate science nerd who just doesn't get it.
B001D0BLTA|4.0|this film is great when you're having some down time and you're just in need of an escape. I almost always go to old movies for a vacation with all the drama going around.
B000002VCE|5.0|The Outlaws are THE BEST Southern Rock Band!  Saw them in 1980 with Molly Hatchet who I also love..... What a GREAT SHOW
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|This album is just bad.  Any new artist wouldn't have gotten this released.  Of course, Lil Wayne is the man behind his publisher, so he can just put out whatever he wants.  This time he wanted to release an album about his favorite part of the female anatomy.  And he wanted to rap about it to some really bad music.  Of course, his raps aren't any better than the music.  If a room full of monkeys could randomly type out Shakespeare's works given enough time, those same monkeys could have typed out Wayne's raps on this album in about half an hour.  If you just have to get this album, wait for the next MP3 sale by Amazon.  This one is guaranteed to be there for $1.
B000002JSN|5.0|Wish I could've seen them in concert!  Had tix to see them in Chicago but, then John Bonham died :-(
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Mad man rant of essential truth and debunk of dogma foisted upon us by media, market place, academic and government.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I'he only done a few of these puzzle-quest games but they are engaging. I did have to refer to some cheats I found on YouTube but slowly I figured most of it out. I like that it was in 3 parts all related.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|The writing and artwork are top notch. The story makes you want more and more. Cannot wait to read through them all.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me years ago.  I finally got to read it and am I glad I did.  An engrossing story, told from the dog's point of view with humor and love.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great! I have not had any problems on Kindle! I definitely recommend this game if you like cards! I like the different options/settings!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Loved the interplay of characters - tough teen, jaded assassin, by-the-book govt employee. Never a dull or predictable minute - for the most part.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was a true favorite of mine. I saw and read a lot of other reviews and people seemed to feel very mixed about it. I think you have to be like Charlie, to understand or appreciate it. Honestly, when I read this book, I felt like I was Charlie. Not just because his character was written so well, but because I've gone through the things Charlie has gone through, and I see the world as Charlie does. I felt less alone by reading this book. I felt understood. Like the author had peered into my heart and wrote about me.<br /><br />As for the story line, I think that it went well and I was never bored when reading the book.  You know how some bookes get to a point where it's hard to get to the good parts again? The book was a quick, easy read and I loved it. I'm glad I decided to read it before watchingthe movie.  I remember when my friend saw it, I asked if was good and he paused and said &#34;yes, it's very deep. I heard it was based off of a book.&#34;  I knew I had to read and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This book isn't for everyone, but it's worth a shot to find out if fit is for you. Hopefully you will love it as much as I did.
B009ANP48G|4.0|The storyline, especially the romantic part is pretty cheesy. I knew it would be! I just bought this because the dancing still blows my mind!
B0091REZMW|3.0|... but sometimes crashes and will not open.  I am still unclear on how to make friends.  I deleted the game from my device so I could download again and now it won't download at all.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Kinda slow through the 1st half of the movie, but WOW to Sally Field! I wouldn't use the movie as my idea of the TRUTH as far as the civil war, but it was moving.
B000XNXM3Q|5.0|This album is very unique and and just has awesome music! Beck is one of my favorite artisits. Even though some of the songs seem weird, it just shows how unique Beck is.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is fun but not like the games I used to play. But will do for now.  Just a little more challenging.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My family and I really enjoyed this film! The kids loved the soundtrack and my husband and I loved seeing all the retro game characters used throughout! We rented this movie and ended up purchasing it!
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|It is one of the best saga ever! I am a huge fan, I love the story, everything... Waiting for the next one...
0307454568|5.0|The second book in Larsson's trilogy about Lisbeth Salander was better than the first, and the third is the best of all.  The last quarter of the book had me on the edge of my seat.  I couldn't put it down.  If you enjoyed either or both of the first two books, you simply have to read the third.  I will miss Lisbeth, as strange as that may sound.
B000002J6F|5.0|Stephen Stills, the man who formed this band with Chris Hillman was in my opinion at his peak- this band was genius and he would be hard pressed to ever top this release. Mixing rock, country, blues and Latin influences, he forged a masterpiece. Featuring outstanding musicians and inspired songs mostly written or co-written by Stephen Stills-there is a cohesiveness to this band that I don't think has ever been duplicated. I am only sorry that they did not stay together long enough to build a legacy-they were that good!!! Hall Of Fame Good-it is unfortunate that they have not been recognized. If you like Stephen Stills, you will love this band! Buy it!!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Another well written book by Child.  His books are always suspensefull!  I can't wait for the next one, and the one after that!
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I would give this set 10 Stars if I could!!!! Graham Nash & Joel Bernstein did a wonderful job presenting the career of one of the most important artists of the past 50 years. If you are or ever were a fan of Stephen Stills, buy this!!! From the amazing sound quality to the wonderful booklet, a  portrait of the man emerges and it is rock hard, soulful and brilliant!<br />From his inspired song writing to his beautiful voice and his virtuoso guitar skill (not to mention all the other instruments he can play as well as anyone), the essence of Stephen Stills as an artist is there for all to hear. Like other reviewers have noted, I wish that there were more live performances because he is truly electrifying live but I also realize that you can't please everyone and we should trust that they picked the best versions to showcase this amazing talent at his best. And best of all, I don't think he is done yet!  Rock On Stephen!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Had the most trouble staying with this story.  Books 1 and 2 are five stars.  This will be better on screen than in print.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This shell works great and provides everything I need to protect my Kindle.  I bought two , one each for my two Kindles.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My android was not useful out of the factory, kindle had to be added and it was a life saver.  It has not let me down, I have been reading book after book.
B008MPQ0R2|4.0|This is a great movie and is presented in a superb edition with an exquisite quality of audio and video. However &#34;Criterion Collection&#34; has only released this movie with english subtitles and no other one for european market (spanish, french, german or italian) That's my reason not to give 5 stars.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Amazon has been amazing helping me learn how to use this service.  I was a complete novice, having been addicted to books for sixty seven years..I needed lots of help.
B005HED08I|4.0|I admit, the rating is probably high because of the nostalgic flavor for someone in their mid-50's.  One thing that is there, however is a really good story line in the shows.  The acting can be funny and over the top, but that's what Star Trek was.
1476729719|5.0|I'm leaving for vacation tomorrow; busy packing so don't have time to do this justice ... however, be that as it may<br />I haven't read Jodi Picoult in a long time however my friend gave me Nineteen Minutes...read it she said: ...<br />LOVED IT ..  LOVED IT....LOVED IT... then I ordered 4 more Jodi Picoult novels &#34;good as new but not as expensive&#34;<br />Nineteen Minutes is unbelievable&#60;wait I mean very believable in our current news ..  it will surprise you...you will say &#34;I don't need to read this sadness, I have enough of my own&#34;  but you'll be caught by the rhythm (sp) by the vocabulary by the realness of the characters involved.  okay short of it:  READ IT  READ IT  READ IT
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|I love this app out of  all the radio apps I use. I only wish that when it updates that I can sign in. But all in all great app
1439102724|5.0|Really, I gotta go finish packing....somehow, somewhere.. I got hooked on Jodi Picoult and am &#34;consuming&#34; her books, running downstairs to say to my family:  &#34;listen to this&#34;  she not only entertains, she makes you think and consider new ideas.<br />go for it!!!!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|The length of the movie is over two hours, which normally warrants criticism.  However, not here.  The movie, like so many of Apatows productions, uses that extra time to develop relationships...And it works.
B003KRGCTI|5.0|Easy to see on my Roku and great quality. Nice option to seeing favorite movies.  Just need to figure out the download.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game.  Great graphics.  Fun to try to get all horses.  My little four year old sister adores it too.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Awesome movie for Bluray, has some decent seens to show off your picture quality to friends and great sound. Thanks
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Too hard to get the stuff to fall.I got bored easily.Wasn,t enough action to keep me wanting to play. Sorry
B000VDDWDS|5.0|The sound quality of this Bluray is in the top 3 of my collection.  When they have ship battles you can here every splinter of wood breaking. If you have a great surround sound system buy this bluray.
B00BR476TG|5.0|boy remains cool under very stressful conditions. The vivid color photography enhances the overall experience.Have to see a film like this more than once.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This has been a big hit with my three year old niece who loves horses. Some of the content is too complicated for her but it will make things interesting for older children
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book in many way rekindled my faith in NASA and the need to visit other planets even when everything could possibly go wrong. If anything, it reemphasizes the idea that space and space exploration are dangerous, risky, and yet necessary for our species.<br /><br />Andy Weir heavily researched this book and actually made me feel like I was there experiencing the drama his main character Watney went through while marooned on Mars. Ofttimes it was poignant and funny and answered the age-old question &#34;When would I ever need to know math?&#34;<br /><br />Read it. This is not some space fantasy to be ignored. Read it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My kids love Angry Birds and wanted to try Bad Piggies. Once they tried it, they were hooked. Even adults will be amused with it!!!
